I've always thoroughly tested everything but with ad hoc tests that I had to do over and over.<p>The main thing I miss with TDD is the interactive nature.  If I'm testing in Smalltalk I can write code right inside the debugger and watch the effect it has, but TDD always moves me back to what Smalltalkers call ""cult of the dead"" programming where I have to stop, run the tests and wait for the output.  I wish there was a way to make it more interactive.  It would be easier to force myself to do it then.",1288360724

You'd have to do it through a subsidiary.<p>Conversely, it's impossible for a Indian citizen to own individual ownership in a US company (unless it's through a company JV type arrangement, or he has a legal visa to work in the US - this is the founders dilemma that often plagues startups)<p>Additionally, it's near impossible to sue a foreign corporation without a US presence.<p>This whole situation is sticky, and the US ""investor"" has little leverage. One would think that if he really wanted to take 50% ownership of the company, he would have thought through all these issues - but he didn't.<p>Since he was the one that threatened to sue, you have to play hardball - you have to take that threat seriously, even though it might not be credible.<p>Rohan: Remember that any admission that equity should be given can later be used in court (if somehow, someway it ends up in a court case...but always prepare for the D-Day case)<p>Remember: you own the code, the servers, and the bank accounts. You control all the leverage. What has been said is done for now, but if I were you I would calculate all the hours you put into the project, and show that the $500 doesn't take you very fair.<p>Additionally, someone that ""wants 50% of the profits for the next 2 months"". Seriously, what kind of business arrangement is that?<p>As I said in another response, remember that he's also responsible for 50% of the costs. As managing partner, you can take on additional equity, and he'd have to match that, or risk being diluted.",1288360715

But I routinely use coverage as my guide to find things that might benefit from further testing, as in ""oooh this path is never tested and stuff is more likely to break here"".<p>I try really really hard not to write useless tests-I use tests to drive the development of my app. I need feature x, so I write a test for it. I end up with relatively high coverage because of that. And because I've gotten more disciplined over the years, I'm only implementing the stuff that passes my tests, so I'm less likely now to have things that aren't covered.<p>So, I view coverage as a guide, not a rule, but it's not a useless metric at all unless you designate an arbitrary percentage.",1288360527

The world isn't free.<p>""How does the 30 Day trial work?""\n- It's a 30 trial.  You don't have to pay till you've been using it for a month.  Haven't you ever seen an infomercial?  Are you even smart enough to write code?<p>""What browsers work with StorageRoom?""\n- StorageRoom is a modern web app and, if you're planning on giving me money, you should trust that I put the time in to test on more than one browser.

Also, I'd suggest you work to ensure the featured lists capture enough information to discourage forking them -- for example, you should collect geographic data in the job-related lists, and at some point allow filtering by location.

1847178,comment,1847118,1847118,0,0,devmonk,,,"Here is a copy of Kent's response:<p>""Kent Beck, <i>Husband, father, programmer, goat farmer.</i><p>The needs of a startup before product/market fit are very different than those after. Before, you need the absolute lowest possible latency from idea through implementation to validation. If you can do that without any code at all, so much the better. Reducing latency gives you the chance to experiment as many times as possible for a given amount of money to increase your chances of survival. After you find a product that meets a real market need, you need to shift to a throughput-oriented engineering strategy so you can last until revenue ramps up.<p>The practical implications of this for testing is that before product/market fit you should only write tests that reduce latency. Sometimes this means no automated tests. As a feature proves promising and you begin to elaborate it, this means just enough tests to keep the validation cycle short. If a feature is complicated AND YOU CAN'T THINK OF A CHEAP WAY TO TEST IT, you may have to write extensive tests to get the feature to a verifiable state.<p>Then comes the transition. You've started growing. You're feeling the pain of scaling. Now you need testing. More than that, though, the whole organization needs to begin valuing throughput instead of latency. If that shift takes place, then extensive testing comes along as a natural consequence.""<p>This is a far cry from TDD. I'm glad Kent wrote it, though, because it is so true.",1288358238

Sometimes this means no automated tests.""<p>I think this is a great point and perhaps explains the low support for TDD on HN.<p>In my experience the properties of a TDD project are: consistent flow rate of business value, low regression rate, low QA cost (assuming integration tests). It's the consistent flow rate which is perhaps most interesting.<p>At the start of a non TDD project it's easy to achieve a high velocity without tests. As the length of time from the start of the project increases the velocity will inevitably decline due to the increased complexity of the project and the greater level of QA required. Over a longer period the project without tests is going to tend towards a slower velocity until eventuality it hits a wall and it's big rewrite time.<p>For a TDD project the velocity curve is going to be different. You're going to see a slower start but once a velocity has been established it tends to stay fairly flat or increase. The XP guys talk about hyper-productive teams, there's no guarantee but you're far more likely to hit this point with a TDD project.<p>Increasing the number of features a product has and the number of team members will only exaggerate these two velocity curves.<p>There's another factor here as well, the knowledge of TDD within a team. The greater the TDD experience the smaller the difference will be in the starting velocity. With enough experience the velocity hit becomes small enough that the two curves can cross over very quickly.<p>The choice of strategy then becomes: are the velocity curves likely to cross over before or after you achieve market fit? Not an easy question to answer and one which is easy to ignore when everyone is excited about just getting something built.<p>edit: not sure what happened to the parent post, here's a link to Kent Beck's comments about testing before market fit <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-automated-testing-should-a-startup-have-from-the-beginning-through-the-first-six-months-of-live-operation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-automated-testing-should-a...</a>",1288357688

This is an issue, although I find it mitigated by the fact that you can still grab the handle and scroll more precisely with that.<p>point 2: Agree, but I think on balance in most situations, I'd rather have this than the old system. I have a feeling this can and will be refined somehow.<p>point 3: Agree, but there were annoyances with the old scrollbars, too, although somewhat less obvious ones.<p>point 4: It often is still obvious from context; for instance, alphabetized lists whose visible contents end in items beginning with ""b"" are a hint. :)",1320890367

No. Especially given that you have an incumbent political party that is (at least in name), still Communist and committed to the equitable distribution of wealth across the population.<p>China has a lot of internal tensions, not the least of which is that as people become more affluent, they start to want greater transparency from the government, greater fairness, and more independence. All of those desires put them in conflict with the current regime. The party may be able to keep things under control, but I don't think there's any question that it's already grappling to maintain order via censorship, suppression of dissent, etc.",1320890296

Also, because they are using the 'worst case numbers' some makes and or models could be safer when panted black etc.  Let alone changes in the type of drivers that chose specific colors.

But with these new scrollbars the following things can happen:<p>1. It's very hard to navigate a long list. For example, if you are in Mail.app somewhere in the middle of your messages, swipe scrolling all the way to the top can get very annoying, very fast. On iOS this isn't a problem because you can tap the top of the screen to zip up to the top, but this doesn't exist on OS X. Sure, you can always grab the knob once it shows up, but...<p>2. The knob is so small now that it is actually hard to grab. So when you do need to grab it, it sometimes takes a few clicks to get it. I feel bad for anyone with bad eyesight.<p>3. The scrollbars often overlap the content in incredibly annoying ways, for example if you are trying to select the last item in a horizontally scrolling list, the horizontal scroller will sit right on top of it and you have to wait for it to go away or you end up clicking it instead: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/NDxTb.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/NDxTb.png</a> . This happens all the time with the Open panel.<p>4. Not to mention the fact that it isn't immediately obvious anymore when you have additional content to scroll.",1320890153

I'm Mark Turner, the blogger who discovered this situation.<p>Thanks to the help of a few folks who commented on my blog, I was able to learn that the 28.x.x.x IP was assigned to my phone's interface. Thus it appears Sprint has ""borrowed"" addresses from the DoD. Because SIP packets contain the source IP (unlike the other traffic from my phone) the internal IP was leaking through Sprint's NATting, causing my confusion. It's all harmless, though a good argument for moving to IPv6!",1320888939

Plug in any controversial technology and the article sounds about the same: Al Gore on Global Warming vs a report claiming to debunk it, Microsoft on Silverlight vs a report claiming that it's no longer supported, James Randi on his $1,000,000 challenge vs someone claiming that their version of ESP really is real.<p>""<i>... the reaction on HN is heartening. Though it's disappointing it made it to the front page at all, it also seems that the bulk of the audience at HN took it with the grain of salt it deserved.</i>""<p>I'm unimpressed with this assessment.  HN participants were quick to identify the key issues of provenance while simultaneously picking apart the claims.  Regardless of whether this was a hoax -- I personally think it was an exaggerated rant of someone who was seriously frustrated -- isn't this how peer review is supposed to work? Someone makes a claim.  The claim and the claimant are assessed. Conclusions are drawn.  There's nothing disappointing about it.<p>In my opinion, HN worked efficiently and quickly to debunk or validate the claims.  The article needed to reach the front page in order to achieve a critical mass of participation in order to discover a consensus which seems to be that many of the claims were overblown or based on out-of-date information, but some were real. This conclusion was validated by 10gen's president Max Schireson,<p>""<i>... rather than deflecting the entire thing, Schireson and Horowitz were fairly candid about MongoDB's shortcomings. Of the nine sections, Schireson says that ""some are definitely valid, some we haven't heard or seen.""</i>""<p>Rather than feeling disappointed, the newsworthy aspect of this episode is <i>how well</i> the HN community and moderation system worked in this case, and how reasonable 10gen was in their response.  Many companies (e.g. British Petroleum on the Deep Horizon disaster) will continue to spin the news even when there is video evidence.<p>It would have been nice if ReadWriteWeb focused on that rather than attempting to paint a negative picture of community sourced news.",1320887433

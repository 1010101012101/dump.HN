Cavemen certainly didn't run this way, and we haven't evolved fast enough for our optimal mechanism to be any different.<p>There's plenty of evidence that humans have evolved to be better long-distance runners than any other animal.  The amount of impact energy returned by our tendons is highest, and human ultrarunners can go over 50 miles in one sitting.<p>For a couple weeks, my calves screamed and my feet were sore as they strengthened.

Sometimes these samples have been used by agencies to sell products that they will distribute to local vendors. Sample sales are often associated with the fashion industry. These sales are an opportunity to get near perfect merchandise at a fraction of the price. It is often difficult to have information on the date and time of sample sales, although there are websites which list information about sample sales in on line diaries. They are also used to draw in new clients, hoping that the new people will return to the company's store and buy more merchandise. While many sample sales pop in various locations in NYC, there are a [very small] handful of companies that have a permanent location. Clothingline.com is the longest running sample sale company in New York City.<p>Recently, a number of new online businesses have emerged that offer the sample sale concept to an online audience. Well-established in Europe with the original creator of online private sales, vente-privee.com[citation needed], this trend moved to the United States in 2007 with the launch of companies such as Savvy + Co., Gomatta Girls, Editors' Closet, Beyond the Rack, RueLaLa, Gilt Groupe and Ideeli.

One side says show us the evidence! The other side points to dozens of papers showing no link whatsoever. The other side doesn't say anything and then goes to another tv show and says show us the evidence!<p>It's ridiculous but it sure does teach you a lot about herd mentality.",1264781063

Second, the challenge in most features is in implementing it on their infrastructure in a scalable manner. Scalable implementation on Google infra is their core competency. I find it hard to believe they would want/need to talk to you about their core competency.<p>It appears that you are alluding to the recently-announced ability of Google Reader to track pages which don't have an RSS feed.<p>We're talking about a company which came up with an ultra-efficient way to send program <i>updates</i> (which involved disassembling an EXE, custom diffing considering jmp offsets, followed by reassembly).<p>Could you explain what unique unreproducible technology you have which Google might be interested in?<p>Best case scenario I foresee is a tiny ""employment by acquisition"" deal, if you can charm the right people.

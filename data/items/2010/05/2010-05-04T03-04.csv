When you direct them to a different site, even if it sort of looks like the original site, it's a big speed bump in the flow. Makes you stop and think (hey, what's going on?!) and question if you're in the right place (did I click the wrong button?!). You may even get suspicious and leave. You'd probably feel the same if at a supermarket when it's time to take out the card and pay, within seconds the building changes, the cashier is no longer there, the door you came through is gone, the lightning is different, the people who surrounded you disappeared; only the colors sort of look the same...",1272945576

It's been an incremental process, but at point I'd call my setup _more_ than adequate.  One of these day's I'm either going to update the OSX/Xmonad wiki page with my method with all of the scripts and configurations I am using under the hood...  In my opinion, much of the <i>magic</i> of integrating X11/Xmonad with aqua involves 'capturing' key combinations (on the Xmonad side), determining how to respond, then either responding directly or emitting the correct keystrokes using xdotool (<a href=""http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/</a>).<p>For example, I let xmonad capture the keysequence <Command-Tab>.  Xmonad keeps track of the MRU-like window list and switches to it.  If it is another window in the current workspace, xmonad can switch to it unassisted.  If a 'switch' would involve switching to an <i>aqua</i> application, xmonad then uses xdotool to emit the <Command-Option-A> + <Command-Tab> key sequence (popping out of X11).",1272945395

As a user, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't screw around with paying you since my data is important and continued access to the service.  Businesses write checks all the time, especially for software purchases and services.  This would pretty much eliminate the need for processing fees and all this crud.

The idea that a merchant account isn't a bank account at all is non-obvious to everyone I've walked through payments hell with.  Recurring billing, in particular, is a huge pain in the ass, especially with upgrades and downgrades that users do as they try to optimize their freemium subscriptions.  (There wouldn't be at least four companies doing just this if it wasn't a total PITA.)  If you're not built in Ruby, and you can't use ActiveMerchant, you really have to evaluate the documentation for each of the various gateways - and good luck finding out the names of all of them - before you can even begin.  AmEx, in particular, is a whole 'nother circle of hell, although OnePoint solves a lot of these issues (but, of course, for a price).<p>Honest to God, I'm going to try to learn Ruby this summer purely because ActiveMerchant exists.

I wanted to call out a number of things I glossed over to see if it's worth doing a follow up or seventeen:<p><pre><code>  * Personal guarantee.  Most merchant account providers require a personal guarantee.  I signed one for Dawdle.com, but I never would again, even if it costs me more.
  * Recurring billing.  There are a number of startups focused here, including Recurly, Chargify, Spreedly, and CheddarGetter.
  * PCI compliance.  The physical access tenet makes it technically impossible to be compliant if you're using any cloud hosting provider for e-commerce; in reality, almost no one is PCI compliant.
  * Gateways.  There are a bunch.  ActiveMerchant (Ruby gem open sourced by the good folks at Shopify) can do basic handshakes with most.  There isn't an AM equivalent for Python, PHP, or other common languages that I know of.
  * Processors.  First Data ostensibly processes 75% of credit cards in the U.S.  This is a more academic topic than the others, but it's terribly interesting if you want to understand why online payments are the clusterfuck they are.
  * Chargebacks.  You'll almost never win one.
  * AVS and CVV.  They protect you, but goddamn, are they expensive to process.  AVS can sometimes cost you a dime (or more!) every time you check a card - and it rarely works on non-U.S. addresses (and American Express often fucks up apartment addresses even within the U.S.).
  * Vaults versus reference transactions.  Reference transactions are an elegant way to handle credit card data, but they lock you into the gateway.  Vaults give you portability, but those providers are always more expensive than the ref tranx folks.</code></pre>",1272943024

Going this route sounds nice but the battles and bloat would be immense.  The web is a thin client, it can do fat client stuff but it is ultimately designed to be thin.  That is what made it ubiquitous, not being a fat client...<p>What this is, is making an application for the desktop.  They can take a branch of Webkit or Firefox and add CLI but they could also just make their own downloadable app to do this.<p>I like the idea I just think this might wreck the one standard thing we got going in javascript as the glue of the web.  A scripting language can bend to the changes as it has done with minimal versions.  It could be faster and bytecode itself sure but still it has worked well to tie things together. Silverlight and Flash can partially do this but you still have sandbox issues, which it would also have to have.  You'd still have limitations yet it would be a jungle. Right now the jungle is the plugin.  Lots of innovation but also lots of differentiation, legacy, etc.<p>I do think that the browser cache needs more space, Javascript engines could be faster, Canvas support and hardware acceleration are needed quickly.  Maybe the CLI would be the way but everything we do with the web is design by committee, most of the stuff that made it in that works so well was made when they were still small and non-existent as a market.

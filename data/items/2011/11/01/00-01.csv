(One of my favorite interview questions requires people to understand escape sequences in a slightly more abstract way than usual, and you'd be surprised.)<p>In general I find that people do better with concrete examples and struggle with abstract rules. It's not at all obvious to a JavaScript programmer (for example) that asynchronous calls have anything to do with monads, and the designers of mainstream languages have to be very aware of their audience.<p>So, my question is how extending the type system might be turned into a concrete feature in a ""mainstream"" language.

Which just so happened to be python, but I agree it probably doesn't matter, but from my experience don't use the same language you use at work everyday.<p>I'm not sure if I'm alone but I spend WAY to much time in front of my computer. 8-10 hours a day working, and then I often use my laptop casually to write stuff at night in front of the TV.<p>There came a point several years ago where I became disgusted with Windows. Not so much Microsoft, more enterprise infrastructure teams. But the negativity flowed over to personal use. So I brought a mac for personal use, I wanted the disconnect between work and fun. Windows for me is over, I'll never have another Windows machine in my house... in fact it will mainly be appliances for me... and by that I mean Apple products.<p>For a long time I plugged on using mono, but I lost the drive to program it just wasn't fun anymore. I'd get 80-90% of the way through a project and just hate finishing it. As soon as the fun exploration bit was over and I had to spend time aligning pixels or whatever it just felt like work. I hated it.<p>By pure chance I started using python to show my unskilled friend some ideas. He could follow python without much guidance, C# confused him. Since then I've grown to enjoy programming in the evensong again. I'm not sure if its the same disconnect I needed between work/fun or what... but its working.<p>Especially the ability to sit with my macbook, feet up on lazy chair, half watching TV, terminal open testing bits and pieces, IDE doing the thinking for me (PyCharm gets a thumbs up from me), and a nice hassle free (and inspectable) stack. The casual nature of python just seems to click perfectly with my mood in the evenings.<p>So theres my advice for languages, separate work and fun.

To address your semi-rhetorical question, this model is easily adaptable to anything that you want to casually learn (excluding what I'll call ""traditional education spheres""). That is to say, right now it's incredibly difficult both to offer to teach a cooking class in your community and to find a cooking class to take. Thinking about Niroka as a way to connect people with skills willing to teach to people interested in learning new hobbies is better than thinking about it as a place to go to learn (blank). If they grow and expand in this way, Niroka would become the starting point if you're interested in learning a new skill that can't easily be absorbed through what's currently available on YouTube or printed on the web (this also presents people who do offer some of these services that way an easy way to monetize). In a similar vein, it can also be easily adapted to handle scheduling for small businesses dedicated to teaching schools (in exchange for a cut, they maintain the schedule of classes and provide a large potential audience for say, a local pottery place or yarn store, etc.) The harder market to tackle would be traditional education where topics can require highly specialized knowledge and fall prey to bad teachers.",1320106756

Because of this, the market never develops and support is dropped from the device before the bugs are worked out. Even if you end up with a stable driver, it'll stop working the next time there is an OS upgrade. So you end up running 10.n, while everyone else is on n+1, then n+2, then no more security upgrades, so you have to switch to n+2 and throw away the now useless $1000 box.<p>(Not only this, but reading the ExpressBox materials it seems each PCIe card maker is going to have to write a custom driver that specifically targets the ExpressBox.

Non-believers will burn, says so Jesus. And if you ask any priest from any of the major Christian churches, like Catholic, Eastern Orthodox (my own), Protestant, the answer will be without doubt Yes.<p>Of course, there's always Jehova's witnesses, that simply rewrote the bible, but I don't think that counts.<p>There's nothing wrong with inventing your own religion based on a good set of moral values, especially casting away anything that leads to hatred of other people (dare I say it, Jesus would probably agree) and I do that myself, however I wouldn't shout from the roof-tops that I'm a Christian as that would be a little bending of the truth.",1320106064

So, a desktop machine could be chewing twice the power per hour of uptime, while still using less overall.<p>And, of course, servers are a more efficient use of power.  A modestly loaded server is doing work for hundreds or thousands of users every day, while a desktop PC is only working for one, maybe a handful if it's a communal machine.<p>Anyway, I don't know the precise numbers, but I would strongly suspect that the average server is using more power per year than the average desktop computer.  Could I be wrong about that?  Sure.  I don't think I am...but even if I were, it doesn't alter the reality of environmental impact of data centers (though I suspect the production stage may be the computer industries real environmental shame).",1231822612

431642,comment,431076,431360,0,0,stcredzero,,,"You're talking about ordinary desktop applications.  For that, a package manager like dpkg and apt-get will work just fine.  I thought that the article was talking about applets, which aren't meant to be permanently installed on the local machine.  However, they have a dependency on a Java runtime which is installed there.  If the designers of Java were a little more forward thinking, they wouldn't have created this dependency.  The desktop JRE would be managed by whatever mechanism on the machine, but the applet JRE would be managed separately.  The entire thing could be managed by a program implemented in just about any programming language.  Let's say it's the 1st version of the JRE.  Combine this with a mechanism that effectively sandboxes an applet with whichever version of the JRE it needs or is most compatible with, and at worst, a user will be notified that they need to wait for a download.<p>In this regard, the designers of Java were thinking like programmers and not thinking of naive end users.  Flash does a better job in this regard.",1231821710

It's hard enough to validate an app against one set of software versions.  I can't think of a single time when implying forward compatibility worked right.  DLL Hell on windows, and any time your libraries got upgraded while in the middle of a dev cycle in maven, just makes things <i>hurt</i>.<p>Just let the application's metadata (e.g. jar manifest) indicate what it wants, and give it exactly that.  If we want efficiency, we'll delta-encode different versions against each other.  When automated testing is implemented widely enough, and well enough, for us to trust forward compatibility without human intervention, then we can go down that route.",1231821511

Commenting on blogs are sort of in between those two (really, a discussion if the blogger also comments, as they often do).<p>Some kind of threaded comments might help. e.g. on reddit, you can compress the joke-thread and the pun-thread, to get to the on-topic commentary. A ""typo thread""?

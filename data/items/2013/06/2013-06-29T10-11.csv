Nothing impossible to deal with though.<p>The FFI of Ur/Web is low level and easy to use. This made interfacing with existing C routines easy.

You can&#x27;t simply hide behind the assertion that the US is just another one of many countries vying for supremacy. For better or worse, the US sets the tone and the precedences for all of the Western countries&#x27; policies, and to top it off it is by far the most powerful when it comes to the military and secret services. You - a US citizen - might interpret this to mean that things are going well and that &quot;might makes right&quot; and all that, but the moral bankruptcy of such a view should be obvious to pretty much everybody.<p>I&#x27;m a EU citizen and as such subject to yet more surveillance from my home countries and that&#x27;s bad enough in of itself. However, the EU does not project its power outward at such a massive scale as the US does. <i>In effect, the sum of US policy, international role, and military action means that I am subject to the US at all times, yet I do not have &quot;real person&quot; status.</i><p>Germany is by far not perfect, and has its own share of secret service scandals to look back on, but at least the German constitution grants fundamental rights to <i>every human being</i>, not just citizens. In an era where state and corporate powers are used so abundantly, so disproportionally, and with so much moral corruption, this kind of constitutional scope is clearly the way to go forward. Yes, citizens need special protection, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everybody else is just a bag of meat. In fact, as a member of the civilized world, I kind of <i>expect</i> the many host countries I travel to to protect me as well.<p>The US lulls other Westerners into the illusion that you&#x27;re our friends, yet this is evidently an absolutely one-sided pact. You take for yourselves sweeping rights and powers without oversight (both external and, let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, internally as well), and you expect other people to bow and be exploited. Your response to this as a US citizen <i>cannot</i> with any ethical justification be along the lines of &quot;well, if you can&#x27;t make us stop doing this, you are too weak and deserve everything we deem appropriate&quot;.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not interested in ethics, and you really should be because it has everything to do with protecting groups of people <i>you are not a part of</i>, you could at least view it from a practical perspective: this attitude is incredibly damaging to the Western civilization as a whole.

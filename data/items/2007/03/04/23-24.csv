I'm guessing they wouldn't make it on that list.<p>It is a dangerous path to become a standard fanatic for an entrepreneur and sites such as this encourage it. When my site goes live, the site layout showing up right in common browsers is more critical than having a ""Trophy Homepage"" powered by ""Nothing But CSS.""<p>That said, some inspirational designs!\n",1173052463

I'll join you. :)\nIn all seriousness, its about building something that I can say ""Yeah, that was me."" not hide my face anytime someone mentions the product.  It is nice to have the freedom to build effective, beautiful products, and the money is a nice kicker too, but it really comes down to not regretting my life.  20, 30, or 40 years spent building things for other people, things that aren't the best, or things that aren't pride inspiring, its not for me thank you.",1173052111

People back then didn't have any other channel to reach potential users, than marketting, which they had to pay. <p>The web is a new place, and the market is broader and global. You can be next to your grandma in Greece and sell to a client as far as Brazil through word of mouth......<p>my friends don't let some static minds trick you.<p>shall the best (lim best -&gt oo) win ;) ...<p>",1173051362

I don't know that it does or doesn't, but certainly the arguments against bailing out Fisker and Solyndra and blowing a lot of tax payer money are the same as for not bailing out Tesla, which I think (and I may prove to be wrong over time) is looking like it could become a significant win for US industry in the long run, and probably well worth bailing out.<p>When you consider the sheer volume of dollars spent on Detroit's auto industry and the fossil fuel industry these numbers look much better in perspective.",1366268397

The asset pipeline provides a lot of functionality but not a lot of simplicity or management of complexity. If what you wish you had from rails is the asset pipeline you are either either an expert with with rails api or you are seeing things greener on the other side of the fence.<p>I don't mean to insult the asset pipeline, it provides a lot. But it definitely doesn't save you hours. Out of the box the asset pipeline is great for all the things that come for free but if you are doing a lot of development in the framework you probably return to the asset pipeline documentation on a regular basis. And I consider time spent in documentation a negative compared to time finding your own solution if the API is not intuitive and you find yourself consistently returning to the docs about similar problems. And let me tell you, plenty of my fellow Rails devs have said to me they also regularly return to the asset pipeline docs.",1366266426

Forgetting a condom can be easy in the heat of the moment, especially if there was a long 'wait' before hand. However, my friends had good self control... until we got one excessively drunk and sent her home. She ended up at her boyfriends who'd been out at a party himself. 9 months later they had a kid, literally from a 1 time mistake.<p>I've always had strong self-control. Even when I'm excessively drunk (and I tolerate alcohol well) I am in control. I've never behaved far from the norm when intoxicated, I've had the piece of mind to ensure my wife takes her birth control pill when I've been acting like the ball in a game of pong whilst going down a corridor.<p>Self-control is certainly a strong factor in the gray areas. I would bet money that most rapists don't have a problem with self-control, I would say the ability to wait until an opportune time shows a high degree of self-control; a self-control issue would be an old man on a train squeezing a school girls ass. I would say rapists have an impulse-control disorder, they're willing to gamble a minor short-term gain for a huge long-term loss. Someone with self-control issue tends to gamble a small short-term gain with an normal long-term loss.<p>Having children isn't a life-ending consequence of having sex. In fact, it's down right average. Going to jail <i>is</i> a life-ending consequence for the majority of people.<p>A 15 year old having unprotected sex is more an impulse control disorder than a 25 year old.

Google knows they're all you.<p>In the original Gawker story, this caught my eye:<p>""...pulled up the person's email account...[and] a list of other Gmail addresses that the friend had registered but didn't think were linked to their main account—within seconds""<p>Keeping separate Gmail accounts is how many protect against ""Google knows everything about me."" In fact on Google's ""What Google knows about you"" page, it never crosses accounts (unless you've manually connected them).
This story basically tells us the ""What we know about your account"" page is a bit misleading.
Of course most folks in IT know it's a bit naive to think one could never figure out that different gmail accounts are related.  But it was interesting that Google pretty formally knows the relationship, but doesn't tell you right where it should.<p>* SREs, and their level of access.<p>It's not so much that I care is a specific group has lots of access. I care that not that many groups do in total. This story makes me concerned that actually many groups have lots of access. Despite the ""elite navy seal"" vibe presented in the Gawker story about SREs, I'm now thinking that many, many teams have this kind of access. (Previous to this story, I was led to believe that SREs were quite low level (not in importance. but in nature of responsibilities. Very performance oriented, having little reason to have access to an individual user's data.).<p>Please feel free to jump in and correct this, Google peeps. It would make me feel better.<p>* What this does for SaaS and web apps in general<p>I love Google Docs and sincerely believe that most web apps that allow across-the-net collaboration are good for us. And are preferable to The Old Way.
I want people to TRUST their stuff to Google (and Github and Amazon, etc).<p>I hate security FUDers who love to derail conversations of great possibility with some far out scenario, ""Can my enemy see my Google Docs?!?!""<p>I'm way less worried about a few creeps who work at Google (they work everywhere...) and more concerned about laissez-faire access processes.",1284521332

1693170,comment,1692932,1692932,0,0,geuis,,,"Ok, some thoughts after reading through some of the comments both here and on the original article.<p>1) If you are putting words onto a website, you are not designing anything. You are publishing content. That content can be a story, a comment, an ad, etc. You are not designing or building a site. You are not a web designer nor a developer.<p>2) If you have received a graphic representation of a site (say from a graphic designer) and are implementing that design into a functioning page using wysiwyg-ish tools that do not require you to know how the underlying html & css technologies, you are building a site. Despite the use of tools, the end result is a page that works in at least one browser. You are the base-level web developer. However, you will <i>never</i> work for me until you learn html, css, and probably javascript too.<p>3) If you are only a graphic designer and you are pushing pixels to create a site layout, you are nominally a web designer. It is permissible for a pixel-pusher to do nothing <i>but</i> design, but unless you have some moderate level of actual coding you are doing a disservice to yourself and your coworkers. One of my biggest continuing gripes over the years is being given visual layouts that look interesting, but are nearly impossible to implement cleanly. A related issue is that graphic designers who never actually build sites nearly always leave major gaps in the UX of their designs. They don't think through every aspect of their design (what are the hover states, what should it look like when the mouse is here or here, etc). Essentially, if you are <i>only</i> a graphic designer you will not work for me unless you have some actual <i>developer</i> experience.<p>In the end, you can get a spectrum from #2-#3. I am a web developer who has been doing this for something like 10 years. I have moderate photoshop skills and have created my own designs before. But I'm only adequate at design.<p>Other people I have worked with are primarily graphic designers that are adequate at developing. They make amazing looking designs that sometimes have a few UX problems. However, when you put that kind of person with a developer like me, you can hit a nice sweet spot where we understand enough of each other's worlds that we can really get some shit done.<p>Finally, my tweet from a few weeks ago about this very problem, <a href=""http://twitter.com/geuis/status/22554072991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/geuis/status/22554072991</a>",1284520495

You asked why I didn't focus on them, and it's because it's hard to think of any examples of business titans who are known for their hard work ethic and nothing else. For example, I might have said Michael Dell, but it turns out that he just paid off the SEC to remain CEO of his company after it was discovered that 75% of Dell's 2007 (I think) revenue came from illegal anti-competitive payoffs from Intel to not use AMD chips.<p>What I said (which also happens to be what I meant) was that there was a higher probability that someone with a vast sum of money had reached their level of wealth by harming someone relative to someone without that same level of wealth.

They lost in 2006 with LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Carmelo Anthony.  It's also important to note that several of the best non-U.S. pros sat out this tournament, also.  Notably, Pau Gasol, the second best player on the champion Lakers and probably the best big man in the world right now.<p>The U.S. had to rethink the way they ran their national program after getting embarrassed, getting more continuity with players committing to multiple years.  Wade, James, and Anthony came back after losing in 2006 to put on a dominating performance during the 2008 Olympics.  I was extremely impressed with how this current team was put together, because I thought they would have trouble handling the much taller teams they would face. Instead, the U.S. smaller but quicker and more athletic players created trouble for the taller teams they faced by stealing the ball and getting out for dunks and layups.  Also, Kevin Durant is a beast.<p>In short, I actually believe that the quality of U.S. basketball got better as a response to the improvement in the international game and the realization that it was not a glorified exhibition.  That's quite the sea change from what the original Dream Team faced in 1992.<p>Back to baseball, here are the 2009 rosters.<p><a href=""http://web.worldbaseballclassic.com/rosters/index.jsp?team=usa&season=2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.worldbaseballclassic.com/rosters/index.jsp?team=u...</a><p>Just clicking around, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic are loaded with many of the most famous MLB names.

Japan has several major leaguers and of course they have the second best professional league in the world (I don't think there's much dispute about that).<p>So I think with basketball we have re-asserted ourselves as the dominant world power, but only with a renewed dedication and commitment to get back to that place.  I still stand behind my argument that the quality of baseball player development is now better in some other countries than the U.S.  This is very much like the English Premier League, considered the best league in the world, and with many English stars, but not enough to make England a dominant football power.<p>And yes, maybe I think about this stuff just a little too much. :)",1284520001

CDOs are made up of a collection of asset backed securities, and even running a cashflow model, prepayment model and interest rate model on each of those individually can take up to 10 seconds (Sorry for the financial terms). On top of that, there's thing called OAS (option adjusted spread) which is a type of Monte Carlo simulations and quite intensive. A lot of places were not able to properly price their CDOs due to the intensive nature of the calculations but Goldman could.<p>To be honest, Buffett's interest in Goldman and his friendship with Obama could have had some play in the government's interaction with them.<p>The real issue here, is that all the models and ratings on these securities did not correlate the failure of similar bonds with similar underlying collateral. When running the models, they had something like 10% cross correlation between different bonds with extremely similar collateral according to someone who used to work at Fitch. In reality it should have been something like 50 to 75%.",1284519978

I see that the chances of picking a grey building the above is 1/2, but I assert that the set of possibilities for the children is ""two girls"", ""different genders"" and ""two boys"".  But yours is a good explanation, I see that that ""different genders"" state has a double chance of occurring compared to the other two states.<p>The Wikipedia article I cited above is interesting in that in one explanation, it bases the different results on interpretation of the givens.

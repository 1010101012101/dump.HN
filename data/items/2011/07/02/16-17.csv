For instance, I don't think you can export your search history or the archive for a google group. You can export your ""contacts"" but not all of your social connections (at least I haven't found a way). I also haven't found a way to export saved maps or other geo data.<p>If they expand this policy to all (or essentially all) of your data, they are pretty much immune to anti-trust. And more importantly, it's just better for users. Google has nothing to fear giving your data back to you, anyway -- the only companies that are afraid of that are the less competent ones.",1309625918

2721878,comment,2721637,2721637,2,0,rkalla,,,"This seems like a lot more than an ""IDE in the cloud"" -- they have this great monetization angle of letting you publish your apps directly into their ""App Store"" (something like Google App Engine but also a store front for customers?) and apps that people ""purchase"" through the app store have the added benefit of allowing you to automatically roll out updates to them in this controlled fashion.<p>If these were client-only JS apps, the idea of auto-update makes no sense, but given that this is all geared at client/server apps all written in JS, deploying that into an app-engine-esque execution environment that also doubles as an app store... that's a really creative idea.<p>For example, imagine if Amazon had an ""App Store"" front end for all the commercial apps on EC2 that wanted to integrate with it? Or Google App Engine did?<p>Would make for a very cool discovery method for customers to find cool apps and add a level of convenience for both the developer to notify/communicate with their customers as well as the customers to learn about new apps, get notified in a unified way of new features in their favorite apps, etc.<p>ASIDE: When I first heard Apple was doing a Mac App Store, I thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard. After using it, I can safely say I am an idiot and it's fantastically convenient.<p>I've come around on this whole app-store-for-all-sorts-of-crap idea... when done right, they can be a really nice thing. That being said, I am not looking forward to a future where I juggle 10 of them, 1 from each major vendor and one for each cell carrier. There is a limit.",1309625231

IANAL, but he seems to be saying if he allows WiFi to be called a 'radio communication' then it will suddenly be legal to wiretap a lot of things that are presently illegal.<p>Quite specifically the judge mentions:<p><i>Section 2511(2)(g) makes it lawful to intentionally intercept any radio communication that that relates to ships, aircraft, vehicles, or person in distress, without reference to whether such radio communication was readily accessible to the general public and not scrambled or encrypted. Should the Court interpret radio communication so broadly within the Act to include such technologies as wireless internet and cellular phones, this exception could lead to absurd results. Specifically, pursuant to this interpretation, an unauthorized intentional monitoring of a cellular phone call could be lawful should the content of the communication relate to vehicles or persons in\ndistress, but unlawful otherwise. Further, Section 2511(2)(g) makes it lawful to intentionally intercept any radio communication transmitted by any marine or aeronautical communications system, which could lead to equally arbitrary results when applying the exception to\ncommunications technologies other than radio broadcast technologies, e.g., a Wi-Fi network aboard an airplane.</i><p>Note the <i>any radio communication</i> and that the act actually doesn't prohibit that interception even if it's scrambled or encrypted.<p>His problem is that if he allows Google to call Wifi radio communication suddenly it's legal to wiretap people's encrypted wifi traffic as long as it relates to vehicles or if it's aboard a plane or boat.<p>Basically, in my brief scanning, he seems to be saying 'Congress, this could open an absurdly tricky loophole if I say yes, please do something'.",1309623727

The fact that Google is trying to exploit their search dominance to funnel people into a Facebook competitor screams ""anti-trust violation"" to me, and the information-control consequences make me a little woozy -- I'd rather that Facebook dominate the space completely than give Google any more of my personal information.  Google+ may not be evil, but it isn't exactly lily-pure, either.<p>I'm hoping that this is another classic case of Nerd Blindness (much like Rob Malda's famous proclamation that the original iPod was 'lame'):  Google has an exceptionally good technical reputation, so techies are foaming at the mouth to get access to their newest plaything, while <i>everyone else</i> just sees this as an attempt by a gigantic company to destroy a good service that it sees as a threat.<p>Cheering for Google to win in the social network space seems to be to be a bit like hoping that IBM will take down Microsoft.

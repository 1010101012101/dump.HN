5729928,comment,5728832,5729835,1,0,SatvikBeri,,,"<i>The market cap does not inherently increase according to the dollar amount you raised.</i><p>Good point. It all comes down to the (perceived) return on investment that a company can get using its cash.<p>In cases where companies are selling stock to raise cash it's usually perceived that the company will be able to get a decent ROI. So in most cases where a company raises cash (through funding or sale of stock) their market value will stay constant or increase. This is Tesla's situation.<p>In contrast Apple/Google/Cisco have shown very little ability to get a high return on investment on any additional cash, because they already have so much. This ROI is perceived by investors to be lower than what the investors could get on their own, which is why the cash is discounted.",1368903547
5729927,comment,5728422,5729815,1,0,mcgwiz,,,"Very interesting. So it sounds like the problem is effecting a native experience with HTML5 (something, notably, that Windows 8 gives first-class support to). So then, given the HTML5 expertise and attention to detail, would you recommend PhoneGap? Or would you still advocate separate, native efforts? (Or something else?)<p>Also, do you really think adding media queries to the stylesheet(s) is ""substantial relative to native tools""? Taken holistically, I would think that when you're targeting multiple platforms, you expend much greater effort building natively for each platform. Using those native UI tools to provide a good experience for variable aspect ratios actually entails knowledge of different languages, build tools, runtimes, standard libraries, third-pary library ecosystem, and best practices related to all the above.",1368903539

5729915,comment,5729623,5729623,5,0,eridius,,,"I'm only a couple paragraphs in, but there's already some pretty heavy bias here that's turning me off from continuing.<p>First off, the recommendation right off the bat is (paraphrased) ""Companies should use Mercurial because it's easier to learn, which translates to saving time and money"". Even if I accept that it's easier to learn, this completely ignores any consideration about interoperability with existing open source projects that you may or may not need, or the existence of any tools built around git or mercurial that you may want to use. The learning curve is but one factor that should be taken into consideration; it is not the <i>only</i> factor.<p>Secondly, the very first actual comparison between the two is highly disingenuous. It makes a claim about the documentation for `git commit` vs `hg commit` using what it <i>says</i> the summary of each command is. But that's not the summary. That's just the first line of the in-depth documentation. The actual summary of both commands, which is the very first real line of text you see in the help on both, is as follows:<p><pre><code>    git-commit - Record changes to the repository\n</code></pre>\npretty straightforward. And for `hg commit`:<p><pre><code>    commit the specified files or all outstanding changes\n</code></pre>\nAlso pretty straightforward. But these lines have been completely bypassed in order to provide a comparison that uses more technical language on the part of git and therefore is perhaps less understandable for a nontechnical user.<p>---<p>If we continue onwards, we find more absurd comparisons. There's a nice little ding against git here for actually listing its options in the synopsis, which is standard behavior for unix utilities, unlike hg which just says `[OPTION]...`. Sorry Robert, but git definitely wins that one.<p>And then he goes on to complain about terminology used in the description of `git checkout`, such as ""working tree"", even though these terms are well defined for git and are used consistently in all documentation (definitely a plus). But he doesn't mind terminology used in `hg update`, such as ""working directory"" or ""changeset"". You can't do an objective comparison between two VCS's learning curve unless you're willing to actually assume the user has no prior knowledge of the VCS. Big fail on Robert's part. And it's enough to make me stop reading here.",1368903352

5729890,comment,5729564,5729564,39,0,dnautics,,,"One suspicion I've always have is that high frequency radio waves can induce microcurrents in supercoiled DNA.  It's been speculated by the Barton lab that the base excision repair error-correction mechanism actively surveys DNA by injecting electrical current into the DNA and 'searching' for lesions which disrupt the conductivity of DNA.  Some circumstantial evidence for this is that a major ""base excision repair"" component has a redox-active iron-sulfur cluster, and at least one study shows that the oxidation state of this iron-sulfur cluster can change how well it attaches to DNA.<p>The mantra that we always hear is that if the radiation isn't ionizing it's harmless.  While this mechanism for worrying about non-ionizing radiation doesn't <i>directly</i> cause harm, it's not quite 'harmless' either.<p>This mechanism would render quite a few results not surprising.  Biologically, there are many stages where not having DNA error correction could be more catastrophic than usual.  It makes sense that seed germination is one of these; temporarily decreased sperm count in human males would be another.<p>The experiment to check this hypothesis is pretty obvious, and I'll probably be doing it sometime in the next few years, especially if I can get my nonprofit research org. up and running.<p>Edit: Footnote\n[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Barton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Barton</a>",1368902962

(In California, the CSU system is about half that for residents, I think, although UC is pretty close to that)<p>When you go, be prepared to learn about more than computers.  Learn to write and speak.  Learn History and Philosophy.  Lean Psychology and Biology.  Learn Art and Music.  Learn how other people outside of the sciences think.  Take in the abstractions that come with the Math classes that will go with your C.S. studies.<p>I also knew I was going to do C.S. before I started my freshman year at CSU, having spent some time looking into it before hand, but there is a lot to explore while you are there.  (my family couldn't afford a computer in the late 70s / early 80s, so I didn't learn any programming until senior year of high school.  I did manage to learn about binary, BCD, fixed precision arithmetic, simple encryption, hex math and a few other things in our grade school and middle school libraries, though, as well as wiring and soldering electronics at home)  Use that as an advantage to make sure your class selections are progressing towards your major and degree.<p>To the author's point, though, when I went to CSU starting in 1983, it was about $500 / year in fees, going up to about $1000/yr when I finished in '88 (yeah, it's been a while).

Berkshire Hathaway has also regularly demonstrated this principle in action over the last 20 years. Cisco has been demonstrating it for a decade as well. None of these companies have seen their market valuations well supported or increased by huge cash positions, their cash is and was always heavily discounted (in the case of MSFT and AAPL it's not viewed as particularly valuable because it can't or won't likely be used to fuel growth, but rather discharged gradually as a modest dividend, or left to rot on the balance sheet earning very little; in the case of Berkshire, the market would rather see Buffett doing acquisitions or holding equities to boost the return (both of which he prefers to cash)).<p>There are a lot of companies that are publicly traded, where if you calculated their cash as part of their market valuation, they'd be trading at extremely low discounts (eg AAPL at 6 times earnings).

In 1776 we established that it is advantageous to a have a government which its people are capable of overthrowing. That understanding turns out to generalize well. Jefferson said it best: ""When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.""<p>You never want to give the government so much power that its people can no longer stop it should its leaders turn malicious. The problem is that the argument that government power <i>could</i> be used for malicious purposes is not heard until it actually <i>is</i>, and by that point it is too late. What you fail to stop with words and votes in 1933 you are then forced to stop with bombs and blood through 1945.<p>But we have short memories. King George is someone you read about in the history books. The men and women who fought (or survived) the Nazis are mostly dead now, as are the Japanese held in internment camps. Joe McCarthy was dead by the time most of us were born. Stalin is gone and the Russians are our ""friends"" now. Rwanda was far away and we don't know any of those people. The things <i>our</i> government does are generally somewhat less bad than the things <i>those</i> governments did, which makes constitutional provisions that impede tyranny start to look more like the proverbial bear-repelling rock rather than the cause of that fact.<p>And it wasn't so long ago that some hell-bound sons of bitches made a permanent modification to the New York City skyline. Which tempts us to forget the millions who have died at the hands of bad governments in order to avenge the thousands who died in the towers.<p>People want simple solutions. The FBI says they want X. They say X will help the FBI catch terrorists. But it will also help the Chinese government catch dissidents. It will help dictators catch revolutionaries. It will help terrorists and foreign governments conduct espionage. The FBI doesn't tell you that part.",1368901644

The bar for an application tends to be much higher than a web page; a fantastic web page may be pretty shit when compared against the app bar. Users have fundamentally different expectations around responsiveness, interaction and fluidity for an app that they had to go install as opposed to a site they visited.<p>Apps demands certain responsiveness, and replicating that behavior in HTML is exceptionally difficult and leaves the user with a bunch of UI behaviors that are close, but not quite right. Fluidity in user interactions, specific scrolling behaviors and so on that are exceptionally difficult to replicate across platforms.<p>A browser is also a pretty leaky abstraction. Targeting an API level in Android guarantees a specific set of behavior and functionality, but targeting a browser offers no such guarantees. The Samsung Galaxy S2 has a modified fork of Webkit that provides device-specific app problems within the same versions of Android, which make releasing a quality product pretty difficult to guarantee.<p>And, of course, different screen dimensions are a problem. Android devices can range from variable aspect ratios with a minimum width of 240px all the way up to 1280px. Responsive design is a bit of magic that can be sprinkled on to help make things work better, but that's a substantial bit of effort relative to using the native UI tools for each individual platform.<p>edit: Another challenge with PhoneGap applications is targetting iOS. HIG without designer assistance is a challenge, and this particular gem in the iOS approval guidelines is somewhat damning: 2.12 Apps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected.",1368901532

But those who don't like the government investing in private enterprise probably aren't going to run out and buy a new Tesla just because the loan is being paid off. Net-net: perceptions of Tesla are not likely to change based on the loan repayment.<p>As for Tesla leaching off the government, it is important to note that $85m of Tesla's revenue in the last quarter came from regulatory credits. The vast majority, ~$67m, came from California's zero-emission program. All told, 15% of Tesla's revenue came from state and federal credits. Forget politics and perception: the impact of regulatory and tax credits on the company's finances and sales prospects over time is something any long-term Tesla investor should thoroughly understand.<p>2. Tesla is smart to raise capital now while money is still so cheap thanks to an almost unprecedented compression of risk premiums. The odds that capital will become more expensive in the next several years is certainly higher than the odds that it will become much cheaper.<p>But raising capital doesn't guarantee that capital will be deployed effectively. Celebrating the capital raise without acknowledging that there's execution risk is like celebrating a championship before the season has even started.<p>3. Elon Musk's obvious confidence in Tesla is a good thing, but you should not oversimplify the details of his stock purchases.

Raising capital for companies is one of the things that firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley do.<p>As for Morgan Stanley analysts taking a positive view on Tesla's prospects, consider that in July 2008, Morgan Stanley was advising clients to buy Lehman Brothers stock because ""we think near-term risk of incremental write-downs is balanced by solid liquidity and capital footing.""<p>Tesla may or may not be successful long-term, and its stock may or may not be a good investment at current prices, but I think your analysis here is akin to looking at the exterior of the vehicle without examining what's under the hood.",1368901518

5729788,comment,5728422,5729111,4,0,zackmorris,,,"Learning objc isn't too bad but it introduced a lot of (in my mind) unnecessary complexity because now you have two code paths (message passing vs. ordinary functions).  It's quite a verbose language so you have to declare member variables several times, and ARC has drawbacks over garbage collection so it's not always clear when something should be declared strong or weak, making it nearly impossible to prove that an app is free of leaks in low memory conditions.  Apple's iOS frameworks have a lot of trouble with inheritance, so you might have code that works with regular buttons but can't work with toolbar buttons for example, because they don't share a root class.  So I generally find iOS development to be remarkably complex and tedious for even the simplest GUI elements, especially if you are trying to do something beyond the vanilla layouts that Apple has in mind.  You also really can't develop for iOS without Stack Overflow, which to me is a red flag for any API.  Xcode has numerous bugs, especially with XML, so you may find that some change you made to a .xib file is not revertible because of a caching issue, and when you examine the XML you see that something was named slightly differently, so you have to be diligent with your version control and snapshots.  Apple is unable or unwilling to acknowledge many of these problems, much less solve them, so I constantly fight against issues that I thought would have been fixed by iOS 6.  I think out of every API I've learned, iOS is the hardest, not because of conceptual problems (their threading system is actually fairly good) but because of poor implementation choices where Apple omitted something for political reasons so you have to reinvent the wheel.  What we really need is a cross platform middleware that provides a consistent event system and API like win32 for all platforms, and then someone could write language hooks for that in javascript, lua, ruby, whatever.  Without that middle layer, it's too constraining to work with pure html5 IMHO.  I've only touched the tip of the iceberg here - there are so many hurdles to even getting an app published natively that I think making a cross platform app is still an open problem.",1368901115

So I'm trying to incorporate ""gentleness"" and humor into how I promote the causes I care about and how I talk about these potentially very serious problems.  It seems to be much more  effective than bombast!",1368900238

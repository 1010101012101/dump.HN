6992179,comment,6990821,6991899,1,0,will_brown,,,"Your post is very helpful because of the examples.<p>Lets take the Disney example.  Lets assume the non-disney original Snow White had a Copyright and was not in the public domain. That does not mean Disney&#x27;s version violates the copyright, it is very likely there was enough change in Disney&#x27;s version from the original that Disney would not be found to infringe.<p>Pride and Prejudice with Zombies: Assuming the creator of Pride and Prejudice had a valid copyright, without being familiar with either work I can almost guarantee this would not be Copyright infringement because it would be valid under the satirical exemption to Copyright infringement.<p>The Clueless and West Side Story examples are more difficult because I am not familiar with the works and the verbiage &quot;inspired by&quot; &quot;based on&quot; is all I am going off of. But this was my whole point regarding the OP that there is an assumption of copyright infringement.  Just because a work is &quot;inspired by&quot; or &quot;based on&quot; does legally mean there is infringement.  These individual examples would need to be analyzed on a case by case basis to determine if they violate copyright law or not.<p>All I advocate for is extension of the term of a copyright not an expansion of the right itself.  In which case I would argue most of your examples would not rely on the underlying works being in the public domain, because they were changed enough to not constitute infringement as opposed to say a 1 on 1 copy of the original work.",1388516362

It&#x27;s a way of winning the monitor over to the company&#x27;s side.  Did Apple try this and fail?

6992166,comment,6990821,6991717,3,0,Spooky23,,,"> Why should I on the death of an author be able to reproduce their work and sell it? Why should that be the case after 28 years or 75 years after the death of the creator be able to take their work and profit from it?<p>Because information truly wants to be free, and should be. Copyright is a legal construct that exists to make it financially viable to create. Creation and innovation drives society forward.<p>> The chilling effect on work is not a result of the author, but the company who pays for the work that allows the author to work on the book for years. Why would a company give advance an author, spend money promoting/printing/distributing a book if they can not make royalties on it x years after the author dies?<p>They do already. There are 220,000 books published in the United States annually. What fraction will still be in print in a decade? 50 years? 100?<p>> That serves the purpose of Disney spending billions on theme parks to further develop the brand, to further invest in their brand, establish their brand all over the world which creates jobs fueling the global economy.<p>Letting works slide into the public domain doesn&#x27;t prevent that.

Simple questions on StackOverflow to the rescue!<p>As another example, I did a large project involving SVG in the early 2000&#x27;s and got to the point where I knew as much as there was to know about it.  I recently did a quick one-off project that utilized SVG, and I found that I&#x27;d retained the big conceptual ideas, such as the behavior of the coordinate system, the hierarchy of shapes, viewports, groups, etc., but I&#x27;d totally forgotten a huge laundry list of practical nitty-gritty things about actually making an SVG experience work.<p>In the Java example I was embarking on a large project, so I hit the books and re-taught myself to fish again, because it was quite worth my time investment to start from the fundamentals and work my way back up.  In the SVG example, I literally just wanted to do something in an afternoon, and I knew SVG could do it, and I wasn&#x27;t going to do any SVG work after that.  Hitting the books and teaching myself to fish in that scenario would have been a waste of time.  So I plowed through and was helped immensely by the simple-question simple-answer Stack Overflow scenario.<p>Then there&#x27;s a whole list of technologies that I really don&#x27;t have the brain-space to keep abreast of, but I still need to use.  For example I am not an expert at shell scripting, but on occasion I need to write one.  Back to Stack Overflow and the simple answers to simple questions.<p>Before Stack Overflow I wouldn&#x27;t have been in the dark--as a long-time Internet community member, I would have gone through the usual: find the right community with the most helpful people, hope the community has a search engine or is well indexed by Google, read through long lists of replies without a voting system or assessment of quality, rinse-repeat.  Stack Overflow speeds that process up immensely.",1388515939

I decided to make a book search engine that would aggregate reviews from different sources across the web and provide a high quality, clean interface to quickly see information about a book and links to buy it on Amazon. The problem my service solved is that the Amazon interface is extremely ugly, and while I&#x27;m sure it is fine tuned for maximum sales it is definitely highly lacking in aesthetics and is cluttered with a lot of garbage. My goal was to create the cleanest, most minimal but extremely useful book search engine.<p>In retrospect my service was breaking many TOS because of the way it worked. When someone entered a book title or author name it would utilize Amazon API&#x27;s to get information about relevant books that matched the query, then it would scrape book information from Amazon, Goodreads, Barnes and Nobles, and the New York Times sunday book review among other sources, then it would cache that scraped information in my own database for future reference.<p>I justified this to myself by thinking it was okay because I was remixing the information to generate my own summary pages that were cleaner and more useful, but the reality is that I was pretty much parasitizing these other services to build my own database.<p>At its peak my service had many GB&#x27;s of scraped data from other sites and was getting about 5000 searches a day which was netting me about $500-$700 a month from commission on Amazon referrals sales. But after I started getting some press coverage in The Next Web, etc all the services that I was utilizing started sending me cease and desist notices. People used my site because it was cleaner and nicer than Amazon but Amazon didn&#x27;t appreciate that I was scraping their content to build my own site so they cut off my API access and closed my Amazon Associate account.<p>In the end it was a wild six month ride in which I made a few thousand dollars but more importantly got tons of experience in coding a scalable site, and best of all I started getting a lot of job offers. At one point I was getting three or four job offers a month from different startups from the HN community.<p>Eventually I decided to settle down at one of them where I could continue developing my coding skills. Things turned out very well, and the ride of personal growth and discovery isn&#x27;t over for me yet. Every day I get to code interesting things for my current startup company and this time its a legitimate business that isn&#x27;t going to get shut down for stealing content.<p>Even though you probably feel very disappointed about having to shut down your service like I did when I had to shut down mine, you can be confident that with your skills things will turn out just fine for you, and a lot of interesting startup companies will probably be eager to employ you.",1388515156

You see, many people think about the terrible pain and suffering the US experienced about a century ago when the economy and law were largely unregulated and unenforced. Much of the country became quickly enslaved to a small group of individuals; terrible exploitation and rampant poverty ensued. It was through a lot of hard work that Americans were able to place government regulation to free themselves from the tyranny of the robber barons. So when many people today hear the words &quot;without external central entity and enforcement&quot; the horrors of the gilded age flash before their eyes.<p>Also, your ideas about an AI-directed or general-consensus utopia are nice but naive. People don&#x27;t usually agree on what utility function you&#x27;d want to maximize, as there is no &quot;right way&quot; for a lot of things that matter to people. Would your Bitcoinish utopia allow late-term abortions? Or school prayer? Or same-sex marriage?

The trouble is that there are a <i>lot</i> of newbies, many of whom don&#x27;t take time either to read the &quot;about&quot; and &quot;how to ask good questions&quot; advice which the sites make prominently available for new users, or to characterize their problem in sufficient detail to make it solvable, or to search for the trivially obvious answer to whatever question they&#x27;re asking.<p>Once you&#x27;ve seen enough of this sort of thing -- and, again, especially on the highly popular sites there is a <i>lot</i> of it -- there&#x27;s a certain fatigue which sets in; you get jaded, I suppose, and that seems from what I&#x27;ve seen to be the proximate cause for newbie questions getting downvoted to oblivion or flagged for closure without anyone taking a moment to advise the asker on what he should&#x27;ve done differently.<p>Is this ideal? Of course not; in fact, it&#x27;s not even close, and I say that as someone who has considerable experience with the phenomenon so described. But Stack Exchange sites are moderated by volunteers, and you can&#x27;t issue ukazes to volunteers without a significant risk of losing them -- after all, if you make them not want to do what they do, they&#x27;ll just stop doing it.<p>In any case, just as a community can be judged by its attitude toward newbies, so can those newbies be judged by their attitude toward the community in which they attempt to participate. As in any other such case, it is entirely reasonable for those who have invested time and effort into Stack Exchange sites to expect that new users will deport themselves with respect for the rules and mores of the community.<p>With regard to giving the ability to comment to new and unregistered users, there&#x27;s a problem similar to that of low-quality newbie questions; so to broaden the provision of commenting privilege would produce an instant and enduring deluge of spam. You <i>really</i> can&#x27;t expect volunteers to handle sewage disposal, especially when the sewage is deep enough to require hip waders. Again, this is not ideal, but it is a consequence of the Stack Exchange model&#x27;s basic assumptions, and I&#x27;d have to say that model has acquitted itself well enough in practice to vindicate the claims made on its behalf.",1388514546

Stack Exchange serves the Java ecosystem very poorly however.<p>A lot of the frustration people have with Java is that they try to learn it from a task-oriented perspective,  and that really gets you in trouble if you work with Spring or Maven,  particularly on a big team.  If your first experience is with a 40-module Maven project that is all SNAPSHOT releases,  it takes two hours to do a complete build,  and there are just two people who understand maven vs 23 developers who get their answers a problem at a time from StackOverflow and who copy each others&#x27; bad solutions while adding more problems,  of course you hate Maven.<p>In the case of Maven the documentation sux and you need to read the source code and not be afraid to write plug-ins,  but Spring is not so mysterious if you take your tablet to the gym and read the manual cover to cover a few times.<p>There is no language that favors holistic thinking and punishes &quot;task-oriented&quot; thinking more than Java.

Use the boards to doodle cute animals with your kids when you&#x27;re away. Or you could use them to share your company&#x27;s sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, customer credit cards or HIPAA-protected medical data, and the like.<p>At DigitalWhiteboards, we&#x27;re very security conscious. We used to have our cleaners wipe down every board before assigning them to new customers. However, this took time and used up cleaning solution. As a result, we made the decision to not wipe down the boards when one customer stopped using it and the board was allocated to a different customer. However, when you no longer need our services, we provide a &quot;scrub&quot; option where you can pay for the time it takes for our cleaners to wipe down your whiteboard.<p>If you choose not to pay for this option, what is on your whiteboard will be visible to the next customer who gets it. We think this is a great default. If there&#x27;s ever a problem with your whiteboard (such as the robotic arm breaking, or the video camera goes on the fritz) we will of course give you another whiteboard to work on. And naturally, when the problem is fixed, we&#x27;ll let the next customer see your old board, even if you would have used scrub had you had the opportunity to do so.

You seriously limit the royalty rate you&#x27;re going to get this way, but you&#x27;re going to extend your reach and marketing ability. So it&#x27;s a balance, and you need to figure out whether reach or per-book royalties are more important. If you have a small audience and you know you can reach each and every reader yourself (maybe on Twitter or HN or Reddit), then self-publishing may be the way to go.<p>I chose Wiley, because the audience for my book is broader than most data science books (since it&#x27;s spreadsheet based), and I wanted to get it in front of your average BI analyst perusing at Barnes and Noble.<p>The big publisher also did a great job with layout, the book <i>feels</i> great with its matte finish, I had two paid tech editors, a regular editor, a project editor, and a bevy of proofreaders.

Exchanges take out trading fees and the market makers on the exchanges will want to see some profit as well (you will see this reflected in the bid/ask spread). The total cost for the transaction will be 2x the spread + exchange fees. People keep touting the 2.5% charge for using credit cards, but they don&#x27;t compare it to a similar value for bitcoin. It clearly is not 0%. Exchange fees alone are can be something like 0.5%. If we double that (two conversions, remember) that&#x27;s 1% just in exchange fees. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have good numbers for bitcoin / dollar spreads because I don&#x27;t watch that market very closely.<p>So we have 2.5% for credit cards and 1% + spread (unknown) for bitcoin.

Large group of people put financial rules into software and agreed that they are going to use these rules without external central entity and enforcement.<p>If this continue to roll, same might be applied to many other areas I believe.<p>It is just my random fantasy at this moment, but why we will need enforcement, if we will have guarantied income in bitcoins and laws system built same way as bitcoin (i.e. opensource and agreed to use by most people) and law enforcement as a function of guaranteed income amount....

A very typical fraud scenario (maybe the most common) is someone collecting payment for an item that they don&#x27;t actually possess. This would only be harder to deal with and correct if the payment were disbursed to an anonymous seller in bitcoins.",1388512926

6991809,comment,6986510,6990016,1,0,skybrian,,,"The difference is that if a server running HTTPS is hacked, the attacker can modify the JavaScript at will. With an app that&#x27;s signed offline, this isn&#x27;t possible; you could even redistribute it on an untrusted mirror.<p>Also, in theory, an independent auditor could rebuild the app from source and verify that the bits match, and do an independent audit of the source. So signed apps are more verifiable.<p>The trusted base for a signed app is (browser + app + app signer), not (browser + app + server), where the server might be a virtual machine in the cloud and you need to trust the virtual machine host provider too.<p>This doesn&#x27;t matter most of the time because you have to trust the server anyway, but in the case of someone wanting to encrypt something on the client that cannot be decrypted on the server, it does matter. Encrypting on the client is mostly pointless unless the client code is independent of the server, which requires it to be independently signed.<p>There is still a cert chain of course, but it&#x27;s a different one where the developer&#x27;s private key doesn&#x27;t get uploaded to the server.<p>Signed apps are fundamentally not how the web works. The argument here is that the web is basically broken for client-side encryption and the app store model is better for things like secure email or a bitcoin wallet.<p>But since most app store apps aren&#x27;t open source and the open source ones aren&#x27;t independently audited in practice, it&#x27;s not clear it&#x27;s a practical difference.",1388512827

You&#x27;re obviously taking a risk when you hand over the keys to your apartment to a stranger.  This is the same risk that landlords take when they lease the unit in the first place; hence why these blacklists exist: to minimize risk.  The difference is that the landlord is at least leasing what is his to lease. Renting your apartment on AirBnB is prohibited by just about every lease, and is flat-out illegal in NYC.  He broke the terms of his lease and the law to make hundreds of dollars a night, trusted a stranger that a website connected him with, and got busted.  He could try to sue the guy that threw the orgy, just like landlords can try to sue deadbeat tenants; but just like the landlords, he&#x27;ll probably get nowhere.

It may now go mainstream.<p>This is more of an issue for businesses than for individuals. Businesses get to choose how they obtain capital, and that decision is often driven by tax considerations. All the ways companies pay for capital - interest, dividends, and stock buybacks - should be taxed at the same rate.  Right now, there&#x27;s a huge tax bias in favor of debt. Borrowing for stock buybacks is a huge fraction of US corporate borrowing, and it&#x27;s driven by tax considerations. That&#x27;s effectively a very expensive subsidy program.<p>Eliminating the tax benefits of debt has systemic advantages. When a company financed by equity goes under, its stockholders suffer, but the potential loss is bounded. As we learned in 2008, debt-financed failures cascade. Much M&A, private equity, and hedge fund activity is fuelled by the tax advantages of equity to debt conversion. Eliminate those, and much unnecessary financial activity goes away. The hedge fund industry will scream, but now that it&#x27;s well known that hedge funds underperform the market while extracting huge fees, that&#x27;s no big loss.<p>This change shouldn&#x27;t affect startup companies. Those are almost always equity funded. Nobody loans to a startup that will probably fail. (There are some startups with complex debt/equity/warrant deals which exist to get the tax benefits of debt with the potential upside of equity. That&#x27;s a tax gimmick, not lending.)<p>The overall effect is conservative. By removing a Government policy which distorts markets, we move back to a system where businesses are primarily equity-funded. It returns companies to their historical role as payers of dividends.<p>It&#x27;s a good time for this change to business financing. Interest rates are very low, so the tax impact is also low.",1432877945

Specifically it introduces the concept of a multi-leaf collimator which serves as the main collimating device in modern radiotherapy. The other degree of freedom is the angle of the gantry you see rotating around the patient.<p>Typically for every gantry angle, the treatment planning software would split up an open field (no collimation) into a bunch of 1x1 cm^2 &quot;beamlets&quot; and would simulate what kind of dose distribution you would get inside the patient from each beamlet (you turn the patient CT into a big 3D grid of voxels to simulate dose in).<p>You then throw all those dose distributions into an optimiser, and you do what&#x27;s called a fluence map optimisation which gives you the amount of radiation you want to deliver out of each beamlet. This is the optimisation step I described earlier where the cost function is basically a square difference between the dose in each organ from a given set of beamlet weights and what you want the dose to actually be. Healthy tissue is the limiting factor so you give as much as you can to the tumour while making sure that less than X% of the volume of a nearby organ gets more than Y units of radiation. There&#x27;s a final step at the end that turns the fluence maps into actual deliverable apertures shaped by the multi leaf collimator.<p>There&#x27;s a huge amount of work that goes into the simulation aspect. You can&#x27;t just model the radiation beam as pure light sources that attenuate in the body via some exponential decay because the high energy photons scatter off electrons which themselves scatter around while depositing energy (radiation dose) away from the point of interaction. The gold standard is Monte Carlo simulations (which is my area of research) since you can model the actual physics of particle transport but in practice most clinics will use a faster engine to generate dose distributions. The faster engines typically superpose a primary component (a pure exponential decay) convolved with a kernel representing the energy that gets deposited away from the point of interaction.<p>That&#x27;s probably way more information than you wanted ;)",1432877614

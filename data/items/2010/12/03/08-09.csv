That's not what the OP was saying: they said they didn't know how to create a linked list from scratch, whether they were writing on a whiteboard, a computer or with a crayon on the back of a 4000 year old cuneiform tablet from Mesopotamia.<p>Is it that you just don't like the kind of problems that are being asked (fundamental computer science) and would rather see more real-world problems? Or do you genuinely think the wide, stubby pen and vertical orientation impairs some people's coding ability? Just to note, I can see the performance aspect of the whiteboard is stressful, but coding on a machine with everyone looking at you is stressful too.",1291366601

You might find them kind of advanced right now:<p>* Chapter 3 of <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a> -- also chapters 1 and 2.<p>* _Abstraction and Specification in Program Development_, on design by contract. There's a newer book by the same authors, _Program Development in Java_, but Norman Ramsey says it's not as good. (I've only read the older one.) By Liskov & Guttag. Focuses on abstract datatypes rather than OOP classic. Bertrand Meyer's _Object-Oriented Software Construction_ covers much of the same material, but not as well to my taste in the bits I dipped into.<p>* Also, _Smalltalk-80: The Language and Its Implementation_ at <a href=""http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/64"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/64</a> -- this might be more basic than the above two. The ideas were old to me by the time I got to it, so I don't know how well it'd work for a novice.<p>* I've seen _A Little Smalltalk_ recommended as an intro to OO and it looks plausible: <a href=""http://www.littlesmalltalk.org/index.php?page=the-book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.littlesmalltalk.org/index.php?page=the-book</a> -- I haven't read it myself.",1291366475

The point was (among others) that languages with a good ""market position"" attracts all kind of programmers, from challenged to geek. On the other side you have languages who attract more geeks because the i-have-to-pay-my-mortgage-which-language-should-i-learn group is underrepresented.

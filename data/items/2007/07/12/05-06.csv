Or next week. Or next month.""<p>\nI don't know when you throw in the towel on your own baby, but it certainly seem questionable to <i>join</i> a startup that's been in crunch mode for 3yrs and still can't make payroll.\n",1184219769

33792,comment,33738,33738,0,0,mxh,,,"This may be a silly question, but it's something that's bothered me ever since Scribd launched:  How do you handle all the file format conversions?<p>It seems to be that you couldn't be wrangling all those formats yourself, as many are undocumented, and/or hideously complex, and you've got to do a lot more work than simply reading the files, and not much time to do it.  So, are there some off-the-shelf components to do this work (with reasonable license terms), or is the problem easier than it seems?<p>I'm most interested in the MSFT formats, which seem the trickiest.",1184219535

Although I think Costco can do a few things to bring their image up to speed (the logo is pretty hideous, the marketing materials are pretty ugly and cliche), this article really makes me respect the company and the CEO.<p>Why can't all companies work like this?<p>\n",1184218729

33785,comment,33660,33663,0,0,staunch,,,"I live in Tokyo and don't think it's very different from the US. The ATMs have amazing transfer features, like looking up a friend's account to send him money. I pay for a lot of things, like rent, through cashless transfers at an ATM. I pay cash at the convenience store for my utilities, which I paid by check in the US.<p>It's well known that many older Japanese people keep huge sums of cash savings in their houses. There are occasionally almost comical stories in the newspaper about houses getting broken into and the thieves walking out with obscene amounts of money.<p>I'm a huge fan of cash in general. I do value seeing my money and hate the idea of all my transactions being logged. I totally agree with the premise of the article, I've been doing this for years.\n",1184217495

Many times I open files to try stuff out, and I DO NOT want anything saved.

Sure, you can tell someone how to clone, branch, commit and push in 20 minutes, but that's not really understanding.<p>For example, last month I was at a meetup, and had to help someone who was contributing to an open-source project. She had been following the project's instructions on using git, but was stuck. It turned out that she had hit a snag in the middle of a multi-commit patch that was applied with ""git am"" and as a result, her repository was in an intermediate state and the usual commit, add, reset etc. commands weren't working. I helped her back out to a clean state, but it took me several minutes of scouring documentation to do it, and I consider myself proficient with git. If I hadn't been there, I expect she would have given up on the whole thing, and all because git has some bizarre interactive processes that leave your repository unusable while in progress.<p>I think it's undeniable that git is unfriendly and obtuse at times, and the people who think otherwise are just examining it too close. They have mastered it, they see all of the justifications for each quirk, and because of that they can't see the big picture, which is that it is extraordinarily difficult for a new programmer to pick it up and be proficient.",1344174502

Do you really want to put your blood, sweat, and tears into developing the 1000th photo sharing service?  Find a company that is pursing something unique and interesting and that seems like it has real business potential.<p>Make sure the founders / executive team are on the same page.  Make sure they have the same vision about what they are looking for in a new employee.  If you pick up on signs that they are not quite in unison then your time working at their company will probably not be happy.<p>Ask yourself what is so special about the founders.  What special skills or knowledge do they bring to the table that will crush the competition?  If you don't think they have an edge then don't join their team.  Try to find founders with some type of deep domain expertise.<p>As an employee you are investing your time in a company.  Ask yourself if you want to work day in and day out with the people who are interviewing you.  If you get a bad personality vibe from the people you're talking with then don't join.  All personal conflicts will get blown up in the pressure cooker startup atmosphere.<p>Take this into consideration: remember that all that glitters is not gold.  The odds of success are decidedly not in your favor at a startup.  Startups are the trendy thing to do (especially here on HN) but know that they have their downsides just like any other company.

I've found that it's very powerful, and that most things that you want to do with it are possible, but not always as easy as it could be.<p>I'm working on a collaborative project with several inexperienced developers using various editors and operating systems, and dealing with line endings has been a serious time sink. The first step was ""* text=auto"" in a .gitattributes file to override everyone's local settings, as some had used custom settings when they installed Git.<p>Apparently the developers of Git decided to not support \r as a line ending, which ended up causing headaches for us because some legacy programs still use it. Several times, someone committed changes to a file where \r\n line endings had been replaced with just \r, for whatever reason. To Git, they had just deleted the entire file and replaced it with one long line.

Those thrusters were expressly designed (that is, compromised) to produce as little disturbance of the landing site as possible. The only thing Curiosity is doing that is really new is the sky crane.

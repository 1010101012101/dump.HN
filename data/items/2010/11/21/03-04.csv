1926252,comment,1925253,1925253,0,0,dpatru,,,"Our ""education"" model is fundamentally broken. It's based on the idea that we need to warehouse kids in institutions modeled on 18th century factories so that they can do well on ""standardized"" tests. Certainly Bill Gates did not obtain his education this way. He basically educated himself by following his passion from an early age. He working in his field of choice at the age of 15. By 20 he had founded Microsoft.<p>""School"" for Bill Gates was his educated home environment, the block of computer time he could use in 8th grade, the Computer Center Corporation where he worked while in high school, and his projects with Paul Allen as a teenager. It was the unstructured resources that were around him.<p>Not every kid is a Bill Gates. Most probably need less formal instruction because they do not need as much abstract knowledge.<p>Schools as they exist today should be abolished and the teachers and other staff that work in them should be taken off the public payrolls and allowed to take useful jobs in the private sector.<p>Schools, to the extent that they exist at all, should be more like graduate study where an advisor suggests resources for further study. These advisors could be unpaid volunteers. People with successful careers in areas of that the student is interested in who interact with the student intermittently perhaps over the internet.<p>The bulk of kids' time should be spent in projects or actual work, apprentice-style, in an area of their interest. Instead of being grouped together in dysfunctional groups of their own kind, young people should be distributed in the economy, working with and under the supervision of competent adults in the various fields.",1290311551

1926239,comment,1924538,1924538,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Those questions and this thread blew me away:  I'm way behind on both of them.<p>Yes some years ago for maybe a few hours I understood Kerberos and RSA and using RSA to 'sign' a document.  And once for about an hour I understood the keys, handshaking, etc. of Microsoft domain servers, Active Directory, or whatever.  But I've never since had any occasion to revisit those ideas or any deeper ideas.<p>Gee, when I took abstract algebra, I got enough number theory to understand and prove Fermat's little theorem, etc., but I've never had to use it.  Maybe if I take some of the old source code I have for PGP and want to revise it, then I would look at such number theory again, but I likely shouldn't be working with the internals of something like PGP.<p>Gee, once I read<p>David J. Marchette, 'Computer Intrusion Detection:  A Statistical Viewpoint', ISBN 0-387-95281-0, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001.<p>and understood that well enough, but I'm still nearly clueless about that article and this thread.<p>Maybe I should know more:  I'm building a Web site that I hope will be popular.  So I'll have to run a 'server farm' of the necessary size and manage the network in the farm and the connection to the Internet.  So, again, maybe I should know more.<p>Maybe some of you guys could post some more on this thread and get me, and people with similar ignorance, partly caught up.<p>So, my first broad question would be, in considering my computer and network security, will I really have to work at the relatively low level of those question?  E.g., I know next to nothing about SSH, but I will make use of it via software from others.  Do I really need to understand SSH at the level of the packets, handshaking, keys, etc.?  If I was curious, would thirty minutes with some Wikipedia article be enough?  Would I be able to get enough low level access even to use such details?  Is it enough and about all I can do just to leave the details and implementation of SSH to others?  E.g., I just spent 12 hours today reading about SQL Server logins, users, Windows authentication, permissions, roles, schemata, etc., but again I just get to use these things as a part-time DBA and don't get to see or work with the details.  Similarly for other important parts of network security?<p>Second, is it really true that commonly information security professionals in US companies need to know and work with such details?  E.g., when the world changes over to IPv6, will I have to know the details or will I just leave the details to the people who write the code and build the hardware?<p>I can understand that Cisco, Juniper, Microsoft, developers of Linux, and intrusion prevention device designers need to understand Ethernet and TCP/IP at all levels, but do I?<p>Net, how much detail is needed, and what is it actually used for?",1290311336

1926221,comment,1925884,1926169,0,0,maxharris,,,"""A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life means the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.)<p>The concept of a “right” pertains only to action-specifically, to freedom of action. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference by other men.<p>Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive—of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on them except of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html</a>",1290310869

The latter will by definition find something easier to do, and it is greatly in society's interest that they do so.<p>Another advantage of this plan is that the degree of onerousness (how many years you have to put in, what you get paid, and so on) could be tested empirically.<p>ps: I like several of your other comments in this thread.

A key to good meditation is not worrying if you can't always clear your mind or random thoughts occur. I live in the mountains in Central Arizona, so short 20 minute walks by myself on the trails behind my house also form what I call walking meditation. I also find sitting outside for 5 minutes, again not thinking directly about work, helps me get a good perspective on whatever I am doing that day.<p>When I lived in San Diego I had a window office looking out over La Jolla Cove and I found a few times a day using 10 minutes with my door shut, looking at the ocean helped.<p>The subconscious mind is a powerful problem solver.

1926113,comment,1925454,1925454,0,0,dibarra,,,"I deal with this in my day job as well. Many datacenters will have mitigation appliances such as Arbor Peakflow, Cisco Guards, IntruGuard, etc. For attacks that are throwing garbage to unused ports, you can block these fairly effectively by having your datacenter block these ports at the router. Just ask your datacenter's support for a service such as this, usually their SLA specifies a time limit for how long your site may consume mitigation services for free. Your datacenter will probably start nulling your IP at around 1gbps inbound (varies, might be lower)<p>Some DDoS's are easy to block via iptables- attackers who aren't very clever will have the same UA on all of their bots, and they are easy to block via a combination of tailing your domlogs, and adding bad ips to an iptables listing. Many don't set a user agent, making it much easier.<p>Floods that consist of holding open http server connections for long periods of time can be combated by throwing MaxClients to something large (about 5000) and setting keepalive to something low, like around 5 seconds (if you're using Apache, similar probably holds true for other http servers).<p>You can usually use string blocking via iptables, but these will still hold the connection open until the client times out, and you might have to resort to the above in conjunction (raise MaxClients, etc.). Usually, I try to mitigate via IP addresses before string blocking.<p>Rarely will I see an attack that will require a nullroute upstream. If you're worried about those, you will need to seek professional services. In most cases, you can mitigate at the server level easily. Also, ngrep is your friend.",1290308467

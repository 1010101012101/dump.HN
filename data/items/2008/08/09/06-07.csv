271497,comment,271437,271467,0,0,staunch,,,"I use a 15.4"" Dell Latitude D830 @ 1920x1200 and wouldn't trade it for any other laptop made. I'd say 1920x1200 is about my limit for a 15"" LCD, but if anyone makes a 17"" laptop that goes higher I'll be first in line. It's amazed me for years how under appreciated the value of high resolution is.",1218264970
271496,comment,271325,271414,0,0,litewulf,,,"I had a rather amusing conversation with my coworker today about this. I think that companies should not collect that kind of data, despite the benefit in terms of improved products (personalized search, ads that don't suck, whatever), whereas his basic attitude was ""I'm not doing anything illegal, they're not doing anything illegal, so why not?""<p>While I would not mind being shown ads I care about, I worry about the cost. I don't want companies to be able to share detailed click trails and be able to produce in depth biographies because of the potential for abuse, be it governmental, corporate or ""hm I wonder what I can find out about that girl I met yesterday"".<p>PS: as an addendum, I know people with Google log access, and while it's less scary than it sounds, I know there are ""tons"" of people with such access... and counterparts at other companies. I don't know if I can trust <i>all</i> those people with knowing when I get funny rashes or whatever.",1218264810

Had to fidget with some packages and the kernel a little to get it all going smoothly. Not too bad.<p>What sold me on it was the ergonomics (keyboard's perfectly usable, 10.2"" screen) and the portability (5 hours of battery with continuous use; I let it sleep when I wasn't using it and went all day on a single charge).<p>The goal was to have the laptop on me at all times so I can get work done anywhere.",1218263858

271473,comment,271044,271375,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Well if i can get cygwin to work properly i get a UNIX++(an octopus made by...). As for linux, the only hardware problems I've had was with my printer, and since the only non-windows drivers were 2 RPM's i doubt that mac OS X would magically solve that problem.<p>And here is my really awesome opinion, i understand all the hype around OS X, its new, its cool, and it gets you laid(well, that youtube video said so, so it must be true). Lets just forget about the company logo that stays on you laptop. Is their really any  real advantage that macs have to linux? One would say better graphic design. My KDE desktop looks pretty enough, i've spent years in xp, so KDE looks great to me. Next is usability. Well, after i tweak my KDE desktop a little i get all the usability i need, i do all the things that i want to do. OK what else does OS X have that linux doesn't? It has better apps. OK, that might be true. I don't know how many apps OS X has, but if they are close to 16000, how do you expect them all to be as good, as the best. windows has the same problem, too many apps, when  OS X gets popular enough we will see a big amount of bad apps. So, what do we see? I don't need a mac, linux is good enough. OK, is this the blub OS paradox?",1218262377

271467,comment,271437,271437,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I find one of the most important things is screen space.  And I don't mean a gigantic 17"" screen; I mean DPI.  I have a 15.4"" laptop with a 1680x1050 screen; this gives me room to work.  I've seen laptops the same size with 1280x800 screens; I don't know how anyone could do much of anything on those.<p>Don't get anything too heavy.  Mine's just over 6 pounds, and that's already pushing it.<p>Finally, don't worry about hard disk space; if you need lots, just grab an external drive; they're cheap these days.",1218261655

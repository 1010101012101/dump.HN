In many cases this is a code smell that indicates a section that was not completely thought out.<p>The next step with an invalid cast exception or a type check is to take action and do something about it.  When faced with an exception there can be more ambiguity about it's source especially when there are many lines in the try block or if you are calling into other libraries.<p>What if there is some code in the save method that throws the exception for type casting and the invalid cast exception assumes that the source is the base class problem?

It's an essential part, to me, of the human experience.<p>That said, when I was younger I didn't always treat them with the respect they deserve, and it's difficult to determine in retrospect the effects they've had on my life - in part because I was still not yet fully formed when I began. I don't regret the path I've taken, but in retrospect it seems a fluke that I've arrived where I am with my sanity (arguably) intact; or even that I've arrived at this age at all.<p>To me, these are incredibly powerful tools, with amazing potential for both creation and destruction - but the infrastructure to support their responsible use didn't evolve at a pace to match their sudden explosion into  mainstream awareness in the 60's, and the results were terrifying to many; alcohol can be an amazingly destructive drug, but societies have had thousands of years to grow comfortable with its effects, and to learn to mitigate its worst excesses.<p>As a result of this (perhaps rightly deserved) fear and confusion, we've collectively overreacted, not only banning them outright, but elevating their status to one of our most fiercely prosecuted taboos. I sincerely hope that this will change at some point, and that it will coincide with an evolution of the knowledge and wisdom required to use them responsibly.<p>To me it's evident that there are strong positive outcomes to be gained, from personal and artistic growth to effective treatment for psychiatric afflictions - but more than any other substances I know of, these drugs are chameleons that can change form entirely in response to one's approach to them. They rarely reward foolishness or irresponsibility.<p>Now, as ever, cultists are everywhere; I put my trust in science.

2499012,comment,2497360,2497360,6,0,bliss,,,"My tuppence: I was an average student, perhaps an underachiever - I was the youngest in my class...  Anyway around about the closing years of high school I discovered the recreational joy of LSD, which I took despite superman comics warning me of the dangers.  For a while I dropped out (3 years) and enjoyed a life that was devoid of computers (until that point I had spent all my time on 8bit then 16bit computers, leading up to an 8086 pc).  I lived in a bedsit and had no outlook or any desire to ""get a life"".  At some point during an acid trip, I found myself alone and spent a long time in introspection about where I was and where I would like to be.  Long story short, fast forward 20 years, I'm married with a beautiful daughter, a great senior technical job with a very public FTSE 100 media company, a couple of irons in the fire with personal software projects I'm writing (in fact, I'm actually procrastinating here, I should be coding!) and a generally great life.  If I had continued on my ""wastrel"" route those years ago, my life wouldn't have been as rosy (though perhaps less stressful).  I attribute my conversion from waster to nerd entirely to my experiences with LSD.  I thoroughly recommend it to others (though I will caution that I have seen downsides in some of my comrades, not deaths you understand, but longer lead-times to achieving their goals).  This article (though lacking in specifics) does resonate very strongly with my life experience.  Final question (to myself) would I use LSD again?  Answer... not sure, I've done a whole lot of living in the last 20 years, not sure I want to reprogram the grey matter at this stage - maybe again in 10 years...",1304111531

Salary level in general in the US is much higher than in Finland. But for teachers, the difference is smaller.<p>In general, with high progressive taxation, income is much more equal between sectors. The job market is just different. Things like shorter hours and longer vacations also become larger perks.<p>The society also is just not as money centered, for example status is derived more from other things. Finns are also quite jealous and shy, meaning people don&#x27;t tend to exhibit it if they are wealthy. Some people from other cultures might feel it as a sort of repressive &quot;keep your head down&quot; attitude. It is anathema to try to raise yourself above others in any way. In total it makes things like luxury cars or flashy villas much less desirable here - they would be boorish. So what is your motivation for a higher pay? You won&#x27;t use it for status or luxury. Education for your children is free anyway. Most people use it for apartments in slightly better locations.",1379494516

...but if Apple doesnt offer a larger display option soon then I believe it will lose some users not because of cross shopping, but out of frustration.
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t get this huge screen trend for phones. That&#x27;s not a smart move from an ergonomics perspective. Almost person person that has a phone with a big screen has to use both hands to comfortably use the phone, one to touch and the other to hold.<p>One would argue that more pixels == more content. But that&#x27;s not an issue with iPhone 5 even though was with previous models. I mean, not an issue if you don&#x27;t have ads taking up your precious pixels. And that is easily solvable by paying for your content and apps which has other benefits too.<p>Anyway, I feel the iPhone 5 screen size is perfect. And I still have one hand free to do whatever I want. I think more pixels are not more useful than a hand.

You don&#x27;t have to use different commands to add and grow disks and the partitions upon those disks.  Your filesystem knows about what it&#x27;s living on and stores data accordingly.  ZFS has more advanced file system properties, like sending snapshots, even of block devices.  BTRFS is still working on feature parity with this.  ZFS is much more stable than other FS with similar features.<p>The big disadvantage is the memory and CPU requirement.  If your server has plenty of memory and CPU, I&#x27;d use ZFS.

6404165,comment,6403089,6403921,5,0,pja,,,"Yes, the biggest boost to x86 performance in the move to 64 bit came mostly because they doubled the number of regsiters available to what was previously a very register poor ISA.<p>The ARM ISA has different legacy issues: the design makes it much more expensive than it otherwise would be to pipeline the CPU in order to get decent performance. The ISA was designed for an in-order CPU: at the time pipelining was something that mainframe / workstation class CPUs did. (ARM was designed in the very early 80s; Intel released a pipelined CPU in 1989 - the 486, and then only for simple instructions.)<p>For instance, every ARM32 assembly instruction has a bunch of condition codes which determine whether to execute the instruction depending on the state of the status bits in the program counter. You can also determine whether a given instruction will set the relevant status bits in the processor. This means you can do nice things like encode an if (R2 < 0) then (Add 1 to R3) else (Add 1 to R4) in just three instructions: one for the test, an instruction if the relevant flag is set & a second instruction to run if it&#x27;s not set. No branches! You can also branch on any or all of the condition flags. This makes for very compact code. The trouble is that it&#x27;s hell to pipeline because you have to keep track of all the possible states of the status bits and follow all the possible branch paths that result, whilst keeping track of all the dependencies.<p>They&#x27;ve also done things like simplify the exception handling so that the CPU needs fewer shadow registers, which again reduces power requirements.",1379492814

There are lots of times when moving some arbitrary number is rewarded, and we know that humans respond to incentives.  It&#x27;s perfectly logical, and even the best strategy in some situations.<p>People who pull tactical games like this might be able to get by, or do well, or become captains of dying industries, but fundamentally we can probably agree they are assholes.  Plenty go along because they are playing the junior edition same game with the junior edition of the same strategy. When there isn&#x27;t a risk of repercussions, or when they feel like they have a chance to gain credibility, or whatever motivations big smart apes really act out of, they loudly laugh at and mock the asshole; because of the hurt they feel at wasting the part of their life that was spent doing something so obviously worthless, and because of the shame and regret of compromising themselves, and because it&#x27;s a good move.<p>Some people have real problems.  Some people don&#x27;t get enough food to eat.  Someone could say that it&#x27;s a form of privilege to have problems like &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in my job&quot;.  It almost certainly is.<p>Somewhere in some country where people die of things that people just don&#x27;t die of other places, there are people officially working on things, and money being spent, all kinds of activity done because someone feels like that is their best strategy, and the people involved know it&#x27;s stupid and pointless and a waste, and they know there are people suffering that could suffer less.<p>It&#x27;s easy to play along.  It&#x27;s easy to play a strategy that maximizes personal outcomes.  In fact, the people at the top almost certainly got there by playing such a strategy.  It seems likely that it&#x27;s an evolutionarily stable strategy, despite the implication that a lot more suffering is going to happen.",1379492811

I did stuff like tearing down desktop boxes for repair, and building install images (although I doubt these ever got used, security there was pretty tight.)<p>One day, everyone in the department trooped over to a lecture theatre, which was full up with all kinds of staff, doctors, support staff etc. It was about the newly conceived NHS IT project, which was at this stage just a patient records system. It was the slickest presentation I&#x27;d ever seen, delivered by a similarly slick government guy, who was on tour, preaching the good word about how amazing this new system was going to be. Even to me as a child, it was clear that he was not entirely to be trusted, mainly because he had obviously not made his own powerpoint. I remember a lot of stuff about &quot;preferred partners,&quot; and thinking it was all very fishy indeed.<p>Afterwards, we in IT adjourned to our own meeting room, to exchange views. There was universal despair. Foreheads met table with some force. The meeting basically consisted of going round the circle, each battle-hardened techie sharing their particular view of why this would never work. &quot;I once built a database of every vauxhall car in europe, with all their service records centralised. That was a fraction of the size of this, and it was still a fucking nightmare, even though the people designing it and the people building it were the same people, and we had absolute technological discretion.&quot; And so on.<p>The pretty much universal consensus was that this would be a disaster, a plague on all their lives for decades to come, for some, the rest of their careers. I credit this moment with warning me off corporate computing forever. Now I write ruby in a place where I am not obligated to wear shoes. Thanks NHS!<p>EDIT: as a part of my time there I also went to the records department, which was like a giant library with shelves up to the ceiling and moving ladders. On these shelves were the paper patient files, big fat green folders full of assorted documents bound together with those treasury tag things. This was what the slick guy wanted Fujitsu and friends to replace.<p>I saw the little green records request slips that came into the archive department. Doctors wrote them out when they wanted someone&#x27;s file. If the file had already been given out to someone else, the archivist would find a slip of paper in it&#x27;s place on the shelf, detailing it&#x27;s whereabouts. They would cross reference various numbers, and then send the request slip on to the noted location of the file. When it got there it was quite possible that the file would no longer be at that location, having been given onwards to someone else. Doctors were under no obligation to return the files when they were finished with them, they could give them directly to the next person who needed them. However, they would have to write and hold on to a slip detailing where it had gone. In this way, the little green slips formed a linked list, sometimes 5 levels deep. There was much beeping of barcode scanners: they had built an in house computerised system for tracking the locations of the paper files.<p>I asked, and apparently the files never got lost. The archivists enforced this regime with a fascistic level of seriousness and intensity. Any doctor who didn&#x27;t fill out the green forms correctly would face their wrath, and they didn&#x27;t do this because they knew that if the system wasn&#x27;t adhered to then they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the patient records they needed. The doctors had built the time-delay for file retrieval into their procedures, and everything ran smoothly around it.<p>This taught me ultimate respect for paper, and the folly of just throwing away a system which highly skilled people have built up over decades, even if you think your whizz-bang technology will be better.",1379492669

Maybe you have latency limits you need to work within.<p>Unless you have lots and lots of time to spend micro-optimizing everything, you&#x27;ll get better performance writing in Haskell.<p>> Maybe there are good C libraries that solve your problem<p>Maybe, but most of the original post is about how lacking the library ecosystem is. I can well believe that you might have some useful domain-specific libraries for the backend, but that calls for writing a backend service in C (and using something like thrift to call it), not &quot;web programming in C&quot;.<p>> Maybe you just want to learn C better.<p>If you try and learn on a fake problem you&#x27;ll pervert your learning. Web development is not amenable to idiomatic C (Cello is a good example - it&#x27;s not appropriate to the sort of problems C <i>is</i> appropriate for, and if you learn C based on using Cello it will not make you a good C programmer).",1379492278

3) Issue RFQs and proposals to competitive tenderers with the clear understanding that there will be no sole supplier

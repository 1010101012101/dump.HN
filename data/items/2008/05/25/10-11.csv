My fist thought was that the simple-English for autodidactic here would be ""self-taught"", being aware of unnecessary abstractions, though the subtler meaning is closer to ""someone who will teach themselves"".<p>Simply saying ""self-taught"" wouldn't have had the right connotation: instead of ""clever and driven"", it would have been, ""but what have they missed?"" and we would have missed out on this interesting off-topic sub-thread!",1211712902

I think in English we'd just accept any and all alternative meanings and let context sort it out, who's up for some creative reading?",1211712275

This determination to leave a legacy can often be just as conceited. Its not enough to be rich, people want to have a stamp on history like the Rockefellers or Carnegies.<p>Donating to a museum may seem altruistic but don't be so foolish, you can never really know people's true motivations.",1211711085

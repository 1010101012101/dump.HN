But the simple fact is that you need to do at least one of two things to avoid RSI:<p>Stop stressing your poor wrists and hands.\nVary it up.<p>Stop stressing your poor wrists and hands:\nIf you take your hands off of your damned keyboard when you're not using it, and use your brain instead for a bit, you will not stress your hands. You can reduce stress to your hands by getting special keyboards, varying your sitting height, adding padding, etc. But just remove your hands from the keyboard, and there is no repetitive stress from keeping your fingers hanging in the air.<p>Vary it up:\nDon't keep a static posture for too long. Doing exercise, etc, will strengthen your core and your arms, or whatever, but actually having something different going on as far as your body kinematics throughout the day is probably better.  Drape a leg over that armrest.  Squat. Lean back. Lean forward.  Type with one hand.  Humans are not meant to be statues.<p>And, the unspoken third rule:\nIf you are experiencing RSI, you need to ramp it down or take a vacation.  RSI gets worse over time. You can treat inflammation with drugs in the short term, and you can point to mental components if you like, but the first two points don't mean very much if you don't give yourself time to heal, which means not hovering over a keyboard for an extended period of time.",1346895362

I have a problem of having lots of browser tabs and not wanting to close any of them when I want to shut down my mac. Are you having this problem too? Would you use a browser extension/website that allows you to save your browser session and recover it on any computer/browser anytime?<p>Thanks in advance for the feedback.",1346893515

I'm working on AI for Ambition (using vanilla neural nets and backprop, to start). I'm not actually creating an ""intelligence"". I'm creating something good enough to pose a challenge (e.g. not make obvious stupid plays that ruin the feel). Eventually, I'd like to have agents that give me more understanding of the underlying structure of the game... but for now, something shippable is the target. With games we don't want a real human intelligence (humans get bored and leave, a few cheat) but rather a reliable player at a customizable skill level.",1346893370

4482348,comment,4481234,4481663,6,0,gnosis,,,"You might be interested in ""zargs"" in zsh, which would save you the call to find.<p>Furthermore, instead of the pipe to sed and extra xargs, it might be clearer and simpler to do something like:<p><pre><code>  zargs -n 1 **/*.jpg -- make-thumb\n</code></pre>\nWhere ""make-thumb"" is a short script (or even a zsh function, if you care about saving a fork for each input file) containing:<p><pre><code>  convert -geometry 200x $1 ${1%%.jpg}_thumb.jpg\n</code></pre>\nBut, in real life, instead of writing such a script or function, what I'd probably do instead is:<p><pre><code>  zargs -n 1 **/*.jpg | vipe > myscript\n</code></pre>\nand do some quick editing in vim to modify the zargs output by hand to do whatever I need -- and then I'd run the resulting ""myscript"".  Just fyi, ""vipe"" is part of the ""moreutils"" package [1] and lets you use your editor in the middle of a pipe.<p>One final trick is for when you need to do in-place image manipulation.  Instead of using ""convert"", you can use another ImageMagick command: ""mogrify"".  It will overwrite the original file with the modified file.  Of course, you should be very careful with it.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/</a>",1346893271

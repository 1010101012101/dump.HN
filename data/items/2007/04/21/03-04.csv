15359,comment,15293,15355,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  Hotmail is a great one.  Levchin/PayPal is also very informative.  Woz is more lovable than I ever knew.  Ars Digita is an excellent case study in horrible outcomes (everybody came out rich, but still, it sounds ugly and painful).  Joe Kraus of Excite/JotSpot is always interesting, and I read anything about him I come across...he's like a perfect study in how to keep your head in a startup.",1177127404

(I've heard that Bill Joy could, which may be why he invented an OS and made a billion dollars).  For most of us, we're <i>less</i> productive if we try to code round the clock for days on end.  This applies even to very wealthy people like Bill Gates (hobby: reading biographies of famous leaders) and Larry Ellison (hobby: yacht and fighter jet races).<p>news.YC is a better way to fill that downtime than, say, watching TV or playing WoW.<p>Besides, I've already spent all evening cleaning up my messy code, fixed like a dozen bugs, and am currently banging my head against what appears to be a bug in Web.py.  A small break is called for.",1177127322

But learning from the rejection, I finally found a 'hacker' to add to the team and now we're brainstorming away.<p>So yes, the Y, its news and 'rejection' was a very good thing.  Not to mention reading some really great comments from the community itself.",1177126277

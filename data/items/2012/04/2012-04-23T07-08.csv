If it's such a struggle for you to be civil with me and discuss the facts rather than dragging our respective life histories into the conversation, you should find a better hobby than Hacker News.<p>Statistically, the median income for a <i>family</i> in Mountain View, California in 2007 was $105,079. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California#Demographics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California#Demog...</a>) (This is higher than San Francisco, and MTV also includes more families with children, which is why I've chosen it as a basis of comparison.) Compare that to a <i>individual</i> income of roughly half again as much. Unless you're asserting that more than 50% of Mountain View families are struggling to get by, you have to admit that someone who can't make ends meet on 150k has an unusually high level of financial commitment. Such a person is unlikely to be a startup CEO, especially since most startups fail and leave their employees suddenly unemployed.<p>I'd rather not get into your personal business, so let's speak more generally. Medical school is expensive and leaves one with a lot of debt, but unless you've made a horrible mistake, it also makes you a physician, who presumably can earn enough income to cover that debt. If not, medical school is a terrible investment. But in Mountain View, at least, the average physician apparently earns $131,000 a year (<a href=""http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Physician-l-Mountain-View,-CA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Physician-l-Mountain-View,-CA...</a>), which means our hypothetical CEO/doctor couple has a combined income of $281,000, about 2 and 2/3 times the median. I don't know anything about you or your friends, and I don't really care to because it's not a personal argument despite your constant desire to make it so, but if being unable to make ends meet on almost three times the median family income in your town <i>isn't</i> overextending yourself, what is?",1335167987

Only CS5 and 5.5 owners get upgrade pricing for CS6.<p>There is a temporary reprieve for CS 3 & 4 owners until the end of 2012 (they backtracked somewhat after user feedback).

Here's what I've gathered from having it happen to me so many times.<p>If someone brings something like that to you as a manager, you have to realize that they are <i>highly</i> motivated about what they're doing and that you shouldn't get in the way of that unless its affecting other things that are a priority for you.<p>Its a very rare case where there is a valid reason to tell someone to completely <i>stop</i> working on something that they're doing, if there is, then outline it in simple terms and have a good discussion about it and how they feel about it, instead of just commanding them to stop.<p>The only valid reason these side projects are a problem is that they become a distraction for the employee. A skillful manager will know how to use this project as a carrot to let the employee perform better on the major projects that you want them to do. ""If you can get me x by the 12th instead of the 15th then I'll give you 2 days to work on your side project on company time"".<p>Its also the case that as a manager, you're overconfident about your abilities to foretell the usefulness of an idea to the firm. Only 1 out of about 5 side projects I've ever done for companies , I worked for, turned out to be total busts, all the others were pretty popular when I put them out but if I bet if I had asked my managers before I did them, they would have told me they wanted me to work on something else.<p>Overall, show interest in what they're trying to do ... talk through it with them, you'll learn a lot more about your employees by seeing what genuinely excites them than the stuff you just assign to them.",1335167946

3877795,comment,3876136,3876136,1,0,zby,,,"First of all I don't care how a library is written - what I care is only its interface. Functional is more black box - if the abstraction suits you then it is great.  OO is more manipulable, adaptable - you can override methods, set state etc.  I also suspect that imperative programming is more natural (think cooking recipes and other instructions how to make something).  In many cases the optimal solution is to provide two APIs - a functional, simple one, that covers most of the cases - and an OO one for the cases when people need to adapt the solution (this is often related to providing good defaults: <a href=""http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2012/04/breaking-problems-down-and-defaults.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2012/04/breaking-problems-do...</a>).<p>It is very nice if all you need is a simple function - and in that case sure you should use a library with functional API - but  what if your needs are more complex?  This is why I don't buy the  ""functional programming at the low level"" idea.<p>The thing I would like to see is a way to mark a function as pure in imperative languages which would be checked by the compiler.  That check would enforce that all variables are local and that no system function is called - but it could still call imperative code and also OO code that uses state manipulation - the only restriction would be that all that state is local (that is it is on the stack of the outer function that we mark as 'pure').",1335167878

So you are likely to find good programmers in Clojure than in Java.

I didn't write anything great, but it was a lot of fun to play with new ideas.<p>For (2) I decided a couple of weeks ago to implement my own Lisp[1]. I know almost nothing about Lisp and so I'm making a lot of mistakes and re-inventing the wheel a lot, but having a language whose syntax or semantics is changeable on a whim is just <i>so much fun</i>. Want a syntax for function literals? You can add it. Always thought that hashmaps should be a special case of functions? You can add that too. I can't recommend this enough as a way to rekindle your interest in computer science. I'm going to work on the language in my spare time for a couple more weeks, and then try to write a compiler for it. I've never written a compiler before (I was a math major, not computer science). I have no idea how you do it. But I'm pretty certain it's going to be fun.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335165939&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Pr...</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/chris-taylor/Haskeme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chris-taylor/Haskeme</a>",1335166202

It was just too much work because the tools to do great custom layouts on the web just don't exist.<p>Compared to what should be possible by now, CSS is pretty primitive.

Get a few hundred thousand people to send them to the the major telecommunications providers and ad networks and then assemble the team for a class action.<p>This is a perfectly valid tactic to use against private interests that are violating peoples 4th, 5th and 1st amendment rights.<p>And to forestall some of the objections; it is a tactic that is uncertain of success and that will in the short term most likely cause the passage of unconstitutional legislation protecting service providers against the public ( like the blanket amnesty for wrongdoing granted to phone companies in 2008 as part of FISA ). Having several thousand plaintiffs trying to get certified as a class, and overcome the additional hurdles that will be thrown in the way will force the issue into the light; and let's be honest do you think that most people think the government <i>needs</i> to know exactly where they sleep each night?",1367722754

5657279,comment,5656603,5656750,12,0,cliffbean,,,"Similarly, structured control flow (C's if, for, while, switch etc.) is better than unstructured (LLVM IR just has the equivalent of gotos (yes, LLVM IR has switch too, but it can go anywhere, so it still isn't inherently structured)). So it goes both ways.<p>Some other advantages of C over LLVM IR:<p>ABI compatibility with C <i>automatically</i>. In LLVM IR, being ABI-compatible with C is often a considerable headache and you have to do different things on each platform.<p>You can use C libraries by #including their header files (the way many C libraries were designed to be used), instead of hardwiring all that information (macro expansions, enum values, typedefs, inline functions, struct definitions, etc.) from their header files in your code generator.<p>You have the option of switching C compilers; you're not as locked into a single backend.<p>With a bit of care, you can make your output much more readable. LLVM IR demands either SSA form (most front-ends don't want to do this) or herds of allocas, loads, and stores everywhere. In C, you just say ""int x;"" to declare an int, and just ""x"" to refer to it.<p>You can use C features like bitfields, designated initializers, short-circuit operators (&&, ||), compound assignment (+=, -=, etc.), and so on. You can do all these things in LLVM IR, but you have to lower them yourself.",1367722635

There's the tradeoff between theoretical horrible blowup in vtable waste from apps dynamically adding tons of methods and tons of classes, with a unique vtable slot required for each method name across all classes, vs. falling back to doing hash-table lookups all the way up the inheritance chain for ""unusual"" method names ones you reach certain thresholds for waste.<p>You do incur the cost of propagating vtable changes down the inheritance tree when methods are dynamically redefined in other places than leaves, but it is fairly rare to see apps where this happens at a very high rate, and the number of subclasses usually fairly small, so it is likely to be quite cheap. Doing it that way is something I first saw in a technical report by (now) prof. Michael Franz from '93 or '94 on ""Protocol Extension"" for Oberon.<p>You can probably also get some decent gains by adding heuristics to give preference to names that appears to be used in loops when picking names for the vtables to reduce the need of any JIT'ing.",1367720336

What you described sounds very much like falling due to communism. I have heard a quote ""They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work,"" and I suppose my question is which side caused the ohter. My opinion was that ""they pretend to pay us"" came first (the domestic economy collapsed under military spending) and ""we pretend to work"" followed. Do you think this is true or do you think it happened the other way around?<p>I cannot believe that starvation and apathy could coexist, so at some point the USSR's system must have prevented people from working for additional income, yes? In this case, the distinction between BI and communism becomes apparent: if the supply of labor falls below demand in BI, wages rise until people go back to work. Companies function as usual and are free to fire lazy workers.

5657155,comment,5655047,5656579,2,0,calinet6,,,"Funny that the reason I love Boston so much as a tech scene is that it feels smaller and more accessible than SF, in the same way Myrtle Beach must feel even smaller and more accessible than Boston.<p>Sounds like there's a balance of many factors going on, with a sweet-spot depending on your needs and desires. Maybe someone can make a ""startup location"" tool that takes all the variables and spits out the perfect city for your startup!",1367719542
5657154,comment,5656906,5656906,34,0,zalzane,,,"This feels like one of the most ""in your face"" scams I've seen in awhile.<p>The first thing I wanted to find out when I visited the site is where they got their funding - of course that section is absent from the site.\nThe second thing I looked up is how they expected to get there and how they were solving the engineering challenges involved. On the technology page I found a dumbed down list of the different modules involved in the launch, and on the ""is this really possible?"" page I got a tidbit telling me they were using solar panels and nonpressurized rovers.<p>The icing on the cake is the $38 application fee and the note that ""The entire plan revolves around the use of existing, validated technology"".",1367719525

This release means that Sid (""unstable"") just became ""testing"". Now, many folks are running Sid fine on their desktops, but historically the Sid -> testing push is volatile in the short term, and you probably would want to wait a couple weeks.<p>Basically, be wary of ""testing"" after a release.",1367719429

5657147,comment,5655047,5655995,2,0,calinet6,,,"Very much more complex, I think, stemming from diverse historical and cultural differences. I would put it that Boston is actually more truly liberal than even SF: Massachusetts, after all, put many policies into action that California even could not actually do (sure sure, it was the central valley, but still). Boston, being authentically liberal, and more generally authentic itself, is rather conservative about its liberalism. We still have some puritanical roots, and discussion still needs to be proper and polite, and politics is not brought to the table often for this reason. The general social protocol here is to be nice, pay attention to what you say, think carefully before you say it, don't offend, be agreeable.<p>SF is quite the opposite: discussion of anything is on the table, you say things first and think later or think by talking, everyone is expected to offend and to not be offended by anything, and if you cross any lines you're told so bluntly and argue back. It's a culture of debate, it's anti-puritan, anti-polite, and more free-as-in-speech free. But what you say becomes more important than what you believe, and your beliefs are allowed to be much more malleable and impermanent. Because of this, I say that it's less authentic, in that people are less solid in their ways and more apt to say what's popular or interesting at the time rather than what they solidly believe, and thus, they form fewer things solidly.<p>Disclaimer: I grew up in California, went to school in the Bay, and have lived in Boston for five years. I feel I survive well here because I actually fit in better with the slightly more intellectually conservative culture; or at least I feel like I understand it well enough. I think these cultural differences are fascinating because the cities share so many similarities otherwise.<p>I think the HubSpot article actually makes sense in this contextBoston folks do tend to be more loyal, have more of a sense of permanence both intellectually and socially, and know how to live through a good cold wintera quality and gumption not to be overlooked!<p>Anyway, interesting and fascinating, and dripping with stereotypes and generalization, but in a good way. :)",1367719362

I object to the notion of giving BI preferentially to women, although I fully support the cause of ensuring they receive their share.<p>Please clarify what you meant.",1367719339

5657142,comment,5655165,5657067,8,0,Mithaldu,,,"> Too much perl code is essentially write once and forget.<p>Please stop repeating this misconception. People who put little effort into learning how to program write ""write-once"" code in any language. Perl had the ""misfortune"" of being the only dynamic language on the block for a long time, leading to many people reaching for it to get things done without bothering to actually learn the language, thus creating a vast corpus of low quality code.<p>(It does not help that the definitive resource of Perl for bioinformatics people, which i've seen in libraries like those of the Genome Campus in Cambridge, isn't worthy of being used as toilet paper, yet influenced a whole generation of scientists.)<p>> I've spent far too many hours trying to figure out what a perl script does<p>How often do you reach for perltidy when you do this?",1367719308

I know of a messaging app that has spammed the hell out of my friends. The trick is that it will ask for contact info and then automatically send SMS to all of them asking to install it.

There are approximately 3B base pairs in it, which sounds like a lot, but think of it in terms of binary data.  DNA is composed of 4 bases, so that's base 4; converting to base 2 gives you approximately 6 billion bits of data.  While that's a lot of data to sift through by hand, it's not a lot of data for a computer to deal with.  Obviously, there's a lot we simply don't understand yet, but I wonder how much your average hacker can bring to the table.  After all, That's only 5.5GB to toss around -- nothing, these days.",1277459825

Those non tantalum capacitors then to end of life faster if you're operating in high humidity conditions.<p>This reminded me of a number of random crashes that a client of my previous company had. Stackdumps just showed random errors. We had about a years worth of crash logs from a couple thousand of network switches (they were an ISP). We initially suggested that this might be a problem with cosmic rays. We even checked the frequency of the random crashes with sunspot cycles. No relationship found. Turns out it was due to another component failing due to a design error.",1277459411

1460371,comment,1460087,1460291,0,0,daeken,,,"People seem to have a skewed perception of how to defeat timing attacks, generally.  At the end of the day, it's more about making things constant time than trying to make the timing difficult to detect.  Simple example:<p>You have two hashes and want to see if they're equal.  The naive approach is to iterate over each byte in both hashes and compare them, then break when you find a byte that doesn't match.  That approach, however, could be vulnerable to a timing attack because you could potentially measure how many times it iterates.  An implementation that's resistant to timing attacks could XOR each byte of each hash and accumulate across them; if that accumulator is zero at the end of the loop, it's equal.  That approach is constant time, rather than being dependent on the data you're dealing with.",1277458848

It is after all possible, according to the syntax, and a minifier should be able to understand it, as well as your browser.<p>I am certainly not against coding practices or readability. With (Q)BASIC, you could also add semicolons and have multiple statements per line, but who did ? It seems that it is the same with Javascript, semicolons are separators between statements, as well as newlines : why write both ? just to be sure they are well separated ?",1277456978

1460341,comment,1459956,1460328,0,0,pbiggar,,,"Don't be ridiculous. The idea that you should force your users to adopt your (well intentioned, well thought-out) preferences with no options is a very recent idea, and its only adherents are coders and designers. While users don't necessarily like hunting for options, they don't like when they are taken away (ask the Pidgin people, for a well documented fork which happened because of this idea).<p>The suggestion that this causes the 30 second delay is crap. An empty firefox takes about 2 seconds to load for me; a new window takes seconds.  My experience (and a cursory chat with firefox devs) is that it is really memory usage which slows firefox down, and I believe this is being helped in the new version.<p>100k lines is total exaggeration. I'd suggest that checking for the flag is one line, and implementing it the other way is less than 1000 lines (I would think less than 100, but I'll leave myself some breathing room). It's not like they can remove the whole about:config thing just because this one button is gone.<p>And if you think that removing a checkbox that nobody uses will make a ""noticeably better browser"", then you are dreaming.",1277456782

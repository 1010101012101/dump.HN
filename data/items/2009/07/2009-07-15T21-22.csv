Instead of sending hate mail to near-insolvent homeowners, banks should reach out to borrowers and offer lower interest payments in exchange for equity.""<p>As I understand it, most that will walk away from their homes are upside down, meaning they owe more on the property than it is worth. That is also the reason that they're unable to refinance.<p>So the authors suggest that the bank lower the interest on the loan in exchange for equity which the homeowner has none of?",1247695198

706684,comment,706343,706607,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yes, your experience will be different from that of most end users. But it will be <i>minimally biased</i> - you won't be baking in the settings that sound good on one set of cheap speakers but which would sound like total ass on other ones where cost has been saved in other ways.<p>For example, many hifi and computer speakers come with some kind of bass boost. If I edit something using speakers like that there will be little or no bass on speakers which don't have that 'feature'. Or if I go in the other direction and finish on speakers that sound rather thin, the result will be an unmerciful honking noise on anything with a bass boost. Using a pair of (moderately) expensive speakers means I can split the difference, and know that while it will never sound as good as I'd like on consumer speakers, it will never sound too awful either.<p>If you still don't think it matters, watch some short films or videos on YouTube. Then take even a modest Hollywood movie and notice how vastly, enormously better it sounds. Obsessing over sound and color seems trivial to those who don't have to work on content, but the very fact that most people take these things for granted is what fuels that obsession: because people are so sensitive they notice very quickly if the quality is off, even if they can't articulate why.",1247695062

And even when you find one, nobody ever gives the bit depth.<p>The reason the quality has been (and is) receding is because manufacturers have noticed that most people can't tell the difference between e.g. TN and IPS displays, so they produce the former, which are much cheaper. And better options are being phased out all the time; the two LCDs I have were phased out within a couple years. An S-IPS panel now costs at least $100 more than a same-size TN panel, and usually at much lower advertised contrast ratios, which further puts off consumers.

Furthermore, he's got a holier-than-thou stance in which Zed is on the cause of Good and Sanity and the person he's decided to rant against is scum.<p>The man is incredibly immature when he gets into those states. He ignores all evidence going against him, doesn't listen to his debaters, and proceeds as if everybody on the planet other than him is shit-filled.

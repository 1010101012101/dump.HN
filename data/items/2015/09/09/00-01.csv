I&#x27;ve been waiting a year for it to get cleared up.<p>It sounds like we made the right choice, though, because in this thread the people who are complaining about Node seem to be the ones who tried switching back and forth between IO and Node.  There is actually only one bug in Node that has impacted me (related to the way connections are shut down) and it isn&#x27;t fixed yet in master so not upgrading hasn&#x27;t really impacted us.  We just have to live without some of the ES6 features.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m a big fan of Go (old C++ programmer).  We started using it a little over 2 years ago.  The language definition has changed in that time, so I wouldn&#x27;t call it stable ;-)  The core libraries are rock solid, though.  We barely use any 3rd party libraries (I think we use 2) so it&#x27;s not really fair to compare that with other languages.<p>Although we have a fair amount of python in our shop, I don&#x27;t seem to work on those projects very much (a month here and there).  I can&#x27;t say too much about it other than our Python code breaks due to 3rd party libraries more often than any of our other code.  However, I think this is probably due to injudicious choices for our 3rd party libraries ;-)<p>Overall, I would say that my experiences don&#x27;t match yours, but I wonder if it&#x27;s because we never tried moving to IO.",1441759264

This is bad in a setting like online advertising where you might have millions of features (i.e. n is large) for two reasons. First, this makes training your model very slow. Second, you won&#x27;t have enough observations to learn all weights w_{i,j} well. So using all quadratic weights in the online advertising setting is not feasible. But we still want to include feature interaction information. Enter FM.<p>To answer your question, FM is good for two main reasons. First, as a result of some mathematical magic, we can train the model in a time that scales linearly with the time needed to train a model without interaction terms. Second, each of the n features gets embedded in an inner product space with similar features ending up close to one another in some sense.

It doesn&#x27;t actually produce music, rather, it sends MIDI instructions for how to play music somewhere and leaves it up some other program to make the sounds.<p>As a fellow musician, I&#x27;d much rather some other program be involved in actually making the sounds.  My workflow generally involves defining abstract voices (usually some traditional soprano/alto/tenor/baritone plus rhythm/percussion, though I do like to branch out of that sometimes) and reserving actual instrument/voice specifics for once the composition process is done with.  I feel like the various other languages out there that &quot;can <i>actually</i> make music internally&quot; are more equivalent to making a physical piano roll than writing a score that any musician or group thereof - regardless of instrumentation - can perform.<p>This preference probably comes from my background in the drum & bugle corps and brass band worlds, where a brass ensemble will often be tasked with playing some piece originally intended for, say, a choir or chamber ensemble or organ.  I&#x27;ve developed an appreciation of the ability to separate composition from instrumentation, and it looks like Alda is well suited to that, at least at first glance.",1441757719

Most internet users are locked behind home or corporate networks, without a real addressable IP and every port but 80 and 443 blocked. A lot of this was done in the name of security (exactly how does blocking a port or ignoring a ping response make you secure? I&#x27;ve never heard a valid technical reason for this being more secure, beyond tradition-says-so answers.), but is really due to cargo-cult sysadmin behavior and bad default settings on hardware.<p>Now we&#x27;ve basically ruined IPv4, peer to peer communication doesn&#x27;t work for enough users to make it useless, forcing the centralized server-client model. It&#x27;s not just hardware with bad defaults - try accessing a (non-localhost) website hosted on a port 6666 in Chrome. You can&#x27;t, Chrome has a blacklist of &quot;insecure&quot; ports. I am baffled such a concept even exists, ports aren&#x27;t secure or insecure, they are a channel for data.

Here is my brief summary of this paper.<p>This paper is discussing meditation in a fairly broad sense, which includes practices related to eastern religions (Buddhism, Hindu), abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), as well as modern practices found in a modern clinical setting (CBT).<p>They propose a classification of meditation practices. At the top level, there are three types of meditation: (1) Attentive Meditation, (2) Constructive Meditation, and (3)Deconstructive Meditation.<p>Attentive meditation has to do with controlling ones focus. These practices generally have the practitioner intentionally narrow or broaden their focus. Zen breath counting and body scanning meditation are examples of Attentive meditation.<p>Constructive meditation practices aim to create and strengthen healthy habits, or commitments to certain values. This could involve imagining what it&#x27;s like to be others, or imagining yourself as an embodiment of certain values. Constructive practices may also have the practitioner contemplate their own mortality, so that they can consider what is truly important in life. Christians praying to God for strength and thinking about their immortal soul are examples of Constructive meditation.<p>Deconstructive meditation practices aim to foster insight into the perceptions, emotions, and cognition of the practitioner. Self-inquiry and contemplation on these objects themselves are often a part of this type of practice. CBT and other modern clinical techniques are examples of Deconstructive meditation.<p>------------------------------------<p>A couple other notes:<p>* All three types of meditation seem to be useful in different ways.\n* It&#x27;s uncertain to what extent do the effects of specific meditations rest on the frameworks, beliefs, and world views that underlie these practices.",1441756846

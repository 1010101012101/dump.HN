Sorry to confuse you. The post is actually meant to be for people who come from ST and move over to Atom. There is no particular useful feature I am aware of (except maybe the git integration) that requires everyone to make the switch. I just wrote this post to show how I use Atom now and that it basically capable of everything I liked about ST. It&#x27;s not really this is better than that, it&#x27;s just that I have now two editors that work great for me :)",1436702276

But the contiguous disk chunks don&#x27;t correspond to contiguous virtual addresses, and when reading them back in, the order is just however the application chooses to access the pages, so it&#x27;s quite random and hard to predict.  And you can only buffer writes, not reads - you have to block reads until you get the data.<p>25 years ago you might have 4MB of swap, at 4KB page size that&#x27;s 1000 pages, or 1000 potential individual points you may have to seek to.<p>Today 4GB of swap is sort of a minimum size that&#x27;s not entirely useless, and that&#x27;s 1 million pages, or 1 million potential seek points.<p>So IMHO putting swap on hard disks with 5-10 ms seek latency was very useful back in the day, but is pretty much obsolete now - if you need swap put it on flash based storage.",1436701862

However they never officially supported flash.
Also the updates were pretty much delayed and while a author on xda could be way faster on bringing updates + a smoother feeling to the phone a company like motorola couldn&#x27;t they announced phone by phone instead of focusing on a few and supporting them.
Thats why most companies failed and thats why the iphone is so beloved.
It&#x27;s supported over a freak amount of time. Okai not every bug gets fixed fast, but that&#x27;s more an internal issue.

Even when you agree with the social media crowd it seems wrong to let it direct your project&#x27;s decisions though the sheer volume of its comments, especially so if many of the people commenting aren&#x27;t involved with the project even as users.<p>From what I have seen so far I can deduce that the technical side of the problem is essentially this:<p>* Limiting the issues to only the contributors excludes the actual users along with the strangers and encourages the more angry strangers to spam you with duplicate issues.<p>* Allowing everyone to comment drowns out thoughtful discussion with &quot;plus ones&quot; and &quot;thumbs up&quot; icons, as well as purposefully uncivil comments.<p>* GitHub&#x27;s moderation tools are too weak to moderate the individual comments.<p>When your project faces this pressure how do you act to ensure that meaningful discussion happens and decisions are made that are the best for your actual users and contributors in the long run?",1436699424

That doesn&#x27;t stop from going to it and why should it? Unless Reddit is explicitly and only doing this, I don&#x27;t care. There are hundreds of good subreddits that are strictly moderated and harassment is not allowed. And yet there are others which I cannot stand. But I can easily ignore those.<p>Should we stop using the Internet because there is violent stuff and discriminatory content? Or should we using Twitter for the same reasons?

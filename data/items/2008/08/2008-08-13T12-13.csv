The technology has gotten so cool that it has become the star instead of the tool to service the real star.<p>The rest of us don't understand what the technology is and what it can do.  A perfect example...<p>We went to our favorite restaurant Saturday night and it was dead.  Excellent food, concept, and service.  Across the street from a 10,000 student university.  The owner greets every customer and remembers most of us.  He even asks how my mother is doing.  Everything is homemade, healthy, and delicious.<p>He complained that he was swamped for lunch, but dead for dinner and didn't know what to do.  After 2 beers, I suggested:<p>- When it looks like it's going to be a slow night, tweet your regulars with a 2 for 1 discount.<p>- Email ""Buy Lunch, Get Dinner That Week"" coupons to your regulars<p>- Establish a Facebook presence with daily specials at the local university<p>- Offer free wifi during happy hour<p>- Advertise on one of the ""10 Buck Dinner"" sites<p>- Build a database for college student ""meal tickets""<p>To which he said, ""You could do all that?""",1218630537

274896,comment,274016,274664,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"If biking hurts your knees, your bike is probably the wrong size / needs to be adjusted. Your legs might be bowed outward too much, your feet may be turned in or out (putting pressure on the knee while slightly twisted, bad news), your seat might be too low, etc. Running around with your knees bent almost 90 deg. will make them ache very quickly, riding a bike too small for you is very similar.<p>(You may also be riding in too high a gear. Spinning in a fairly high RPM is best, fighting against a heavy gear is hard on the knees.)<p>Any bike shop worth its lingering rubber smell should be able to help you find a bike that fits like a glove. If you don't enjoy cycling, that's one thing, but don't write it off just because you tried it on the wrong bike. Running in shoes three sizes too small probably wouldn't be any fun either. :)",1218629091

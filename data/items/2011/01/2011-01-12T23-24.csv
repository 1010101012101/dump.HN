If all you're doing is playing mp3s at 192 kbit/s, existing wireless is fine and future wireless will be more than adequate.  There's no need to add the expense of putting local storage on a mobile device if you can achieve the same end cheaper with cloud hosting.<p>Now, this is all academic, as we're talking about a radio, and I don't think they're likely to be around by then.

Max von Laue and James Franck had deposited their medals there to keep them from being confiscated by the German authorities. After the occupation of Denmark in April 1940, the medals were Bohr's first concern, according to the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy (also of Jewish origin and a 1943 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry), who worked at the institute. In Hitler's Germany it was almost a capital offense to send gold out of the country. Since the names of the Laureates were engraved on the medals, their discovery by the invading forces would have had very serious consequences. To quote George de Hevesy (Adventures in Radioisotope Research, Vol. 1, p. 27, Pergamon, New York, 1962), who talks about von Laue's medal: ""I suggested that we should bury the medal, but Bohr did not like this idea as the medal might be unearthed. I decided to dissolve it. While the invading forces marched in the streets of Copenhagen, I was busy dissolving Laue's and also James Franck's medals. After the war, the gold was recovered and the Nobel Foundation generously presented Laue and Frank with new Nobel medals."" de Hevesy wrote to von Laue after the war that the task of dissolving the medals had not been easy, as gold is ""exceedingly unreactive and difficult to dissolve."" The Nazis occupied Bohr's institute and searched it very carefully but they did not find anything. The medals quietly waited out the war in a solution of aqua regia.",1294876063

2098195,comment,2097429,2097429,0,0,chad_oliver,,,"I'm a student studying engineering. This year, I did really well in physics because my lecturer had given us a list of 40 questions from the textbook that covered everything we needed to know. I spent the day before the exam going through all the questions, and when I got into the exam I knew how to answer every single question. I got an A for that exam.<p>On the other hand, I failed my maths exam. There were various reasons for this, but one was simply that I spend to long looking at textbook, and not enough time answering questions. A full quarter of the questions in the exam were totally new to me; I had absolutely no idea how to even begin answering them.<p>The moral of the story? I would pay good money for a website that provided a set of questions that covered everything I needed to know. Obviously that's a big ask, especially at the university level. Perhaps you could allow users to define what categories of questions they need to be able to handle, or even create rules for generating new sets of questions. If I could spend 2 hours defining what questions I should be asked (and then share those settings with others in my class), then spend the rest of the day practicing those questions, that would be a day well spent.<p>What would I pay for that? Easily $20/semester, probably closer to $50.<p>Another way I could use this website is for revision or passive learning. Start with basic maths, and slowly add new categories of questions (negative numbers, then algebra, then calculus). If you could somehow generate <i>how</i> to solve the question, that would be even better - you could have an ""I'm stuck, how do I solve this"" button that would be perfect for learning at your own pace. Alternatively, you could just have one 'methods' page per category of questions, and every question of that type would link to that page. It would be feasible to hand-write those pages, or allow others to write them (or even just add their own notes that only they see).<p>Also, you might want to learn about spaced repetition learning - perhaps it's something you could implement.<p>If you don't want to use all (or any) of these ideas, that's fine. What you've got is great, but I hope my ideas get you thinking!<p>And finally, best of luck. I hope you change (this corner of) the world.",1294875576

Law is really winner take all. The winners get $160k/yr starting and 60-70 hour workweeks and will pay off their loans in roughly 10 years at ~$1500-$2000 a month.

One of the potential investors has expressed interest in doing it as convertible debt.   I understand the concepts of convertible pretty well, but don't have a sense of where the market is.  Assuming a medium-risk existing business, what are typical terms as far as interest paid and degree of discount should it be converted?<p>Also, I've seen mention that YCombinator would eventually be releasing some standardized term sheets for convertible.  Are these available somewhere?  Are there others that could be used as a template in the meantime?   Right now my goal isn't to come up with the best possible terms, only to figure out where the center of 'fair' is to evaluate whether this is something we should consider.",1294873658

ImageMagick fit the niche that the web needs server-side image processing library and made money from it. But GIMP is client-side, semi-professional image processing software, who have the incentive to financially support it? (Maybe some professional graphic design companies, but again, they may not have the top-dev for image processing software, that is a big investment for them).

Now my impression (from a great distance) of the Android market compared to the iPhone market is that the Android one is much more dominated by ads.  Also, this aligns better with Google's corporate goals (to plaster advertising over everything in sight).<p>So, in conclusion, I would say that kreci is doing pretty good, and that he has a good match of business models to the environment he is in.<p>@kreci - thanks for sharing your data",1294873221

1594866,comment,1593643,1594016,0,0,jbarham,,,"In my experience owning a motorcycle in Canada or the US is more expensive than owning a small car.<p>Even medium sized sport or sport touring motorcycles (e.g., Honda VFR) aren't cheap to run.  The engines are tuned for performance not fuel efficiency and usually need premium fuel, so small cars are about as cheap to re-fuel per mile.  Also the maintenance cost that killed me was tires: You have to pay around $500 dollars for (two) good tires on a motorcycle every 10k miles (if you're lucky) whereas I spent only $200 at Costco for (four) tires for my car that should last more than 50k miles.<p>Also consider than motorcycles depreciate faster than cars and the resale market is less liquid so you lose more money when you sell.<p>Summary: Buy motorcycles because they're fun, not because they're cheap!<p>Granted a 50cc <i>scooter</i> would certainly be cheaper to run  than a car but then you're restricted to city streets (i.e., no highways).",1281538676

I don't know if this is the common way they use to introduce NP-completeness in CS classes, but it's very easy to understand. And his comment that ""If you can show that a new proof can solve weaker questions, even questions that are known, that can be very confidence building."" is an excellent glimpse into a mathematicians way of thinking. <i>This</i> is exactly the reason, they are not too fond of brute force proofs (like the Rubik, God's number = 20 proof announced earlier this wee.): it doesn't teach any new mathematical tricks.<p>However, what excites me even more than a possible proof to P!=NP is the new wiki and blog based open collaborative approach of researchers. Yes, we had instances of this before, but I think this is the first time such an approach is used to analyze a result of this magnitude, and in such short time.

Consider also that people doing this generally rinse/repeat, rather than using the first couple of good trade-ups to set them selves up financially.  Lots of people with big fat expensive homes got there this way and now can't afford to live there, or to sell them.<p>I know a whole bunch of people who bought houses 10 years ago and, today, if they sold their homes, would have lost several times what I've paid in rent during that same period.  If they can hold out until the market returns they'll be okay, if not, who knows.... but now they're stuck with them.<p>The key is to just put some clarity around what mortgaging, or even buying a home outright, really is - and why you are doing it.<p>If you are doing it because you WANT to own a home and you think it's a magic, foolproof investment - that's foolish. Those are two different things.<p>If you're doing it because you WANT to own that particular home and raise your family there for the next 30 years, then some day retire to a smaller apartment, or even stay there until it's time for the funny-farm, and you are doing it on terms you can afford over that time, that's fine - but your primary reason in this case is not as an investment.  You will have expenses along the way that are more or less the same as renting. and while it seems unlikely over a 30 years span, it's always possible that the home won't be worth much in terms of equity 30 years later when you want to sell it. (the dollar value may have gone way up, but the cost of living will have risen as well.  I'm not saying there will be no equity, but it may not be the best investment you could have made, and it could easily turn out to be a bad one)<p>If you are into the real-estate business for investment purposes, then you should be studying various real-estate markets and looking for the best opportunities to buy/fix/hold/sell strategically.

Also, not all the development of Scala is done at EPFL; for example Paul Phillips (one of the key contributors to the compiler) doesn't work there (and isn't an academic so doesn't need to be concerned with publishing papers).<p>On another note, I don't believe that plugins for IDEs should necessarily be contributed by the 'core' Scala team. It makes more sense to me that people closer to the IDE in question are in a better position to write effective plugins. The Intellij plugin was written internally by Intellij and is perfectly usable in my opinion.

When faced with this issue, the common wisdom is to target a small niche at first. Over time, you can branch out to other users. There are many examples of this, such as Facebook starting with just Harvard students for example.<p>The strategy makes a lot of sense, but the question is what niche should one choose? In our particular case, we need to sign up people who browse many of the same web pages. This is necessary because our app, Jellly, is meant to suggest related links as users browse the web, so there better be other users who saw some of the same web pages earlier and already suggested related links.<p>The “hacker” niche, as represented by this community, may be a good choice here, but I’m not sure. We had thought about targeting bloggers, as they are often all looking at the same blog posts and articles; they provide free marketing and they could get into an app like this (it’s much better than using track-backs for sure), and they’d be happy to get some traffic out of it too by linking their own posts to other relevant stuff on Jellly. But the overall blogosphere is huge; the target needs to be more focused than that at first. Hacker-bloggers?<p>To better understand Jellly and our problem, you could take a peek at our FAQ.

I use RSS because it means I don't have to hit the site as frequently, and only when it has new content. If this had a way of both showing the unread counts of all feeds as well as allowing you to read the original site, I think it would be the solution to the problem that RSS readers originally solved.<p>This is just an idea for the service. I developed something very similar, but you can't go to the original site and still get stories marked as read as you read them.

There's nothing you can do about the fact that other drivers suck.<p>The real issue is that even if you only get in as many accidents on your motorcycle as you would have in your car (which is probably nonzero, even if you're a great driver--other drivers suck, remember), each one is <i>way</i> more likely to kill you or cause serious injury when you're not surrounded by a ton of steel.",1281535462

Does the fact that it could be considered irrational invalidate any value of the altruism?<p>I was most interested in the last part, where they were seeing if people would help another person who was right in front of them. It shows something more about simple compassion, which I consider different from altruism. It also helps address your point about organized charitable activities: it was an opportunity to give what would have been perceived as help someone more in the here and now and less in the airy ""well, this seems like a good percentage of my income to donate to charity..."".",1281535451

I'd reckon the number would be a lot smaller, but given the terrific quantity of CD drives that exist out in the world right now, I think the chances of one still existing is pretty good.<p>Even if it didn't, if you compare the costs of many other storage techniques, they're probably equivalent to jerry-rigging a CD player to read back these disks. The difference is the cost is shifted to the reading and not the storage.<p>Your main risk is the shonky assumptions of the ""archival"" CD manufacturer.

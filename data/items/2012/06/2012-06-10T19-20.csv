4092016,comment,4087631,4091845,1,0,floomp,,,"> What makes you certain you have identified the process required to be religious? ""Required"" is a strong word, implying that it is impossible to become religious through any other process than the one you assume.<p>I was probably ambiguous, but I didn't mean to imply that there was only one process to be religious. Only that the processes to be religious aren't compatible with the processes that one uses to accept science. If you used the same level of scrutiny on religion as you do with evolution or gravity (or luminiferous aether), you'd reject religion.<p>> Some may begin from premises that are not falsifiable, but it's quite a stretch to say that's required.<p>Are there any falsifiable assertions that can convince someone to rationally become religious, and which address religion itself rather than the social and mental effects of being religious?<p>> You don't need to think that even if you're a total Bible-thumper. As long as your Bible-thumping includes an appropriate understanding of history, such that you recognize the creation story as a response to the Egyptian creation account [0], rather than as a response to Darwin.<p>Assuming said Bible-thumper doesn't interpret the Bible literally, I suppose so. But there's still the problem that they started with a religious belief and were able to mold it to fit evolution in - they didn't apply the same base standards to both ideas. I don't believe that's rationally consistent.",1339358359

Framework benefits include rapid development, and familiarity (since they use preexisting languages).  The cost is that performance will never be as good as native code, and you won't be able to easily change certain behaviors.<p>The Haxe language gives you far more flexibility and performance optimizations, since it is generating optimized native source or byte code. The cost is that you have to learn the Haxe language.<p>Many people on this discussion are criticizing the java-style syntax of Haxe.  I think most of these negative feelings are due to the excessive boilerplate required for many Java classes.  Haxe does away with a lot of boilerplate code using type inference and other modern compiler techniques.  
<a href=""http://haxe.org/ref/type_infer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haxe.org/ref/type_infer</a><p>You can remove even more boilerplate with macro libraries for shorthand class declarations:
<a href=""https://github.com/back2dos/tinkerbell/wiki/tink_lang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/back2dos/tinkerbell/wiki/tink_lang</a><p>There are many other tricks you can use to define behavior without resorting to complex inheritance or class definitions.  One of my favorites is the ""using"" declaration:
<a href=""http://haxe.org/manual/using"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haxe.org/manual/using</a><p>So, in my opinion, the cost of learning Haxe is very low if you already know Java or Actionscript.  The cost of coding/writing Haxe is also very low, since you're not required to write boilerplate code.<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Haxe developers are not just trying to gloss over the technicalities of each underlying platform in order to get things working.  They <i>really</i> understand the behavior of each platform, and make many conscientious decisions based on considerations for performance and cross-platform consistency.  I've learned more from the Haxe language google group about each target (js quirks, java limitations, etc.) than I have from the Java, JS, Actionscript groups themselves:

Users are being tricked into installing malicious extensions, and thus getting compromised in significant numbers (Facebook ""like"" selling is a major target). We have continuously improving measures in the WebStore to catch malicious extensions, and the volume there is very low. However, we don't have a way of catching malicious off-store extensions. So, the best solution is to disallow other sources by default, and provide technically inclined users and enterprise administrators with the ability to add trusted sources.<p>This is basically the same model that every Linux distro uses, so I'm not sure what the complaints are about.

So it needs to reduce expenses and/or increase taxes, but in the meantime it has to borrow from the market (whether that happens through the central bank like in the US is irrelevant). Borrowed money is not free at all as you say, it comes with an interest that is paid to the private lender, not to the Fed. The interest adds to the deficit, increasing the drive for higher taxes (hence the burdening of the tax payer) and lower expenses (hence the austerity).<p>This mode of funding often amounts to a tax on the poor (through spending cuts in social programs for example) and to a lesser extent a tax on the rich (through tax hikes). A government funded directly through printed money is more of a tax on the rich, due to the loss of value of their savings and assets.

The point of the back-of-the-envelope calculation is to show this isn't the case using some simple math. The blogger could easily have run those numbers himself.<p>And the reason I said ""smells bad"" instead of ""wrong"" is that China is complex and some things that seem wrong on first pass might actually be right. As far as I know, for instance, the blogger is also wrong when he implies that the big four are holding significant amounts of Treasuries on their balance sheets. The reason I believe this is because the People's Bank of China sterilizes currency inflows and monopolizes currency exchange. So the banks which are the most exposed to non-performing SOE debt should not have the USD to invest in US Treasuries and it should mostly be the PBOC which handles Treasury purchases. Googling for terms like ""ICBC"" and ""US Treasury Bonds"" suggests this is in fact the case since it doesn't pull up any documents suggesting ICBC is buying Treasuries.

Encryption using AES if necessary. I'd be inclined to do this for a couple reasons:<p>1) If there's anything my grad crypto class taught me it's that RSA, specifically padding, is the most god-forsaken idea ever created by man and you will never, ever, ever, ever get it right. If the words RSA are in your code you are in deep shit.<p>2) S/MIME seems to be a simpler system than any certificate system I have seen. X.509 is an unholy mess. In fact, all PKI is just a complicated disaster waiting to happen.<p>3) Super simple API -- it can even be done on the command line.<p>Is there something different you'd recommend?<p>Edit: Actually, I just thought of another option. GPG has a --sign and --verify option. If GPG can be installed on the system it may be worth trying to integrate that.",1339355130

Ever seen a UPS guy on a bike, delivering everyone's Amazon orders?<p>How many of you are out there in the USA? Honestly, not many. The <i>vast</i> majority of Americans drive to get their groceries and get their shopping done. I hate to say it - but you're a relatively rare edge case.<p>There's also the unsolved problem of overstock - and the smaller the store (physically) the worse it gets. In order to maintain selection, brick and mortar stores <i>must</i> stock a large range of items, many of which sell poorly. Maybe in your entire city 5 units would get sold in a given month - but if there are 30 stores in the city, each one would now have to hang onto a single unit, since you don't know when/where a customer would want it. A great deal of overstock ends up in landfills, and even the stuff that does not, it requires <i>further</i> transportation to consolidate, and then even more transportation to liquidate.<p>For an online store, since a single facility serves a <i>much</i> larger number of customers, overstock is improved by leaps and bounds (orders of magnitude, really). This results in less garbage waste due to not having to stock a lot of stuff that isn't expected to sell, and less transportation cost also.<p>> how about slipping a tube of toothpaste in with your regular books order<p>You're thinking about something like Amazon Tote:<p><a href=""http://tote.amazon.com/AmazonToteLearnMore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tote.amazon.com/AmazonToteLearnMore</a><p>or Amazon Fresh - where non-grocery items can be included in your normal grocery run.",1279047223

And programs that are not I/O bound today, may become so down the road.<p>Incidentally on the final point, there was an interesting test that was run many years ago.  Multiple teams were given the same spec, but were each told to optimize for a different characteristics (speed of development, speed of execution, maintainability, memory use, etc).  Most of the teams managed to come in #1 on what they were trying to optimize for.  The team that optimized for maintainability came in #2 on most other characteristics.  The team that optimized for speed of execution came in last on most other characteristics.<p>The lesson from this is that a consistent focus on maintainable code results in more of everything else you need.  Yes, there really are times that you're writing throw-away code and can forget all that.  But by default, code well and let the other details take care of themselves.",1279046053

Some examples would be helpful.<p>I've built a few gadgets that collect data, analyze it, and then send it to a data store on the web. Think carefully about your needs for each of those 3 steps, as well as your readiness to get into low-level technical details. And then tell us more about what you're trying to do.<p>In the mean time, here is some general advice:<p>In my experience, the connection to the web is the most challenging part of the project, and the one that has the most impact on the total cost of parts. Most of the microcontroller kits that appeal to casual developers (such as me) do not include ethernet or wifi connectivity. They assume you will be connecting via USB to a PC. Adding wifi or ethernet to an arduino significantly increases the cost and complexity. For stationary (non-mobile, non-battery-powered) gadgets that need to communicate with the web, I can recommend using a wifi router as a development platform. Many of these can run the OpenWRT version of linux, and collect information from a USB port. Here is a good description of working with linux and USB peripherals on a wifi router: <a href=""http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-1-introduction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part...</a> As to cost, the router used in this blog post costs about $30 (<a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320023"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320...</a>).<p>Another thing to consider is the analysis step. Some devices will have no need for fancy data analysis, but for gadgets that need to work with data in complex ways (learning/compressing/transforming) you may run out of processing power and/or memory on some of the microcontroller platforms. Again, a wifi router is quite capable here - as long as you stick to fixed-point operations.<p>Once you have an idea of a suitable hardware platform, then it's off to the races. There are many great places to see examples of hardware projects, as mentioned by fragmede. And you may want to consider working with a hackerspace (NYCresistor, noisebridge, etc) - I've found that having an oscilloscope is very helpful for troubleshooting my gadget project.",1279044096

10269902,comment,10267230,10267230,0,0,anthay,,,"I&#x27;ve made this mistake in the past. In C++ I used a reference to fix it like so:<p><pre><code>    #include <cassert>

    typedef char array_xyz_type[42];

    void test(array_xyz_type & a, array_xyz_type b, char c[42], char (&d)[42])
    {
        assert(sizeof(a) == 42);
        assert(sizeof(b) == 4);
        assert(sizeof(c) == 4);
        assert(sizeof(d) == 42);
    }

    int main()
    {
        array_xyz_type x = {1,2,3};
        test(x, x, x, x);
    }
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d add these comments:<p>1. The reference makes the code somewhat less flexible in that you can&#x27;t call the function with anything other than a char[42] type, e.g. test(new char[42]...) won&#x27;t compile. (This may or may not be what you want.)<p>2. As Linus said, don&#x27;t ignore compiler warnings.<p>3. Write some code, then watch every line execute in the debugger so you see if what you wrote is what you thought you wrote. Repeat.",1443070680

So, most are blocked out.<p>Far as your example, I agree that algorithm support can&#x27;t help without good software going along with it. That&#x27;s probably true for many use cases with examples you cited being areas where proprietary tools and ecosystem dominate. Leads to some potential counters:<p>1. It might help in the many things that OSS is doing. That&#x27;s a huge list that includes desktops, phones, servers, and a few major apps.<p>2. It might help in commercial sector if their developers see the cutting edge approaches. It might be obvious where rendering advances are but most stuff is scattered: finding it took lots of searching with my keyword, kung-fu. Might be affecting discovery in proprietary side, too. I know many of them keep inventing solutions weaker than even well-cited academic stuff. Aside from patents, gotta wonder why they didn&#x27;t go with better approach if it seemed like a good fit. Likely explanation: didn&#x27;t know it existed.<p>For instance, it&#x27;s commonly believed that signal processing can only use a commercial DSP or graphics card with nothing delivered aside from that. People wanting an open alternative don&#x27;t even know where to start that&#x27;s worth anything. I heard and believed that too till I landed on this bad boy:<p><a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Asynchronous_array_of_simple_processors#/AsAP_2_chip:_167_processors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Asynchronous_array_of_simple_pro...</a><p>The architecture is described in enough detail to be clonable. It might even be licensable with open-source allowed. It should handle <i>plenty</i> of workloads and supports custom accelerators for common things. After the mask costs, it would have great price vs performance vs energy usage. Yet, with 8 years of research, I just now came across this despite the first deliverable being in 2005. Might be a dead end and might turn into something if pursued. Yet, I&#x27;m sure it had potential to benefit commercial and OSS projects whose design approach accomplished far less had they known about this.<p>So, more full and legacy systems certainly have lots of momentum. You can&#x27;t just have a piece of a system. I think even they might be affected by the problem I describe, though, given they&#x27;re as sub-optimal vs cutting edge as OSS often are. So, easier movement of these ideas might benefit both.",1443070535

My <i>guess</i> is that they are set up right next to the sea so that they can do exactly what they did in Fukushima -- pump sea water into the reactor.<p>Naturally higher ground is actually hard to find near the sea (because the mountains are usually set back by about a kilometre from the sea).  Also, if you perch yourself on a cliff next to the sea, then you are at a more serious risk of landslides during the <i>many</i> 6-7 magnitude earthquakes we have in Japan each year.  With artificially higher ground, I suspect you would be at even more risk.<p>The other main reason for not putting a nuclear reactor on high ground is that in the event of a containment breach, the contaminated water will run downhill (in indescriminate directions).  The placement in low ground next to the ocean may be the best place, environmentally, in the case of a disaster.<p>Again, I&#x27;m only guessing, but I&#x27;m sure if you ask someone who is trained in the field they can give you better answers.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that Japan will transition away from nuclear reactors in the middle term.  There is enough geothermal potential to provide base load (though protecting the environment with all the earthquakes we have here is not trivial in that case either).  Since Fukushima, the amount of solar panels being installed in my area is insane, so I&#x27;m hopeful that things will improve over the next 50 years or so.<p>(Having said all that, Hamaoka power plant, which is just down the road from me, is perched up on top of a cliff overlooking the sea ;-) ).",1443070317

It&#x27;s an unconditional love, one that comes without strings attached or any expectation of greatness beyond the miracle of that child&#x27;s very existence. Tough love, sometimes, but not necessarily contingent. The trick is to find a way to give that to yourself. It takes time.<p>Procrastination, like other problems of self-improvement, is multilayered. Some of my friends who constantly agonize over their productivity levels confound me, because often from my vantage point they seem perfectly well adjusted, if not for the constant feeling like they should be doing more.

That is what I call mathematical- vs. cognitive-abstraction. They are not the same thing, and in the case of programming languages, only the latter matters. A mathematical abstraction is simply the naming of a pattern; a cognitive abstraction is <i>a human</i> solving a problem by explicitly thinking of said pattern. The former is either true or false; the latter is either useful or not (and the utility is completely orthogonal to any mathematical considerations).<p>> I appreciate your explanation but again it fails to actually show it being useful outside of the context of working around Haskell&#x27;s strict type system<p>I think it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> useful as a cognitive abstraction (and the problem isn&#x27;t Haskell&#x27;s type system, but its purity from effects). I believe that monads as a cognitive abstraction are foreign and harmful to imperative languages, which have an equally-powerful cognitive abstraction -- the thread -- that fits much better with the rest of the language&#x27;s abstractions and <i>I think</i> is much more useful for most people.",1443069777

It seems like yet another thing that people observed what Google was doing, and then implementing it wrong.<p>Google is using containers instead of VMs. This still provides security isolation and allows them to use resources more efficiently (VM has overhead where you need a whole OS for every instance).<p>This approach does not make much sense in public cloud, where you already run inside of VM and the overhead is really for Amazon not you. So I see Docker is now pivoting to be a package manager, but there are already tools that do that. You can argue that Docker is simpler but so was rpm when it started. As Docker will grow it will become more complex in order to support all functionality package format already provides. There might be an argument that you can run multiple Docker containers on a single host, but that&#x27;s what processes are for.<p>There is change happening, and looks like cloud companies want to create &quot;cloud os&quot;, I guess Docker is step toward that direction, but at current state in don&#x27;t see it offering anything valuable to the organization that uses it.",1443069620

In the future it will be better for things made of some composites, but at the end of the day there are so many necessary processes and materials to create physical objects that 3D printing will always apply to niche objects.

They will all behave in chaotic and unpredictable ways.  The only way to make sense of why people exchange is to make the assumption that each participant in the exchange gains something greater than what they give up.

You can only infer or measure the subset of those, and make observations.  Utility is the abstract class of individual preference implementations.

It doesn&#x27;t.<p>Open source software doesn&#x27;t suffer the tragedy of the commons precisely because the utility contributors gain can only be upwardly increased by people using it, and overconsumption of the software has very little effect on the utility of the producers.

The problem is that the Linux kernel API is huge and privilege escalation bugs are found all the time. In order to make a container secure, you need to disable 95% of this API, e.g. using seccomp, not mounting /proc or /sys, drastically limiting /dev, etc. Sandstorm.io hasn&#x27;t seen a single working breakout since we started keeping track over a year ago, despite numerous Linux kernel exploits going by in that time, because all the bugs have been in features that we turned off.<p><a href=""https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-practices/#server-sandboxing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-prac...</a><p>That said, there is a cost in compatibility.

You absolutely can have python 2 and 3 side by side, or even different minor versions. And with virtualenv or pyvenv (that came with 3.4) you can even have multiple installation of the sane version. If you add setuptools to your application you can easily generate single file package (I personally like wheel) the deployment is as simple as writing pip install myawesomeapp-1.0.py2.py3.whl it downloads all dependencies.

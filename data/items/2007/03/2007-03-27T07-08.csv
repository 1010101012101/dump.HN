""when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.""<p>Brad Feld, the all knowing VC prophet, left Mobius Capital after Mobius cratered and now he's trolling for scraps  with ""borrowed"" equipment. He used to do deals for millions and now he's throwing $10Ks around.

But the other way to read it is as a validation of the vision behind YC.  The new model for startup investment that you all have pioneered is clearly in line with the current trajectory of innovation on the internet.  You figured it out first -- everyone reading this knows that -- and it almost seems like it'd be MORE worrisome if other investors didn't jump on the same bandwagon right about now.<p>I mean, at the end of the day, ""who's committed and who's merely involved?"" -- as Dharmesh put it -- is a pretty damn important thing to know when making the decision to invest in a team.  Is it <i>that</i> surprising that other investors are asking the same question?<p>Point is, techstars just proves that you guys are on to something.  And, considering the growing buzz around YC -- not to mention the rockstars who post here at news.yc, speak at your events, and contributed to Jessica's book -- well, seems like Harry Potter's got a pretty serious first-mover advantage.  =)",1174979288

I wouldn&#x27;t see it as my responsibility, and as far as the competitive aspect goes, I don&#x27;t necessarily think that it would be advantageous in the long-run.  Calling them out strikes me as a chance for some short-term gain in a way that I would personally find distasteful, if not unethical.<p>I agree with the sentiment of &quot;reach our to your competitor privately, inform them of the problem, and suggest they fix it&quot;.  They may be your competitor, but they probably aren&#x27;t Satan incarnate, and they&#x27;ll probably be grateful, and building that relationship may actually be beneficial down the road.<p>Look at the history with Peter Thiel and Elon Musk before they merged their respective companies.  They were competitors, yes.  But if either had chosen to make things personal and go into full on attack mode, they might never have merged, we would not have gotten Paypal, and Peter and Elon probably wouldn&#x27;t be billionaires now.   To be fair, you can argue whether or not it&#x27;s a Good Thing that we have Paypal, but from their subjective perspective, it was better that they were on good enough terms to have the merger conversation.",1420153099

If so, I assume that all those detectors, displays, etc. already work to sufficient extent)<p>Reading <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/31/new-u-s-stealth-jet-can-t-fire-its-gun-until-2019.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/31/new-u-s-ste...</a>, the plane carries so few bullets that it may be necessary to make its shots count, but even that shouldn&#x27;t be that hard that it takes years and years to develop the software to shoot a gun.<p>Caveat: I know next to nothing about what the U.S.A. expects these guns to do or what they can do. My model of what a gun does is &quot;spew out lead when the pilot presses a button&quot;, with very few refinements. A video camera that stops shooting when the original target goes out of range and a friend-or-foe detector input that stops shooting, would be nice additions, but since the missile system works. I would guess that the &#x27;interfacing with a variety of NATO weapon systems&#x27; part shouldn&#x27;t be that hard for the gun part of the plane&#x27;s software. Or are these guns almost auto-firing and do they want to shoot at enemy vehicles that are in close combat with friendly forces, and only hit enemies? Maybe even have the gun control steering of the airplane (target turns left, please follow, so that I can keep firing)? That would seriously complicate matters.<p>Or is this a matter of bureaucracy in action in that this module missed a shipping deadline and now has to wait for the next software release for the entire plane that will come in 2019?",1420152971

I&#x27;d say the probability is very high of that. An overwhelmed founder IMO may be a sweet acquisition target. If he knows he is in over his head, maybe he would be happy to sell you his company for terms you can accept. You&#x27;ll get all the customers, and you&#x27;ll also know those customers are in your good care.<p>If you whack him upside the head with a report to Visa, MC, etc. he&#x27;ll fix it and continue to be ignorant or negligent in all the other ways he is failing to adequately serve his customer base.<p>Lastly, and please know I am not accusing you of a nefarious plot here. But anyone reading this will see the potential prize of acquiring a competitor&#x27;s client base. I want to dispel the myth that a report would be a fatal blow to his company that would result in your company ending up with all his customers. His merchant bank who is really on the hook for his PCI compliance will not terminate his account over a first offense. They will instead make even more money off him by imposing remediation consulting. And if those expenses were to put him out of business, there would still be an acquisition cost in reaching his customers, letting them know that your company exists and selling them on your solution.<p>My general approach to life: I do my best to limit my actions to those that will enhance or maintain the quality of my reflection in the mirror.",1420152956

For example, the competitor could accuse you to have came across this information illegally (whether you did or not in the eyes of the law is irrelevant: once you&#x27;re faced with a lawsuit, your best likely outcome is that you will only have to pay your lawyer&#x27;s bills); or, they could think you&#x27;re preemptively covering your ass before starting a smear campaign against them, and beat you to the punch with accusations and threats of their own, and so on.<p>On the other hand, as some have pointed out, this is a good marketing opportunity for you—you just need to be careful how you use the information. I would, however, avoid making _any_ references to competitors (even indirectly by referring to “our competitors”), because you don&#x27;t want to be petty, and you also don&#x27;t want to ever have to answer the question “Who are these competitors of yours?” in front of a court stenographer.<p>You do not mention if the PCI violations could flow through to your competitor&#x27;s clients; are the credit cards those that customers use to pay for the competitor&#x27;s SaaS, or are they stored on behalf of customers to provide the service itself (e.g.: the way, say, Stripe stores your customers card data for you)? A breach that leaks credit card data in this case would be catastrophic not just for you, but for your customers as well—and these are consequences that have a material impact on the quality of your product over your competitors&#x27;.<p>From a marketing viewpoint, keep in mind that the value this piece of intel is also likely to be proportional to the sophistication of a prospective customer. A potential large client that could is more likely to be sensitive to something like PCI than small fish, and knowing that you can plant the bug in their ear that your competitors might not be as up-to-date on PCI as you are could make the difference between a sale and a missed opportunity.",1420152862

8824634,comment,8823487,8823971,0,0,Kalium,,,"> In the last 100 years especially, religious people have grown anti-science, largely because we see science growing increasingly atheistic.<p>If I may have a moment? I want to discuss this comment. For a very long time, many people rooted their faith in mystery. Nobody knows how the weather works, therefore God does it. That sort of thinking was very commonplace.<p>Science has always been &quot;atheistic&quot; in that God has never been a coherent part of any scientific system. It&#x27;s difficult to account for an uncontrollable and omnipotent force, after all. Nothing there has changed in centuries. What has changed in that science has advanced enough to pull away the mysteries that used to be attributed to God.<p>Ever hear the phrase &quot;God of the gaps&quot;? For a lot of people, that was - and is - how they understand God. Anything they didn&#x27;t understand, that was God. Science was just something those rich eggheads did.<p>Over time, it became possible to see the material world in which we live as comprised of matter and energy that are governed by natural laws. It was no longer necessary to see God in everything you didn&#x27;t understand. The human body wasn&#x27;t divinely created in its current form, we&#x27;re the product of millennia of evolution.<p>To a great many people, whose primary understanding of divinity is that of a God of the gaps, knowledge and faith are fundamentally incompatible. If they acquired knowledge, the unknowns on which their faith rests will vanish and their faith be shaken.<p>I suppose this is a very long-winded way of saying that I don&#x27;t perceive science as becoming more atheistic over time. I perceive religion as being in a slow, painful retreat from territory it never should have occupied.",1420152568
8824633,comment,8823760,8823760,0,0,dctoedt,,,"1. FALSE ADVERTISING:  If the competitor <i>advertises</i> PCI compliance --- or even advertises &quot;we&#x27;re secure&quot; --- that&#x27;s very possibly false advertising in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act [1] and perhaps various state deceptive-trade-practices statutes.  Some years back, U-Haul got a $44 million judgment against a competitor whose ads for rental trucks included inaccurate dimensions.  The damages award was tied to the cost of corrective advertising that U-Haul would theoretically have to do. [2]<p>2.  TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE COUNTERCLAIM:  The competitor&#x27;s terms of service with the customer probably include restrictions on access to the competitor&#x27;s system.  The competitor thus might claim that the OP&#x27;s accessing of the customer&#x27;s data constituted &quot;tortious interference&quot; with the competitor-customer contract. [3]  The competitor&#x27;s lawyers are likely to pursue such a claim, because it lets them reframe the issue in their favor, it might allow them greater discovery from the OP, and it could also lead to a punitive-damages award.  (Whether a tortious-interference claim would <i>succeed</i> depends on a lot of facts that we don&#x27;t have.)<p>3.

They&#x27;re not. They feel that way because it&#x27;s you experiencing them, but they&#x27;re not. Because privilege.<p>I bared my soul once to a group of feminists on a private message board, and got a similar reaction. And after a lot of self-inquiry, came to understand what is meant by privilege. It&#x27;s a tough thing to internalize, but I think it&#x27;s important to.<p>Privilege, in Scott&#x27;s case, means you get an escape hatch thrown to you. Later on down the line, society itself pulls you out of the dumps because society wants and needs you, a white man, to solve their problems for them. As bad as it is when you&#x27;re young and rudderless, society itself wants you to succeed. So you will receive success, on your terms, despite how bad it seems right now.<p>For those without privilege, there is no escape except what you manage to claw from the world by hook or by crook. You need the support network, you need the help of the like-minded. If you don&#x27;t manage to find the support, and you&#x27;re not mentally wired to do whatever it takes to succeed, you&#x27;re fucked. Forced to fit your life into whatever little box society expects you to fit in. To be what other people want you to be instead of what you want to be.<p>Going through life as a minority means that when you have the sorts of problems Scott has, you don&#x27;t get to get over it. Society deems that you deserve to have these problems, that you&#x27;re not worth fixing.<p>What feminists want is not for you to give up privilege, you can&#x27;t. They just want you to acknowledge the fact that you&#x27;re privileged. That you don&#x27;t have to work so hard for it. That is what the movement has decided is the next step towards healing the rift.<p>The feminism movement knows what it&#x27;s doing. There are very smart people who&#x27;ve learned the lessons of social struggle from way back in the seventies who are carefully crafting the philosophies aimed at fixing that inborn tendency of human beings to subjugate the out-group.<p>Simply understanding and acknowledging the full extent of privilege is all that&#x27;s being asked of you. It&#x27;s tough. It requires hard conversations and personal inquiry on the part of all people, not just males, not just white people.<p>Scott didn&#x27;t acknowledge it, and so invoked the full wrath of the feminist movement. Not saying he deserved it, but that&#x27;s where it ultimately stems.",1420151116

This does admittedly get dicey at times.<p>If the intent of the attack is direct attrition against an enemy force and supporting infrastructure, then it&#x27;s guerilla warfare, even if most of the victims are civilians due to poor planning, bad information, etc. This may get particularly tricky in the case of suicide bombings in Israel - since virtually the entire country is part of the reserves, you could make the argument that any attack is an attack against the military infrastructure. I&#x27;d say that for it to be legitimate guerilla warfare, there must be at least a vaguely plausible plan for success. In the case of suicide bombings in Israel, they would then have to have a plan of killing the entire population of the country as a way of ending the fight, and their tactics would have to be a plausible way to carry that out. I don&#x27;t think it fits that definition, so that would make it terrorism.<p>2 and 3 are ordinary warfare IMO, because they are both done by states and have the intent of attacking enemy forces. They may or may not be done with flimsy information, and the state in question and the militant group they are fighting against may both be in violation of assorted laws of war under various legal systems, but it&#x27;s still conventional warfare.",1420151008

I&#x27;ll extend that to add that, in the interest of consumers the auto industry ought to arrive at a common standard for docking stations.  All this Tesla stuff is neat but it does not allow for ideas such as docking stations at mall parking lots (charge while you shop) or even at work.<p>This is where, again, the humble charge cord wins again: It is far easier to agree on a common connector than to design a docking system that will work with all cars for the next 50 years.  In many ways this is not unlike all cars using a refueling port that is compatible with the nozzles at all gas stations.<p>With a common charge cord and connector design one could imagine a future where malls intall charge stations in a selected number of charging parking spots, even as profit centers.  Companies could provide similar benefits to their employees either for free or paid.<p>Thinking through this argument makes me conclude that electric cars might not truly mature until charging mechanisms are standardize to the extent that they are compatible with any electric car or truck produced.<p>Tesla can do whatever they want, of course, yet the fact remains that if I buy a BMW and my wife a Tesla we will have two completely different charging systems to contend with rather than one.

What dangers do you mean?<p>There were still social conventions in 19th century England demanding lip service to religion, but I don&#x27;t have the impression that they demanded devoutness (which is an inner condition and not something that can be enforced in any case), nor that they still put intellectuals in physical danger.<p>As with social conventions nowadays, people could usually tell who the true believers were as opposed to who was merely following the what-you-can&#x27;t-say rules.

But, it kind of scares me that they in one sentence say that they will &quot;make our cultural treasures accessible to everyone. Forever.&quot; and in the next one asks for money to make it happen. &quot;Forever&quot; is a bold statement and I can&#x27;t be the only one that sees a contradiction in this. I guess what they&#x27;re saying is: if the money runs out the data will disappear.<p>I&#x27;ve worked closely with archivists and preservationists in the cultural heritage sector and I know that to keep the sacred promise of saving something for an eternity you have to have strategies for what you save in the first place. However, I don&#x27;t see a clear strategy with the IA. The Internet Archive (not the Wayback Machine part of it) is basically a site where I can upload whatever digital litter I like as long as it&#x27;s not protected by copyright and they (without questions asked) store it &quot;forever&quot;. It&#x27;s fantastic in a sense. But is it sustainable in the long run?<p>For the the Wayback Machine I can force a snapshot of a site whenever I like and as often as I please. I stumbled across the snapshot for this page today [ <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140415000000*/http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20140415000000*/http://www.econo...</a> ] and I think it illustrates what I&#x27;m trying to say.

I guess people where trigger happy with the &quot;Save Page Now&quot; [ <a href=""https://archive.org/web/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/web/</a> ] feature when the article got publicity. Could it perhaps be a better idea to snapshot at certain times and find smart algos that can detect important changes in the page?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear some replies to my criticism.

I was definitely not individually targeted, and definitely did not make any of the usual novice mistakes.  Since the Synology NAS systems are commonly used as backups for small and medium-level enterprises, they were (and are) exceptionally high value targets.  In my case, I had a root exploit in the OS that allowed all kinds of malware to be installed by anyone who cared to scan the Internet at large for systems on port 5000.<p>Most of the publicity centered around trojan miner applications, but the same issue also exposed the entire file system.  So, searching the exposed file systems for wallet.dat files was a trivial and obvious free lunch for the crackers, much more so than mining.<p>In retrospect, I think the biggest mistake was using the same port for things like the security camera server that is used for remote administration.  Taking the time to learn how to use a nonstandard port would probably have kept this particular system safe.  I can&#x27;t blame Synology, really... just a bad threat assessment on my part.  My thinking was that keeping the wallet.dat file off of any Internet-accessible Windows boxes would provide enough &quot;security by obscurity,&quot; but we all know how that story usually ends.",1420149762

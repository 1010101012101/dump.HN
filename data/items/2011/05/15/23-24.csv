You should demonstrate your loyalty by giving your company a full two weeks notice when you leave.<p>You're being taken advantage of, and you know it or you wouldn't have posted this.  You're taking an under-market salary and no benefits, which means you're probably making about 50% of what you should be when you count health care, 401k and so forth.  You have no equity, which is the traditional tradeoff at a startup: Accept a reduced salary for the possibility of a large payoff at the end.<p>Right now, your <i>best case scenario</i> is that the company is wildly successful, the founders go on to fame and fortune, and if you're very, very lucky, they might just decide to throw you a bone.

She had an iPhone, and was clearly very very non-technical. When asked if she had jailbroken her phone, she didn't even know what that /meant/, and when I explained to her that I had developed ""Cydia"", she hadn't heard of it.<p>However, later in the conversation, she started mentioning how much she hated AT&T, and was glad she was using T-Mobile, at which point I realized that all this time I had not been asking users enough questions. I asked her if she was, in fact, using T-Mobile on her iPhone, and then answer was ""yes"": she had bought her phone from an unlock parlor.<p>After a few more questions like ""do you have a brown icon on your phone that looks somewhat like the App Store?"", I realized that she in fact had a jailbroken/unlocked iPhone with Cydia installed on it (and she had even used it a couple times), but was simply not technical enough to recognize that state using any of the terms that I normally have access to while conversing.",1305503313

I'd put your resume out there and see what bites you get.<p>* What is preventing you from bringing these issues up with the management directly, vs. posting on HN?<p>Not having equity NOW is a big red flag, as are the communication issues with the team.  Substandard salary and health care is forgivable in certain stages of a company, but only if you have substantial equity.<p>I think based on your answers to the above, you'll know what you want to do.  If you do decide to stay, you should make it a positive negotiation with your management about wanting more visibility into the business side (so you can contribute more), and to get at least the equity part resolved now.<p>IMO with no other data, if you live in the Bay Area or are willing to relocate, your best bet is probably to find a new job with a winning team.  Assuming this was an early career move for you (full stack involvement with a company which may or may not be doomed), it's probably worth taking a role in a well-run engineering organization and business for a while to see how THAT works (Palantir, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Quora, ... even pockets at Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.), and maybe then try to get a cofounder or full early tech hire (with equity, etc.) at a funded startup.

It feels like the movie is trying to make some kind of point about free will, but it's not only keeping its thumb on the scale, it's also keeping its other thumb on the other side of the scale, making the discussion pointless. Free will is nonexistent, it says, because of this hypothetical device which could never exist in the real world. Except, oh wait, the device doesn't work because there's free will.

Early employees are typically given large amounts of equity <i>in lieu of</i> a market salary and benefits --- because the company hasn't got the money to pay market rates yet.  There's ordinarily no need to wait for profitability, or even for funds to be available (beyond what's required to pay for the legal paperwork).  And even without fully worked up contracts, it's still possible to at least have a written arrangement of how equity will be divided and up as and when things are formalized.<p>So, if you're getting below-market rates <i>and</i> no equity, well... at the very least, that's unusual.

As more Bitcoin infrastructure springs up (more banks, more verification hubs, more incentive on transaction fees rather than mining, when mining gets too expensive) then these problems will be organically mitigated.

I went to CMU '02, then lived in Shadyside for a few years, miss the place dearly and own a few properties there (they have appreciated significantly over the past 5 years... Pittsburgh has been an amazing real estate market during that time). Part of the reason it has appreciated is that it's doing exceptionally well during this downturn. Unemployment is 7.4%, almost 2 points lower than the nations average. San Francisco's is 10%.<p>Smart young successful people actually do live there, more so than it's comparison cities... It also has some of the most educated folks in that bunch-\n<a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~cbriem/SelectedTables2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pitt.edu/~cbriem/SelectedTables2.htm</a> \nYou'll see it's in very good company among the top educated cities. Personally, a lot of my friends stayed in Pittsburgh and/or moved back after a few years. I personally was itching to leave many years ago, have lived in many places along the way and now miss the place dearly/will at some point move back.<p>There are a number of startups in Pittsburgh now, but not as many as there were during the .com bubble... there are many more than any other cities of its size, primarily because there is great talent coming out of CMU and Pitt. Your argument suggests that there is no reason for anyone to not locate to SV (which is totally fine, but I think many would disagree)<p>Here are some of the recent startups: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-hot-software-or-recent-startups-in-Pittsburgh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-hot-software-or-recent-sta...</a><p>and some others: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-startups-out-of-Pittsburgh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-startups-out-of-Pitt...</a><p>Re: food, you must be joking... Murray Ave right by CMU has more fantastic ethnic restaurants than anywhere I can think of (<a href=""http://www.urbanspoon.com/n/23/2226/Pittsburgh/Squirrel-Hill-CMU-restaurants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbanspoon.com/n/23/2226/Pittsburgh/Squirrel-Hill...</a>), and Nine on Nine, Eleven, Paris 66, Salt of the Earth, and Bona Terra would be worthy of Michelin stars in another city, yet they are reasonably priced in Pittsburgh.<p>Re: weather you're spot-on... there are less sunny days in Pittsburgh than nearly anywhere... but it seems to work out OK for Seattle.<p>If this fund is indeed run by a bunch of bureaucrats it might end up being crap, as you suggest.

2551011,story,,,4,8,JoshKalkbrenner,"Ask HN: Should we kill our site?",,"Back in April, we asked the HN community for feedback. We received great advice and have since enhanced/modified our site per the feedback. However, we're now at the cross roads of Continue or Kill it.<p>So here's our situation:<p>Initially, we wanted a way to quickly and anonymously voice our (infamous bank) frustrations. There's alway the fake twitter account, but we enjoy coding so we spent a few hours one night, and the next morning we launched MyBankSux.com. \nIt received a few complaints, so we added banks in other countries to see whether anyone else would use it.<p>We received 80 + complaints in the past month, so no traction, and now that the 1 month mark has passed - we need to choose whether to invest additional time or simply leave it as is.<p>If we choose to invest additional time, we want to create the easiest way to submit a bank complaint. We want the user to simply pull up the application (mobile), click submit, and have the banks' customer service contact them; no more hold, nor need to find the customer service number. In addition, we want to keep track of resolution so consumers can quickly identify banks that provide stellar customer service.<p>Much like Gri.pe pulls up a list of local entities, we want MyBankSux to pull up a list of local banks or allow you to enter by name. Unlike Gri.pe, we don't want everyone to see our names when we have a complaint; like showing your friends who bitches the most. Although Twitter is great for bitching, not all banks are on twitter, and identifying the handle of those that are on twitter is difficult; for most banks.<p>So, I ask... what are your thoughts? Should we kill it, or should we continue. If continue, what should we tackle first?<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.",1305500553

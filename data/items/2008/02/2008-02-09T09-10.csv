I thought it was intended to demonstrate how easy it is to implement multi-page flows in Arc by binding closures to links and forms. I didn't think it was intended to convince people that Arc is a good general purpose language because its scope was so narrow (if the challenge were to build a search engine or an image editing tool, it would have been a different story).<p>By the way, although I didn't expect people to extrapolate from the Erlang challenge that Erlang is a good general purpose too, I do think that it is, at least for building backends for a wide range of applications. I wrote a followup on my blog to the Erlang challenge where I listed some of them.",1202550992

Instead of obfuscating JavaScript try spending your time to make the whole thing look as great as you can. Developing something like _Basecamp_ is easy but I doubt something as simple as Basecamp will be a success again--unless you improve it by an order of magnitude.",1202550873

112654,comment,111841,112203,0,0,olavk,,,"It should be noted that the released version of Arc actually <i>did</i> support Unicode. The <i>only</i> reason that it became a controversy was because PG said it was ASCII-only and implied it was a design decision. It is purely a communication issue.<p>(Btw. same thing with the controversy over presentational markup vs CSS. AFAICT the Arc framework don't do any layout at all out of the box, including any presentational markup.)<p>Now PG seem to believe that controversy is inevitable when creating a new language so you might as well throw a few random punches. However if you want to build a vibrant community around a language I think it is very important to choose you battles carefully and your swipes wisely.",1202550712

SETI@Home leverages... (wait for it)... the desktop!<p>Second, the point here is not about utility computing.  It's about developing applications.  Let's face it, web apps are struggling to the the things that most desktop apps do easily.  (Ajax is a joke.)  Certainly they both have their pros and cons.  And there are certainly some situations where a web app makes more sense.  Don't get me wrong.  But when creating rich applications, the web sucks.  And all your arguing here won't change that.",1202548830

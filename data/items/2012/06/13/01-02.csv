IPO's, incubators/accelerators, and the spillover of excitement from SV to NYC/LA/Seattle/Boston is pretty evident that big money goes where it needs to go.<p>It's more so that there isn't -enough- VC out there today, in my opinion, that's really driving crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. Now that the barrier to entry has dipped so low (technical costs) and the need for innovation is so big, that there just is too much consumer demand to get involved with the game. Up until the JOBS Act, to play ball you had to enter the field as an entrepreneur. No one really takes money anymore from someone who hasn't had skin in the game (whether from a successful startup of failed investment).<p>I like to think of it as thirsty kids at a summer concert, where VC's were the big scary macho bouncers who threw out water bottles to a select few in the front. Only, now, there's more thirsty people than ever and the concert organizers just brought over a firetruck.",1339552737

A company might be happy to pay a royalty on a patent but as it is now patent law allows a patent holder to prevent anyone from making or using a patented invention - in other words they could sue Maya directly for infringement. Music copyright law, which issues from the exact same clause in the constitution as patent law,  provides for a compulsory license of any song. A band knows before hand exactly how much it will cost to ""cover"" someone's song.<p>If you are found to be infringing a patent your financial exposure is almost un-bounded.  If there were a compulsory license provision in patent law like their is in music copyright, companies would know exactly how much they were risking if found to be infringing a patent",1339552505

My reply was in response to vacuum tubes over sea level. Right now we can't even have floating tubes anchored to the sea ground yet; storm waves rip every anchor we can build apart (it has been tried for wave power generators).<p>Vacuum tubes could probably be built deeper down where the waves aren't strong. I actually think that earthquakes wouldn't necessarily be a problem at that level, since everything would have to be quite flexible anyway. In order to elevate security, I could imagine making tube sectors detachable and having safety shutters. This way, if one sector is breached it could be sealed and detached such that it floats to sea level. The train could even be inside if you can control the pressure differences well enough to not kill everyone inside (something that is well understood for jet planes).",1339552408

Sure, I want my companies to behave in morally responsible ways. On the other hand, there are hundreds of other ways to save and improve lives. If we wanted the companies we invest in to maximize quality of life improvement we would get <i>much</i> further providing vaccinations or microloans to the third world where owning an iPad is as much a pipe dream as winning the lottery (per unit money, energy, whatever). If we want larger public access to scientific advances, perhaps we should fund more public science? Or, we should change the way patents work (2).<p>(2) This to me seems like a very reasonable question. Aside from patent wars that might hurt your favorite smartphone os vendor, there are real concerns. Drug companies are incentivized to create substances and methodologies that drastically improve the quality and duration of lives in both first and third world countries. On the other hand, intellectual property protection for drugs (until they become generics) does cost lives. But we shouldn't forget just how powerful those incentives are. All the awesome research done in university laboratories (one of which I work in) is nothing without the ability to take a drug from ""lab-rat plausible"" to ""market-ready"". Certainly patents don't exist to facilitate personal wealth. But just because they do generate wealth doesn't mean that their intended goal has been forgotten, short-term losses notwithstanding.<p>Even if we answered (1) and found PRC or Apple to be morally culpable, it misses the larger issue: if society feels that this girl, or others who benefit from patented technology should be allowed to use it, someone's got to pay. Either it's the companies and their investors (the obvious point: not just rich folks), or it's taxpayers through some form of state-sponsored licensing (edit: or some other state-funded mechanism).

Except that they're not really virtual machines, nor are they EC2 instances.  Read Only Chroot Jails plus Precompiled Application, Libraries, and Environment (ROCJPALEs?) They also have a pretty complex set of support structures that provide connectivity to databases and other resources. Perhaps someone can suggest an existing name for that, but I know of none.<p>Instead of ""manifold"", perhaps they could use the word ""cluster"".  Except it's not really a cluster, it's a set of distributed clusters. And nodes in a cluster are typically machines.  The nodes in the dyno manifold aren't machines, virtual machines, they're ROCJPALEs.  You could use the word ""array"", but again, it's not really an array. It's a multi-layered, geographically distributed structure of co-hosted application jails.  ""Manifold"" seems as good a term as any.<p>""Streaming"" seems like a good word. It's specifically relevant to this incident... they describe how the API is not atomic; that each message is built on top of the previous entries, and the data structures are implicit in the stream.  That sounds like the definition of ""streaming"" to me.<p>""API"" seems like a widely accepted term. They could've described it as a ""protocol"", perhaps.  But neither seems more jargony than the other.<p>""Data""... well I suppose ""streaming API"" without the data would work.  But it serves to differentiate it from a streaming video protocol.<p>""Mesh"" has a very specific meaning.  It means that you have a set of nodes that are connected peer-to-peer and that messages travel through the network by hopping from node to node.

What would you call that instead of routing?<p>I feel like people who object to this kind of language are the same folks who object to the word ""cloud"".

Tugging on people's heart strings to push forward your philosophy/beliefs/ideas is a cheap ploy as old as time and it works because a story like this totally derails your ability to think rationally.<p>I wasn't clear on if the author of this piece was simply telling her tale of how the patent system had a profoundly negative impact on her and her family's lives or if it was meant to push ideas about patent reform or both.

If you want to empathize with people on either side of an issue then you're also free to do that too.  One thing you cannot do, however, is both at the same time. Again, I have to reiterate that I'm totally on this mother's side. I have to keep repeating that because that's what these stories do!

4103816,comment,4102248,4102805,7,0,cheatercheater,,,"I don't have access to Kahneman's full paper to scrutinize (yet - I'm asking around) but it seems possible to me that they wanted to place themselves in opposition to the general practices of education at the time. Notice that since his work began, education has changed drastically, several times over. Several examples of approaches tried are the classical lecture being jotted down to study at home; study groups with two-way communication; exam preparation; test preparation; collaborative group work; coaching; a specialist could go on.<p>Bear in mind that 50 years ago the SAT was still in flux and a lot of it was being experimented with and new. Given that it was one of the biggest, and most repeatedly renewed concerns for researchers like Kahneman, there's little to doubt he's not only an expert on the SAT, but also knows as many of its downsides as anyone.<p>Therefore, I believe this paper is a sort of ""lessons learned"" story which shows that his approach is better than the form of education being undertaken by schools.<p><p>I find it ESPECIALLY curious that neither the article nor anyone in this whole thread (and have I tried reading most of it) has commented on the process, and consequences, of being caught on trick questions like bat and ball.<p>It is my understanding that our intelligence has evolved through use in situations where its impact was more or less immediately visible, and where this feedback could be acted upon.<p>Example: shaping tools. Is the flint stone sharp? No. Mash it against rocks. Is it sharp now? It's a bit sharper, but not sharp enough. Mash it against rocks some more. Is it sharp enough now? OK, you're done shaping your spear head.<p>Example: hunting. Approach the prey. It runs away. You don't notice why, you hadn't taken wind into account when looking for clues. No feedback, therefore you couldn't act upon it.<p>Example: hunting. Approach the prey. It runs away. You notice it did after wind turned and gave away your position. You got feedback from the grass and leaves moving in the wind. Next time you'll be able to act upon this.<p>Example: trying to shake fruit off a tree. You find a low-hanging branch and try to shake it. First you try this way, then that way, and finally you find the best way to get fruit without making too much fall down.<p>The last example extends to any sort of experimenting, tinkering, happy-hacking.<p>It is however notable that the bat and ball question does not test that. There's a question, and you give an answer. There's no feedback before it becomes final, and once it does that is the clear cut-off. This represents the stone-cold, immovable, monolithic machinery displayed by many technical subjects, such as science, mathematics, and some forms of computer programming, but also strategy, and some forms of art. There is no iterative process, you get one try, based on which you can in no way build a tangible mental model of how something works and what parameters of your thinking you need to adjust in order to better yourself. One very stupid example is when someone in a job interview asks you about standard library function names and argument orders. Either you remember, or you don't. I'll call this feedback the <i>feedback gap</i>.<p>Bear in mind I have mentioned ""happy-hacking"" above and ""computer programming"" below. In fact, they're both computer programming. The difference? If I'm presented with a python program where I can use an iterative process, a repl, and its help() command that immediately gives me access to documentation, then I can very easily build up a mental model of what's going on. Exceptions and errors give me constant, constructive feedback which comes immediately. This immediacy is extremely important and even a slight delay makes the learning process slower. Additionally, if some things aren't available as immediate feedback, I can find out. For example, when trying to get at the fruit, I saw immediately where the fruit was in the tree branches. When typing out python, I don't have this, I don't see what the functions are, so I need to use help(). That works well enough. Some people like intellisense for that. Works well too. It all fills the <i>feedback gap</i>.<p>There's a similar difference in ease of progress between experimental mechanics and similar physics, versus branches where experimentation cannot happen. That's <i>feedback gap</i> again.<p>It is my belief that this sort of immediate feedback is needed in other technical subjects, especially mathematics and physics. Approaches such as theorem provers are helpful in mathematics, but they're nowhere near being complete, and nowhere near the utility and immediacy of a repl. I am fairly sure there are other ways in which the <i>feedback gap</i> can be filled. Perhaps different methodology, or differently structured theories, can give us more immediate feedback? Perhaps mathematical systems in which theorems are easier to tentatively prove or disprove can become more successful in breeding new results?<p>Or perhaps the theories are not to blame, but we need more tools. For example, my abstract geometry teacher kept reminding us that we needed to come up with such quick checks. Non-linearities were always useful. His favourite was the binary distance function, which was 0 for two identical points and 1 for different points. A lot of stupid theorems can be disproved by checking some examples with this.<p>Can someone else comment on any such tools?<p>Writing this comment definitely came with an insight or two for me. If you read it, thanks for going on this trip with me.",1339550070

Given any empirical theory of consciousness, it's never going to be ""I get to live in the computer,"" just ""I die, but a copy of my brain lives in the computer."" And it's pretty hard to draw a bright line between that and ""I die, my brain slowly decays for thousands of years, then it's surgically reconstructed and awoken."" Still feels like death to me.<p>Of course, to your transhumanist theorist, there's probably just as much connection between me and the computer as there is between me in the night and me in the morning; it's all just an illusion created by a persistent brain state. But that doesn't help either, because now you're describing a kind of immortality -- ""This exact stream of continuous consciousness is a dead end, but something very like it will continue to be and think of itself as part of me and that gives me and it some comfort about the whole thing"" -- which the general public has been achieving quite successfully for some time in the form of <i>procreation</i>.<p>In fact, since every living organism represents a terminal link in a chain of unbroken life dating back to the first self-replicating molecule, it might be quite reasonable to say that we have all been alive for billions of years at least, we just don't remember most of it. But this is changing: I can go on Wikipedia today and recover the memories of our culture dating back for most of its existence.<p>Naturally, they grow vaguer the further they go back in time, as memories do; but for events that take place today, we have a record which far exceeds human memory in accuracy and exactness of fact, and which will very soon be competitive with it in emotional effect. It is quite realistic for me to expect to create a record of my life which has as much effect on my descendants in a hundred years as my own memories of today would have on me were I to live that long.<p>So I think it's possible the transhumanists missed the boat. Or rather, they're on the boat already and just don't realize it. The human macro-organism does, starting from now, seem to stand a decent chance of living to see the heat death of the universe.",1339549805

Anything covered by the patent is a potential source of licensing fees, simple as that.<p>I'm going to start thinking out loud here: Imagine patent holders are disallowed from directly exercising the techniques covered by their patents. Corporations that patent technology in their field essentially have to sell their patents to NPEs and license them back. The researching corporation gets an up-front return on their R&D investment (and a potential head start in implementing the new patents before the rest of the public actually sees them) and the public suffers none of the side effects of a government-granted monopoly.<p>The biggest wrinkle in a system like this would be the whole mess of submarine patents. If NPEs could be incentivised to make their patents broadly known, and approach licensees <i>before</i> they implement those patents, they could actually become a real value-ad to the system rather than a parasite: Imagine a one-stop shop where you could license a patent, get a reference implementation, and access experts who could help you apply that patent to your product.

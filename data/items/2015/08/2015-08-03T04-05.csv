Sending back every visited URL has never been ok for any reason, first time I saw this idea shot down was in &#x27;93.<p>But there might be a way out:<p>I&#x27;d be willing to give up privacy of URL hashes. This is how I&#x27;d do it:<p>- you already track a set of URLs that have discussions (I assume). If not, you need to figure out how to seed these. Volunteers, APIs....<p>- hash these URLs on server, and use a not-too-unique hash function. You want to end up with a high collision rate, but not too high.<p>- now, the client can query for conversations without revealing the URL it has visited:
  - ask server whether there are any conversations for a particular hash.
  - if server finds any, it returns { pageUrl: &#x27;&#x27;, conversationsUrls[]} 
  - now client can decide whether the url really matches, or it was just a random hash collision.<p>- I know this is not perfect. A privacy-busting determined enemy could generate hashes of large number of public sites and use statistics to infer what sites you&#x27;ve visited just from your hashes.

9993743,comment,9990758,9993479,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have a similar background, though in an obscure style of Japanese karate.  I can&#x27;t really comment on ground fighting since anyone with Japanese jiu-jitsu will wipe the floor with me (probably litterally ;-) ), but I can say something about striking.<p>I will probably start an argument, but a great deal of strength is unnecessary if you are trying to damage your opponent with strikes.  When I say &quot;damage&quot; I mean &quot;cause injury&quot;.  You want to deform your target so that it breaks.  To do so, you need speed, not strength.<p>Consider, for a moment, a glacier.  Because it is ridiculously massive, it has a huge amount of momentum as it creeps along at 5 cm per year.  A glacier can level mountains, but anyone can stand next it it and let it &quot;hit&quot; them with no damage.  That&#x27;s because it is moving very slowly and your body has plenty of time to adjust itself to any deformation the glacier will cause.<p>Now consider a bullet.  It has not even a fraction of the momentum of the glacier, but it can drill holes in you.  That&#x27;s because it is moving very quickly.  When it hits you, your body deforms and there is not enough time for it to adjust before it has deformed to the breaking point.<p>Another good analogy is Jello.  Put some Jello on a plate.  If you are careful, you can push the Jello around.  It deforms when you push on it, but then rebounds and moves backwards, bouncing back to its original shape.  If you push too quickly, though, there will not be enough time for it to rebound and you will create a hole.<p>Striking in fighting works the same way. There is not enough space in a comment to explain how to use this idea to strike optimally, but most people with good technique can seriously damage any human opponent.  Certainly any adult (whether male or female) that has trained for 10 years or so will be &quot;strong enough&quot;.<p>Strength is important in grappling and positioning an opponent.  It is also important when you are wearing pads designed to deaden the impact of a strike.  If the pads deform instead of the body, then if you want to knock someone out (for instance) you need to be very strong to physically move their brain case around.  Similarly, strength is important to push their muscles around to tire them.<p>Part of the problem is that in sport we are hoping to have a competition in which people compete but don&#x27;t unduly injure each other.  In such a situation, strength will certainly play a big role and so women are at a disadvantage.  If we were intending to see how fast we can injure our opponent (very possibly killing them in the process), then I think it levels the playing field considerably.<p>Jiu-jitsu is designed to constrain striking attacks so as to make them less dangerous, so possibly it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference anyway -- a very skilled striker may not get many opportunities before they are taken down.  However, I think we will never really know because I don&#x27;t think there is any way to be really effective in striking without intending to kill your opponent.  IMHO it is not a technique that lends itself well to sports (it is worth noting that the head of my style disagrees on this point!) I have also never seen an MMA fighter that strikes well (fast enough, choosing the correct targets, relaxed enough, etc).  I don&#x27;t think I ever will because such a fighter would injure too many people to get fights.",1438574916

9993731,comment,9993135,9993480,0,0,hackuser,,,"> Tyler Cowen writes in the WSJ, “ It isn&#x27;t clear that the estate tax raises much, if any, revenue. The very rich engage in tax-avoidance strategies. The apparent revenue raised is often offset by a lower intake from income and capital gains taxes. Furthermore, it has been estimated that the costs of implementing tax-avoidance strategies are roughly equal to the (gross) revenue raise.”<p>Cowen is merely repeating the talking points of the propaganda campaign against the estate tax planned in the mid-90s:<p><pre><code>  Yet in order to win over a specific audience to the issue,
  conservative discourse began to shift toward another frame,[1]
  as can be seen in important reports on the estate tax written by
  conservative analyst Bill Beach. Beach had been specifically
  brought to the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative
  think tank, thanks to funds raised by Alabama estate planner
  Harold Apolinsky, who formed the American Family Business
  Institute (AFBI) in 1992 to lobby against the estate tax. ...

  In a 1996 backgrounder ... [Beach] offered three main
  arguments for repeal: the estate tax is a diminishing source of
  revenue; it fails to achieve its purported goals of wealth
  redistribution; and the tax does more harm than good in lost
  productivity, lost jobs, and decreased revenue through other
  taxation.[2]
</code></pre>
As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Beach was also the source of the myth that small businesses and family farms were suffering from the tax, and the same campaign carefully developed the term &#x27;death tax&#x27;, which they credit with much of their success. Also, as mentioned elsewhere, the cited article will change forever how you read political commentary on any issue, as you realize that much of it, including by unwitting lay people, is parroting propaganda developed by special interests.<p>> ... even if this premise is not true (that there’d a positive net difference in the revenue raised), that’s assuming that the rich will maintain the same level of spending before they die, which may not be the case if they will get taxed on it when they die.<p>This seems very speculative. I&#x27;ve heard so many arguments with a similar argument: &#x27;don&#x27;t tax the wealthy or they will do X&#x27;. For example, the Reagan administration and others at the time argued that reducing taxes on the wealthy would increase their productive use of the funds, causing wealth to &#x27;trickle down&#x27; to everyone else. As it turned out, cutting taxes on the wealthy (and thereby relatively increasing the burden on everyone else) made the wealthy wealthier (surprise!), and everyone else&#x27;s income has been stagnent since then. The wealthy need to do their fair share and make the same sacrifice as everyone else; they are not a special case.<p>----<p>[1] &quot;frame&quot;, as in a way to &#x27;frame&#x27; an issue or debate<p>[2] &quot;Death and Taxes: Issue Framing and Conservative Coalition Maintenance&quot; by Richard Meagher:

There would be much less opposition to the H1B program if it were bringing in exclusively employees with, say, $150k+ compensation. It would be hard to argue those employees are undercutting salaries, except perhaps a few of the higher salaries. But there are a lot of $60k salaries on H1Bs, which seems a lot more suspicious. How scarce can a skill be if you&#x27;re only paying $60k for it?<p>As far as I can tell, a lot of the misuse comes from the enterprise/consulting space. Companies like Google seem to be <i>mostly</i> using the program as intended, bringing in high-end and highly paid talent. But there&#x27;s a weird corporate dance going on with &quot;solutions&quot; companies like IBM and Accenture, who subcontract through overseas outsourcing firms (sometimes derogatorily called &quot;body shops&quot;), who in turn use the H1B program to bring over some of their staff to the U.S. office to staff the contract. This use of the program looks more like undercutting wages than bringing in unusual, hard-to-find talent.<p>My pet solution to the problem is to prioritize quota slots by pay tiers, as a rough proxy for how rare the skills being sought really are.

Why did tech companies all of a sudden decide there was a shortage of knowledgeable and competent workers? I&#x27;m asking because throughout my career as a programmer I&#x27;ve worked with people from all sorts of backgrounds that have not had a traditional CS degree. They have come from fields like math, IT, physics, mechanical engineering, etc. Engineering disciplines but not really computer science.<p>The kind of work I&#x27;ve seen all those people do has also varied from things like control software for fields of heliostats to frameworks for server orchestrations to search and data mining. So how is it that I&#x27;ve managed to work with so many competent engineers and yet these giant corporations can&#x27;t figure out how to hire semi-competent engineers to do some of the drudge work that I&#x27;m sure they need done? Maybe the problem is not with the workforce and the availability of knowledgeable and competent workers? Maybe the problem is their shitty hiring practices?",1438574509

I find the &quot;this is defined only once in this function&quot; philosophy to be useful in keeping complexity down in Java programs.

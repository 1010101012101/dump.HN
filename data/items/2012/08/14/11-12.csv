I don't think that's ever a good idea - they signed up at a specific price and shouldn't be forced to change if they don't want to. That's how Server Density have implemented this change - it's for new signups only. Existing customers can move if they wish but they'll never be forced to.",1344945580

You know nothing about agriculture, but you see a minor set of stories and you think you're a fucking expert.<p>You have no idea if the diversified strategy has a higher expected value, or if it's just a variance play based on heat, or if different weather conditions could've affected interplay in a different way.  You have no idea what the crop insurances for different crops cost.  You have no idea what the weather forecasts were.<p>You literally know absolutely nothing about the matter.<p>All you know is that you've got an ideology and that you see absolutely everything through the ideas of your ideology, selectively perceiving, remembering and interpreting events to confirm and reconfirm your ideology.  And you're sufficiently arrogant that you think you can glance at a farm and know what tradeoffs they considered when they were planting their fields.<p>And that doesn't even get into the fact that if you travel via air around the globe, nearly all of the airlines are absolutely terrible, not just the subsidized ones in the US.

4380431,comment,4377972,4377972,1,0,timedoctor,,,"Seems like a pretty light innovation to me. I think a more important chat innovation is to know (for sure) if the person is actually online and working versus, online and not working, versus not online at all. Just noticing if the person is browsing the web versus on email is not enough information to know this. For example you can be on a word document creating your wedding invitations or for work. The app will have no clue. It needs to be an accurate record if the person is working or now. Then if you have that accurate record you can do a whole lot more with it as well (know exact times that you start and stop working).<p>The other potential chat innovation for business is having the teams configured ONE time by the company admin and then all team members are instantly in the correct teams and each person doesn't have to configure their teams.<p>Also better search of previous team discussions.<p>I'm guessing the business model will evolve :)",1344945492

Building open source software doesn't mean giving your work away for free, nothing keeps the author from selling his open source application on App Store as a convenience (an example of this practice is Growl).

How are we expected to raise a generation of functioning, independent adults if the default expectation is that kids are constantly chaperoned? The societal dangers are familiar to anyone who's tried to deal with the average intern.<p>Unaccompanied minors on US airlines are very common. The service works well, most of the time, but when it fails the result is always a lost, scared child and some very angry parents. Headlines inevitably follow. In this case, United's callous treatment is utterly deplorable. Please understand that it's the airline that's at fault here, not the parents for availing themselves of a tried and tested service.<p>Children are humans, therefore highly adaptable and a lot smarter than anyone thinks. Lone children as young as six are frequently put in charge of an entire family's herd of goats in Kenya; now, granted, there aren't the same dangers from traffic or population density that you'd find in a city, but the herd represents the majority of the family's wealth and it's therefore an awesome responsibility. Imagine herding your parent's entire net worth at that age! Kids that young take the bus - the regular commuter service - to school alone in the UK all the time.

IANAL, but there are still two manners in which there could be a violation:<p>- The BSD license requires one to preserve the copyright notices and the BSD license. If that person stripped these from the software, he would be in violation of the BSD license.<p>- If the seller did not add anything that is copyrightable, I guess it's questionable if his added terms hold up. In this case it is exactly the same as the original BSD-licensed product, and covered by the BSD license.<p>What usually happens is that some proprietary software vendor takes a chunk of BSD-licensed software (say, a TCP/IP stack) and integrates it into their proprietary software (say, a kernel). In that case, you'd theoretically be allowed to pry out the BSD-licensed parts and redistribute it. In practice, this will be impossible, since the original source files are probably changed to such an extend that it's a mixture of BSD-licensed and proprietary software.<p>~~~<p>Of course, this is all the effect of choosing a weak copyleft license. You are practically saying 'you can do whatever you want with this code, as long as you list my name and this license in the source code and/or binary versions, and don't sue my if it doesn't work correctly'.

I just want to tackle the ""having it all"" discussion.<p>When people say they want to ""have it all"", they're not actually saying they won't be happy until they have <i>everything</i>. A life without tradeoffs is literally impossible. You can't, for example, become an expert on every subject or visit every location in the world or learn how to play every musical instrument ever made. It's impossible. Rather, they want a life full of the stupid bullshit tradeoffs that you have to deal with if they don't have resources, like having to decide between a 90-minute commute vs. living in a cramped space without a dishwasher.<p>Those horrid tradeoffs make it impossible for most people to achieve anything great. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. If you're losing 20 hours per week to housework, you won't have a good career. If you don't have a good career, you won't be able to afford help. You have to bust your ass during your 20s and 30s (and preferably not have any health problems or setbacks) while you can to establish momentum, and just hope that your reproductive potential hasn't declined too much by the time you're career's in order and society has thereby given you permission to have kids properly.<p>Tradeoffs always exist, but there are people who are richer and more established and have a higher quality of tradeoff to face. If you're debating whether to leave a high-level position for a ""risky"" CEO spot at a funded startup, this is a high-quality tradeoff. If ""downshifting"" your career means you buy a place with a view of Prospect Park instead of Central, that's a high-quality tradeoff. If having another kid means that one spouse is going to have to give up a career, that's a low-quality tradeoff. People with enough resources (not just income, but also connections; well-connected people don't fret about getting fired and don't have to work 60+ hours per week) <i>can</i> have two successful careers and well-adjusted children.<p>The ""have it all"" rhetoric is an attempt people make to universalize the problem, because no one can actually have everything, and divert attention away from the more specific/parochial fact that they're miserable because they don't have enough resources (since no one likes a person who whines about not being rich). And if you want to actually achieve something in this world, most people don't have enough.

4380293,comment,4376306,4376306,2,0,ajuc,,,"I remember to this day the lesson in primary school, when we first started solving word problems. It was sth like 3rd class. Teacher would ask simple question, like ""how many apples we had to add to each chest, if there is 4 chests with 7 apples in each, and we need to have total of 32 apples"". And kids had to ""brainstorm"" and translate that into mathemathic process and solve (not algebra, just ""first we need to know how many apples we lack, so we substract, then we need to know how many apples per chest we lack, so we divide"", we didn't knew algebra yet). If the question wasn't specific, the kid that pointed it out got praise for being observant, and teacher specified what he meant. Most kids liked that lesson, and there was fierce competition to be the first to guess. That was the moment I felt in love with math, before that I thought I'm more of a humanist (which meant it's OK I can't understand decimal fractions ;) ).<p>I think teaching kids to translate problem into math is very important, not only for math, but also if they want to be economists, computer programmers, etc. I cringe when I read that kids ""know math, but don't know which equation to use to solve the problem"". My wife taught math in secondary school for a while (in Poland, not USA, but we've recently had reform modeling our schools on those in ""the West""). Many kids she taught had no idea how to translate word problem into math problem. They just pattern-matched keywords to equations. It's very sad, and I understand why they hate math - it must be completely frustrating to play this ""guess the equation"" game.<p>So - I think there should be more focus on teaching kids to understand the basic word problems, before they even know algebra. To be sure, that they understand when we need to substract x, and when we need to substract from x.",1344942437

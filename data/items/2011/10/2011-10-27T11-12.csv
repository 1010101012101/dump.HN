The first customer you ensnare is given access to the source code, as well as the right to redistribute your work under the same conditions that you do, blowing up your entire business model.<p>I hope I'm not being too pedantic, but let me quote your original post and explain why I don't feel the above detracts from my point:<p><i>I would say that your position is diammetrically opposed to Stallman's stated goal.</i><p>The goals of the FSF (and thus Stallman, if only by his function as president) have nothing to do with money. The fact that there are ways of making money in the sofware world that <i>are</i> compatible with the GPL license is evidence of this. I mentioned some in my other post. This may not be as profitable as straight up selling (or renting out) the right to use your software, but that is merely a side-effect, not the ultimate <i>goal</i>.",1319716798

To expand on that notion, I'm specifically looking for a language with manual memory management like plain C, functions as a first class citizen and eventually closures (although I'm not sure how that would fit with the manual memory management).<p>The reason why I really like C is that it's possible to finely tune data structures and optimize both for spatial and temporal complexity. However, the inability to use more abstract constructs such as lambdas and closures are in some cases a real PITA.<p>If this hasn't been done, any ideas why ? Is it technically feasible ?",1319716762
3162596,comment,3157822,3157822,1,0,fumbe,,,"Great post! I'm an MSc Tech Entrepreneurship student with a software background and would either join an existing startup or launch my own. I'm actually attending the silicon milkroundabout event this Sunday.<p>I can relate to the problem in the following ways:<p>(1) Culture - The UK and Europe in general does not have the same 'entrepreneurship spirit' like they do in the\nUS. The vast majority are looking for stability, rather than risk and rewards (both personal and financial). A\nrecent article published in the telegraph stated that my university (UCL), has the highest number of graduates going into self-employment, and the figure was still just 2.4%, so you can imagine the rest. <a href=""http://tgr.ph/tTMHaJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tgr.ph/tTMHaJ</a><p>(2) Value - There not so many people from a software background in my course (around 10%), so I tried to reach out to undergraduate Computer Science students in the same department in order to organise something similar to the silicon milkroundabout, but just for students on campus, i.e. match up budding tech entrepreneurs with developers and aspiring hackers. We received less than 3% interest, which kind of reflects the newspaper figure. I don't think they see the value of joining a start-up at the early stage. <a href=""http://econ.st/uOw02e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econ.st/uOw02e</a><p>(3) Presence - In the last few months, even though the term has just started I’ve received a lot of emails about recruitment fairs on campus with banks, financial institutions, large corporate IT companies etc. These are normally oversubscribed and I'm sure a lot of these graduates will end up in those companies, as they are recruited whilst still in their final year. Perhaps finance might be a factor as well. A lot of people can’t afford to work for ‘shares and equity’ after graduating with thousands of pounds in student debts, they would rather clear or reduce those as quickly as possible.<p>So, I would say, if you want to get more students taking part rather than established developers, you would need to come to campus and organise events there. Maybe do a tour around UK universities. Someone I met at a recent techmeetups event is actually founding a startup that teaches kids in school how to write python code. If they start early they are more likely to do it out of interest, rather than to get a secure job with a bank.",1319716758

I've been using Postmark for about two years now, and I love it. I'm even beta testing one of their upcoming features for inbound email handling. One of the reasons I prefer Postmark to other services like SendGrid is their awesome simple and inexpensive pricing. Even though they don't have fancy features like unsubscribe links and all that, those features aren't that hard to implement yourself. I'm seeing that SES is more comparable to Postmark than to MailChimp(which really ain't for transactional emails) and SendGrid(with all the fancy features). SES is cheaper than Postmark with just $0.10/1000 emails instead of $1.50/1000 emails.",1319715937

Everything responded quickly and easily to touch, the hardware was nice and the OS very slick.  There were a number of innovative features I haven't seen in other smartphone OS's.  For example, swiping from outside the screen is picked up by the OS to perform actions, such as task switching, while swipes the originate inside the screen are sent through to the running application.  Thanks to this the N9 manages to get away with no OS level 'home' or 'back' buttons, either physical or on screen.<p>I came away from using the N9 feeling more than a little sad.  As a consumer competition and innovation are good.  As a programmer its great to see new ideas blooming and another platform that will further drive innovation.<p>We are all a little poorer for MeeGo being cancelled.  For some reason the words of John Donne seem strangely appropriate: ""any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

The specs I linked are Level 3 specs, but independent of selectors and of one another (columns are a CR, grid is a working draft).<p>To sum up, your question does not really make sense. Grids and columns are part of ""CSS4"" insofar as they are part of ""CSS3"" through being Level 3 specifications, but that's completely meaningless. Level 4 selectors could become recommandations before (level 3) grids reach that state, or not. There's no dependency. (columns are already supported by all modern browsers except MSIE).<p>I'd recommend using (and abusing) <a href=""http://caniuse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/</a> to see the implementation state of each spec, it's become especially important with modular level 3 specs as implementors are free to add one level 3 spec and ignore an other.<p>[0] You can see a list of specs at <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/#tr_CSS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/#tr_CSS</a>, note how some Level 3 specs are Recommendations, others are Candidate Recommandations, yet others are Last Calls or Drafts.",1319715548

I, as a developer, do not have the right to develop a module of software that uses a GPLed module of software, and then sell it as closed source (to stop someone else from packaging up my work and distributing it for free).</i><p>Yes, if you've released your software under the GPL, collecting money by granting access to it in exchange for money is not a feasible business model. There are other ways, though. Think along the lines of providing support. You could also sign a contract in advance, exchanging a GPL application for a mountain of cold hard cash.<p><i>What threats?

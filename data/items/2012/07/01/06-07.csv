4184059,comment,4184005,4184005,12,0,brianwillis,,,"I'm really of two minds about the write for you/write for an audience argument. I started blogging early this year, and so far I've written and published four posts that don't make me want to gouge my eyes out. That's not to say that what I've written is especially good, just that it's passable. When I started I was shooting for one post a month, so I'm obviously way behind on what I thought was a conservative goal.<p>What surprises me most about the whole exercise is how overwhelmingly <i>bad</i> I am at writing. More than 80% of the content I've written has been thrown away. If I wrote code like this I'd have been out of work long ago, but I just can't bring myself to go on permanent record with half-baked poorly thought out blog posts.<p>I hate to put this so bluntly, but many people out there lack this kind of restraint. As a consequence, there's just a universe of truly awful writing online. The Joel Spolskys and Steve Yegges are really few and far between.<p>So yeah, write for you, but if you don't mind, could you do the world a service and write for the rest of us too? We'll all be better for it.",1341125885

You need an RSS reader to use RSS, a techguy can just move on download rssowl, rssbandit...etc or use google reader, the average Joe has never heard of RSS bandit, has no clue how no clue how to use RSS on a computer and needing to download a new software or signup to another service to take advantage of RSS is another entry barrier for many people, so that's actually the main problem IMHO. Of course you have many publications with a crap user experience on their RSS full of Ads and truncated feeds ( I run a service <a href=""http://www.feedsapi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feedsapi.com</a> that fix both issues) , butnthere are many services to fix that.<p>In contrast, the entry barrier for rss on smartphone is very low, users download an RSS reader and they are ready to go. I mean, flipboard, Sparse RSS Pro,  Pulse, Reeder...etc, are nothing else than RSS readers and they are very popular on all platforms ( android, iOs, windowsphone....) and the average joe tend to love them as well, so I think RSS just need more time to fully reach the average Joe. Social Media is no replacement for RSS, I don't get why people tend to compare both, it feels like comparing oranges to apples.<p>P.S. sorry for my english, not a native speaker.",1341125875

4184037,comment,4183209,4183673,1,0,nkurz,,,"I may be using incorrect terminology, or at least I think you are presuming a more object oriented interpretation.  I don't recall the exact circumstance, but it was a case where one would normally call calloc() rather than malloc() once for a buffer. This proposal to switch to calloc() was rejected due to expense of calling bzero(). I think I proposed making it a array with an initializer rather than a pointer, taking a couple KB size penalty in return for quieting a warning and removing some code smell.<p>The code wasn't merely copying an uninitialized variable, it was branching on the random data that happened to be in the data returned by malloc().  This confused Valgrind, but was thought to be safe due to some later check.  To me this was fragile code and unsafe practice.  To the decision makers, it was a good way to save a couple cycles and a few bytes.  The culture (at least at the time) felt that efficiency trumped clarity and maintainability.

You only get to think of Alan as inefficient because you know what Charles did in a similar situation. However, if you only knew what Alan did you'd say he was smart and efficient.<p>He did everything he was expected to do and some more, a very industrious guy. He didn't seem bothered about doing a complicated design, writing lots of code, coordinating the other developers and the testers, revising the code several times and maintaining it. He wasn't lazy at all.<p>On the other hand, probably Charles didn't want to do all that stuff. He just wanted to write as little code as possible with as few bugs as possible and be done with it, no maintenance at all. And that required  thinking very carefully and deeply about the problem he had to solve in order to get it right and write the necessary code.<p>In trying to do as little work as possible and return to Space Invaders, he had to be smart and efficient.

4184001,comment,4181382,4183469,6,0,scarmig,,,"Lines up well with my impressions of the system.<p>Perhaps my point about not doing stupid treatments was badly phrased, though: your collarbone example is one such treatment, and stupid isn't exactly the right word. Humans seem to have this inborn tendency to always overestimate the effects of medical care. The USA healthcare system thrives on that impulse: if there's any procedure at all that could conceivably do something and you can afford health insurance, you get it, from a full array of pointless tests to highly invasive surgery.<p>In the UK, the system seems to work on the opposite assumption: because every cent spent on healthcare is a cent that the government doesn't have access to, it vigorously refuses treatments if at all possible. Hence, your collarbone example: most collarbones (apparently) heal easily enough on their own, so it's cheaper to assume it will and treat it later than it is to treat all of them to the maximum extent possible. ""Death panel"" is fairly histrionic, but it does have some validity to it. The issue is that if we want to get the American system's spiraling costs out of control, we need to recognize it doesn't have enough death panels (i.e. a willingness to say, no, it's better to give half-assed or no treatment here and perhaps sacrifice some level of well-being in order to save a couple bucks).<p>I personally believe that people place way too much faith in the ability of medical science to perfect outcomes, and that much of what we do amounts to modern voodoo. So I tend toward thinking that doing the minimum treatment that can be justified is the better way to go.",1341123518

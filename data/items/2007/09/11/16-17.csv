An industry leader would do well to announce a relatively irrelevant feature like longest duration if it impressed decision makers in the government enough to give the business more money. <p>The really important tech beyond lighter than air ships that I mentioned in another comment is in-air refueling of UAVs. With that, any autonomous ship can be in the air until maintenance is needed. That is more important than the longest run of an efficiency craft.<p>I am still impressed that the bombing runs on Afghanistan 6 years ago took off from America. ",1189529695

I will be living in a cardboard box and eating ramen in the Valley, but the necessary financial arrangements have been made to ensure that my son will continue his current (private) school, the bills will be paid at home, and life will continue more or less as normal for the 3+ months I am away.<p>It comes down to how badly you want the experience.  Look at it this way:  Grad school at Stanford is ~40k/year, not including living expenses.  Making whatever sacrifices necessary to experience ycombinator should be significantly less, but the experience and contacts most likely will dwarf what you are most likely to gain from a top tier graduate program in Engineering.  Is it worth the investment?  I can't speak for anyone but myself when I say ""Absolutely.""",1189526845

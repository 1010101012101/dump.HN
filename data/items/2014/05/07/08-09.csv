It is based on simulation, non-production JVM, doesn&#x27;t use state of the art GC algorithms and rerunning the same benchmarks with Oracle JVM gives completely different results.<p>Also stating that GC CPU/memory overhead is X is generally incorrect because it depends on far too many things, like garbage production rate, eden space size, survivor rates, GC parallelism level etc.<p>I do have at least two coputational heavy applications running on JVM (one is doing lot of sparse LU-decompositions, another one is evolutionary optimization; both doing <i>some</i> allocations in the tight loop) and none of them requires 2x memory to run at top speed; they require much, much less. Everything depends on how it is coded. If you keep garbage production rates sane, and most objects die with first minor GC, the overhead of GC is extremely small, both CPU and memory-wise. I don&#x27;t know what they did to get 6x overhead - this looks extremely fishy. Even memory heavy apps like databases don&#x27;t reserve 6x more heap than the live set size.<p>Of course, there are some use cases, when GC definitely sucks (pauses, huge heaps) and therefore Rust is a nice thing to have. I hope some of those techniques get adapted in the future by GCed languages in order to reduce memory pressure.",1399451793

7709177,comment,7708412,7709059,8,0,simonh,,,"The Chinese government believes that China needs a growth rate close to 10% in order to absorb expansion in the available labour force. Already Chinese universities are churning out far more graduates than there are new graduate level jobs. There&#x27;s also a steady stream of labor from the countryside seeking work in the cities and factories. The economy has barely been keeping up with demand for jobs as it is.<p>The other problem is that local governments in China are massively overextended with vast outstanding debts, mostly backed by property. Chinese local officials are routinely rotated between regions, so they have little long term commitment to the area they run and are only interested in results during their tenure. This has lead to a generation of highly short-term management decisions, ramping up debt to fund prestige projects, with chronic lack of long term planning or infrastructure investment. Much of Chinese domestic driven growth is spending wasted on white elephant construction projects. When those turn out to be worthless, the entire Chinese domestic economy will crash.<p>A third issue is that up to half of the populations of Chinese cities are technically migrant labour and, even if they&#x27;ve lived in the city for generations, they are technically not residents and have no claim on local services or any welfare support and no pensions. When the bubble bursts they&#x27;ll be left with nothing. Either the flow of labour from the countryside to the cities will reverse, or the system will break.",1399451716

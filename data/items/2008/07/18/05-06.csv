249487,story,,,8,2,alnayyir,"Linux Font Rendering: Ubuntu vs. Debian vs. OS X vs. Windows",,"I don't have a blog, so I'm afraid my review/question will go here.<p>My question, from the outset as I sit at this debian box, is why is the font rendering so good? This may seem like a strange question until you consider that I've tried most major Linux distributions, and some arcane ones, Mac OS X, and Windows. (I've used Linux and Windows extensively, OS X is still a tinkering platform for me.)<p>I'm something of a stickler about my ""environment"". I'm kind of finicky about it, for a programmer (by hobby for the time being, trying to decide if I should go the certification route or go for a degree, which'll be my next post on here).<p>Anyway, the font rendering on Ubuntu in my experience has been mostly bad. It wasn't outright horrible, because I've definitely used some Linux distros (especially in the old days, CHRIST) that had font rendering that made my eyes bleed. Those were the days I stayed in my damn terminal.<p>Mac OS X's font rendering is intriguing, in that they are super-aggressive across the whole platform in anti-aliasing. While I appreciate the effect they are trying to accomplish, I think cranking the AA to 11 was a little much, and sacrifices too much font rendering accuracy. Not to mention it annoyed the hell out of anyone who used Safari on Windows. (I don't think porting OS X font rendering to safari for windows was the best choice, as much as I may prefer it to IE. It has gotten bad reviews amongst my fellow typographically finicky users.)<p>Windows font rendering is what it is. On a decent resolution LCD or CRT, the zero-AA fonts are tolerable and functional, enough so that Windows is my 2/3's of the time OS. With AA turned on, I find XP's font rendering to be a bit thick and on the side of ugly. Kind of like that girl who seems a bit too fat for your taste, but seems to have potential for looking much better with a little TLC.<p>Then there's Debian. I just installed etch and the default user environment (netinst) on my Powermac G4 (I got it for 30 bucks. Whaddya want?) and the default font rendering is...IMHO, gorgeous. The AA is light but soft (not like a drag queen like Mac OS X), and it's the first time I've ever believed the font rendering in Open Office to not be utterly horrible. (Admittedly a different default font was used in OO.o as compared to Win32/Ubuntu, but I've used the font before and it didn't look this good.) (The debian install was vanilla gnome. Not that you'll hear me complain about vanilla gnome.)<p>Am I seriously facing a situation where the Debian guys have put together an auto-configged X.org that has the best font rendering I've ever seen as compared to the supposedly userspace obsessed Ubuntu/OS X?<p>Anyway, I'd like comments from any BSD users if they're out there. Does a BSD Ports install of X (or from the CD) autoconfig X? If so, what is the font rendering like?<p>Any Mac users have any positive/negative feelings regarding the heavy AA on OS X? I find it attractive, it's just...to heavy for me, and I can't really seem to change the AA in any meaningful manner that affects the output significantly.<p>Thanks for reading, if you got this far. You'll likely hear me shoot my mouth off about my (mis)adventures in Unix/Linux userspace further on as well.",1216360650

249465,comment,249393,249393,0,0,ljlolel,,,"I was very excited to buy a Mac Mini the other day.  I was very disappointed to learn over several weeks that, despite what Paul Graham and DHH and others say,  OS X sucks for hacking.<p>I experiment with a number of languages, I pull in many different libraries, I use various different tools and scripts and programs from the command line.  Frankly, installing any one of these things onto a Mac is a pain.<p>In Ubuntu, I simply do apt-get install.  On a Mac, I have to download a tarball and compile it (their package management systems have many fewer packages, many of which are out of date).  If I wanted to compile things, I would use Gentoo.  Actually, Gentoo is much better since I think the portage package management system is very well-developed, up-to-date, large, fast, handles dependencies brilliantly, and has the option for some binaries.<p>As for the general use of the Mac: if you want to do anything that is not the default, good luck.  Learning all of the different ways you can do something non-standard on a Mac is like learning black magic. You have to Google around to find out the secret incantations.  For example, to ask for the boot menu, you must psychically know to hold down ALT as it boots.  The other day, I wanted to test out how well my site worked with Flash off, only to discover I couldn't.  I found a site with some complicated instructions about how to go about disabling Flash on OS X.  I just gave up and rebooted into Ubuntu.<p>Basically, hacking on OS X is <i>exactly</i> like working with linux 5 years ago, when I had to be an expert on esoteric systems to do what I want.<p>Just do what I do: dual-boot into Ubuntu.  I boot into OS X when I want to use iTunes, watch TV/movies using the cool Mac remote, or develop iPhone apps.",1216357895

I found out that it is hard to get people to submit sports stories. So I redid it as a Drudge Report for sports news.<p>Behind the scenes, the site checks ~100 sports feeds, and using classifier.arc and some other things, puts it into a league and judges the story for interestingness. Interesting and timely sports stories are put on the page, sorted by league (or by topic if the topic overwhelms the league, e.g. the Brett Favre unretirement or A-Rod divorce stories).",1216342163

It's just data and we need to model what we actually care about, and then monitor for that.<p>E.g. I don't really care that there's a war in Darfur, I care that the world has more armed conflicts now than last year. So write a script to keep track of them (scrape wikipedia) and when the number goes up, email yourself to write a check to UNHCR.",1216340665

249281,comment,248322,248460,0,0,orib,,,"That's the point. It's far easier to simply tack on more code to special case something than it is to come up with a simple solution that will gracefully handle all input.<p>To take your example of the Windows scheduler, I would expect that the reason that they made it special-case the foreground app instead of coming up with a more generic, algorithm with better interactive performance was because it would have required more hard thinking. (Of course, I can't say this for sure without seeing their code)<p>This is also the same reason that a beginner's code will be so convoluted. They try to handle everything through adding more complexity in special cases, instead of stopping and thinking about how to orthogonalize the code, making a simpler algorithm.<p>The same argument applies to UIs -- its far easier to add an option than to make a tool more generically useful. It would be far easier for google to add textfields to their UI for specifying the sort of searches you want to do more clearly than it would be for them to improve their pagerank algorithms.<p>Things need to be as simple as possible, but no simpler, and simplicity is usually far harder to achieve than complexity for a given problem.",1216339754

Judging by the fact that you didn't defect from Reddit sooner, it can be reasoned that you enjoy a dash of offbeat humor, politics, and funny pictures with your programming (and in this case entrepreneurial) articles and news.  In other words, you're like me, and the rest of the early majority.<p>We go from social news site to social news site, dragging down article quality with our penchant for less-than-total fact saturation and off-topic posts.<p>The only responsible thing is to get your hacker news here, and your funny pictures elsewhere.

Additionally, a comment count would be welcomed.<p>Including a rating, or including a dynamic feed for a particular rating would be icing on the cake.<p>fwiw, i'm a happy google reader user -- 158 subscriptions. The only downside is that it's my go-to procrastination website. I read just about all RSS content, and click through about 10-20% of the time depending on the feed. If I find that I clear the unread on a feed more than once or twice, I'll usually unsubscribe (because obviously I don't have the time to keep up with it).

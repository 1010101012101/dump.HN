For those I would point out other known failings. Come now, that's nearly a bait and switch.<p>In your second response you say:<p>"" Maybe your perspective is one of having a fixed residence for all of your life. Unfortunately, my life didn't progress that way and every time I move to a new place I have to go through the same rigmarole all over again.""<p>So perhaps if you aren't referring to bank accounts you may mean education which you refer to. Thats possible with a transfer certificate and transcripts, and at most, a birth certificate. Having personally navigated one of the worst possible categories of transfers into the Indian education system, I can say that Identity, was never an issue. Sloth, confounding rules, paperwork were greater transgressors.<p>Now regards your other points. Having several family members in defense, and the government ID is not an issue for them. As far as I know the Def. forces have their own ways of ensuring proof of residence. I can try and check up to confirm if need be.<p>Regarding the list of ID systems you provided.<p>PAN: Non tax payers dont have them. But Tax payers do. And given the recent conversions in Tax policy, thats a larger portion of the population. But that still ignroes -<p>Ration Card: This is extremely common. From discussions with hired help on their situation, they are nearly religious in the way they value the card and make sure they have one. And for a more universal measure of its prevalence, do note  that its one of the first and most common things given to people to regularize slums and shanties. So for the worse off sections of society its extremely prevalent.<p>And if THAT doesn't work: There are Voter ID cards which fill the void for people who don't travel.<p>-----------------------<p>These are issues which are not tech issues, but in reality are people problems. We can never remove the need for discipline, civic sense, and standards in service delivery.<p>Other countries have managed without retina scanners, or finger print IDs of all their citizens. Saying that we are a special case where we need tech to solve our problems is a red herring. Its also a rejection of responsibility and the burden we must carry. There is no quick fix for this.<p>There is also a major reason why all those countries which did conceive of using a UID system like ours, balked and fled.<p>If having the finger prints of every citizen doesn't bother you, then we really can't see eye to eye.<p>-----------------------<p>It seems you are mostly troubled by the paper work, in particular, for proof of residence.<p>That's not something the UID system will ever solve. The Govt has no intention of ever rolling back those clauses. The political calculus and players are harshly inimical at worst to the idea, and couldn't care less if they tried, at best.<p>UID or not, you will always need to provide proof that you live there.<p>The only thing the UID will do is become an umbrella number which will help track where you stay, which Cafe's you use and when, what your taxes are and more. All in the name of helping people suffering from middle men and not being able to get their ration.<p>There is already constant feature creep - the ideal behind this was a way to help the poorer of us get access to resources and help, without the middle man. It is written in its founding document that no services will be denied due to lack of a UID.<p>Recently the MP govt. stated that a UID card is compulsory to avail of piped gas. You have good reason to trust your govt. I assume.<p>The convenience perhaps.",1345391750

And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

4404279,comment,4403662,4403662,1,0,FrojoS,,,"Great talk. I don't know much about artificial neural networks (ANN) and even less about natural ones, but I have the feeling that I learnt a lot from this video.<p>If I understand correct, Hinton's ANN's randomly shuts of a substantial part (~50%) of the neurons during each learning iteration. He calls this ""dropout"". Therefore, a single ANN represents many different models. Most models never get trained, but they exist in the ANN, because they share their weights with the trained models. This learning method avoids over specializing and therefore improves robustness with respect to new data but it also allows for arbitrary combination of different models which tremendously enlarges the pool of testable models.<p>When using or testing these ANNs you also ""dropout"" neurons during every prediction. Practically, every rerun predicts a different result by using a different model. Afterwards, these results are averaged. The more results, the higher the chance, that the classification is correct.<p>Hinton argues, that our brains work in a similar way. This explains among other things\n	a) Why are neurons firing in a random manner? \nIt's an equivalent implementation to his ""dropout"" where only a part of the neurons is used at any given time.\n	b) Why does spending more time on a decision improve the likely hood of success? \nEven though there might be more at work, his theory alone is able to explain the effect. The longer you think, the more models you test, simply by rerunning the prediction. The more such predictions the higher the chance, that the average prediction is correct.<p>To me, the latter also explains in an intuitive way, why the ""wisdom of the crowds"" works well when predicting events that many people have an, halfway sophisticated, understanding of. Examples are betting on sport events or movies box office success. As far as I know, no single expert beats the ""wisdom of the crowd"" in such cases.<p>What I would like to know is, how many, random model based predictions do you need until the improvement rate becomes insignificant? \nIn other words, would humans act much smarter if they could afford more time to think about decisions? Put another way, does the ""wisdom of the crowd"" effect stem from the larger amount of combined neurons and the diversity of the available models that follows, or from the larger amount of predictions that are used to compute the average? How much less effective would the crowd be, if less people make more (""e.g. top 5"") predictions or if the crowd was made up of few individuals which are cloned?<p>If the limiting factor for humans is the time to predict based on many different models and not the amount of neurons we have, this would have interesting implications. Once, a single computer would have sufficient complexity to compete with the human brain, you could merely build more of these computers and average there opinions to arrive at better conclusions that any human could (<i>). Computers wouldn't be just faster than humans, they would be much smarter, too.<p>(</i>) I'm talking about brain like ANN implementations here. Obviously, we already use specialized software to predict complex events like weather, better than any single human could. But these are not general purpose machines.",1345390738

Also, as Kerrick mentioned, there are 3rd party device APIs already available such as PhoneGap, Adobe Cordova, Rhomobile, Appcelerator, and more.  As for performance, I agree with you to a degree.  Older phones, or tablets, have problems with CSS3 animations due to the OS' lack of, also as Kerrick mentioned, hardware acceleration support in older mobile browsers, but newer phones and tablets have no problem.

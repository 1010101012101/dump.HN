I doubt many would care, same as not many care for 1900 music, 1900 books, 1900 photographs and such. Some scholars maybe.<p>Second, what the parent said goes beyond that. Essentially he says, the people of 2200 could have the streets of 2100 fully 3D imaged, but empty of life, with people of 2100 mostly staying at home and merely doing VR walks.<p>Now this might sound far-fetched and implausible, but not much more than telling 1900  people that in 100 years there would be cities were people rarely walk in public to go about their business but mostly go around with their cars.",1376479037

6210823,comment,6201495,6209842,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"How the QE works is that these trillions and trillions are pumped from the FED directly to big zombie banks to help them stay afloat. As big banks spend these money by investing in bonds, equities, VCs, whatever, the economy as a whole starts feeling better, I agree. And the prices rise too. The problem is that the last ones to receive it still have to pay harsh inflation tax even though they didn&#x27;t get much out of the benefit. It works like this (money creation):
FED --> banks --> whoever banks loan money to or invest in (investment banks) --> VCs, real estate, homeowners (from your example), etc. --> whoever these folks spend money to. The poor gets poorer in that scenario, while rich get richer (and I&#x27;m a republican here, mind you)<p>So, to answer what you said -- newly created money benefits those who are first to receive it. If the owner of the printing press (the Government) makes it such that group A receives the money first and then decides how to spend it, then the group A will benefit at the expense of everybody else. If group A decides to spend it on people in group B then these folks will mainly benefit as well. And then group B spends on others, so on. The last one to receive it is the big looser. If the Government policy is to hand over the newly printed money to the healthcare companies - healthcare wins at the expense of everybody else. If the Government decides to spend it on the Travel industry - these folks win while we all get hit with the inflation. Etc, etc. It&#x27;s not really rich vs poor debate, it is who gets the freshly printed money from the FED first is the one who benefits at the expense of everybody else.<p>That&#x27;s why inflation is bad. Inflation is the reason why you see the gap between rich and poor - worlwide, not only in the US - getting bigger. Because somehow the FED <i>always</i> hands over newly created money to the banks. And I&#x27;m not a socialist saying it&#x27;s bad on moral grounds - far from it. I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s a sick economy. The FED should be abolished and money should go there where the markets want the money to go. Without being influenced by politicians and their agenda. That&#x27;s what - to me - true republicans hail - free economy. The FED needs to be abolished. And as can be easily shown this money creation process will create bubbles. If newly created money goes to IT, IT has a bubble. That&#x27;s what happened when the FED printed in 1990s to go over Savings and Loan Crisis -- all the newly created money created IT bubble. To fight off the results of that bubble bursting they printed even more -- that&#x27;s what caused to Housing Bubble. And when this one bursted (they always burst) - they created the US Treasuries bubble. The Ultimate Bubble. The Wholy Grail of Bubbles. Bubble in the reserve currency of the world. Bubble in everything across the spectrum. I&#x27;m not going to sit around in the US and wait for that one to burst as well.<p>Bauer Mayer Rothschild, 1838: &quot;Let me issue and control a Nation&#x27;s money and I care not who makes its laws&quot;",1376478480

In addition, there&#x27;s no tax (corporate or personal) in Dubai, and the UAE in general.<p>It&#x27;s a good option to consider if you want to live in a modern city without taxes (it comes with its own catches though).<p>[1] You generally apply through a free zone authority (e.g. DTMFZA). They require you to rent an office, and pay a license -- which can be expensive. But there are multiple free zone authorities in each emirate, and you it&#x27;s possible to find cheap ways to set up a company & issue visas. The cheapest I&#x27;ve found is with the RAK free zone authority:<p>* The company license + rent = $5000 per year. You don&#x27;t actually rent an office, but rather get access to a nice office for a few hours a week. This is useful if you want to meet clients in a nice setting (outside your home).<p>* A work visa - valid for 3 years, costs $2000. That&#x27;s a recurring $2000 every three years.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a good deal due to the absolute lack of taxes. I haven&#x27;t heard of a lot of startups in the Dubai area though.",1376478147

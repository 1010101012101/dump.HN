Purely as a reading device, it will be fantastic for scientific papers which are usually in hard formatted PDFs. Reflowing them for a small e-ink device sucks and makes them hard to read. Having color is a huge bonus (10 shades of grey in a color coded graph is a royal pain). The iPad + the GoodReader app will let you take hundreds of papers and technical books with you. The fact that it has a pretty good web browser and email app with WiFi is an awesome bonus.",1271199546

For now, the desktop is the place for activity like that.<p>However ... Remember all those Star Trek episodes with people sitting at a desk with _several_ pad like devices spread out in front of them; like a paper covered desk?  Now imagine a similar situation with several tablet devices that have some type of screen bridging/device linking software.  I can easily imagine scenarios where this will be useful. Now imagine combining that _with_ a desktop display.<p>Frankly, I think there is a big future in tablet and multi-screen devices as adjunct input and manipulation platforms.

Because if so, I really disagree.  The touch screen simply doesn't lend itself to quick typing and rapid text editing.<p>Ignoring artists, designers and musicians - since, after all, most people are none of those - and focusing on writing, I think the iPad has a chilling effect.  Writing is perhaps the most important activity the average citizen conducts online, so that matters.  People kept writing that the iPad is a computer for mothers - my mother, like many others from her generation, was taught to type, a skill that served her well as a legal secretary.  She types very well now.<p>Given an iPad, I expect that although some tasks may be easier for her to accomplish, her lengthy email missives to her children, and her letters to the editor, are going to be much briefer.  That's a loss to her family and a loss to civic society.<p>Of course, none of that matters if you look at the iPad as a toy, a sketchpad, or a device mainly intended to consume media than produce it.  But if you believe that it is the ""future of computing"", as many call it, then this is a problem.<p>The iPad may well be - and probably is - the future of content consumption, web browsing, gaming, and perhaps television viewing.

However if you copied anyones twitter log, then yes that would be a gross violation of copyright.<p>The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts, which is frequently how copyright law views the use of small pieces. I can legally use someone else's artwork in a collage or in my own non-derivative work (although derivatives basically don't exist in artwork, but for the sake of argument they do as they are still legally recognized) and I am at no legal risk because my collage of 1,000 pieces of artwork creates a whole new piece of art in itself.<p>The book in question is likely a lazy assed crowdsource, likely much of which was written by average Joe's. However the real question here regardless of country is did the author make something new in their book? I remember reading a correspondence book that mixed multiple anonymous letters together to create a chapter, but no two were destined for the same person and it completely cleared any question of copyright infringement, however I doubt this book of tweets was artfully crafted together to evade copyright on the merits of its own work. From what I read of it, its simply hoping to avoid copyright on the duration of material, which it is likely going to do but legally speaking it shouldn't if it really is a lazy crowdsource compilation.",1271196498

It's entirely possible that he would have run the company into the ground while avoiding the other poor choices that Apple made in his absence. It's also entirely possible that during his time away from the company he learned things that allowed him to come back to the company with a fresh outlook. The idea the Steve Jobs is the sole reason that Apple can be successful, leading to the conclusion that Apple would have been successful for their entire history, had Steve Jobs never left, is wild speculation at best.",1271196377

It didn't help that I was searching via the Dell Outlet, where you can't sort by screen resolution (something they're supposed to be fixing in the next couple of months, I've been told) I ended up settling for a 14"" w/ 900px vertical resolution, but I definitely miss the 160 pixels I lost.",1271196364

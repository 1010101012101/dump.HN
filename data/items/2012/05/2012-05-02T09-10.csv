Every IO operation is guarded with a semaphore and access is monitored and exposed. Every cache in the system logs everything from hit and miss rate to volume etc. Every async operation logs operation trails. We also ship a ton of tools for everything from bread and butter stuff like stack dumping, pinpointing long running threads etc. to more sophisticated stuff like being able to break in to a page rendering and profiling various element hierarchies, either over time or following specific users.<p>As I said, we've invested so much in getting the entire stack monitored very granularly, but every time our customers run in to issues it pays dividends.<p>For reference, we run on the JVM which is very pleasant. A ton of tools interop with it and basic things like MBeans being integrated in to JVM makes monitoring a lot easier.",1335952291

I've found it to be a huge negative signal.  These sorts of interviews seem to mostly be about developers patting themselves on the back about how they stumped the applicants in interviews.<p>I think we need to have the talk about the ""hire the smartest developers"" meme in our industry like the web hosting industry talks about five 9s of uptime.  The first nine is writing FizzBuzz.  The second nine is being able to design and maintain large systems.  The third nine is knowing the finer points of Prim's and Dijkstra's and a copy of TAOCP with arbitrary dust coating on the shelf.<p>Do you really need talent that meets a higher standard than that?  Maybe if you are Google or NASA.  But if you are not launching things into space, you don't need to hire the world's smartest people.  Certainly, there is a spectrum between 'we write CRUD software' vs 'we read journals and do some novel algorithms work', and a company in the second category will want to say something positive about the intelligence of their employees as a signal.  But ""we hire the smartest people"" is absolutely the wrong thing to say.<p>""Smarter"" is not even better once you've hit the threshold of ""acceptable number of nines to write this program.""  I routinely pass over hiring extremely smart people.  Some of them have abrasive personalities, or are the wrong cultural fit, or are not interested in the problem domain, etc.",1335951985

He pushes through a distance of around one meter, so using W = F x we can estimate his force as ~300 kN. Normal male feet have a surface area of 500 to 800 cm [1], so if we use 1000 cm for convenience, we get 3 MPa. The compressive strength of concrete is ~10 MPa, so we shouldn't expect the jump to crack concrete, but it might, if his peak force is higher and is exerted through the balls of his feet.<p>[1] (In my case, this is stolen from <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2008.08.004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2008.08.004</a> -- the blogger above tries to estimate his own feet but I have access through such paywalls.

If I'm right then the demo video is cheating a bit by only showing the GPS input initially and the rest of the info seems to come from thin air, which might be why people think it's working with the underlying street data. Dead reckoning with a compass and accelerometer and/or wheel odometer/tachograph might also have produced a similarly wonky line, but then you have two different wonky lines to average together to get a better approximation of the true path.<p>Note this supposition is based almost entirely on doing the first 3 weeks of the Udacity course CS373: Programming a Robotic Car, but it seems to fit quite neatly with the stuff they talk about i.e. a car/robot moving, guessing how far it's moved, taking sensor snapshots of its environment then cleverly combining the data to figure out accurately where it is.<p>Off-topic: scrubbing back and forth in the blog video (to get a better idea of what was happening) seemed incredibly smooth for me, is this a side effect of Youtube/Firefox using HTML5 video?

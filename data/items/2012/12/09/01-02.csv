There's nothing wrong with this. I mean, obesity is another thing in itself - nobody is naturally obese unless they suffer from some sort of medical condition, but the point is if we eat healthy - a decent amount of nutrients without going hog-wild, avoiding shitty processed foods, and also doing a good amount of physical activity, it will make our bodies happy and we can be healthy. I do hate the social pressure to conform to some sort of mythical perfect body, but at the same time I think looking after your body - not starving or totally over-indulging it is important.",1355018239

This was even more true for early Ruby libraries - I can testify to it as of 2001-2003 when I was maintaining several English language libraries and writing a chapter for one of those unfortunate Syngress compilations (I was young and bad at saying no).  If you're conflating Ruby and Rails, yes Rails is pretty much English-only - but though it's a common mistake, it's dead wrong if you're discussing actual languages.  Even now I occasionally run into libraries with significantly longer Japanese documentation by character count and given relative density that probably means quite a lot longer in terms of actual content.",1355018042

I didn't do that because the previous commenter's statement placed no restrictions on the types of question I could ask. But it doesn't make a difference.<p>The scientific answer, 100 years ago, to this reworded question was ""yes."" Quoting from the Wikipedia article on eugenics: ""Many members of the American Progressive Movement supported eugenics, enticed by its scientific trappings and its promise to cure social ills."" Again I point out that there were academic posts in eugenics, conferences, and funded scientific research, and the result of this work guided government policy decisions, including government mandated sterilizations in Sweden up until 1975.<p>Remember, the topic I'm responding to is ""Name one question for which a scientific answer no matter how inadequate was once the best, but for which now a philosophical or religious one is the best one?"" The premise to the topic allows inadequate science, so I'm justified in using this case even though we had a poor understanding of genetics 100 years ago.<p>Oh!

I do not see the point -- except for entertainment -- of psychoanalysis being carried out just because there were not yet good tools for doing science.

Totally natural though: when confronted with too complex a situation, we seek abstractions so we are not overwhelmed with the enormity of the information.<p>The kind of abstraction that works is greatly influenced by its surrounding context. In more complex issues (say in law), appeal to common sense is sometimes more preferable than using the most fashionable 'scientific theory'. You don't like your spouse? How about teaching her evolutionary biology/psychology?<p>Dogmatism breeds the act of taking these out of context. Some parts of math works in their internal framework(i.e. math), but taking it out of context is at best, dumb, and at worst, harmful. Having theorems giving infinite-length messages yield certain events of probability one makes all 'realistic' outcomes probability zero. Same for theorems too sensitive to perturbation in axioms that removing a single point turns things upside down.<p>We don't need 'institutional science', or dogma, or 'mathematics strictly contained in universities', all we need is science, is mathematics, is reason, and understanding their application context.<p>Such debate often occurs with confusing science with 'opinions of the majority of scientists in academia of what's right'. No, science is not the latter.<p>[TL;DR] Science and math are useful in a very specified context, and as such is a framework of thinking. Those who take some of their context-dependent results universally and urge everyone to accept it is dogmatic, not scientific.",1355016737

Eventually, the browser is going to open a connection to the resource, and then the user can see it in FireBug.  You could hide it with Flash, but you'd have other problems with compatibility on mobile devices.  You might be able to do it with a proxy too, but then the proxy would be visible.

I have been at one of the large software companies for almost a year now (first job after college, good CS school) and I've decided to change jobs before I get too comfortable here.<p>Given the large number of interesting startups, what kind of questions should I be asking, not only the engineers / founders of the startup, but also myself? What are the signs of a healthy startup (funding, background of the founders)? How do I gauge the core principles and culture of a startup?<p>I apologize in advance if some of these questions don't make sense or may even be irrelevant in the pursuit of finding a job at a startup. I also realize different people will have differing opinions about how to evaluate a startup. That would be particularly helpful.<p>Most of the links I came across while searching on google were about investors evaluating startups. I didn't find many opinions on how to evaluate a startup from a job-seeker's perspective.<p>Thanks in advance",1344128389

Well guess what? There is no foolproof system. The same reactions are seen when sites go down. 'Oh, but they should have used a distributed, redundant buzzword compliant system in a multitude of nuclear bunkers and this would never have happened'. Every system has weaknesses.<p>In this case, the guy had ALL his shit wiped. Not a clumsy move at work causing months of extra work, or some dickhead hacker having some fun with your account credentials, no they actually thoroughly deleted a huge chunk of his personal data.<p>See it's like, if a pyromaniac burns down someone's home, maybe there were ways to prevent that, but you don't go blaming the victim then either. Some times the first thing is sympathy. There's times to be heartless and times to be not.<p>Remote-wiping all his personal stuff was so unnecessarily malicious, sympathy comes first. And besides, in this case, not having any non-remote-wipeable backups, the only thing you could <i>possibly</i> maybe blame him for is putting all his stuff in the cloud. Yeah no not smart, maybe, but it simply doesn't weigh up to the fact that someone actually went through the trouble of meticulously <i>deleting</i> all of it. Not stealing, or defacing, but deleting.",1344128384

An entirely new history? Doesn't that kind of

retain history prior to duplication.<p><pre><code>  > The fact that it is a file system feature that

It also means it is non-portable, and you can lose
this history when backing things up (unless you
only use Time Machine for backups presumably).<p><pre><code>  > The other nice thing is that since it is not

</code></pre>
I'll agree with this. Maybe the middle ground is
something similar to OS X's metadata dot-files
(i.e. ._.filename).<p>I think one of the biggest issues I take with it
is that by making it a part of the document editor
itself, you make it seem (to the user) as if it's
a feature of the application/format, and not a
feature of the operating system that has just been
integrated into the application. Without any other
sort of explanation the user will probably assume
that this is all stored in the document, and be in
for a surprize when they copy it somewhere else,
and the history disappears.",1344126657

I run FDE mostly just out of a personal policy that anything that someone can pick up and walk off with is encrypted, but this is a very good point.<p>The DB is a Sqlite3 database containing plaintext tokens and the account names they are used with, so while the attacker would still need your password, they can generate new tokens with that data.<p>Good policy upon losing any device that contains 2FA information is to use one of your backup codes to log into your account, remove the 2FA, and re-add it, thereby invalidating the old token secret. Thus, even if someone has your unprotected DB, they can't generate tokens for your account.",1344126612

4340134,comment,4338822,4339949,3,0,hammersend,,,"The demise of Loki was informative for a variety of reasons none of which should lead you to conclude ""how few Linux users will buy full priced games"".  The first lesson to gather from Loki was that in order to get people to buy your games, you need a solid well-oiled distribution network.  Stocking a few titles in Electronic Boutique is not a recipe for success.  Steam is different as it puts Linux titles on a level playing field.  I don't have to schlep to a store and <i>hope</i> that they will have the title I'm looking for as I can see it right there on Steam.  And I don't have to worry about a store stocking just the big name stuff as Steam will stock it all and all the time.<p>Another issue that Loki contended with was the fact that most of their games ran at a lower framerate than the Windows counterpart.  Most serious gaming fans want to use their hardware to its maximum potential especially the FPS multi-player twitch gamers.  Valve has a lot more leverage in this regard than Loki ever did.  We all know (because they said so) they are working with the major GPU players to get better drivers made.  But also, they don't just port games, they <i>make</i> them.  The Source engine is very popular and they have already tweaked it significantly so not only is it competitive with how it runs on Windows but it actually surpasses it in maximum frames per second.<p>Another thing Loki dealt with was Linux users were a bit more idealistic in the 90's.  We still held out hope that AAA game titles would just ""appear"" on Linux.  Fast forward to the present day and I doubt many actually believe this.  The problem back then was that if you expected Free top tier games to just appear you had less incentive to actually buy.  I think Linux users are a bit more pragmatic now and are much more willing to pay for a proprietary binary as it's pretty clear that that's the only way you're going to play.  So this is a psychological barrier Valve doesn't have to overcome anymore.<p>Basically, I think Valve is approaching this with the same methodical precision that Tesla is approaching the electric car space.  Look at the problems that exist in an objective way and devise solutions one by one until you achieve success.  Valve may still falter but it won't be for ignoring any lessons Loki could have provided.",1344126082
4340133,comment,4339051,4339051,28,0,kaptain,,,"A typical response I see on HN (and on other forums) in response to failings in other countries (e.g. acts of terrorism, corruption, failure of government support, etc) is to find some sarcastic analogy to compare it to in the US. The Chinese government has gotten on the bandwagon with its own publication of the US's human rights violations (<a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-05/25/c_131611391.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-05/25/c_1316113...</a>). I found this humorous.<p>It would be nave to think that the USA (I'm picking on the USA because I am an American citizen) is the perfect country. I haven't lived in other countries long enough to be able to compare, but I /can/ compare the experience between China and the US and it makes me grateful to be a US citizen.<p>The truth is, there is no real comparison between China and the US: I get questions about corruption in the US all the time and I always answer that there /is/ corruption in the US but not in the endemic/pervasive way that we see it in China. The media is more open than in China, the government process is more transparent.<p>My business partner and I are in the middle of doing a training/internship (simple LAMP application development) for students at a local university. This isn't a top tier university: it's a third-tier university in the capital of one of the poorest regions in the country. There's a lot of potential here but when we asked people if they had any aspirations to entrepreneurship, we mostly get a 'no'. The lack of mobility for the common person is evident here.<p>No matter what the US's failures are what it has that the Chinese system (note that I didn't say government, because some of the issues here are cultural) doesn't have is ""opportunity"". There's a lot of unrealistic optimism here amongst college-age students (i.e. ""I can do it if I try."") but there is a dark understanding that this is severely limited by what is available to them after they graduate. It's actually really sad: people here are in love with pieces of paper that 'qualify' you for a job. But with an overabundance of college graduates (in a system where cheating is normal), the value of a college degree is lessened. So you have a huge population of mid-20's that paid large sums of money for degrees that are largely worthless (i.e. the degrees didn't fulfill the better life that they promised).<p>China has aspirations to be the world's best, but it won't be until it can find a way to empower its own people.",1344126052

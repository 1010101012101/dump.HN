You can switch to a specific gemset at the time you switch rubies with 'rvm 1.9.2@gemset_name', or after with 'rvm gemset use gemset_name'<p>Once you've got that going, make a '.rvmrc' file in the root of your project, and put in it the rvm command to switch to your ruby/gemset. ""echo 'rvm 1.9.2@gemset_name' > .rvmrc"" is probably the easiest way to do this. Then, when you switch to your project, you're in the correct ruby and gemset automatically.

Pismo is more a general purpose content extraction library than Readability and better suited for machine processing and summarization (which is what I use it for).<p>Pismo also comes with a command line client built-in, so you can do stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  $ pismo http://preona.net/2010/11/ever-wanted-arc90s-readability-as-an-api/ title sentences\n\n  :title: ""Ever wanted arc90's Readability as an API?""\n  :sentences: Over at Preona we have been wanting something just like that for a while now. So we built it! Some time ago, while developing LazyReadr, we were faced with the fact that RSS feeds simply aren't all that lovely anymore.\n</code></pre>\nNote: ""sentences"" picks the first few sentences by default, but this is ideal for a summary by an automated system or for a news page :-)",1289909161

10772726,comment,10771806,10772312,0,0,kanzure,,,"> I used to think I could recall conversations, but how do I know they actually happened?<p>That seems trivial to verify; just record details about all conversations you have with everyone. I have been doing this since 2009. I have a 5 MB yaml file with details of every conversations (mostly tags), and I might have an above-average memory but yeah I definitely forget things .... (and sometimes I get some of the details wrong even if a conversation happened just minutes ago).<p>Another way to verify (to yourself only) is to writeup your memory of a conversation, PGP sign it, hash it, give the hash to a friend who was originally in the conversation, then have them do a writeup, then reveal the commitment and compare the two accounts of a conversation. The writeup would be better if it was done immediately after the actual conversation, because otherwise social groups have time to mingle and confuse everyone about what actually happened.<p>Another way is to do a public group writeup of a conversation after it happens (or an audio/video recording), then have everyone PGP sign the writeup (to confirm their agreement), then later pick a random conversation where this setup was performed, and write down your memory of the conversation. This doesn&#x27;t work if the conversations where this setup is performed are all unique; probably has to be a few thousand different setups happen before this starts to test memory in any meaningful capacity.",1450724374

As I write this, I&#x27;m in the middle of a patent lawsuit with Square (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/24u13j6tr/california-northern-district-court/think-computer-corporation-v-square-inc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/24u13j6tr/california-northe...</a>). I don&#x27;t apologize for it.<p>I&#x27;m not a troll. I&#x27;m an inventor and I made a real product. I&#x27;m also someone well known for having dealt with intellectual property theft as a victim. I also spent a year at Stanford Law School poking around as a fellow as I developed what is now the most accurate patent assignment database there is--far more accurate than the official one--on PlainSite.<p>I&#x27;ll be deliberately terse with my comments here, but the upshot is that the problem here isn&#x27;t the <i>idea</i> of patents. They are a lottery ticket to a lawsuit as Elon Musk has said, but they&#x27;re also an important insurance policy for serious innovators. (Another such insurance policy is VC, but not every serious innovator has VC backing.) The problem is the legal profession. Patent trolls (and other sorts of IP trolls) are by and large the creations of corrupt lawyers. Inventors are slighted in favor of large corporations because of &quot;upstanding&quot; lawyers. Transparency is impeded everywhere you turn in the patent world courtesy of the patent bar. And unlike the USPTO TTAB, where corporations can represent themselves at virtually no cost, in the USPTO PTAB, the patent bar has seen to it that you must hire a lawyer.<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence.

10772696,comment,10768076,10770683,0,0,gnarbarian,,,"Here&#x27;s a anecdote of how a typical webapp goes to shit with the best intentions from everyone.<p>&quot;building it right from the start&quot; sounds great. I&#x27;ve never worked on a project where people did not honestly try to do it this way. Lets say that for once you have a clear set of unambiguous requirements (a rarity) when starting in.  I like to start with the database first. I&#x27;ll design a nice normalized database and start building the website from there. If the requirements are fleshed out enough you&#x27;ll already have a map of what pages ought to do what.<p>Once you get to the point where you can have a customer try out a few pages you get some &quot;feedback&quot; which is actually a change in the requirements.  You can&#x27;t hit them with a change request for every little thing at first so you comply. Maybe it&#x27;s just a small change turning a one to many into a many to many relation for example, or moving a few fields from one table to another. Soon you have 30 or so similar &quot;small tweaks&quot; even if you hit them with a change request every time, they don&#x27;t all come in at once giving you a good opportunity to re-evaluate the schema/application as a whole, it&#x27;s always viewed as a singular &quot;small&quot; change so re-factoring the whole thing isn&#x27;t really an option. The more changes that come through the more your elegant implementation becomes a series of hacks.<p>Soon they may start complaining asking why their &quot;small&quot; changes are taking so long to fix. This adds further budget pressure.<p>The problem is, it&#x27;s not very clear to people down in the weeds when implementing the small changes if it&#x27;s a hack or not. I think this is something that takes experience.  So even when you have cleanup be a blocking requirement,  taken one at a time it might seem fine and no large refactor is obvious until it becomes too large of a task to lump in a typical change request.<p>This is an especially easy trap to fall into for people who have been toiling away at the current design. They will have a blind spot/affinity for keeping as much of their implementation as possible and resist an overhaul.<p>If you have an iron will and a steely ice cold 1000 yard stare from 10 years of war in enterprise app development it&#x27;s easier for us to kill code because we don&#x27;t get attached to it as easily.<p>Be careful not to fall into the dark side though, (the flip side of those 10 years can instil a cold iron heart who stares right through the hacks and stops trying to argue with the client about doing things properly. In this scenario you just do as you are told and stop caring about the overall state of well-being of the codebase.)<p>The real art to web dev consulting is being able to build a flexible enough design to withstand these sorts of changes and still remain elegant and well thought out. It also takes the experience to know the difference between a hack and a proper change and the will power to do the right thing.  It&#x27;s really hard to do and it a good &quot;gut&quot; feeling for how a particular thing will actually be used, what a customer really means when they say something etc.  I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s something that can be taught. It leads right back to your brain dump wish.<p>Cheers",1450724150

This is a field with a pretty high rate of change in general, but every now and then, things change dramatically even by web programming standards, and we go through a period of technological uncertainty.  The last time I remember feeling this way was the rise of object relational mappers, dependency injection, model view controller frameworks, and various tag libraries on the front end[1] in javaland.  I remember from a previous HN discussion that there is a web counter measuring the number of days since the last javascript framework was released.  I remember feeling the same way about struts, struts2, spring MVC, tiles, tapestry, JPA, hibernate, ibatis, spring DI, pico, guice, and so forth…<p>Interestingly, much of this didn&#x27;t so much get resolved as swept aside - Ruby and Rails, Django, and a few other technologies &quot;appeared&quot; [1, again] at this moment.  I do remember feeling extremely grateful for ruby and rails, because I had started to hate programming.  It wasn&#x27;t the Java verbosity that I objected- I rather enjoyed programming with servlets/jsp and jdbc + the java web cookbook, and I never minded data structures and algorithms in Java - it was the churn and incredible amount of complexity just to do simple things that made me unhappy.  Rails got some bloat here and there, expand and consolidate, but I feel that it did accomplish its main goal, at least for me, which was that I felt happy and productive programming again.<p>Now, with the disruption of SPAs, we are clearly back in framework churn, and I&#x27;m not loving the model of writing the back end in rails-api and using a javascript front end.  I may warm up to this as my knowledge of javascript increases (and I certainly never minded going outside rails and writing sql, so I can&#x27;t really say I object to more than one language).  I&#x27;ve done a bit of ember, and it seems heavy to me, I have to duplicate so much routing, model, persistence, data tier work (I&#x27;m a noob, I may be doing it wrong, fully possible).  I don&#x27;t like looking at javascript as much as I like looking at ruby.  I also do remember feeling a bit frustrated with Rails in the beginning, before I understood it well enough to do an end-run around conventions, so like I said, I may really warm up to javascript frameworks.  But I really like Ruby, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with Rails (and if not rails, sinatra or something like that would be fine too).<p>Like I said earlier, I studied a lot of java-based MVC/DI/ORM approaches and ended up going with something that I hadn&#x27;t even considered (Rails).  I do think that in these highly transitional periods, this tends to happen - that you are surprised by the solution that ends up working for you.  At this point, it&#x27;s getting so speculative that I&#x27;m not highly confident in predicting things, but I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if the &quot;isometric&quot; transpiled languages (like ruby and opal) end up changing things dramatically (ie., just as I didn&#x27;t end up &quot;picking&quot; a java-based MVC/DI/ORM approach, I may not end up picking a javascript framework, I may end up surprised by a new and different approach).<p>[1] I understand these weren&#x27;t really &quot;new&quot; ideas, many of them (like a lot of CS) go back to the 1970s, but they hit the scene in that they became an issue in day to day development for ordinarliy up-to-date but not cutting edge web developers, the people who just wanted to get things done.",1450723825

A major evaluation of Tennessee’s publicly funded preschool system, published in September, found that although children who had attended preschool initially exhibited more “school readiness” skills when they entered kindergarten than did their non-preschool-attending peers, by the time they were in first grade their attitudes toward school were deteriorating. And by second grade they performed worse on tests measuring literacy, language, and math skills. The researchers told New York magazine that overreliance on direct instruction and repetitive, poorly structured pedagogy were likely culprits; children who’d been subjected to the same insipid tasks year after year after year were understandably losing their enthusiasm for learning.</i>",1450723553

This is who you are:<p>Barcode of smartphone use over two weeks.Black areas indicate times where the phone was in use and Saturdays are indicated with a red dashed line. Weekday alarm clock times (and snoozing) are clearly evident.<p>The Wall Street Journal reports today that Silicon Valley lending startups are looking to base personal loan decisions on analyses of data from individuals’ phones. The apps running on a person’s device, entrepreneurs have found, “generate huge amounts of data — texts, emails, GPS coordinates, social-media posts, retail receipts, and so on — indicating thousands of subtle patterns of behavior that correlate with repayment or default.” How you use your phone reveals more than you think:<p>Even obscure variables such as how frequently a user recharges the phone’s battery, how many incoming text messages they receive, how many miles they travel in a given day or how they enter contacts into their phone — the decision to add last name correlates with creditworthiness — can bear on a decision to extend credit.\nMeanwhile, the New York Times today reports on a new study published in Science that reveals how a person’s economic status can be determined through a fairly simple analysis of phone use. The researchers, working in Africa, collected details “about when calls were made and received and the length of the calls” as well as “when text messages were sent, and which cellphone towers the texts and calls were routed through.” They analyzed this metadata to “build an algorithm that predicts how wealthy or impoverished a given cellphone user is. Using the same model, the researchers were able to answer even more specific questions, like whether a household had electricity.”<p>I am not a number, you declare. I am more than a credit score. You may well be. But the tell-tale phone reveals more than one’s financial standing and trustworthiness. The tell-tale phone reveals all. Take a look at that chart again:<p>Barcode of smartphone use over two weeks.Black areas indicate times where the phone was in use and Saturdays are indicated with a red dashed line. Weekday alarm clock times (and snoozing) are clearly evident.<p>It shows the pattern of one person’s smartphone use over a two-week period, beginning late on a Friday afternoon. Each vertical line represents a single use of the phone, the width of the line showing how long the use extended. The chart comes from a new study on phone use, published in PLOS ONE. Four UK researchers installed a usage-tracking app on the smartphones of twenty-three students and staff members at the University of Lincoln, and then examined the data after two weeks. They discovered that “a simple measure — recording when the phone is in use — can provide a vast array of information about an individual’s daily routine.” Data on phone use, to take a simple example, provides “a non-invasive indication of sleep length.” All but one of the test subjects used their phones as an alarm clock on weekdays, and all of them without exception reported that the last thing they do before going to sleep is to check their phone. Gaps in use during the day are also good indicators of naps.<p>The test subjects used their phones more than five hours a day, on average. Much of that usage went on unconsciously, the researchers found. When the subjects were asked to estimate how often they checked their phone during a day, the average answer was 37 times. The tracking data revealed, however, that the subjects actually used their phones 85 times a day on average, more than twice as often as they thought. “For exploring checking behaviours,” the researchers report, “estimated number of uses show little reliability for measuring actual uses.” We see here how deeply entwined the phone has become with the self — a seamless extension of body, mind, and personality. It is so much a part of us that we are no more conscious of the device moment-to-moment than we are of, say, our hands.<p>If the mere tracking of phone use reveals how we spend our days, our diurnal routines, imagine what would be revealed by a deeper analysis, one that examined the apps we use, the people we connect with, the things we look at and listen to, what we say and what we write and what we like, where we go, what we search for, the photos we take. It’s all there, public self and private self. There’s no shame in admitting the fact: You are your phone.",1450723438

The Phoenix implementation is less lines of code (without counting the dependencies Rails brings in) while being more modular: the PubSub system is pluggable and we support multiple transports between client and server (WebSockets and LongPolling officially, embedded stuff coming soon™). Plus every Phoenix channel is concurrent and isolated. In the screencast, DHH says to avoid work on the channel to avoid blocking, in Phoenix you don&#x27;t have to worry about it, at all. In this particular scenario, we do much more with much less.<p>The most interesting of all is that not along ago I had similar expectations as you when it comes to certain parts of Phoenix like &quot;Phoenix.HTML&quot;. I was concerned that Phoenix.HTML would be more verbose than the Rails counterpart, both in implementation and usage. I was very pleasantly surprised when it was not the case. For example, check how we support different inputs in Phoenix (<a href=""https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_html/blob/master/lib/phoenix_html/form.ex"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_html/blob/master...</a>) and in Rails (<a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/tags"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actionview/lib/ac...</a>). In Phoenix, a new input is a simple function, in Rails it is a class with inheritance on its own file.<p>Those are just some examples from the top of my head and while I am still learning as I go, I have gathered enough mileage and evidence to expect things to be much simpler in the long term. :)",1450722996

Although finding the right title, position and salary is important, there’s another consideration that matters just as much: culture. The culture of a workplace — an organization’s values, norms and practices — has a huge impact on our happiness and success.&quot;<p>This is the framing statement of the article. I would like to dispute that there is a way to separate titles, positions, salaries, and &quot;culture&quot;. The &quot;culture&quot; of many places is to offer &quot;open plan seating&quot;, sweatshirts, jargon, memes, snacks, soda, gym membership, happy hours, a poor salary relative to the skills demanded, and work the employees to the bone until they&#x27;re burnt out. Stated differently: an organization&#x27;s actual values (above all, profit seeking) are usually not the same as its stated values and non sequitor doodads.  Typically, I hear people discussing &quot;how special/strong the culture is here&quot; in a cultlike way which sounds much like Stockholm syndrome to me. Sillicon Valley types are exceedingly prone to this kind of outward self-deception.<p>&quot;“Organizational cultures, and in particular stories, carry a claim to uniqueness — that an institution is unlike any other,” the researchers wrote. But paradoxically, the same stories occur “in virtually identical form, in a wide variety of organizations.”&quot;<p>Uh huh. That&#x27;s because the whole story of &quot;corporate culture&quot; does little to break up the humdrum fact that work needs to get done correctly, which means that it tends to be performed in a broadly similar fashion across an industry. The culture of working at a corporation as the primary mode of life is the corporate culture, and all instances of it will be chained to that fact, even if the details are different.<p>&quot;The M.I.T. professor Edgar H. Schein observes that the most visible parts of an organization’s culture are the artifacts and practices — how people talk, look and act. There are lots of organizations where people laugh at unique jokes, speak in unusual jargon, decorate their office spaces in unconventional ways, or have funky rules and norms. But the more defining parts of a culture are its values. Values are the principles people say are important and, more crucially, the principles people show are important through their actions.&quot;<p>The primary value of the corporation is profit-seeking, and there are many secondary values (customer service, quality assurance) that are directly related to this primary value. There is sometimes room for tertiary/aesthetic values to be more prominent in the minds and lives of the employees than the primary values; in these situations, we can say that there is a defined corporate culture. While a corporate culture may or may not evolve organically, its purpose is clear: vastly and cheaply increase employee productivity and retention.<p>In this sense, the article has a point: it&#x27;s better to work for a company that has a corporate culture because such arrangements tend to increase your satisfaction as an employee. But, as always, be cynical: when taken to its logical conclusion, the objective of a corporate culture is to keep you on board and working hard even if circumstances would cause you to leave. Whether organic or intentionally formed, a corporate culture serves the owners more than it serves you.",1450722780

Consider JavaScript, where it&#x27;s quite popular to power complex processes with simple JSON (maybe + extensions, like functions). The approach also works well in typed functional languages, albeit with greater declaration burden. Moreover, it would even work well in languages like Java, if you&#x27;re willing to buck the XML trend.<p>That said, data being a subset of code (which is also implied by equivalence) is what makes this technique much more popular in Lisps (and JavaScript). Being able to easily move forms between evaluation, quoting, interpretation, etc is critical to evolving the right approach.<p>Regarding whole program transforms: They don&#x27;t compose, at least not without a substantially more sophisticated macro system (like Racket&#x27;s) or evaluator (see work on &quot;extensible interpreters&quot;). Check out Racket&#x27;s rich literature on macros if you want to see the state of the art here.<p>Lastly, changing behavior based on context can be accomplished by many techniques including interpretation, dynamically scoped binding, etc. Read about Common Lisp&#x27;s condition system, or Eff&#x27;s &quot;Algebraic Effects and Handlers&quot; to see the state of the art of the dynamic substitution of effects. However, each new context needs to carefully reason about the interleaving of effects, since time is linear.<p>If you want more flexibility with time, you have to turn it in to space. That&#x27;s what happens when you take a step-by-step procedure and turn it in to data you can interpret. Consider code that prints a lot of stuff. Instead, you can return a lazy sequence of strings and then at the very end do something like `(apply str parts)` to concatenate it all together. Now that each sub-printer doesn&#x27;t have side effects, you can re-order and refactor the calls without worrying about messing up the printed output. You&#x27;ve decoupled the evaluation timeline from the linear order of the output.",1450722467

A common element of all the comparative species selected is that their life span in the wild is far shorter than our own, and there isn&#x27;t going to be selection pressure happening before they would accumulate UV damage.  UV damage to the eye is kind of like yellowing of plastics, it accumulates over time.  As is pointed out in your first linked article, aphakia patients are advised to wear blue-blocking glasses to protect their vision.  My first thought as to how bad could it be was retinoblastoma—I am not aware of any studies looking at the incidence rate of Rb in aphakia patients and PubMed doesn&#x27;t show anything either, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an unreasonable thought.<p>Aside from the ionization problem, UV light also has a much higher propensity towards scatter.  Floaters are bad enough for some in visible light!  Of course, we&#x27;re talking futuristic gene augmentation, so it&#x27;s not unreasonable to suggest we&#x27;d vacuum the eyes out every now and then, so maybe floaters will not be a problem :) We still have a problem with the much higher dispersion of UV light relative to visible, given the materials we have to work with in the eye; that, plus scatter, means we&#x27;re probably going to have very fuzzy UV vision.  Replace the whole lens system and maybe you get better UV-vis vision, but we still haven&#x27;t overcome the safety problem.  Maybe instead of vacuuming out the eyes, we just swap them out for a new autologous gene-tweaked set every couple years.<p>NIR would seem to be more realistic than UV (certainly considering safety), but here, the quantum efficiency of the pigments would seem to be a limiting factor.  As you point out, we can already actually see a little into NIR (IIRC, in scotopic with something like 10<i></i>-6 QE at 750nm relative to 555nm).  At first glance, the chemical structure of human receptor pigments doesn&#x27;t look to be super favorable for modification to getting something that would have a good absorption cross-section in NIR.  Compare the structure of vitamin A or retinal with a strongly NIR-active chromophore, there&#x27;s a lot of steps bridging the two and the structure as a whole is hostile towards selective modifications, not to speak of the rings where the modifications need to happen.<p>As to thermal IR, I think we&#x27;d need a metamaterial for something that would work in vis and in LWIR, and that&#x27;s a  handwavey statement on my part.  It would definitely be of interest to the military!<p>Overall, I think it&#x27;s more plausible to augment our vision by wiring a camera directly into our visual cortex.

10772362,comment,10767973,10770058,0,0,derefr,,,"RSS tells you what&#x27;s actually a new page. Usually, if a site wants to be Google-friendly, it&#x27;ll have a page for every new content item—so, if a site publishes an RSS feed, that&#x27;s usually enough to &quot;chunk&quot; their content by time.<p>Heuristics to decide what&#x27;s new on a site are much, much harder to code than heuristics to extract content when you&#x27;re explicitly told what&#x27;s new. There was a service called Dapper, who tried the &quot;extract content from a CSS-selector-specified zone of a page when content changes&quot; approach... and it didn&#x27;t go well. Yahoo Pipes had similar aspirations; again, got shuttered.<p>There are always sites that are really bad internet citizens. Some sites just change their front page to update, without creating a canonical archival URL—so then, if they <i>do</i> publish an RSS feed, every item is just a link back to said front page. There&#x27;s not much you can do in these cases beyond just crowdsourcing &quot;parsers for hundreds of sites&quot; (which does happen—webcomics being a frequent and horrifying example.)<p>But there is a pretty good alternative, I think: if you can scrape the site itself <i>as a whole</i> at regular intervals, with fine enough granularity that any two contiguous scrapes will detect either 0 or 1 change, then you can <i>probably</i> convert that into a useful RSS feed without trying to figure out from &quot;what changed&quot; from DOM deltas. Basically, shove each scrape into the working index of a git repo, commit, and generate an RSS feed of the diffs. (Wikipedia can give you this in some form; I think gwern.net has an RSS feed that also basically works this way.) And, if the site has even the most minimal source RSS feed, you don&#x27;t need the &quot;regular intervals&quot; approach: you can use the source RSS feed to provide &quot;cueing&quot; information (i.e. timestamps of when the site has changed) for your scrapes.<p>Which is all to say, RSS is a very &quot;utilitarian&quot; format. You don&#x27;t need to rely on all of this processing happening on the server side, but rather can just take one RSS feed, and then use whatever bits of it you want to generate another RSS feed, and then someone can consume <i>that</i> RSS feed and write a heuristic to generate cluster and combine the feed items from it into higher-level summaries, etc.<p>This sort of thing really shows the &quot;theme&quot; of RSS, to me. RSS wasn&#x27;t really designed or intended for direct consumption by readers, but rather to make it easy to have <i>something</i> on your site (even your statically-generated site, or your crap one-off PHP blog) that&#x27;s easy for other services to consume and <i>turn into</i> stuff. It&#x27;s &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;: it&#x27;s not the whole process of getting stuff to clients, it&#x27;s just the lowest barrier-to-entry to get the <i>supply</i>-side of the equation involved, so that well-made <i>delivery infrastructure</i> can take over from there.<p>There were never meant to be &quot;RSS reader&quot; software, really, or even e.g. consume-side RSS-to-email gateways. Instead, RSS was meant to be lowest-common-denominator format for other supplier-side services to consume. Instead of writing &quot;lifecycle emails&quot;, for example, you were meant to just have your web app generate a lifecycle notification stream RSS feed for each user—and then subscribe an emailing service to it.<p>We&#x27;ve replaced this behavior, for the most part, with webhooks—having our web-apps actually reach out using a REST client and prod other services&#x27; APIs. But RSS (with <i>one</i> consumer—the hooked service) is much, much cheaper than a REST client, from all perspectives: your web-app can likely already generate XML, it likely already has a list of changes and &quot;view rendering&quot; capabilities, etc. Webhooks are for the 1% of apps that can both 1. run server-side, 2. reach-out from their sandboxes to poke something elsewhere on the web, and 3. have a public URL where they can be poked back at. An RSS-based pub-sub event system, meanwhile, will work even if the event-generator is on your local machine: as long as you proxy over the RSS feed URL itself, you don&#x27;t need to worry about machines trying to figure out whether the site that prodded them with a webhook request is coming from the right IP for that client or not, etc. They just get to blindly consume a URL, like any other piece of idiomatic web software.",1450720931

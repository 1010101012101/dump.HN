If you give an hourly rate + an estimate clients seem to be cool, provided they are actual businessses. The only clients I&#x27;ve ever had issues with are individuals (usually artists since I freelance electronic media) and that stems from budget / rampant psychotic narcissism. But with businesses, I state my rate I estimate hours & then I bill them.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is a more secure way of handling this with contracts but if a company I work remotely for ever stiffs me on a bill:\n1. They better be closing up shop the next day or I&#x27;m gonna come after them hard.\n2. They lose access to the skills I offer them.\n3. I probably have accounts/services in their name that they can&#x27;t alter/operate without my help, so they&#x27;re really just shooting themselves in the foot & will likely come to realize this rather quickly.<p>Anyway worst case scenario I lose 1 payment (maybe it was 1-3 grand?).

Even if I one day lose a thousand dollars (which I highly doubt) I can look back and smile knowing I never had to deal with a ton of legalese.<p>The reality of it is that businesses can&#x27;t just stiff you on a bill if they agreed to pay for your services, and if you have nice clients who are trying to build a business they have no reason to hurt you if you do good work for them.

Look at the first snippet; here the programmer assumed pointer arithmetic behaves like arithmetic in a register where overflow results in wrapping.  This might be a reasonable assumption, but this isn&#x27;t what the spec says.  Now you could argue that this should be the defined behavior (and perhaps I would agree), because this is what many programmers will expect.<p>But sooner or later you&#x27;ll come across a programmer who isn&#x27;t aware of wrapping and wrongly assumes the value can only grow when a positive integer is added to it.  So you could define a language which silently does bignums and all is well, except now you have to deal with memory allocation (this can be a major issue on memory-constrained platforms) during integer arithmetic, and the way bignum computations affect the program&#x27;s performance & timing (crypto side channel attacks anyone?).  So the next programmer again has to know the pitfalls of the Defined behavior and Do The Right Thing, just as he must do now with Undefined Behavior (i.e. rearrange bounds checking and pointer arithmetic so that it&#x27;ll never point beyond one past the last element of an array; and so that your signed integers never overflow).<p>The second snippet (pointer dereference before NULL check) is perhaps more subtle, and again I might agree that the language would be safer if it didn&#x27;t allow the removal of the NULL check that would keep this incorrect code from doing further harm.  However, no matter what your proposed defined behavior for NULL/invalid pointer dereferencing is (what would it be? I have no idea), there would likely be cases where the programmer makes the wrong assumption and his program relying on that Defined behavior is still incorrect and potentially insecure.<p>Simply defining undefined behavior just doesn&#x27;t fix incorrect code.  You still have to remove the broken (undefined or not) code from the codebase...<p>EDIT: If you meant to suggest languages whose compiler will abort if it finds code that might result in undefined behavior, well, that&#x27;s much harder.  UB in C is predominantly a run-time issue, so you&#x27;d be making a really smart static analyzer to detect at compile time whether your code can actually hit UB.  Did someone solve the halting problem?  Alternatively you can make a language where integers never overflow.  Then we get to what I said about bignums and surprise-allocation and such..

I selected R initially because it had the only good autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) calculation that was good and also fast that was requested by my users to do some data extrapolation.  I could see its promise but I&#x27;ll be damned if it wasn&#x27;t the most annoying language to use for general things like accessing a database to get the data.  I eventually got it everything to work but it was not easy to automate and deploy.<p>Ultimately the ARMA calc didn&#x27;t do what they wanted mostly because ARMA was the wrong thing to use on the dataset in the first place, IMNSHO. This could my general lack of experience with R but I&#x27;ve been programming for 15+ years and it was one of the rougher languages to work with.<p>Anyway I ported the code to python, numpy, scipy, scikits (and most significantly the time series stuff) and it was much easier to pull in the data an apply smoothing filters and do some general data clean up work but the ARMA was nowhere to be seen and I settled for simple linear and quadratic fits and think it did a better job of forecasting.  I really liked some things that R did automatically like when trending data it added confidence intervals on the forecasts.  I was actually tempted to port the ARMA libraries to python over this but didn&#x27;t want to dedicate the time to debug and validate it.  R was really good for interactive manipulation but python was better for actual deployment.",1384713312

Lots of minors use youtube and have extensive histories of liked videos and comments tied to their youtube account.<p>3.  Google made an unexpected change from anonymity to requiring a linked Google+ account for commenting.<p>4.  Google+ profile pics are automatically displayed alongside comments.  This applies retroactively to all comments, not just ones made after the Google+ requirement change.<p>5.  youtube users, even technical ones, may not be able to figure out how to workaround the problem of wanting a separate youtube profile pic from their Google+ profile pic.<p>6.

The problem is that not much people (after al these years...) know how to guide and manage a team in Indian; it&#x27;s just not the same as here. Most companies (I saw this recently at HP and Accenture for instance) think you can just chuck stuff over the fence to India and expect something back which works. You&#x27;ll be lucky that way if it even compiles (it usually doesn&#x27;t if the project is done by more than a few people)!<p>I think the &#x27;defense&#x27; in this article is weird though; as a humanitarian the circumstances feel bad; as a company owner; what do I care who goes to work in what way? If you deliver bad stuff you don&#x27;t get work. The reason why is of no interest to me in this case as I personally cannot help fix it. Maybe I can, but at a cost equal or the same to hiring people who can sit next to me in my office and that was not really the idea now, was it?<p>Actually ; the fact that everyone knows this already makes it even weirder that every big company is outsourcing the crown jewels to those countries. And then come back &#x27;home&#x27; crying. It&#x27;s just irresponsible towards the clients and local workers.<p>That said; you can train mostly anyone and manage quality anywhere, but it&#x27;s just harder than &#x27;in the same office&#x27; until you have the process perfected. This means you going to India and spending a few years with your team establishing training ,education, process suited to your company. Companies work with people like me to set that up if they don&#x27;t send people themselves. One of the worst things I see is companies who go once, meet the native guy they selected as boss there and then never go back (most work like that in my experience).<p>It&#x27;s just investment in people (and your company); it&#x27;s not much cheaper (or at least much) than programmers locally if you want to do it well.

This kind of user is not so attractive to competitive, profitable companies. They don&#x27;t add much but they cost much time, trouble, energy, money. If these users go away no company really bothers, even if these are 90% of the users. (keep in mind, I&#x27;m one of these troublesome users)<p>B.) Users that actually pay might not be unhappy with the results. E.g. a company that buys advertisement space from google will not mind if Google processes the user information more efficiently. Also a Google business account owner will not mind that his employees can&#x27;t watch Youtube videos from his account that would be shameful to show publicly. Therefore I think the bigger part of the interesting cutomers might actually approve of the current changes.<p>C) Most users have not much power.

On some configuration values I would say the default would suffice as well, but mentioning what can be configured might also be helpful.<p>However, from experience, setting up a database is overkill for a small mail server instance hosting only a few mail boxes. It&#x27;s way easier to use system user accounts (just disable remote login for them). That avoids the hassles of setting up the virtual mail delivery. Only for a large mail server using a database backend would make sense to gain more performance.",1384711448

A number of folks have started learning about Linux system administration with theirs after being somewhat &#x27;light weight&#x27; in that department. Others are learning about new programming languages or environments, from node.js, to R, to Scratch, to python. Getting Docker on them has had people setting up server deploys. Running web servers have people creating small web sites with bootstrap and other technologies.<p>But if you really aren&#x27;t interested in learning those sorts of things, well its not really very useful. Everything it does can be done &#x27;better&#x27; in a production environment by a server, usually x86 based, designed to do what ever it is it is doing.<p>Bottom line is there are a lot of things an RPi can help you learn by giving you hands on experience. If you&#x27;re not interested in learning those things, it probably isn&#x27;t all that useful.",1384711240

He learns how to use the software from other people showing him how to do stuff.<p>The Power User: He has deeper needs, but can only be bothered to use features 1 or 2 levels deep in the GUI. Like pivot tables, vlookups and index/match, logical operator formulas in Excel. He learns how to use the software from tutorials.<p>The Advanced User: He has a task and does not mind getting his hands dirty in order to fix it. Uses DAX and Cube formulas. Perhaps even Macros. He learns by googling his problem and reading documentation.<p>The Developer: Solves the problems at the programmatic level.<p>Tableau occupies a very specific spot. It is brilliant for the User who only consumes dashboards via clicking on them. No explanation needed and it is super polished. It is also powerful enough for the Advanced User who can perform relatively sophisticated analyses from the interface. Generally speaking, it is not a good fit for the Power User who doesn&#x27;t have the need to justify using it.

11048071,comment,11042482,11047894,0,0,infinite8s,,,"Yes, completely agreed. There&#x27;s a continuum of UX between BI tools like Tableau/Qlikview and the interactive prompts used by most data scientists (mainly around the non-interactivity of display)- it&#x27;s sad that an 80 character static tty display is still the state of the art in that space. While I&#x27;m very comfortable in ipython/terminal I often wish I could easily pop up a Tableau interface on top of my pandas analysis. Jupyter is getting there slowly but the widgets people are building are still more geared toward display than interacting with data (both original and derived) directly. Even the new set of SAAS BI tools (Looker, Mode, etc) leave interaction as a secondary concern. I think that&#x27;s the main difference between tools geared towards reporting/publishing (most of the BI world) and tools geared toward data analysis (R, python, etc). As you point out, the tools for data analysis are years behind the BI tools in terms of UI/UX (or their focus is more on IDEs for developers rather than analysts).<p>As a side note, I&#x27;ve been following your work for a while now (both Superconductor and Graphistry) - mind if I shoot you a few questions privately?",1454772360

However, scammers don&#x27;t respect it, so you&#x27;ll still occasionally get calls. Also, businesses with a &quot;previous relationship&quot; can call you. I once had to threaten a car dealer with legal action to get them to stop calling (I had test driven a car). A related problem I had was that I got a phone number that formerly belonged to a deadbeat. There were constant calls from debt collectors. It took about two years to convince them that they had the wrong number. Well, actually, most of them were pretty good because they can get in a lot of legal trouble if they harass the wrong person, but then the company would sell the debt to another company, and the calls would start again.",1454772307

You better bluff all the way to the end and if your hand is better then you win.<p>Most people can look at payscale or glassdoor though.

When someone comes in the game they&#x27;re playing is &quot;let me convince you why I&#x27;m worth the upper end of the range (or even a bit more)&quot;, and my game is &quot;let me get you down to the lower end of the range by convincing you how awesome we are, etc.&quot; The underlying assumption is that our mental ranges overlap somewhat.

Money is a type of medium of exchange, it possesses certain qualities that other media do not.<p>You make money first by creating the tangible / intangible artifacts of that exchange, like currency, systems of accounting, and such. You then get other people to use the system to exchange goods and services.<p>This typically requires a government, but other entities have made money in the past, and even today. Bitcoin satisfies all the criteria of money.<p>The practice of fractional-reserve banking is another example of money creation. Most banks will lend out more money than they have access to in deposits, as a relatively safe form of leverage.<p>This has the effect of slightly expanding how much money is available to the economy, aggregated over all the banks and loans being made by those banks, the expansion is significant.<p>Things like video game currencies also satisfy all the criteria of money, though the things you can buy with them are limited, sometimes you can trade them for other currencies.<p>So there&#x27;s lots of ways to make money.",1454772089

Other things can change over their lifecycle too. At one point, we had separate types for each stage in the lifecycle, a bit like your different types for insert and read, but that makes it impossible to write any kind of code which is stage-agnostic - so for example you need a separate to-string function for each stage.<p>We were working in Scala, and I had a go at solving this using a higher-kinded type for the ID and other changing fields:<p><a href=""https://github.com/tim-group/higher-kinded-lifecycle/blob/master/src/main/scala/Idea.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tim-group/higher-kinded-lifecycle/blob/ma...</a><p>The idea is that if you say that the ID is of type &#x27;T of String, where T is some subtype of Option&#x27;, then you can bind T to None for entities that haven&#x27;t been saved, Some for ones which have, and Option where you have a mixture. You then have one type definition, with which you can write stage-agnostic code, but static guarantees about whether there&#x27;s an ID.<p>You can go further and use type constraints to enforce the order of lifecycle stages: if your object can only be saved to the database once it&#x27;s been given a timestamp, say, you can make sure that the ID type can only be Some if the timestamp type is also Some.<p>So maybe when Rust gets HKTs it&#x27;ll be time for a new release!",1454771077

The time wasted for the headhunter is negligible compared to that of both the employer and candidate.  This is why I want to know the rough ranges at the onset.

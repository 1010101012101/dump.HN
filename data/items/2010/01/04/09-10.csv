The high level beauty of Federers game can be seen even from Tennis newbies. With his smooth movement, it looks like he has an additional second of time. Where other players struggle with intense footwork, he seemingly floats around the court (probably best seen with his great inside-out shoot).<p>If you get a chance to seem them, probably some of the best modern matches are:<p>* ATP Wimbledon Final 2007 & 2008: Federer - Nadal<p>* ATP Australian Open Semi: Nadal - Verdasco<p>[1] from Aug. 2006, a time where Federer hasn't yet topped the Grand Slam record of Sampras",1262598605

Good drivers make sure that they always have an out, check their mirrors and blind spots as often as possible, stay safely away from other drivers, and do their best to control the situation. Adept use of brakes and speed can control how far people stay from you, as well as your position within a lane. These are skills every motorcyclist learns very, very quickly.",1262597852

1030054,comment,1029730,1029756,0,0,w00pla,,,"I have a huge problem with this edition of IEEE spectrum. It seems as if the editor tried to turn the version of IEEE spectrum into a political activist magazine (it is supposed to be a technical magazine for electronic and electric engineers covering technological developments, etc…).<p>The main article in that edition is “Powerless in Gaza” which is more political than technical (even if it were technical, it is not relevant).<p>Another article is supposed to be about Finland’s nuclear waste disposal system (by Sandra Upson) – which could have been extremely interesting if it wasn’t for the author’s completely unscientific anti-nuclear rant. This ridiculous article was discussed elsewhere: <a href=""http://www.theresilientearth.com/?q=content/crank-week-december-14-2009-sandra-upson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theresilientearth.com/?q=content/crank-week-decem...</a><p>The “Math Quiz: Why do men predominate” is also one of those political articles.

1030046,comment,1029406,1029723,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"If you want to go back to Kant (my grasp is a bit shaky but it will do), the reason we care about conscious beings over non-conscious beings/things is because they are the source of the ""good will"" and produce value in the world. The world is dark and valueless without thinking being to grant value to the valueless. If dolphins are conscious, then they too are sources of the ""good will"" and are deserving of treatment befitting of it.<p>However, Kant's philosophy leads to some strange places if you push it too far (like all philosophies). I think humans innately combine a mix of Utilitarianism with Kantianism to come up with intuitive judgements - which is a pretty obvious and useless statement, but if we take it at face value it means that when we are confronted with extrema, we would do well to consider both sides of the coin.",1262596305

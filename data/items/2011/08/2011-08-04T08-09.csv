When I bought a new laptop (few months ago) which came with W7 too, it took it about an hour (on the first run) to install some vendor (HP) crapware, randomly popping up old-fashioned term windows running a lot of text, before I could use it, anyhow; it ended up with some something. I didn't even know how to connect to my wifi, there were two very different (both in appearance and behavior) widgets for that, fighting each other. The interface was, on the first sight, very polished and rather nice, but after first few minutes, I started to spot things that looked like leftovers from Windows 98, most likely, they were. To actually do something, I had to download some 3rd parties software packages, none of them really fitted into the W7 environment. Three completely different fileselectors on the screen at one time? W7 problem too, obviously.<p>Well, I'm not making definite conclusions from what I saw, it was just something like 4 hours and I bought the laptop to use with Linux anyway, so I didn't really want to use Windows even if I liked them more than I actually did. But I really tried to approach it without prejudices and bias. And I really think that it's stuck in 1990's. 20 years before OS X and now even Gnome 3.

One went to college because he/she wanted to learn stuff which will be useful on his/her voyage to the frontiers of human knowledge.  Intellectual curiosity is the main motivating factor for this kind of people.<p>College education today assumes the same role that high-school education had 60 years ago, and it's NOT because there's more stuff that has to be learned.

The idea that America is somehow special, possessed of some manifest destiny and unable to lose has been so deeply engrained in the American psyche, and for so long, that even now the notion of failure seems too fanciful to enter the common narrative.  America is not special.  It's been favoured by politics and luck, but there's nothing keeping it on top besides continued prosperity.  Look at Japan for an example of what could easily happen: a high-tech economy with a massive banking and manufacturing sector, that collapsed then...never really restarted.  There are, in fact, many parallels between the Japanese and American recessions.  While Japan is still a massive innovator, the benefits have not trickled down to the average Japanese citizen.  China long ago took over as the biggest economy in Asia, and could easily supplant the US globally if current trends continue.<p>To face these challenges, the US has...Congress.  The leadership vacuum in Washington is downright depressing.  Amidst bitter political bickering, the disaffected masses turn to the demagoguery of the Tea Party, further perpetuating the political morass.  Can anyone see a viable, <i>achievable</i> solution?  Cutting the deficit is critically important, yet any proposed method of doing so seems likely to hurt the economy at a time when it simply can't take it. Everything seems poised to get much worse before it gets better.",1312445867

I think the original stimulus would have had a better impact if it had included a lot more infrastructure investments than ""give a man a fish"" type expenditures. I'm not a student of economics, and I won't try to pretend to be one on this forum, but haven't we run out of Keynesian options if we want to continue with the current economic policies?<p>Nate Silver's leading line above makes me think of Germany [1]. They were the only government to take a position of austerity, were widely criticized for it, but they're the only major Western economy that rebounded from the economic crisis.

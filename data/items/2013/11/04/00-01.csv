In theory, DDG can become the hub around which we access a whole variety of niche search engines, each time choosing which one is best suited to the task at hand. I think that encourages a fundamentally healthy ecosystem.<p>It would be even better if they could play up that element a bit more, if they could make the different search options in a particular area more discoverable.

You&#x27;d think that &quot;it&#x27;s just an API, how close-minded can they get?&quot; The answer is very. I&#x27;ve dealt with these types of integrations before as part of a large corporation, and I&#x27;ve seen API documentation from a partner prefixed by 2 full pages of legalese regarding its use - and that doesn&#x27;t include the separate document about data retention and caching restrictions. And it&#x27;s even more of a pipe dream to think that any party could convince these institutions to simplify or standardize their APIs - the legal fees alone for them to make sure that everything&#x27;s compatible with EACH company&#x27;s practices/bylaws would probably strike fear into even the most generous donor.

For example, just a couple that come up off the top of my head:<p>* API Standardization issues<p>- Many of these companies likely have custom sets of data that they expect, validation rules, their own auth procedures that they&#x27;d be hesitant to let go of etc...\n- Smaller companies (such as in my ECSI example) would likely shy away from the costs of creating such an API for their own services, thus still resulting in the need for custom solutions\n- Larger companies would also hesitate to change - either due to their own org/system complexity, or just a desire to not spend money on something that doesn&#x27;t feel core to their business.  Healthcare integration standardization is <i>severely</i> hampered by this, for example.\n- Many of these companies may actually be charging for access to their data backend, which would still thwart the use of standardized APIs even after they were adopted.<p>* FOSS System Issues<p>- To create the integrations, companies would have to actually both expose it to you and allow you access.  The creators of the FOSS system would have to somehow convince these companies to essentially open up their systems to the world.  That would be fantastic I think, but it would be very tough to convince companies.\n- You&#x27;d need a large number of dedicated people to the cause - and not just developers to create and maintain the integrations, but also people with the skills needed to negotiate with the businesses for whatever kinds of back-end deals have to occur to keep the integration online and functional on the financial institution&#x27;s side.  So far, we&#x27;ve been good at finding an army of excellent developers to drive FOSS - for this kind of integration pursuit, the FOSS movement would also need to be good at finding an army of excellent businessmen, lawyers, etc... that would be as dedicated and available as the software development force (I&#x27;d be all for such an expansion of scope in the Open Source movement)\n- The &quot;charging for access&quot; issue above would still be a problem here.<p>Now, none of these are reasons not to do it - merely a statement of risks and a peek into the scope and effort needed for such an approach.  It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d ever have the time or energy to lead the charge on personally, but kudos to whoever could rally the army (and the political will) needed to make it happen.",1383525945

Meanwhile, quantum networks and computing is being rolled out to big institutional investors.<p>The only way for people to regain any semblance of control (and transparency) of their financial situation, there has to be an FOSS initiative to build these tools openly, and to keep them on a license that prevents huge financial institutions from coopting public commons software.  The fact that Mint can&#x27;t seem to tally a month is indicative of deeply failed architecture, probably governed by business instead of engineers.  If that doesn&#x27;t scare you, well, perhaps you are already in debt up to your eyeballs, and as they say, if I owe you $1,000 it&#x27;s my problem, if I owe you $1,000,000 it&#x27;s your problem.<p>There is NO WAY for a startup to tackle the problem and make meaningful advancements in any metric except maybe a nice zero-sum race with Mint.  At least not that I can see.  No one is going to fund a startup deving under GPL2 and no startup staying private with their technology will be able to out-compete Mint&#x27;s headstart, because any advancement you have with the banks is Mint&#x27;s for free.

At least I couldnt find any.<p>Edit: Ok, I think I figured it or at least something out by looking at the release history.

Brushes last update is similarly already a year old.<p>Time really does fly, it feels to me like I was using Inkpad just recently and that is was very much actively developed.

To compete with Mint at this point, you&#x27;d have to offer similar levels of integration with banks, credit card companies, investment companies etc...<p>The problem is that there are literally tens of thousands of these companies, each exposing their own APIs and each with their own unique caveats as to data they require, throttling limits, back-room deals for access, hesitation to even let people access their systems etc.<p>For an anecdotal end-user example, I have an account with one provider who refuses to cooperate with Mint in integrating - ECSI.  This is a small lending company for student loans, one of thousands of such companies.  They decided for reasons that are not publicly available to not even allow Mint to integrate with them anymore, after having let them do so for the first couple of years.  What sorts of negotiations were occurring in the back end between these companies, and what caused it to fall apart?  The public doesn&#x27;t know, but needless to say there was <i>some</i> level of custom integration effort for them, <i>some</i> level of business negotiation, and then finally something fell apart and made customers mad as a result.  Now, all of this integration work and business negotiation had to happen between Mint and ECSI - and that is just one of the tens of thousands of companies out there.  It is a very tall order to ask a new company to come forward and make that much upfront work in order to get on par with Mint so that it can start competing.<p>The real fight that would make more innovation in the field would probably have to start with getting companies to standardize and expose their APIs without (or with common and well understood) strings attached.  If this happened - as has been struggling but slowly improving in the Healthcare field - it&#x27;ll become more feasible for a company to realistically compete with Mint.  And <i>then</i> you can get to those enhanced features that Mint suffers for want of.  (however, at that point Mint&#x27;s significant engineering force could be redirected from integration efforts to these same features, and then you&#x27;ll find yourself fighting against a much larger machine now bent on feature improvement)",1383524245

It&#x27;s a core part of Windows, rather than something supplied by each program.<p>The console system doesn&#x27;t provide a TTY, as in Unix, but instead uses a CGA/MDA text mode metaphor: a matrix of (character,colour) pairs. This leaves no information about the text that&#x27;s been printed, per se - it&#x27;s more like the text equivalent of a bitmap. No carriage returns, no tabs, just an arrangement of characters that happened to have been put in the right places. If you widen the screen, there&#x27;s not much Windows can do except for leave the new area blank, because it has no idea at all which line breaks are significant and which were just wrapped. (And indeed, if you resize the buffer in the console window&#x27;s properties, this blanking is exactly what it does.)<p>There&#x27;s sort-of nothing wrong with this system, in that it makes sense for a certain style of text-mode GUI console program, that were at one point exceedingly popular in MS-DOS - but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not so hot for the TTY style of console program that everybody uses these days :)<p>(Fingers crossed for a much-needed shakeup, but this nonsense has stuck around for so long - I don&#x27;t think that console properties dialog has changed one pixel since Windows NT 4 - that it&#x27;s probably a bit late now.

They&#x27;ll ask their parents to buy them? Maybe buy them themselves? Okay. Maybe not a prudent choice, time is wasted, a little bit of money is wasted... but the trajectory of life is very rarely totally devastated because of this. This is unlikely to happen anyway, considering there are already safeguard measures set up in society to prevent things going wrong: kids can&#x27;t buy Mature-rated game, they typically don&#x27;t have money anyway... parents have to make decisions for them. Mentally challenged adults have very little, if any, resources and safeguards to save them from making poor decisions.<p>I accept that it&#x27;s only a certain part of the market in which participating adults are not mentally intelligent enough to make informed decisions. You (apparently) accept that only a small part of marketing (dolls) to children is a problem (though rayiner seems to be totally against marketing to children altogether -- and it was to that point that my original reply was to).<p>It would seem that we two should agree on a conclusion: advertising for all needs to be re-thought fundamentally. Cut out sexism, racism, sexual appeals in ads, as well as the wide variety of carefully, psychologically constructed ads in adult market, and cut out advertising highly sexualized dolls.<p>I want to make a note that only these sexualized dolls are problematic. If you have a daughter you know that girls just prefer dolls and other girly things in an innate way (I&#x27;m practically a daddy of two, and despite all my trying to get them hooked on cars, action heroes, computers, they just always opt for the dolls when given the choice).

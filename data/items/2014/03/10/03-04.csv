The new device would not survive a catastrophic breakup. Nor would it receive the omniscient breadth of data trusted to a black box. Instead, it would (1) receive a subset of flight data (e.g. location, alerts, and pilot inputs) and (2) immediately send them to a ground-based datacentre.

Those were the big 3 10+ years ago, and probably still will be.  This isn&#x27;t some magical &#x27;hidden&#x27; info that a handful of security consultants hoard to themselves to maximize top dollar.<p>Have safe password/authentication systems, prevent XSS, prevent CSRF and prevent SQL injection - you&#x27;d prevent a HUGE number of attacks for little effort.  But... it takes education, and actually caring some about your job/company/product.<p>&quot;Also, there really is no place to hire a ``security person&#x27;&#x27; at a early stage startup. &quot;  Why not?  I don&#x27;t think they need &#x27;hiring&#x27; full time.  Many startups spend inordinate amount of time on &#x27;user experience&#x27; and &#x27;branding&#x27; and whatnot, with the (correct) understanding that you can&#x27;t easily just &#x27;add on&#x27; UX after the fact - it&#x27;s much easier to develop UX as part of the overall dev process.  Why do people not think of security the same way?  Regular security audits/reviews by a security consultant (1-3 hours every week or so) would go a long way towards helping inexperienced developers spot gaping/obvious security holes well before they become big problems.",1394423191

To be honest, I don&#x27;t think there is much information in Chinese politics and economy worth reading. The tools we use are outdated.

7371135,comment,7369999,7370739,5,0,JangoSteve,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a solid security background, but there are four best-practices I can think of that would have prevented the security vulnerabilities outlined by this post:<p>1. Hash the secret API token/key given to each client that is sent to the server with each API request. This will prevent attackers from being able to find out your secret token.<p>If you only hash the secret token though, this still won&#x27;t help, as attackers could just send other API requests along with the hashed token. Instead, you will want the client to hash other data unique to the specific API request as well. For example:<p><pre><code>    http://api.example.com/api_function_name?app_id=my_app&hash={hash_value}&other=stuff\n</code></pre>\nWhere the hash_value is computed by the client with something like:<p><i>EDIT: Clarified hash_function parameters, thanks @eru.</i><p><pre><code>    hash_function( secret_key, api_function_name)\n</code></pre>\nThe API server will then receive the request, look up the client&#x27;s secret_key based on the app_id, and run the same hash_function to make sure it matches hash_value in the request.<p>This would mean attackers couldn&#x27;t reuse the hashed value to send other API calls. But they&#x27;d still be able to send calls to that function and just change the parameters to the call to get other information from that API call. So, you could also include the other API call parameters in the hash_function as well, which would mean attackers could only replay that exact API call and not change any of the parameters.<p>You might notice, this is still not good. So, to prevent this &quot;replay attack&quot;, you would also generally include the current datetime in the API call as well:<p><pre><code>    hash_function( secret_key, api_function_name, datetime )\n</code></pre>\nNow, attackers can&#x27;t even replay the exact request, because by the time they do, the datetime will have changed and so the API server would reject the request if it was replayed later. And since the attacker still doesn&#x27;t know the unhashed secret_key (since it&#x27;s never been transmitted in plain text), they can&#x27;t change the datetime without invalidating the hash_value.<p>This is theoretical though, because in reality the above wouldn&#x27;t work well if the clocks on the client and server were at all out of sync (and they probably will be). So, usually, you&#x27;d also have to include the current datetime of the request as another parameter in the call to let the server know exactly what datetimestamp was used in the hash_function, and the server will simply make sure the datetime is within an acceptable window of the current datetime on the server. Of course, the bigger the window, the easier to get the API working with clients, but the larger the window for allowing replay attacks.<p><pre><code>    http://api.example.com/api_function_name?app_id=my_app&hash={hash_value}&other=stuff&time=datetime\n</code></pre>\nAnd lastly, the chosen hash_function for the API should be something not easy to brute-force (meaning don&#x27;t make it easy for attackers to listen to a few API calls and be able to reverse-engineer the secret_key, since they&#x27;ll already know what hash_function is from the API documentation).<p>OK, 1 was longer than I anticipated, but the others are pretty short.<p>2. Another more full-proof way to prevent attackers from getting secret tokens, hashed or unhashed, would be to make all API requests work only via HTTPS.<p>3. Don&#x27;t provide API (or any) access to user passwords.<p>4. Don&#x27;t store user passwords in plain-text, or even via simple hashes. Instead use a cryptographically secure hashing function with salts.",1394421567

In both the US/FDR case and Japan&#x27;s, I believe the infrastructure spending was seen as a way to re-ignite growth while also creating something long lasting.<p>There certainly is some truth to the long lasting piece. A country with poor infrastructure will have a very difficult time growing. What is controversial is building things either few people use or are far more expensive than they should be. On the flip side, infrastructure has to be serviced to remain viable. In addition to using money that is &quot;borrowed&quot; one way or the other, the maintenance cost is created as well.

In Naval&#x27;s system, if the premise for participation (eg equal treatment) is equally verifiable by inspection of the protocol and open source code, is there any material difference between the two?  It is true that there is nothing to &quot;stop the network from invalidating the pre-mined amount at will&quot;, but participants will only participate in the network if it is easily verifiable that the network gives effect to the premise for participation.<p>> <i>I just don&#x27;t see how you can</i> add <i>a founder-controlled, for-profit startup to the other players in a crypto currency ecosystem (the miners, the non-profit developer foundation and the coin owners) and get something that works.</i><p>I think I agree with that statement, but only because of the words &quot;<i>founder-controlled</i>&quot;.  If a network like this is to succeed, the founders must forfeit control to the network.  Given that it is the founders who write the protocol, they should be happy to do that, and then set it free.  I don&#x27;t think it would work if the founders made some attempt in the protocol to reserve to themselves a power to intervene in the operation of the network.<p>Can I offer another interesting hypothetical:<p>Is it possible for a network to incorporate some kind of mechanism for democratically amending its own protocol according to some objective characteristic (or subjective vote) of the participants?  If participants are mining &#x27;shares&#x27; in the &#x27;company&#x27;, should they have the power to act as &#x27;shareholders&#x27; and to exercise control accordingly?<p>(Assume that some aspect of the protocol means that the controlling majority is always held by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, which I think is meant to be the case with Bitcoin.)",1394420417

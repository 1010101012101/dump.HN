9890355,comment,9888442,9889498,0,0,lmm,,,"> This is why NASDAQ and other trading venues are exploring the possibility of using Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain to disintermediate the clearing process. The idea is to use asset-tracking protocols (commonly called &quot;colored coins&quot; in Bitcoin land) to associate ownership of an asset with possession of a small, low-value unit of Bitcoin, which then can be transferred in the usual way.<p>How would that help? The reason this was an issue at all is that the legal names on the paper certificate matter because of the way Delaware law is written. We already have a perfectly good way of tracking ownership via computer systems; this post is all about the rare case when that fails. I am genuinely struggling to even imagine how you might think the blockchain could possibly help with this. Do you think the Delaware statutes, which have such a specific notion of ownership that being the beneficial owner of a share held at DTC doesn&#x27;t count, are likely to be worded in a way that makes knowing the secret string of numbers that constitutes a particular private key counts as ownership? That does not seem at all plausible to me.",1436950271

According to the UI guidelines, clicking a button should cause the user to burst into tears of joy due to the delightful experience they have just had.<p>Is it because they need to appear to be producing new things all the time? If so, it&#x27;d also explain why some products get released to much fanfare (and applause from the BBC Technology news team it seems) and then get no updates, maintenance and get binned a few years later. (Many examples of this). The most annoying of these was the Talk replacement for Android (Hangouts) which got rid of features of Talk and still has an abysmal tablet interface and general bugginess (&quot;Did you not get my call???&quot; &quot;No&quot;).<p>I am not meaning to be overly critical, but the constant change for the sake of change is wearying. I have been using Android since the G1 and every i/o they have redesigned the interface. The examples of &quot;bad UI&quot; and &quot;bad text&quot; are all from their own older versions of Android.

While Wikipedia states that it was influenced by the Munsell color system, I don&#x27;t think it was directly derived from it. Also I would argue that it <i>is</i> in common use.<p>On the other hand these measurements measured the local distance between colors (based on distinguishability) but nothing guarantees that the space of perceivable colors is Euclidean in this metric. So you can fabricate an Euclidean space of colors where the Euclidean distance is close to the perception distance, but it may never be perfect.<p>Side note: there is no perceivable color space to &quot;rule them all&quot;, even if you can fabricate a perfect one. For upscaling images it could make sense to use a perception based colorspace for interpolating pixel values, however for downscaling you should use a linear colorspace (note: sRGB is NOT linear, almost all desktop software downscales wrong [2]). It causes kind of a hassle that distinguishing colors of large areas is happening with a strange metric, but if you are looking at objects with fine structure (like your LCD monitor) then the color mixing happens in a linear colorspace.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space</a>

But I was addressing a different point, which was my difficulty in reconciling the author&#x27;s position that &quot;a developer from 1975 could ... feel pretty comfortable&quot; with modern programming languages because the underlying techniques existed already &quot;in some form&quot;, while also implying there would be no developers from 1975 who would feel comfortable with version control control and library ecosystems &quot;in some form.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s surely true that not all programmers now know about closures, just like it&#x27;s unlikely that all programmers in the 1970s knew about them, so this isn&#x27;t a universal claim. Nor did I think it was a universal. Rather, I think the author&#x27;s point is that those with interest and experience in programming languages would have known the topics. That is undeniably true.<p>My response was to point out that those with interest in software engineering techniques would have known about version control systems and library ecosystems &quot;in some form&quot;, because I can point to people who were SCCS, and people who were involved in library ecosystems.<p>&quot;Python isn&#x27;t suitable, or at least is arguable a poor choice, for some tasks.&quot;<p>That inarguable. Java isn&#x27;t suitable for some tasks either. Nor is the statement that the C standard library is smaller than Java. But why is it that Java&#x27;s standard library &quot;really kicked off the trend of wide scale reusability&quot;? What was the size magic threshold? Why did previous languages with a large set of standard libraries (I suggested Object Pascal, eg, from Turbo Pascal 5.5) <i>not</i> kick off that trend?<p>&quot;There also wasn&#x27;t a good way to distribute&quot;<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think you are discussing the same point I am. The author wrote &quot;The magic part is simply that open source licenses like Apache and MIT lower the friction to trying out a new library.&quot;<p>My point was that in the 1970s that magic part wasn&#x27;t relevant. Instead, and I agree with you, the &quot;magic part&quot; for a 1970s developer is <i>instant network access</i>, and not open source licenses.<p>I think licensing is much less magical... and even in the 1970s there was already ARPAnet, email, and UUCP, so again it&#x27;s more a diffusion process than something &quot;magical&quot; or unknown in 1975.",1436948840

You make more than most people, and even more than me and my job is way harder than yours!&quot;<p>Then again, I totally empathize with his alienation from his own job. It&#x27;s hard, spending the precious hours of your short life on things other than what you&#x27;re really passionate about. It sucks that our society rewards being a taxi driver more than creative things -- like this guy&#x27;s amazing writing. I don&#x27;t know what to do about that, and I feel his pain there.",1436947540

The Reddit Gold was flying left and right during the black-out (despite pleas not to give any money to the site), and then every time an admin, CEO, former CEO, or board member pours gas on the fire, their revenue goes up.  It&#x27;s brilliant!  They&#x27;ve figured out how to make money off of hurt feelings and angry people, and now have an incentive to cause as much drama as possible.",1436947353

9890229,comment,9889149,9889149,0,0,diafygi,,,"I have a startup in solar software, and the big thing that I don&#x27;t think people here realize is that 64% of the installed cost of solar in the U.S. is soft costs (i.e. not hardware)[1]. The industry is incredibly inefficient when it comes to customer acquisition, marketing, distribution, project development, permitting, monitoring, analytics. etc. There&#x27;s a huge effort by the DOE[2] and the industry itself[3] to attack soft costs with software and process improvements. The vast majority of innovation in solar over the next decade will be in software.<p>However, strangely, much of the startup community remains uninvolved. Why? The solar industry is expected to grow by 100-200x over the next 30-40 years[4], even when it&#x27;s already a $14 billion dollar industry[5]. And yet, this week in SF, there&#x27;s a huge solar conference[6], and I personally know most of the software companies there (there&#x27;s only a few dozen of us). Why isn&#x27;t more of the startup community coming in an &quot;disrupting&quot; solar software along side us? We just got $100k in free money from the DOE. We closed a seed round in less than 6 weeks. Pretty much every solar software company we know (including us) is hiring. Yet when I go to normal bay area startup events, no one there has any any clue that solar is taking off like a rocket ship and their biggest pain points right now are completely solvable with software.<p>Come join us. In the last few years, the solar industry reached &quot;grid parity&quot;, which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That&#x27;s why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn&#x27;t some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/reducing-non-hardware-costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/reducing-non-hardware-costs</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/soft-costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/soft-costs</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.solarindustrymag.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.13981"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solarindustrymag.com/e107_plugins/content/content...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.pvsolarreport.com/the-next-internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pvsolarreport.com/the-next-internet/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://www.intersolar.us/en/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.intersolar.us/en/home.html</a>",1436947257

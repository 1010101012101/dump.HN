3365656,comment,3365289,3365289,83,0,msutherl,,,"I believe that this sort of sentiment is a symptom of not having answered for yourself the question: ""what makes a good life good"". <i>spking</i> is likely operating on a temporary definition imparted by his upbringing that goes something like this:<p><pre><code>  ""a good life is a life which, when seen from afar, appears to include a string \n   of successful and well-respected achievements, each one better than the last"".\n</code></pre>\nThis perspective is, according to some of my friends from other continents, very ""American"".<p>An alternative definition that is more conducive to well-being <i>and</i> productivity is one in which your subjective experience of life is considered more important than your life as seen and judged from afar (i.e. by others). To build such a definition, you must first analyze and become aware of how most decisions that you make are made with respect to how they are perceived from afar. Once you see this, you must realize that you are simply mistaken in privileging this perspective. How other people (and systems) judge what you do should only be of consequence to you to the extent that it impacts your life concretely. These judgements have no intrinsic meaning. For instance, <i>spking</i>'s post is lamenting a self-inflicted anxiety about how his life appears from an external perspective. He does not mention how his failure concretely impacts his life, only how it impacts his feelings (which are based on his unconsidered and ultimately mislead beliefs).<p>Following the recognition of this, you can then begin to make sense of the question: ""what makes a good life good?"" A good life is not a life that <i>appears</i> good, it is a life that, to you, <i>feels</i> good (i.e., you may remark ""life is good""). So, to answer this question, you can begin by finding out what activities, situations and dispositions lead you to this sort of feeling (i.e. things you enjoy). You can then re-structure your life so as to maximize these things (rather than structuring it around only externally visible achievements).<p>(A quick hint: more than 50% of these things have to do with your past, your friends, your family, significant others, significant locations, food, music, art, etc. You have a career and you do projects in large part to support these things. Taking a vacation and doing psychedelic drugs are two great ways to remind yourself of this.)<p>That said, <i>spking</i>'s projects are failing for a simple reason. What he truly desires is not for his projects to succeed, but to <i>connect with people</i> through his projects. The solution to this problem is to first focus on making a connection as soon as possible. A successful idea is one which takes a life of its own before you get bored of it. In the case of websites, people must begin using your project before you feel the desire to give up. Given this insight, it is best to start with a simple idea that can be deployed in a useful form quickly. Once a platform has been established  ideally with money coming in  more complex projects can be executed within that framework (if you're lucky, with the help of friends and investors)!",1324173381
3365655,comment,3365289,3365545,12,0,andrewflnr,,,"Arguments based on ""most people"" are not compelling to me. To me, the correct standard to measure my performance against is my potential. And I know I fall far short. I feel I should have accomplished more by now, I <i>could</i> have. I know others have.<p>I too feel the call of new ideas all the time, and have the same lack of discipline. I've brought precious few of my ideas to state that could possibly be called ""done"", and none to the glorious state I had imagined. I'm not even talking about making money, just making good stuff for people to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest difference between me and the author is that I'm still only 20 and still in school. To accomplish half the things I want to before I die, I'll have to grow a ton more self-discipline, and sometimes I wonder if I can do it.<p>To tell me and people like me ""relax, other people are lazy too"" is not that helpful. It's true, ""most people"" never fully realize their potential. They have all kinds of bad habits and issues. When have other people's mistakes been an excuse for mine?",1324173370

Most people never create much of anything.  It's easy to focus on ""great art"" that the Internet shoves in front of us and be demoralized.  Our brains just aren't designed for the kind of sensory overload that we experience today, and even the greatest artist would feel belittled by the scope of what is at our fingertips today.<p>But if your goal is to create great art, then first you must dedicate yourself to just creating art.  It doesn't matter if these attempts are abortive, so long as you keep doing it.  Just keep honing your craft.  This is the only hope of ever creating anything great.

It only takes one ""smart cow"" to open the barn door for the rest.  The situation is <i>not</i> symmetric.  The attackers have an overwhelming advantage:  the defense must be <i>perfect</i> while the attackers of a protection scheme need <i>just one flaw</i>.  That's so massively unfair that we have never yet seen it succeed for very long.  And even then, most of the things that weren't cracked were ignored because there were easier ways to get the content.

Not many artists have the resources to bypass this system when they really have the opportunity to opt out of the label system, so the argument of ""pay for it or find another way to get music"" isn't exactly reasonable. And as a better indication, there's been a clear decrease in consumer valuation of individual songs, as evidence of the total effort exerted to bypass current prices, and yet the prices for music have remained steady.<p>I believe that there is a market equilibrium, and that as songs are made cheeper to reflect their new value to consumers, more will buy rather than steal, but it seems like labels are insisting that they should dictate market price without alternative rather than adjust price to demand. I don't mean that they should just lower prices until we get what we want, but I think the direction the music industry is headed is more enforcement of monopoly than prevention of theft.<p>If there were a way for artists to effectively bypass the system, or for value to consumers to have sway in the market price, this may not be an issue, but it is. In reality, the system means more theft, so artists see less revenue, and I'd imagine that artists would go for an alternative as readily as many consumers. And further, if there were some way to do away with it, there'd likely be far less of a culture of theft, or say, less communally supported resources for it, so artists might conceivably be able make money if they attempted to go sans-label.<p>Obviously these are just more reasons why the system is broken, but the difference is the availability of a market solution.

When I graduated from college I spent an evening with friends and we mused what we'd buy with our new paychecks.  I wanted a brand new Mustang and indeed I purchased one.  But one friend, the only computer major, said he wanted a computer.<p>This was pre-pc era and the one he wanted cost as much as a house.  We teased him all night about how speedily he could balance his checkbook or play checkers.  Finally he'd had enough, pounded the table and said with a red face in ten years you will all have a computer that sits on your desk.<p>Our only exposure at that time was to the IBM 360 mainframe the school had and that only made us laugh harder.  Truth is he was right, every last one of us had a pc in ten years.<p>The computer industry moves faster than you think.  A few years later I went to a local store to see one of the first laser printers for sale.  This one was $10,000 and as a group of us looked at it with the proud sales guy. I said as soon as I could get one for under $1500 I'll buy it.  Everyone looked at me like I was crazy and the salesmen said maybe in ten years it will happen.  Actually I got an HP Laserjet in around three years for $1499 and still have it - somewhere.<p>I'd wager that most of us on HN will have a robot in our house in well under ten years.

Look at the webcomic authors:  they give away their work for free, but the smart ones can still make good money.  If you want lessons on how, start watching how Howard Taylor does business.  He gets his fans to ship his books for him and they like it.<p>You can give the pirates the middle finger all you want.

Sites like HN make us feel like everyone is out there creating like crazy and doing all this amazing stuff. The reality is a very small minority of people are doing this.<p>Most people don't create much of anything. At least, anything they could have a major break through on. Most people have day jobs and will always have day jobs. Most people come home from work and watch TV.<p>It takes serious discipline to take an idea through to success. If I had to guess, discipline is a very important trait for startup success. Maybe you'll never be that disciplined, or maybe it's something you can work on. I can say for sure I am much more disciplined now (at the ripe age of 34) than in my 20s. Yet I still question if I have what it takes to truly do a startup.<p>To the OP: I think you should just relax and enjoy yourself, let nature take over. Not every idea has to be worth a million dollars. My current project and the one just before it basically have no chance of ever making me any money. I did them because I enjoyed them. I think that is more important and more likely to lead you in a direction you want to go.",1324170075

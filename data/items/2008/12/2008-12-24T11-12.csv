I played with Io a long time ago, and my first thought was: ""This is lisp/scheme with a different syntax.""<p>Personally, I think embedability, its syntax, and prototype orientation are great. Especially with javascript becoming so pervasive, other prototype-oriented languages are a great addition, especially since js is not traditionally geared towards running outside a browser.<p>If Ioke gets concurrency right and is sufficiently fast (around ruby or python) I think it will be an awesome language. I'm very excited about it.",1230119994

People start babbling about how she thinks that they're always late, or procrastinating, or unreliable and so on.""<p>""What would you say if someone asked you this?""<p>""'You never call.'""<p>Apologies that I don't have a better source for this - anyone recognize it?",1230119106

408706,comment,408420,408629,0,0,ibsulon,,,"Judging by the number of adultery stories I've heard here and there, I'd imagine it's a few more than we'd expect. Females seem to use it for hooking up, not for any sort of relationship, and it seems to be used especially if one is already in a relationship.<p>As for gay men, there are many men who hate the idea of finding a hookup or boyfriend in a bar. Gay.com has tons of users, myself included until I met my boyfriend there about two years ago. While that doesn't affect AFF's population (I haven't heard of gay people using it that much) I would imagine the same is true for straight folk.",1230117451

408703,comment,407796,408248,0,0,cgranade,,,"C# feels dreadfully underdesigned to me. Despite its massive flaws, I still love Java for how consistent it is, and for how well-thought out it is. For instance, generics in C# aren't getting covariance and contravariance until 4.0, which I consider to be a fatal flaw. ""List<? extends String>"" makes so much more sense than ""List<out T> where T : string"".<p>That said, I am sad that the BGGA closures proposal won't make the cut for Java 7. I hope that some IDEs and APIs support it anyway.",1230116743

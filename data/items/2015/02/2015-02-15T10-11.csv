9052311,comment,9050480,9050480,0,0,newgame,,,"Very cool to see my master&#x27;s project here on hn!<p>Let me give you some background information. The idea for 7GUIs was born while I was writing my master&#x27;s thesis <i>Comparison of Object-Oriented and Functional Programming for GUI Development</i>[1]. My advisor and I first agreed to compare Java7/Swing and Clojure/Seesaw. That&#x27;s the reason why you see these implementations in the repository. Over the course of writing the thesis we changed the scope to compare JavaFX in Java and Scala as well as some novel FRP-inspired frameworks and all that with a <i>GUI _programming_ usability benchmark</i> which I named <i>7GUIs</i>. I received great input from my expert reviewers, especially Tomas Mikula[2].<p>Anyway, 7GUIs is work in progress although nowadays I have much less time to work on it (not studying anymore but working). Not all implementations are complete (e.g. Android/Elm) and I&#x27;m sure the existing ones can be improved. So I&#x27;d be very happy if others would help to extend 7GUIs with more implementations or analyses. I still want to try out other approaches myself and compare them with 7GUIs but again time is limited sadly.<p>You can find much more information in the thesis[1] if you&#x27;re interested. I&#x27;ve also written a short overview blog post[3] that deals with <i>Reactive GUI Programming</i>.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.eugenkiss.com/projects/thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eugenkiss.com/projects/thesis.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://tomasmikula.github.io/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomasmikula.github.io/blog/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.eugenkiss.com/b/overview-of-reactive-gui-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eugenkiss.com/b/overview-of-reactive-gui-programm...</a>",1423997569

The parsing and evaluation of text is already written as part of the language.<p>The other point was that we&#x27;re ultimately stuck with serial forms of communication, be it wires, pipes, sockets etc. If we want to easily transfer structured data through these serial channels, we should probably build up our structures from a serial primitives, and S-expressions are much more handy than plain strings (which we may not even be able to parse without ambiguity), or XML, JSON or whatnot. One, because the parser is already implemented as part of the language, and secondly, because you can transfer code in addition to data, and evaluate it on the remote end to bring into scope more &quot;structured&quot; data like records.<p>I did try to include a bit more in the previous post, but I&#x27;d accidentally hit save, and I was unable to edit the post afterwards",1423997459

9052293,comment,9049467,9051067,0,0,mboes,,,"> 3. strictness: arguments abound about whether laziness or strictness is better; for me, it comes down to the fact that with some pain, you can embed laziness in a strict language with effects, but you cannot embed full-on ML-style strictness into a language like Haskell; moreover, strictness-by-default permits safe uses of benign effects.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this claimed before, but I&#x27;m not sure I can subscribe to any sense in which this statement is true. It&#x27;s been known since at least John Reynolds that you can make programs evaluation order oblivious by means of a CPS transformation: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.5892"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110....</a>. Just as thunkification is a program transformation to simulate call-by-name, the call-by-value CPS program transformation is a way to simulate call-by-value.<p>Moreover, Haskell has strictness annotations, so strict programming is possible if you pepper all the arguments of all your functions with strictness annotations and you use only strict datatypes. In fact in the future a language pragma will do this for you: <a href=""https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/StrictPragma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/StrictPragma</a>.

9052258,comment,9049348,9050939,0,0,anon4,,,"At the semantic level it evaluates to an lvalue. Or an lvalue reference. It depends on what the type of t is. Given the syntax, the author obviously meant some vector-like type, so it should, if you&#x27;re following good style, evaluate to a reference. And that&#x27;s what he was getting at - t[0] evaluates to something that can be assigned to. In C++, the thing that t[0] evaluates to handles the assignment (whether t is a pointer and t[0] &quot;handles&quot; the assignment by simple copy to an address, or t is an object and t[0] returns a reference or some object overriding operator= for the type that t contains is irrelevant - it&#x27;s the same semantically), while in Python, the t object itself handles the assignment. Python&#x27;s behaviour is akin to C++ having an operator[]=(size_t, const T&).<p>It all stems from the different behaviour of = in Python and C++ - in Python = binds the name on the left to the value on the right and you can have any number of names for a value; in C++ each name is exactly one value (even in the case of references - the reference itself is a pointer and there&#x27;s no other name that signifies the memory in which that pointer value is stored) and = copies the value from the thing on the right to the thing on the left, in a way determined by the thing on the left (so for references the value is copied to the thing that the reference points to and other types can override operator= to do whatever they like), but the base concept is that = copies a value from one place to another (or moves it if it&#x27;s an xvalue and you&#x27;re using C++11 and what&#x27;s on the left implements move-assignment).<p>P.S. Since C++ lets you do as you like, you can for instance implement operator[](size_t, const T&) as assignment and then t[0, 2] will assign 2 to t[0]. Try putting<p><pre><code>  template <class T>
  void operator[](T* p, size_t i, const T& v) { p[i] = v; }
</code></pre>
in a header file in your next project for fun. Then use t[i, v] for all your array assignments.",1423995858

9440576,comment,9440439,9440439,0,0,patio11,,,"This touches on several of the Big Issues with being a market maker, shopping large orders, and HFT.  Sadly, it&#x27;s exactly as detailed as you&#x27;d expect a Slate article to be.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that it is a bot.  The controller of the bot happens to be, in this instance, <i>directional order flow</i>: unlike the overwhelming majority of market volume, he <i>actually has an edge</i>.<p>The options market maker is, unusually for market makers, forced to transact with any comer.  They&#x27;ve got a license to print money and that is the price of the license.  They get to pick their pricing.<p>In the old days, when people actually talked, parties would be cagey about whether they were buying or selling, to make sure the market maker didn&#x27;t use that against them.  The conversation went like this:<p>&quot;Make me a market [quote a buy price and a sell price] for 100 contracts of May Foo CALLs at $15.&quot;<p>&quot;0.10 by 0.15.&quot;<p>&quot;Buy a hundred.&quot;<p>&quot;Done.&quot;<p>&quot;Make me a market.&quot;<p>&quot;0.10 by 0.15.&quot;<p>&quot;Buy a hundred.&quot;<p>&quot;Done.  #&#x27;(%# you man what&#x27;s your angle.&quot;<p>&quot;Make me a market.&quot;<p>&quot;0.11 by 0.16&quot;<p>&quot;Buy a hundred.&quot;<p>&quot;Done, you mother(#%)0&.  You want WEIGHT?  I hate carrying this.  Next one is 0.20 by 0.25&quot;<p>&quot;Buy a hundred.&quot;<p>&quot;DONE.  You through with me yet?&quot;<p>&quot;Make me a market for 1,000 contracts.&quot;<p>&quot;YOU MOTHER()#%0# #O%&#x27;#(&&#x27;)$#$ ((#) &#x27;%)(#%).  0.30 x 0.35.&quot;<p>&quot;Buying 1,000.&quot;<p>&quot;DONE YOU #%)0#0%).&quot;<p>And the reason the marketmaker just hated that interaction is because they now have what is politely referred to as &quot;inventory risk.&quot;  Market makers by definition don&#x27;t want exposure to the market, they just want to harvest <i>non-directional order flow</i>, where buys and sells roughly cancel each other out, capturing the spread each time and making out like bandits.  (In the case where the market maker&#x27;s second conversation was someone selling the same option rather than buying, they just made $500 for about a minute total of work.  A &quot;seat&quot; on the CBOE, which is the license part of the license-to-make-money, costs millions.  The lucrative ability to collect a little toll from marker participants is why.)<p>But once in a while, you get stuck with inventory risk.  And, if you&#x27;re stuck with inventory risk by being short in grossly out-of-the-money call options close to expiry, the vast majority of the time that&#x27;s great news!  They expire worthless.<p>But they don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> expire worthless.  There&#x27;s literally thousands of contracts which expire every month worthless, and (statistically speaking) a handful which go from being worth pennies in the morning of expiry day to being worth dollars in the afternoon.<p>You probably shouldn&#x27;t feel badly for the options market maker here, except in the general sense that you should feel badly for people who underperform at their jobs.  He&#x27;s suppose to place orders that he&#x27;ll be happy when the fills come in.  (i.e. When his offer to sell a call option is matched with someone who inexplicably wants to buy them at a penny a contract.)  He got the fills.<p>His problem is that a counterparty was smarter than he was and put in buy orders in response to late-breaking information before he could cancel his sell orders.  Which is unfortunate, from his perspective, but avoiding this is <i>literally</i> his only job.<p>This is, incidentally, the whole premise of Flash Boys: people with lots of stock to shop are the guy getting sworn at in the above conversation with a marketmaker.  They would prefer that marketmakers always buy 100k shares from them at a go without experiencing any price slippage.  Market makers do not like this, but can&#x27;t do much about it.  HFTs are much better at making markets than humans are, and are capable of managing the risks of large block trades better.  Some people who preferred getting an exceptionally good deal from human market makers would prefer dealing with them instead of algorithms which can actually, you know, do math many times a second for an entire trading day.",1430023486

9440566,comment,9440236,9440236,0,0,OrdaGarb,,,"I have a slight fascination with sweeteners. About five years ago I imported a kilo of &quot;Neotame&quot; sweetener from a chem factory in Shanghai. It was claimed to be 10,000-12,000 times sweeter than sugar. It&#x27;s a white powder and came in a metal can with a crimped lid and typically plain chemical labeling. Supposedly it is FDA-approved and a distant derivative of aspartame.<p>US customs held it for two weeks before sending it on to Colorado with no explanation. When received, the box was covered in &quot;inspected&quot; tape and they had put the canister in a clear plastic bag. The crimped lid looked like a rottweiler chewed it open and white powder was all over the inside of the bag. I unwisely opened this in my kitchen with no respirator as advised by the MSDS which I read after the fact (I am not a smart man).<p>Despite careful handling of the bag, it is so fine in composition that a small cloud of powder erupted in front of me and a hazy layer of the stuff settled over the kitchen. Eyes burning and some mild choking from inhaling the cloud, I instantly marveled at how unbelievably sweet the air tasted, and it was delicious. For several hours I could still taste it on my lips. The poor customs inspector will have had a lasting memory of that container I&#x27;m pretty sure.<p>Even after a thorough wipe-down, to this day I encounter items in my kitchen with visually imperceptible amounts of residue. After touching it and getting even microscopic quantities of the stuff on a utensil or cup, bowl, plate, whatever, it adds an intense element of sweetness to the food being prepared, sometimes to our delight. I still have more than 900g even after giving away multiple baggies to friends and family (with proper safety precautions).<p>We have been hooked on it since that first encounter. I keep a 100mL bottle of solution in the fridge which is used to fill smaller dropper bottles. I&#x27;ve prepared that 100mL bottle three times over five years, and that works out to about 12g of personal (somewhat heavy) usage for two people in that time. Probably nowhere near the LD50.<p>I carry a tiny 30mL dropper bottle of the solution for sweetening the nasty office coffee and anything else as appropriate. Four drops to a normal cup of coffee. We sweeten home-carbonated beverages, oatmeal, baked goods (it is heat stable), use it in marinades, and countless other applications.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe. The actual quantity used is so incredibly tiny that it seems irrelevant. I&#x27;d sweeten my coffee with polonium-210 if it could be done in Neotame-like quantities. Between this, a salt shaker loaded with MSG and a Darwin fish on my car, I&#x27;m doomed anyway.",1430022994

Importantly, lose my introverted character. Literally went INTP->ENTP (ENTP-A). All the travel stuff, learn languages, cycle-touring, paragliding, caving, exploring, plus try other types of work, start a company, learn a lot of computer stuff, learn a lot of history/culture/geography, etc.<p><i>How did you choose to budget?</i><p>Variously. Some periods pushing red or even red, other periods (after 7+ years) back to the salary-snatch. Had a scholarship for awhile, free accommodation to boot. Initially working wasn&#x27;t necessary, as $50 bought me a month&#x27;s rent in 2001 in China and I left with $15k. Made it through Laos, Thailand and Taiwan on those funds. Later, I tried English teaching but found it wasn&#x27;t for me.<p><i>What moved you to this decision?</i><p>Exposed to travel a little bit at a young age. Bored of the commuter 9-5 lifestyle by age 18 or 19 after only 1.5 years exposure.<p><i>How was the process of finding work again after your travels, if applicable?</i><p>Surprisingly easy. I left Australia having been on a salary of 60k AUD at age 18. 7 or 8 years later I rocked up in London with effectively no western work on my CV for that period (I had actually started a company in China, kept up many interests in programming, etc.). Once I&#x27;d taken a permanent/salaried position (at GBP 40k, which moved to 60k within 3 months) I was surpried to realise that people in &#x27;normal&#x27; career coding positions rarely get the ability to go deep in their learning the same way living cheap in some random country being your own boss lets you. I&#x27;d done diskless systems, clustering, VOIP, digital fax, replicated databases, SMS, lots of mapping, business process automation, and all of that in 6 human languages. I&#x27;d also learned Chinese. Thus, I was in some ways more broadly employable than if I had never spent time away. After two years of salary (one in London, one in LA) I found a remote position, then moved back to China. My wife and I have since had our first child, lived a year in Thailand, and traveled broadly in Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and currently Europe, where we are looking to resettle.<p><i>If you were to do it all again, what would you do differently?</i><p>If I did the entrepreneurial thing for the first time while in a foreign country again (a real learning experience!), I would pay or beg an experienced CEO back in my home country - one with some nous - to give me a strong education in business accounting up front. What&#x27;s critical, what different parties look for, how they evaluate, how to present, how you can usefully evaluate numbers yourself, etc. I would try to meet and involve skilled mentors in my businesses from day one. Other than that, nothing. Maybe buy bitcoins early on ;)",1430022623

It&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s exciting, but it can also get lonely and stressful. In the last few months I&#x27;ve done some awesome stuff (Like going to Mardi Gras, and hiking national parks, and partying with spring-breakers). But, it&#x27;s a mixed bag. A few points:<p>1. Budgeting is key. It&#x27;s easy to tell yourself that you can&#x27;t budget for such variably-priced things as hotels and eating-while-vacationing, but you can. Make a budget, stick to it.<p>2. Get hotel-rooms (or airbnbs) with kitchenettes. Having access to a refrigerator will save you a lot of money and will allow you to eat healthier food. (Because you can go shopping at local grocery stores instead of eating out every meal).<p>3. Keep many income streams. If you do independent contracting (like I do), don&#x27;t just have one client. I prefer to have 3-4 at one time, to even out the late-payments and such.<p>4. Save first, have a big emergency fund. If you&#x27;re a Suze Orman fan, she&#x27;d probably say to have an 8-month emergency fund in place before doing anything like this. If youre a Dave Ramsey fan, he&#x27;d probably say 3-6 months. Either way, you need money for emergencies. Once you have that, the regular up-swings and down-swings of your finances won&#x27;t be so stressful.",1430020880

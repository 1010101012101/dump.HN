Turn off your phone when you're not using it. Yes, it is inconvenient, but trading privacy for convenience means you don't value it very much. People got along fine before EZ-Pass came along.<p>Until we have mandatory legislated tracking devices in cars, etc. (not a far-fetched idea at all, and something that must be fought), you are largely the keeper of your own privacy.",1234771138

The objection that some people have is his moratorium on <i>federal funding</i> of embryonic stem cell research.<p>This is a small part of all bio research that is morally contentious.

Problems include the fact that many people don't turn to google first thing for pizza, that google still doesn't do a good job looking up businesses by name, that even with geo-targeting food delivery is hyper local and very competitive, that even yelp and seamlessweb have interesting penetration in only a tiny handful of cities, etc.  Frankly, I don't really think the internet is the wave of the future for a lot of restaurants -- I'll find out about them from word of mouth or from walking around my neighborhood.

482774,comment,481868,482570,0,0,davidw,,,"Debian is not just slow, but slow and irregular with their releases.  There's nothing that says ""about every 2 years"" or ""let's try for once every 18 months"" or something like that.  It happens when it happens.  That can be kind of maddening.  With Ubuntu you have the choice to either grab on to the every-six-months version, or use the long term support version.<p>The ""just use unstable/experimental"" thing is fine if you have no memory of really big transitions... libc5 -> glibc6, for instance, caused a lot of breakage.  There are no guarantees that that kind of thing won't happen again.  Using unstable is fine if you're a hacker and don't mind helping out when something goes awry - I'm glad people do that, and did it myself at one time.  But if you're not in a position to drop what you're doing to go chase down some obscure bug in a package, then perhaps unstable should be approached with caution.<p>Ubuntu and Debian really aren't that different - file layouts, tools... pretty much everything is the same.  Which is good... it makes Ubuntu Debian + money for usability improvements + a more unified vision + a regular release schedule.<p>Oh, another thing I like with Ubuntu is that I can run exactly the same code on my laptop and server, which has proved to be quite convenient more than once.<p>Debian is fantastic though... if Ubuntu ever falters, I will go back without a second thought.  They get a ton of things right and do great work.",1234767897

At such places success stories abound of sons and daughters of lower middle class workers who cracked some competitive exam or another have landed, and naturally students are inspired to work harder.<p>Go little deeper and in the rural areas, the socio-economic conditions there are such that kids who can attend schools and colleges consider themselves privileged. And these people do uplift the economic situation of the entire family.<p>The point I am trying to drive here is that the parents are generally right to emphasize the importance of education to their children. Of course, obsessive behavior as demonstrated in this article is wrong.<p>The inherent problem which leads to this is two fold: lack of seats and unscientific content in education.<p>Lack of Seats
There is an utter shortage of seats in all educational centers in India. This leads to higher ""cut off"" grades leading to obsessive competition. The very idea that grades are the blanket deciding factor to deem a student fit to attend a certain school is very poor and it needs scrutiny urgently.<p>Unscientific content
The Indian education, in its current form, discourages creativity, emphasizes solely on memorization capabilities (I have some friends who are now managers at Big Four IT companies who memorized essays for English exam and sums for Math exams and got super grades) and is highly politicized. It is geared to train students to be doers and not thinkers, it does not light the burning curiosity that I feel is very important to really learn anything (be it math, sciences, even history, etc)<p>IMHO, there is an need to modernize the educational system which should solve many a problems.<p>It is a mammoth task; grading system, content, creativity, the ""tuition problem"" to name a few obstacles. We can start out by accepting the problems.<p>Again, all due respect to your views. I can relate with them and probably would have completely supported them had I not had the opportunity to visit what some call the ""real India"" :)",1234767694

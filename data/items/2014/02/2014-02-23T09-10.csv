So that if you own 5 accomodations, of which each can house a family, you might be better off with selling the sixth one than holding it, paying exorbitant tax and risking it might stay empty for too long. I would pump money earned from this tax back into basic income.<p>Such tax might be beneficial even now in some places. In Japan and Italy so many properties were bought out by people intending to profit from the rent that price of accomodation rose to the point that most young people can&#x27;t afford to live alone and stay with parents instead.",1393149589

Switzerland is having a national referendum on whether to offer one, and stipends from oil or casino money, while not enough to live on at this point, already exist in a few places. You <i>may</i> be correct that there&#x27;s not enough money to give everyone enough to live on, but it&#x27;s far from sci-fi.<p>(There is plenty of money in the world, it&#x27;s just tied up in things like insane finance industry salaries, or $500k/yr/person for imprisonment, etc.)<p>And historically? People looked after their own menial tasks, where they were small enough, and where the tasks were too big for individuals (like roads, or building a town hall) the community got together and did it.",1393149585

For example financiers which might be categorised as: high compensation, low to moderate effort and low social benefit and janitors: low compensation, moderate effort, low compensation. Now you can start to make value judgements about how different types of work are rated or (should be) valued by the general public or society as a whole. You can also factor out the ideological or moral components attributed to work by various political factions and start to answer interesting questions such how much should teachers be paid and what jobs which are low compensation, low social benefit should we be automating as fast as possible.",1393148379

For business reasons we were not interested in promoting this outside these countries.<p>On Facebook, out of all options, we decided to promote a post, targeted to EU countries, this post included a custom bitly link to our campaign&#x27;s website, etc. A few hours after launching the campaign, we checked on the post: likes/engagement, CTR, bitly link, etc. We were shock to see that almost 90% of all likes to the post and clicks where made from Brazil. Facebook had been promoting our post in Brazil and not (marginally) in the countries we specified – I clicked on a long list of Facebook profiles who had liked our promoted post and these were primarily from the Sao Paulo region. I double checked bitly&#x27;s stats with the our analytics to check who landed on our site via the campaign link. Again, c. 90% from Brazil.<p>The first thing after that finding was to check that the campaign was correctly setup, and it was. We immediately stopped the campaign and reached out to FB via a form (they have no email nor telephone) telling them about the issue, we included screenshots and other relevant information. We never heard from Facebook. We spent around €2,000 on a useless campaign targeted to an audience which wasn&#x27;t our target market. We have never used FB again.",1393148341

In a world in which that is not a reasonable expectation, the dignity of work can be a harmful concept.</i><p>Interesting times ahead. It&#x27;s going to be painful getting there, if we get there at all, but the idea of a Universal Basic Income seems to be getting more popular. (It wasn&#x27;t so long ago it was pretty much pure sci-fi.) Particularly I guess as it begins to look like modern capitalism may not actually be good at providing jobs for everyone who needs one.<p>Potentially UBIs could be very good for the world, freeing people to work on things they personally desire and value, and in some ways redistributing the &#x27;means of production&#x27; back to the little guy.",1393147694

I put off a book report until the last minute and found myself needing to read 5 chapters about medieval Italian republics in 3 hours. I allocated 1 Pomodoro to each chapter, and said that if I hadn&#x27;t finished the chapter before the end, I would skip to the next one. This forced me to speed read and skip confusing parts (instead of re-reading them 10 times). The report wasn&#x27;t one of my best, but I wouldn&#x27;t have finished it at all without the structure I got from Pomodoro.<p>I used the focus booster app for OS X, I highly recommend it: <a href=""http://www.focusboosterapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.focusboosterapp.com/</a>",1393147585

Specifically, ramping up development, hosting, marketing (team and spend), sales, etc. still costs enough money that outside capital helps.<p>This last point is key and answers the question of &quot;why would I raise capital if I did all of the work of building a prototype and getting my initial customers?&quot;.<p>Lastly, the ultimate goal is to succeed. There are a number of different paths to success, but one of the worst failures is not outright failure of a company.<p>If you think about the possible outcomes of a business, there are basically 3:<p>1. Complete failure...business shuts down<p>2. Moderate success...$2 million, $5 million up to maybe $25 million<p>3. Success... $25 million plus with the ultimate goal of doing 9 or 10 figures a year<p>#1 sucks. Maybe more without venture capital as its your money you lost, but it&#x27;s good in no way.<p>#3 is great whether or not you get venture financing. Depending on your financing, you&#x27;ll walk away with $5 million or more personally.<p>#2 can either be a wonderful success, or the worst failure (worse than #1). #2 is great if you bootstrapped. If you bootstrapped, you&#x27;ll walk away with $5 million or more in your pocket. If you grow to $10M+ in revenue, then you&#x27;re financially free.<p>However, #2 sucks if you raised significant capital. Most likely, you hate the company because you&#x27;ll walk away will nothing even though the company has had some success. Investors will hate the company because the investment is sucking up time, focus and will never be a winner.<p>In this light, waiting to raise capital until a company is a little bit more mature is a boon for entrepreneurs. If you have a #1 then kill it and move onto the next opportunity. If you have a #3, then go raise (or don&#x27;t).<p>But, if you have a #2 then you know you can get rich by bootstrapping, which will prevent you from making the mistake of raising capital for a non-venture fundable business.",1393146514

Exploiting buffer overflows is messy, requires a lot of effort, and it&#x27;s detectable. Thus, you are more likely to use it for something special.<p>Apple&#x27;s TLS handshake bug was trivially easy to exploit, entirely silently, in a fully automated fashion and with zero chance of detection and without leaving a trace. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a big deal.<p>If you are in the business of collecting massive amounts of data, this is exactly the type of bug that you would be using. SSL clients leak a large amount of data in the handshake (supported protocol versions, cipher suites, extensions, etc), allowing you to fingerprint them and detect the vulnerable ones on per connection basis. You then attack, safe in knowing that you won&#x27;t be detected.<p>Once you get the victim&#x27;s password (e.g., if you attack their email client), you can suck out all the data you want.

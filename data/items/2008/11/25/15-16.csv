Owners are free to decide here in Austria, and people smoke <i>everywhere</i>.  We have located three places that are smoke-free here in Innsbruck: Ikea, McDonalds, and Burger King.  People who are ordinarily very polite, always stopping at cross-walks and such, think nothing of lighting up in front of a pregnant woman or a baby.<p>I think this is one of the most interesting solutions I've seen to the smoking problem:<p><a href=""http://oxonomics.typepad.com/oxonomics/2008/02/the-economcs-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oxonomics.typepad.com/oxonomics/2008/02/the-economcs-...</a><p>Which would be more likely to create the outcome you cite than either a blanket ban, or no rules at all.",1227628135

But then, I never was much of one for ego-contests. I did however find something worth discussing in the blog post. Let me quote:<p><i>For myself, I’ve been learning to program with a language that doesn’t make me want to cry. I remember doing C++ and Java homework in CS classes in college; I do believe I have post-traumatic Java syndrome. It’s unbelievable even to me that I have dared to get into programming again. But Ruby is making it easy; even fun. I’m happy to code with it, and I’m happy to be enjoying the amenities of the lifestyle it has provided for us.</i><p>These sorts of experiences give me hope for the future of this profession. I firmly believe that the culture of good ol' boys' clubs and bondage-and-discipline programming languages are fettering access to the minds and talents of too many promising individuals. It's a crying shame.",1227628100

376429,comment,376225,376225,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>But who wants to spend time contributing when there’s no money to be made or fame left to be had?</i><p>Yeah, who would?  Open source is not about altruism.  It's about either money or ego.  If there are neither of those to be had, what's the point?<p>However, there is plenty of money and ego left to be had in the Ruby community.  The last few years have been about ""hey, programming can be fun.""  Most of us knew this already, but some people assumed that Java was all there was (thanks to JavaSchools).  The Ruby community, I think, made it OK to use non-Java languages and still be taken seriously.  But with that out of the way, it's time to get serious.  It's time to fix the ruby's memory leaks.  It's time to tighten up the libraries.  People who work on this will get money and fame, trust me.<p>I have been doing Perl for a long time.  Even though I keep hearing that it's a dead language, I know for a fact that there is plenty of fame to go around for library authors and people that work on the core.  So there is no need to leave the Ruby community if you want fame and want to use Ruby.  (And if you don't like Ruby, why not give Perl a try ;)<p>(I should also point out that it took the Perl community almost 10 years to get a really solid implementation that didn't leak memory (it took until 5.10.0).  The Ruby community has a lot of work ahead of them.)",1227627144

376424,comment,376168,376404,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,">  <i>only one branch is going to be the actual product and the other branches are wasted effort.</i><p>Not necessarily.  Where I work, the primary software development happens on embedded telecom hardware, which is then supported for years and years later.  We have many different current and legacy versions of the same codebase that are still in various stages of development, production, sales, and supprot.  On top of that, there are multiple releases of each version for various types of customers.<p>Now granted, we don't use Git (or any sort of modern VCS/DVCS), but the need for branching is very real and does not always stem from whimsical developers.  There are plenty of real-world scenarios where intelligent branching is a huge benefit.<p>Another situation I know of is the Mantis Bug Tracker project that I work on.  We just recently switched from Subversion to Git, and we have three primary branches in our repository for the old-stable, current-stable, and development versions of MantisBT.  We use Git's branching to allow us to work on large changes to the legacy codebase without disrupting the stability of the development branch, and Git allows changes from one branch to be very easily ported to parallel or older branches.<p>""Herding cats"" seems like an indirect substitution for ""I don't like branches so no-one should use them.""",1227626991

We've talked with Perforce Support a fair amount regarding large files, and they remind us that we are abusing their system.  It's like using Harley Davidsons on a worksite to move around loads of dirt.  It may work, but it's not the intended use.<p>We might be able to get that to work for some of the binary files realativly easily.  The problem is that the majority of these files are build artifacts for our test programs and the builds happen in the same directory as the source (yes, this is a stupid way to do things, but we need to do what customers do, and our customers do this).  It would be very hard to distinguish between build sources and build artifacts.  This leaves the issue of branches. Each branch would have to 'know' which of the binaries to grab in the shared space, and update other branches at integration time.<p>This could be a valid way of doing things, but it would take a fair amount of effort because our environment is like the real world; dirty and complicated.  For the past couple of years it's been on the backlog to clean and simplify our environment, but something more important always comes up.",1227625871

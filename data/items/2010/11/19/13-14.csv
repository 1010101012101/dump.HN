One of the projects will eventually be in PHP - but I see no reason why I can't clean the code up a bit, check it in and publish it.<p>It is just a collection of libs for GAE with my own glue code for the app, controller, a templating wrapper and some JS glue to get the models from the server into the client. You define the models and it auto generates scaffolding which you can re-arrange with the JS. Super-easy to create form based apps, I will push it to github next week and post it here on HN (I haven't had this much fun coding in a while, especially with being able to whip up mini-projects from idea to prototype really quickly - for eg. I did a simple todo list in a few hours, and a simple crm in a day (both auth with google), the actual code is just the models, over-riding the controllers where needed and placing form/record elements",1290175169

Feeling pressure from an increasingly sophisticated U.S. and Europe, they wanted to know what it would take to catch up with the Japanese, then widely considered to have the best, most sophisticated manufacturing processes in the world.<p>The consultants came and toured some of the major manufacturing cities and facilities, taking notes, interviewing workers and managers, testing final output and raw materials quality, crunching numbers, analyzing the supply chain, that sort of thing. Finally they met with the Soviet leadership in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), home of some of the major industrial capacity of the Union.<p>After reviewing the findings for several hours, one of the Soviets, impatient with all the details finally spoke up, ""yes yes yes...we know all this...what we want to know is, how long will it take, if we put all of our national resources behind it (meaning, a space race level effort), for us to catch up with the Japanese?""<p>Their reply?<p>""Forever""<p>Their analysis revealed that the systemic and social issues in the Soviet Union (as well as a combination of material resources and other odds and ends) were so bad, that no matter how much effort the Soviets put into upgrading their manufacturing processes, and no matter how long they put that effort forward, the Japanese would always be ahead.<p>The consultants were quickly rushed out of the country and the study was never spoken of again.<p>Within the decade, the Union had fallen and it was all a moot point anyway.",1290174744

1921347,story,,,33,0,MTarver,"Appeal for Shen (successor to Qi II)",,"Shen is a programming language designed to replace Qi II over the next two years.  For those of you not in the know, Qi is a language implemented on top of Common Lisp which uses sequent calculus to provide a level of type security whose scope exceeds that of conventional functional languages. Qi combines this with an environment that gives access to pattern-directed functional programming, compiler-compiler technology and logic programming via Prolog.<p>Qi II is written in Common Lisp, but Shen is intended to run, not just under Common Lisp, but under many platforms including Javascript, Common Lisp, Scheme, and NewLisp amongst others.   Central to this project is the definition of a small, powerful and highly efficient Lisp kernel called K Lambda.  In September 2010, Carl Shapiro and I agreed an instruction set defining  K Lambda and capable of implementing the whole of Shen.  In September of 2010, I successfully ran a executable version of Shen under CLisp using an instruction set of 50 system functions.  This should make Shen much easier to port than Qi II.<p>Shen will appear under a liberal license giving all users power to develop commercial applications.  <i>However funding is becoming a critical issue</i>.<p>Unlike ML, Haskell and Prolog, Qi and Shen are not nurtured through public funding.  Nor do I depend on the largesse of a corporation.  This fact has allowed Qi to develop without institutional or corporate interference, and it has travelled a long way considering the lack of funding.  But we have arrived at a point in the project where I cannot carry Shen financially as I carried Qi for many years.   Without capital it is difficult to carry this project through to a successful conclusion and to keep it going.<p>The figures involved are not large, because there is one person involved, myself, who is driving much of the work.  However, even though I hope to be working with others in developing an open source library and the work of porting has volunteers lined up, still coordinating and mentoring discussion will take a lot of my time.  Hence for the first time I am launching an appeal for people to step forward and pledge a small monthly amount to the project.<p>You can read the details of the work in progress, the potential future and contribute to the appeal here<p>www.lambdassociates.org/Shen/appeal.htm<p>Since this message will be going out to several forums, it may not be possible for me to reply in depth and detail to everybody who posts here.

I will be travelling again in January so will be interesting to see what it's like.<p>Pesonally I love the electronic visa waiver. I no longer have to fill out paper work on the plane.<p>I personally don't care about them having my fingerprint. I'm just one of millions transiting through the Usa everyday and I can't see much is going to be done with it other than sitting on a hard disk somewhere.<p>I see the attitude in the TSA but it doesn't really bother me. They work in an environment which is always busy, full of noise and obviously I am always in international terminals so they have a lot of complex visa and immigration situations to deal with.<p>The immigration line can be seriously annoying. I wish they would have separate lines for people on the visa waiver and also for people on connecting flights. The fact there is no priority for people on tight connections is annoying.<p>I'm not fussed about a full pat down, doesn't bother me.<p>I love coming to the US and don't find the security hassles that big of a deal. I love airports so I love to get to the airport early. After a 10 hour flight, an extra hour is  nothing to get annoyed over and I just stand in the line with a book or magazine to read.<p>People should watch ck louis on flying. Most of us in the west are incredibly privileged compared to lots of other parts of the world and I for one choose to worry about more important things than a quick pat down and immigration check. Flying is enjoyable if you just chill out, relax and have a sense of humour with delays etc",1290172264

You can get play from lots of different things (work/music/improv etc), but it&#x27;s human nature to want to play.<p>Games <i>are</i> a part of culture, just like music is. Music serves no intrinsic utilitarian purpose. You wouldn&#x27;t want to cut a person of culture any less you would want a person to never listen to music.<p>Of course, anything in excess tends to be bad. And some games are engineered in diabolical ways and only live to make money. But games in an of itself are a natural and important part of a normal human beings life. And in this generation, computer games are.",1399795112

For one of two reasons : disappointment in their own abilities or because they just don&#x27;t aspire to anything else.<p>I think you&#x27;ll agree this is undesirable, so how would you prevent it ?<p>2) Look at a few rich kids in college/university who are doing this now. There&#x27;s two problems :<p>a) what they find important is worthless (e.g. nobody will ever design, say, an xbox, or a tesla in a society like this. But we&#x27;ll know a hell of a lot more about theoretical matrix multiplication. No implementations whatsoever, of course)<p>b) the few that do have worthwhile pursuits don&#x27;t get any more funding than the worthless ones (e.g. kiva systems got started as a university project, but they couldn&#x27;t even build a single robot. In a society like the one you&#x27;re describing that would have been it. Yet from this perspective they made inventory management less human-intensive, which from this perspective would be really good)<p>3) what about the jobs that need doing, but nobody wants to do. Garbage collection is the poster-child here, but it&#x27;s not alone. Mining. Sailing cargo ships across oceans. Crew members on ships. Oil drilling. Calling library patrons threatening them into returning books.<p>How and why would these jobs get done ?",1399794822

Just like the ultimate arbiter in a car crash is momentum, not the rules of traffic, if you hit a compiler bug, &quot;fixing&quot; your program is probably much easier than fixing the compilerâ€”even if you&#x27;re in the right!

We don&#x27;t see doctors because we <i>want</i> to see doctors, we see doctors because if we don&#x27;t, we will be maimed or killed by disease or dysfunction.<p>By the time people are seeking a doctor, they&#x27;re often not in any position to evaluate the market--if a real market for medicine even exists where they live--and weigh the reputations or contractual demands of several doctors before choosing one.  They&#x27;re in pain, they&#x27;re suffering, and they need a doctor <i>now</i>.  That&#x27;s very different than buying a watch on Amazon.",1399791967

There are <i>very</i> few things that you can do in Linux that you can&#x27;t in FreeBSD. If you SSH&#x27;d into a FreeBSD system, you might not even notice that it&#x27;s not Linux until you tried to do something system-level like install some software or change your IP address. To your examples, I have used a webcam and printer and played games on FreeBSD.<p>But to that end, FreeBSD still has the whole mess of tools that Linux has (do we really need sed <i>and</i> awk <i>and</i> perl <i>and</i>...). It&#x27;s much more accurate to call FreeBSD &quot;unix&quot; than it is Linux. In fact, this Unix Haters Handbook is dated before widespread popularity of Linux.<p>So while FreeSBD may be better &quot;designed&quot; as a cohesive system than Linux, it&#x27;s still guilty of every single criticism in this article, and is even more likely to be the <i>intended target</i> of that criticism.<p>I know it&#x27;s tempting to say &quot;everything would be better if we all used this thing over there&quot;, but that thing over there that you think solves all of your problems probably doesn&#x27;t exist.",1399791800

There are some interesting limitations to the ibeacon and corebluetooth APIs that we used - corebluetooth can broadcast in the background (but not receive) while ibeacon can receive in the background (but not broadcast).<p>Our goal was to be able to recognize that two shortwave users were within range of each other, even if both phones were locked, so we had to find a way to make these two APIs work together.<p>I&#x27;m working on a blog post that details how we did this. I hadn&#x27;t thought of open-sourcing the code, but people seem interested so I&#x27;m more than happy to do so. I do have to warn you - this was my first foray into objective-c, so I&#x27;m sure there will be some shortcomings :)<p>I&#x27;ll post it to hackernews when I wrap it up.

So the jets are not reducing the mass of the black hole. The amount of material launched in a jet is smaller than the amount of material which falls into the black hole. So black holes with jets would gain mass, rather than losing mass or staying the same mass.",1406487590

8093524,comment,8093051,8093454,1,0,HistoryInAction,,,"There is no legislative change being proposed. Rather, it&#x27;s a regulatory change that YC is requesting.<p>And the change was basically, here are the criteria as they currently stand. If we squint at the language, startup founders can successfully apply for this visa. But it&#x27;s a torturous process, very variable in length of time, plenty of people don&#x27;t apply.<p>Goal: regularize the preparatory process for founders so that it is repeatable and predictable.<p>Process: look at the existing criteria language, which is defined by statute and cannot be changed without passing a law. Suggest reinterpretations of that criteria language such that within existing law, founders whose startups are demonstrating metrics of success understood within our community can use those metrics to also successfully apply for a visa.<p>Right now, there are eight criteria to qualify for the O-1A, of which, an applicant needs to establish three of those criteria qualifications. About half are clearly directly intended for academics, aka &quot;where has your research been published?&quot;<p>One change proposed is that high signal accelerators be seen as prestigious associations, traditionally including late-career honors, e.g. IEEE lifetime achievement. Yet YC has an acceptance rate lower than Harvard (a gameable metric to be sure). It&#x27;s incredibly competitive. Yet completely unknown within DC as such an honor. Or TechStars; or 500Startups. But the predictable question from DC is where to draw that line? And our response should be to figure out how to generalize investor/accelerator signal strength such that DC can use it for establishing visa qualifications.<p>But hopefully to assuage your concerns, no YC acceptance doesn&#x27;t become a singular criterion for getting the visa. Though if accepted, the changes would see YC/500/TS/similar acceptance as one of three criteria needed to qualify for the O-1A.<p>And over time, I would certainly expect AngelList, Mattermark, Disruption, &c... to be valuable for establishing investor signal metrics to complement the &quot;accelerator as educational institute&quot; model that the regulatory proposal alludes to.<p>Finally, keep in mind that the startup visa legislative proposal involved funding levels (lower than YC or most other seed-level funding rounds) and jobs created (usually directly proportional to funding). So investors would still see a conflicts of interest there. It has been something I&#x27;ve grappled with in years of pushing startup visa. Do you have any proposed solutions or improvements over either the legislative model or this proposed regulatory change?<p>I&#x27;ve considered a semi-independent Self Regulating Organization (SRO), like the financial sector has with FINRA. But that&#x27;s so anti-lean, there has never seemed to be much support within the investor community, leaving aside the massive turnover of startups. But theoretically, it&#x27;d be a group that removes YC or similar from the direct equation by recognizing prestigious investors or accelerator programs. You&#x27;d ask for folks like Naval Ravikant (or Kevin Laws) to serve on the board and recuse themselves where they&#x27;re LP&#x27;d or do (significant?) along-side investment (or maybe simply investment at a similar level of startup development, i.e. seed, A, B, &c...).",1406485988

SCOTUS does this all the time.<p>However, such rulings only reverse the legal <i>holdings</i> of those prior rulings (generally meaning the &quot;rules&quot; developed by or applied in those prior rulings).  Generally, the outcomes of the underlying cases are not automatically reversed.  Defendants in criminal cases can usually appeal their  outcomes even if their cases has been finalized (all appeals concluded), but defendants in civil cases usually cannot unless their cases are still proceeding through the court system (i.e., the case is still somewhere in the appeals process).",1406485843

There&#x27;s a proposal to let them go to card-only and not accept cash, but it hasn&#x27;t passed.<p>One of the complications is that the only card some stores accept is Dankort, a Danish debit card system with low merchant fees (especially true of some small bars, coffee kiosks, etc.). So if they stop accepting cash, those places will effectively become limited to Danish residents. Today even if most customers pay with Dankort, a foreigner can always pay in cash.",1406484860

So what is the actual legislative change being proposed?<p>Is the proposal really that YC acceptance becomes a singular criteria for getting the visa?

8093453,comment,8093051,8093391,1,0,HistoryInAction,,,"Yep! But what attracted us to this change was that the prep time those good attorneys required has been highly variable. If you have a lot of old media coverage, it could be a 1 month prep time + 2 weeks DC adjudication. If not, it could be an 8 month prep time + 2 weeks DC adjudication.<p>The goal of expanding the criteria definitions to more broadly mesh up with the lifecycle of successful startups and linking in the investor signal parameter into the review process will be to change that curve to be much more bunched up against the 1 month bins.<p>And yes, part of our argument was that startup founders /are/ doing all of these things already. Just it takes time that kills startups, and startups are also doing a lot of extraneous work (e.g. chasing NYT coverage when more TC or re/code coverage is what&#x27;s needed to get another wave of early adopters or investor interest for that next round&#x27;s buzz) to qualify for the visa when they should instead be focusing on product and traction.",1406484746

YC wants to give founders resources to succeed. One necessary resource to succeed is employees. Given the current tech hiring climate, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if more foreign employees leads to a measurable and significant improvement in their bottom line. I think you will need to make a few too many assumptions to argue that one is definitively better for their bottom line.<p>Perhaps one appeal of this approach, though, is that this effort aligns better with legislator&#x27;s &quot;bottom line&quot; - if you look at their bottom line as job creation.",1406484590

In a manner reminiscent of the Princeton Review, he instead offered to surrender the domain name if McDonald&#x27;s corporation would underwrite some Internet equipment for a grade school. This and other provoking articles caught the corporation&#x27;s attention; they responded not by funding grade school computer access, but by pressuring the InterNIC to revoke Quittner&#x27;s registration of the name. Although the registry had stayed out of previous disputes such as the Adam Curry litigation, sticking tenaciously to its &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; policy, it wavered before this new corporate threat. InterNIC first resisted McDonalds&#x27; demands, then eventually agreed to revoke the registration, then changed its mind again, leaving the registration with Quittner. McDonald&#x27;s ultimately agreed to donate $3,500 to purchase the equipment.&quot;<p>From \n<a href=""http://jolt.richmond.edu/v1i1/burk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jolt.richmond.edu/v1i1/burk.html</a>",1406484482

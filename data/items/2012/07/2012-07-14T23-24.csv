4245663,comment,4244876,4245571,6,0,Alex3917,,,"I appreciate your perspective. To address some of your points:<p>1) ""The simple fact of the matter is that the FDA, like any regulatory agency in a democratic country with a free press, gets pushed from all sides. Sometimes criticism of the FDA takes the form that it is too slow to approve drugs or medical devices that are already approved in other countries. Simultaneously there is criticism that the FDA approves some drugs or medical devices without full information from the companies that make them.""<p>I think these are good points, and I'm aware that drugs lose their FDA approval or get pulled off the market from time to time. This is generally good. My issue is that a lot of drugs that get approved do so on really shoddy science. I've documented this extensively in previous posts, but some of the highlights:<p>- To get approved, you generally only need to show that a drug is safe and effective for one indication for six weeks or so. There generally isn't any requirement to show that drugs are safe or effective for longterm use, even if they are generally marketed and prescribed for longterm use. A good example of this is with various psychiatric drugs, as Robert Whitaker documents in his book Anatomy of an Epidemic.<p>- There have been many, many cases of pharma companies faking their research data, hiding bad results, bribing doctors to prescribe certain drugs, etc. And the most these pharma companies ever get is a slap on the wrist, usually a fine much less than the profits they have made over the years.<p>- There is currently to mechanism is place to get FDA approval for non patentable drugs. The number of non patentable drugs that make it into the marketplace is effectively zero, even though there are many non patentable drugs that are potentially more safe and effective than drugs that can be patented.<p>- Many of the new drugs approved are simply evergreened versions of existing drugs, designed solely to extend the patents of pharma companies. I wouldn't have a problem with this if these drugs were genuinely better, but usually they aren't. The FDA generally goes out of its way to allow drug companies to market their evergreens as being more effective or having less side effects, even if there isn't nearly enough research (or no research at all) to believe that these things are though.<p>- Many of the epistemological assumptions behind the current paradigms of pharmacology are highly dubious. (Again, I have made my case for this many times elsewhere so it would be largely a waste of everyones time for me to go into this again here.)<p>My attitude toward the FDA isn't that it should be abolished. I firmly believe that government regulation is needed, I just think the FDA is doing a really bad job currently.<p>2) ""...medical practice in general is ineffective.""<p>I generally try to be careful not to make statements to that effect, even though I am critical of the medical system in the vast majority of my posts. Basically in order to say that you would need to know:<p>- What percent of the time are doctors able to make a diagnosis? What percentage of the time are patients diagnosed correctly?<p>- What percent of the time do they get the appropriate treatment for their condition?<p>- What percent of the time are patients better off as a result of going through the medical system?<p>If you have better research I'd love to see it, but the best and most current information on this I've been able to find is as follows:<p>""Perhaps the most striking revelation to emerge from this review is the surprisingly small amount of systematic knowledge available on the quality of health care delivered in the United States. Even though health care is a huge industry that affects the lives of most Americans, we have only snapshots of information about particular conditions, types of surgery, and locations of care.<p>The dominant finding of our review is that there are large gaps between the care people should receive and the care they do receive. This is true for all three types of care&mdash;preventive, acute, and chronic&mdash;whether one goes for a check-up, a sore throat, or diabetic care. It is true whether one looks at overuse or underuse. It is true in different types of health care facilities and for different types of health insurance. It is true for all age groups, from children to the elderly. And it is true whether one is looking at the whole country or a single city.""<p>[...]<p>""A simple average of the findings of the preventive care studies shows that about 50 percent of people received recommended care. (None of the studies reported a percentage of people receiving contraindicated preventive care.) An average of 70 percent of patients received recom- mended acute care, and 30 percent received contraindicated acute care. For chronic conditions, 60 percent received recommended care and 20 percent received contraindicated care. These values do not indicate exact levels of quality in the United States, but they do provide a quantitative sense of how much could be done in all areas to identify and eliminate overuse and underuse of care. [...]<p>The United States cannot afford to let this situation continue. A systematic strategy for routine monitoring and reporting on quality, as well as the information systems needed to support such activities, will be essential if we are to preserve the best of the American health care system while striving to improve the efficiency with which high-quality services are provided.""

(I'll send you note now though with some stuff for you to peruse.)<p>3) ""because street drugs that have had no rigorous studies of safety and effectiveness (and are known to put people into hospital emergency rooms from time to time with deadly symptoms) are sometimes championed by you in other posts, while prescription drugs that have been carefully studied in that regarded are doubted in most of your posts.""<p>I think this is a mistaken belief on your behalf. Almost all of the commonly used street drugs have more research on them than all but the most well studied prescription drugs. And all of the most studied drugs in general are the so-called recreational drugs. For example there are over 20,000 studies on marijuana and cannabinoids alone. Similarly, you'd be hard pressed to find any antidepressant with more research done on it than LSD and Psilocybin. There are many books that sum up the scientific research about specific drugs. For example, the book Marijuana Myths, Marijuana Facts has a good summary of marijuana, although it's about ten years out of date. The book Marijuana Is Safer also has a good summary of the research, although it doesn't cover every single point. There is a good podcast with an RN about some specific medical benefits that I often link to, which you can see here: <a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=258</a><p>I actually have some Squidoo pages with extensive collections of research on marijuana and psychedelics, although HN does not let you link to Squidoo pages. (But you can probably find them via Google or through the internal site search engine, and then find the rest via my profile.)<p>I do occasionally advocate illegal drugs for certain specific issues, but more generally I'm an advocate of more sensible drug laws. I generally believe that virtually all drugs should be legal, the government should regulate the purity and quality, and there should be some sort of drivers license type system in order to get certified to use different clases of drugs. (E.g. there would be a certification for psychedelics, a certification for opiates, etc, as well as certification for different delivery methods.) And if you're not certified then you could still use various drugs under a doctors supervision, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis depending on the drug/dose/delivery method.<p>Also, as a general rule of thumb there aren't really any safe or unsafe drugs, just safe and unsafe use patterns. Unfortunately I think the government is larger pushing people away from safer drugs / usage patterns and toward more dangerous practices. The book Marijuana Is Safer makes a good case for this for marijuana, but really marijuana is just one drug in a much larger argument.<p>Hopefully this explains at least a little better about the bigger picture of what I believe and why.",1342309883

I disagree, at least when it comes to me and duckduckgo (which Gabriel founded). Here's why:<p>Three months ago, I started using ddg instead of Google.

Example: ""amazing spiderman rotten"" (I was looking for the rotten tomatoes page for that movie that just came out, entered a typo) gave the right page for google, while the right page is not amongst the 20 top results in ddg.<p>- while ddg says that they don't track me, the still insist in not using direct links in their search results, but indirect results (via duckduckgo.com/l/u?=...).

At least the latter is required before coming up with a new, improved system.</i><p>I guess I didn't express my ""detached outsider"" argument very clearly. I wasn't trying to suggest that outsiders should dictate <i>specific policies</i> of Wikipedia's editorial process. That task should be left to those who actually know the community well. But formulating specific policies is not all there is to policy-making. Policy-making also involves philosophizing about <i>general principles</i>, such as ""What kind of website do we want/need Wikipedia to be?"" This is the area where deletionists and inclusionists seem to disagree the most sharply, and since debates in this area seem to have been in a stalemate for quite a while, this is the area where I think fresh perspectives are needed the most. It is also the area where one can make valuable points without having to have been a Wikipedia contributor for 5+ years.<p>If you interpret pg's suggestion as ""You have plenty of space,"" then of course he's just rehashing the paper vs. toilet paper debate. But IMO the core of his suggestion is ""There is room to do to Wikipedia what Wikipedia did to Britannica,"" i.e. radically more inclusive, more dynamic, more egalitarian, more accessible, etc. This is a matter of general principles and ideals, not specific policies. pg didn't suggest specific policies as an alternative to the current way that deletions are handled. Rather, he invited Wikipedians to step beyond internal politics and think more deeply about what role they want Wikipedia to play in the context of broader social changes. To call his argument ""pathetic"" merely on the basis of the ""You have plenty of space"" interpretation is to see the tree but miss the forest. Sometimes, forests contain dead trees. But that doesn't mean that the forest itself is worthless. To take pg's suggestion as a simple rehashing of old arguments among Wikipedians is to drag him down to the level of myopic nitpicking that much of the debate surrounding deletionism seems to have become of late.<p>The suggestions I made in my original comment do lend themselves too easily to the ""You have plenty of space"" interpretation, and I'm sorry that I couldn't express myself more effectively. I also learned a lot from the replies I got. I can't edit that comment anymore, but if I could, I might remove all those specific arguments and just focus on the maldistribution of burdens of proof. Because that's the kind of philosophical principle that seems to be lacking in all the nitpicking about unverifiable predictions pro and con. If Wikipedians can't bring themselves to stop obsessing about internal politics and reconsider what their philosophical commitments imply, at least I hope they're humble enough to admit that an outsider might have more interesting things to say about matters of general principle. A community that is all too ready to discount outsider perspectives is a sure sign of an ailing community that is trying to insulate its existing power relations even more from rational scrutiny.",1342309161

Large numbers of users are very quick at finding bugs the devs never noticed. Sometimes products just aren't ready to be released - they need more time and money put into them. Private companies have the advantage of being able to push back release dates, or cancelling the project without ever announcing it to the public.<p>A lot of Kickstarter comments are from people who paid X dollars, the release date has passed, and they want their product NOW.

we write a LaTeX markup file and then compile it to PDF.
PDF is basically a paper simulator and lacks many features
which webpages/sites can have.<p>An alternative would be to have a versatile but still constrained markup
language (e.g. an extension of LaTeX, or a constrained org-mode) which
can be compiled or ""exported"" to HTML among other formats.<p>Some of the benefits would include<p>- Folding of text: hiding parts of the document until further details are desired<p>- more sophisticated linking between (parts of) documents<p>- nonlinear/hierarchical document structure<p>- including media such as animation/tutorials<p>- running code in the document<p>The question is: how to approach the development of the <i>system</i>.

many of the features could be implemented, say in jquery or some such,

Actually, at least two things are broken: the software that file sharers use, and the record labels' business model. The current situation can't be the final answer. And what happened with music is now happening with movies. When the dust settles in 20 years, what will this world look like? What components of it could you start building now?<p>The answer may be far afield. The answer for the music industry, for example, is probably to give up insisting on payment for recorded music and focus on licensing and live shows. But what happens to movies? Do they morph into games?""<p>We (= the possible founders of our next adventure) do not necessarily disagree with the above, but we may have another idea: combining a Steam-like market with the music industry. And while this might seem like a pretty standard idea with a few extras, we're convinced that the in-game achievements and the social aspect of Steam have made it popular, and we think it may be possible to do the same for music.<p>We are, of course, not sure about this, and would be happy to hear some opinions.

Digital reception is horrible in my house, cable companies charge about the same for their most basic (usually hidden) package, and I cannot watch it on my iPad.

Hulu Plus is closer to Aereo's competitor, not Netflix. Old episodes of TV shows are available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus. But only Hulu Plus has the new seasons without charging by episode. If I can get new seasons of ABC/CBS/FOX shows to automatically record so I can watch them with my wife (who has a very erratic work schedule), $12/mo is NOTHING.<p>I have no idea what beef the author has with Aereo but I'm certainly rooting for it.

4245595,comment,4244709,4244986,4,0,JamesLeonis,,,"> Dude, it's Instagram. It lets you add faux vintage to your pictures. Building pyramids we are not.<p>This is a false dichotomy. It's like comparing Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" to Jimi Henrix's ""Purple Haze"". Egyptians may have built the pyramids, but they also built thousands of small homes and fields that don't have any value to us today. Jimi's work was likewise born amid a bunch of forgettable pop songs by others that served only to entertain for a short time. Great things are born in a sea of the mediocre. You <i>can't</i> optimize this away. In fact, to do so will do far more harm than good because it stifles and crushes the mind's ability to explore.<p>The goal of geometry wasn't to build the pyramids any more than computer science was to build the Internet. At the time, each solved a business purpose (farms for the former, ballistic calculations for the latter). They were the byproduct of several big minds that wanted to build something else beyond the practical. Ask yourself how pyramids allow me to build a better farm? How does the Internet make ballistic calculations easier?<p>Everything of cultural significance throughout history <i>had little or no practical value at the time</i>. The pyramids were huge mountains of stone, had large and priceless paintings put inside, and filled with golden items. For what? Some dead guy. Leonardo shunned practical architecture, math, and anatomy so he could paint some girl. Bach was genius in patterns and sound, but all he wanted to do was bang on ivory keys. Even science takes a long time to serve a practical purpose. If kings and nobles asked for the practical from Galileo et al., we wouldn't have the telescope or even bothered studying astronomy. [1] Every significant song, play, artwork, architecture, and book serve almost no practical purpose. Do we do away with them because of their apparent lack of practical purpose?<p>Instagram still had to solve problems that aren't directly related to hipster pictures. They had to solve image processing in real time with a small device. They had to solve the problem of updating and messaging tens of thousands of nodes with millions of users. They had to solve network outages, slow connections, and availability at scale. It taught the Instagram team those concepts can be used to solve other problems. Now they have both the technical knowledge and the capital to build something else. Maybe they solve a ""big"" problem or they go off to build some other widget.<p>I hate the obsessive view that everything needs a practical purpose. Why does Instagram et al. teams need to solve any ""big"" problem? When you back up far enough, most services don't solve any big problem at all. Poverty isn't solved by Google's search algorithm. War isn't solved because Paypal made it easier to buy stuff online. Hunger isn't fixed by Amazon's internet shopping. If we measure everything by the metric of solving really hard problems, then almost everything we do every day fails to live up to that metric. Is that really the metric we want to use to measure the usefulness of a business or product?<p>People <i>are</i> working on the hard problems we are facing. They are very passionate about solving them, even just a little bit. Looking at Silicon Valley and saying they aren't solving any real problem is being incredibly insulting to those people who are working on the big problems. It's like saying that ""If only those SV people would look into such and such problem, it would be solved."" No it won't. We aren't Superman. We would only be adding our great minds to the sea of great minds already working on those problems.<p>Family Guy [2] sums up my feelings of whether or not a service/product solves a ""big"" problem. Go out and do something you find interesting. Who knows what it will become or if it will serve a useful purpose.<p>[1]: I understand that Astronomy was used to plan for farming, harvest, and other time keeping purposes, but that was known thousands of years prior to the Middle Age thinkers. What 17th century problem did finding out that points of light in the sky went around other points of light in the sky? Probably a whole lot of nothing. Now that knowledge is very useful, but it took 300+ years to become practical.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3DlIrvoHg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3DlIrvoHg</a>",1342306953

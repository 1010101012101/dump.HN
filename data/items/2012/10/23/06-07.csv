Think of how much money could be going to tax instead of 'criminals' abroad.<p>In the Netherlands, they have started requiring users to register for a weed card, which has been enforced in multiple provinces. Foreigners are no longer able to use coffeeshops. Just Dutch nationals that choose to be registered at a shop. The effects? More dealing on the street. People don't like being registered. Slowly but surely more and more people are registering, and the rest are getting it through their friends, or illegal dealers which is the worst situation.<p>Open it up as much as possible.

Not just saying what the politicians wanted to hear. Not just putting out a statement to placate people and make them feel safe. That is certainly negligent. This is not an attack on science. This is holding authority to account for their negligence.<p>Please post and tell us what the scientists said with authentic appropriate references.",1350973083

There was almost zero barrier to entry for me to get data from their API into a language I knew how to manipulate JSON objects with and muck around to my heart's content.<p>Note to Clever: perhaps go all the way to converting the response body to a JSON object in each language?<p>Edit: also, the ""show/hide, collapse, expand"" buttons are confusing. You only need two buttons that change their action depending on the current state (""collapse"" becomes ""expand"" if the content is collapsed), and ""show/hide"" should be up by the `h2`s.<p>1. <a href=""https://getclever.com/developers/docs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getclever.com/developers/docs</a>",1350973020

IMHO its honestly one of the worst things you can do to yourself in dating even though its extremely common.  The chances of having an emotional connection with anyone is relatively rare and when you whittle down your pool of applicants you can pretty quickly inadvertently eliminate any real possibility of finding someone who fits the list and fits emotionally with you.<p>On top of all the attributes and the potential for an emotional connection that this fictional mate must meet - he also has to find and be willing to reply to a github repository personals ""ad"" - seems like a slim chance but what the hell do I know.",1350972977

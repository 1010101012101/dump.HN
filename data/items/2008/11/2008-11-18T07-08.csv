Actually, google <i>stole</i> it, and got their pants sued off. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing</a><p>note that ""adwords"" isn't just the idea of putting ads next to search, but mainly the auction aspect of it (so google always gets the highest price possible; and advertisers never pay more than needed - the idea is it's a little market), and linking it to search.<p>Overture/goto.com was basically adwords alone (no search results), and was quite profitable I believe.<p>Unfortunately, my little correction doesn't contribute to the topic of the debate... um, departments can certainly be entrepreneurial, also, in some companies, with skunkworks and so on, you are certainly doing <i>all</i> the things an entrepreneur does: funding, new products, marketing. The only difference (and perhaps a key difference, according to fallentimes) is that it ain't their money. Entrepreneurialism certainly has a gut-test component... and maybe that risk/reward of ownership is essential.<p>Otherwise, you're gambling for matchsticks. Using all the same skills, but you ain't gambling.",1226994188

368008,comment,367554,367554,0,0,horia314,,,"one good way to start seeing more objects around you is to try to search for a pattern like this one in your procedural code : a group of functions operating on a certain kind of data structure. A classic example would be the stdio functions in C. You have FILE (which is your data structure) and then fopen,fclose,fscanf etc. which are the functions operating on FILE. This is object orientation at it's most basic (an object is some data and methods to process that data) even if C is not regarded as an OO supporting language.<p>There is only a small step from writing stuff like this :<p>FILE* ofile = fopen(""test.txt"",""w"");
fprintf(ofile,""%s %s %s"",1,2,3);
fclose(ofile)<p>to writing code like this :<p>FILE ofile(""test.txt"",""w"");
ofile.printf(""%s %s %s"",1,2,3);
ofile.close();<p>So. you've grouped some data and some code together so it's easier to work with it. This is just the first step though, but the small objects you make will be very useful. You can make a small library of useful objects that way : file, string, date, time, point, rectangle, socket, regexp etc.<p>Also, you don't have to make the whole program OO. You can keep it procedural (and for most scripts that's the case), but you can use the above objects just like you'd use their procedural counterparts before. Slowly, and with experience both with OOP and larger programs, you'll see other parts of your work that would make sense as an object. On the other hand, some of them won't. And it's perfectly ok - not all problems can be naturally modeled as a system of objects.",1226993867

368004,comment,367212,367898,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Aside from a) the Mac OS to Mac OS X transition (though existing apps worked under ""Classic"" mode), b) some apps during the PPC to Intel transition (namely apps with assembly or endian issues), and c) apps that used private / unpublished APIs, that's not really true.<p>It's true Microsoft goes to extraordinary lengths to keep backwards compatibility. Consider the Joel Spolsky anecdote about SimCity: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a><p>In case you missed that, SimCity had a bug where it used memory it already freed. This worked under DOS for whatever reason, but not under Windows. So the Windows team <i>hardcoded a special case just for SimCity</i>.<p>That is going too far, IMO. Why should my OS have all this extra bloat to check for buggy <i>applications</i>? This is why OS vendors seed preview releases to developers, so they can test their own damn software and issue fixes for these kinds of bugs. While it may have been hard to distribute updates 20 years ago, with the internet it's trivial.",1226993575

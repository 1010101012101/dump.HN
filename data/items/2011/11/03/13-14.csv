And everybody is doing an awful job of it right now (Users and Canonical).<p>""Figuring out what the user wants"" isn't necessarily the answer either.  Not if your goals are as lofty as bringing Linux to the masses.  Un/fortunately, the current user base is NOT necessarily the future.<p>But if they want to bring ""us"" along, there are options.  Drive the design-centric stake into the ground.  Put their designers front and center with blog posts and marketing and workshops.  Make it real.  Let those who want the same-old to make the choice to go elsewhere - cordially.<p>And from there, teach the function-first world from which it comes why design is important, by leading through example.  Open the curtains on this dark basement of a community to let some light in and start a long and important conversation about personal hygiene, kerning fonts and rounded corners.  Help a couple app developers make some real money selling a simple yet well designed app through the new software center.<p>In my mind, that's real communication and leadership.  Bickering over features won't get anyone anywhere, and while their hand-waving ""won't-fix"" is NOT the way to go about it, neither is wasting too much time on people who probably won't like what Ubuntu is trying to become.<p>Personally, I like the new stuff, and I'm looking forward to seeing what's next.",1320328781

A label of ""racist"" has been known to ruin many prominent careers (whether it was deserved or not).

Sending a cease and desist letter to a small restaurant is a cost that would be eliminated if it was possible without risking a much greater cost. Apple is not ignorant about the PR pitfalls either. They are forced to weigh risk vs risk and act accordingly.<p>Instead of coming to premature conclusions that border on delusion, we should ask ourselves what mechanisms exist in the market that forces a multi-billion dollar global conglomerate to go after a small restaurant.<p>Forget the notion that Apple or any company is doing stuff like this out of spite. That is a red herring. The system within which Apple and AppleADay are actors needs to be changed and situations like these are data on what is wrong with it.",1320328130

I'm sure those mentors don't appreciate that sort of attack on their professional accomplishments, and to assume that they're there just for show isdare I say itracist. Consider replacing ""token"" with ""single"" in that sentence if that's not what you mean.<p>He was in this case seemingly implying that if someone writes about how one should take action against racism, but yet hires only a single black man and black woman amongst hundreds, then 1) it does not seem like they're taking action, and 2) the absence of more black people makes it look like other competent black people have likely been excluded from consideration due to race and the two that are there were <i>not excluded</i> because of a perceived need for a token.<p>Note the difference between implying they were included for their race - which would have been a slight on them - and implying they were not excluded despite their race.<p>I don't think this is a slight against the persons in question at all. If I disliked blondes (I'm being cowardly and using that as an example since I am one myself), and wanted to exclude blondes but was worried about public perceptions, I might leave a token blonde or two on my list, but that does not imply I'd pick my token blond at random - I'd pick the best of the bunch. I'd just exclude a bunch of <i>other</i> eligible blondes.<p>Of course it's possible that some racist would just pick their ""token black person"" at random, to compound their stupidity, but calling someone a ""token"" does not imply anything about how you think the selection was done.<p>The only thing that claim says is that Mike believes that it rings hollow to claim to take action yet not have found <i>more</i> black people that were at least as skilled as some of the other white people on the list.<p>My (black) wife regularly complains about the ""token black people"" in various settings, and when she does, it is certainly not to slight them, but to complain about why <i>other competent</i> black people aren't included as well.<p>(I know Mike, though I've never discussed race with him)",1320327400

Take fantastical, it has to check the user's iCal calendar (or iCloud, or whereever that file is these days) persistently. If it can only do that when the user tells it to, it loses a lot of its appeal and functionality.<p>That being said, I think these rules actually make a lot of sense on the balance.

Once consumers forget they can even install their own applications (except through the app store), OS X distribution will be just as heavily moderated by Apple as iOS distribution.<p>Expect Apple, Microsoft, and Google to exert ever more control over distribution.

3191501,comment,3189525,3189525,1,0,cmiles74,,,"The debate over where to place a particular widget or what bits of the user interface are customizable seems off-target to me. What struck me most was the fact that we had a polite community member doing his best to describe a problem that he was very concerned about. He felt that people in the community of Ubuntu users were feeling ignored and he suggested that an easy solution would be to provide more detail on why a particular issue in Launchpad is flagged as ""wontfix"". While the effectiveness of this solution is debatable, Canonical focused on how the community feels selfish and entitled. Ironically, instead of Canonical clearly explaining to this community member why they wouldn't be more descriptive on issues flagged as ""wontfix"", the discussion degraded into just the sort of name calling and posturing that this community member was attempting to alleviate.",1320325378

What happened was that I complained about iTunes on Windows (which I use to put stuff on my iPod Touch), specifically that (1) it sometimes incorrectly marked podcasts as played or as not played, (2) it sometimes hung trying to connect to the iTunes store (for Windows users: if this happens run ipconfig /flushdns in a cmd window and restart iTunes), (3) somethings where hard to find in the UI (I can't remeber my concrete example now, but I did mention it when I complained with my friends), (4) rearranging app icons on the iPod's homescreen is quite buggy: you often windup with empty spots or duplicated icons in iTunes, which then crashes if you try to sync. (I did not complain about startup time, since it doesn't really bother me; and I should also say recent versions of iTunes on Windows don't have some of these problems) My friends said that all of my complaints save for (2) also happened on Macs.",1320325288

I'm sure they do a good job, but just like a lawyer that might charge that rate, high rates don't mean mistakes are never made.<p>I'm pretty sure if I wanted to get a primary contributor to any open source database software to consult on a project, it would be far far less, and they'd know it just as well (if not better) than an Oracle consultant knows Oracle. I'm guessing the majority of these consultants don't touch the core code of the product that often.<p>I guess I still haven't been properly explained the real value of Oracle yet.

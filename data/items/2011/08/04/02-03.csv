I think there is quite a lot to be gained by continuing to teach SICP somewhere early on, even if the degree programs begin to take on a more earthy, practical approach to compsci. There is no reason ""Dive Into Python"" can't be taught in something like ""Modern Software Engineering 101"" and SICP taught in ""Fundamental of Software Design"" or something to that effect. I think there's place for both, and I fully agree with the author that SICP (or a modern equivalent, if one is ever published) is an important formative text in the mind of the novice programmer. SICP is usually one of the most serious interactions a working ""software engineer"" will have with functional programming until his beard grays a bit more and he takes a deeper interest in the craft over the day-to-day ""engineering"".

Back in the mid-20th century, trucking was one of the most heavily unionized industries, via the IBT primarily. However, in the 80s and 90s, various Republican and Democratic administrations collaborated with trucking companies to make war on the unions. Originally truckers were employed directly by the companies, but eventually those companies realized they could react to unionization by outsourcing truckers, either into private shell companies that closed down as soon as unionization hit or by hiring truckers as contractors. Various NLRB boards aided and abetted this regulatory change.</i><p>You are ignoring the other half of the argument here. In Argentina, were I live, truckers are heavily unionised; this is true to the point were the leader of the union (Hugo Moyano) is probably one of the biggest driving forces of the policies in the country. See, since the railroad was torn to pieces by the liberal policies of the nineties, trucks are the only way to transport goods from most of the country. So the trucking union has the power to literally stop the economy if they so wish. This happens almost every year, and sometimes several times a year. It's impossible to legislate against the union (for example, in order to create more trains) without having an enourmous economic baclash.<p>Now, I understand that it sucks to be trucker without a union. But there is a huge economical cost involved in monopolizing the control of any form of transport and communication.",1312426216

It's incorrect to say that every point in a world has voxel data associated with it. Perhaps this is the place where Euclideon and Notch diverge as well.<p>Using a quantized world representation view (where co-ordinates in the world are quantized to voxel boundaries) then as a voxel moves through the world space it moves from point to point in that space. So a 'cloud' of voxels has an origin and an orientation in worldspace, that allows the translation of a local voxel space (the object) into world voxel space. Since you can't do sub-voxel positioning it behooves you to have an oversampling rate between voxel space and display pixels as well.<p>A 'feature' here is that it also allows for fine grain collision detection (harder to do in polygon space) but again its pretty expensive computationally. (boundary surface intersection of the local voxel space with the world voxel space).",1312425665

So, sure, worst case, n times have to do a heap 'sift' which is time proportional to ln(100) as you said.<p>Short answer:  I blew it!<p>But for the exercise, that is, when there are no ties among the n numbers and all permutations are equally probable, for 100 < m < n, the probability that number m is among the 100 largest so far and, thus, causes a heap 'sift', seems to be 100/m.  So, the expected work on number m is proportional to just (m - 100)/m + ln(100) (100/m), first cut, wild guess, don't hold me to it!  So, sum this on m and get the expected work (computational time complexity) up to a constant of proportionality.  Maybe!  That is, so far, first cut, the exercise looks simple!

Bugs: best approached with proper programming style like invariants and defensive programming, along with testing. The quality of software that people actually use can be measured from feedback, bug fix rates, etc. A bigger issue with bugs is usually economics; it's frequently more important to get things into people's hands quickly and cheaply than it is to have higher quality and compromise the other two. Bloat and sluggishness have two cures: measurement and big-O. I'd put both in engineering rather than maths.

And the reverse mapping of mathematics to programming isn't terribly strong either; most general-purpose programming isn't abstract enough to get big gains from maths.<p>As a practical matter, I work professionally on compilers - i.e. far closer to the CS end than the glue code end of things - and outside of the usual bits of parsers and grammars and graph theory, I would still submit the only really important piece of CS maths a self-motivated student programmer needs is the analysis of algorithm complexity; big-O notation for space and time, in other words.<p>All that said, I'd prefer by far students being taught from SICP or CTM[1] than any book targeted at introducing people to a programming language, rather than using a programming language to introduce people to CS concepts.

It's no coincidence that muggings tend to happen in big cities where the chances of a mugger attacking someone they know is very low (anonymity).<p>2) Sexual predator - If a priest rapes a child and the child tells people about it (i.e. removing some of the priest's anonymity regarding his actions) the priest is likely to be investigated and thrown in jail. If you know a sexual predator lives next to the school your kid goes to (i.e. he has lost some of his anonymity) you might take additional protective measures that could prevent your children from being assaulted. Whether this is the most common scenario, or whether it is fair for sexual predators to be publicly identified, are completely separate issues.

All the anti-censorship tools would work just as well against western governments and websites as they do against the middle east and asia. Wifi is ubiquitous and very hard to manage. People's identities are trivial to steal and would be a cinch to use if no money was changing hands. Hacking the client, password reuse, selling dead accounts, proxies and vpns from locations that don't require name use, off shore hosting.<p>Sure, many people wouldn't bother and just adapt. But clearly groups like Anon, 4chan, most of irc, #antisec and numerous others would avoid it all and go elsewhere. It's often repeated that the kids will hang around until something new is cooler. I imagine AnonymouSabu could do a pretty good job of jump starting a new social network all by himself if he got banned from twitter. Even if you have nothing to hide you'd probably head there if your friends are there.<p>Second is how practical PKI with identity management is on a nation scale. To make a serious run at 100% real identity all the time you probably need to go full public/private key, smartcard+pin, IP packet tagging for egress outside the nation's great firewall and so on. With less than all that it'd simply be too easy to avoid.The problem is, PKI with identity management is a really hard problem to do well. One of the largest PKI deployments in the world is the DOD. They wrangled for years on deployment, already have strict security protocols and a managed environment. None the less they had to shut the entire system down not that long ago and revalidate every identity because they had so many bad cards in active use.<p>Sure, the government probably isn't the best at that, hence why the Obama ID plan looks to open standards and a federated group of ID providers - presumably firms like Google, Facebook, Bank of America, Verisign and Verizon. The problem is that many of these firms are ill equipped to manage something you depend on for all aspects of your life, day in day out.

Furthermore, the temporary profits, if any, would only be temporary and would be a greater cost to their corporate image.",1312423284

(1) How to teach a firm foundation for those likely to pursue computer science, and (2) how to motivate and teach a breadth of material to those students who likely will not take more computer science courses.<p>At a place like Stanford, a majority of undergraduates will have taken an introductory computer science course by the time they graduate, but it's obviously not true that a majority will be computer science majors. And while I appreciate SICP and Scheme and functional programming, and completely understand why that kind of thinking should be valued, it may not be the best way to present a breadth of introductory programming knowledge that will motivate, interest, and offer practical examples. Sure, lambdas are awesome, but when you are just starting out in your first programming course, the deep theory behind why lambdas are so interesting will almost certainly be lost on the students. It's like building up a field of math from, say axiomatic set theory or algebra. By the time you get to multiplication and fields (perhaps akin to variables or for loops in programming), you gain a very deep understanding and appreciation for the topic that can only be gained by this bottom-up problem based approach, but then again, a non-mathematician (or non-computer scientist) could have probably just assume the existence of multiplication or loops for the sake of solving higher-level problems.",1312423246

There were 400+ apps to the most recent YC program...I don't want to know if you were one of them.  It's relatively interesting when a company is a YC company, but is distinctly uninteresting that you took 20 minutes out of your day to fill out the application.  That just tells us you had 20 minutes to spare.",1188243624

47110,comment,47078,47092,0,0,brlewis,,,"Where is the abuse in seeking attention by using a <i>truthful</i>  description?  I think making a title that catches the attention of news.yc readers is only abuse if it does not truthfully describe the link it points to.<p>If there is some other reason why you don't like ""YC reject"" in titles (unhealthy us vs them mentality?), why not comment on the submitted article asking the submitter to edit the title?  I'm not affiliated with knewjax, but it looks to me from his comments that he would be happy to comply.  I think most, if not all, previously-rejected applicants who post here would do the same.",1188242104

47107,comment,47078,47078,0,0,cperciva,,,"Labelling a company as having been rejected by YC is misleading, because it implies a value judgement which wasn't made.  Probably 90% of the people who visit your website leave without signing up; equally, my understanding is that most startups (even successful ones) find that 90% of angels and VCs turn them down.  Do you label yourself with the names of all the potential users who ""rejected"" you?<p>As Paul has pointed out in the past, there are many reasons why a company might not receive funding, and most of them have nothing to do with the merits of the company itself.  Being not accepted by YC doesn't mean that they necessarily think there's anything wrong with you -- in this case, ""not accepted"" is not a synonym for ""rejected"".",1188241403

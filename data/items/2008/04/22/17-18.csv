170771,comment,170643,170643,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I don't understand the argument that ""less investment means only the better companies will get funded."" At best, you would have to say ""less investment means only the better companies [according to VC's] will get funded"". VC's are probably better at picking companies than disgruntled entrepreneurs admit, but all of them clearly fund more failures that successes.<p>But I think the most likely result is that ""less investment  means that only the <i>safer bets</i> will get funded.""  If there is a general economic downturn and fewer opportunities for a big exit (from either buyout or IPO), than I would think that VC's would get more conservative.<p>The other key indicator will be the health of the online ad market; if it collapses than you can expect the entire VC/startup ecosystem to collapse.  This is why Google's earnings last week were such good news. But even if a downturn in the ad market does happen, maybe that won't be such a bad thing - then <i>everyone</i> would have to listen to DHH!",1208886974

I live in SF, and I know a lot of programmers (and other tech workers) who live in SF, but I doubt that more than a third of them actually work in SF proper.  Most of us engage in long and soul destroying drives to sterile office buildings in the midst of pedestrian-unfriendly parking lots on the peninsula and in the south bay.  And we pay <i>a lot</i> for the privilege.<p>I think that other cities, like Portland, Seattle, Austin in the US (and maybe Barcelona, Copenhagen internationally) might actually be better places to work.<p>I wouldn't leave SF, but I grew up here and have family around.

170756,comment,170572,170572,0,0,johnm,,,"There are two kinds of companies:<p>The first defines themselves in terms of their (perceived) competition. A great example of this has been Sun. McNealy spouted out incessantly against Microsoft even though Sun's actual primary competitors were IBM and HP (while the true threat was the systemic commodification brought on by PCs and F/OSS).<p>The second defines themselves by the value that they actually deliver to their customers.  Craigslist is a poster child for this in the online space.<p>In terms of the market perception, you should think a bit about who's going to be perceived as the driver/leader of your market and who's going to be perceived as the ""me too"" player.<p>In terms of market validation, it's almost always a good thing that you have some competition.  For Krugle, we nominally have a fair number of competitors on the surface (including Google) but our actual product blows them away.<p>In terms of war chests (money), that's an open question. It depends on how creative you can be, how stupid (or not) they are because they have money, whether or not they can actually use the money to their advantage, etc.",1208885868

What if in 3-4 years the economy is still not fully recovered, and your company is running out of cash?\nWhat if you want to exit? \nA lot of companies that cashed out around 2002-2003 were undervalued, because such was the sentiment right then.

It is simply a great City to live in with the added benefit that almost any escape to the natural world, like skiiing, sailing, etc etc, is immediately available.   The downside is some added cost, but the costs here are comparable to Southbay locations and other major Cities.

To me it seems like the data that one enters into their profile in Facebook is much more organized and uniformly formatted than the train wreck that comprises most Myspace pages. Facebook also one-ups Myspace by making users prove that certain data is true, for example using email confirmations to verify which school they go to.<p>The bottom line, though, is that none of us know exactly how much data is being aggregated by Facebook (ie. are they tracking things such as profile trends by logging changes in each user's likes/dislikes section?). Just like Peter Norvig explained at SS, the real value doesn't lie in the code, or in this case the application itself, but in the amount/value of data collected. The trick is just finding the right way to manipulate that data to yield the highest value/most profitable data for their investors.

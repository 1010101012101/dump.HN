Not because the incident is ""not a big deal"" or that it's isolated, but because it's the type of incident that nearly everyone can agree is beyond the pale and should never be tolerated by society.<p>Even sexists.<p>I think the more prevalent problem is the underlying sexism, the institutional bias, the reluctance to speak up, the fear of being judged ""the token"" -- the fact that a man can think it's appropriate to put his hand on a woman's knee unsolicited is just a blatant, ugly manifestation of the underlying sexism.<p>I know this post had a little more nuance, but it's hard to come away from it without the impression of: ""Women aren't on speaker panels because they're afraid of getting molested"". Maybe that's the case (and if so, we as a society have <i>serious</i> issues)...but there's at least an equal problem of women just not being considered or being searched for. And as that problem persists, then women continue to become such a minority at these conferences that the aforementioned creep feels perfectly comfortable with invading a woman's personal space.",1361815196

I've used many examples of open source software. There are times and places where it's the best thing. There are areas where there is too little incentive for commercial companies. There are also times when you want ultimate freedom to do what you want. There are also times when you want to pay for a level of polish and know things just work. There are also times when you want to be the one doing the polishing and get paid for your work.<p><i>> Meanwhile, it costs money over on Mac OS.

5280348,comment,5279307,5280040,13,0,schoper,,,"I'm not too impressed by Stephan Guyenet's article. He is wrong about one of his main points that fat is completely regulated by the brain and that insulin does not cause fat gain. You can Google for photographs of people who have done insulin injections in a single place over many years (rather than moving the injection point around) and see huge fat deposits at the injection site. That has got to be tissue regulation. Further, lipodystrophy is hard to explain by only invoking brain regulation.<p>We know that artificial insulin is a great way to gain weight. But is that only for diabetics? Hardly. It works just as well on athletes. Stop by your local gym and ask any of the chemically-assisted bodybuilders there for details. Insulin injections are a very common way to put on weight while bulking.<p>The idea that the body is ""confused"" by food density, which seems to underlie many of your ideas, is simply unsupported. The brain is very good at measuring calorie intake irrespective of density. I could point you to rat studies to confirm this, but I'd rather propose the following experiment that you can try in your own kitchen: Try making cream of cauliflower soup tonight, one with skim milk and the other with heavy cream. Measure how many spoonfuls of each that you can eat before getting full. Your brain does <i>not</i> get fooled by food density.",1361814960

2) Chronic disease management is important, but really challenging. People don't really spend their days thinking about their illness. They don't look forward to having their blood sugar assessed. Any kind of disease management program is going to require that the patient be minimally engaged, yet data still effectively collected and assessed.

Or worse, that experts tell them, ""I use Google all the time, you should, too.""  But Google is worse than nothing if the beginner finds code, copies it blindly into their project, and shuffles characters around until it does what they want.

It depends on the makeup of the trainee. The body doesn't work like that (first muscle, than fat) for most people. It's a constant flux in and out of the cells and the overall trend over weeks and months matters for your body composition.
 For that reason muscle gain (as a more advanced trainee) tends to require some with fat gain if you want progress at any decent speed (Leangainers often don't).
Why wait for a couple hours btw? There is no magical switch flipped, which prevents fat gain after waiting a bit longer.

That is not the case for all applications, not by a longshot.  For example, I had to build a DDR memory controller from scratch in order to squeeze the last clock cycle of performance out of the device.  Off the shelf cores are often very --very-- general purpose, badly written and poorly documented.  The same can be true of real time image processing constructs where something like a hand-coded polyphase FIR filter can easily run twice as fast as plug-and-play modules floating about.<p>Then there's the element of surprise.  If, for example, I was developing an FPGA-based board for a drone or a medical device, I would, more than likely, require that 100% of the design be done in house (or crazy extensive testing be done to outside modules).<p>Anyone in software has had the experience of using some open-source module to save time only to end-up paying for it dearly when something doesn't work correctly and help isn't forthcoming.  If the software you are working on is for a life support device it is very likely that taking this approach is actually prohibited, and for good reason.<p>While I fully understand your point of view, this is one that reduces software and hardware development to simply wiring together a bunch of includes.

There's nothing difficult about it at all, particularly when compared to the old days of wire-wrapping prototypes out of discrete chips.  Sure, there can be a bit of tedium and repetition here and there.  At the same time, one person can be fully responsible for a ten million logic element design...which was impossible just a couple of decades ago.<p>If you don't understand logic circuits, FPGA's are voodoo. Guess what? A carburetor is voodoo too if you don't understand it.<p>Let's invert the roles: Ask a seasoned FPGA engineer without (or with superficial) web coding experience to code a website --server and client side-- using JS, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Zend and MySQL.

  Guys, this is not a dick-sucking contest.
  
  If you want to parse PE binaries, go right ahead.
  
  If Red Hat wants to deep-throat Microsoft, that's *your* issue.  That
  has nothing what-so-ever to do with the kernel I maintain. It's
  trivial for you guys to have a signing machine that parses the PE
  binary, verifies the signatures, and signs the resulting keys with
  your own key. You already wrote the code, for chissake, it's in that
  f*cking pull request.
  
  Why should *I* care? Why should the kernel care about some idiotic ""we
  only sign PE binaries"" stupidity? We support X.509, which is the
  standard for signing.
  
  Do this in user land on a trusted machine. There is zero excuse for
  doing it in the kernel.

I'm quoting this sibling comment here for readability by those who do not enable showdead, as it is relevant to the FPGA discussion.<p><i>DrDreams 29 minutes ago | link [dead]<p>Speaking as an embedded developer, I see a number of other embedded devs hobbying around with FPGAs. However, I very rarely see convincing use cases for FGPAs. This article seems to lean toward the belief many of my colleagues have, that FPGAs are right around the corner in terms of general usefulness. However, I disagree strongly. I find that they are highly-specialized devices.<p>Before reading the rest of my writing, consider that at this time, brilliant hardware designers are putting similar amounts of work into both general purpose CPUs and into FPGAs. However, CPUS are comprised of dense blocks of special-purpose silicon for common purposes, such as floating-point math. FPGAs always have to match that dense silicon through configurable silicon, which is less dense. Furthermore, the routing in CPUs is a known entity at manufacturing time. On FPGAs, the routing is highly variable and must be re-negotiated at nearly every compile cycle. That's a huge time sink, both in terms of build time and in predicting performance. Especially since those short routes that you get at the beginning of a project, typically end up being longer by the end of it. Nowadays, we are seeing more FPGAs with dedicated, pre-made hardware blocks inside of them, such as FPUs and even CPU cores. These have more of a chance of catching on for general purpose computing. Notice however, that on these devices, it's the general-purpose CPU dominating, leaving the FPGA as a configurable peripheral, subordinate to the dense, pre-designed silicon.<p>Although one may be able to match GPU performance with an FPGA, it's usually just not worth it. It will take dozens of hours of FPGA coding and simulation. Compiling and fitting and the rest of the FPGA dev chain is very time-consuming and resource-intensive, compared to the speed and elegance of gcc. Speaking of standard development practices, FPGA code is not nearly as portable as C. It often has special optimizations done for the sake of the device implemented. <a href=""http://opencores.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencores.org</a> has a number of more generic modules available, but still, FPGA code does not scale as well as C code. There are add-on packages that help write FPGA synthesis code - code synthesizers, but they make matters especially complicated. The syntax of Verilog and VHDL is not well-designed for scaling. Speaking of these languages, if you are used to languages written to be parsed easily, such as lisp, python, or even C and Java to some extent, you will be very appalled at the structure of Verilog and VHDL. There are many redundant entities, lots of excess verbiage and all kinds of special cases. It really has evolved very little since the days of the Programmed Array of Logic (PAL).<p>Another problem with FPGAs is the additional hardware on board needed to configure them. It's one more component or interface that is not needed when using CPUs. It's an additional software image to maintain, revision, store in source control, etc. FPGAs also often require more power supplies and better power supply conditioning than a regular CPU and often a separate clock crystal. They are high-maintenance.<p>FPGAs do shine though in a few specific instances: 1. When there is a particular, uncommon high-speed bus protocol you need to communicate with and can not buy pre-designed silicon for. This does not mean, e.g. USB. It means something like a non-standard digital camera interface or embedded graphic display. 2. Software Radio. 3. Obscure, but computationally-intensive algorithms like Bitcoin.<p>I hope my words have convinced some people to cool their lust for FPGAs, because I feel they're a bit of a dead-end or distraction for many who are attracted to the idea of ""executing their algorithm extremely fast"" or ""becoming a chip designer."" I have seen many students and professionals burn up hours and hours of their time getting something to run on an FPGA which could just as easily have been CPU-based. For example, one student implemented a large number of PWM oscillators on an FPGA where it would have been much simpler to use the debugged, verified, PWM peripherals on microcontrollers. Another guy I work with is intent on running CPU cores on FPGAs. This is an especially perverse use of the FPGA. Unless you've got some subset of the CPU which adds incredible value to the process, you're exchanging the the density of the VLSI/ASIC version of the chip for the flexible, less dense version on FPGA. This may be useful in rare situations, such as adding an out-of-order address generator to an existing core for speeding up an FFT, but it suffers an incredible performance and developer time hit to get to this point.</i>",1361813350

5280158,comment,5279307,5279860,7,0,glenstein,,,"Same here. I read this whole article a few days ago, and discussed it with friends. The main takeaway for me is the incredible complexity and subtlety that goes into researching the ""perfect"" junk food.<p>In particular, the term ""bliss point"" which seems to apply to a number of properties that food can have. For one example, a ""bliss point"" as applied to the ""crunch"" a food should have, ie the most satisfying amount of resistance for a cracker or chip to have is apparently 4 lbs of pressure.<p>But often there isn't just one single answer- sometimes there are multiple mutually exclusive, highly optimal combinations of preferences, as with spaghetti where you have plain, spicy and chunky. And sometimes, the most satisfying flavor preference is not the most optimal result for profitability- snacks with too strong a flavor will ""oversaturate"" the brain and you will not have a strong desire to keep eating them after a few samples. In these cases it's better to have a subtle taste that never leaves the consumer feeling <i>quite</i> fully satisfied.<p>So yeah. It's not really about ""fat makes you fat"" -- though perhaps there is an aside to that effect -- it's more about corporate junk food researchers foraging their way through a world of data on consumer preferences and designing the most efficient products.",1361813267

Right now it's disconnected. I go in to have something done, the doctor bills my insurance company, and I really don't know (or care) how much it costs, unless I happen to look at the insurance paperwork. The same goes for pharmaceuticals. Which pharmacy in your town has the lowest price on that antibiotic that was just prescribed for your son's ear infection? Who cares, right? It's a $15 co-pay no matter where you go, so you go wherever is most convenient.<p>One solution that's been proposed is the increased use of HSAs + high deductible policies. That way people are paying their expenses out of pocket (for the day-to-day things at least), and are therefore more likely to shop around.<p>I'm not hear to argue the merits of that, but it definitely seems like an approach that might work. I fail to see how anything that takes control out of the hand of the individual will fix this problem (short of regulating the prices, which I wouldn't be a fan of).",1361813192

I take that to be that the judge committed a classic fallacy: he took a frequentist, limit-in-the-long-run subjective judgement, and tried to apply it to a situation where it's really not applicable.

It's pretty trivial to consume a caloric surplus eating lots of fatty foods.  In that sense: fat makes us fat and it's silly to try denying it.

Obesity is a complex state and there are no simple answers.  A diet that may be best for weight loss in one individual may not be the same diet that is best for another.  This seems particularly likely if one of the two individuals is not obese.<p><i>The problem with ""low-fat"" processed food in particular is that the fat is often replaced with sugar to add taste, but sugars and other high-carb grains are more problematic than fat consumption. </i><p>They aren't more problematic.

    2.  *Vanishing* caloric density-- foods that prevent satiation.
    3.  Addictive flavors and sensations that cause cravings.
</code></pre>
Calorie surplus makes you gain weight, and unless you're building muscle it's going to be fat.  All Ludwig's experiments suggest (as reported by Taubes, with lazy citation[1]) is that obese people who have just lost 10-15% of their weight tend to have a higher daily metabolism without conscious addition of physical exercise on a low-carb diet, compared to a low-fat diet or a low-GI diet.  This in turn suggests it might be easier to maintain calorie balance on a low-carb diet than a low-fat diet (for formerly obese people who have just dieted to lose 10-15% of their body weight).<p>postcript:<p>I would also add that lifestyle changes are a factor as well as diet.

5280034,comment,5278585,5279077,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Let's say a murder conviction is based on 37 different security recordings clearly showing the defendant murdering the victim. The recordings make it a certainty that the defendant is guilty.<p>This is the problem with this approach. Let's say the guilty party is someone who looks like the defendant. Now it doesn't matter how many security cameras there are, they all record what happened: Someone who looks like the defendant commits a murder on camera. The number of recordings doesn't inherently show whether it was the defendant or a double.<p>Or let's suppose that the evidence has been fabricated by someone trying to frame the defendant. Someone who fabricates one recording to the satisfaction of the jury can generally fabricate 37.<p>Or perhaps it was the defendant on the video but it wasn't a murder, it was a staged public death in cooperation with the alleged victim who subsequently went into hiding.<p>All of these things are individually relatively unlikely, but they don't become any more unlikely as a result of additional recordings.<p>This is one of the reasons why conviction rates are generally so high. Suppose (picking a number out of a hat, since we can't really know) that 60% of the accused who go to trial are actually guilty as a factual matter. But of the ones who aren't guilty, 0.6% are because a double committed the crime, 0.5% are cases where the defendant is being framed by a third party or the police, 0.7% are cases where the defendant could show a lack of guilt but doing so would endanger someone else and the defendant prefers to risk prison over endangering that person, etc., and when you add up all the individually low probabilities it turns out that at least one of them has happened in a quite substantial percentage of cases.<p>The trouble is that the defendant who goes to trial and claims to have been framed is not believed, because only  0.5% of cases are genuine instances of framed defendants (and juries intuitively understand that), and the prosecutor is too often allowed to infer from this that the remaining 99.5% of defendants are actually guilty, rather than that some quite large percentage of them are not guilty but for some other reasons, each of which seems about equally unlikely in any given case and is thus subject to the same misleading inference. But the alternative, to rigorously consider each of the individually not very likely alternatives, is extraordinarily expensive -- which is why statistics is given the short shrift.<p>At the end of the day the problem is that proving guilt to a level of certainty that would satisfy us if we were being rigorous about it would also cost too much and be too difficult for prosecutors to prove in most cases to satisfy our political desire to incarcerate ""bad people"" on a mass scale without breaking the bank any more than we already do. Rigorous, large scale, feasible budget. Pick two.",1361812227

Saint Augustine remarked how taken aback he was by someone who read 'silently.' The propensity seems to have been that all reading didn't just involve subvocalization it was actually vocalized. I'm not sure that this proves much in terms of whether subvocalization is always involved. This simply may be a result of people learning to read much later (if at all)before the modern age and have decode the words into a vocalized step to aid comprehension.<p>I'm not sure I follow your claim that ""all writing systems...are systems for writing out speech."" I agree that ""most written characters are based on the SOUND of spoken morphemes"" but this isn't by itself proof of how written language is processed by the brain. Certainly ideographic cuneiform counts as writing just as much as modern english. As writing grew more complex we can see a shift in every culture that started out with ideographic representation to move to a system much more dependent on morphemes. But in every case, the shift is gradual and subsumes elements of the purely ideographic writing, proving that the early ideographic writing was seen as just as much a language as the newer script that includes phonetic elements. We do after all, use a language defined by phonetic features.",1361812088

For example if you find it valid to say ""when he tosses that coin, it has 50% probability to land on heads and a 50% probability to land on tails"", then you should also find it valid to say ""he tossed that coin, and it now has a 50% probability to be on heads and 50% probability to be on tails"" if you did not yet see the coin. That's because in both cases, the outcome was already determined (by the laws of physics, disregarding quantum mechanics). The thing is that you just don't know which way it will land or has landed because you lack perfect knowledge.<p>I don't have a problem with not using probability to model lack of knowledge, but you have to apply that principle consistently (and whether it is ethically desirable to use probability is an entirely different and even more difficult question than whether or not it leads to accurate beliefs).

In 1986 Reagan passed the ""Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"". Since that time, hospitals are required to treat anyone, regardless of whether or not they have insurance, as if they were a fully insured patient. My wife, who is a physician in a busy hospital, consistently sees about 40% of her patients have no health insurance and are receiving free healthcare from that hospital. This may vary based on location, but I cant imagine by much. Hospitals foot the bill in this situation, and that is why costs to the insured are much higher.<p>Everybody seems to think they are smarter than everyone else when it comes to healthcare reform, but in all of the ""smoking gun"" articles that are posted, none of them have ever touched on this fact.<p>Even the new healthcare plan that passed does not address this directly, it assumes that the people who do not have healthcare will use a state healthcare exchange to get their own. I am a little pessimistic about this, and am assuming that only a small percentage of those people will do this.",1361811744

Not that flat-files should be used to do things that they inherently can't...but that too many projects (or hobby apps) don't consider them and then spend as much time figuring out how to keep their server from crashing. I find it pretty amazing that they have only one small EC2 instance for their news apps (this is separate from the NPR.org site overall) just to do cron jobs.<p>Flat files, of course, require good planning...not least of which involves an accurate gauging of how often an app's data needs to be refreshed.

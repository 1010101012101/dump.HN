In contrast, I work in the power industry and the involvement of a P.Eng. is usually a necessity at the design, construction and commissioning phases of utility electrical work.<p>Also, Canadian jurisdictions do not distinguish between disciplines of engineering in licensing, a Professional Engineer is responsible for self-regulating themselves to the areas of practice in which they are competent. That is, a Professional Engineer holding a degree in mechanical engineering can seal electrical schematics, if she feels that she is competent to do so.<p>In short, yes you can be a Professional Engineer as a software developer in Canada, but since most software work is not considered to be engineering under the official definition[1], one does not need to be a P.Eng. to do it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=1813&la_id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=1813&la_id=1</a>",1423353423

9015710,comment,9015370,9015573,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"The strange thing about the real world is that your salary is almost completely divorced from your actual skill.  Take a skilled person who never negotiates and the result is that they&#x27;re paid less than someone many times less skilled but who negotiates.<p>So it&#x27;s not necessarily about &quot;are you good enough?&quot; but rather &quot;how much do you want to get paid?&quot;  And once you focus on the latter question, you realize that skill is a tiny portion of it.  Your salary is mainly dominated by how much time you have to shop yourself around, how quickly you can get several offers from different companies, and how long you can afford to say &quot;no.&quot;  The last one is very important, because if you get through an interview stage and are unable to say &quot;no&quot; if you need rent for example, then you&#x27;ll end up with a low non-negotiable offer.  You can bluff, which is always worth attempting since I&#x27;m not aware of anyone who lost out on a job offer for bluffing, but if their initial offer is $X, and you say &quot;no, $X + $Y please&quot; and then they say &quot;$X + $5k is our final offer,&quot; then your options are to accept or to shop.  And if you have no time left to shop around, then you&#x27;re forced to settle.  That&#x27;s how you end up with a low salary.<p>All of this is obvious when someone explains it like that, but the trouble is, few people talk about stuff like this.  You can spend your time from college to career without even really examining any of this, to your personal detriment, and you won&#x27;t even realize it.  As Patrick said, you can easily get +$5k at your next job with a minimum of effort.  If you have time to shop around for several months, then you can get +$40k or more in the right circumstances.<p>Sorry for the ramble.

<i>Yes, the Greek voters have given their opinion but what about voters in other democracies? German voters, when polled, seem pretty clear that they don&#x27;t want Greece to be given debt forgiveness. Since they would bear the cost of a Greek write-off, why should their views count for nothing? And what about the Finns, Dutch, Austrians etc?</i>
—<p>For some reason ‘Buttonwood’ ignores Podemos in Spain, UKIP in the UK, M5S in Italy and LePen in France. All these anti-EU parties are leading the polls in their respective countries. It’s not something that <i>will happen in the future</i> it is something that it IS happening NOW.<p>The rhetoric has it that by punishing SYRIZA the current French, UK, Italian and Spanish governments can make a bad example out of Greece and reclaim lost votes. While to me seems a very unlikely outcome. No matter what will happen to Greece, LePen is going to win Frances election if Frances economy doesn’t change drastically in the next months. Same goes for Spain, Italy and the UK. The economy can not change following austerity prescription by the Germans unfortunately, that’s crystal-clear, so why are they sticking with austerity?!?<p>I might be wrong, I don’t know time will tell, but I get the feeling that people in key-positions throughout EU right now are severely under-educated.<p>The article was quite refreshing.

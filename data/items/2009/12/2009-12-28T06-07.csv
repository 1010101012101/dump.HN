There's a lot of room between ""unoriginal confirmist"" and ""whacked-out nutjob"".<p>I liked this article because it supports my personal biases, but it's worth noting that Medical Hypotheses is a unique journal that's not peer reviewed (despite being published by Elsevier), and is devoted to providing ""a forum for unconventional ideas without the traditional filter of scientific peer review.""<p>But, I agree with the article that the institutions of science bias too far in favor of the staid and obediently unoriginal type of student.

There is a lot of placebo product sold in the martial arts industry that is designed to make students feel good about themselves while falsely claiming to be effective.<p>The advent of MMA gave us hard evidence on which martial arts were real. If you can't grapple (wrestling, Jiu Jitsu, or Judo), then you have no business being in a fight with someone who can. The styles of striking that emphasized full-speed sparring and competition (western Boxing, Muay Thai) appear to be much more effective than traditional styles based on learning various forms and katas.<p>The very rule changes that allowed MMA to stay legal in the US have corrupted its use as a pure laboratory of combat. However it is still the best legal experiment for the testing of martial arts. There is nothing stopping a Nth-degree blackbelt from stepping into the cage to prove the validity of his discipline, except for Thai boxers accustomed to kicking people in the face.

1018237,comment,1017932,1018138,0,0,siculars,,,"Everything you mention is true including the readily apparent line of questioning for those traveling to Israel. What you should note, though, is not the acute subject of questioning but rather the method. A screener in any terminal in the world knows at the least two facts. One, the city of embarkation and two, the destination. With these two facts alone and not including any other known information, both overt and covert, a trained screener can weave together a battery of questions that would be quite difficult to answer untruthfully without rousing suspicion. I've had it done to me many times and no two times are the same. Always different.<p>Again, it is the method that is important. A specific answer to a specific question in itself is not important, rather the exchange as a whole is what paints a picture of the one being questioned. Lets take your line of questioning - A guy says ""I'm visiting friends... where? Comstock - it's near Sargent."" Now the screener may not know where that is so lets go with that... Oh, Comstock? Where is that from (lets say) New York? How are you getting there? Is someone picking you up or are you renting a car? Who is picking you up? Do you have a rental car reservation? Where will you be staying when you get there? And on and on. This is how screeners are trained to question.

I've done everything from belts to blankets, and even tried my hand at spinning yarn. Weaving is actually a lot like programming (the Jacquard loom was one of the first machines to use punchcards) in that you set the system up with a set of rules and then run it. Different systems give you different languages to express the pattern in, just like programming languages. The awesome thing about looms is that they're bootstrappable technology: give me some wood and tools and I can build a loom that I can then weave on. On top of that, the potential patterns you can create with these simple programs are innumerable, many of them quite beautiful.",1261981923

I do, though this belief is not based on faith. The argument for why reason is valid is given by Ayn Rand. You are not familiar enough with her argument to defeat or disprove it. Anyway, my response to your specific claims follows. I respect your wish to end the conversation, so I don't mind if you don't respond.<p><i>The mere fact that something is necessary for knowledge does not mean that it is true because it has not been established that we are able to know.

They are the only primary concepts that are implicit in and fundamental to all knowledge. Can you name some other concept for which this is the case? They are also self-evident, though they are not the only concepts for which this is the case. (By the way, self-evident does <i>not</i> mean ""obvious"".)<p><i>You're establishing a useless distinction: If you told my about a Faerie you saw one day and I believed you, then my belief would not be without evidence; your testimony counts as evidence. Doubtless, you consider that to be insufficient evidence, but it is evidence non-the-less. You are positing a 'faith' that no one, religious or not, holds.</i><p>My report of seeing a fairy could count as evidence if you consider me a credible source and if the properties I ascribe to it are not contradictory to other evidence. Religious faith does not have evidence to support it, because the Bible and religious leaders are not credible enough to outweigh the evidence that suggests that miracles and so forth are impossible. In fact, if you ask a religious person to justify their belief in their religion, ultimately, they will cite faith as the source of their belief. I am positing a ""faith"" that all religious people hold.<p><i>Not to put to fine a point on it, but what you seem to mean is that faith, as you define it, is a belief based in something other than Objectivism, which is also a useless (and subtly religious) definition.</i><p>Objectivism is not ""subtly religious"" because it is based on reason.

These all occurred in a span of two weeks, roughly in the same circumstances (I had to fly into Israel, fly out, fly back in, and fly back out).

Two of the times the agents were Israeli jews who immigrated from Russia.

The other two times, I was interviewed by jews of clearly middle-eastern descent - both had no understanding of my cultural background, and both thought my trip details were extremely suspicious, subjecting me to a detailed search. So the outcome of the interviews was effectively random, which means they might as well perform random searches.<p>The interviews were highly unethical, inappropriate, and degrading.

I'm thinking of spending $20,000 on a startup.<p>(I'm mentioning my total net worth in case theres someone who knows how to handle money better than I do, and can help me maybe use it as leverage for a startup.)<p>Questions:<p>1. Do you think I'm nuts to leave a good paying job (12K a month) in this economy?<p>2. How can I invest/manage the money so that I can maximise the amount of time I get to build a company.<p>3. Would you try to do the startup part time first? (I've been trying this for a while but it hasnt got any customers yet.)<p>4. Where should I live to maximise the amount of ""startup time"" that the $20,000 gives me? Do you think I should open up a ""startup house"" someplace?<p>Ideas I've been considering:<p>1. Live in India and come back for 6 months a year to keep my green card in status. Open up an office in India with 2 programmers.
2. Try to get consulting jobs on the side?
3. Ask my present employer for a part time job.
4. Buy or rent a whole house in which I can host a couple of other startups and thus save some money and create a very useful network to share in my future ""trials and tribulations"".<p>I would be grateful for any ideas that you might have.",1261981240

For instance the assistant could hold the cards in 2 different ways, 4 cards represents 16 bits of information, plus 2 more bits for which card is the high card.<p>Here is a simpler one that impresses many people.  Deal out 3 cards across, return to the top, 3 more cards, and so on until you've dealt out 27 cards in 3 columns.  Have the other person pick a card but don't indicate what it is.  Ask them to indicate which column has the card.  Stack the 3 columns with that in the middle.  Now redeal go through the same procedure.  Repeat one more time.  Now count the cards out.  Card #14 is the picked card.<p>Why does it work?

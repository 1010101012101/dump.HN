The ones who express safety concerns tend to be concerned by trucks and most don't consider cars at all.<p>> And, yes, I'm concerned with the prevalence of truck-sized vehicles.<p>That's nice but irrelevant because we're not talking about you.  We're talking about the motivations of people who buy big vehicles.  You remember them - you want them to do something different.<p>Those folks are concerned about actual trucks.  Cars don't much register.  We can argue about what they should be concerned about, but what they're actually concerned about is pretty clear.<p>> Look, I'm not pretending to have a significant sample size, or rigorous methods, but in terms of people I've observed in Houston Rush Hour, it's more like 100's.<p>And that's exactly my point.  Your observation just tells us that a lot of people commute alone.  It doesn't tell us what they do with those vehicles the rest of the time.<p>That's why I asked you how you know about their other usage.<p>Or, do you want to argue that their other usage is irrelevant?  It's fairly easy to show that the economics of multiple vehicles are tough....<p>> Been over in Europe lately?<p>Not in the last three years, but yes, multiple times, one time being three months in Demark.  I've recently been spending time in the Caribbean, Mexico, the Philippines, and the ABC islands.  I've started to pay for trips to the Galapagos, Fiji, and the Baltics.<p>I'm not sure why this is relevant, but since you do, let's see your passport log.",1245304789

663044,comment,662901,662937,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, it won't be in 1.1; the feature window came and went without significant progress on that ticket.<p>I have a suspicion, though, that (like many things people commonly claim Django's ORM can't do) it is possible to come at this through lesser-known/lesser-considered features. Off the top of my head I can think of two approaches.<p>In either case, I suspect the key thing to do is write a subclass of django.db.models.sql.query.Query which properly applies schema information when constructing the SQL (Query.get_from_clause() is probably the place to start).<p>Given the Query class implementing the proper behavior, the two approaches I'd look at are:<p>1. If schema information is only important for some models but not others, a manager class with an overridden get_query_set() (which returns a QuerySet initialized with an instance of the schema-aware Query) can be applied to the relevant models.<p>2. If schema information needs to be applied to all models, a subclass of the database backend can have its attribute uses_custom_query_class set True, and then the backend's query_class() method will be called to obtain the default Query class used for all queries from that backend.<p>Down the road, maybe somebody who really needs this feature will step up during the 1.2 feature-proposal window and work up the necessary bits to have Django do this natively.",1245303933
663043,comment,662951,663037,0,0,sachinag,,,"As a former analyst at a venture capital firm, with all due respect, you have no idea what you're talking about.<p>Regulation doesn't make VC any less attractive for LPs, who provide the funds.  As long as there are people who want to commit to the asset class, there will be VC funds willing and available to take their cash.<p>Furthermore, registration with the SEC increases paperwork, but not in a way that does anything other than provide additional transparency.  It's a bit of a pain in the ass, and maybe it means the CFO has more work to do, but to say this is dumb or will kill innovation is misguided.  It's the same damn paperwork that every mutual fund has to file.  It won't make or break any decent-sized fund.<p>Everything the NVCA says in their position paper is right (<a href=""http://www.magnetmail.net/images/clients/NVCA/attach/VCandSystemicRiskFinal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.magnetmail.net/images/clients/NVCA/attach/VCandSy...</a> [PDF]), but excluding VC funds from regulations when you want to look at PE and hedge funds - which can and do pose systemic risks, as we saw with LTCM - is impossible given that all three share the same basic legal structure: LPs and a GP, where the GP is the manager of the fund.<p>The societal cost of overextending mere registration requirements to VC funds is far outweighed by the cost of not having greater transparency into their PE and hedge fund siblings.",1245303932

Both can do more to drive away high-value industry than broad-based consumption taxes.<p>But if a non-regressive tax system is your goal, let's analyze Amazon's loophole for its progressivity:<p>Who benefits most from tax-free online shipping? It's definitely not the poor, who don't spend a lot on high-dollar, easy-to-ship-across-state-lines products bought with credit cards.<p>When rich people use this loophole to save money on their books/ipods/electronics/housewares, in-state retail businesses that employ less-skilled people and pay other taxes shrink. Because the transaction base is smaller, if there is a sales tax, the rate has to be higher -- and that covers things poor people buy with cash.<p>There might be a federalist argument for preventing individual states from compelling sales tax collection, even if states are allowed to charge a use tax or delivery fee.

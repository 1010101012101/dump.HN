Your summary doesn't seem to conflict with my post...  However, it also doesn't seem to quite fit what they said.<p>>  The hired management forced Sandy out by threatening to quit en masse if she didn't leave.<p>Don Valentine:<p>""Seven vice presidents of Cisco Systems showed up in my office.  We had a reasonably civil meeting in our conference room, the outcome of which was a very simple alternative:  Either I relented -- and allowed the President to fire Sandy Lerner -- or they, all seven, would quit.""<p>\n>  I got the impression that Don Valentine actually wished she could have stayed.<p>Sandy Lerner:\n""Don's opening words to me, you know, the first time I ever met that man -- I wouldn't have known him from the man on the Moon -- were, <i>""I hear you're everything that's wrong with Cisco.""</i><p>I didn't say they left in disgust, I said they sold their shares because of disgust with the way they were treated.",1177147492

Bill Joy may be one of the greatest C hackers of all time, but his NerdTV interview was one of the most boring things I've ever watched.<p>I think today it is <i>vital</i> for hackers to stay informed because the investors are also far more sophisticated and you need relevant information to help you get what you want.  If all you want to do all day is write code, then unrelated news that doesn't expand your thinking is a waste of time.  However, in that case you need a co-founder who <i>does</i> keep on top of everything and will represent your interests as strongly as you would have.<p>Besides that, I can't even count how many all-night debugging sessions were a product of the creeping IQ drop and would have taken all of 20 minutes the next day on normal sleep.\n",1177146505

It just feels different to be somewhere in SL, you are much more involved than on a web page. Also, is your own homepage really a place you go to to feel at home? I think we create web pages mostly to present ourselves to other people. In second life, on the other hand, people are creating homes for themselves just to hang out there and feel good. So I think a place like that would be much more suited for memorials. <p>Also, one question pops up: do you think people would rather create a memorial on a graveyard, or in some private place? The graveyard might be good because it makes you feel less alone, but technically it isn't really necessary.",1177146196

I spent a week doing a lot of React projects, and while it&#x27;s nice, it is what it is- a view layer.<p>When interacting with a complex web of routes, models, components, and templates, I have found Ember to be similar to Rails in terms of expressiveness and speed of development.<p>Then again, I don&#x27;t know a lot of the tools that people use to solve these problems in React- the most I ever encountered was having to do most things manually, but having page layout managed by React. I was still managing my M and C. What do you usually use to ease the work there?",1441259951
10163534,comment,10150684,10161268,0,0,pbsd,,,"Not sure I understand precisely what you&#x27;re asking. &#x27;Generic composition&#x27; is a tricky term, because it tends to hide the assumptions underlying what we&#x27;re actually composing together. Bellare and Namprempre&#x27;s paper, which is the most usually cited in this sort of discussion, takes a probabilistic encryption scheme (read: something that takes a random IV) and a MAC, and results in a probabilistic AE scheme. This is obviously not the only way to model encryption and authentication schemes (SIV above transforms those same primitives into a nonce-based AE scheme instead, or DAE with a fixed nonce), but this tends to be overlooked from GC discussions. In some models, MtE and friends is OK. But the truth is that EtM is safe in the widest range of assumptions, while the other ones are more brittle.",1441259935

I find the shape of that curve somehow pretty.  29% clearly can&#x27;t be a hard bound, since we can get 4.8% by assuming no false negatives.  I just wish I understood whether there is anything particularly natural about the number 29, or did they make their distributional assumptions for the same reasons you did: &quot;mainly for illustration&quot;.  If so, then the Nature article was terribly misleading by presenting that number as some kind of &quot;speed of light&quot;-type limit, because that makes p-values look worse than they really are.  It seems that p-values are bad enough without making up more bad stuff about them! :)<p>Anyway, thanks for all your help.

But if the players are not intelligent or are addicted, how will they choose &quot;better&quot; lotteries?

For example, I think we could all agree that working on 30 projects would be an ineffective way to spend time. Mark Cuban recommends &quot;1, not 50&quot; [1]. You have to pick your <i>best</i> candidate project and run with it, and what&#x27;s best depends on what your criteria are.<p>I think the term &quot;fear of failure&quot; is applied too broadly. Often this &quot;fear&quot; is more a healthy respect for the challenge of bringing highly functional yet simple experiences to your end user. Those experiences coupled with a product that solves a legitimate problem, absent any legal or bureaucratic barriers, is a recipe for winning. Understanding the intricacies of the challenge can make it difficult to find a single-threaded manner to work on it. It&#x27;s almost more of a logical bewilderment than it is fear.<p>If none of the ~30 projects are being worked on then maybe fear of failure or laziness might apply but it could still be a matter of prioritization.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5t-Hx8A7Y&t=34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5t-Hx8A7Y&t=34</a>",1441259251

Nevertheless, it is not conceptual consistency but expectations that should drive interactions. A difficult balance, given that consistency also improves accuracy of expectations but if you take big vendors, that consistency approach was taken to the limits by BPC. This is why everything feels like 10 extra steps. When someone creates artefacts they should be immediately available. The only thing that should necessitate a metadata application from a user perspective should be metadata (as in dimensions changes, not even member additions) and logic changes (if you need to optimise your calculations graph.) The rest should be transparent and separated at least visually from metadata. You can keep security in metadata, but calculation is a separate concept and you will most probably have to separate it when, as per your roadmap, you look into workflows. Do not get confused by the consistency. Look at the concepts from a user perspective and hide elegance in implementation if you can. I hope this helps. I will send you an email and we can discuss in more detail.",1441258003

It doesn&#x27;t matter the questions asked (i.e. whether social security exists, whether you want to travel, etc), the point is to consider what YOU want out of retirement. Nobody can answer your original question specifically as there is no one specific X dollar answer to the question. What my definition of living comfortably in retirement is and what I could retire on is most likely going to be completely different than yours.<p>You don&#x27;t sound &quot;arrogant, insulting, or condescending&quot;, but the way you come off in your answer is that you want someone to give you a specific number (let&#x27;s say X) without providing any context as to what you expect out of your retirement. You come off sounding as if you don&#x27;t want to take anyone&#x27;s advice or answer anyone&#x27;s questions yet you want them to answer your question.<p>You don&#x27;t have to predict anything or know the specific answer to any question, and I think that is where you are misinterpreting the questions. There is no right or wrong answer to the questions, they are only asked to gather details about your perceptions. Your answers are then used to compare to known financial data to determine a good retirement amount. They are &quot;real&quot; questions. If you have no intention of having kids or being married, that is significantly going to impact the amount of money you need to retire. If you plan to sell your belongings and live in an RV and travel the country till you die that is going to impact the number. While these may change down the road, you plan for the future on what you know now. You say you plan to live/retire in the mid-west. How do you know that is not going to change in a year.<p>From my own personal perspective I plan for my retirement based on what I foresee my future holding. I work with a financial planner to determine a good investment strategy based on those plans. However, I am consistently reevaluating those plans on an annual basis. My adviser asks me similar questions. But he also uses freely available data on what current retirees are doing based on the economy. He evaluates my strategy against the pros/cons of what current retirees are seeing in their retirement. I don&#x27;t know how much my kid&#x27;s education will cost, but I do know I want to pay, or at least help pay, for that. I base my planning number on current costs and add a cost increase for each year based on previous history of cost increases. The questions are not meant to be answered specifically, they are simply meant to get you thinking about your future and where you see yourself. You are right no one knows what it will cost in the future and you are right you can make assumptions based on past numbers. However, in order to use the numbers from the past you need to know what numbers to use. Thus the point of the questions.<p>With all that said, I am not going to go back and forth with you here. I am not a financial planner. I can&#x27;t answer your question specifically.

We’re here to change that – CS+Social Good is Stanford’s first student group focusing on the intersection of computer science and social impact.
We realized that many students would love to contribute to social good projects, but may not have the guidance or technical knowledge to do so. After seeing how much interest and demand existed surrounding tech for good on Stanford’s campus and outside, we’re offering a new class – CS+Social Good: Using Web Technologies to Change the World. This class, CS90SI, will be taught at Stanford by our team this fall and will be a unique environment where students can learn web technologies by working on real world projects focused on creating positive social change.<p>Project partners like Google, LaborVoices, SIRUM and Delhi Government will support students as they work on small teams to implement high-impact projects. From creating ‘aha’ learning moments for students to matching pharmacies with surplus medications, students will learn and leverage technology to truly build for good and impact hundreds of millions of people. Amazing speakers, social entrepreneurs, and humanitarians like Jane Coyne, a board member of Doctors without Borders, Laura Arrillaga Andreessen, one of the world&#x27;s most famous philanthropists, will visit the class to share their inspiring stories.<p>You can learn more about the class at cs90si.stanford.edu. Videos of the class will also be put online on the website. You can keep a tab of our updates on our updates page at cs90si.stanford.edu/blog/index.html and follow us on Twitter at @cs90si<p>Thanks, Manu Chopra (Class Instructor)",1441256424

That&#x27;s essentially what colonial powers did.  They won over the people at first by force (conquered)  and then via other means they coopted (won over) them and used them to their ends. Then at some point many colonies resented the remote and distanced governance and rebelled.",1441256412

I&#x27;m very grateful to have a common name. Nate Perkins is about as generic as it gets. Global searches for my name come up with a variety of people completely unrelated to me.<p>Still, there are potential downsides. For instance, searching for &quot;[my name] [my city]&quot; brings up a mugshot of someone who isn&#x27;t me. And of course, Stephen Law of the original post has a much more frustrating issue.<p>None of us are really in a position to say with certainty &quot;it&#x27;s better to have a common name than an uncommon one&quot; or vice versa.<p>I would argue that pseudonymity is necessary to overcome negative situations arising from having a common name <i>or</i> having an uncommon name. But this argument is strictly from my own experience and should be taken as such.<p>Like most things, it comes down to the importance of teaching kids to think critically about how their choices will affect themselves and their environment rather than accepting truisms not backed by relevant statistics.",1392415069

Also, consistent with the true nature of narcissists, they&#x27;re secretly insecure about themselves and their abilities, which is the real motive for making their code incomprehensible -- to do otherwise might reveal how perfectly ordinary their code really is, and they really are.<p>> Why is it a best practice to write functions that only do one thing? Because as soon as the function is doing multiple things, it can get very very confusing as to what exactly is going on, even for the best programmers.<p>That&#x27;s a good argument in favor of OO programming, where one writes a class instead of a mere function, thus avoiding the trap of trying to create multi-purpose functions.",1392414243

Also rvm and its descendants were created to handle Rails app deployments, and are especially useful for situations where you&#x27;re switching between lots of projects with different ruby version and library dependencies, which is typical in Rails client work.<p>- Standard library: The `Object#tap` method came from ActiveSupport. Also, ActiveSupport had an OrderedHash, and now all hashes are ordered. I think there are some other examples of that sort of thing.<p>- Performance: I really don&#x27;t know what has driven performance improvements have been made, but it doesn&#x27;t seem outlandish to think that backlash against poor CPU and (especially) memory usage characteristics of Rails applications was a contributor.",1392413780

The vast majority of people in these cities (~85-90%) are renting the homes that they live in (also know as their primary dwelling) - either a living room, bedroom, or their whole home when they are gone. 60% of them depend on the money they make to pay their rent or mortgage - this according to the surveys we have done for our economic impact studies. These people were living in these homes before Airbnb, so they had a choice to either move out and find a cheaper place (presumably in a different neighborhood or out of the city) since they cannot afford the vacant space, or put it on Airbnb. Many of these people are self employed or under employed. A classic example are artists. This was my story when I moved to San Francisco. If these people moved out, the likely new tenants would be people who could afford to move in without renting on Airbnb. Now, of course some people could move in with the intention of renting on Airbnb. We are not saying this never happens. What we are saying is that more people are using Airbnb to keep their homes than using it as means of displacing people.

The typical high school student now has access as much or more knowledge and computational power than the most powerful people 20 or 30 years ago. The power is so immense yet at the same time imperceptible to most. An iPhone? A place to play Candy Crush.<p>The few who figure it out immediately drop everything they are doing and start a technology company (I did.)<p>However, when we examine areas that are greatly influenced by inflationary pressures things look really bad. Healthcare basically means if you have a family you need to spend $1000 a month on something that you will only use in a dire emergency because you&#x27;ll pay thousands of dollars out of your pocket before it kicks in. Education, I don&#x27;t even have to mention.<p>Real estate is the other big area. Real estate is a finite resource. Even if there is unlimited resources and energy there is not unlimited land. The areas that are most influenced by the global banking system appear to have the most extreme divergence in real estate costs -- London, NYC, SF/Silicon Valley, Hong Kong, etc. The upper end of the prices in there areas are in complete fantasy land to everyone else.<p>Technology start ups sit right in the middle of all of this. Incredible deflationary gains thanks to science and technology, insane pricing thanks to a global banking system flush with cash -- for now at a rate that has been subsidizing borrowers at the cost of savers.<p>The good news is that if you run a start up, even if there is a global slowdown economically, science & technology deflation will carry you along.

216909,comment,216835,216835,0,0,drawkbox,,,"You must build first.  It is much easier to sell and you have more pull with a completed or ready system.  Also, unless you have real professional experience you can't call that 4 years experience.  If I could count my experience back to my C64 days and Apple II days then it would be highly inflated.  Experience usually means professional work experience, at 18 you need to prove yourself more.  Deliverables help this immensely and once you throw down experience means minimal.<p>The hard part is building and getting noticed, once that happens the investment part is much easier.  Truly great business ventures dont' always need lots of investment though, just enough to buy some time to build it or get it in production.",1213376264
216908,comment,216381,216883,0,0,hhm,,,"I'm not sure I understand. Suppose the mind throws a thousand dices. We measure two possible events: if there is at least a dice with a 1 on it, and if all dices have a 1 on it.<p>There are 6^1000 possible conscious minds. We call Lefty to the one that sees the first, very probable event. We call Righty to the one that sees the second, very unprobable event. There is actually only one Righty, but there are many, many Lefties. So it's actually a lot more probable to be a Lefty than to be a Righty. I think this works too with any other kind of event you could imagine (at least in a discrete (meta?)world, I'm not sure how you could have continuous probabilities if there are only discrete amounts of worlds available, or if you can have continuous amounts of worlds instead).<p>How does what you say work in this example? Why would both events have the same probability?<p>I don't know about QM more than the very, very basics, so please excuse me if I'm not understanding something very fundamental here.",1213376160

216902,story,,,1,0,ideas101,"Ask YC: what do you think of Yahoo/Google deal?",,"I think it is too early to say that yahoo made a mistake - to me it is the safest (if not smartest) decision ever. I have very logical point of view:<p>1. Sometimes leasing is more profitable than selling, and that is what Yahoo has done. Instead of selling search business to MSFT, they leased it out (temporarily) to Google. Also it is not known how much msft was offering for yahoo's search business anyway may be it wasn't that profitable in the long run.<p>2. Yahoo/Google deal is only for north-american market. Agreed that it is the biggest market right now but not for the future, as everyone has predicted, future belongs to BRIC (brazil, russia, china, india). Asian and BRIC is the biggest search market one can ever think of, so it is wise that Jerry will take time and resources from north-american team away (as they may not be required any more due to google deal) for now and try to come up with technology/platform that caters to these markets. May be he has a plan to test its Panama platform for these markets and get it mature by the time it is reaped to start making money.<p>3. It is true that desktop search market is the biggest right now but in the future the search on other platform such as smart-phones is bigger than desktop - and Yahoo can start looking in to it with the help of freed resources.<p>4. Google is king in text search ads market and not in display ads, according to google executives, yahoo still is the market leader in display ads and it is a huge revenue generator (remember micrsoft was interested in buying yahoo's search business was due to its strong position in display ads). Yahoo can work on the same technology platform to keep bringing more money thru this kind of ads. Also display ads are going to play a bigger role in mobile phone market so it is wise to concentrate on your strength.<p>5. Yahoo has a strong presence in China, Google is still lacking in getting major revenue from this market. Jerry being from the same ethnic background can understand this market much better than anyone else ... also Yahoo is already deep rooted in china, it has to just find out how to monetize it efficiently.<p>6. In couple of years yahoo will know how much it can make from this deal(with Google) and if it is mature enough to sell the north-american search business than it would do so by making much more money than what MSFT is offering right now.<p>7. Last but not least - It is better that Jerry is more loyal to the people who are loyal to him (employees and endusers) than to be loyal who are least loyal (shareholders) to yahoo ...<p>Conclusion: it is not a worst decision and only time will tell what a smart move it was (or it wasn't). Jerry needs some time to prove it and now he has got what he wanted to prove his caliber and witty decision making capabilities.",1213375910

Coding to a spec, even at the level of BDD, simply means making your implementation conform to some abstract behavioral specification.<p>If writing code that could both adhere to such as spec and was easily maintained and extended in the future were <i>easy</i>, then outsourcing (or simply relying on the most junior programmers you could hire) would definitely be the only sane way to build software.<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately, if you are a developer who wants to work and knows your craft) it is not nearly so simple. Even a perfect functional spec is usually at least 3-4 levels of abstraction removed from the actual code needed to implement it.<p>More fine-grained BDD specs or unit tests may come closer to allowing for mostly mechanical translation into working code, but they also must co-evolve with the code itself.",1213374934

The problem is that even if you tell the program that face A is not face B, all you've done is given it a very small hint in a VERY big problem space.  The human brain is hard-wired to detect faces (newborn babies prefer to look at pictures of human faces rather than colorful shapes), which I think makes it feel like an easier problem than it actually is.<p>That being said, don't let me stop you from trying.

Even in history circles people debate how important history is if the lessons can be handed down via knowledge of good-practices.<p>If you want to know <i>how good you've got it</i> now, I'd start with building a site that uses entirely static content. After you've got a few pages, make a change that affects all of these pages. You'll see how static pages lead to redundancy and a lesson will be learned.<p>Then setup a cgi based commenting system in either c or perl, which would arguably represent the start of interactive web sites. From here, you'll see that there are things you'd like to store, like a username, and you'll understand how frameworks make following a user easy.<p>Once you've done these two things, add some database support for the comments and a way to search the comments.<p>I'd say, after these three things, you'll have a pretty good understanding of how slick things like rails are and you can go back to being as productive as possible with respect for the problems it's solving.

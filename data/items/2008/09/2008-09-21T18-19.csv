""I can learn any language in a week"" I thought - as long as it is Python or Java or something closely resembling, it turned out. Gave up fairly quickly.<p>Second time I was serious, invested a significant amount of time, but still gave up when I reached monads.<p>Then I taught myself scheme and worked my way through SICP, just to be better prepared. Now I'm trying again, and it makes a little more sense, but I'm still stuck at monad transformers.<p>If someone can learn Haskell in a week I hate them. And I hate all monad tutorials. ""Monads are easy, they are just like a conveyor belt"" ""No, they are just like a spacesuit!"" ""Monads are like a box of apples, that magically transforms into a box of oranges!"" ""No, its easy: Monads are just like green monsters whits eats values, but when you kill the monsters they puke the values out again - you could have invented them yourselves! Perhaps you already have!""",1222022812

Your CV perhaps?<p>Anyone looking, a recruiter for example, will have done countless similar searches and will know what looks natural.  One result and then a bunch of mis-spellings will probably raise suspicion.  I can understand trying to get rid of your embarrassing spring break photos but YC is only going to give a neutral or, more likely, positive impression and keep things looking natural.",1222022330

He explicitly says that it will buy assets at above market prices (although he still claims that they are undervalued) because the holders won't sell at market prices. Anna Eshoo pressed him on how the government can compel the holders to sell, and he basically dodged the question. I think that's because he didn't want to admit that the government would just keep offering more and more.</i>",1222021909

I don't care that they reject apps they don't like on <i>their own service</i> for <i>their own device</i>.  I do care that they let some through that are really unpolished.  If I made a really stellar app and put lots of time and effort into it, I would hate for it to drown in a sea of inferior half-assed apps.<p>The App Store is for business.

Stephenson one of the few current authors that's not afraid to spend a hundred pages setting up the backstory for everything going on.

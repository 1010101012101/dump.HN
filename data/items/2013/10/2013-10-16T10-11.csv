Its simple, slow, and uncluttered-and it reveres authenticity above all. Wabi-sabi is flea markets, not warehouse stores; aged wood, not Pergo; rice paper, not glass. It celebrates cracks and crevices and all the other marks that time, weather, and loving use leave behind. It reminds us that we are all but transient beings on this planet-that our bodies as well as the material world around us are in the process of returning to the dust from which we came. Through wabi-sabi, we learn to embrace liver spots, rust, and frayed edges, and the march of time they represent.<p>-Tadao Ando<p>It&#x27;s another way I guess about looking at fashion and what you wear without care (or a little bit of care at least).",1381920929

Getting rich was seen as a reward since you provided a good solution to consumers and therefore you could gain from the overall value you provided to society.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s ever been the case in the US. There&#x27;s long been an ideal that anyone can become prosperous, in the sense of upper-middle-class; that&#x27;s the &quot;American Dream&quot;. But people have also long been skeptical of the very wealthy, and in the early US there was even an ideal (though a pretty counterfactual one) that the US didn&#x27;t really have any super-rich, in contrast to the British, but rather was a nation of approximate equals, everyone a tradesman, shopkeeper, yeoman farmer, etc.<p>The 19th-century industrialists were very unpopular among the general population, especially in the period before several of them made extensive efforts to improve their popularity through PR and philanthropy. Some of the industrialists themselves were even conflicted about the role of extreme wealth in society, which motivated writings like Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot;, in which he argued that the wealthy had an obligation to spend their wealth to improve society through philanthropy, and ought not to either spend it purely on personal luxury, or to keep it and produce hereditary family fortunes in the old European style.",1381920876

It&#x27;s really just a matter of training users that downloading random code from random URLs is risky.<p>Once locked-down distribution hits critical mass, you can probably get away with making it even more difficult and obvious-to-the-user-he-is-doing-something-risky in &quot;sideloading&quot; applications.

I think this is the main benefit that the user can get from a social bookmarking site - the ability to see the &quot;bookmarks of others that are similar to your bookmarks&quot;. The implementation is not too complex and nicely covered in the book [2] with examples in Python. The book even has a special section &quot;Building a del.icio.us Link Recommender&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m not mistaken, there were prototypes for doing collaborative filtering of Delicious dataset written by standalone applications. But doing such filtering requires direct access to the database and cannot be done efficiently via HTTP. So, after the current team had bought Delicious from Yahoo, I thought that implementing collaborative filtering would be their main priority. Instead of that, they concentrate forces on worsening and cluttering UI experience along with breaking various Delicious bookmarking plugins for popular browsers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering</a>

What I love about HN and Reddit is that I can get through someone&#x27;s 600-word comment and be thoroughly enlightened or angered and not care or even notice that it was authored by tptacek or some long-time lurker with just 50 karma. It&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve read HN frequently that I quickly associate tptacek&#x27;s handle (if I stop to look at the handle) with having karma...otherwise, he&#x27;s just some other commenter with something very insightful or aggravating to read...HN&#x27;s design rightfully de-eephasizes the authority given by identity to a comment and submission, letting the content stand for itself. This is the exact opposite the USQ forum&#x27;s current design, with Twitter handles overpowering everything else, even the already too-large and boldened headlines.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t mind the use of Twitter handles. I think the avatars should be axed, though, and perhaps the handles should be moved to the far right so that the user has to read the headline before being able to notice the submitter name.

As the article points out, Google only started competing about 5 years ago after Microsoft had started failing in those categories.<p>Firefox had been eroding at IE and changing people perception of internet and web browsers for more than a decade. Failure by MS to compete with Firefox is what allowed Google to put the last nail in IE coffin.<p>Mobile OS war really started 6 years ago after the iPhone basically reset the expectations. Google and Microsoft started at the same stage to compete against Apple. Ballmer could not have had the foresight that Google would compete in a category that did not exist yet. Or if he could predict the smartphone/tablet resolution they would just have bought Android before Google.<p>About the PC OS. So what about the netbooks that had MS sweating years before Google took interest in the category. And again, Google took interest only because it was/is basically abandoned by all the player.

The company doesn&#x27;t really understand simplicity.<p>I remember a post here about someone who worked at MS and how everyone just sorta waft through their jobs without wondering what else is out there. No one worries about Linux or other platforms really. No one explores new ways to do things or even fixing things that aren&#x27;t solving an immediate problem. The description is hard to believe and reads like a dystopian city, but it&#x27;s a good indication of why MS is going the way of the dinosaur.<p>In many ways it&#x27;s the opposite problem Google has. They&#x27;ve gone above and beyond the simplifying and basically circled everything they offer around one account. So far, the closest thing MS has to offer is Live sign in, and even that is well after Chromebook in Windows 8.<p>Microsoft has always been about making it easy to buy. Not necessarily to keep and maintain. With most services Google offer, I literally expend no effort with upkeep. It&#x27;s simple and it just works... well the Gmail UI is arguably worse now, but that&#x27;s another topic.",1381919448

We charge a fixed monthly fee of $600 for each custom SSL certificate you associate with your CloudFront distributions, pro-rated by the hour. For example, if you had your custom SSL certificate associated with at least one CloudFront distribution for just 24 hours (i.e. 1 day) in the month of June, your total charge for using the custom SSL certificate feature in June will be (1 day / 30 days) * $600 = $20.

I remember how awesome it felt in comparison to Yahoo Mail: (1) file uploads were handled after hitting &quot;Send&quot;, instead of disrupting the writing of your message like the other web interfaces did, (2) it came with huge online storage, (3) searching emails actually worked which in combination with the huge storage meant that I stopped deleting emails, (4) spam simply stopped hitting my Inbox (a real problem with my Yahoo Mail account, which made my Y! account unusable), (5) it was the only free email service I knew that provided POP3/SMTP access and then later I noticed (6) conversation threads.<p>Ever since Gmail was invitation-only, it has been awesome on multiple levels. It has its ups and downs, but if I am to think of products that have been almost perfect ever since version 1, Gmail is right up there with iPhone 1 - i.e. missing features, but so useful and refreshing.<p>How can you fail to mention that Internet Explorer, ever since version 6, became the main barrier for adopting web standards, as development on it simply stopped for several years, with the team being sent to work on other things, like Silverlight? How can you fail to mention Firefox for that matter? In 2006 Firefox version 2 was barely released. It then grew to over 20% of market-share, without Mozilla making aggressive deals for prebundling it. Internet Explorer isn&#x27;t losing to Chrome only, it&#x27;s losing to Firefox and Safari too and they ended up in this position by their own incompetence or malevolence.<p>There was a time when Microsoft was serving their customer&#x27;s needs.

Removing suites in SSL/TLS that uses them is a pretty simple step. Moving _from_ good suites _to_ these suites is the totally wrong way to go.",1381917876

Two or three years from now, Apple will be lucky to have 7% of the global smart phone market. The only thing left is for the iPhone to be squeezed into an ever smaller corner, as Windows did to them last time. Tech markets like these are almost always winner take 95%.<p>Over the next three years, Android will take over 80% of the tablet market as well. The iPad will potentially suffer an even worse fate than the iPhone market share wise, because the subsidies aren&#x27;t going to be there for much of the tablet market. The iPad will be competing with $125 and $200 tablets that are 90% as good at half the price. The outcome has always been obvious.",1381917767

What at all will you call a best app today that will drive someone to buy an Iphone instead of say, android because an equivalent one or even the same app isn&#x27;t available at the Play Store?<p>Yes, there are a lot of poor apps in the Play store but I can find similar ones on iTunes.

It is there to make the deluxe 5S seem a &#x27;bargain&#x27;, that is all. This makes purchasing the 5S a lot easier for the customer, psychologically.<p>As for Apple cutting orders due to weak demand, they simply placed a large initial order with their suppliers to get a better price. They probably told them it was going to sell like hot cakes when all along they only needed a modest quantity. They now go back to them and say &#x27;sorry folks we won&#x27;t be needing so many for the next order&#x27; and the suppliers walk away wishing they had charged more per unit with the first order.<p>Note this article is thin on sources and the angle implied - &#x27;weak demand&#x27; is just interpretation.",1381917601

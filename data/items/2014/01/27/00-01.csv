I didn&#x27;t mean to misrepresent your position -- I took &quot;The obvious explanation here is that the USPS fucked up&quot; to mean you belived it couldn&#x27;t be otherwise, rather than when weighing the evidence the more obvious [simpler] explanation is that USPS screwed up.<p>Like you, I&#x27;m also a big proponent of Occam&#x27;s razor. (Having been a med student, you don&#x27;t know how many times I heard that &quot;think horses not zebras&quot; analogy from attendings.) I guess it just comes down to the degree of faith each of us has in the NSA and their corporate partners. Some of us are more willing to doubt their actions and/or believe it&#x27;s possible they could screw up this way. But at this point we can only wait and see if we learn anything more in the coming days -- though probably not. One would hope the NSA is competent enough to cover this up, even if it was their screw up.<p><i>Added:</i> BTW, there is another explanation that no one has mentioned. Leaving the Alexandria issue aside, the NSA interception program obviously relies on participation from one or more corporate partners. And just as we&#x27;ve seen at the telcos, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that there are staff at those partners who aren&#x27;t particularly enthusiastic about the program. So it&#x27;s possible someone decided to &quot;accidentally&quot; bypass/skip an important step that would have obscured this. It&#x27;s not a huge leap to imagine a motivated techie realizing that this particular delivery would be an ideal opportunity to direct a lot of attention to the interception program -- if they felt compelled to take the risk. I&#x27;m definitely not saying this is the (or even <i>a</i>) likely possibility, but it&#x27;s probably the only way we&#x27;ll ever know if it was in fact the NSA.",1390783720

7127952,comment,7100764,7107144,1,0,colin_mccabe,,,"Berkeley has been a hotbed of political protest for a long, long time.  While I lived there, the Oak Grove protests, (protesting the cutting down of some trees to build a stadium) were going on.  Most of the fellow Berkeley residents I talked to were not in favor of the tree protesters, simply because the university was planting more trees in other places, so that there would actually be a net gain of trees due to the construction.  Prior to Oak Grove, there were the protests surrounding the army recruitment offices.  And prior to that, I&#x27;m sure there was another cause, all the way back to Vietnam, where Berkeley was also a famous center of protest.<p>The protests in San Francisco are very different from the ones in Berkeley.  The San Francisco ones are basically concerned about the effect the Google buses are having on the composition of the neighborhood.  The idea is that SF is perfect as-is and must not change.  There were similar worries when gays started moving into SF in the 70s and 80s.<p>I think the reason why you&#x27;re &quot;talking past&quot; me and the other people here is that you haven&#x27;t really visited most of the neighborhoods outside SF, and you think they&#x27;re all the same.  Hence the apparent non-sequiturs like bringing up Oak Brook, Illinois, or trying to decide whether something is a &quot;city&quot; or a &quot;town.&quot;  The reality is that different places are different.  Berkeley is not SF.  San Mateo is not downtown San Jose.  And downtown San Jose is not east San Jose.<p>An &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality, coupled with lack of knowledge of &quot;them,&quot; lies behind a lot of ugly things in human nature.  Do we really need to have more of it here?  Maybe there are places outside of SF that are (gasp) as good as parts of SF.  Maybe there are places in SF that kind of suck.  Is it possible?",1390783429

I envision noot as a simpler, nicer alternative to Anki, with more stuff hidden behind the hood (for example, answers can only be right or wrong, instead of Again, Hard, Good, or Easy) so people can just focus on their material and not spend hours configuring and designing templates for their cards. Also, Anki doesn&#x27;t currently have a good way to sync cards; AnkiWeb feels outdated and more centered around the computer version of the application.

There are many other talented songwriters and producers out there - Babyface is one, I&#x27;m sure there are others.<p>Songwriters and producers don&#x27;t get their due though (unless they also sing).  Back in the day, I used to read CD liner notes to get to know the producers behind the songs I liked.  But I always paid more attention to producers than songwriters: for some songs it&#x27;s hard to know which one out of the five listed songwriters was the real creative force; songs with samples will often have lots of unrecognizable names; and I&#x27;ve always valued producers as being more critical to a song&#x27;s success than songwriters.",1390781687

You might be right (probably are, for all I know), but you have no reason to believe so other than pure faith.<p>Ask yourself this (and answer truthfully): A year ago - did you believe that the NSA is actively sabotaging standards, intercepting shipments in order to modify the software to be under their control, etc? If you didn&#x27;t (and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve had the conspiracies mentioned), then why on earth would you believe &quot;the official word&quot; on anything like remote control of a car?<p>You might have a lot of faith in the official status-quo for no reason at all.",1390780994

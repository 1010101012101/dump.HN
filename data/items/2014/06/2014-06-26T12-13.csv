The essence of the theory is that businesses should be liable for the risks created by their employees acting within the scope of their employment.<p>However, respondeat superior does not apply when the tortfeasor (the person who acted negligently) is an independent contractor. When it comes to employees, a business can reduce incidences of negligence through training, setting procedures, etc. They exert a great deal of control over <i>how</i> the employee does his work. That&#x27;s not true in the case of independent contractors, like Uber drivers.",1403787563

Should he fear repression?<p>Me: > There is little evidence that the NSA monitoring was used for repression of citizens, and even less evidence of the sort of repression that was rampant in the Soviet bloc<p>You: > Do you think that people who want fundamental change in the US are not harassed and repressed, and their activities criminalized?<p>The context of the discussion is literally about whether the US is better than the Soviet Union. And is is, by a huge margin.<p>It&#x27;s not about settling, it&#x27;s about not derailing a discussion about NSA overreach and legitimate democratic issues in the US (and most other western countries) by making hyperbolic comparisons that aren&#x27;t even in the same league.<p>But even then, the article you linked to is not even remotely evidence of anyone being &quot;harassed and repressed, and their activities criminalized&quot; in any sense, Soviet or otherwise.

7949325,comment,7948787,7949051,1,0,jmckib,,,"There are already two powerful forces protecting consumers, reputation and tort law. A taxi service with poor service will not be in business for long, because its reputation will crumble, and if the service is truly negligent (for example, by driving vehicles that are in dangerously poor shape), the customer who is harmed can sue, not to mention traffic laws that already punish any driver who endangers other drivers on the road.<p>You say that foreigners don&#x27;t know anything, but I think most travelers would disagree. When I travel to a foreign country, I am still fully capable of researching the best hotels and restaurants, despite not speaking the native tongue. Taxi service isn&#x27;t any different.<p>I&#x27;m not saying all consumer protection laws are unnecessary, but you have to remember that regulation has a cost. Of course, there&#x27;s the cost in tax money, but also the fact that regulations are slow to change when necessary. Perhaps the largest risk is regulatory capture, which we&#x27;ve clearly seen in the taxi industry in a number of places. For example, from the linked article:<p>> In France, the proposed remedy was simple: a mandated delay of 15 minutes between ordering a ride from Uber and the passenger pick-up.<p>I find it inconceivable that this sort of regulation is meant to protect consumers. Clearly its only purpose is to protect the profits of traditional taxis.",1403787413

7949305,comment,7948310,7949034,1,0,lliwta,,,"> Spreadsheets are a great example of a declarative ethos.<p>I kind-of agree. The primitives do have many nice properties.<p>> You&#x27;re nitpicking on details which equally applies to prolog too.<p>I strongly disagree.<p>When escape hatches exist, I think you have to look at how a language/system is commonly used in order to assess whether it has some of these properties or not. Otherwise everything in which a pure function is definable becomes declarative and the phrase becomes rather useless.<p>Prolog and spreadsheets differ in a rather fundamental, albeit empirical, way: spreadsheet users tend to make pervasive use of the these imperative features.<p>So there are two alternatives -- spreadsheet programmers are all completely inexperienced and have no idea what&#x27;s good for them, or there are fundamental limits to the declarative features of the spreadsheet model, beyond which they become imperative.<p>I think the answer is a bit of both. Spreadsheet users tend to not be trained software engineers, but they aren&#x27;t idiots and basic programming is not rocket science. None-the-less, lots of spreadsheets end up with pervasive use of imperative features (which causes real problems in terms of maintainability)<p>So assuming a huge population of users are at least kind-of competent/intelligent, there appear to be fundamental limitations to the basic model, beyond which it can&#x27;t be used to solve common problems effectively in a declarative way.<p>Which of course should be interpreted by those who really like spreadsheet programming as a call to arms (education and/or refinements to the model) rather than a categorical criticism...",1403786859

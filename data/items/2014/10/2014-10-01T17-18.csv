I have a script which runs out of cron at 1 minute one minute after the hour and spends about 60 seconds repeatedly looking up host names that doesn&#x27;t exist and reporting if the lookups return SERVFAIL instead of NXDOMAIN. The script returns occasional errors when run in AWS, but returns absolutely no errors when run outside of AWS.<p>The domain I&#x27;m looking up records in is hosted by Dyn through their DynECT service, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s relevant since I&#x27;ve confirmed that the errors only occur when the AWS nameserver is in the loop.<p>Amazon&#x27;s DNS servers are notoriously unreliable, but we&#x27;ve never seen this particular failure mode before; the usual failure more is that DNS simply doesn&#x27;t work at all on a particular instance and we have to terminate and replace it. Certainly, we&#x27;ve never seen a failure mode where the all the errors occur on an hourly cycle like this.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for from HN is:<p>1) Are you seeing similar behavior in your AWS deployments?<p>2) Would you be able to run a script similar to the one I&#x27;m running to find out if you can reproduce the issue?<p>If I can collect evidence that this is happening to lots of people rather than just us, I have a better chance of convincing Amazon to pay attention to it.<p>Thanks!",1412186121

It is written in Python and currently runs on Linux so we are looking to adapt it for Windows.<p>This is a great opportunity to work with a small, very engineering-focused company at an early stage of development working with very interesting technologies.  The project will have a big impact on our customers.  Plus, the agent is open sourced so this work benefits the community and will give the developer something they can point at for future employers.  Finally, this project could result in more ongoing work in the months / years to come.<p>The main tasks will include:<p>* Create a build process that will bundle the Python agent as a Windows executable and run it as a Windows service (using something like py2exe)<p>* Create an installer<p>* Develop a mechanism to allow our users to easily update the agent when new releases are made<p>* Write code to collect relevant system metrics from the Windows server<p>We are looking for candidates who meet the following requirements:<p>* Windows expert, focusing on Window Services and best practices<p>* Have built Windows executables from Python on previous projects<p>* Have created installers for Windows<p>* Must be willing to provide ongoing support (which we will pay for as needed)<p>Interested?

The business model is different from Mike&#x27;s. Developers support the project by purchasing a monthly subscription at $19/mo. As an incentive to support the project, I write in-depth tutorials about Rails, which only the subscribers get. Some people subscribe because they want to keep the project going, and others subscribe just to get the tutorials. Either way, it&#x27;s over 500 subscribers right now. I&#x27;m not sure how many other open source projects could use this business model (maybe you need to be a writer as well as a developer) but it&#x27;s a route to consider if you want to make a living doing open source.

8396374,comment,8395422,8395422,5,0,zackmorris,,,"Happened to me too, lost about $350 on one client and $1100 on another.  The first one was dissatisfied with my work and kept demanding more and more minute changes to reach even the first milestone (essentially a feature creep issue).  The second paid initially but I made the mistake of finishing the work on the promise of a final payment which never came.  I just ate it.<p>The truth of the matter is that loosing a grand and a half to learn the F U pay me principle is probably pretty cheap.  What hurts more is the time I lost (6 weeks to the first client, maybe 2 weeks to the second).  I was inexperienced and &quot;just wanted to do a good job&quot; and assumed that my contribution had little value and that the clients knew best.<p>Software development is not a handyman service.  Clients can’t just drop someone else into a project and expect it to ever be finished.  So a contractor that can actually deliver is rare and his or her skills are in such demand that clients really don’t have the leverage they think they have.  I think the myth of the ninja programmer stems from this.  An overachieving freelancer that doesn’t charge enough is the holy grail.<p>So in the end, I think the single biggest problem in contracting today is an information deficit on the part of developers.  We forget just how much education we’ve acquired, how few of us are being considered for a contract, how much regular employees are getting paid for similar work, etc.  Even now I am almost pathologically incapable of setting my rates correctly and charging the appropriate amount for the hours I’ve worked.<p>I’ve been thinking lately that we need a set of guidelines that all developers follow, for the good of the whole.  Things like charging half up front, refusing to work for free beyond the hours agreed upon and charging say 75-150% of the going rate for the type of work performed.  Freelancing sites like eLance and oDesk should track these at least as much as, say, how often a developer responds to job invites.  As it stands, I think we are in a race to the bottom and losing our influence day by day until this mobile bubble implodes by decade’s end.<p>In other words, this nonpayment problem shouldn’t have happened in the first place, because our industry has serious issues that older professions have done a better job of addressing.",1412185932

I think it&#x27;s called &quot;Dynamic Flow&quot; or something?

You could insert a new <i>spread</i>, but that may not be what the user wants.<p>In other words, if the user is laying out <i>pages</i>, actual pages matter.

For the frontend, it&#x27;s jquery / d3 for now.\nEverything we do is open source: <a href=""https://github.com/cid-harvard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cid-harvard</a> and we use Github for bug/feature tracking.<p>==================================<p>* Work environment / goals:<p>Coming from the startup world, the work environment is pretty laid back, but everyone is expected to hold their own and get their work done without being micromanaged. No late nights and weekends, although I&#x27;ve been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.<p>We&#x27;re a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher, plus a new super talented designer), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I&#x27;ve been here only for a few months, but I&#x27;ve been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you&#x27;ll have.<p>I&#x27;m looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality. We have great plans and dreams for the future of this site, and we need people to help. We&#x27;d love to hear more about you and see work samples if possible!

8396272,comment,8389731,8391938,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is an interesting take on it. I had a conversation here recently with someone who wanted feminists to call themselves something else (like &quot;equalist&quot;) because &quot;feminist&quot; has a bad reputation. Which, I think is what is happening here, too, only from the other direction: Men saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be called a feminist because I believe people who call themselves &#x27;feminist&#x27; are extremists.&quot;<p>I suspect the bad reputation is primarily caused by bad actors who are actually anti-feminist, and who don&#x27;t want us to continue to move toward equality. 4chan has frequently leaked made up &quot;feminist&quot; rants into the internet at large, right wing Christians very frequently paint an extremely negative view of feminism, etc. There are plenty of people who genuinely oppose gender equality who will say or do anything to stop feminism in its tracks.<p>I used to be squeamish about the term, too. But, then I spent some time reflecting on why. And, the reality is that all the negative connotations I have about feminism (other than the anti-trans so-called &quot;radical feminists&quot; that even feminists make fun of) come from things men who are demonstrably against equality of the sexes have said or done.<p>The feminists I know (and I know a lot of them; I helped start a pro-choice activist organization here in Texas when the bills that are forcing closure of all but six clinics in the entire state were making their way through the state house) are nothing like the picture Republicans paint of them, nor are they anything like the caricature that some redditors and HN participants seem to believe is the reality. I don&#x27;t know where these ideas even come from, honestly. The feminists I know are regular people, who see some injustice in our society and are trying to do something about it. They may occasionally be wrong on the details of execution, but they aren&#x27;t man-hating bitches from hell, and it&#x27;s really counter-productive to take the most extreme examples of anything and decide that the entire movement can be ignored because a few said something obnoxious.<p>To be fair, though, I used to identify as Libertarian. But, the bad apples within that movement seemed to overwhelm the reasonable folks; and there seems to be a movement of extreme right wing nationalists calling themselves &quot;libertarian&quot; lately, which finally put the last nail in the coffin for me. When &quot;libertarian&quot; came to mean &quot;we need paramilitary thugs patrolling our borders to keep those illegals out&quot; to the majority of people, it was time for me to opt out completely from using that label (not to mention the idiotic positions on climate change many self-identified libertarians take). So, I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. I feel as though I&#x27;ve been robbed of an identity by ignorant nationalist racists.

8396263,comment,8394136,8394263,44,0,bane,,,"American here, after age 10, I grew up fairly poor and very rural. Within a half hour drive (on highways) from the home I grew up in, all the jobs were either in farming/agriculture, similar industrial (quarries or steel factory), grocery stores or gas stations.<p>The notion of going to college was virtually inconceivable to me and I was pretty sure I&#x27;d end up out in a field or a factory someplace. For a while I did odd manual labor jobs, sanding decks, cleaning gutters, digging drainage trenches, that sort of thing. My parents were simply unable to pay for any amount of college for me and I was barely making enough money to cover the gas and meals to get to and from and work at the various job sites. Coming out of that kind of environment, with no hope of ever getting to college, I didn&#x27;t even bother taking the SATs in high school and barely graduated at all, nobody hiring farm work cares about your GPA.<p>Through a friend I managed to land a low-end tech job, but it provided me with <i>just</i> enough to pay for community college with lots of financial aid (I couldn&#x27;t take loans because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could even pay them back).<p>Eventually, just <i>because</i> I was currently in college in a desirable field, I landed a paid internship that paid 3x what I was then currently making. I graduated, transferred to the local state school, converted the internship into a part-time job that paid even more.<p>At the local state school, I didn&#x27;t make enough to pay for college and live, so I qualified for a number of grants which provided 100% of my tuition (I still had to pay for books and various other fees). Today the grants are about the same amount of money, but the state school fees back then were about 1/3 less  than they are today thanks to generous subsidies, so I definitely benefited from that subsidy program. I couldn&#x27;t have gone to my final two years of my undergrad in today&#x27;s environment.<p>Because I was nearing the end of my undergrad, I was able to land another, higher paying internship with a performance-based conversion to full-time employment. When I graduated college, I converted to full-time and immediately doubled my income and started on a long and interesting career path.<p>Eventually I went back to grad school and got a Masters, which has again accelerated my career development.<p>So did I experience social mobility from cheap education fees? Absolutely. I think the most important thing is that had I not gone to college and ended up in dead-end farm work, the amount of taxes I would have payed back into the state would have been a tiny tiny fraction of what I&#x27;ve paid back since then. I&#x27;ve easily bought back the subsidies and grants used for my education several times over just in the tax difference that I&#x27;ve paid personally, and the additional economic benefits I&#x27;m able to provide working in my field far outstrip even that. For example, I&#x27;ve been able to hire people from out of state and out of the country and bring them into my state where they&#x27;re now paying taxes back into the system.<p>It seems like such a virtuous cycle that I can&#x27;t imagine why at least the levels of subsidies that I enjoyed haven&#x27;t been maintained. It seems like such an obvious investment.",1412185095

8396251,comment,8394381,8394381,0,0,tolmasky,,,"A story about the initial introduction of computers to the lab my dad worked at, with no particular concrete conclusion:<p>My father is a microbiologist. When he started his postdoc at OHSU, they actually had a information artist <i>guy</i> in the department (apologies, I have no idea what the profession&#x27;s name actually is). When you were writing a paper, you&#x27;d go to the graphics office/dept/whatever and give him your data, which he&#x27;d then lay out in some huge post board or something, then take a picture of it and shrink it down. Clearly much more time consuming than what Excel can accomplish for you now. I think around that same time they were just starting to get computers installed everywhere. By the time my dad left OHSU a few years later, this person was working in the mail room, his profession no longer existed (or at least wasn&#x27;t particularly employable anymore). Everyone was now making their own charts, graphs, visualizations or what-have-you using their computers.<p>I, being a programmer, always thought about this as a success story. Interestingly enough, my dad has a different take on it. His perspective is that he used to be a scientist, now he&#x27;s a scientist and a shitty artist. The way he sees it, its now his responsibility to learn this myriad of tools (photoshop, illustrator, <i>Canvas</i> hehe), whereas before his sole focus was more so on &quot;the science&quot;. I certainly see it on my end, he&#x27;s much better at Photoshop than I am, and at the same time knows a bit of HTML to get by, etc etc. However the reality isn&#x27;t that the time to make these graphics has magically dropped to zero, its just that is become <i>simple enough</i> to not justify having an entire art department handling it, but hard enough to be annoying to him. He certainly spends a lot of time being angry at Photoshop now, which seems to be perfectly acceptable for a professional designer, but a strange consequence of being a scientist. Another result is that you now have someone not trained in data visualization trying to express his findings (vs possibly having someone who has a degree in that making suggestions about how to best present it).<p>Its interesting to try to reconcile these results. Its quite possible that there is no lesson here and its simply a spectrum of trade offs, no perfect scenario. Certainly everyone agrees Microsoft Word is a clear net positive, maybe visualization is just less of a win. Or maybe this is just because we are in an intermediate step, at some point things will be <i>so easy</i> that you 1) don&#x27;t need a separate department, 2) it takes almost no time and 3) it inspires you to create really good visualizations without having much background in that. Who knows.<p>On the other hand some people would argue that this is actually displaying a deeper educational problem, where if there was more interdisciplinary teaching, then every scientist would have some grasp of data visualization and then its just a matter of having a better Photoshop. As time goes on I become more and more skeptical of this approach however. It seems strange to &quot;empower&quot; people when you are actually burdening them with additional responsibility. Since you <i>can</i> do everything yourself, it now becomes &quot;your fault&quot; for not being good at everything.",1412185021

8396207,comment,8394136,8395452,1,0,tomp,,,"> but I can certainly provide some more anecdotal evidence of many people who study for free (in the Czech Republic) and are basically wasting the system resources (both in terms of taking up spaces in classes and having the tax status of a student).<p>That&#x27;s more of an anecdotal evidence of a shitty public university system. I don&#x27;t know how it works in the Czech Republic other than from your comment, but in Slovenia, it&#x27;s extremely wasteful, even though it doesn&#x27;t need to be.<p>The primary issue is that students have awesome tax and other financial benefits. First, you don&#x27;t pay tax for (I&#x27;m not completely sure, but lets say) more than the minimum wage as a student. Then, you get subsidized food (lunch coupons), free healthcare (as long as one of your parents is employed) and lots of benefits with private companies (I had a bank card that allowed me free withdrawals anywhere in the EU, even in a different currency). Personally, I don&#x27;t see an issue with free healthcare (I think it should be free for everyone, as it is in the UK), but tax breaks and lunches are a unnecessary benefit.<p>This issue is exploited by &quot;perpetual students&quot; - basically, there is no incentive, nor requirement, that you finish your studies &quot;in time&quot;. The only limit is that you can have the student status until you&#x27;re 26 years old, so many people stretch their studies beyond what&#x27;s necessary and work for private businesses, gaining experience and not being taxed, for several years before they complete the last exams and graduate. (Then they complain that they can&#x27;t get a job, because all the businesses prefer to hire students, because they&#x27;re cheaper).<p>If education was free, but you were required to finish on time and there were no tax benefits of being a student, the system would waste much less money. To reduce the cost even more, the government could automatically give you a &quot;nominal loan&quot; that was automatically canceled when you finish your study, so only people who study and don&#x27;t finish would have to pay, and you&#x27;d also have to pay for any additional years you need (e.g. if you fail a year).",1412184758

Which mechanism should be used for dynamic dispatch? If you have 10s of types possible at one dispatch but only two seen in practice, the tracing JIT will only compile the fast paths with an exit for the other paths.

The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek.<p>I previously co-founded BuildASign.com, a bootstrapped custom printing ecommerce business set to do over $70M in 2014 revenues, and I left daily operations several years back to study biology, bioinformatics, machine learning and drug discovery. My co-founder, Chris, and I started Recursion to turn drug discovery into a computational problem. Our vision is ambitious (zero-to-one scale), and early results are compelling.<p>>> Lead Data Scientist (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems using lots of data, preferably using python’s scientific stack. You see the world through the lens of statistics and modeling, you thoroughly understand cross-validation and learning curves, and you can explore data on your own and get an effective guess as to what sort of model and assumptions make sense as a starting point.<p>- You’re motivated both by tackling the most challenging data problems around, and by making lots of patients’ lives dramatically better.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of experiments. You’ll set the groundwork for how we’ll design and analyze thousands of experiments in the coming years.<p>>> Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>>> About Recursion:<p>We work in a beautiful office and lab space set directly at the base of the mountains, overlooking Salt Lake City, situated directly one floor above the drug discovery core at the University of Utah, giving us direct access to millions of dollars of cutting edge lab automation and imaging equipment. We offer competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (working at the office is part of the deal), equity, a location 30 minutes from amazing mountains and 5 world-class ski resorts, and a group of ambitious, talented, happy, awesome people to work with.<p><a href=""http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.recursionpharma.com/lead-python-data-scientist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recursionpharma.com/lead-python-data-scientist.ht...</a>",1412184536

Yes. There are a number of scholars of the economics of education who work full-time researching this issue. You are correct that university admission generally takes in young people from more prosperous families all over the world--because young people from such families don&#x27;t have to enter the labor force immediately after completing compulsory schooling to support themselves or to support other family members.<p>The best evidence from international studies suggests the policy announced by Germany is not the best policy for ensuring access to higher education. An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) international study reports, &quot;Student financial support systems that offer loans with income-contingent repayment to all students combined with means-tested grants can be an effective way to promote access and equity while sharing the costs of higher education between the state and students.&quot;[1] Reading this study will provide more background information.<p>My recollection of the international research studies I have read is that the best mix of quality of higher education and access to higher education by students of all economic backgrounds is to have a mixed system (nonsystem) of higher education in a country, with some public universities with very heavy tax subsidies so that list price is low (but admission is hard to gain), some private universities that accept students with more money (or more willingness to take out loans on the idea that investing in higher education has return on investment), and some privately funded scholarships specific to students rather than specific to what institutions the students enroll in. Examples of countries with such nonsystems that produce a lot of access to higher education of good quality for a lot of students include the United States (where black people, who are often poor, attend college at a higher rate than French people in France do, as I recall reading), and more recently Japan (which now also has such a mixed nonsystem, parallel to its national universities), and Taiwan. I have also read the Norway and other Nordic countries do well in providing a lot of access to reasonably good higher education, with perhaps a different mix of providers.<p>A 2013 article from the <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>[2] has an interesting discussion of international trends in financing higher education.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/49729932.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/49729932....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/a-different-world/2001128.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/a-different-w...</a>",1412184111

8396055,comment,8394784,8394784,2,0,nkurz,,,"I like that this article shows the generated assembly for the same source with different compilers, and the same compiler with different optimization levels.   Even with C programmers, there&#x27;s a discouraging trend of treating the compiler&#x27;s decisions as unimpeachable.   Occasionally it does a great job, but if you make a habit of looking at generated code you will quickly realize it&#x27;s anything but ideal.<p>What this article implies, but doesn&#x27;t really concentrate on, is that while one can write portable code that will produce correct results when compiled with different compilers, it&#x27;s very difficult to write code that will have portable performance.  A code construct that produces a 100% speedup with one compiler might just as well yield a 50% slowdown on another.<p>Even in C, optimizing code is largely an act of faith.  One way around this, which I&#x27;m surprised is not more used, is to &quot;lock the code down&quot; to assembly after it is written.   This doesn&#x27;t mean you have to actually write anything in assembly.  Rather, after you finally manage to get a compiler to produce the level of performance you want for the function that most impacts performance, you can extract the generated assembly and paste it into file, leaving your C code for portability to different processors.   Given the stable x64 assembly ABI, you can usually even mix and match between compilers --- try several, and copy the code generated by the one that does best.<p>While this obviously won&#x27;t work for different instruction sets, it works quite well for different generations of processors.   CPU makers are properly concerned about making their new chips faster than the old, and thus do a fairly good job of avoiding regressions in performance.  While there might be a faster method for the new chip, it&#x27;s not that common find that the new chip executes identical code substantially slower.  I&#x27;d usually rather bet on this than on assuming that future generations of the compiler will keep the same magic combination of instructions for the old chip while simultaneously generating new magic for the new chip.",1412183587

The parent was complaining all the zones were restarted AT THE SAME TIME.  Jeff explains why they had to do the maintenance, and nobody is disputing why they had to do it.  What <i>is</i> being disputed is that they did it all at once, without rolling the restarts.  This makes ZERO sense given their advice to &#x27;re-examine your (AWS based) architecture&#x27; for fault tolerance.  Don&#x27;t patronize me while you&#x27;re doing something that affects me in a way I can&#x27;t control.<p>I&#x27;ve had direct experience with AWS in this regard, and was equally disappointed in the outcome.  If you want to see a class act in taking ownership of issues arising from such matters, have a look at Rackspace&#x27;s response:<p><pre><code>  Dear Rackspace Customer,\n\n  I’m writing to apologize for the downtime and inconvenience that you and others of our customers have suffered in recent days.  Like other major cloud providers, we were forced to reboot some of our customers’ servers to patch a security vulnerability affecting certain versions of XenServer, a popular open-source hypervisor.  This maintenance was especially difficult for many of you because it had to be performed on short notice, and over the weekend.\n\n  Now that this issue has been fully remediated, without any reports of compromised data among our customers, I’d like to explain what happened, and why.\n\n  Whenever we at Rackspace become aware of a security vulnerability, whether in our systems or (as in this case) in third-party software, we face a balancing act.  We want to be as transparent as possible with you, our customers, so you can join us in taking actions to secure your data.  But we don’t want to advertise the vulnerability before it’s fixed — lest we, in effect, ring a dinner bell for the world’s cyber criminals.\n\n  That’s the dilemma that we faced over the Xen bug. Such vulnerabilities are regularly found in software, whether proprietary or open source. The key, once a bug is identified, is to fix it swiftly and quietly.  This particular vulnerability could have allowed bad actors who followed a certain series of memory commands to read snippets of data belonging to other customers, or to crash the host server. We wanted to flag the issue as quickly as possible to those of you using our Standard, Performance 1, and Performance 2 Cloud Servers, and our Hadoop Cloud Big Data service.  But we didn’t want to do so until we had a software patch in place to address the vulnerability.\n\n  When we learned of the security issue and realized its significance early last week, our engineers worked with our Xen partners to develop and test a patch, and organize a reboot plan.  The patch wasn’t ready until the evening of Friday, Sept. 26.  And the technical details of the vulnerability were scheduled to be publicly released on Wednesday, Oct. 1.  We were faced with the difficult decision of whether to start our reboots over the weekend, with short notice to our customers, or postpone it until Monday. The latter course would not allow us to sufficiently stagger the reboots.  It would jeopardize our ability to fully patch all the affected servers before the vulnerability became public, thus exposing our customers to heightened risk.\n\n  We decided the lesser evil was to proceed immediately, at which time we notified you, and our partners in the Xen community, of the need for an urgent server reboot.  Even then, to avoid alerting cyber criminals, we didn’t mention Xen as the reason for the reboot. Another major cloud provider did attribute its reboot to security problems with Xen, which put all users of the affected versions of that hypervisor at heightened risk.  But we’re relieved to report that, as of now, we’ve learned of no data compromise among Rackspace customers.  Now that the vulnerability has been fully remediated, the Xen community has lifted its embargo on talking about it.\n\n  Those of you who are longtime Rackspace customers know that we have a strong record of open, timely communication with you. We reach out to you whenever there’s an issue.  We answer the phone whenever you call. We do everything we can to find a solution.  This past weekend, our engineers worked tirelessly with customers and partners to remediate the Xen vulnerability.  \n\n  This maintenance affected nearly a quarter of our 200,000-plus customers, and in the course of it, we dropped a few balls.  Some of our reboots, for example, took much longer than they should.  And some of our notifications were not as clear as they should have been. We are making changes to address those mistakes.  And we welcome your feedback on how we can better serve you.\n\n  As a veteran Racker who is proud of our commitment to our customers and their businesses, I am personally sorry for any inconvenience or downtime that we caused you during this incident.\n\n  Sincerely, \n\n  Taylor Rhodes\n  CEO and President\n  Rackspace\n\n  taylor.rhodes@rackspace.com</code></pre>",1412183068

Instead they took them to a beautiful country mansion, and plied them with magnificent meals and drink, and allowed them to listen to German radio and read newspapers to keep up to date on the war. Each had his own room and a batman, and were treated like senior officers in the British Army.<p>Of course, the officers had much to talk about to each other, but unknown to them, the Brits had wired the entire mansion and had a team of intelligence officers working in the basement.<p>The intelligence they got was far more effective than pulling finger nails. They learnt a huge amount about the relationships between senior commanders and with Hitler. They also learnt a lot about German military strategy and tactics ... From the top.\nNow that&#x27;s intelligence.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1412182892

377403,comment,377347,377347,0,0,patio11,,,"Submitter here.  Glad you liked the story.<p>Incidentally, I am a Prosper lender to the tune of $300.  The dirt on this story could fill a small book, or a large forum (<a href=""http://www.prospers.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prospers.org</a>)<p>The long and short of it: Prosper really wanted to be a technology play like Paypal which disintermediated banks and then got to take a small slice off each transaction.  However, their model required that they, in effect, take on a lot of banklike aspects -- including investigating borrowers and collecting on deadbeats.  They were woefully unprepared for both of them, thinking at the beginning that the lending peers would crowdsource it, before they realized that this would be very, very illegal.<p>(Privacy/harassment laws + telling 50 pissed people the identity of a single mom late on her payments + Google + lawyer = you tell me how this story ends.)<p>Anyhow, Prosper expected that despite the complete lack underwriting and neigh-total lack of fraud checking they would get default rates roughly similar to that of banks.  Then, BEFORE the financial crisis started, reality set in and lenders started losing lots of money.  This made Prosper's claimed rates of return (""Hey, if you loan money at 20% and only 5% default that means you make 15% APR!""[1]) extraordinarily rosy.  Rather than accepting the data and revising the claimed rates of return downward, they instead started slicing it in smaller and smaller pieces (creating, for example, a Prosper Select Index filled with their best quality borrowers -- are we hearing the word ""tranches"" yet?) to claim that the rate was still exceptionally positive.<p>Representative ad:<p>[Edit: Thank you to commenter who pointed out my URL was borked.  I'll TinyURL it: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/63em2c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/63em2c</a> ]<p>Funny, ""Earn 8.00% to 12.00% rates of return"" looks like a security, it sounds like a security, it feels like a security... except if it were an actual security, well, the accountant who approved those numbers would be locked up.  (Seriously.  I <i>liked</i> the company, but the math is THAT bad.  The average rate of return lenders of size were actually achieving was, at the time, closer to 3%.  About 25% were losing money.  Only about 10% every achieved the rates that were claimed in 36 pt font.  And for what its worth, although my $300 doesn't make me a large lender by any stretch of the imagination, up until my first late payment a few weeks ago I was earning close to 18%.)<p>[1] Despite two years of trying to educate them about how math works via their forum and their email, we lenders were unable to penetrate their ignorance about high school math.  Seriously.  Three years after opening they still thought 25% interest and 20% defaults meant a 5% return.  Even if the defaults were almost instantaneous, as most defaults on the platform are.",1227685906

Because of the profit motives, loans on Prosper qualified as securities, and hence the SEC regulations applied.

377389,comment,377290,377290,0,0,makecheck,,,"It's not realistic in my opinion for interviewers to throw complex problems at people and expect to draw useful conclusions.  For one thing, truly challenging problems are generally solved in teams.  And there are plenty of differences between pure math and how computers do it (think of an entire course on numerical analysis).<p>Interviewers should find out how well candidates might work in teams, how familiar they are with debugging on a computer, and how likely it is their ""cleverness"" won't result in a steaming pile of unmaintainable code.  There are lots of reasons why someone may make it or not make it through a puzzle, and either way they may be an excellent candidate.<p>What should occur is a reasonable bridge between abstract problem-solving and programming, to see if the candidate's aptitudes are strong where it counts.  For example, numerical analysis is great: you could ask someone how they would <i>make a machine</i> perform a certain calculation expressed in ""pure"" math.  (Does everyone know how to factor equations to minimize expensive instructions?  Do all candidates realize the inherent quirks in things like the representation of floating-point numbers?  This is the kind of stuff that comes up when math meets computers.)",1227684977

The pattern of the child who turns out to be magic, or the loner who becomes a hero: these are archetypes that touch something deep in human beings. Sure there can be an egotistical - I'm using a less vivid word than yours :) - element to how we identify with heroes. But I think on a deeper level, it is a universal experience and not an egotistical one.<p>Take for example The Matrix - I really liked that movie when it came out, and part of what I enjoyed was the story of Neo turning out to be The One, and I certainly identified with that character. But so did everybody else who enjoyed the movie. If it were pure egotism, the enjoyment wouldn't be shared. Instead, you'd get arguments like ""I'm Neo!"" -- ""No you're not, I am!"" That doesn't happen with the best of these stories.",1227684604

I'm a working person, so I have to shell out the money, while some schmuck that lost his job can have fun without paying. But I guess that's what you get when you sell ""software"". You can price it and license it however you want because it costs nothing to copy.",1238845959

546264,comment,546147,546147,0,0,triplefox,,,"Signs are accumulating that the industry is going to shift towards lower-budget projects because the blockbuster-centric model has become unsustainable on multiple levels - cost+time risks, a uncertain future consumer market, technology hitting a plateau of diminishing returns, and, of course, growth in online+downloadable. With lower budgets, the projects are less sexy, but also have less room for catastrophes, crunch included.<p>I believe that this kind of future environment is more likely to encourage sustainable practices. Studios working consoles and retail are traditionally forced towards heavy turnover because the market economics dictate it. But in a low budget and predominantly online market, a small studio suddenly has a lot of room to make an impact on their own, without leverage.<p>Most studios really do want to hang on to their people, and this coming decade may be when that becomes the norm.",1238843782

Perhaps something about trigger-happy taser cops, the TSA, or ever-growing prison population. Besides, as I said before, what applies to the countries you mention does not apply to all European nations. \nHow about this: I have two gay couples in my direct family that got married some years ago. Not 'civil union' or any of that stuff, but full on marriage, with the same rights as male-female couples. Or this: my ageing mother has determined she will want to have euthanasia under certain circumstances, and she will be able to, as it's been legal for years. Difficult for me to swallow, but it is her freedom to choose this. Another one: cannabis use - decriminalized. Have you got those freedoms in the US?<p>Let me be more explicit about my point: I posit that no nation on earth has the perfect legal system (not even the one with the constitution they are so proud of). Europe, with its right of free movement between nations for all European citizens, offers a unique advantage in that it allows citizens to shop around for the place that fits them best. Competition works - it made life on Earth possible, it makes capitalism work, and it keeps the nations of Europe in check.",1238843116

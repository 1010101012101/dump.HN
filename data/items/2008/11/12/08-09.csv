The owner made his case that the machine did everything he needed just how he liked it so he was going to keep his machine locked down and unchanged. Hard to argue against that as it is exactly the sort of line a great many corporates take - get it working then leave it alone.<p>Why bring this ""Luddite"" up? Well he is an active participant in a number of web communities plus does a fair bit of web shopping - he is certainly not the sort of user I would want to exclude from my sites. He will ""upgrade"" one day when his current PC dies but that could be a while yet.",1226480274

Imaginary numbers are fun to pay off, but no fun to receive :)<p>Also: perhaps the model was built up using empirical data and they just never really had a chance to update the model when home prices were going down... I don't find it all that weird for them to produce data-driven forecasts ;)",1226480172

361620,comment,361576,361578,0,0,tomsaffell,,,">by the time you start seeing articles like this, chances are you're late already<p>I disagree on two counts:<p>1. The market has seen no significant <i>net</i> increase in price, and is down significantly on recent (12 month) highs. So one may be <i>early</i> for this cycle (or at bottom). Alternatively, one may be <i>late</i> in the sense that there will be no further investment opportunities <i>ever</i> in the future, and that one would have needed to invest during a previous cycle:)<p>(This is see as <i>evidence</i> that it is not too late)<p>2. Markets act on fear and greed. As Buffett said, be ""be greedy when others are fearful"". Sentiment changes slowly, and heterogeneously (by which I mean different investors change their sentiment at different times and speeds). My observation is that most people are still fearful, but some are not, and the author of this article (and Buffett) are two such examples. So the logic ""one person calls 'buy' -> no opportunity"" does not hold for me. Now, if many (>=50%) are calling 'buy' then it is time to be fearful.. (This I see as <i>rationale</i> for why your statement isn't true, but not evidence)",1226479976

These are people who will either ignore me if I ask them to get a new browser or will never come back.<p>Look guys, there are reasons that people don't upgrade, some good some bad. The other day a friend's 386 died, and with it all these Lotus 123 documents, now, do I berate them for using obsolete software or attempt to get them back on their feet?<p>(And yes, it is annoying to support IE6 and I have burned development time doing so. Mostly its ""kind of okay"" though, since I haven't run into anything too serious.)",1226479868

They use 'MVC' as structure for there code (or as you call it: prescriptive). And then suddenly a lightweight framework is not that lightweight anymore. So again I agree with your descriptions of the web as MVC, but MVC in a PHP framework only... I still believe that's just a hype word.<p>BTW I don't want to start a flame war about MVC. I just got some question marks about using a PHP 'MVC' framework.",1269259036

The result here is a message that helps neither users nor developers understand what went wrong or how to fix it. A message such as ""fault in module Foo @ address 0x921851"" or somesuch would be no more incomprehensible to the average user than this and a message such as ""something went wrong, oh noes!"" would be no more useless to developers.

Being a startup, it's likely that many heads will have many hats; to mix metaphors just make sure all the bases are covered.<p>Drilling down, as ""CTO"" I'd consider myself responsible for making sure of all the following (needless to say, this isn't an exaustive list):<p>Business continuity: if you're the only one diligent enough to make sure you're backups are happening and work, do it (in the bad old days that meant running the tape backup every day).  Never be too proud to sweep the floor.<p>As CTO, you're responsible for ""what"": the architecture and consistency of your systems.  Visit the Joel Test and do it in reverse.<p>Depending on the people below you, you can leave a lot of the ""how"" to them, ideally you'll mostly supervise there.  Ideally they'll come to consensus on contentious issues, beware of playing the role of a tiebreaker.<p>Ah, yes, the people: learn how to recruit well.  There's lots of good advice to be found there (e.g. go to the Ask the Headhunter site and use it in reverse).  For specific advice, I'll note that one of my best bosses would never hire someone who he had doubts about.  In a startup, it's generally the case that a wrong hire is worse than no hire at all.<p>Sales, marketing, manufacturing (if that's an issue) and technical coherence.  Make sure everyone is on the same page.  That's one of the things that killed Symbolics, e.g. they spent a lot of money on a factory that couldn't make what engineering was designing, not that marketing was promoting what engineering was designing or the reverse.<p>Make sure there's a product manager for each product, his job is among other things to help make sure the above is happening.<p>Good luck!",1269258890

Today we have precious little of this liberty already (I suspect that you imagine that square 1, the present situation, is some sort of laissez faire free for all market economy, but that couldn't be further from the truth), tomorrow we will have even less.<p>Given that the US has been the engine of medical advancements in the world for the past several decades (though you'd expect the EU, with a similar population and wealth to at least match America's contributions), it seems that perhaps there is some correlation between the ability to earn a profit on the sale of new drugs and new treatments and the development of those treatments.<p>Now, indeed, this correlation seems to hold in every other industry as well, and everyone accepts that. We understand that Apple would not spend its efforts developing the iPad were it not assured of a hefty profit. We understand that Tesla motors would not have poured the significant amount of R&D into developing their roadster if they did not expect to make significantly more in sales.<p>And yet somehow our reason flies out the window when it comes to medical care, because we can't imagine the ""unfairness"" of a system which doesn't cover everyone exactly 100% equally. Sad to say but the universe is unfair. I believe that it's important that we ensure that life-saving care is always available to people regardless of whether they are able to pay or not, but I do not believe that medical care can or should be ""free"" or entirely government subsidized for everyone.<p>That path is the way not only to the stagnation of medical advances but also to the ultimate bureaucratization of the medical industry. We can look forward to more and more people deciding to become software developers, lawyers, or oil and gas engineers instead of doctors, nurses, or pharmaceutical researchers. And we can look forward to a system ever more encumbered by red tape and the inefficiency of bureaucracy at every step. In what fantasy world could anyone imagine that the results will be any different?<p>We should rejoice that it's even remotely possible to trade dollars for health. We should thank all of the people who spent so much effort going through medical school, nursing school, or acquiring chemistry degrees, and who spend so much effort keeping up with the state of the industry. If instead we vilify these folks as extortionists and financial nuisances, if we portray them as providing services that we DESERVE to receive as a birth right for a pittance, then we will drive them away.

This made a lot of sense when executable sizes were critical. Install the CRT once, and any app can use it. The MS approved solution as I understand it is to bundle the CRT installer in your own installer. This of course makes no sense if you have no installer. So it's a better idea to statically link the CRT and not worry about what your users have.",1269256911

1210014,story,,,19,24,fezzl,"Ask HN: Is artificial intelligence/natural language processing a futile pursuit?",,"Hi. I am a sophomore with a start-up that builds sentiment analysis technologies. We currently work on sentiment summarization and classification. Using papers and patents as a starting point, we try to create our own algorithm that we hope will outperform state-of-the-art approaches. We have been working on it for the past 2 months. Call it an irrational mindset, but we're adamant on building something that is not only tedious to copy but also fundamentally hard to duplicate.<p>We have concerns regarding what we are doing, namely: technology and market risks.<p>1) Technology risk\nWe are worried that we would hit a dead-end and not be able to build what we set out to build. AI is a hard technical problem, and Marc Andreessen has described AI as an ""equivalent"" of rocket science. We are making progress but our chances of technologically outperforming Google or other AI-based companies are inherently not good. We fear that we might have picked the wrong beast to mess with but we're a little too involved right now to switch paths.<p>2) Market risk\nOther than social media monitoring tools, I haven't come across any solution that deals with sentiment analytics. The social media monitoring scene is crowded, so we hope to apply what we build in other unexplored areas. Our vision for now is to tackle the problem of information overload <i>within</i> consumer review platforms: think Amazon reviews, Yelp reviews, IMDb reviews, etc. We hope to offer an on-site (within-the-page-itself) dashboard that categorises raw data by mentioned concepts and their frequencies, the sentiments (positive/negative) with regard to said concepts and selected quotes that incorporate said aspects, along with sentiment insights in visualised forms (e.g. pie charts). End-users can interact with the dashboard and use any variable as an anchor to obtain insights (e.g. give me the raw data that mention concepts 1 and 2 in a positive light). This, we hope, would help people consume content more representatively and faster, without having to read through every single review from top-left to bottom-right. Hopefully, this would increase user engagement and shorten sales cycles. Naturally, the fear is that nobody wants our product, much less pay for it. Personally, as an end-user, I would find something like that useful, but I'm obviously biased.<p>Looking forward to some input for my current situation.",1269256519

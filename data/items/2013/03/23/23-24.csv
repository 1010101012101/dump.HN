Did Steve Jobs receive a letter once his net worth passed a certain threshold inviting him to join the various ""protect the rich"" conspiracies?  How about Bill Gates or the many other rich folk?

What would happen if teachers were not unionized and had to compete for their jobs?  What would happen if teachers lived in a true meritocracy without a sure protections?  What would happen if teachers had to have advanced degrees and even some real world experience before being able to teach?  I'm sure this would not all the problems, but, what would happen?

Finding out what learning environment, inside or outside school, is optimal for each learner is definitely a worthy goal, especially if means are then provided to obtain that environment. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>so I'm always glad to discuss how to improve opportunities for learners with other participants here. I have seen some examples of helpful reforms where I live. Minnesota, where I now live and where I grew up, has had largely equal per-capita funding for public school pupils statewide since the 1970s. The state law change that made most school funding come from general state appropriations rather than from local property taxes was called the ""Minnesota miracle.""<p><a href=""http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.htm...</a><p>Today most funding for schools is distributed by the state government on a per-pupil enrollment basis.<p><a href=""http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html</a><p>The funding reform in the 1970s was followed up by two futher reforms in the 1980s. First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state's dime.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>So Linus notes, in the article submitted here, that where he lives in Oregon, ""And now, in the name of fairness, there's a bill (HB 2748) getting pushed through to make that kind of 'out-of-district tuition student' not be an option any more."" That's crazy, because Minnesota's pattern of open enrollment has shown that every school district gains by enrolling as many students as it can attract, given the funding pattern here. Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states. That gets closer to the ideal of detect the optimum education environment for each student (by parents observing what works for each of their differing children) and give it to them by open-enrolling in another school district (my school district has inbound open-enrollment students from forty-one other school districts of residence) or by homeschooling, or by postsecondary study at high school age, or by exercising other choices.<p>The educational results of Minnesota schools are well above the meager results of most United States schools, and almost competitive (but not fully competitive) with the better schools in the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia. It's a start. More choices would be even better.<p>To achieve the worthy goal mentioned in the article submitted here involves changing the incentives now operating in the school system in most countries, both as to direct regulations and as to funding. Schools should be eager to enroll new students, as a demonstration that the school is meeting learner needs, and then the schools should be rewarded for doing so.",1364080655

Just as a programmer I've worked with and  for folks who have graduated from such juggernauts as Northwestern Oklahoma State, Southeast Missouri, San Jose State, and a host of other non-premier colleges. Not to mention the huge number of folks from public schools of various orders.<p>I myself attended from Central Arkansas, and have had no issue getting a good job. My wife's experience in her field has been much the same.<p>Now that doesn't mean the playing field is completely fair. As an entrepreneur I've been frustrated by the advantages kids coming out of the top-tier schools have. This is especially true in anything related to finance. Those schools are a ticket into that world, and it's a really amazing advantage. Both in terms of landing extremely high paying jobs (fund managers and the like) and in terms of raising money. It's much easier to fund raise when you come with that sort of credibility and direct connection to those who have a lot of money.<p>Still, lets not confuse matters here. People from lower tier schools make it, and make it big, all the time. The system isn't rigged, it's remarkably fair. I worked hard to become very good at what I do. I put myself in a position to learn and experience a big win. That's given me the credibility I need to start to enjoy some of those advantages as well.<p>Lots of others have done the same thing.<p>So I reject the premise of your statement. Although I largely disagree with the notion that education is in crisis. There are certainly <i>areas</i> of crisis, but those cultures seem cultural and not institutional. Studies have shown that the vast majority of our kids are competitive on the world level.

I generally only meet two kinds of academics: the perpetually tired (like myself) and the perpetually energetic.  This may have something to do with the ways our bodies metabolize the utterly ubiquitous, universal stimulants (ie: loads and loads of caffeine) we take to cope with our relatively long working hours (it's not that unusual, for myself as a grad student or for many professors I've met, to start the day at 9:30am and finally leave for home at 7:30pm, then still be answering emails and doing work at home until it's time to sleep).<p>I'm perpetually tired because I keep developing a tolerance for the stuff every time I find a stronger coffee, and the habit of Israeli institutions is to start early in the morning, so I keep having to override my natural sleep rhythm with coffee -- thus requiring me to find ever-stronger caffeine sources even though what I <i>really</i> need is to just wake up somewhere from 8:30-9am and have one cup of black tea.<p><i>The moral lesson (and it applies to us as programmers, too) is that teaching (for us, documentation and outreach) isn't commodity grunt work. It's vital. It's often where most of the value is added. If you blow teaching off, the world will lose interest in you and pull investment. I would say ""you deserve it"" but, in the academic sphere, it's a different (younger) set of people getting whacked for it.</i><p>Hmmm....  I semi-object.  It's not that teaching is unimportant, but that the whole dichotomy is really a spectrum.  There's undergraduate-level teaching, graduate-level teaching, colleague-level teaching, documented research (ie: publishing), and your own research notes.  The institutional problem is that you need a full spectrum of different methods and expectations for each role.<p>It's easy to say that we need to emphasize research less and undergrad teaching more, but what's really happened is that an originally unified role (the Full Professor of teaching and research) has grown apart, as the research frontier, and even the grad-level teaching frontiers taught to MSc and PhD students, pull steadily further and further away from the capacity of the undergraduate curriculum.<p>IMNSHO, we need to have a lot more respect for teachers, but we also just need to eliminate middle school.  Ok, now that I have your attention: the skill level required to do Real Work, in both industry and research, has gone up, so we need to find ways to stop wasting our youth's time in redundant so-called education they neither want nor need and get them properly specialized and skilled once they show some talent and direction instead of just expecting to pump out Yet Another 1000 Engineering Grads.",1364080161

I never would have believed that my unfinished Photoshop layout mockups would one day become a design trend and be sold off as ""flat design"". Where the design is simpler, cleaner, easier for the designer to produce, and charges the same amount of money to the client. It's basically selling less to the client at the same cost and creating an easier experience for the users. I'm not complaining, it's just interesting how design works.<p>These sites are beautiful.

(The term ""corporation"" wouldn't have been used in quite its modern sense during his lifetime.)<p>There <i>is</i> a similar quote by Jefferson that speaks about banking <i>establishments</i> being more dangerous than standing armies, but the term ""establishment"" there isn't a synonym for ""institution"" - think about what ""establishment"" meant with respect to religion in his era - and the position that I interpret here was one that could be described as somewhat aligned with his position on religion: that there ought to be a sort of ""wall of separation"" between the financial economy and the state in parallel to the wall between church and state.  In other words, Jefferson is arguing against the politicization of banking, not banks themselves, which seems a strongly free-market position, and somewhat contrary to what you appear to imply.",1364079759

It's a visceral level of rage that I find remarkable since that's not how I generally respond to in-app ads.<p>They're just so very very wrong in this context, mainly because they're deliberately distracting. For someone trying to focus on delivering a presentation, this is 100% unacceptable. It would be tolerable (barely) if the ad never changed, but when the damn thing changes every few seconds, it's more than enough to break one's concentration. And that is LETHAL for public speaking.<p>I know HN guidelines discourage the use of caps for emphasis, and I almost never use them for this reason. But my negative reaction was SO strong that it's worth breaking protocol just to emphasize how awful those intrusions really are.<p>Aside from that one hideous, terrible, awful, repulsive, glaring deal-killer of a flaw, this app is brilliant.

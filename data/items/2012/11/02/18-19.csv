4734206,comment,4733972,4733972,24,0,dquigley,,,"Clay Christensen in the Innovators Solution lays out an explanation for what is happening here. Apple used vertical integration to make a giant leap forward with their iPhone that you couldn't have made in a non-integrated company. They ended up overshooting the typical consumer's needs though in the following iterations of the iPhone. And the technology that was at first difficult for competitors to reproduce became easier to replicate (thanks in part to Android). Samsung, HTC, and others were able then to provide good enough devices (and in certain ways, better devices) to consumers at a lower price point.<p>Apple's response has been to move up market towards tablets, and have been able to use their vertical integration to produce devices that no other Android manufacturer could match at first. Microsoft is building their own device to have similar quality, but they are doing it as a vertically integrated company. Amazon showed you could do a partial vertical integration (heavily customized Android and integration into their own media resources) to take away the low end of the tablet market from Apple. And slowly the Android tablet manufacturers are catching up to Apple.<p>So what this makes me ask is what will be next for Apple? They haven't been good at playing the high-volume, low-profit electronics game, so they'll need another ""blockbuster"", highly innovative device, and I am excited to see what that will be. It drives the industry forward, and creates exciting new technology we all get to benefit from eventually.",1351882796

4734204,comment,4731749,4733781,3,0,Groxx,,,"Yes.<p>Light from source A travels at the speed determined by the last speed-wavefront that passed it.  This can be modeled by storing the speed on the sources, or by calculating from all gathered orbs in the world, and selecting the most-recent, when the time is calculated by (<time picked up> at <distance when picked up> at <speed of light before picked up>).<p>All such waves will be entirely contained within the previous wave because you cannot go faster than light and the speed only decreases, so all that matters is the speed before it was picked up, which is the speed the wave-front moves at (or does it move at the new speed?  eh, pick either one, it doesn't matter.)<p>Then, for each orb picked up since the most-recent that affected the source, the time for the light to reach the observer is based on <distance to orb N> at speed <before orb N> until <distance to orb N-1>.  Then repeat for orb N-1 until you run out of orbs.  In this case, N would be the oldest orb whose wavefront has not yet passed the source.<p>It's a piece-wise calculation (the reverse of what's described), so it would be slower than instantaneous changes, but there's no need to model photons.  And I would guess there's a reasonably-efficient way to calculate this on a GPU, so it could probably be real-time.  Or it will be in a year or two.",1351882760

4734136,comment,4732924,4732924,5,0,webjprgm,,,"The ""callback hell"" example is a rather tame one, since the code is readable in a single location just with some nesting.  So when I see the FRP solution which is the same amount of code I'm not certain that in a complex example this actually solves the problem.  You can still have lift statements scattered around a program just like you can have callbacks to various functions scattered around.<p>The solution to GOTO was to remove it and replace it with a few control structure forms that enforced locality.  I remember converting someone's GOTO-laced code once and basically everything could be re-written with some clever use of do-while with break statements and an occasional flag variable.  do-while, while, for, etc. replace GOTO in 99% of cases and enforce the desired code locality for readability.<p>So what syntactical structure could enforce locality of time-connected variables?<p>E.g. some idea like this:<p><pre><code>    data, err <- $.ajax(requestUrl1)\n    if( err ) {\n      console.log(err)\n      return\n    }\n    data2, err <- $.ajax(makeRequestUrl2(data))\n</code></pre>\nWhere the <- syntax could be like an = statement but say that the assignment and all following statements are placed in a callback.",1351882019

Whether networks have sufficient coverage is another question entirely, and LTE on different frequencies can have severe penetration issues which can negatively impact your signal strength and download/upload speeds. Still, the numbers reported in that Verge article are pretty depressing and speak less to LTE as a technology and more to the poor situation that US mobile networks are in.<p>Thus: If you are targeting a purely US audience, then LTE might not make sense, but if you're selling to people outside of the US's broken mobile situation, LTE is a huge boost.",1351881179

But I think the article talks  about how intentional staying away from 'thinking big' doesn't prevent your product from becoming big - eventually, which is a different thing. Article doesn't try to explain why that is the case, actually, and reads more like a statement of an important fact with some prominent examples. And we know that there are examples to everything.<p>Also, it is easy to mistake 'starting small and growing big overtime' for 'starting small and staying small, but having a great impact on whatever side of life/business we choose' - kind of what folks from 37signals do (an example, yes).<p>That said, I think this is a very good advise: applied right and regularly, it helps you escape the procrastination period (uncertainty of 'big' may be too strong to overcome), skip needless research and preparations, avoid paralysis by analysis and other friends of 'thinking big'. The next logical step is reducing 'start something small' to just 'start something'.",1351880993

4733985,story,,,5,6,vasek,"Ask HN: Career help/advice",,"I realize that everyone makes their own decisions and it's difficult to compare, without knowing details, but I can't think of a better place to ask for advice.<p>I am 35 and have been doing IT/Ops(devops)/Security for close to 20 years. I've done management (small teams), but I am much better (and comfortable) with hands on and dealing directly with technology/design. I now have a choice of two companies:<p>A - a larger company, ~1000 people. Grew rapidly over the last year(maybe too much), since they got bought out. The culture is very much ""startup-like"". Biggest in their market with 10s of millions of users. Relatively well known, even to someone who is not using their product and googling will quickly let people find out. Offering the most money and want me in a technical/strategic role (non-manager, at least at first). There are some very interesting problems to solve (scale & complexity) and they have a lot of brilliant people, which is a huge attraction. The downside is really being a medium fish in a big pond and the impact that I'll be able to make there is probably more limited.<p>B - is a small (profitable) startup, probably <50 people. They are growing, but at best they are 3-4th in the market, behind a few 800lb gorillas. The role is still very much hands-on technical, but leading a team in addition to that. I can write in whatever fancy title I want. The problems they want to solve are interesting, but much more narrow in scope. The compensation model is heavy on bonuses/incentives/revenue goals and upside is potentially higher. Name recognition isn't quite as high, though people do know them.<p>So, it's a two-part question:<p>1. Career-wise, is it better to be in a smaller company with a big title or a larger company with a less impressive one? \n2. Most of my time has been spent in smaller shops, where I am usually the most experienced/expert guy. How is it working for a large company with a lot of talented people?",1351880097

To me, both of your ideas really are worthless (no offence). I wouldn't be inclined to pay for either of them, and do not really have an interest in working on either. That said, the market is vast. If you can find someone to pay you for the idea then I will agree that the idea may have value.<p>The problem at this stage is that without any execution on those ideas, both are equally likely to fail. For all we know the market for pachyderm telephones is large and nobody wants SMS downtime messages. There has been no market research done at the point of idea conception. Doing so leads into execution, where the value is generally thought to be created.<p>The other problem is that everyone with skills to build such ideas already have a million of their own. Most wouldn't even consider buying an idea from someone else. If the chances of failure is high, at least you are working on your own failure and not someone else's. That is why ideas are generally considered worthless.",1351879474

Take as an example an issue tracker. You can start as small as you like (a file with a list of issues to deal with) and go towards a reasonable solution.<p>The problem is not every single problem in the world can be broken down into such pieces. Take for example a fashionable electric car from Tesla. There is no reasonable way how you can start an electric car from a gasoline car (put an extra electrict motor? you end up with hybrid. take away the gasoline motor? you end up with a horse cart) and tesla did not even have a gasoline car to start with.<p>There are both kinds of problem and I agree most startups, especially in the social world can be implemented in gradual steps that make sense. The problem with other problems is that first you have to understand the problem area really well. A very good start is to try the gradual way and <i></i>fail<i></i> at it, later to start a leapfrog approach, knowing the problem area.<p>My 2 cents.",1351879426

You can't just take one example (Sparrow) and then claim the whole traditional ecosystem of software doesn't work. <i>Of course it does</i>.<p>- This is professional stuff used to build businesses on. Already it's quite risky to use this new tech made by a third party startup and invest hundres of hours of developer time to build an app. If something goes wrong in the future, for example Apple forbids RubyMotion apps, your investment (not in cost of RubyMotion but in the cost of developers which is obviously orders of magnitude higher) goes up in thin air. If you add the limitation that you need to pay a monthly fee to keep using it to that, it increases the risk that something might go wrong, decreasing the attractiveness of RubyMotion.<p>- They already have recurring revenue, based on the fact that after one year you need to pay half of the license fee again to get support and updates.",1351879233

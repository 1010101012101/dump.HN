4766922,comment,4766612,4766612,7,0,petenixey,,,"As I'm sure Patrick knows a first degree of accuracy you could of course substitute ""Ireland"" for ""outside Silicon Valley"" and the point about acquisitions is especially well made.<p>Even in London we're seeing that the companies here are giving investor valuations that simply 1/5 of the valley and on most levels I have to say that I can't blame the investors for their pessimism as there are so, so few exits here.<p>Exits (large or small) perform three important roles for establishing a startup scene:<p>1. They create wealth for founders who are themselves much more likely to become investors<p>2. They create wealth for investors. Whether an investor is actually in on a deal or not this changes their attitude and their optimism and makes them more likely to invest due to the perceived good climate<p>3. As Patrick said, they increase the likelihood of high calibre individuals doing startups. Good people can do very well in other jobs and if they see the likelihood of success in a startup as being negligible, they'll stay elsewhere.<p>All of these three tend towards self reinforcement which is powerful. It's worth noting that none of them depend on the net P&L from angel investment to be positive, only that the net gain in perception to be positive.<p>One of the simple reasons it's very hard to sell the types of companies we discuss on HN outside the valley is that to sell a company you really need to actually meet someone willing to buy a company. These things still tend to start face to face.<p>Outside the valley there are far fewer biz-dev teams and, perhaps more importantly, far fewer engineering teams. The types of companies that create a lot of wealth are usually product focussed and get bought by product / engineering teams. Most of those acquiring teams are based in the states. FB only has a very small outpost in London and while Google's is huge and does include engineering it's predominantly sales support and does not (as far as I know) make many purchases.<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to sell my last startup (Clickpass) but there is no way that would have happened outside the valley. For that reason among many others we're moving back out to SF in January. I love SF and I'm happy to move back but sad to leave London and my life here too. However I too have come to the conclusion that it simply doesn't make sense to be outside the valley, you just set the odds too far against yourself.",1352562906

It became my hobby, along with the field of electronics. I was very keen to get to know exactly how things worked and what was happening, even up to the level of the silicon. In those days I spent more time reading datasheets and computer manuals than I did reading comics.<p>During my whole career in secondary school (VWO-B) I have been able to follow the development of the microcomputer. As far as that goes, I grew up in a very interesting era. It was the period in which the 'computing power' migrated from the centralized mainframes to various decentralized systems.<p>Due to my innate interest I became acquainted with all sorts of programming languages and fields of application for computers; I absorbed a lot of knowledge regarding the subjects that interested me the most. At the time, the topics were C, data communication, audiovisual applications, and relational databases, first on C/PM and later on MSDOS. Some years later, C++, Unix, and Windows were added. And after a while I also acquired knowledge of the Internet, the WWW, and programming languages such as Java, Java script, PHP, and Python.<p>When I was twenty years old I managed to get a job as a software developer, and since this line of work has never ceased to interest me I am currently still active as a developer.</i>",1352562409

Get the basics right.<p>Our basics include an entirely zeroMQ based service-oriented architecture (after 8-9 different iterations over the past 4 years). We spent a lot of time writing a ZMQ based DHT, and service wrappers (kinda like zeroRPC[0]). Other basics include a standardized front-end A/B testing based off genetify[1], email service (with AWS' SES), paypal service, our fair matching services and many others.<p>The one thing to note is that these basics didn't come overnight though. It came through many many iterations of different products that failed. We merely picked up the components that worked best.<p>There were things that were nice to have like automated testing and deployment options that we considered. Even using tools like Puppet and/or Chef, we determined, were not quite a good use of our time, considering our release schedule isn't all that crazy, and deployments can be managed by one human being.<p>But our situation does not apply to you. You need to think about what fits your situation, and your styles. Maybe you are the kind that pushes a release to production servers every 5 minutes. Then yes, having an automated test and build system would be extremely useful.<p>Start with simple stuff like crons and tiny scripts. Let your internal tools evolve on their own. Don't jump in to write massive automation for your systems. Instead, do it in small parts, just enough to help you.<p>Hope this helps.<p>[0] <a href=""http://zerorpc.dotcloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zerorpc.dotcloud.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://genetify.com/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genetify.com/demo/</a>",1352561215

My customers are internal customers, thus profitability and other business measures are not directly my concern.<p>The biggest issue I face with this is that my customers are non-technical people, so if I were to tell them that our infrastructure is now software defined and I have implemented analytics that will allow me to optimise the caching layer, they will most likely look at me with a puzzled expression and perhaps wonder what I'm actually doing since those things don't provide direct value to them.<p>The types of internal tools I am thinking of are things like; analytics, automated deployments, CI server etc.<p>One comment suggested I do a simple calculation like any other business decision. This is something I cannot for the life of me work out how to do. Internal tools will increase my efficiency in the future, so I guess at best I could estimate a payback time for some of these tools (like automation). Even so, how short a payback makes it worthwhile? For other tools, like analytics, how can this type of calculation be made?<p>Additionally, there are some things that are the ""right way"" to do things, such as software defined infrastructure vs managing it manually (which I currently do). Investing time in this won't have any immediate payback, but is nice to have in place in the case of a large failure when I need to recover quickly. These types of value calculations for me are not easy to make.<p>sourthyme, I like the idea of spending one day a week working on this stuff. Perhaps I need to have a conversation with my bosses/customers about this and try to explain to them the value that internal tooling will bring.<p>Thanks for the answers so far, please keep them coming.",1352560241

If so this really surprises me, considering microsofts rep, so I'd ask for links and is the C# compiler open source?<p>Finally, where's the advantage? ( I know you say your not trying to say this ) Why should people use something new unless there are reasons for it being not just as good but better at such and such? This whole post was about how MVC is just as good as Rails, which probably is true, but if you're a good dev and know your tools then Symfony2 or Django is probably just as good as well. The only reason to switch is when people start showing exceptionally new capabilities that make the devs life easier by trying out the new thing. Thats what rails did back in the day.",1352560208
4766800,comment,4766542,4766542,4,0,davycro,,,"> Almost half of those surveyed were using internet-enabled smart or feature phones. The scratch cards that many Kenyans use to charge their mobiles have recently begun to advertise their value in terms of data rather than talk time. Meanwhile, mobile-phone operators have been giving free access to sites such as Wikipedia to entice customers.<p>> Still, only 16% of respondents said they were using their phones to browse the internet.<p>The iHub report I read said that 88% of Kenyans browse the Internet with their mobile phone instead of 16%. The same report says that 99% of Internet access from Kenya is through a mobile device. I think the Western world assumes people in developing countries are dependent on computers for Internet access because of the popularity of the One Laptop Per Child program. I think we should recognize that the developing world will probably never have the resources or desire to adopt laptops or personal computers and so we should instead focus on providing them with web-content sized for their devices and hardware organizations such as OLPC should look into reducing the cost of smartphones. In my personal experience an android device in Africa costs at minimum of $200.<p>Reading this article reminds me that there is a huge demand for mobile Internet in developing world and few companies are capitalizing on this.",1352560149

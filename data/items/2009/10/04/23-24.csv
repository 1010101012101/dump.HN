Not related to the main topic, but you might find it interesting. For the past few months I was reading books exclusively on Kindle but recently I had to buy a paper book (Coders At Work) and the experience is awful so far. I can't highlight and save quotes I like, I can't make notes, I can't quickly look up a word definition.

860770,comment,859686,860132,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"There wasn't? There's been an illegal immigration problem in the States since we started clamping down on immigration. There was a large problem with Chinese immigrants in the late 1800's, early 1900's. In fact, El Paso (my hometown) was a focal point of that as well.<p>For a large part of the history of El Paso, Juarez (our sister city across the border) and El Paso flowed naturally. There wasn't really much of a divide between the two cities, up until the 1920's when a fear of lice caused Mayor Tom Lea to cut back on immigration which eventually spawned the Bath Riots. Even still, it wasn't really difficult to get into El Paso as a Hispanic individual. You simply had to go through a delousing process (designs of which Hitler used to exterminate the Jews) that sprayed you with Zyklon B and steam bathed your clothing. Not exactly the most honoring thing to go through, but you were still permitted access afterwards.<p>You could say there was even illegal immigration starting during the Mexican revolution when the States became a launching point for some of the revolutionaries. The U.S. still had this idea of neutrality and wanted those people to stay out. They came in anyway.<p>Flash forward to the WWII era and you have a program (I forget the name) that brought in Mexican citizens to work in the U.S.<p>So...you saying that there wasn't a problem until the 60's is simply misguided on one hand (there wasn't a problem because a lot of people were largely encouraged, or at least not stopped, from coming in) or horribly wrong on the other (there's been illegal immigration in this country since the quota system was introduced).<p>Like I said, you sound like someone who doesn't know jack about this subject.

860761,comment,860414,860414,0,0,shughes,,,"The only thing that kind of bothered me was that Bitbucket focused too much on blaming Amazon. Here's a sports example. Let's say a team loses because the left tackle messes up and the quarterback gets sacked. After the game, during a press conference, does the quarterback say that they lost, but it's the left tackle's fault? No. Even if the quarterback believes he himself performed great, he'll still take part of the blame. That's because it's the professional thing to do, and people respect him more for it.<p>You could say that Amazon and Bitbucket aren't on the same team, so it's different. But Bitbucket is paying Amazon to perform better just like a football team pays a player to make the team perform better. In other words, based on the concept of a team recruiting players for better team performance, Bitbucket recruits Amazon for better company performance, so they're basically on the same team.<p>That said, Bitbucket should focus less on singling out Amazon, and focus more on trying to figure out what they could have done better. It's the professional thing to do, and I'll respect them more for it.",1254698970

I think I'm at the stage that comes after the burning out.<p>I'm a single, 30yo, systems architect at a quite known and popular Web company (top 30). I also have a strong open-source persona and pretty useful projects out there (overall around 2000 watchers, I guess). HN score of about 1400, all from feedback on projects I've released.<p>I'm the guy who always get a crazy eyebrow raised when people hear I don't have my own start up yet. I get tons of offers from CTOs, CEOs and founders to co-found/participate, and I usually think of the people offering them as misguided and naive.\nAnd if we're anonymous, let me throw in that I used to be a hacker, cracker, around 13 years ago, when I was in high school.<p>End background.<p>I find myself waking up at 8:30am, at work at 9:30am, finishing up at 19:30-20:00pm and at home by 21:30pm tops (I'm not living in the US). I still have most of my vacation quota unused.\nThis leaves me with about 3 hours of free time where I do my open source work. Of that I allocate 1 hour to my girlfriend daily. I tried managing my life the traditional ways, and non-traditional ways (kanban). I even tried putting home tasks on a kanban and trying to measure velocity. All to get more time out of a day, more efficiently.\nI'm constantly in burn-out mode, but I found that I can take it.\nI become depressed, agonized, my back is killing me (even though I am in top shape -- used to compete athletically) and I cry like a girl alone sometimes. But then I pick myself up and move on; pick a task and do it.<p>Hero? no.<p>I got back to my home town yesterday (writing this hung over). Met my old friends: married + kids, and the sorts. Simple jobs (bus driver, photographer), 0-stress.<p>Where am I? where is the _exquisite_ systems architect? yes, I solve crazy problems (over 100M users), scalability and performance is my motto, but still struggling with a couple hours of free time per day, making my employer's dream come true (On several occasions, I had direct first hand influence on company's success -- i.e. if no me, no success, or at least considerable fiasco).<p>I have no friends (its quite hard to keep in touch when you have a couple hours a day, which you already use up).\nI barely see my family.<p>I'm not half the man I used to be, before the University-startup-startup-startup-enterprise-startup jobs run.<p>Should I give up everything to be a bus driver, a photographer, and move to a quiet town, leave the city and all of my skills and knowledge?\nI don't know who I am anymore.\nThat's the question that bothers me.<p>Anyone recognizes this?",1332247868

You try to fix it and still happy.\nYear three:You can't fix everything and you start to hit walls. You realize things aren't actually that different from before but still different. you hang on.\nYear four: After a possible internal change you finally realize that it's just more of the same in a different colour, you start to think about another change.\nYear five:the same shit as before, without a perspective, at least non you like, you find something else. The cycle starts again.<p>Good people management as discribed in the article and the linked articles can mitigate this. Really good companies may add a cpuple of years, perfect ones may retain you forever if they exist at all. But sooner or later you will get something different, not necessarily better. Sad thing is that alo tof companies, and I don't mean your direct boss here but companies in general, do near to nothing about it. The end result being that the whole system is nearing the absolute average, the talents either being bosses (if they adapt, pgs essay on popularity comes to my mind), burned out and disillusioned (pretty likely) or start-up founders (where possible and hopefully successfull).",1332247663

Workers wanting more OT (and more guaranteed hours in general) is a common refrain in the third of the book which deals with the emerging factory towns in Wenzhou province. Working at the smaller factories entails unsteady, unpredictable hours. Another major concern for workers is not working under too dangerous conditions, represented in the book by fake leather factories, which use chemicals with foul, dangerous fumes in their manufacturing process.

3728910,comment,3728313,3728670,16,0,bane,,,"I've yet to encounter a language that flows as nicely as Perl does, from thought to code. I haven't been a serious programmer for many years, and I can still sit down, after months or years of not writing any code, and hack out some Perl code almost as fast as I can type. One of these days when I have some time I'll need to get my Perl skills up to 2012 levels as the language has moved on so much from where I was when I sat down with ""Perl for Dummies"" in 2000 and became proficient enough in the language in a week to build some fairly major linguistics tools for the company I was working at at the time. (As a set of total side projects to my normal C++ production life).<p>Once you realize that the control structures flow like an English sentence, once you <i>grok</i> that, the language simply gets out of the way. It's not bound to an ivory tower of a certain paradigm. It's a human language. Sure you can write Perl that's almost unreadable, but you can do that in many programming languages, and you can do it in real human languages. Written well, reading Perl is like reading beautiful poetry.<p>Case in point, I once wrote a program in Perl, about 30,000 lines of code (which by Perl standards is relatively large, a Java port ended up about six times as large), then didn't see it for 2 years. I was asked to guide a team to port the code to Java, I sat down one afternoon, and just <i>read</i> the code like a book. After that I almost never had to refer to the code again, and guided the team through the rest of the porting process. I knew it like I had just read a novel. Cause and effect was obvious, the bundling of the chapters (modules) made dramatic sense, and when I had to refer to the code to show it to one of the Java devs, it took seconds to find the code segment in <i>notepad</i> of all things.<p>Very little boilerplate, the best integration of regexes in the industry, yet still powerful enough to write major sites and applications in.<p>Downside: it ruined me as a developer, all the BS you have to go through in other languages to just get something done seems like such <i>busy work</i>. I ended up writing a set of libraries in C++ to handle lots of things in a perlish sort of way, typeless primitives, perl style containers, etc. But at the time C++ didn't have the same kinds of sentence-like control structures and simple regex matches always became a dozen lines of compiling regexes and then matching, and then iterating some data structure to get at the results. Painful.<p>Java became intolerable. I remember the last time I sat down to write something in Java, spending hours hunting through the standard library documentation thinking ""this is bullshit, I shouldn't have to create xyz minor feature from whole cloth, it's <i>got</i> to be in the standard library, for fuck's sake Java has 3 gui frameworks and I have to parse a csv file by hand!!!""",1332247440

I don't regret the selling part but I know now that I could have made my own life a load easier if I just stopped and looked at things objectively.<p>It sounds to me like you need to get some perspective on things so I would suggest:<p>1) Talk to your co-founder. They probably see you in ways you don't realise and they should understand that for the sake of the startup it is best to give you a bit of support. If they don't then seriously think about whether you want to continue with someone who won't support you (and the startup) when you need them to.<p>2) Take a break. By this I mean a real break where your cell phone is off for at least a week if not two. Where you do as little as possible and try not to even think about work. It might take a bit of time to get yourself a chance to do this but you have to.<p>3) Learn to meditate. It will totally change the way you look at things. The feeling of suffering and pain you have comes from your mind being out of control - you know rationally that it isn't as bad as it seems and said as much above. Learning to calm your mind and get rid of the fog will help you look at what really is important and you will feel more in control and positive.<p>3) Remember that you are only human. There is nothing wrong with making mistakes and things getting on top of you. You must learn to not be perfect and be happy that you are as you are. There is no shame in needing help.<p>5) If the above don't work for you go and see a doctor. Depression is a real and sometimes very severe illness. For some people (but only some) medication is the right answer.<p>Hope that helps.",1332245141

Great at implementing prototypes, getting things working fast, but absolutely terrible with polishing things and taking care of edge cases.<p>And I <i>hate</i> it. I consider it a personality flaw, a flaw in my work ethics, and so on. Whatever it is, I don't want to have it.<p>What I've found has helped me get beyond this problem is taking on freelancing gigs where I'm mostly the guy who gets a rough prototype and has to make it work. The beauty of this is that I know how to think like a prototyper, so I can become productive on a foreign codebase quickly.<p>And because I started at a different goalpost, I can still work as a ""starter"" even though I'm doing the job of a ""debugger/finisher"".",1332244836

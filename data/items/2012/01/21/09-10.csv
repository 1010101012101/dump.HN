3493194,comment,3492711,3493029,8,0,waterlesscloud,,,"What you describe is largely how things work right now.<p>Independent production companies, which represent  the origin of most non-blockbuster films, work just like incubators now.<p>They have a development budget which they use to find and develop scripts in what might as well be an early seed round.  They then shop this developed project around to financing sources, of which there are a great number that are not tied to studios. These financing sources may require  additional development or even ""pivoting"" of the project.<p>Once financing is secured and the people providing the funding are happy, production can proceed.  At this point, you're still wholly outside the studio system.  You can completely finish your film outside the studios. This happens now, all the time, and it happens not just with Sundance style films, but with mainstream films with pretty substantial budgets.<p>Sundance, as an aside, is not just a festival, but also a market for these independent productions. Festivals such as Cannes and Toronto are much the same. You'll see a number of stories over the next week about films acquired at  Sundance.  What this means is that distribution deals were signed for films that were produced using means independent of the studios.  The distributors are often, but not always, arms of the studios.<p>Someone mentioned Brad Pitt.  He stars in independently financed projects all the time.  In fact, he himself is often the indie producer, via his company Plan B which arranges for the financing through other entities.",1327139838

You're talking about disrupting two things, neither of which are entertainment:  distribution of finished goods (external), and the system within that's been in place since the fall of the studio system in the '60s (internal).  Neither of these things have <i>that</i> much to do with entertainment.  Technology has made being a filmmaker far, far cheaper than it used to be even in the heyday of indie film in the 90s, though there is still a high financial barrier to entry to pay for all the quality things you need on a set (oh, an idea!).

As more and more of the technical complexity goes away and the cost of the art as well will drop, these big productions will start to face immense pressure from smaller teams.<p>You already see more and more games use licensed engines, and eventually the power of the platforms we deal with will intersect with rising quality of low cost or free engines at point where most people can start with an existing low cost engine and compete technically.<p>We started with a situation where off-the-shelf game engines was unthinkable, because game engines were optimized for a specific gameplay and intertwined with the game logic, but already there's a huge market for games made on licensed engines (and as far back as the 80's you had the first attempts at making ""game maker"" programs that used off the shelf engines and tools to cut the effort of making games)<p>Similarly on the art side you can expect to see more and more advanced tools that take away technical complexity of working on the art and return the focus to the art process itself and even simplify that.<p>E.g. consider a hypothetical tool where an artist creating a new character can pick from a catalogue of hundreds of pre-made skeletal structures, choose characteristics of the muscles and size, movement characteristics etc., pick from pre-made physical characteristics as a starting point for alterations, pick from catalogues of clothes, hair, eyes and so on - even other parts like the voice of the character, and have the software fill in the rest in terms of animation and other aspects.<p>Imagine a cottage industry of artists that design catalogue items for tools like this - you can already license tons of ready-made 3D models, after all, as well as specialized software for things like creating landscapes, plants, trees and a bunch of other 3D structures.<p>Of course none of this would remove the need for developers or artists, but it will free them to focus on game play and the actual art rather than how to work around technical limitations, and it becomes a massive leveller for smaller teams if you can start with an off the shelf engine, and populate your game with a bunch off catalogue item characters and then customize rather than having to start from scratch.<p>Incidentally a lot of these changes will eventually benefit independent movies as well in terms of making advanced CGI and postprocessing cheaper and more accessible.",1327139617

Denying Netflix content for a little longer might hurt Netflix because people will come to Netflix during that time, look for the content, and not find it.  So if that's true wouldn't it just be easier to never give Netflix the content.  I mean, if they're trying to kill Netflix that would seem the way to go.<p>The truth is they aren't trying to kill Netflix they're trying to maximize profit which is what every company does.  They are delaying movies to Netflix because they've found people will buy the movies from iTunes during that time period.<p>If that will kill Netflix it's their job to say ""hey, we're a revenue stream for you and we're going to go away if you delay these movies"" and then a negotiation will ensue.  This is how capitalism works with each company trying to make as much money as they can and companies negotiating with each other to do so.<p>Having said that I've always believed media should be treated as a monopoly and regulated accordingly.

However, this is untenable in Hollywood because the standard is to use a fucked up accounting structure which results in most movies showing no profit on paper. Instead, a small number of people end up taking home a percentage of the gross revenues of the movie and most of the earnings for everyone else are upfront in cash.<p>This has several negative effects. For one it makes any movie staring a big star very much more expensive because you have to pay them $x million out of pocket. Also, because it raises the budget floor for making a top tier feature film it forces the industry to take fewer perceived risks, because a financial loss would be more devastating.<p>But this is only Hollywood's poisonous culture, not a fundamental aspect for making films.

3493086,comment,3491542,3491542,11,0,koko775,,,"As an engineer working at a startup that is actively challenging the entertainment status quo through a slightly non-traditional vector, this RFS strikes me as amazingly naive and lacks any realistic suggestion for what kind of challenges might be most effective.<p>Hollywood isn't dying, nor is it anywhere close. Shedding some excess, maybe, but not dying. It's an overweight person rationalizing away his weight problem instead of committing himself fully to do whatever it takes to become lean and efficient. Apologies if that offends; I don't mean any malice. I simply mean to point out that even without Hollywood, there are any number of entertainment pieces constantly being produced and distributed. Indeed, Hollywood is, in my opinion, little more than a destination and mini-society that brings together and publishes works, as well as an ecosystem of funding. Try finding an animated movie that truly, terribly falls flat like some films. It'll be harder than it would be for a fully live-action film, because they know that without star power or explosions as a fallback, that much more effort needs to be spent on narrative to produce something that, if nothing else, will not tank incredibly. Is it any wonder that the animated versions of large or popular franchises typically have terrible movie productions?<p>( in this case I am also including live action movies with a very major animated component, i.e. a mix of live-action and animated characters)<p>The people who build the technological platforms hosting today's entertainment are, by and large, not dumb people. It takes some real skill to scale a site that serves up any number of combinations of video profiles and different target platforms. This, especially, is somewhere the cloud has trouble with cost-effectiveness. Video loads are large, and can be CPU, RAM, and I/O bound (if you're trying to make the most of your resources), and iteration and improvement on the process can take hours or days, not simply minutes, for almost-imperceptible but possibly still important improvements. There are reasons it works for Netflix and reasons that it's more expensive for smaller companies to scale. There's also the fact that DRM is often a contractual obligation, and the start-up costs can run well into the several hundreds of thousands of dollars range, not including high upkeep contributing to a gargantuan TCO by any startup's standards. Then there's the revenue sharing, of course.<p>The problem is not technology, or throwing more startups at the problem. The innovation <i>must</i> come from hacking the business side, or altering the deal with how content providers bring their content to the masses. Building more technology without doing this will waste people's lives and embitter them, because entertainment is being held back not by the available channels to get it to you, but because taking risks and failing fast nets you a blacklist from the people licensing you the content. Put another way, the content providers are choking off new media, not the actual proponents of new media. The pipeline of people making a living off of this stuff leads into hollywood and anything that can be done to divert them away from that walled garden and into a content bazaar will do more to kill Hollywood than actually targeting Hollywood ever will.<p>The solution, in my opinion, is to empower the entertainers and the content producers to reach their audience more directly, more broadly, and with more engagement than a TV or, let's say, a comic book will ever be able to give you. As a medium for entertainment production, YouTube falls flat. It's not the product online entertainment wants to be. It's not a product designed for simulcasts, and it's not a product designed for building communities, or for social watching, or for alternative media formats, or for worldwide publishing with subtitles of customizable language or styles, with pre-roll, mid-roll, or post-roll ads, or for subscription-based monetization. And even if some of these exist separately, they're not all in one place.<p>Also, large video ad tech is fucking terrible and poorly specified, except for Hulu, which has full access to its own tech, which it doesn't license out, as it runs its own in-house ad network. Ad companies tend to have shitty engineers or get bought by Google. But Admob's video ads monetize poorly compared to the other (technically worse) options, surprisingly.",1327136774

Anyways I'm not sure when this started, but Facebook now checks the songs that accompany video uploads. (As an interesting aside, these vids weren't public; they were only shared with friends or friends of friends.) When it feels that it finds a match,  it either disallows the video upload or it just kills all the sound. If there was a service sold mini-licenses for (indy) songs to normal people for use on Facebook, that would be great.<p>To get to the point: This would be a great way for people to hear new music, especially if the video had the name of the artist and song.<p>2) I'm not sure if this exists, but I remember hearing that you need a record label to get your music published iTunes. It would be nice to have a easy and cheap intermediary that acts as a record label to iTunes and feels like an App Store for developers to the actual bands and artists.",1327136636

I don't know why it is assumed that a beta solution should ship with the ability to produce ""Avatar"" caliber productions.<p>When it comes to technology, I'm optimistic that it has almost limitless potential to revolutionize. My instinct tells me though that a startup aimed at competing against Hollywood doesn't have to be about inventing alternate forms of entertainment, but rather to work at optimizing on alternate means of production and distribution of the already successful form of entertainment. Recent efforts with other media have shown that most optimizations are about cutting out as much unnecessary intermediary layers as possible.<p>I'm convinced that a number of people currently working within the Hollywoodian system are unhappy with the present arrangements and I would not be surprised if a few were to come out the woodwork because of this YC invitation. Their expertise will be essential, because if my guess is correct, I think that a large majority of people on HN are complete ignorami when it comes to making a movie or a tv show. We're more consumers and critics than we are creators or producers of such material.<p>Another thing would be to look at what currently exist that tries to spearhead such alternate efforts.

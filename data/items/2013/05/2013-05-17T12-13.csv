I have no intention to upgrade to Mint 15 at this point.<p>The problem is, Ubuntu 13.04 is only supported for 9 months, and it's already been a month since the release. Since Mint recommends fresh installs rather than upgrading between releases, it means you'll have less than 8 months to play with it before you must wipe it and move to Mint 16. That's a rather short shelf life for an ""ambitious"" release.<p>Since Canonical seems unwilling to support any non-LTS release for more than a few months anymore, it might be a good idea for the Mint team to reconsider their release cycles as well. Perhaps they should stick to LTS releases and work more aggressively on backporting stuff. Perhaps they should finally switch their main distro to a rolling release based on Debian (LMDE). In either case, I don't think there's much point following Ubuntu releases as closely as Mint has done so far.",1368795342

Something that is of value. Most people managers don't do that.<p>In most corporates management really is book keeping. Managing vacations, leaves, holidays. Filling up appraisal sheets, expense documents, coordinating with HR, forwarding Information, arranging meetings and all these kind of assorted chores. This classifies under what you can call as 'running the affairs' as they are.<p>This has nothing to do building something awesome. That is a different territory. What managers in most companies do ideally is enforce sanity by bringing in mediocrity. Much of their work is in bringing in a process so that their life gets easier. They need numbers, so they have to deal and force people to do things like fill in time sheets, constantly update some system to keep the their managers alerted. You get the point?<p>Situation only gets worse because, sooner or later all managers realize- they hit a career dead end unless they are politically well connected within an organization to get that next promotion or a travel opportunity. In many ways they are forced to, their position encourages them to. Imagine having no coding skills, no ideas, no ways to show that you got something real done in years. Over time your own value in the market will fall down to point you know you can't really get any real work done any where.

Building on top of the GMail platform obviates the need to actually do any of the grungy mail stuff. But as one commenter noted elsewhere in this thread, the lock-in implications are pretty sobering.<p>We made Inky from scratch -- without building on top of GMail, Outlook, etc. -- partly to avoid the lock-in, but primarily because it's hard to imagine fundamentally changing the email user experience without touching any of the code for the mail platform itself. The downside, of course, is the usual trade-off: by not layering on top of somebody else's already-debugged stack, we have to make our <i>own</i> huge raft of code work right.<p>The analogy to Lotus Notes should be a wake-up call to CIOs everywhere; our analysis of the enterprise email/messaging space makes it clear that the big companies still using Lotus Notes are doing so primarily because they have too much investment in the Notes ecosystem (""intranet web sites"" built on top of Notes, etc.) to switch. They come up with an internal estimate of the cost to convert all the stuff they've built on the Lotus platform over to something else and realize that figure exceeds the likely N-year savings from switching.

I'm going to use <a href=""https://blockchain.info/wallet/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/wallet/</a> as an example.<p>The website presents to the user a page that asks for their identifier or username, if they can provide either of those, the server returns an AES encrypted file containing all of the private keys for the bitcoin wallet. Using JavaScript, these are decrypted with the users password when and if they can supply it. At face value, this means that the server will never be able to see the wallet, or spend from it. There's quite a few very nasty attack vectors against this service though.<p>• Any browser plugins have full access to everything in the wallet, at any time. Most people run AdBlock, or Ghostery, or SSL Everywhere, a compromise of any plugin (or a malicious author) can steal coins at their will.<p>• The server can modify the client code at any time, which means that it could be changed to send back the private keys once they have been decrypted, or to simply send back the password when entered.<p>• The website offers a ""verifier plugin"" for their users to use, which supposedly verifies the contents of blockchain.info for malicious activity. If you look at the source of the plugin on github, it pretty much prevents XSS and nothing else. There's absolutely nothing stopping somebody at blockchain.info from modifying the code.<p>• Any person in the world can download the encrypted wallet, and preform an offline attack on it in their own time. Due to the way wallets are stored the public key is exposed, meaning a malicious entity can check the balance of the wallet before launching the full power of their GPUs against it. This particular attack was noted by the community, and blockchain.info started sending email notifications out to their users; many users noticed quickly how many people were downloading wallets to attack. It's not like the bitcoin community suffer a deficit of graphics cards.<p>• The encryption of the wallet files is hilarious; AES and 20 rounds of PBKDF2. I doubt that there's any off-the-shelf implementations that can handle it, but I wager oclHashCat could probably be easily modified to attack them. If it can manage 3 million attempts against 1Password keychains, it would be magnitudes faster against this.<p>The author is well aware of all of this, and still keeps the misleading statements about the security of the service on the introduction page.",1368794947

5723915,comment,5723136,5723691,1,0,mpessas,,,"> An interesting point about i18n that is quite independent from the tool selection is how you write your message identifiers. You can basically use labels (i.e, an ID for the string) or use the ""original"" string.<p>> Here's the tradeoff: if you use an ID, you must reference the application constantly to understand what the translation should say (and in any non trivial application, this is a huge burden for translators), and there is either no string reuse (because places with the same intended content have used different IDs), or the need for an anal curator to go around chastising developers (""the OK button should always be ACTION_BUTTON_LABEL_OK!! fix it!!""). On the other hand, if you use original strings in English you will find that you experience language collisions (two places where the original string in English is the same, but the translated one is not), so you end up resorting to introducing artificial differences to make them unique (i.e ""Request (verb)"" and ""Request (substantive)"" instead of just ""Request"").<p>The PO format uses the field ""context"" to differentiate among the various uses of a word/phrase. You should also add   a comment for your translators in this case.<p>Also, using an ID messes with the PO format itself. E.g., fallbacks in case of a missing translation will not work.<p>But there are other formats that are ID-based, like .properties in Java.",1368794643

In this case the private company is taking over the public company with the aim of taking itself public.

In this case, the stock continues to trade (possibly at a premium depending on the terms of the merger) but the underlying business has changed possibly dramatically. Several airlines have gone public through reverse takeovers.

Employees in our company can just login (Zanata provides OpenID authentication) and collaboratively translate and review the application strings. Whereas Zanata can be used to export ressource files and push projects to our external translation provider's platform via their API.<p>But as others have said in this thread, l10n automation curently involves a lot of manual code glueing and adapting with your version control system.

It started out as a promising idea that eventually did not fulfil its full potential. The book is still a work in progress and the backer rewards for people who put more than $60 were never delivered. You can see backer complaints under the comments tab.<p>It’s been more than 15 months and even the Pebble watch, a project that closed its funding later has delivered most of the watches to the hands of its backers.<p>My initial worry was that they got my mailing address wrong but a tweet verified otherwise.\n""sorry they're sitting in our closet waiting to get mailed, @blumenfeld is working on it""<p>So I guess he passed on that responsibility to someone else and its someone else's fault now?\nFrustrated, I personally emailed Enrique thrice, 1 week apart to request for help on the backer rewards. Not receiving a single reply, I decided to ask for a refund and gave an ultimatum.\nThe entire saga made me think about how someone this prominent in SV can be this irresponsible. I've never met Enrique in person and can't be a judge of his character but I do think he owns all backers a written apology and should either process requests for refund promptly or just mail the rewards out.<p>If you'll like to help, kindly upvote this thread so the matter could be resolved.",1368793312

These people are the ones who say ""just do it"", because for them, the only trick is to stop thinking and roll up their sleeves.

These are the people who will go around saying that they have finally found the magic bullet that solves their productivity problems.<p>Some people have a ton of mental blocks. Often these are beliefs that work as cross-purposes.<p>For example, it sounds like you have the belief ""if someone else makes something that I had the idea for, that's terrible"". This pushes the ""knot inside you to inarticulately roar"". Trick is it's not that you want to work on something cool, it's that you don't want to <i>not</i> have worked on something cool (subtle, but important difference - negative motivation is very poor at driving creative work).<p>Another belief is ""all I want is to get something finished, these things hold me up on things that I know should be almost trivially easy"". This one is familiar to me. This conflicts badly with belief number #1, since one part of your brain is telling you you have to get coding, and another part is flashing warning bells telling you that whatever you are doing can't be worthwhile because it's so hard. Result: paralysis.<p>The good news is you can debug these different blocking beliefs.<p>I learned most of this stuff from PJ Eby's site: trouble is he uses an offputting sales-letter/self-helpy language, but the ideas are golden. <a href=""http://pjeby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjeby.com/</a> <a href=""http://thinkingthingsdone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkingthingsdone.com/</a> are your starting points. \nEmail me (isaac@i.saac.me) if you (or anyone else) wants to talk more; I'm thinking of starting a site which communicates some of these ideas.",1368792706

Of course you need mathematics for that.

6772177,comment,6770785,6771808,1,0,IanCal,,,"> This assumes that distance in the vector space strongly correlates to &quot;similarity&quot; in the thing I&#x27;m trying to understand. How do I know my vector model actually does that? (For example, how does the author know &quot;has some word&quot; is a useful metric for measuring post similarity?)<p>There isn&#x27;t a great answer to this I&#x27;m afraid. It&#x27;s a combination of &quot;Well it seems to make sense&quot; and &quot;we tried it and it worked&quot;. There can be a lot of trial and error.<p>> (For example, how does the author know &quot;has some word&quot; is a useful metric for measuring post similarity?)<p>Specifically about this one, that&#x27;s mostly because it makes some sense and is used a lot elsewhere. It&#x27;s simple and tends to work reasonably well, doesn&#x27;t require trying to parse and understand sentences, etc. The idea is that the words you say are likely to be closely linked to the thing you&#x27;re talking about.<p>The next step up from this (usually called BoW, or Bag of Words) is fairly straightforward, it&#x27;s how often each word appears as a fraction of the total document. Up from there is one of the most commonly used approaches called TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) which is almost the same but it modifies the counts based on how rare the words are. I go straight for TF-IDF as it&#x27;s fairly sensible, simple and tends to work well in practice.<p>> I like what I got out of the post a lot, but the &quot;this is easy&quot; part only seems easy because it swept the hard part under the rug.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between making something that works and making something that works well. A lot of domain knowledge and technical knowledge might be required for the second, but the first might be a lot more attainable than people think.",1384991874

6772122,comment,6769349,6771813,3,0,PetitPrince,,,"> Every once in a while, a botched and buggy game with tremendous potential will be buffed and polished by an obsessed modding community, revealing a classic that the developers were never given time to realize. Games like Troika&#x27;s Vampire: Bloodlines or Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s KOTOR2 are still evolving online. I&#x27;ve been holding off replaying KOTOR2 for years because I know it just keeps getting closer to the game it was meant to be every year.<p>A game that is worth mentioning here is Falcon 4. More than 10 years after its initial release people have (and are still ?) modding it.

Research papers are meant to be read by researchers who are interested in advancing the state of the art. They are usually pretty bad introductory texts.<p>In particular, mathematical details regarding whether or not the space is closed, complete, convex, etc. are usually both irrelevant and incomprehensible to a practitioner but are essential to the inner workings of the mathematical proofs.<p>Practitioners who want to apply the classic algorithms should seek a good book, a wikipedia article, blog post or survey paper.

6772059,comment,6771260,6771477,29,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>One should ban antibiotics for animals world wide.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t go quite that far. I am on record here on HN as agreeing with a doctor who said in an interview,<p>&quot;Q: Do you think we have enough data to know what’s happening with the antibiotics used on the farm?<p>&quot;A: I think we know enough to say that we need to be doing a better job of improving appropriate use of antibiotics in all sectors, humans and animals.<p>&quot;Q: But the agriculture sector is different, because antibiotics have been used there for a long time with an eye toward improving the growth of the animals, really for food purposes, to make them bigger and fatter with less food. Does that concern you as a use?<p>&quot;A: Certainly the CDC believes quite firmly, and I think there are a number of veterinary experts here and in other places who agree with the stance that we should never be using antibiotics in agriculture or in people for any other purpose than to treat infections.<p>&quot;Using antibiotics to promote growth in animals is not a good use of antibiotics. It’s not careful use of this really delicate and invaluable resource.&quot;[1]<p>I am also on record as saying, responding to a passage in another thread-opening article,<p>>> &quot;What Europe did: In the EU, all antibiotics used in human medicines are banned on farms—and no antibiotics can be used on farms for &#x27;non-medical purposes,&#x27; i.e., growth promotion.&quot; <<<p>I&#x27;d like to see the United States follow that lead immediately, and I write this as a man who has several uncles and cousins who are farmers, including some who raise cattle. It makes sense to me to have lines of defense against transmission of animal-infecting, and especially antibiotic-resistant-animal-infecting, microbes to human beings, by controlling what animals raised as lifestock eat and how they are treated with veterinary medicines.[2]<p>Animals get sick, both on and off the farm. Careful veterinary practice can enhance human health, by reducing sources of zoonotic infections. The epidemiologists who work to prevent human disease also keep track of news of animal infections on the farm and in the wild.[3] With this in mind, I can&#x27;t agree with the policy idea<p><i>One should ban antibiotics for animals world wide.</i><p>expressed in the parent post. We should be careful about the use of antibiotics, many of which were originally &quot;natural&quot; substances emitted by microorganisms as a defense against other microorganisms, and we should use antibiotics mostly to treat cases of actual human or animal disease, and also use other infection control measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases either to humans or to nonhuman animals, wherever they live.<p>AFTER EDIT:<p>Meanwhile, in human medicine, the development through natural selection of multiple-drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis is very alarming. I wish India were doing better in controlling tuberculosis. Both a newspaper in the United States, which did much to break the story,[4] and a newspaper from India[5] are in agreement with official sources from both countries[6][7] that much more needs to be done to stop the spread of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in India, which could threaten the health of the whole world.

Does each K-Means iteration always reach a stable configuration? When can you expect it to converge fast? How do you choose the number of clusters, and how does this affect convergence speed? Does the way you initialize your centroids have a significant effect on the outcome? If yes, which initializations tend to work better in which situations?<p>These are all questions I might ask in an interview, but more importantly, being able to answer these is often the difference between blindly applying a technique and applying it intelligently.

Interpreting what the equation actually means (let&#x27;s say in English) proved to be hard though and spawned multiple, sometimes conflicting or paradoxical interpretations.

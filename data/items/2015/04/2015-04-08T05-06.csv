9339009,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,UntitledNo4,,,"I&#x27;m 40, started working as a programmer only about 10 years ago, so I definitely have more lost opportunities that you. But I don&#x27;t care. I manage to make a good living, enjoy what I do and get the appreciation of my clients for the work I do, and that&#x27;s what I wanted when I went my own way. 
I can understand though, and I think part of the problem is actually HN. When I started reading it I was suddenly informed of many new (to me, at least) programming languages and other technologies. I felt behind and thought I needed to learn, or at least understand, them all, but I didn&#x27;t have the time -- I had much work to do during the day, and then no will power to learn anything new in the evenings after I had finished working for the day. So then I felt guilty about it -- how do other people manage to both work and learn all those things at once? I don&#x27;t know. I just stopped feeling bad about it since (as stated above) I make a good living, enjoy myself doing this and get appreciated for my work, and that&#x27;s what important to me.<p>There are two things that I do that might help you though:<p>1. I only read NH when I&#x27;m not working (i.e. mornings or evenings). That means I can focus on my work rather than get involved with something else.<p>2. When I read about a new exciting technology, unless it&#x27;s relevant to what I am working on at the moment, I bookmark the page, in case it becomes relevant in the future. In the process I realised a lot of it is trends. People on HN get excited about something and a year later they&#x27;re excited about something new, and then the old gets criticised. So basically, I saved myself a few hours learning something that wasn&#x27;t so important to know after all.<p>Edit: formatting",1428472787

However, I&#x27;m with you in that I don&#x27;t think there should be any pressure not to try it anyway. I have a custom-built desktop machine that I can install anything I want on, so if something breaks or falls over, I can simply reinstall another OS (while getting real work done on my laptop).",1428472707
9339005,comment,9338408,9338408,0,0,fsloth,,,"I think a scrum/kanban board is a very strong instrument in implementing a healthy development process. There should be an explicit method to updating the board - even if the method is just &quot;you can move only your own tickets&quot;. If there is an intact development process that lacks a board&ticket system I don&#x27;t see it is necessary to implement one. However, broken development processes often have a problem of priorization and communication and discplined ticket and board tracking system can help there a lot.<p>Now, the daily standup is one method of updating the board with the added benefit that it provides maximum bandwidth of information of team status in a brief time to all team members.<p>The author stipulated that in their team everyone else already knows what others are doing. If so, great. However, I think it is really naive to think this would hold for all teams. For teams that lack this amount of coordination and transparency I would see a healthy standup that is brief and to the point improves teamwork as it helps synchronize work.<p>Not all teams are composed of equal members. There can be coherent products whose team members work on completely different areas of the code and the product to implement the feature and in those instances I would imagine it would slow down total velocity if everyone would need to keep tabs on what everyone else is doing. For instance, a dedicated tester might be a part of the team, who is not so interested in explicit submits but rather what is the current end-user interface status.<p>Not all people are comfortable in asking support due to shyness and so on. Having an explicit process of synchronizing work and announcing impediments can help there a lot. Since impediment removal is part of the process, the person asking for help does not need to feel like a bother (and they notice others need help too), the work progresses and everyone is more relaxed. The counter argument is that people should already be good at teamwork - sadly this is not true, great teamwork is not inbread to humans, but, everyone can learn it and having a teamwork supporting process in place helps to maintain a healthy culture.<p>So, I suppose, in the end, it&#x27;s not necessarily about standup vs. no standup, it&#x27;s about having processes that helps supporting a healthy team culture, whatever it is. For small teams with long term stability this is less of an issue but the more ephemeral the team constitution is and the larger it is the more value a healthy standup process can bring (healthy as in by-the-book-scrum healthy - to follow the manifesto style - I prefer a by-the-book-scrum standup that is about bringing value to the team to a standup that is converted to a managerial status update).",1428472696

9339002,comment,9336392,9337837,0,0,rajacombinator,,,"Thanks for the illustration. Andrew or whoever is interested in propagating this concept should consider throwing together a few examples and a calculator on a website so people can play around with the numbers.<p>This is super innovative and cool - provided it holds up legally and with the IRS. (I gather it&#x27;s meant to be a tax-efficient approach.) I sympathize with Andrew&#x27;s motivation because as a founder, if my company made it big, I would want all the employees to do well. I always figured in that case I would just pay them out of pocket and take a huge tax hit to make it happen.<p>On the other hand, as a founder who has not yet &quot;made it&quot;, an extra 50% hit on top of the 50% the taxman will take, is way more than I can stomach. The potential for outlandish wealth is part of what motivates me, even though I would be fine with much less. But the percentage and threshold can be adjusted to find numbers that should be suitable for anyone.<p>One thing that I&#x27;m not clear on and I didn&#x27;t read through all the legalese is on what basis the &quot;taxed&quot; amount is redistributed to the remaining employees. If it&#x27;s based on share vesting like a normal system, it sounds like it wouldn&#x27;t change the distribution much. If it&#x27;s an even split it sounds potentially unreasonable, for instance, to give 2.5 million an employee who joined 2 weeks ago.<p>Either way cool stuff and I&#x27;d expect something like this to become standard in Silicon Valley.",1428472676

Family Sharing was only recently introduced by Apple. Before that, it was very cumbersome for a couple to share their music libraries. The same applies to most subscription services. Take Amazon for example: my wife can share free Prime shipping with me, but not Prime Music.<p>I wonder if this is for legal reasons (licensing, etc.) or because of the people that create such services. My wife&#x27;s hypothesis is that since a lot of technology is created by single, young and not very social people, it doesn&#x27;t even cross their mind at design time the fact that a couple (or a whole family) might want to share some of their contents while still keeping their own individual accounts.",1428472586

9338993,comment,9336291,9336291,0,0,reuven,,,"I used Mailman for more than 10 years, to run a fairly large (3,000-person) list.  Before that, I had used a number of other mailing list managers.<p>It&#x27;s true that Mailman was rock solid.  But it had a number of features that made it difficult for users and administrators alike.<p>In particular, users who were not computer savvy complained bitterly that they couldn&#x27;t easily search through the archives, couldn&#x27;t understand how to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves, and that the archives (in their repeated messages to the moderators) didn&#x27;t look like the mailing lists on Google and Yahoo.<p>In other words, it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to have solid software. Mailman needed a modern UI.  It took some time, but that moment seems to have come.  It&#x27;s a bit too late for me; for a variety of reasons (many having nothing to do with Mailman), I recently moved my mailing list to Google Groups.<p>I&#x27;m very happy to see this new set of functionality aimed at making Mailman relevant for a new generation of users.  Kudos to the maintainers for sticking with the project, and for providing a valuable service that shouldn&#x27;t need to be outsourced to third parties.  And for not only pushing forward with the internals, but also on the UI. It looks quite snazzy and impressive, and should help to keep Mailman relevant for many more years.",1428472519

9338985,comment,9335607,9338943,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> When the deceased was committing a felony themselves, why can&#x27;t they take 100% of their own felony murder charge? We don&#x27;t need multiple people to face full consequences for a single act.<p>If you view punishment retributively, as a blood price that must be paid, that argument makes sense -- when you have multiple people available to take the cost, only one of them should need to (of course, if you view it that way, its hard to see how the person who died can, if felony murder has a blood price, be said to pay it.)<p>But, while retribution is no doubt <i>part</i> of the basis of punishments in the American system, its not the sole basis. If two people act together to commit a murder directly, we punish them both as principles. If two people act together to commit a felony in which someone is one of them -- whether or not it is one of them -- why shouldn&#x27;t both be fully liable (whehter or not both can be punished) for felony murder?<p>A crime doesn&#x27;t necessarily have only one principal, and when it has more than one, we don&#x27;t generally only punish one. And if it has multiple principals and one of them is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, or immune to punishment for some other reason, that doesn&#x27;t absolve the other principals of punishment.

This is because emacs has both a simpler set of underlying elements and a richer extension language when compared with something like Eclipse. This makes it IDE-like, but much more expressive and elaborate: there are things you can do with emacs that you could only dream of doing in things like Eclipse.<p>Furthermore, writing extensions for emacs is much more pleasant than writing extensions for Eclipse, and is done much more widely. And, emacs has been around long enough that you have literally <i>decades</i> worth of extensions already available to you. Additionally, emacs is used widely enough that people are quick to add emacs support for new things: if I pick up a new esoteric language tomorrow, I can be 99% sure that there&#x27;s no Eclipse support for it, but I can be 100% sure that there&#x27;s already an emacs mode for it and it&#x27;s probably on the emacs package manager already, to boot.<p>All this is both a plus and a minus, in some ways: learning emacs is probably not worth it unless you&#x27;re willing to put the time and effort into building up your emacs configuration into something IDE-like, but if that&#x27;s what you want to do, then emacs can do truly amazing things.

More mature teams can probably do this without a scheduled meeting.<p>In an Extreme Programming team provide a good opportunity to swap around pair-programming partners.<p>It&#x27;s also a good opportunity to decide how many tasks the team has capacity to take on today, which isn&#x27;t entirely straightforward. There may be someone off sick which means we can run fewer pairs. There might be an urgent production issue from overnight which requires a pair&#x27;s attention. It might be that one of the next tasks needs some research and doesn&#x27;t warrant a pair. It might be that one of the next tasks is a bit challenging/contentious and could benefit from mob-programming[0].<p>They are also useful to update team members who have been away or stuck in meetings, and for them to update the rest of the team. Not everyone can be in all conversations all the time.<p>As with most agile practices the mantra of &quot;If it hurts, do it more often&quot; applies well to standups. Synchronization is useful when working in this way but it shouldn&#x27;t need to be long and painful. Having multiple focused sub-5 minute standups is better than one that drags on.<p>e.g. break along functional lines. Limit morning chat to what are we doing today, who is working with whom?. Have separate sessions for updates on progress, discussing impediments, or product planning updates.<p>Informal &quot;huddles&quot; work quite well too. Convene everyone ad-hoc when there&#x27;s a decision to be made or as soon as an impediment arises.<p>When mob-programming most of the reasons for standups disappear. The whole team stays synchronized all the time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://mobprogramming.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobprogramming.org/</a>",1428471843

9338891,comment,9335441,9335441,0,0,kxyvr,,,"The lion in the room is that the DOE National Laboratories have a huge amount of code tied up in MPI and they continue to spend millions of dollars both on hardware and software to support this infrastructure.  If you look at the top 500 list:<p><a href=""http://www.top500.org/lists/2014/11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.top500.org/lists/2014/11/</a><p>Four out the ten computers are owned by DOE.  That&#x27;s a pretty significant investment, so they&#x27;re going to be reluctant to change over to a different system.  And, to be clear, a different software setup could be used on these systems, but they were almost certainly purchased with the idea that their existing MPI codes would work well on them.  Hell, MPICH was partially authored by Argonne:<p><a href=""http://www.mcs.anl.gov/project/mpich-high-performance-portable-implementation-mpi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcs.anl.gov/project/mpich-high-performance-portab...</a><p>so they&#x27;ve a vested interest in seeing this community stay consistent.<p>Now, on the technical merits, is it possible to do better?  Of course.  That being said, part of the reason that DOE invested so heavily in this infrastructure is that they often solve physics based problems based on PDE formulations.  Here, we&#x27;re basically using either a finite element, finite difference, or finite volume based method and it turns out that there&#x27;s quite a bit of experience writing these codes with MPI.  Certainly, GPUs have made a big impact on things like finite difference codes, but you still have to distribute data for these problems across a cluster of computers because they require too much memory to store locally.  Right now, this can be done in a moderately straight forward way with MPI.  Well, more specifically, people end up using DOE libraries like PETSc or Trilinos to do this for them and they&#x27;re based on MPI.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works and scales well.  Thus far, I&#x27;ve not seen anything that improves upon this enough to convince these teams to abandon their MPI infrastructure.<p>Again, this is not to say that this setup is perfect.  I also believe that this setup has caused a certain amount of stagnation (read huge amount) in the HPC community and that&#x27;s bad.  However, in order to convince DOE that there&#x27;s something better than MPI, someone has to put together some scalable codes that vastly outperform (or are vastly easier to use, code, or maintain) the problems that they care about.  Very specifically, these are PDE discretizations of continuum mechanics based problems using either finite different, finite element, or finite volume methods in 3D.  The 1-D diffusion problem in the article is nice, but 3-D is a pain in the ass, everyone knows it, and you can not get even a casual glance shy of 3-D problems.  That sucks and is not fair, but that&#x27;s the reality of the community.<p>By the way, the oil industry basically mirrors the sentiment of DOE as well.  They&#x27;re huge consumers of the same technology and the same sort of problems.  If someone is curious, check out reverse time migration or full wave inversion.  There are billions of dollars tied up in these two problems and they have a huge amount of MPI code.  If someone can solve these problems better using a new technology, there&#x27;s a huge amount of money in it.  So far, no one has done it because that&#x27;s a huge investment and hard.",1428470068

Using it as a laptop, the thing has one major bonus: with a fully charged dock and a fully charged tablet, I can get around 10-12 hours of use.<p>But in terms of programs I need to use every day, it's not very good. Apps are inconsistent about including keyboard shortcuts. There's sometimes a small delay when typing. I can have only one fullscreen window per app. The available office programs aren't very good (and I have to deal with docx/xlsx files every day). There's no decent version of LaTex. Using SSH is ok but that's not something I need to do very often. Using RDP to hook up with my office Windows box also works fairly well but I wouldn't want to do extended work that way. I guess for a use case which involves a lot of SSH and/or remote desktop, this might be a very good laptop due to the battery life.<p>Even though I don't own a Chromebook, I would suspect it's probably better as a laptop even with a reduced number of apps. Overlapping/tiling windows, keyboard shortcuts (presumably) for everything, better support for Google Docs. It only suffers by comparison in regards to the battery life.",1352757180

You can use this to break up your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts. The # character is also treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment, just as in ordinary Perl code. This also means that if you want real whitespace or # characters in the pattern (outside a character class, where they are unaffected by /x), then you'll either have to escape them (using backslashes or \Q...\E ) or encode them using octal, hex, or \N{} escapes.

4774968,comment,4773800,4773800,5,0,programminggeek,,,"What is interesting here is that if Samsung loses the Apple contract, it will have likely huge negative impacts on Samsung. Apple's huge parts purchasing has effectively bankrolled the R&D and overhead costs of Samsung's mobile operations for quite a while now. Thus, Samsung is able to use the same factories and parts in their own products cheaper than anyone else can because Apple's massive investments make it possible.<p>If Apple had HTC or LG making all of their parts, it would be much easier for LG and HTC to compete. Eventually, as Apple moves away from Samsung it will be interesting to see if Samsung can keep up with Apple as Apple's huge contract no longer pays for the massive production overhead and R&D costs for mobile tech.<p>My guess is over a 10 year period Samsung will lose a lot of its profitability advantage over other Android phone makers unless it can replace Apple's purchase volume their own sales.",1352756795

The law in most states in the USA(1) surely states that any damage you cause should be paid in recompense. So technically ""distracted driving"" is ""covered by existing law"". In practice this does not work out. Its easy to be in an accident that causes more damage than an individual's net worth and insurance coverage combined. If the only people allowed to drive cars were the ones able to afford enough insurance to guarantee recompense(2) in any situation, there would be very few cars on the road indeed. So sometimes existing laws need ""helping"", as imperfect as that may be. Society subsidizes the risk in exchange for a little cooperation to reduce that risk.<p>(1) Excepting all of that ""no fault"" nonsense that a few try to monkey-patch into working.<p>(2) It gets even more complicated when people die.",1352754420

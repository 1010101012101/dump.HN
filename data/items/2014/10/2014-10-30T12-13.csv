8532620,comment,8530819,8532213,0,0,orbifold,,,"I agree but there are different ways of going about it. In the particular case I know of, a police officer infiltrated all left leaning student organisations in order to get access to the more radical ones. By infiltrated I mean that he went to their meetings, was invited to parties and reported all their personal information. In any case, I just wanted to defuse the argument that the government is probably not that interested in your data. Its far easier to turn devices such as this against you, I mentioned the case where they recorded the phone numbers of every mobile device at a largely peaceful demonstration. Since there is no reason to ever delete this data, you not only have to trust that the current government is benevolent and reasonable, but also that this form of government is stable, does not crumble and you don&#x27;t end up on a kill list 20 years later. This might not be an issue in the West, but there are countless cases around the world, where based on much less information political activists / dissidents were murdered.",1414673948

Reading your comments it is very apparent that you take any mention of a belief in God to mean a follower of the American branch of reformist protestant Christianity with biblical literalism.<p>That is a <i>very</i> broad brush, as the fundamentalists literalists are a tiny part of Christianity and of broader monotheism. They make up about a quarter of American Christians, which is a much higher proportion than any other country in the world.<p>A lot of people associate that branch of Christianity with all monotheism simply because they tend to be noisy and dominate political issues. You&#x27;ll rarely find that view outside of the USA, and of the overall global monotheist population the literalists are a tiny percentage.<p>The biggest critics of the literalists and their views are in fact other Christians. Even the Catholic church, which itself is a conservative branch of Christianity - accepts evolution, the age of the universe and other dominant issues associated with fundamentalist Christians in the USA such as the rights of homosexuals.<p>To associate all Christians or monotheists as meaning fundamentalist is no different to the bigots and wackos who believe that all Muslims are Salafist jihadi. Tim mentioned nothing more than a belief in God, it is a <i>huge</i> and unsubstantiated leap to conclude from his single word that he is a fundamentalist literalist.<p>There would be a lot more tolerance in this world if people who hated at least understood what it was they were hating. I see your views as being as ignorant and fundamentalist as the very views you disagree with.",1414673915

Non-religious people would say this. It&#x27;s part of the common US vocabulary. The second is much more serious, and the speaker is actually thanking God for how he is. A non-religious person would never say it.<p>Religious people do this type of thing all the time in the US. Just look at 1 example- sports. The amount of American pro-athletes who are religious is astounding. Many athletes will seriously thank God after doing something well in a sporting event.<p>I&#x27;m very very anti-theist and I still have a lot of Christians on my Facebook, and some of them are constantly thanking God or praising Jesus for some good thing that happened in their life.<p>The amount of cars that have religious stickers on them is incredible. Crosses, the Jesus fish, some Biblical reference, a Christian brand, etc- you see them constantly. Maybe it&#x27;s not like that in the Bay Area, but that is an exception. I live in Germany now and I&#x27;ve counted a total of TWO cars in 2 years that had any kind of Religious sticker.<p>So, yeah, Christianity is everywhere in the US.

In 1981, electronic spreadsheets were just coming into their own, and the kind of sophisticated modeling Stockman did was still done chiefly on mainframe computers. The output he was working with wasn’t in the now-familiar spreadsheet format; instead, the formulas appeared in one place and the results in another. You could see what you were getting. That cannot be said of electronic spreadsheets, which don’t display the formulas that govern their calculations.</i><p>This is the real double-edged sword of spreadsheets. They simultaneously surface data, logic and presentation. This enables a very fluid modelling process because you can see everything that&#x27;s happening... at first.

Instinctive drives
Emotional/limbic experiences
Locational (physical mapping)
Memory-based/learned
Abstract/intellectual/symbolic<p>Consciousness is another kind of experience which adds a symbol that works a bit like JavaScript&#x27;s &#x27;this&#x27;, and seems to create a level of experiential indirection - so instead of sensing something directly, you experience how it affects the &#x27;this&#x27; symbol. It seems to do this by abstracting the experience and simultaneously comparing it with an associative database of previous experiences, using all of the circuits in the list. (And probably others too - I won&#x27;t pretend this is a complete model.)<p>You need some basic ability to abstract to have a &#x27;this.&#x27; The better you are at it, the more bandwidth passes through the experience/memory/abstraction/future prediction/new memories system.<p>Simpler animals have basic input circuitry, and they learn instinctively without abstraction.<p>But... I&#x27;d guess surprisingly many animals of all kinds have a &#x27;this&#x27; network. The human advantages are a &#x27;this&#x27; network with more bandwidth, a much improved ability to learn from experiential invariants, an ability to make useful predictions, and an ability to store and communicate &#x27;this&#x27; experiences using external technologies.<p>If this sketch is accurate, consciousness doesn&#x27;t have to be mysterious. But it also doesn&#x27;t depend on a simple connection count.<p>The Internet won&#x27;t be conscious because it has no &#x27;this&#x27; network. It has no pain/pleasure circuits, no emotional circuits, and no instinctive drives. But most of all it has no ability to compare memories with current experiences and to abstract learning from that. There are systems - like Google search - which have incredibly basic precursors to abstraction/learning/prediction. But they still mostly run on a batch basis with input->processing->output, and no explicit self-concept state memory.<p>My guess is that if you built a system from these elements and included the current state of the art - or better - machine learning, machine vision, and natural language elements, with useful analogs of instinctive drives and the other animal fundamentals, you&#x27;d potentially have something that at least acted and sounded conscious, and would likely do some unexpected things. (Which is one of the practical ways we think we recognise consciousness. Conscious entities are <i>hard to model</i>. In fact we&#x27;re probably easier to model than we think we are, but face to face, consciousness in other people usually implies surprises.)<p>Whether or not it would be truly self-aware or just pretending is a question that&#x27;s impossible to answer without resorting to metaphysics.",1414672076

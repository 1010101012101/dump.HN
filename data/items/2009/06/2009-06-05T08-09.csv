642929,story,,,3,3,dageroth,"Patents question - territorial limits in the internet",,"I am curently researching a few patents since our company is considering to make the leap and attract some american companies as customers. We are providing a web analytics solution which works by putting a pixel into the  website to be tracked. Said pixel is stored on our servers in Europe. Now I wonder how patents on webanalytics are applicable, when they are filed in the United States. Our company would not operate an office there, we do not even have servers there. The client computers would receive their pixel from europe and an american company would access a frontend in europe or collect data via SOAP.<p>If we now attract american customers and provide stats for american websites are we then suddenly violating patents, because they are american? I don't understand how the international fences are drawn and before we start setting out to the american market we certainly will ask a lawyer, but my experiences with lawyers were rather bad when it came to such technical and complicated issues they rarely understand. So if anyone of you has some reasonsable speculations to offer or could point me to a source or a case, let me know.",1244192302

642920,comment,642677,642781,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Gunfire may be a little extreme, but we should consider carefully allowing a person like this to continue to work for the city. There's a certain attitude that pervades the lower echelons of public service that entices people to beat up the helpless with the letter of the law. They pretend that they're doing good by ""enforcing city ordinances"" and then smugly refuse even to tell the poor guy which building to go to because its ""not their job"".<p>This is evil (little e). We'd be better off with the position they fill being vacant. Should they ignore the law altogether? Certainly not, but we employ humans so that it can be enforced with intelligence and compassion. I have a suspicion that those who would engage in this kind of cruel enforcement on the low end are the first to give favors to the wealthy on the flip side. That's just what corruption looks like from the bottom.",1244191617

642902,comment,642671,642868,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"Virus is Latin for poison. It's a mass noun because it denotes something uncountable (not in the strict mathematical sense, but in the how the hell do you count poison sense). As far as I know, there is no Latin plural form for virus.<p>Second declension singular nominative nouns end in 'us' and their plural form end in 'i', but fourth declension singular nominative nouns also end in 'us', but their plural form still end in 'us'. Also, like in every language, there are funky exceptions to these rules, like second declension singular nominative nouns which are neuter rather than masculine, but still end in 'us' rather than the normal 'um'. Moral of the story, don't assume that the plural of word ending in 'us' is 'i'.<p>It's also been about 8 years since I've taken Latin, so take that into consideration before someone goes all Life of Brian on me.",1244190198
642901,comment,642726,642726,0,0,koepked,,,"gaius already made this point, but I wanted to make it again as a comment rather than a reply to head in a different direction: <i>Unions</i> are the problem. When crappy educators rise through the ranks to become department heads based on literally nothing more than seniority and a union contract, the education system has failed.<p>As far as salary increases, what good would that do? Because of the <i>unions</i>, crappy teachers would recieve the same increase. Not only that, there would me MORE crappy teachers; $125k is definitely enough to attract people who don't want really want to teach. Good teachers teach for the same reason good programers program: it's what they love to do, it's what they were made to do, there is no other life. Money isn't everything. I'm not saying the rewards shouldn't match the benefit given by a good teacher, but again, the <i>union</i> prevents this.",1244190123

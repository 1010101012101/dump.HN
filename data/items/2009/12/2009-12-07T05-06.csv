980805,comment,980805,980703,0,0,crux_,,,"> The problem is that the grant funded climate scientists all get more funding if they raise more alarm about global warming.<p>This is often asserted, but is it true? Most alarmism that I have seen is coming from the media or activist organizations; the few times I've seen scientist alarm has been when recent measurements have been worse in some way than their models predict.<p>Further, let's assume the funding relationship is true. Are all these scientists that dishonest? Wouldn't honest ones be reigning in their colleagues? Why haven't we seen this?<p>>  Even more concerning, the distribution of grants, the peer review process, and the IPCC process are controlled by people like Mann and Phil Jones who study the issue like lawyers prosecuting a case, not like scientists proving a case.<p>They're expected to present and defend their claims in the court of public opinion and in the realm of politics; why are you shocked and appalled that they are doing so?<p>N.b. they're rather incompetent at public relations, unfortunately...<p>>  Climate science has the same selection of the process as a priesthood, and that kind of selection process will produce the same errors as a religion.<p>Sure. So does astrophysics, evolutionary biology, ... How is the situation different from any other deep speciality?<p>> So all we hear about is a ""consensus"" when that consensus is really just a self-replicating group of believers.<p>Or, a consensus opinion under attack by politically motivated non-scientists. What test could be applied, or evidence provided, to tell the difference?",1260165250

There isn't any proof whatsoever that current human beings are fixed in ""general intelligence"" as soon as their genome is fixed. Rather, there is entire agreement among all researchers that each human being's neurological characteristics are shaped both by genome and by experience--on this point no informed person has any doubt.<p><i>I also think that we will not do this complex and interesting topic justice if we discuss it here.</i><p>You are welcome to speak for yourself on that issue, of course. But on my part, I have observed that there are some HN readers who do their homework on genetic and environmental influences on human intelligence before expressing opinions on those issues, and I have learned from some of those participants and so could anyone else who cares to read their comments.<p><i>I did not mention the Intelligence Quotient (which is subject to boosting).

That's not insubstantial by any means, but it also means that that revenue isn't terribly useful for building your next project (this is again a simplification, as the situation changes when you have more than one app bringing in that stream, etc etc).<p>So yea, I didn't mean for it to sound quite so dramatic, like the app store doesn't have any tail at all, because that's not really true.

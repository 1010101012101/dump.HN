We could get the sensor id and maybe the tire id (depending on the type of TPMS system). We had access to the VIN in our flash, as well as access to it over the CAN bus from a number of sources. I&#x27;d expect that you would have a very difficult time measuring random vehicles sensor ids and readings if they&#x27;re just driving by because of how low throughput the system was.",1428436785

From my point of view, research science was becoming a luxury/hobby profession of people whose spouses make a lot of money or who are independently wealthy.<p>The only two solutions I see are either funding for NIH and basic sciences drastically increases (my preferred solution), or there is some breakthrough which makes biotech and life sciences industry more profitable and able to hire all the entry level PhDs.<p>Notice how the engineering and physics PhDs make up only a small fraction of the donut chart? That&#x27;s because those folks graduate with skills that are desirable to industry because they can translate into profit. The biotech industry does not need smart and inexperienced idea people.

If you&#x27;re going to outsource a division, then lay off your pregnant women along with the rest of the workers that are going to be part of that lay off.  Singling out a single pregnant woman for a pre-emptive firing, separate from the rest of her coworkers, reeks of discrimination and should rightly be cause for lawsuit.<p>> You would be surprised how many employers are afraid to boost female/minority hiring because they are afraid of opening themselves up to lawsuits if the need to let that person go in the future.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be, actually, because people in general tend to hold onto unfounded ideas.

Maybe $10k more after 10 years. These are, mostly, people who took out loans to achieve a PhD in a true STEM field...you know, the EXACT professional area that a great number of political / economic / intellectual &quot;leaders&quot; say we need to further support.<p>Yet there&#x27;s the persistent decline in NIH funding, money going to &quot;safe&quot; research topics (as in, no room to grow the field, just backing winners), and the looming shadow of arrangements where publicly funded research is channelled into private or otherwise &quot;protected&quot; areas. The glut of post docs is basically the symptom of this disease that is ruining a professional, highly skilled field. According to the article, the recommendations put forward recently are similar to the ones mentioned 15 years ago - so, the problem was ignored then / kicked down the road - and now we&#x27;re on the cusp of a gigantic pile of non-performing student loans because there&#x27;s no work to be had to earn an income and repay the loans that were taken out in pursuit of work.<p>It&#x27;s really too bad. This is no easy conundrum, not at all. What&#x27;s the best advice? If you&#x27;re looking into bench science as a career, DON&#x27;T. Become a veterenarian. Go into geriatric nursing.

I&#x27;d like to use these, and in fact be able to tell keybase.io that I have more than just social web proof that these are who they say they are.<p>- Ability to use email addresses instead of just keybase names when referring to users.<p>- Autocomplete when typing handles/emails on the client&#x27;s command line. Using the Node client currently without this feature.<p>- When I tried to encrypt a file using keybase recently, it gave me an obscure error (#100) instead of telling me that I was logged out.<p>- encrypt should not silently create a new file by default. It should not overwrite an existing file either. Do `keybase encrypt joe@example.com foo.txt` twice, and have foo.txt.acs overwritten the second time. Instead by default it should output to stdout, and let you specify a file as an optional argument.<p>- Lastly, and this is way outside the scope of what keybase currently does, I&#x27;d love a built-in tool for exchanging encrypted files. Currently, I use chunk.io + curl + gpg to do this:<p><pre><code>    function send-encrypted() {
       gpg -o - -aer &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$1&quot; | curl -T - http://chunk.io
    }
</code></pre>
I am not suggesting that you guys host any type of file sharing tool, but perhaps integration with a service like chunk.io or similar would be nice.

(Never mind that I got accepted but didn&#x27;t attend due to better financial aid elsewhere.)</i><p>I didn&#x27;t go to college at all, and I&#x27;ve been invited to interview there by engineering managers. If I didn&#x27;t have absolute golden handcuffs at my current job, I might have considered it.<p>Furthermore, I know plenty of people who haven&#x27;t gone to any college and work at Google. If you don&#x27;t hear back, it has nothing to do with the college you went to. Even if a single interviewer had this bias against you, the larger hiring committee would review each of the interviews you had with different people.<p>To name a couple of examples - David Byttow, founder of Secret, was hired as a Software Engineer at Google without any degree. Michal Zalewski is in an engineering director role without a degree. Once you reach the interview, the sole reason for a hire/no-hire decision is how you did in the interview process. Literally nothing on your résumé will disbar you at that point.<p><i>>> 2) If they do decide to interview me, I won&#x27;t hear about it for months.</i><p>You won&#x27;t hear about the interview date for months? I admit this can be frustrating for large companies, but no one I&#x27;ve spoken to told me it literally lasted months. The longest I&#x27;ve heard of was a month and a half, from first interview to hearing news.<p>How are you submitting your résumé? Are you just applying to the job and hoping for a recruiter to pick it up, or actually emailing a hiring manager at Google? If you apply without trying to get the attention of a decision maker it always takes longer because that&#x27;s how the process works at large companies.<p><i>>> 3) I&#x27;ll have to drill on data structures and efficiency of sorting algorithms I&#x27;ve literally never implemented outside of an interview or academic setting.</i><p>While algorithmic questions are asked, they do not make up the entirety of the technical interviews at Google. Generally speaking from what I have seen, questions are not &quot;implement a linked list&quot;, questions are &quot;implement this program&quot; and you are free to choose which algorithm is best. However, I acknowledge that interviewers might not always follow this.<p><i>>> 4) Even having drilled on those arbitrary questions, I&#x27;ll likely fail the interview because after a multi-day gauntlet of questions a random engineer didn&#x27;t like the particular assumptions I put into my Fermi model of golf balls.</i><p>Fermi questions are actively discouraged by the Hiring Committee, and questions involving these will be thrown out when evaluating an interviewer&#x27;s analysis of an employee. As someone elsewhere in the thread mentioned, this would involve a strongly worded email from the Hiring Committee afterwards.<p>The first thing to understand about Google&#x27;s hiring process is that you are interviewed onsite using five or so 1:1 sessions. The interviewer has to perfectly transcribe everything that happens and needs to be able to explain their decision to the Hiring Committee. The Hiring Committee will not consider answers from an interviewer like, &quot;He couldn&#x27;t tell me how many stoplights are in Los Angeles&quot; or answers like &quot;He didn&#x27;t give a good enough answer about why he wants to work here.&quot;<p>I realize this seems like &quot;my anecdata is better than your anecdata&quot;, but what are you saying is actively negative and contrary to a lot of the literature about what Google&#x27;s hiring practices. I&#x27;m not saying their hiring practices are perfect - far from it. But you seem to be ascribing malice to their methodology when it&#x27;s really not the case.",1428434270

9336341,comment,9335441,9336174,0,0,na85,,,"I spent a few months learning (modern) Fortran a year or two ago.  My chief obstacle was the difficulty involved in finding modern tutorials.  I don&#x27;t want to have to read tutorials written in 1994 whose focus is getting people used to F77 up to speed.  I&#x27;ve yet to find a tutorial that approached teaching F08 as if it was a new language, which is what I feel is needed.<p>Even in F08 there&#x27;s a lot of backwards-compatibility cruft still left in the language, too.  The IO model still provides very little abstraction and is based on tape drives.  You can/have to &quot;rewind&quot; files.  There are obscure &quot;unit descriptors&quot; that manifest themselves as integer literals in most code posted online which makes it a chore to learn from.  As far as I can tell there is no functionality that approximates the behaviour of C++&#x27;s streams.<p>It&#x27;s fast as hell, and the GNU compiler is mature and well-developed, but Fortran remains a horrid language for doing any sort of interactive programming.  It&#x27;s best used if you just give it some arguments, let it run free, and then have it return some object or value that a more sane language can then interpret and present to the user for a decision.<p>There is little reason to learn a language where the only sane choice for doing input/output involves calling your Fortran module from a python script and letting the python handle i/o.",1428433843

9336335,comment,9333330,9335304,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;ve talked to a couple lawyers about this and their advice, somewhat surprisingly, was that you don&#x27;t need to incorporate until you&#x27;re past the &quot;project&quot; stage.  Specifically:<p>1.) You&#x27;re handling money.  As soon as money&#x27;s involved your liability goes up significantly - plus, the corporation needs its own bank account.<p>2.) You have investors.  They need an entity to be able to invest.<p>3.) You need the business to continue if one of the people involved backs out.  If you&#x27;re a few guys in a garage, your startup is probably screwed if any of you back out, and so having a formal shareholder agreement and property owned by the corporation doesn&#x27;t really gain you anything.  If you&#x27;re an operating unincorporated business with something of value and your tech cofounder backs out, he holds the business hostage, because he owns the IP.<p>4.) You&#x27;re doing anything that&#x27;s risky and may piss people off, eg. spammy marketing campaigns, crashing peoples&#x27; conventions, abusing another company&#x27;s API, scraping data where the ownership is unclear.  You can get a lot of protection from lawsuits simply by not pissing people off; people who aren&#x27;t mad at you and don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve wronged them don&#x27;t sue you.  But if you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s a grey area, you really really don&#x27;t want your personal assets at risk.<p>The main downside of incorporating is that then you have to deal with all the administrative details of being a corporation.  You have to pay yourself minimum wage, or else you&#x27;re in violation of minimum wage laws.  You&#x27;re taxed on the income you receive as wages (even though it&#x27;s just a transfer from yourself to yourself), so the IRS is taking 15% or so of your runway off the top.  You have to file both corporate and individual taxes, which is a big distraction when you want to be working on your product.  You need to have at least nominal board meetings (in the beginning, this can be just you and your cofounder sitting down at the table), where minutes are kept.  It also costs a few hundred in fees, which is money you don&#x27;t get back if the startup never finds any customers (as most don&#x27;t).<p>Basically - you can and should be &quot;just a person working on a project&quot; when you&#x27;re building.  When you release it to the world and let people who you don&#x27;t personally know use it, it&#x27;s probably time to incorporate.",1428433804

And so we are bound by it as long as that consensus stays. (Or we opt out of democracy, which certain SV nutcases are certainly considering)<p>You might make many other points about the social contract that are valid, like e.g. the scarcity of work, the unsustainability of current society, etc. I think we need to address them, and I think the social contract will change significantly in the next 30 years.<p>But as it is right now, that&#x27;s why employers should support people who have children.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract</a>

Doing this means you miss talking to some interesting people. But be upfront that you&#x27;re not that co-founder so no-one feels like their time is wasted.<p>This is a good point. I suspect many people here have grown tired of hearing &quot;dude I have this idea for an app...&quot; I just graduated from college and many of my nontechnical friends who went into finance are realizing they hate it and want to get into tech startups. During college I was always busy so I shrugged off these conversations. Now I have time to listen, and it turns out, many of them actually do have good ideas and business models. They just don&#x27;t know how to code them. But these are smart, well connected people who can raise money. Dismissing their ideas is foolish and could certainly be a waste.<p>I realized I can monetize all my friends asking me to help with apps. I have a team of programmers I&#x27;ve worked with overseas, and I know how to manage them to complete projects. I&#x27;ve started offering a service to my friends where I take them from idea to MVP (usually a basic CRUD web app). I translate ideas to technical requirements, write a spec, divide it into milestones, negotiate payment schedule, and manage the project to completion. I structure the price per milestone so that my team is rewarded for hitting deadlines, e.g. Milestone X (some subset of feature requirements) pays $1000 by 4/31, or $1500 by 4/24. This has worked well for me in the past and is a good way to keep projects on schedule.<p>I just started doing this, and I&#x27;ve gotten a new lead or two each week so far. None have been serious enough about the idea yet to immediately execute, but I suspect with some pressure applied they will be ready.<p>I spoke to an alumnus from my school who graduated 3 years ago and did this in an official capacity. He started a &quot;product development consultancy&quot; wih a hybrid employee/outsource model, and tapped his alumni network for projects. His company completed 39 projects in its first year, all sourced from networking.<p>If you are an engineer also blessed with a strong network and interpersonal skills, I suggest you look into this as well. You don&#x27;t need to code every app that someone wants help with. Often you can help give direction, or even charge for your services of managing an overseas team. People who leave finance are a good match because they can raise funds to the point that you can offer cheap, quality service from a friend, but also pay your developers way more than median salary in their country. I think of it like arbitraging my networks and skillsets.<p>Regardless of whether you do that, I definitely recommend putting an end to the habit of ignoring the app ideas of your friends.",1428433647

MPI hasn&#x27;t been updated in ages, I don&#x27;t think that necessarily means we need to ditch it, it just means the standard needs to be modernized. I don&#x27;t feel very strongly about this since working with MPI is a huge pain in the ass and it seems like the challenge of modernizing it is just gargantuan.<p>Also I&#x27;m not familiar with spark, but isn&#x27;t Chapel a decade old at this point and barely works at all?

Because they are now not people, the DA has no problem throwing every single possible crime against them. This means they are not prosecuted for much more than what they did. &quot;Going easy&quot; on criminals is not a good way to retain a position in government in the US, so we do the opposite.<p>It is interesting to note that the judge made good comments about how unjust this seemed, but was unable to do anything about it.

7219024,comment,7218216,7218782,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Don&#x27;t repeating patterns increase the likelihood that the pattern is non-random with each repetition?<p>1. No, not for finite-length patterns anyway.<p>2. Your question is deeper than it appears, and it alludes to some complex theories about randomness.<p>Let&#x27;s say I present a series of decimal digits that is a million digits long, and I claim that they&#x27;re random, in this context meaning they have no exploitable internal order (i.e. have high entropy). If you understand the risks in making assumptions about randomness, and in spite of all sorts of apparent non-random sequences within the list, you might say, &quot;the list isn&#x27;t long enough to draw any conclusion about randomness.&quot; And you would be right.<p>My million-digit list might actually be a sequence of digits of Pi starting at some arbitrary point within Pi and extending for a million digits from that point. The list appears random, but it isn&#x27;t -- it actually has very low entropy.<p>On that basis, guess how many digits you would need to be assured that they represent a random sequence? Spoiler: an infinite number.<p>All the principles that apply to a claim of randomness, apply to a claim of non-randomness, and for the same reasons.<p>> I am not a statistician but I do have a fair amount of background in things like information theory, and I find it very hard to believe that regularity has zero significance.<p>Okay. If I flip a fair, unbiased coin and record all the flips, counting heads as 1 and tails as zero, over time I will see any number of apparently significant patterns, and the longer the sequence, the more likely that I will see &quot;significance&quot;.<p>In a long sequence of flips of a fair coin, for any particular sequence of length n to have >= 50% probability requires 2^n flips. For example, this means after 256 flips, the chance for an uninterrupted sequence of 8 heads has risen above 50%. Therein lies the problem -- with a large enough data set, you will see all sorts of meaningless patterns.<p>The only way to sort this kind of thing out is to:<p>1. Adopt the &quot;null hypothesis&quot; -- meaning start out assuming that a correlation means nothing, then gather evidence to contradict that assumption. In other words, don&#x27;t start out by assuming what you must prove.<p>2. Consider alternative explanations for the tested outcome -- avoid confirmation bias.<p>3. Remember <i>lex parsimoniae</i>, otherwise known as &quot;Occam&#x27;s razor&quot;, the precept that the simplest explanation tends to be correct. And the simplest explanation is that a pattern that lacks an explanation, also lacks significance.<p>In the final analysis, one cannot make any reliable statement about a data pattern without knowing how the sequence was generated, in other words the result data ultimately has no meaning, only knowledge of the generating function can offer that kind of significance.<p>> If you output digits of pi long enough, they will contain this text.<p>Yes, but that&#x27;s an argument against the meaning of perceived patterns, not in favor of it.",1392141372

People simply loved the game, and they couldn&#x27;t get enough of clearing boards of dots, power-pellets and ghosts.<p>Most people probably knew nothing about who made the game, with the small exception of the corporate names on the game (e.g., Namco/Midway). Certainly, I suspect only the hardcore few would be able to name the programmer of Pac-Man, Shigeo Funaki. And I suspect that no one blinked their eyes in disdain when they saw the news reports of Pac-Man&#x27;s financial success.<p>In a similar way, Flappy Bird took very simple game-play, and combined it with a simple challenge. This is, of course, not the first game to do this, but it took off so successfully that I suspect that a very high percentage of gamers have it installed, and even some non-gamers could likely brand-identify the game, or have at least heard of it. The power of the Internet has made Nguyen&#x27;s name known, and quite sadly in some circles, despised for his financial success.<p>No one bemoaned Pac-Man&#x27;s programmer, or Namco/Midway&#x27;s success, but fast-forward from the 80s to today, and you get gems like this article [1] and its intellectual lamenting with, <i>&quot;[...] I begrudge a society that would turn it into a phenomenon.&quot;</i><p>I suspect that the author would have said the same about Pac-Man.<p>Casual games like Flappy Bird do not prevent someone from playing, say, EVE Online, to their heart&#x27;s content. And, what if you just happen to like <i>both</i> types of games? I guess you are a real outcast at that point; a non-intellectual. To put it another way, just because you intellectually eschew casual games and choose instead to rock, say, Steel Battalion with a full-on controller [2] doesn&#x27;t mean that you are necessarily leading the upliftment of society.<p>Fortunately, there is a game in the world for every gamer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/02/03/flappy-bird-review-winged-fury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/02/03/flappy-bir...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Steel_Battalion_controllers.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Steel_Ba...</a>",1392141007

The thing is, though, that a <i>lot</i> of Republican primary voters support the Tea Party&#x27;s message of lower taxes, limited government, and a return to constitutional norms -- to the extent that they&#x27;re willing to toss out an incumbent, which loses DC seniority and risks having an even-worse Democrat elected instead. That&#x27;s trading short-term costs for long-term benefits.<p>It&#x27;s not yet clear whether R and D primary voters care enough about NSA surveillance to vote out incumbents on those grounds alone.

To take an example of Republicans taking the federal side and Democrats taking the more subsidiary side of an issue, about 10 years back there was an interesting point in Wisconsin state politics where municipalities were starting to enact bans on smoking in taverns, and some folks in the state legislature responded by attempting to enact a statewide ban on smoking bans.<p>Of course, smoking in bars still became illegal statewide about 3 years ago. . . which I think illustrates the real guiding principle in American politics, which is political pragmatism:  Election season politicking (read: dishonesty) aside, neither party truly takes a principled stance on the big government issue.  In practice, they freely flip-flop between pushing big-government policies and stumping for smaller governments&#x27; right to be free from meddling depending on which approach better suits their goals in a particular situation.<p>To take another example, the two main parties&#x27; relative opinions on the desirability of using great heaping piles of taxpayer money to fund government programs in order to create jobs does this sudden, dramatic and complete inversion when the topic of military contractors gets raised.",1392140185

Legalize drugs.  Allow local municipalities to regulate and tax recreational substances.  Boom. You have an instant local revenue stream, the police are suddenly out of the business of arresting people for &quot;possession&quot;, and can focus more on violent crime, domestic disturbances, etc.  In the short term, drug-funded gangs will turn to theft and robbery to stay in business, but anyway a major, relatively safe and easy source of revenue will be gone.<p>2. Declare certain urban areas to be economic development zones with drastically reduced taxes and regulations.  Make it dirt cheap to locate factories and plants there.  Provide start-up grants to local entrepreneurs, with real oversight, not just feel-good handouts.  Lower the barriers to business start-ups and there will be business activity, and it will accelerate as the cycle of crime and poverty is reduced.<p>3. Fix the K-12 schools.  Double the teachers&#x27; pay, double the security around the schools and provide secure bus rides to and from the projects and tenements.  Make the school day longer, and ratchet up the standards.  Demand higher achievement, and don&#x27;t let a kid just flunk and walk away; make them re-take, make them realize the importance.  Make school a destination, not a chore.<p>Teach democracy in the schools.  Emphasize basic literacy skills, ethics and morality, history, how to speak and write properly, mathematics and science.  Make the schools the best in the state in terms of standards.<p>These are all easier said than done, but can we afford to do anything less?

This creates some problems for the GC, as it can&#x27;t be sure what objects are live and which aren&#x27;t. For example, a pointer might point to unallocated memory (in which case the GC must not even dereference it), to a `malloc`-allocated memory, to a GC-allocated memory, or even in the middle of a (GC-allocated or `malloc`-allocated) heap object! In addition, some pointers look like integers and some integers look like pointers, and the GC has no idea how to distinguish them at runtime. In order to still support some kind of GC in such languages, you can write your GC to be <i>imprecise</i> or <i>conservative</i>, which means that it treats every integer that <i>could potentially</i> be a pointer as a pointer and assumes it is pointing to a live object. Potentially, this means that the GC thinks objects are live which are actually not, just because the programmer is using an integer which, if interpreted as a pointer, points to said object.<p>I&#x27;m not intimately familiar with Go implementation, but I assume that they haven&#x27;t bothered implementing precise stack- and register-scanning, which means that the runtime cannot distinguish pointers from integers on the stack/in the registers.

I am not sure exactly what it means and I&#x27;m not sure the obvious interpretations that most people would have are correct, but it definitely argues for some sort of pulsing macro business cycle.<p>My own hypothesis is that gold&#x27;s value vs. paper/stocks is a decent indicator of &quot;fear&quot; -- people flock to commodities like gold, silver, and real estate, as well as to bonds, etc. when they don&#x27;t believe the market is sound. Thus gold&#x27;s value rises during these times relative to paper currency, which depresses the value of the stock market when priced in gold. During times of hope/exuberance, the opposite occurs. People flee static investments for dynamic ones. Who wants to own a lump of metal when the markets are hot?<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a really big macroeconomic &quot;growth story&quot; since 1999, thus this graph.<p>If the pattern continues, this graph argues the same thing. Given that this is a repeating and established pattern, it&#x27;s a much stronger argument than the correlation in the original article up top. It argues that we have not yet &quot;hit bottom&quot; in the current macro cycle and that one more crash of some sort lies in the near future before the economy resets itself for the next growth cycle.<p>(Argues, but does not prove, of course.)",1392138745

All you need is the capability to escalate from a remote buffer overflow in the baseband processor (e.g. in its networking stack) into a flashrom r/w capability.<p>Then you just reprogram the bb firmware to never switch off the baseband and to automatically start it upon insertion of a battery, and you&#x27;re done. If you&#x27;re good, intercept PIN usage so that you&#x27;ll even be online without the user inputting the PIN.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;the NSA doesn&#x27;t have an 0day exploit yet for the new processor that comes with the phone&quot; argument.

But that&#x27;s still only part of the equation: we need to have deterrences <i>and</i> corrections in the same way that there&#x27;s preventative medicine <i>and</i> treatment.<p>Even for violent crimes, I don&#x27;t think that locking people up should be the <i>only</i> response. Victim-centered approaches, like restorative justice circles for example, could and should be used more where applicable. The victim is mostly left out of the equation in our current justice system. We should also try to view instances of violence not as deliberate evil actions taken by people, but instead culminations of bad circumstances and bad choices. This is not to say there shouldn&#x27;t be repercussions for the bad choices, but we should also offer support and rehabilitation to try to improve the circumstances.<p>Of course, there will always be the people who are beyond rehabilitation. Even then, for these kinds of people, &#x27;prison&#x27; doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.. &#x27;mental institution&#x27; seems more appropriate.<p>On [1], I don&#x27;t support the death penalty because there are so many errors made in sentencing. Even if we managed to make the error rate much lower, I personally don&#x27;t think the cost of innocent lives would be worth the potential extra deterrence the threat of death provides over life imprisonment. Hell, even if the rate were 0%, I still wouldn&#x27;t support it for moral reasons.",1401335937

Buried within it, there was a small but striking detail: By September 2004, the NSA had developed a technique that was dubbed “The Find” by special operations officers. The technique, the Post reports, was used in Iraq and “enabled the agency to find cellphones even when they were turned off.” This helped identify “thousands of new targets, including members of a burgeoning al-Qaeda-sponsored insurgency in Iraq,” according to members of the special operations unit interviewed by the Post.&quot;<p>And possibly capture data...<p>&quot;The FBI&#x27;s use, in which cell phones&#x27; microphones were remotely activated to record conversations (even with the phones turned off), probably had some bearing on Snowden&#x27;s request that journalists power down their phones and place them in the fridge. &quot;",1401335932

Out of the last 7 Olympic 100m mens finals all 56 finalists have been of West African descent. Only 2 out of the top 500 100m race times are by people without African descent.<p>Case closed? No. The proportion of sprint wins by West Africans is much higher than the prevalence of the ACTN3 gene would explain, and other power sports (notably weight lifting) are dominated by other ethnic groups with a more average distribution of the gene.<p>Distance running: The Kalenjin tribe (mostly from Kenya) has dominated distance running since the late 1990s. Most of their competition has come from Ethiopian runners and the occasional North African (especially in the women&#x27;s events)[2].<p>They do have a genetic advantage: they tend to be very skinny, with long legs and short torsos. But you can find these attributes in any population group. More surprising is that elite non-African runners performance has <i>decreased</i> over time: For example, of the top 10 Marathon times by British athletes only 1 (in 8th position) is since 2000, and 6 are pre 1990 (including the 2 fastest times).<p>This indicates something else is going on, that can&#x27;t just be explained by genetics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTN3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTN3</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/road-running/marathon/outdoor/men/senior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/road-running/marathon/o...</a> - the best place  person without a African heritige is Ronaldo Da Costa at 57.",1401334779

That&#x27;d be especially true if it had a lot of users.<p>That&#x27;s what makes me think that if this isn&#x27;t some elaborate scheme it&#x27;s likely the result of some sort of legal requirement or action (e.g. Lavabit) which would preclude the author(s) from doing anything else with the software. It&#x27;s a shame they couldn&#x27;t take a scorched earth-esque approach of dumping everything in the public domain, including notes on <i>why</i> this was happening, everyone else be damned, but I&#x27;d imagine their entire career might be in jeopardy at that point (and possibly their freedom).",1401334227

Every time I read Graham Greene, there are these terse sentences which leave me with admiration for his observation into human nature, and his masterly sardonic sarcasm - e.g. &quot;I am easily moved to anger by cruelties not mine own&quot; [ A Sort of Life ], or when describing how assurance in youth ends in doubts later &quot;even our handwriting begins young and takes on the tired arabesques of time&quot; [ The End of the Affair ], the sentences stay in your memory long after you&#x27;ve read them, and you see that pithy phrases can carry a world of experience behind them. Another great sentence - &quot;We live as we dream - alone&quot; [Conrad, Heart of Darkness]<p>Literature may be considered boring because it takes patience to appreciate, but I think it is neither primitive nor plain. If some programming reaches the level of art, as in a clever hack, maybe we can tell others about the beauty of the solution. (G. H. Hardy says that &quot;Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not&quot;.

Since the molester was my dad I could never escape him, could never go to my parent for help. He kept it up for the first 12 years of my life (he told me he started when I was 2 months old). He also did this to my sister and forced us to engage in incestuous behavior to boot. The end result was that we were utterly unprepared for normal, caring, relationships.<p>I, a shy, weak, easily intimidated young man, reacted very poorly and became the opposite of my father. Unfortunately he is a hard charging, successful go-getter that is considered &quot;Mr. Capable&quot; so I became a slacking, stress avoiding &quot;Mr. Loser&quot;. My sister, on the other hand, adopted all of his good traits, earning 2 PhDs from top schools and forging a career as a very highly paid scientist living a luxurious life in LA (and I was the &quot;smart&quot; one, lol). Thing is, we were both damaged quite badly, both attempted suicide, both suffering from debilitating depression, PTSD symptoms, etc.<p>My salvation, such as it is, came in the form of a loving wife who has nurtured me when needed and helped me grow into a more normal mode of living (this led to me teaching myself to program and finally, at age 45, earning a pretty decent living doing it). She cushioned the things that trigger me, guided me in making correct choices and basically taught me, over the almost 20 years we have been married, to be &quot;normal&quot; and I truly believe she saved my life. Her kindness and understanding has allowed my PTSD symptoms to fade over the years and minimized them when they do appear.<p>In three words, love saved me.<p>p.s. if you are a parent and have the sorts of feelings my father did towards us I beg of you to seek help. Please understand that acting on those desires will result in the harming and potential destruction of your children and the utter obliteration of your parent/child relationship.

7814482,comment,7814005,7814368,12,0,scottjad,,,"Kale by itself exceeds that list of nutrients for almost every nutrient that I could find data for. For many nutrients it blows it out of the water. It also likely includes many unknown beneficial phytonutrients that are not included in Soylent.<p>Also, from what I understand many of the benefits of these nutrients are diminished or not observed when they are injested from industrial refined supplements like those used in Soylent as when they are eaten in whole plant foods like Kale.<p>The five nutrients where Kale had less were Sodium, Selenium, Pantothenic acid, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12. Kale&#x27;s Sodium was still 127% of the RDA, Selenium was 82% of the RDA, and Pantothenic acid was 91% of the RDA. Not bad for a single plant. I suspect that in a well-rounded whole plant diet these deficiencies would be resolved. If you grow your own Kale then you will make plenty of Vitamin D :) If you don&#x27;t make enough then you can supplement Vitamin D like millions of animal-eating humans do. B12 is not included in plants, so obviously if you eat only plants you need to supplement it. It costs less than US$0.01/day so I don&#x27;t see that as a major problem.<p>I&#x27;m highly suspicious that you will find many nutritionists who would say that Soylent is more nutritious than a diet of whole plant foods.<p>Notes: the USDA data for nutrient amounts in foods are not always very accurate. I believe the nutrient amounts linked by the parent represent an old Soylent recipe, since they have only 5g of fiber which is less than RDA of 25g (female) and 38g (male). &quot;-&quot; in the table indicates I don&#x27;t have data for this. (+ (* 4.1 400) (* 50 4.1) (* 65 9.3)) => 2449.5 calories for the Soylent data you linked [edit: I&#x27;m not sure if carbs included fiber so it&#x27;s possible that the Kale diet has 1% more calories than the Soylent diet]<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not recommending people eat 74.6 cups of Kale each day, but you can get all you need of these nutrients from a much more tasty diet of a variety of whole plant foods.<p><pre><code>  |                     | Soylent | Kale     |\n  |---------------------+---------+----------|\n  | Calories            | 2449.5  | 2449.1   |\n  | Carbohydrates       | 400 g   | 437 g    |\n  | Protein             | 50 g    | 213 g    |\n  | Fat                 | 65 g    | 46 g     |\n  | Sodium              | 2.4 g   | 1.9 g    |\n  | Potassium           | 3.5 g   | 24.5g    |\n  | Chloride            | 3.4 g   | -        |\n  | Fiber               | 5 g     | 179 g    |\n  | Calcium             | 1 g     | 7.4 g    |\n  | Iron                | 18 mg   | 73 mg    |\n  | Phosphorus          | 1 g     | 4.5 g    |\n  | Iodine              | 150 μg  | -        |\n  | Magnesium           | 400 mg  | 2349 mg  |\n  | Zinc                | 15 mg   | 28 mg    |\n  | Selenium            | 70 μg   | 45 μg    |\n  | Copper              | 2 mg    | 74 mg    |\n  | Manganese           | 2 mg    | 32 mg    |\n  | Chromium            | 120 μg  | -        |\n  | Molybdenum          | 75 μg   | -        |\n  | Vitamin A           | 5000 IU | 83220 IU |\n  | Vitamin B6          | 6 μg    | 13.5 mg  |\n  | Vitamin C           | 60 mg   | 5997 mg  |\n  | Vitamin D           | 400 IU  | 0        |\n  | Vitamin E           | 30 IU   | 77 mg    |\n  | Vitamin K           | 80 μg   | 35227 μg |\n  | Thiamin             | 1.5 mg  | 5.5 mg   |\n  | Riboflavin          | 1.7 mg  | 6.5 mg   |\n  | Niacin              | 20 mg   | 50 mg    |\n  | Folate              | 400 μg  | 7047 μg  |\n  | Biotin              | 300 μg  | -        |\n  | Pantothenic acid    | 10 mg   | 4.5 mg   |\n  | Lycopene            | 500 μg  | -        |\n  | Omega-3 fatty acids | 750 mg  | 9000 mg  |\n  | Ginseng             | 50 μg   | -        |\n  | Ginkgo biloba       | 100 μg  | -        |\n  | Lutein              | 500 μg  | -        |\n  | alpha-Carotene      | 140 μg  | -        |\n  | Vanadium            | 100 μg  |          |</code></pre>",1401332874

Extolling tech companies to hire more women without creating a larger pool of qualified female applicants is an exercise in futility. You can&#x27;t change the outputs without changing the inputs; one company hiring more women without changing the overall supply would only result in even worse ratios at other companies.<p>And the numbers are so terrible that if you had one company that managed to hire 50% women, that would mean you would have to have two other companies of equal size with only 2% women.

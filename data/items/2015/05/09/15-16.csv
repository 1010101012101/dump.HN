9516730,comment,9514404,9514688,0,0,mmcvicar,,,"Tuition for an engineering degree at the best universities in Chile is not 5k/year but closer to 7k/year. PUC is $9355, UChile is $7964, Santa Maria is $6456, USACH is $6388, U. Concepción is between $5200 and $7000 depending on the type of engineering.<p>It does not sound like a lot compared to the tuitions in Ivy League schools but is a lot considering average income. It is also important to remember that we are not talking about full cost of attendance but only tuition and fees. I took a look at the tuition and fees in undergraduate engineering programs in the US, Berkeley is $13,878, Caltech is $44,000 (however 91% get financial aid), Stanford $14,728, MIT is $23,200 (30% go tuition free, 56% get need-based scholarships), Carnegie Mellon is $49,610, Georgia Tech is $32,000.<p>Using the Household net adjusted disposable income reported by the OECD the average US household would be 2.8 times richer than a Chilean one. Given that it doesn&#x27;t look that it is more expensive than the US, I agree that Chile is not the most expensive but most likely among the most expensive. On another hand, given the particular income distribution in Chile using the average salary might give a wrong idea about how affordable is higher education.",1431187136

These days, I make software.<p>The maths background was helpful for developing logical reasoning, rigorous arguments, and working with abstractions.<p>Studying CS exposed me to a wider range of computing ideas than I’d encountered before, from formal models underlying relational databases to functional and logic programming. It also provided some basic but useful general knowledge about things like data structures, algorithms and complexity along the way.<p>I’m glad I studied both areas during my academic career, but for me neither is “better” than the other for someone starting out in the software industry. They just prioritise different skills and mindsets and provide different background knowledge, so each gives a different kind of head start.<p>I wouldn’t say either course taught me anything of great value about software engineering specifically, if we’re talking about the processes and tools used to actually design and build production software here. I think SE is more of a vocational/industrial field, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect a new grad in either math or CS to have much experience in, or even awareness of, the kinds of issues that come up in practice.<p>[1] Very roughly speaking, the diploma course was a one-year conversion course for people with a technical but not CS background, which included the same kinds of topics you’d study in the first couple of years of an undergraduate CS course.

It can be used to share secrets such as passwords or SSH Keys among participants. During the whole process, the API is never able to tell anything about the secret. Right now there is only a CLI written in ruby to use consume the API, more to come.<p>Essentially what it does is, it encrypts the secret with AES256 with a random key. Then the key is split into shares with Shamir&#x27;s Secret Sharing and each part is encrypted with the participating users public keys always containing a special server user. All of these cipher texts are then stored in the API. When a user wants to read a secret, the server&#x27;s share is decrypted and encrypted with the requesting users public key. Once the user receives the encrypted shares, she can simply decrypt the symmetric key with her private key and decrypt the secret.<p>I am excited to release the first preview of duse.

This year I came to live to Bay Area and now I work in a Startup.<p>There are several misconceptions and thoughts that I want to express.<p>1. Getting a &#x27;low tax student loan in Chile is easy&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s BS. If you&#x27;re in a good &#x27;public&#x27; University, it applies. You can get -more or less from the Government- (which behind the camera acts as an intermediare with a Bank) what we call &quot;Crédito Universitario&quot;. That is indeed low tax. However, most of Chileans don&#x27;t go to the top &#x27;Public Schools&#x27;, it&#x27;s hard to get in because you have to do well in what we have as a Standardized Test to apply for the University called PSU (University Selection Test). Most of the people in Chile end-up going to private Schools and to get a loan -as far as I know- you have to go directly to a Bank, and believe me, it&#x27;s not low tax. I&#x27;ve know people having to pay up to 50% more than what their studies costed.<p>2. There&#x27;s no class mobility in Chile.<p>This is true. It&#x27;s virtually non-existent. The reasons are quite complex, but let me elaborate on one of the factors.<p>The Universitary Selection Test is a test much like SAT. There&#x27;s Math, Language, Sciences (including social sciences), etc. When you apply to a university your presentation score is calculated from a ponderation between those tests and high school grades (9th-12th grade). In my case for example, for my Engineering School, it was something like 50% math test, 25% school, 25% Language test.<p>Since the School education in Chile is incredibly segregated, and there&#x27;s only some decent schools, guess who are the majority of people who are doing well at this test? Yep, you guessed right, people that come from wealthier families that could afford to put their children in, more expensive and better quality schools.<p>That people is who get the best scores at PSU, fill up most of the capacity of the top Universities high-paying degrees.<p>And this is why in Chile, the best careers in the best universities are full of people who are already in a very strong economic position (and from more or less higher class strata). Yes, you will see some very smart guys with a University Credit here and there studying Medicine/Engineering in the top Universities, but they are more in the exceptional spectrum.<p>3. It&#x27;s so bad that there&#x27;s a market for studying for the PSU.<p>To take on this opportunity, in Chile we have private &#x27;pre-universitarios&#x27; which are basically institutes that can charge even 4k a year, to better prepare you for PSU. People often go to them to improve their scores on their last year of School (after school)... again, guess who can pay them?<p>Personal Opinion:<p>We need a good educational reform in Chile. Sadly, the actual government is the worst we&#x27;ve had at executing on anything specific in a long time. They tried tackling a lot of very difficult challenges at the same time, and from what I&#x27;ve seen they have failed miserably.<p>The educational reform that will come out of this, will, most probably, be very watered down. People should pay, what they can pay for their education, that would fix part of the problems that the article correctly linked with the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. My father was born low-class and at his time, he could afford an education in a top university (costed him 0, then he had to work in the public sector to pay the state for his education). This is a reality, that simply doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, at least not like in pre dictatorship.<p>But remember that this is not only a money problem, even if it&#x27;s free... the PSU is still there acting as a filter, and without excellent and cheaper public schools things are not going to get incredibly better.<p>PS: For the ones suggesting that free internet and e-learning as a possible fix, I won&#x27;t enter that debate but no, I don&#x27;t think that can fix for any of this issues in Chile.",1431186167

In fact, in the case of String/Boolean/Number, calling them <i>with</i> new will often do something you don&#x27;t expect. (Calling them with new gives you a Number/String/Boolean <i>object</i>, not primitive, which can cause trouble when you try to compare them with ===, unless you remember to use their `valueOf` method)<p>Also, as noted below, it&#x27;s possible for objects to not have a `toString` method, so attempting to call it to get the object&#x27;s value as a string could blow up.

It leaves the opinions of a large proportion - often a <i>majority</i> - of society unrepresented or overruled.<p>As an example: The Tories now has a majority in parliament despite gaining only 36.9% of the vote. The majority of British voters does not want Tory policy. Yet it&#x27;s what Britain will get. Yes, the rest disagree on what the differences should be. But a proportional system forces the parties to negotiate and find solutions that actually has majority support - the least bad solutions.<p>I would take that over stability any day, if that was the choice.

Each transaction would include some coins and some output address. Then at specific intervals the script would dump all the received coins into the most popular of the received output address. It would effectively be sort of a rudimentary charity organization. The beauty of it is that enforcement is 100% guaranteed and automatic and there&#x27;s also 100% transparency and furthermore the script has no owners or masters.

I haven&#x27;t done Toastmasters myself, but the people that I know that like it feel that they have gotten a lot out of it. Despite the self-selection bias, I would recommend Toastmasters because communication skills are so important in the software field.<p>My company took a new approach and was making good progress with our product when the Open Software Foundation decided that industry standards in the area were needed.  This posed an existential threat to our existence since no one else was doing what we were doing in our unique way.  Instead of working as the software architect behind our design, I was thrust into role of software evangelist and had to speak persuasively in front of huge audiences (hundreds) and even participate in panel debates defending my designs against every imaginable critique from IBM, HP, Dec, Apollo, etc. They had deep talent, outside consultants (Carnegie Melon Univ professors, etc.), and they were all trying to take down my company.<p>Naturally, the most important way for a software person to be successful is to know your craft and be able to make software, but once you start to rise through the ranks you and your endeavors will greatly benefit from the ability to give a good technical presentation.<p>I had the good fortune of teaching a few courses in grad school and this led to an opportunity to do some internal training on new software methodologies in my first real job.  I worked on doing it well, and this eventually resulted in me being sent to Sweden, England, and Germany to speak about the company&#x27;s software to our own engineers and customers.  All of this prepared me for what I had to do for my own company&#x27;s success years later.<p>Suggestions for getting comfortable with public speaking:\nstart out easy (magic shows for your nieces and nephews), avoid Power Point (at first) and learn to think on your feet in front of an audience at a white board, work with material you know, and watch videos of excellent presentations in your field from conferences (there are so many on the internet now).",1431183763

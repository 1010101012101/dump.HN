But, believe it or not, it is also today's equivalent of what would have been an elaborate phone prank in the 80s.<p>The majority of these botnets are not run by organized criminals. They are run by adolescent nerds. I'd argue the same is true for the large majority of anyone involved with ""Anonymous"" in any shape and form. It's primarily a youth movement.<p>So, like with any other prank, I'm all for giving those kids a slap on the wrist (note how I didn't say ""prison sentence"").<p>However, to me the more interesting question in all this is a completely different one: Why do some of the largest organizations on the internet fail to protect themselves against a moderate attack like this?<p>It seems humiliating, to say the least, that a bunch of teenagers can take out Visa, Mastercard and Paypal at a whim. This could have been trivially prevented with technology and money. Thus, considering the impact it had, the first lawyer-word that crosses my mind is not ""sue the kids"". It's: Criminal neglience.",1291975166

Even better if it is open source - I get the strongest sense of ownership and control.<p>Using web apps takes away all my power in exchange for some convenience and (sometimes) the advantage of having access to large human networks.

One of it's goals as a musical current was for it to be understood by as many people as possible. It also has a simpler texture than baroque music. The musical forms are clearly defined and composers did a lot of derivative works, starting with theme and variations.<p>My guess is we see classical music as better because we only listen to the great composers, we don't get to hear that period's Biebers, Ke$has or Britneys.

Because we all basically know that the US state — like all states — is basically doing a lot of basically shady things basically all the time, simply revealing the specific ways they are doing these shady things will not be, in and of itself, a necessarily good thing. In some cases, it may be a bad thing, and in many cases, the provisional good it may do will be limited in scope. The question for an ethical human being — and Assange always emphasizes his ethics — has to be the question of what exposing secrets will actually accomplish, what good it will do, what better state of affairs it will bring about. And whether you buy his argument or not, Assange has a clearly articulated vision for how Wikileaks’ activities will “carry us through the mire of politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity,” a strategy for how exposing secrets will ultimately impede the production of future secrets. The point of Wikileaks — as Assange argues — is simply to make Wikileaks unnecessary.</i><p><a href=""http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-an...</a>",1291973077

1991125,comment,1990899,1990899,0,0,shin_lao,,,"For a more clever criticism of OOP:<p><i>I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work.</i><p>-Alexander Stepanov<p>edit : interview here <a href=""http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html</a>",1291972855

Nitpicking at Gruber specific points is one thing, but the fact is that paid apps on the Android store are getting nowhere. Arguing that ""this doesn't matter because free is the way to go"" is a reasonable opinion to hold, but misses the point. Android developers don't get to make a choice about that whatever their opinion, while iOS developers do. The counter argument is that as these platforms mature and become more capable the apps will become more functional and sophisticated, with attached services and customers will be more willing to pay for them. iOS developers have a shot at making that future happen, unless things change Android devs don't.",1291972684

One could equally well claim that a portion of non-users have an anti-drug bias for self-justification reasons. Where does one draw the line? The only solution is to not rely on 'opinions' and naked theory, but on data. Which is hard, but even when accounting for error margins, there is to the best of my knowledge no reason to accept that people who have at one point in their lives illegally used controlled substances have a statistically significant bias that distorts everything that comes from them.",1291972676

However, some people refer to visual art, such as painting, as ""fine art.""<p>IMOP ""better"" art is art that pushes the medium and makes people who consume it think or feel differently than they did before they consumed it. The more derivative the work, the less impact it makes on both pushing the medium and on the way we think.<p>In order to change the way people think and feel, it requires that the consumer of the art invest some effort in understanding it. The payoff to the consumer is they gain a new insight or feel the artist's conveyed emotion.<p>Pop music is not considered ""better"" art because it is often formulaic and designed to sell albums. Being derivative it often does not break new ground artistically. It's easy to consume (listen to) because we know what to expect musically. It's sorta' like comfort food. Listening to music that is ground breaking can often be difficult the first few listens, but then you get an ""ah ha! Yes!"" moment, and as your ears and brain realize what's going on, it becomes enjoyable. Then, other musicians copy it, make derivative versions that push the concept a little bit further, and you have a new genre.<p>There ya' go. My layman's answer. ;)",1291972005

4496045,story,,,2,1,jackfoxy,"Ask HN: What is the distribution of startup success?",,"In the Platonic world there is a distribution of the success of startups that achieve $500K (or more) of seed funding. For instance maybe 1 in a thousand achieve 100:1 returns on the seed investment in 5 - 7 years, 1 in ten goes completely to zero, and the whole range in between. It is pretty close to impossible to actually gather the information required to derive this distribution, but I think a survey of folks knowledgeable in the start-up funding area would be a decent proxy. If you think you can contribute to this survey, what is your estimate of the distribution? Let's establish the following ground rules:<p>1) By <i>startup</i> we mean largely software-driven company of interest to the HN community. It can either go on to VC financing, or not.<p>2) Startup achieved $500K+ seed capital on or after 1/1/2002 (we want to eliminate the dot-com bust as much as possible).<p>3) Within 7 years there is either an actual valuation event, or good subjective evidence to support a valuation. (This rule leaves many younger companies in a nebulous state. Use your judgement.)<p>4) <i>Return</i> is return on the seed investment.<p>5) Estimate for distribution points of 100:1, 50:1, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 0.5:1, 0.1:1, 0:1, summing to 1.<p>I realize this is not a substitute for due diligence, but simply a data point similar to total stock market return.",1347205796

They rob the rich (especially the rich who are sitting on assets but not working them), which makes it easier for the poor to build a bit of wealth.<p>Sorry but I find all ""rob the rich"" arguments down-right repugnant.  No government or individual should have the right to take what I have.  Period.  I am not rich, but, as a long time entrepreneur I have done well.  And I have also faltered, and I have also been down in the mud.  I have suffered, struggled and recovered only to come out of it better off in the end.  At no point have I ever thought about ""sticking it to the rich"".  Nah.  You own your own destiny.  If someone is a lazy fuck who wants others to provide for them, then, well, communism or socialism is the answer.  This concept of ""fair share"" is such bullshit.  Why does someone with more money have to pay more?  Because they have more money?  Circular argument, I guess.  If they want to be kind and contribute more money then that's their choice.  Otherwise, we all share alike.  If we have to build a new road that will benefit all, we split the costs evenly.  That's fair.  It isn't fair to point to the guy with more money (not rich, just more money) and make them pay more.<p>See, this argument gets lost very easily because people tend to talk about the rich.  Let's say that you make 50% more than your neighbor.  Nobody is rich.  He makes $100K per year and you make $150K per year.  Well, this liberal concept of ""fair share"" means that you should pay 50% more taxes at the gas station when you get gas.  That's your ""fair share"".  Because you make more money.  Not fair, you say?  Damn right.  Fair share, if you are going to be reasonable, means that you either split it equally or you base it upon consumption.  It does not mean that those with more money get clobbered over the head.  The formula has to be universally applicable.  You can't say that the alternate-reality fairness rule starts to kick-in after, say, $200K.  If the rule isn't fair at $100K it sure as heck ain't fair at $1 million.<p>Back to property taxes.  I recognize that governments need money to run.  I get it.  The issue here is that I ought to be able to own my home.  Free and clear.  Forever.  By taxing my home this is impossible.  The government, in effect, almost ""owns"" my home. If I stop paying property taxes I loose the house.  That should not be possible.  You work hard your entire life to buy a house.  Once it is paid for it should be yours forever.  It should be impossible for government to take it away from you.  That's my argument, plain and simple.  It isn't any more complicated than that.  I want to own my home free and clear.  Government can go get the funds they need through some other means.<p>Here's another example.  Let's say that I own a piece of land.  And, that, over a period of twenty years, I build my own home on this land.  Brick by brick.  Nail by nail.  Through my own efforts and that of my family, my kids, we physically build our own home.  Sure, it took twenty years but we built it and it is 100% paid for.<p>But, wait a minute, you can't do that.  Not without paying the government for a building permit before you even begin.<p>Why do I have to pay government for a permit to build a shelter for my family?<p>OK, let's say you play along.<p>What's the first thing that will happen in the US once you are done?<p>The property will get be appraised based on the value with the home you built and you will owe the government taxes for the rest of your life.<p>Then, when you die, your kids will have to pay a huge tax bill to the government based on the value of the property.<p>And, after that, your kids will have to continue to pay an annual property tax to the government based on the new value of the property.<p>Despite the twenty year effort and family sacrifice that went into building your home, the government has its hooks into your property for, well, eternity.  If you or any of your successors falters at all, the government gets to take it all.<p>That is wrong.  That should not be possible.",1347205456

4496017,comment,4495013,4495805,4,0,rayiner,,,"There is a difference between mortgage debt and credit card debt or student loans. You can't just ""cash out"" your student loan debt by selling the asset. You can usually do it with a house. Moreover, unlike a car, TV, etc, a house is typically an appreciating asset not a depreciating one.<p>In a way, mortgaging a house is like renting the home from the bank, but there is a key difference: you own any appreciation in the value of the home, not your landlord. Your mortgage payment is the same every year (and in real terms goes down over time because more of each payment becomes principal and because of inflation). Your apartment, meanwhile, gets more expensive every year. My rent in downtown Chicago has gone up 11% in three years.<p>Moreover, the mortgage interest and property tax deductions are among the only tax deductions available to higher-earning singles and couples. Your $2000 rent payment is not deductible, but $1500 of a new $2000 mortgage payment is deductible. Also, the portion of your rent payment that goes to paying property taxes is not deductible, but your property taxes are deductible. Depending on your tax bracket, this can be a lot of money.<p>Finally, buying a house is one of the only leveraged investments available to most people. Say you buy a $500k house with $100k down, at a low mortgage rate of 4.5% per year (mortgage rates are as low as 3.5% today). Say you're in a high tax bracket (= 33%). If your house appreciates 10% after two years, then after paying your interest your total return is 29% on your original $100k investment.<p>Now all of the math depends on the specifics of your situation. E.g. in Chicago property is pretty cheap relative to rent, so buying makes sense for more people than in places where rents are cheap relative to buying. The tax deductions are also much more valuable for people in higher tax brackets, particularly people who get hit with the AMT.<p>As an aside, it's inaccurate to say that all housing is characterized by a ""bubble cycle."" Housing prices in major metro areas increase in the long run because the amount of developable space in these areas remains fixed while population grows. This is unlike most commodities. The price or gold may fluctuate based on the discovery of deposits, but nobody is going to discover more land on Manhattan. This is not a rigid law of nature, of course... housing prices in Detroit collapsed when the city entered a death spiral of shrinkage, but something like that happens once a century. Even in this current housing bubble, most people in established metro areas are still up from where they were in 2000. The people who are underwater on their mortgages are mostly people who bought right before the bubble popped, people who refinanced, or people who bought in unestablished areas.",1347205059

The system provides encapsulation, and an embedded expression language for cases where mathematical notation is more concise.<p>The curious thing about the world's most talented Houdini programmers is that they don't consider themselves programmers at all; their job titles normally include the term 'artist'.

Probably not.  It was their stupid governments that triggered the entire thing and tens of millions died for it.<p>And that's my point.  Governments as we have known them for the last century or two need to mutate into something very different in order for us to evolve further as a society and culture.  We can't have the kinds of things you are seeing around the world happen to us.  Nobody ""owns"" me or you.  Therefore, the whole concept of governments telling and dictating what we can and cannot do is at odds with what I might call ""natural"" laws.<p>I, we, hire government workers to do things for us that have community scope.  Build roads.  Run the local school.  Upholds laws that we agree upon, etc.  Beyond that, things are completely upside-down.  No government should have the power to declare war.  Not any more.  If anything, the people should reserve that power and exercise it through voting.  The same is true of a myriad of other roles government plays today.<p>Take China as an example:  Over a billion people allowed a handful of people in Beijing to keep them from having more than one child.  Over a billion people.  Really?  What is it about the human condition that we allow such things to happen.  The point isn't to argue about the merit of the decision in the context of population explosion.  I believe that those things take care of themselves one way or the other.  The point here is that a society of over a billion people somehow allows a handful of communist leaders to control their reproductive rights.  That's just wrong.  If you allow that, of course they are going to come into your schools and indoctrinate the shit out of your children.<p>Here's another example.  Times are tough right.  Let's say you are unemployed and have to feed your family.  You happen to own a fishing pole and live near a lake or stream.  Here in California you can't go fishing and feed your family without a fishing license.  You have to buy a fishing license in order to engage in the most fundamental act a human being can engage:  hunt for food in order to survive.  Really?  Yes, really?  You are not allowed --by government-- to fish, no matter the circumstances.  If they catch you fishing without a license it can cost thousands of dollars and possibly end up doing time in jail.  In what alternate reality does this make any sense whatsoever.<p>OK, I understand about conservation, etc., etc.  Still, it is my right, as a human being on this planet, to hunt, fish and farm in order to feed myself and my family. No government should have the power to prevent me from doing so.<p>If John Lennon wrote that song thinking about communism then I have to find other words to describe some of my ideas, because communism is far, far from it.  When I read the words to the song I don't interpret communism in there but rather people living freely WITHOUT or with minimal government.<p>Now, before anyone goes off on me.  Admittedly the problem is very complex and, if it can even happen, it would take centuries of cultural evolution in order to reach even a portion of what I am talking about.  Take religion as an example.  It's got to go.  That will, I am sad to say, take a very long time.  The same is true of the attachment to the concept of countries.  That's got to go too.  Earth.

Were other people ever confused?<p>Vel Hogan: I wasn't confused but there was a, a few of the jurors that were confused so what we did in the jury room before we did anything after we did the election of who was going to lead the jury I told them let's just lay out on the table any concerns or open questions you may have that's left over and let's just get that out of the way first.<p>Emily Chang: Now when you first got into the jury room initially, this was Wednesday right?<p>Vel Hogan: Yes.<p>Emily Chang: Was? There are reports that you were initially divided but did you, did you have a feeling this was going to sway overwhelmingly in Apples favour?<p>Vel Hogan: No. No. In fact if you'd have asked me at that moment in time, I thought it was gonna ultimately maybe lean the other way.<p>Emily Chang: Why?<p>Vel Hogan: Why? We were at a stalemate but some of the jurors weren't sure of the patent prosecution process. Some weren't sure of how, ah, prior art could either render a patent accept... ah, acceptable or whether it could invalidate it and so what we did is we started talking about one and the day was over. When I was at home thinking about that patent, ah, claim by claim, limit by limit I had what we would call an aha moment.<p>Emily Chang: Um hmmm.<p>Vel Hogan: And I suddenly decided that I could defend this if it was my patent.<p>Emily Chang: Really?<p>Vel Hogan: Really. And with that, I took that story back to the jury, laid it out for 'em, they understood the points that I was talking about and then we meticulous, meticulously went patent by patent claim by claim against the test that the judge had given us because each area, each patent had a different ah legal premise to judge on. We got that all sorted out and decided which ones were valid, which ones weren't valid.<p>Emily Chang: So the initial stalemate that you found yourself in, what was that about?<p>Vel Hogan: It was about a particular, ah, patent, ah, the '460 patent, and whether or not the prior art really did invalidate that pattern, that patent and so with that moment I had, I realized that the software on the Apple side could not be placed into the processor on the prior art and vice versa.<p>Emily Chang: Um hmm.<p>Vel Hogan: And that means that they're not interchangeable and that just cha..., that changed everything right there<p>Indeed it did.",1347203802

For example, in some languages (like JavaScript) you can add strings to numbers 'x' + 3 becomes 'x3'. This can be a problem because if you have made a mistake in your program, instead of raising an exception execution will continue but your variables now have wrong and unexpected values. In a strongly typed language (like Python) you can't perform operations inappropriate to the type of the object - attempting to add numbers to strings will fail. Problems like these are easier to diagnose because the exception is raised at the point where the error occurs rather than at some other, potentially far removed, place.\nIn a statically typed language, the type of variables must be known (and usually declared) at the point at which it is used. Attempting to use it will be an error. In a dynamically typed language, objects still have a type, but it is determined at runtime. You are free to bind names (variables) to different objects with a different type.

A trivial piece of software will end up costing multiple millions of dollars over the life of the product if you factor in support and maintenance and new versions.<p>According to Gruber, who points it out snarkily, Amazon made only $7 million last quarter. <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/27/amzn-profit-correction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/27/amzn-profit-corr...</a><p>So, it's a question of Linux server vs. desktop Linux, the latter of which has very less marketshare as to be a drop in the ocean of Amazon's revenues. They figure that the goodwill loss among desktop Linux users is not worth the effort to get their services working on Linux, since things like DRM for the movie streaming service is usually more tricky on Linux.<p>They do support Android though, so it shows that it's not about Open Source but about profitability. Many companies leveraging Open Source do not feel the need to give back more than for just that software in question, see Apple with no support for Open Source desktop at all, and wrapping the BSD stuff in heavy DRM on iOS.

Sure that's a lot more than an RDBMS engine.

Stonebraker isn't entirely impartial here as he's trying to sell his own product in this area (VoltDB) which is highly dependent on the ""database-side logic"" approach.<p>There's an important tradeoff being discussed here, which is, ""can we get directly the data we want from the query"", versus, ""do we need to load all the data into our app first and filter it there"".   This is of course the critical thing that a lot more people need to learn, and the work I do with SQLAlchemy is all about this.   But in the SQLA approach, we use Python constructs on the app side which expand into SQL functions when rendered in a query.   The effect is very similar to that which I see in most of the examples in your posts.<p>While I think advanced data models and rich SQL-side functionality are essential, the usage of stored procedures is IMHO not the only way to get there.   In practice I often use a mix of both, depending on how verbose the function needs to be.<p>Keeping SQL functions as app-side constructs has the advantage of source code management.   It's easier to support multiple kinds of backends (I run against PG and SQL Server a lot) since you aren't tied to a stored procedure language.  There's no need to emit new stored procedure definitions to the database in order to support new features of the application.  You don't have the issue of updating a stored procedure on the database side such that multiple application versions, targeted to different versions of the database function, still continue to function.    I think there are ways to approach these problems in favor of SPs, but they require some thought on how the source code is maintained, managed, and deployed.  For now I've just stuck with keeping most SQL functions on the app side.<p>The big namespacing problems I see are, what if two different kinds of ""classes"" want to have the same method name ?   The definition of a PG function here creates a name that's global to the whole schema - this suggests we may want names that are qualified with a ""class name"".   And what if you do in fact need two versions of the same function present to support different application versions ?   In that case maybe we want to qualify the names of the functions with version ids as well.    This actually sets up a great opportunity to use an application side system of rendering class/version qualified SQL names in response to plain names on the app side.<p>I guess my point is that the ""app logic in stored procedures"" approach is interesting, it has some management/deployment issues that also might be interesting to solve, but app-rendered SQL when using an effective enough app-side toolkit can solve the problem just as well in most cases.",1347202831

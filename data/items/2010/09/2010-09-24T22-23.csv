1725719,comment,1725395,1725629,0,0,tomkarlo,,,"As someone who hires in LA, and moved to LA to take a job here, your perception is either outdated or simply incorrect. There are a good number of shops here in LA, including Google, Amazon, Hulu, Sony and Yahoo that pay well above the median for good talent. A good dev or PM is going to make as much here as in New York, Seattle or San Francisco, although admittedly there are fewer positions overall than those cities. Additionally, most if not all of those major tech employers regularly pay relocation costs to move people here from other tech centers - it's just not practical to run a dev team here and not do it, given the smaller number of engineering grads.<p>Additionally, while having a car is a requirement (as it is in all but a handful of US cities), cost of living is lower than in New York or SF, which are the two most likely alternatives. Rent is lower (my rent here is half of what it would be in those cities) and most of your weekend activities are either free (beach, mountains, etc) or cheaper than SF or NY. And there's more of them too: there aren't many places in the US where you can ski on Saturday and go play volleyball on the beach on Sunday, which is why much of our team are Seattle or San Fran weather refugees.<p>As for Perl, I'd argue that because the tech / web media industry here in LA is newer, there aren't as many folks around who date back to the years when Perl was the dominant platform. When I started developing for the web, it was one of the few practical options; now I'm sure I'd be starting with Ruby or Python. What we do is hire engineers who are smart enough to work in any language, and then let them pick up a book and learn Perl, rather than filter first for that specific language.",1285369128

1725709,comment,1725395,1725685,0,0,jrockway,,,"Same.  I took my current job and the Perl code did not look too different from mine.  If anything, they tried a lot harder to make it look nice than I do.<p>I work on a lot of open source Perl, and it all looks the same.  Sure, I can tell mst's code apart from nothingmuch's, but I never have any trouble understanding what it's doing.  The community has decided on a style, and everyone gets on just fine.  It's so pervasive that even people that don't hack on the code every day pick up the style; like I said before, code written by never-contributed-to-open-source don't-even-know-what-github-is coworkers does not look too different from what I'd expect.  People wrote bad Perl in 1995, and I've seen it, but this problem is largely solved.  (The same cannot be said about Python.  I wasted two days last week debugging the XML parser included in the core!  That is some <i>legacy</i> code...)<p>The reason we can't find Perl programmers is because everyone likes their job.  When you jump ship as a Perl programmer, it's from one bank to another, or one small web shop to another.  If you're a Python programmer, on the other hand, you get to do something exciting like go from no-name-consulting-company to Google.  Google, that site you visit every day and that has a ball pit and pool in their offices!!  Google!!<p>The kinds of places that do Perl tend to be boring.  I may work for a bigger company than Google and affect more people, but I don't get a ball pit, I don't get free food, and I don't get to say, ""oh, you know Google Reader?  I added a new feature on that today.""  When talking to non-programmers, I try not to even mention my work, because it sounds that boring.  When you work for Google, everyone thinks it's exciting.  This makes it easy to find people that want to work on your language, just because there is a general feeling of coolness about it.  If you're not working for Google <i>today</i>, then you're working to attract their attention or something.<p>Extrapolate this anecdote to the rest of the community... and you have a hard time finding people to hire.  (My employer has trouble hiring people because they try to be cheap.  ""Oh, well we can only guarantee you a 6 month contract, no insurance, and you have to pay to move across the country"".

If you mean design in the broader sense then comparing ""Professional"" design with ""Non-Professional"" is like asking if you can test the difference between a product made by someone who knows how to build a product versus someone who doesn't. Anyone building a product is, in fact, designing. Whether they are good at it is another thing entirely. Design is combination of ""how things work"" and ""how things look"" (and I'd even argue the latter is still a child of the former).<p>Visual design as decoration is probably less effective, and I think you'll get a lot of that with ""Unprofessional"" designers. Visual design as a way to amplify/enhance existing well-designed interactions is definitely effective (i.e. strong button affordance, good use of color to convey meaning, etc). This is the type of output you'll get with a ""Professional"" designer.<p>Philosophy aside, I think you'd probably do better with qualitative testing. Do people tend to complete tasks easier if the action being tested ""looks"" easier? Does the brand identity match the audience you're targeting? Are your design patterns consistent across the site?

1725629,comment,1725395,1725395,0,0,bugsy,,,"There are two questions here: What's the situation with LA and What's the situation with Perl.<p>It's challenging to get people to move to LA. People who like LA are in LA. People outside of LA have a hard time seeing its charms given the lack of transportation structure other than giant freeway traffic jams and busses that come a few times a day and can take a half day to travel a few miles. The cost of living in a decent neighborhood is very high, yet most positions offer mid west style salary. Most developers will take a huge hit to their standard of living by accepting an LA job, so LA employers mostly try to recruit locally and even when they do recruit from out of town, few are willing to attend to basic hygiene issues such as paying for relocation costs.<p>On the Perl issue, I use Perl for a lot of things because it is very fast to code in and to execute. I find both C and assembler easier to understand than trying to read a complex regular expression in perl or decipher data structures in perl that use pointers due to a syntax that is still unintuitive after a decade of use. Regular expressions probably can't be simplified since they are their own very dense language, but the pointer syntax could be improved a lot. Perl code that creates classes and objects is quite hard.<p>Coding in Perl can be a challenge and Perl is so large that all of us are expert at different things which means that almost every single piece of new perl code I see is like having to learn a new language.<p>I have just ""dealt with it"" all this time, but it's possible, given this post about LA, that fewer developers are willing to deal with the overhead of learning Perl given that for simple sites PHP can be more efficient for them, and for system scripts things like python have gotten more traction.",1285366449

It seems too complicated guessing calories etc. BUT maybe you can have two ""modes"". Turn on ""Food Porn"" and that is what you get, switch to ""Health Porn"" and that's what you get. I probably would peek at both.<p>- This is probably not doable, but if you could integrate menus (like menupages) and calorie counts from restaurants, people could take the picture, pick the food (like on foursquare you pick the venue) and post. Food numbers would come along.<p>- Single player mode would work better in health mode than food porn mode. You could have numbers to strive for, but then why would you post pictures really? You could just post food.<p>- Multi player mode could work for sexiest looking food, or for ""I'd Eat That!"" points. Maybe unlock a badge swarm style.<p>- Not to mix day job with side project, but it could be pretty sweet to integrate the Eat.ly app (if there will be one) with a ""post to foursquare"" option so that if you check in your foursquare status can have an eat.ly link to a picture.",1285366382

He's not claiming to have a counterexample to the famous theorem, he's claiming to have a way of making almost any quicksort implementation (randomized or not) misbehave if you're allowed a comparison function that makes decisions on the fly. Which, in fact, he does.<p>The reason I posted the code was simply to demonstrate that when McIlroy says ""an adversary can do X"", he's telling the truth (with the notion of ""adversary"" he's using) and has in fact provided an adversary that <i>does</i> do X.",1285365779

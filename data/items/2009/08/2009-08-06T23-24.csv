In fact, I've never received an email from a customer or potential customer about the negative aspects of the icon, while we've gotten a bunch from people who really like the approach to design and copywriting on both the site, the description page, and the app itself.<p>So, two things:<p>a) Business side. We certainly lose out on some customers who are turned off by the icon- that's probably the case with yourself. You posted in another thread saying you'd be interested in our upcoming Free Audiobooks app, so maybe we'll lose that sale based on the icon.<p>Based on past performance I'm confident that the upside of extra sales gained balances the downside of sales lost- that's what makes the icon effective. It stands out because most folks wouldn't be comfortable offering it, which is why there aren't a million icons that look just like it. It's a risk, and it's paying off.<p>b) Romanticization of a brutal dictatorship. I feel it mocks the Soviets more than anything- it's over the top and campy.  Like on freebooksapp.com - ""Free Books. Better than vodka. Great success!"". Cheap laugh? For sure. But it converts phenomenally, with 2.5 minutes average time on site and 15% bounce rate in primary markets, and positive customer feedback in email.<p>If you look at the browse page (freebooksapp.com/browse) it's clearly done campy/mocking, not romanticizing- ""selection like glorious grocery store!"".<p>Taking the application flow as a whole, I just don't think there's any way that anyone can take this as a vote for communism.

746653,comment,746621,746621,0,0,keefe,,,"This article describes model driven application development, the focus of my current company, where an application is considered to have a model that describes the application state and a domain specific model and the model that describes application state may be varied dynamically. This is completely distinct from programming. Programming is about manipulating data and how a computer actually operates on data (threads & ram etc). Somebody will always have to do programming in some language in order to enable ""interesting"" business users with such point of views to do things easily. The other side of the model-driven coin (distinct from UI code) is using rules to describe data transformations. This is not exactly a shameless plug because I am leaving this company but you can see model driven development in action by downloading TopBraid Composer Maestro Edition <a href=""http://www.topquadrant.com/products/TB_Composer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topquadrant.com/products/TB_Composer.html</a> and navigating to <a href=""http://localhost:8083/tbl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8083/tbl</a> You will see several applications which you can select and then select a data model to work with.... at that point your application is in a particular state (such and such widget configuration) that application state may then be saved off as another application and so forth. Going back to TBC you can see that actual data models that represent this application state and you can look into SparqlMotion and SPIN for how inferencing can be used to add support for rules in a model driven manner. The advantage of TQ's approach is that it is based on open standards most notably RDF, which is a sufficiently generic data model that it may be considered universal. I still believe that actually implementing components and complex algorithms should still be done in code. To me the memory state of an operating system represents a very particular closed world that can then be mapped to the general, open world expressed in RDF (or however you like to express the universe of data, I believe RDF is best atm)",1249600555

Startup founders are a very small percentage of the population, and while it is growing it is likely to remain very small (and successful startup founders are a relatively small percentage of startup founders at that....)<p>Even for those that do, few of them do or should have started work on the startup during high school.<p>As to academia, there is certainly a correlation with people in those programs and people that go into academia, but I think the causal connection is relatively weak.

127865,comment,127711,127848,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"Agreed, spanking is viable as long as the child is still young. Also, it should only be done on the flat of the palm or on the buttocks, and not too hard. The goal isn't to inflict pain, but to send the child a message that what he did was wrong.<p>The kid will most likely cry even though your hitting his/her hand will not really hurt. Its the fact that you're hitting them that they don't like, cause its a negative connotation.<p>Aside from it, lots of love and affection! Kids need attention while they're young or they'll claim you're a bad parent. They need affirmation.",1204523263

127859,comment,127711,127817,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Most of the ""evidence"" for autism caused by vaccines is statistical manipulation, anecdotes, and scare-mongering. There is perhaps a very remote chance of a correlation but its almost certainly a case of ""When I changed the windshield wipers on my car the AC quit. You wiper-villains owe me a new AC!"" When bad stuff happens, people desperately grasp for a simple cause they can understand.<p>Get vaccines.

127848,comment,127711,127804,0,0,noonespecial,,,"2 year olds have not reached the age of reason. Reasoning with them only gets you a restatement of their desires without any logical context whatsoever:<p>Daddy, I want to play over there! Son, there's a constant stream of cars going by at 40mph, you will die instantly or be hurt worse than you can possibly imagine. But I WAAANNNT TOOOO...<p>Spanking (when administered carefully and without angry reaction) seems to be a valid form of behavior modification for a creature that does not have any reasoning ability because it allows aversion to be stored directly in the same part of the brain that is motivating desire. Its probably better to reason with a 9 year old than spank but as the parent states, anyone who thinks that a 2 year old can reason, doesn't have one.",1204521993

This slide set is pretty accurate in terms of what to expect but I'd weight the API's/language/philosophy sections down a bit. I only got a few language questions and absolutely none about development philosophies (except for maybe ""emacs or vim?""). Algorithms & data structures are what you should be studying. Puzzles too but that's more about doing a lot -- you can't really study per se.",1204521979
127846,comment,127841,127841,0,0,yters,,,"Why do I think this belongs on Hacker News?  Because 1) this poem itself is one crazy hack of densely packed meaning within meaning and 2) the site is the best of all lit resources I've seen online, period.  If you want to be a great hacker, you've got to know how people think around you, and to do that you've got to understand our culture.<p>Why this poem matters: If you've read a significant number of classics, you'll notice we've recently undergone an extraordinary change in the way we view reality.  This poem is about the fall out of this shift and where we are going next.  However, the cultural currents are not something you can just say explicitly.  They have to be experienced to be understood, and that is what this poem is for.<p>Website background: If you've read the Wasteland before, you probably know the poem is basically a collage of reference upon obscure reference to classical and contemporary poetry.  Very confusing, yet mysteriously intriguing, for the literary novice like myself.<p>This kind soul has done a very good job hyperlinking all these references to their sources.",1204521888

127835,comment,127322,127652,0,0,vsingh,,,"Notwithstanding your objection to my use of poetic license, let me refocus: I argue your revulsion of TED's smugness is similar to other people's revulsion of our culture here. I once said:<p>""It surprises me that people can indict others with the adjective 'holier-than-thou' and not feel ashamed of themselves. The word screams, 'I'm going to bring you down to my level!'""<p>Smug, holier-than-thou, arrogant, self-righteous: one can easily inflict these words on pg for unashamedly littering his essays with references to Leonardo da Vinci and Jane Austen and Copernicus and Kelly Johnson. At times I've felt put off by the way he does this, but I'm rational enough to know this emotion - the emotion that coerces us to prevent our fellow apes from rising above their proper place - is wrong, at least in this case.<p>So what if TED is smug? They deserve to be - many of their videos are really, truly interesting. As an example, I recently enjoyed the one on African Aid: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/159"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/159</a>.

(But of course that's why you use a correctly-implemented MAC, right?)<p>I concur with you that new cryptographic protocols are likely to be flawed, and your recent blog post on that subject was excellent reading.",1245909374

There are databases that can store trees of objects just fine as is, not all databases force you to store everything in tables.<p>To me, the conversation is about trade-offs, and if the alternative database (for example) forces you to get rid of ACID transactions, then it's not as cut-and-dry as you purport.",1245909312

If you want performance, use a database that will store your data structure as is and avoid the disassemble/reassemble step as well as avoiding writing the extra code to do it.<p>Relational databases didn't win because they're fast, they won because they're flexible for querying and language neutral, both features which necessarily slow the database down.<p>> It's trivial to scale out stateless code; databases are the hard part.<p>Not really relevant to the conversation.

673202,comment,672829,672829,0,0,andres,,,"I've had problems with MemcacheDB and I'm curious to hear about other people's experiences.<p>Basically, I've found that under high read/write loads I get occasional socket timeouts (tested on linux/osx). I think the underlying reason for the timeouts are Berkeley DB locks when data gets flushed to disk. Beyond the hassle of getting intermittent socket timeouts the real problem is that the memcache client API fails gracefully because it was specifically designed to be fault tolerant. You can check for socket errors and retry queries but you'll still get unpredictable query times.<p>I'm coming to the conclusion that it's an architecture issue - MemcacheDB is a persistent database abstracted behind an interface specifically designed for non-persistence. The abstraction leaks when the database locks.",1245907107

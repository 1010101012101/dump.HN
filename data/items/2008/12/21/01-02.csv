I think the NAND to Tetris approach is really great in this regard.  It's designed to be the place where it all comes together for a Comp Sci person.<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7654043762021156507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7654043762021156507</a>",1229824407

I've read, and believe through my own intuition/experience, that being a ""true expert"" in most things is often such an intuitive place to be that it cannot be translated mechanically in that person's mind into steps for teaching it.<p>It's arrived at after years and years of ""doing"" and growing past internal boundaries and goals.<p>One thing you can be a ""true expert"" at is teaching itself.",1229824154

In addition to the larger display, the picwing frame runs on a faster hardware platform, supports Actionscript 3 for application development and doesn't require the user to go to a different computer to customize and install widgets. Eventually we would like to release an application store (running on the frame itself) for people to install new apps for their frame.\nWe are ourselves big fans of the chumby and we have tried to learn from its advantages and shortcomings.",1229823544

He is still sharp, but he was never good with computers and lately he's pretty much lost whatever ability he had. The key thing I need is the ability to send him podcasts and videos of booktalks that queue up sequentially as if they were blog posts in an RSS feed. What I also need is the ability to check online to see if he's already viewed something, and if so the ability to get rid of it and add more stuff to his queue.",1229823147

405038,comment,404233,404292,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The Rijksmuseum has a couple of pieces of such excellent craftsmanship in it, that if you like design, just seeing those can make it worth the visit.<p>The ivory-hilted matchlock pistols are some of the most beautiful weaponry I've ever seen. There's some excellent fencing swords in the museum as well. If you like arms, it's worth it just to see them - but I've fenced and like marksmanship, so I've got a bit of a bias. Night Watch is in there too, and it's gigantic and a fun painting. You can cruise the whole museum in a couple hours even while dedicating some time to a few really interesting pieces, and I enjoyed it much.<p>So I'll put in a vote for the Rijksmuseum, I do like it. If you like electronic music, lots of good DJs spin in Amsterdam but you'll have to look up where the party is. The Westerhousefabric district outside of the city has more of a local nightlife scene, as opposed to the hardcore tourism you see in central AMS.<p>If you're by chance going to England after Holland, taking the ferry from Hoek van Holland to Harwich is an incredible experience. Hoek van Holland is a really, really wonderful little town, with some great cafes, restaurants, and friendly people. The train ride there from AMS is beautiful. Then the ferry is lots of fun if you like boats.",1229821755

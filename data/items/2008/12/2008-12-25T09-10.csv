His thesis is that bureaucracy tends to build on itself, becoming less rational and more wasteful as a society ages. Occasionally, there is a catastrophic event that overturns the established order, wiping out the cruft and allowing society to start fresh. However, over time the waste grows again.<p>He uses this theory to explain why the American South did so well after reconstruction and after the Civil Rights movement. He would likely also argue that this explains why Japan and China have done so well, since both underwent massive disruptions in the last century. Our own society, however, has been very stable for many centuries and has had plenty of time to accumulate bureaucratic lard.",1230199159

I think it is time that Open Source learned about culture - because the Wild West version does not really work for something that has cooperation at it's core.",1230198888

Hong Kong is <i>not</i> the only example of a hyper-advanced Asian city. Shanghai, Taipei, Tokyo, Beijing... you name it, and we're not even approaching India and further west.<p>The success of China, Japan, South Korea, and the myriad of other east Asian powers is not an isolated case of blind luck. Incredible dedication has been shown here to grow a nation's infrastructure, and the US would be wise to take heed and follow suit if they want to maintain their lead.<p>Take a look at the bureaucracy needed to manage a country of 1.3 billion people, including a wealth gap far wider than that of the US, and yet continually building out massive infrastructure projects both urban and rural. This is something America is not doing, and I'd hate to see a repressive dictatorship out-do the West in anything.",1230198442

I don't like the folksey tone either, but it sells papers and gets attention.<p>Believe it or not, there are many Americans who still believe that they are the top of the world, that in Asia people are still wallowing in shantytowns and mud-brick houses. When my mother first came to Canada, someone actually asked her if we had running water and electricity.<p>The ""USA No. 1"" mentality that many people still seem to have is the main reason why the US cannot proceed to fixing itself - most people have never traveled outside of the USA, least of all to Asia, and the media doesn't cover this nearly enough - Asia is advancing rapidly, its wealth and quality of life is rapidly approaching that of the US, and unless you <i>act now</i> your supremacy in the world will be lost forever.<p>Until more people realize how advanced Asia has become, I think Thomas Friedman's message is entirely appropriate and welcome.",1230198144

As it is, your attempt at language play is one that brings to mind a concentrated effort to put round pegs into square holes.",1230198121
409523,comment,408786,408996,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Don't buy gold and silver. I don't know where this ""buy gold"" superstitious BS came from. I think it's out of some mistaken idea that gold has intrinsic value where paper money does not. This is false.<p>The value of gold is not intrinsic - it is assigned by people, just like fiat currency (which is also why gold-backed currency, or the lack thereof, is not our problem). In fact, gold's value also fluctuates with the economy, <i>just like everything else</i> - when the economy tanks, gold prices rise, etc etc. It's almost expected for people to run screaming back to gold every time the economy hiccups, and this has made it an unsafe commodity to hold.<p>Not to mention when you buy gold - you are <i>not buying any actual, physical gold</i>, you are buying gold production, which will <i>never ever reach your hands</i>. If you <i>really</i> want to hoard precious metals, at least go out and physically have it. Your gold is just as imaginary as fiat money until you have it in your hands.",1230197855

I am convinced I worked for Korean gangsters now; However back then I thought it was a kick ass job (Since nobody I knew was working.) I still own one fried 8088 mobo (black to black wha?) and the three surfboards I managed to buy whilst working. In reality it was one of the worst jobs I have ever had, as I had to work in an attic sorting PC parts and fetching orders in 100+ attic heat with a 4ft ceiling (I kid not) and had to get to work Sundays @ 5am to unload ""orders"" from Mexico from the meanest people I have ever met. I learned more about life in that year then I have in the last 20.",1230197682

There are an insane number of features that Word has, that even a high school student would need, that are entirely absent from Pages (a robust referencing system, for example).<p>What I would pay big money for is something that has the functionality of MS Word Mac, without the bloat, and as speedy as Pages.",1230197265

In a sense, 'true democracy' is a lot like 'true communism' - both sound good on the outside but have issues when implemented. Like the Digg article, it seems that 'equality of vote' is one of the ideals that isn't enforced in real life (due to social engineering, money, politics, etc)",1230197107

If you want to post paragraphs with links in them, use Wordpress or Tumblr or Blogger or whatever, and submit a link to it.</i><p>Ah -- no.  I've submitted several posts without writing a blog post about them.  It feels natural to do so, like I'm conversing with you rather than sending you a letter.  It sucks that self posts are automatically weighted ""heavier"" than normal submissions, so it's harder for them to gain traction and they fall off the page sooner.  It feels rather unfair.  I'd hate for the feature to go away completely.",1230195822

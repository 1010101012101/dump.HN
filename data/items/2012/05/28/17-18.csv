4034323,comment,4033866,4034153,4,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Teach it like music.</i><p>Any competent music teacher (I write as the husband of a piano teacher) can perform music with musical expression, and thus show students examples of the beauty of music. But the very best music teachers are also intimately familiar with all the isolated subskills that build into understanding a piece of music, and controlling the performer's muscle movements, and responding to the audience in a live setting to build a coherent, musically expressive performance. My wife teaches skills such as ""music mapping,""<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Music-Learning-Teachers-Students/dp/0895793970/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Music-Learning-Teachers-Studen...</a><p>proper hand position,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Playing-Less-Hurt-Prevention-Musicians/dp/1423488466/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Playing-Less-Hurt-Prevention-Musicians...</a><p>and how to tie those and many other skills together<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Art-Piano-Playing-Heinrich-Neuhaus/dp/1871082455/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Art-Piano-Playing-Heinrich-Neuhaus/dp/...</a><p>as part of a comprehensive process of teaching making music.<p>The basic problem with mathematics education at the elementary school level in the United States (see my previous reply to this thread<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4034248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4034248</a><p>generally commenting on the submitted article) is that elementary school mathematics teachers can do NONE of the comparable things with mathematics that a good music teacher can do with music. They cannot isolate and focus on useful techniques, they cannot put on an example performance of solving an interesting, challenging problem, and they cannot make connections between their (poor) understanding of the problems found in elementary mathematics and their students' (often better, but different) understanding of the same problems. In the United States, people mostly seek music instruction for young learners from the private enterprise system. My wife gains most of her new clients, who are crammed into her busy teaching schedule as previous clients graduate from secondary school and go off to university, from friends of current clients who are happy with her work. By contrast, an elementary school teacher in a typical government-run school in the United States teaches on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with attendance being compulsory in default of a government-approved alternative, and funding guaranteed to the school, and thus employment guaranteed to the teacher, whether the learners learn mathematics or not. Systemic change is necessary to get mathematics taught as music is taught to elementary-age pupils in the United States.<p>For an eye-opening look at how elementary mathematics teachers could be prepared, and how that would help learners, see Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics in China and the United States by Liping Ma.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p>That book is a very enjoyable--but rather shocking--read, full of information about how to teach mathematics for ""Profound Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics.""",1338227596

In case it's helpful, your 20 seconds of attention on a first look over a CV would go something like this if I were the reviewer:<p>1. Made an effort to produce a distinctive on-line CV. Good.<p>2. Layout at top of page is broken and chose an unusual and poorly rendered web font. Bad.<p>3. What does he actually do? Generic terms like ""building web systems"" and ""creating beautiful code"" don't tell me very much. Neutral (but wasting time).<p>4. Ah, OK, he's a full stack guy, with a variety of modern tools listed. Better.<p>5. But despite talking about HTML5, CSS3, and other modern front-end technologies, the layout is completely broken again around that diagram, and neither the typography nor graphics are well done generally. Bad.<p>6. Despite claiming many years of experience, the practical skills and attention to detail aren't up to professional standards.<p>7. No hire.<p>I am left with the impression of a Jack of all trades but master of none. I did read on to the end of your CV after I recorded the above, and to be brutally honest, it reinforces that impression.<p>You're a contractor and keen to learn new technologies, which suggests that while buzzword-compliant you don't necessarily have much depth behind any of the technologies you mention throughout the CV, and nothing you say anywhere really counters that impression with hard data about years of experience with each tool, how many projects you've done with each tool and what kind of scale they were on, etc.<p>You're a UX designer, but your CV isn't optimised for scannability at all.<p>You adapt to change, yet the reason your layout is broken right at the top of the CV is that you're using a static background image to create a bubble that doesn't quite fit the text you wanted to show in it, instead of gracefully degrading CSS3 that would have expanded automatically to fit that text.<p>You believe in lots of testing and continuous integration, yet you've failed basic cross-browser compatibility on several counts, all of which would be common knowledge to a good web designer/developer.<p>OK, enough with the negativity. I figure that usually being brutally honest on these occasions is more helpful in the long run than sugar-coating stuff that is bad, but please don't take any of this personally or think I'm just having a dig.<p>If I were you, I would either spend a bit of time polishing up my front-end skills to get the design into shape or acknowledge the limitation (both personally and by toning down the related content in the CV) and get help from someone who is an expert in that particular area. I would also get help from a professional careers advisor or other CV-writing expert on how to organise your content for the way real people are going to read that CV.

Perhaps most of you HN participants can read the study publication directly online.)<p>The study found and the book reports that ""Putting more resources into U.S. middle school mathematics teachers' education could significantly raise future teachers' mathematics skills but may not be sufficient to equal those in countries where mathematics skills are substantially higher or produce sufficient numbers of more highly skilled middle school mathematics teachers, for two reasons. Average mathematics knowledge among U.S. college students is much lower than in Taiwan, South Korea, or Germany, and because of the relatively low salaries and prestige of teaching in the United States, the college students enrolled in teacher education are likely to average much lower mathematics skills than the large number of students in science, engineering, and economics/business."" (Pages 278-279) The book also reports, especially relevant as a commment on the submitted article here, ""South Korean and Taiwanese future teachers included both simple and complex examples in their lessons, usually including these in the beginning and middle of the lesson. By contrast, sampled U.S. future teachers tended mostly to use simple examples and to include them at the very end of the lesson."" (Page 289)<p>Teachers in the early grades having adequate mathematics preparation to help young learners advance in their understanding is a very severe problem in the United States, where it has been reported that most elementary school teachers in a sample of teachers in New Jersey did not know a general rule for finding the area of a rectangle if the side lengths of the rectangle are known.<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>The dramatic differences in teacher preparation result in dramatic differences in mathematics achivement between countries.<p><a href=""http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>(See Exhibit 1.1 on pages 34 and 35 of the .PDF document for an example of an excellent use of parallel boxplots to compare the centers of various groups.)

Are you involved in a local Bay Area government? Are you working to change the things you don't like?<p>The article, and this response is very frustrating to me. The notion that the government is broken and that our policies are insane and that politicians don't care just does not match my personal experience. Yes, there are many, many problems -- from the garden variety to the wickedly complex. I can however comfortably say that Palo Alto is generally run by decent, intelligent people responsible to an engaged, accessible city council.<p>Available and affordable housing for example, is and has been part of the city plan, done in coordination with the Association of Bay Area Governments[1], who develop regional growth projections and plans[2] that cities are required to incorporate into their general plans. These plans are created in concert with regional transportation, environmental, etc. plans. How the growth is managed within each city is up to the city of course -- and that's where the NIMBY and rich vs. poor issues are played out on the ground. I find it absolutely challenging and amazing to see (and be part of) the balancing of the various factors to actually govern. There are winners and losers in every decision, and it's important to remember that we're not playing a one-round, zero-sum game.<p>I can't say anything about the state and federal governments -- but it's easy to get involved and make a contribution at the city level, and absolutely will be enlightening. The first step in conquering the ""denial of reality"" problem you complain about seems to me to be understanding how cities actually work, and then working to make some constructive improvements.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.abag.ca.gov/housing-top.html\n  [2] http://www.abag.ca.gov/planning/pdfs/SFHousingNeedsPlan.pdf [PDF]</code></pre>",1338225567

4034164,comment,4033866,4033866,7,0,ReidZB,,,"Fundamentally, a few things are wrong with math education.<p>First, you can advance grades without a full understanding of what you were taught. I'm not saying students need 100% comprehension, but letting someone go up in math with only ~50-60% comprehension is a terrible idea. Math builds, and like Jenga, you can't build without a firm foundation.<p>Math is taught as a set of rote ""exercises"" with loosely- (and vaguely-) connected theorems. Students are never really given an explanation of why something is useful or why they should even care. You're just expected to memorize it, recite it for the test, and forget it until the final rolls around. This is the mindset school has got us in: so many students don't realize the building nature of math before it is far too late.<p>Perhaps the most damning thing about math education is its focus on the what, not the why. For example, the quadratic formula: it is introduced and students are told that if you have an equation ""of the form"" ax^2+bx+c=0, you can ""find x"" by plugging in the numbers. Never are you given an explanation of where the quadratic formula comes from, never are you given an explanation of why you would want to solve a quadratic.<p>In my math classes, I was always trying to figure out the ""why"" behind something. Why were sine, cosine, and tangent all positive in the first quadrant, while only sine was in the second quadrant? We were never told, and most students never even bothered to question why this was so. In fact, when they were told ""all students take calculus"" and shown the pattern, they just happily nodded and thought ""I'll remember that for the test."" But if you understand the real reason behind ""ASTC,"" you don't need a silly phrase to remember it.<p>And, finally, you have the ""exercises."" You're given a generic 'class' of problem, told how to solve it, and move on. Really good teachers will make some cursory attempt to explain why you can solve a problem how you can, but if a student already has been pushed up through a few math classes he should not have passed, it is likely to be well over that student's head. That feeling of mathematical incompetency just makes them tune the teacher out. And all the while, since grades are the de facto measure of your ""worth"" in school, the students are thinking ""this explanation is too difficult: it won't be on the test."" That's a dangerous mindset to cultivate... but the way the system is designed, it doesn't matter one whit.<p>The student can memorize some facts, never understand why they are as they are, and then study the generic classes of problems that will be present on the test. Then the student can ace the test, feel good about his or her self, and move on, all without any real comprehension. But that's the way the system is designed: you can't apply a teaching process that would really give a full education of math to everyone. For one thing, we don't have teachers skilled enough in math to do so. (A chicken-and-egg problem.) So we are stuck with these half-baked attempts at a curriculum, with kids gaming the system to get their A (or whatever standard they set for themselves) and nothing more.<p>It's sad. Math is such a beautiful field, full of mysteries and interesting connections. But thanks to the terrible math education system, the vast majority of high school graduates think math is a worthless field full of arcane formulae jumbled about in a seemingly random way all with no real logical structure.",1338225525

The thing in math is that ""x"" you see can be repeated 20 times in a set of equations. Having to read ""running_total"" 20 times instead is a hindrance here rather than a benefit.<p>The difference between math and code is the number of variables. A piece of code can have an order of magnitude more variables than a set of math equations. But in math, a few variables will usually be repeated many times. You're simply optimizing different usage profiles.<p>So the benefit in descriptive names in code is being able to distinguish easily the many different variables. The benefit in single letter variable names in math is that you're able to write the information in a more compact, digestible manner.<p>The reason this latter point is important is for the same reason short, compact programming languages are a boon to comprehension. The faster you can read a set of related items, the more of it is in your working memory at any given time and thus the better you're able to understand it.

About a year ago halfway through my IB diploma with me failing the maths part of it a number of things happened which have completely changed my perspective of maths. I started loving maths, reading about it outside of school and doing extremely well in the subject. The things that happened which caused this 180 degree turn:<p>a) My teacher sat down with me and explained the WHY. It wasn't just formulas and rules but actual explanations that allowed me to approach problem questions with logic rather than a formula book.<p>b) Khan Academy. The ability for me to go back to the very start and become proficient in the very basics of maths without looking like and idiot and at my own pace was amazing. Some people laughed when I started at the very bottom in khan academy and worked through most of the program but the things that I have learnt and were never taught to me (or I ignored them when they were taught) was just astounding.<p>c) Choosing physics as my main science where I had to use maths to solve real world problems. When I discovered that maths could actually be used in real life to solve real problems I extremely motivated to read more about the formulas and their deeper roots.<p>Now I have graduated high school and when ever younger kids ask me what they should do and focus on I tell them that they should focus on maths and make sure they understand everything when its taught because learning it later when you are on more advanced topics is extremely painful.<p>I think the biggest problem school's today in relation to maths is that we are allowing people to move on in the curriculum with a maths score of 50%. In other subjects it doesn't matter because the content next year isnt based completely on the content of this year but in maths it does. If only I had been told in year 6,7,8,9,10 ""You are going to have to repeat this year unless you improve you maths score"".<p>All it takes with maths is practice and giving kids a reason to learn it other than ""you have to"". Maths is one of the most amazing things I have ever come across in my (short) life and once I truly understood its power, my view of the world was never the same.

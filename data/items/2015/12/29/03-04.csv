It&#x27;s funny, I think Windows 10 kind of got a free pass on some pretty big bullshit (forced updates, extremely bad privacy policies) because people were like &quot;ah, microsoft is harmless now&quot;. Those are things that would have been HUGE ten years ago. Like, windows 10 basically defaults you into keylogging. It&#x27;s not exactly keylogging, but they basically propose uploading your inputs so it&#x27;s pretty similar. I&#x27;m not a hater, but this &quot;new&quot; and &quot;friendly&quot; Microsoft tends to be newer and friendlier when people hold them accountable; they shouldn&#x27;t be getting a free pass on some of this nonsense they&#x27;re trying to pull.",1451361393

Modern Windows is better off without it.  As far back as XP the best option was to install Microsoft&#x27;s own Windows Defender and uninstall everything else, now just use what the OS already comes with.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s goal with virus elimination is to make Windows work better, 3rd party vendor&#x27;s goals with virus elimination are to upsell you on a lot of crap you don&#x27;t need.  It isn&#x27;t difficult to see why the 3rd party stuff is all a bunch of crap that floods you with false positives while bogging your system down in an attempt to seem like it is doing something useful.<p>Yes, there are occasionally exceptions to the rule, but they all eventually follow a logical progression from useful lightweight tool to bloated piece of shit that is worse than most viruses they could possibly save you from.",1451361338

In many countries banks are required to hold a certain amount reserve (I think it&#x27;s about 1.5% in the USA - the UK doesn&#x27;t have such a requirement), so this is simply requiring that the banks have 100%, which means banks can only lend money they actually have.<p>EDIT: Did you mean how does the whole money creation thing work at all?

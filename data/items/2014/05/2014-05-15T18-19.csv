7751443,comment,7751110,7751110,181,0,jbk,,,"This is one of the most important points about DRM.<p>DRM are marketed to users (and the society, including politicians) and to artists as a way to prevent copies. Most engineers implementing DRMs think so too. And all the discussions we&#x27;ve seen on HTML5 are around this. People have little arguments against this because it &quot;sounds morally good&quot; to help artist &quot;live of their creations&quot;.<p>I am the de facto maintainer of libdvdcss, and have been involved on libbluray (and related projects) and a few other libraries of the same style; I&#x27;ve done several conferences on this precise subject and I&#x27;ve fought the French High-Authority-on-DRM in legal questioning about an unclear piece of law... Therefore, I&#x27;ve studied DRM quite closely...<p>The truth is that if you consider the main goal of DRM to prevent copies, no DRM actually work. ALL of them got defeated in a way or another. Indeed, GoT-broadcast-to-top-of-TPB time is counted in a couple of hours; so why do they try to push those technologies still?<p>The answer is probably because the main goal of DRM is to control distribution channels, not copy-prevention. Copy-prevention is a side goal.<p>This post of Ian is excellent to explain this.<p>PS: You can see me speaking of the same point, in French, in June 2013 here: <a href=""http://www.acuraz.net/team-videolan-lors-de-pas-sage-en-seine-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acuraz.net/team-videolan-lors-de-pas-sage-en-sein...</a><p>NB: I&#x27;m not discussing here whether DRM are good or bad.",1400180223

For example, I can have any tv show and movie at my finger tips, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice just to turn on the tv. There&#x27;s something enjoyable about letting someone else make the choice. It&#x27;s the same reason you might have a DVD library collecting dust, but you get excited when one of your DVD&#x27;s appears on television. You just push a button, no decision of which movie to watch, and no taking time to setup a DVD.<p>It&#x27;s similar with the radio. Any song or album is available online, but sometimes I just want to listen to music, without finding a new playlist every hour, or switching songs constantly. Music streaming services online have this covered to some extent, but there&#x27;s something comforting about a box that&#x27;s sole purpose is to play music, and that&#x27;s where the radio comes in.<p>Imagine if you had a box next to you, and all it had was a volume knob and 8 buttons, each for a different genre of music. You push classic rock, and it just starts playing a non-stop stream. Get bored with it? Switch to electronic. Your only choice is which genre, and how loud.

As discussed here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7745009"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7745009</a> common reasons are:<p>1. Monopolistic lock-in. DRM is more than often used to control the market. It happened with Apple in the past, and was one of the key reasons that music publishers realized that being DRM-free is actually better for them.<p>This reason also includes DRM derivatives like DMCA-1201 and the like. It&#x27;s all about control (over the markets, over users and etc.).<p>2. Covering one&#x27;s incompetence. DRM is used to justify failing sales (i.e. when execs are questioned about why the product performs poorly, they say &quot;Pirates! But worry not - we put more DRM in place&quot;).<p>3. Ignorance and / or stupidity (many execs have no clue and might believe that DRM actually provides some benefit). This type can be called DRM Lysenkoism.",1400180048

I can&#x27;t quite place my finger on why, but in Clojure I rarely find myself reaching for something like the state monad, as I would in Haskell.<p>Clojure tends to view mutability as a concurrency problem, and the tools it provides to deal with mutability, such as atoms, refs, agents, channels and so forth, are not mechanisms to avoid mutation, as to provide various guarantees that restrict it in some fashion.<p>It might be that in the cases where I&#x27;d use a state monad in Haskell, in Clojure I might instead use an atom.

One of the goals of valME is to find ways where content consumers can bypass the behemoth publishing and media industries and financially support our favorite content providers directly.  Could micropayments to bloggers, authors, writers, musicians, et al. not only add-up to an important stream of income but also provided significant competition to the publishing oligopolies?<p>I&#x27;d like to see the concept taken even further. For example, search engines: could upvotes/downvotes be used for search algorithm rankings, upending the SEO industry? How about books? What if authors published their books on open platforms where readers could upvote and/or tip the author as they read (e.g., &quot;I really enjoyed that chapter, so I&#x27;m going to upvote it and give the author a few cents/bitcoins&quot;)? How about applied to the king of question/answer sites - StackOverflow? I know there are plenty of SO coders who deserve more than our non-tangible upvotes for the time and effort they saved us. Music? Upvote the song and give revenues directly to the band, bypassing the big media houses.<p>Advertising is currently the primary source of revenue for most websites and content providers. Micropayments based on voting and tipping could change this revenue model. What would happen if it did? Would content quality increase? Would it become easier for unknown content providers to gain visibility? Would search results become more useful? Would companies like Facebook and Google be forced to change their business models? Would copyright legislation become less relevant?<p>Technologies like Updn and valME are about upending the entire revenue model for news, social media, blogs, forums, and search engines - advertising. They could give unknown, quality content providers a real, viable alternative to working for the mainstream media or writing blog posts that aren&#x27;t even getting a few pennies from Google AdSense. They could take power away from the entertainment lobbying companies. They could even help encourage teens to write and create outside of 140 characters, a snap of a camera, or a silly Facebook post.<p>But, philosophically, they can also help encourage a few thoughts that apply outside of what we do online. There is too often a belief that someone should get something for nothing; get something without effort; get something without paying for it; get something without trading for it. People forget that there is always a price for value. They forget that someone, eventually, has to pay. The Internet is a hotbed for reinforcing the idea of something for nothing.<p>We need to reduce the power of advertising dollars on the Web. We need to give content creators a different viable distribution channel to make money in order to reduce the power of copyright lobbying efforts. Directionally, Updn is a great way to do that and, as a competitor, I hope it is successful and we see more like it.<p>[1] valME.io - <a href=""http://valme.io/c/gettingstarted/faq/kqqqs/how-valme-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valme.io/c/gettingstarted/faq/kqqqs/how-valme-works/</a>",1400179446

In Linux around 2002, there was a new many-to-many pthread implementation called NGPT that was backed by big players like IBM and Intel, until a couple of Red Hat developers (Ulrich Drepper and Ingo Molnar) obsoleted it with NPTL and some accompanying kernel optimizations. So at the OS level, a 1-to-1 correspondence between kernel-level and user-level threads seems to be what mature implementations settle on. Also, early JVM implementations for Unix used green threads, but that&#x27;s also now a historical footnote.<p>On the other hand, Go does use green threads, and the main developers of Go are by no means naive. So maybe green threads do have some benefit, but only when implemented in something higher-level than libc and pthread.",1400179062

Rockets are optimized for fuel use by pushing engines and weight to the limit, which is odd because the fuel isn&#x27;t really expensive. If you&#x27;re going to cut down on that in the service of another goal like reusability, it seems like they want some <i>huge</i> payoff in exchange. Thus the shuttle ended up as a fancy spaceplane that could bring entire satellites back from orbit, and Rotary Rocket, DC-X, and X-33 were all shooting for single-stage-to-orbit. I don&#x27;t know how much technology SpaceX is bringing in versus just an attitude that it&#x27;s OK to be suboptimal, that it&#x27;s OK to lose payload to reusability, that it&#x27;s OK to work incrementally and keep throwing away some of your hardware, etc.",1400178239

7751206,comment,7750099,7751042,6,0,nonrecursive,,,"I think you may be misunderstanding a few things, and I hope I can clear them up :) First, the term &quot;pure function&quot; does not imply &quot;ivory tower&quot; any more than &quot;recursion&quot; does. Pure functions are tools that allow you to &quot;isolate mutation&quot;. In fact, Paul Graham mentions that experienced lisp programmers &quot;try to segregate side-effects in a few functions, allowing the greater part of the program to be written in a purely functional style&quot; (<a href=""http://unintelligible.org/onlisp/onlisp.html#SEC27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unintelligible.org/onlisp/onlisp.html#SEC27</a>). So - don&#x27;t let the terminology throw you :)<p>Second, the point of the point of the chapter is to show how much can be accomplished without mutating data structures. I think that&#x27;s something valuable to focus on. Saying &quot;You can do a lot with pure functions and immutable data structures&quot; is not the same as saying &quot;You&#x27;ll never need to mutate anything&quot; and as the author, I apologize if my writing suggests otherwise :(<p>Lastly, Clojure definitely places a huge emphasis on limiting mutability by using pure functions and immutable data structures. I think Rich Hickey even describes pure functions as stable bricks or stable atoms in one of his talks. My impression is that it&#x27;s definitely not the love child of common lisp and java. Clojure is pragmatic, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t place an emphasis on functional programming. I agree that it&#x27;s &quot;not bogged down in a theory of pure anything&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t intentionally designed to support and encourage programming with pure functions and immutable data structures.",1400177900

Every city that overbuilt was extremely bubbly and has had an extreme price drop since.<p>New houses aren&#x27;t being built because the vacancy rate is super high (if you include shadow inventory.)

It was punched card FORTRAN &quot;IV&quot; on an IBM 1130 (scare quotes because IBM&#x27;s definition of FORTRAN IV was so permissive this compiler only have numeric ifs; that is, an if statement evaluated an expression and it had three lines it would goto if negative, 0 or positive).<p>It wasn&#x27;t as bad as it might sound; sure, punched cards were a bit of a pain, and we all knew they were obsolescent (1978-9), but then again it was a chance to learn how they did things when dinosaurs roamed the earth.  But the neatest thing was no computer priesthood for this class: the main computer for the school was an 370/115 (360 series: revolutionary &#x27;60s architecture using discrete silicon transistors and core memory, the 370 series used ICs including for main memory (!), the -115 model was the lowest end/slowest, but it ran BASIC fine :-), and they leased the obsolescent 1130 and just put it in a corner.<p>We&#x27;d put our cards in the card reader, hit go, hit the right buttons or whatever to break it out of an infinite loop if necessary, feed in a boot card if it got really confused, all under essentially no supervision, but good help, of the priesthood in the other corner of the room tending the mainframe.  It also had a console, and an interactive program was one of the projects.<p>Lots of people older than me also cut their teeth on the 1130, Wikipedia has a partial list: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130#Influence_of_the_1130"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130#Influence_of_the_1130</a>  I wonder, if only the university library had a book on LISP; instead it had lots of good books on software engineering, which along with the programming taught me the basics.

On top of this creating a lot of extra work setting up the sends, it skews the statistics on things like SPAM complaints.<p>What caused the account to be banned was that some of the smaller lists would occasionally see spikes in SPAM complaints.

When I examined this further, I find the reaction of the HN community more interesting than the article itself.<p>I&#x27;ve been making a dive into Ken Wilber&#x27;s arguments about modernity, and the differentiation and disassociation of the various value spheres (science, art, and morals). The issues that this news item brings up a lot of interesting and real-world issues to test Wilber&#x27;s arguments against.<p>The vast majority of the news items here focuses on the science sphere, or rather, the technology. Science is values-free. Is technology also values-free? I used to think it is values free. If you make a piece of tech, the tech itself is no good or bad, the people who use them are good or bad. But is it really? I remember reading Kevin Kelly&#x27;s blog post on that, &quot;What technology wants&quot;. It disturbed me at that time because it was a change in some deeply-held world view. I also thought about it some more. Unlike scientific discoveries, technology is inherently in the social domain. There are technologies for which we don&#x27;t have clear scientific theories on, and yet people use them. Technology is tightly coupled to people, and you cannot disassociate the science behind the technology and the uses and moral/ethical implications of that technology.<p>Ken Wilber&#x27;s argument is that, while differentiation of the value spheres leads to what he calls the dignity of modernity, the <i>disassociation</i> of the value spheres leads to what he calls the disaster of modernity. And I think technology is a great place to examine how the various value spheres comes together. It would be irresponsible of the HN community not to consider these together.<p>One of the values at play here in this article is, are these Tesla memorial folks making a fair request from the Elon Musk, or are they opportunists? There are many other articles and stories similar to this, so is this interesting? The issues involved are in the moral sphere. There are no ambiguous uses of technology. Should the community even concern itself with this at all?<p>If this is uninteresting or irrelevant to the the HN community, is that a form of differentiation or is that a form of disassociation? Further, looking at the people commenting on this, people on HN are inclined to think that the Oatmeal plea is somehow violating dignity, that there is already a proper differentiation without disassociation. On the other hand, my reading of the Oatmeal plea is that, despite explicit statements saying they are not trying to force Elon Musk into doing anything, it&#x27;s essentially saying that there is a disassociation, and therefore, part of the disaster of modernity.<p>So while this story may not fit in with HN policy, or with the community values, the story and the reactions to it brings up a lot of interesting things for me.",1400177153

7751104,comment,7750754,7751005,4,0,stonemetal,,,"I believe they are claiming that when minimum wage goes up even people who make above that get a cost of living bump.  Therefore the fact that minimum hasn&#x27;t moved means the whole stack above it hasn&#x27;t moved.  I know this is true for my mother. She has maxed out the pay scale at her current employer\\position.  The only way she will get a raise is if she changes employers or there is a change in minimum wage in which case her current employer will bump the scale by the same amount as a cost of living adjustment.",1400177027

If the police can prove or otherwise convince a judge that the purpose of that metal tube is to serve as a gun barrel, then it&#x27;s a gun barrel. Circumstances would go a long way in these cases.

So yes, they do, especially since they&#x27;re the ones that will become professors some day.<p>> But going to Berkeley gives you access to classes like &quot;Qubits, Quantum Mechanics, and Computers&quot; [1] that are offered almost nowhere else. Those classes can be extraordinarily hard, but extremely rewarding.<p>But there&#x27;s a big problem here as well: such courses, that are only offered every once and a while, fill up extraordinarily quickly, which goes back to the issue of lack of funds and too large class sizes. Getting into any preferred upper division course is difficult now. It especially didn&#x27;t help that I was always behind fellow students in my grade when it came to class registration times because I did not have very much AP credit coming in (my high school didn&#x27;t teach to APs at all).  This meant even some students a year or two below me got registration before me.<p>Another thing: if you wish to inspire students to take the difficult but rewarding classes that you&#x27;re speaking about, having a mostly mediocre undergraduate experience does not help at all. If most of my upper division courses were, in my experience, taught poorly, why would I want to take even more difficult quasi-graduate courses, where poor teaching would be more impactful?<p>In the end, I did choose Berkeley over Carnegie Mellon and other schools. I feel a tiny bit of regret in having done so, only because I feel like a smaller prestigious private school would have offered a better undergraduate experience than Berkeley without sacrificing the awesome opportunities that you&#x27;re talking about. Then again, there are many things about my experience here that I don&#x27;t regret at all.",1400176947

Studios, whether the EFF and others like it or not, are not going to be changing their stance on DRM any time soon.  It seems that more and more media is being consumed on a subscription basis than is being downloaded (see Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu)... People are caring less about owning the content than having access to it.<p>Currently with DRM there are a variety of plugins to support it in the browser.  You have to download Widevine&#x27;s plugin, or PlayReady&#x27;s plugin, or whatever.  It&#x27;s just a better user experience <i>if we really do need DRM</i> to have some standardized DRM that the browsers can implement to make it seamless for the user.<p>Note that I don&#x27;t support DRM, I think it&#x27;s a total waste of time because the movies aren&#x27;t released to the wild by your average Joe who is downloading movies from Amazon. It just serves to hurt the average user.  However I think that if we must have DRM, it should at least be something that is easier and works better for the average user.<p>To answer your question: the difference is that Mozilla is not going out and promoting DRM. They are being pragmatic and reasonable in the less than ideal situation.",1400176871

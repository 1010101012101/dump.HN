3845562,comment,3842038,3842038,2,0,gooderlooking,,,"Web 1.0 was not as beautiful as you remember. Most websites had blinking text, bordered tables, under-construction icons and pictures of cats. Around 1998 people started to realize there was more power than just serverside includes and hypertext links to other URLs (they weren't URIs yet).<p>The problem was, people had to use creative thinking and a bit of duct tape to make it all work. There were battles over valid code vs ""whatever, it works"", and eventually everyone just sort of accepted that standards won't keep up with innovation. That's about where we are today (browsers are getting better at supporting draft-level innovations, which is a hell of an indication of what they think of this stuff).<p>Page loads are wasteful, often reloading and redrawing 90% of the same content just so you can see page 2, and the whole window flashes and spins until its done.<p>Anchors are used for compatibility, and when used correctly, are done so for the very handy fact that the server doesn't need to care about what comes after the ""hashbang"".<p>Yes, bad error handling is bad. But, do you remember spending 20 min filling out a form only to have the next page after submit show an error, ""sorry, the server could not handle your request"", and hitting the back button showed a nice blank form? That's why we do it differently today.<p>Pagination is a terrible UI. ""<< < 1 2 3 ... 7,600 > >>"" is not only useless <i>unless</i> you want the first or last page, it also takes multiple reload and redraws to get anywhere in between (try getting to page 3,475, or even trying to comprehend what is on that page by the time you get there).<p>Client-heavy apps are actually embracing the beauty of hypertext; they <i>don't</i> require you to download and install new mobile apps, because they work in the browser you already have.<p>I think you're romanticizing the simple web and damning web applications based on the assumption that they are all poorly developed. The relevant argument I see is that web application developers should pay more attention to the non-developer, end user experience.<p>I think we're making good progress with ""awfulness.js"" sites.",1334541481

3845559,comment,3845316,3845316,9,0,6ren,,,"I'm very interested in how the business side will work out. On the one hand, it's very fair to make some money when you make something great (and it funds ongoing creation).<p>On the other hand, dev tools are expected to be free and it feeds massive adoption (and if not free, devs have the ability reverse engineer e.g. linux and gcc). The common wisdom is that smalltalk got killed by high prices. There are exceptions: MS VS; some editors. Maybe the older, broader the appeal, and closer to the dev, the greater the pressure for free - so that new, specialized, and close-to-customer tools resist commoditization. Light table is new, but general and close to dev.<p>The <i>Street_Performer_Protocol</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_pledge_system#Street_Performer_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_pledge_system#Street_...</a> fits perfectly with KS. But personally, I love the idea of making something great and getting rewarded in proportion to its greatness (as in product sales), not a fixed reward. An ideal solution seems to be to charge large customers (e.g. over 10 employees? Over 100?), but I've not seen this explicitly attempted... but I guess it's achieved by ""enterprise"" versions, with extra features, particularly those needed only by large customers... that may be what is being considered with <i>""some plugins may remain closed source</i>"". Then one could create a marketplace for plugins, an app store etc.",1334541443

3845532,comment,3842713,3845321,2,0,mattbriggs,,,"My argument is that ending every line with // is just noise, () is just noise, and ; is just noise, except for the one in 1000loc time that it isn't. And filling your code with noise not only makes your code harder to read and longer to type (if even by a little bit), but it trains you to ignore semi-colons, especially since you do not have a compiler complaining when you miss them. And when semi-colons fade into the background, it is MUCH harder to catch the one case where they are important.<p>If you were to write ruby, smalltalk, perl, google go, python, coffeescript or any of the other languages with asi, you find that people omit the semicolons in every situation unless for the few they need them, and never run into a problem. For some reason, that is not the case with js. Do all of those other languages ""abuse"" ASI? I work on a 500k loc ruby app, and I feel very confident in saying there has never been a single case of a bug from an ambiguous statement from asi (although there have been from the difference of && and 'and'), and there is only about 5 semi colons in the whole code base.<p>Now, js is different then those other languages in that it has a quirk where it treats whitespace and newlines the same for all types of brackets. Realistically (if you are writing for the browser), this only comes up in lines starting with an open parenthesis, since that is the one case where starting a new statement on a line with any kind of bracket makes sense. And even then, the one time you are likely to be doing that is for an immediately invoking function (function(){}()), which isn't exactly you do every few lines of code. So you have a choice on how to deal with this one, fairly uncommon case; either handle it in a special fashion when it occurs, or put a semi colon on every other line. I don't care which one you choose, all I ask is you afford me the same respect :)<p>My intent isn't to get into a silly language argument over this, but it seemed like you genuinely missed what I was trying to say. If you feel it would personally help you write better code, then more power to you. But I write a lot of semi-colonless code in various languages, and it has literally never caused a problem for me.",1334540756

I wonder, though, whether the nature of that wall has been clearly written up anywhere.

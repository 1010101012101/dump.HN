3232617,comment,3232420,3232533,9,0,rayiner,,,"> Power is way more concentrated than the founders intended.<p>I'm not sure this is anything more than technically true.<p>It's easy to forget that the Constitution actually created a very powerful central government for its day. The Federalists, at least, envisioned the Constitution as giving Congress sweeping powers over inter-state economic activity, foreign relations, etc.<p>The difference between then and now is that most human activity at the time of the writing of the Constitution was strictly local. You grew your own food, died where you were born, etc.<p>What has happened today is not so much Congress extending its power closer to our day to day activities, but our day to day activities coming closer to the reach of Congress. Nearly every thing today involves a market transaction, often an inter-state one. If you asked one of the founders whether a purchase of a product produced with components from multiple states, in a transaction involving multiple multi-national corporations at the point of sale, was within the scope of Congressional power over commerce, the answer would likely be ""well if such activity isn't within its scope, what is?"" Yet that is precisely the transaction that would occur if I were to go downstairs and buy a Snickers bar from the VISA-enabled vending machine.<p>If you lived today on a farm, self-sufficient, perhaps trading with other self-sufficient people, like it was 1789, I don't think you'd notice much difference in Congress's power over you. You'd have to file a yearly tax return, but the Tax Code doesn't tax self-created value so you wouldn't pay much if anything in taxes. You wouldn't be paying into social security, etc. You wouldn't be using health care services, so that would all be inapplicable. The biggest burden on you would be the collection of state property taxes, just the same as it would've been in 1789.",1321239551

For example, maybe during weekly PM meetings where all PMs gave an update of the projects they were managing, your PM also developed a strong sense of what was going on in the business?  Maybe the PMs attended meetings where the corporate strategy was discussed, which you did not attend?<p>Not recognizing that others may have vantage points that were unknown to me was a tough lesson to learn, but an important one.

3232523,comment,3231781,3232139,11,0,maratd,,,"> So you're choosing potentially ignoring tiny issues instead of letting them crash the system in a visible way and fixing them properly forever.<p>This makes the assumption that I am able to fix them. Few people realize it, but you have very little control over the system. You can easily fix configuration errors, but if the error is due to a fundamental defect in the source code of a critical package, there's nothing you can do. I do not have the time to write patches for every defect in the system, nor do I have the luxury to tolerate them. Quite a conundrum, isn't it?<p>> The second is that there shouldn't be any ""cruft"".<p>There's always cruft. If you plot the uptime for servers, you will find that it looks like a very steep bell curve. Very few servers run for a few days, but also, very few servers run for years at a time. Most run for a month or two, or three.<p>In practical terms, this means that the bugs that get fixed first are the ones that crop up immediately on boot (everyone experiences them). The bugs that get fixed next are the ones that crop up for the average user or the middle of the bell curve (server running for a month or two). The bugs that get fixed last, if at all, are the ones that crop up for the fewest users (server running for years). This article is an example of that.<p>So by running your server for years at a time, you are exposing yourself to a greater amount of unfixed bugs. Also, memory leaks get worse over time and even a really minor one can mean serious issues over the span of years.<p>> The third one is that if you cannot say anything more specific than ""cruft"", then your system is badly managed.<p>I am not restarting because there is anything wrong with the system. It is not a solution to anything. It is a preventative measure. Preventative maintenance.<p>First, if there is a power failure or some other problem that forces the server to reboot unexpectedly, I know it will come back up. I know that because I have designed the system to reboot regularly and I test that capability on every server, after every update.<p>Second, I am avoiding problems that crop up for systems that are operating outside of the average uptime.<p>Third, my servers boot within 1 minute at most. What's my cost for doing this? 1 minute of uptime in the middle of the night once per month? So be it.",1321237026

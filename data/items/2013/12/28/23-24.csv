If you don&#x27;t want or need those things, then C is a perfectly good choice.<p>There are many other languages that raise the abstraction level, but most do it at a performance cost. As for Objective-C, I&#x27;m fully convinced that it would be an obscure niche language today if it hadn&#x27;t been for Apple basing OS X on NeXTSTEP.

There are all kinds of ways to interpret what should go inside an &#x27;article&#x27; or &#x27;section&#x27; or &#x27;nav&#x27; element and people do - you just can&#x27;t trust the hundred million different interpretations of the spec every web developer brings to the mix.

It&#x27;s only good for readability, I guess. Maybe. I&#x27;m not advocating going back to tables, but this is such a piffling little nothing to be concerned about.

Unfortunately Qt is C++ and it&#x27;s not even standard C++. So language bindings are hard to build and (compared with Gtk) working with C++/Qt is not so painful. The bindings for Mono are dead. Trolltech released at some point Qt Jambi, the Java bindings, which were awesome, unfortunately the Java community hasn&#x27;t been interested in it, so Qt Jambi also died after Nokia acquired Trolltech - for the moment at least (the wonderful thing about open-source stuff is that it can be revived with enough interest). The only well maintained language bindings for Qt is PyQt.<p>And yes, building the UI using the platforms native stuff yields better results, but it&#x27;s also more expensive to do so.

Processing power does not appear to scale to allow this, and there will barely by any of today&#x27;s consoles still alive by then (also, I doubt 2060s television sets will have HDMI input).<p>My response would be the trend towards more PC-like architectures (more traditional x86 systems vs something like <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)</a>) and the fact it&#x27;s already  easy to build a similarly priced ($400-$500) PC with superior performance already (historically rare at release than the new set of consoles) may mean it&#x27;s easier to accurately run these games in future than a Nintendo 64 or SNES. On the other hand, the original Xbox (circa 2000) was a traditional x86 system running an only <i>slightly</i> modified Windows with DirectX that as far as I know isn&#x27;t emulated well.<p>I think the search for accuracy will probably be achieved in the coming decades by producing accurate and cheap clone hardware &quot;dongles&quot; to offload processing and interfacing them to a computer via some future fast bus.",1388274656

Maybe rather add a button that opens &quot;advanced&quot; options i.e. more sliders coming into view - white noise etc. Seems a bit artificial but it gives you a way to split off less popular and weird stuff like artificial white noise. Plus delayed loading of those sounds. Adding a drop down or similar would kill the clean layout in my view.<p>Since you reacted positively to the initial feedback:<p>- The share mix button at the top looks wildly out of place. Its outside of the main rectangle and looks weird as a result.<p>-I&#x27;m allergic to the word &quot;share&quot; tbh...consider replacing it with &quot;publish&quot;/&quot;broadcast&quot; or similar. Sounds a bit presumptuous...but &quot;share&quot; has become a seriously craptastic word online - even erotic sites have a &quot;share on facebook&quot; button. If you must have it rather move it as far down as possible - so that users can first toy with the sliders a bit & get a feel for things before being asked to vouch for it to friends.<p>- The colour scheme (stark black white) is not conducive to the tranquil vibe you&#x27;re trying to convey. Best bet is adding some colour hint to it I think. Keep the basic idea, but add some faint highlight colour(s). Think earthy warm colours.<p>- The humans track is way too loud. If you set all the sliders to mid then all you hear is humans. Either lower it as a whole or dampen the 600hz-700hz frequency range gently (assuming my ears aren&#x27;t failing me on that freq guestimate).<p>>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding good audio that has the right feel<p>Yeah.

6977195,comment,6976095,6977001,1,0,loceng,,,"I feel your comparison is apples and oranges, other than that the current structure of Bitcoin gives gain to early adopters, and early adopters / investors in a business potentially allows investors to have higher gains. However they are different systems.<p>Why can&#x27;t the system exist just based on the incentive of the value that system brings? Why can&#x27;t that be reward enough? The issue here is allocation of resources - to build and implement this structure and have it being adopted. The reason this is getting exposure is because businesses can make a profit, in a de-centralized Ponzi-scheme like structure - and with it being de-centralized giving it a huge amount of momentum and putting it to a holistic scale, where there can be lots/&quot;unlimited&quot; players perpetuating the system in different ways.<p>An alternative is the government implementing this system - and then why not the government (society as a whole) make those gains/rewards that occur? And I&#x27;d more imagine an international government than individual nations.<p>What I am trying to contrast it to is how it would look if everyone was already in this system, and then furthermore, if they were all brought into the system at once - having it mirror current resources and ownerships. This isn&#x27;t easy to conceptualize either, as people&#x27;s time is a resource - and what&#x27;s the minimum value of a base unit of time?<p>Yes, giving reward speeds up how quickly the system will exist or seemingly be adopted by people, though it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s actually implemented in a secure and stable way. Its competitor is essentially money, so people who want to keep the status quo of money in place will be a very strong friction against Bitcoin. When people buy Bitcoin with real money, if they are the last ones, what they get from each Bitcoin will be less than what the early adopters do - which I feel is a very large disincentive for Bitcoin ever being fully adopted by everyone. And if 90% of people are now using Bitcoin for transactions, how much is real money actually worth? Those &quot;late&quot; adopters will not have places to spend that money, fewer and fewer, and so they end up absorbing the downside or rather they end up paying for the upside that current investors / early adopters are gaining. Is this wrong logic? If not, how is this fair? Simply saying &quot;don&#x27;t be the last!&quot; isn&#x27;t really an adequate response either. The value of real money won&#x27;t decrease any time soon, though as a system similar to Bitcoin has higher adoption rate there will become a tipping point where people just won&#x27;t accept real dollars in exchange for Bitcoin because they won&#x27;t have as many places to spend it, it won&#x27;t be as easily &quot;liquidated.&quot;<p>The why is so you can create a system that doesn&#x27;t punish or put &quot;later adopters&quot; at a disadvantage. If putting $1 in of current money into the system, and then the equivalent of $1 into the system 5 years from now gains you the same value, then that would be fair and balanced. There being a fixed amount of Bitcoin, that isn&#x27;t structured to be immediately distributed to 100% of existing money, is a problem. It&#x27;s currently structured to be a land grab, where land is a finite resource.<p>Perhaps I am missing some foundational understanding of how Bitcoin works and that is skewing my understanding and answers.",1388274230

If you look a fiat currency it can (and is) produced in whatever volume necessary by the central bank, in order to avoid a fall in prices. Gold has a similar (but distributed) mechanism: when the gold price goes up people mine more gold, increasing the money supply.<p>Note that that property of gold works even if it&#x27;s the primary medium of exchange: if there is too much deflation then an ounce of gold will buy you more goods and services, making it more worthwhile to mine it - which in turn increases the money supply and acts as a counterforce to price deflation.<p>But this is obviously a flaw in the design of Bitcoin, not in crypto currencies generally. It should be possible to create one with potentially infinite supply, but where the cost of mining a coin remains relatively stable over time. Such a crypto currency would be usable as a store of value and as a (primary) medium of exchange.<p>I&#x27;d love to see that &quot;infinite supply crypto coin&quot;, but unfortunately I&#x27;m much less optimistic that it would become as popular as Bitcoin.

Look: roughly 45% of the world&#x27;s gold production is used for financial speculation, 45% for jewelry, and 10% for industrial purposes [1]. In other words, 90% of gold buyers are buying mostly because they believe gold will preserve its value. And &quot;if all else fail&quot; (if speculators exit the gold market), prices will drop, and jewelry buyers will redirect their desire to other precious metals [2], leaving only industrial demand as buyers. Suddenly the world would be producing 10 times more gold than the demand, leaving the prices depressed.<p>And again, Krugman completely misses the point of Bitcoin having value not as a currency, but as a payment processing platform. Overstock CEO Byrne said it beautifully:<p>*&quot;You’re getting rid of the interchange fees. We’re paying credit card companies around 2%. For a company whose margin is 1%, picking up 2% on that is quite attractive.&quot; [3]<p>[1] <a href""http://www.gold.org/investment/statistics/demand_and_supply_statistics"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.gold.org/investment/statistics/demand_and_supply_...</a><p>[2] For the same reason people prefer expensive diamond over cheap cubic zirconia, even though both are practically indistinguishable to the naked eye. Yes they CZ is less hard, but most jewelry buyers don&#x27;t care about hardness. They buy diamonds because they are expensive, that is all.<p>[3] <a href""http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-unveils-more-details-bitcoin-adoption"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-unveils-more-details-bitco...</a><p>[4] <a href""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/23/heres-what-paul-krugman-doesnt-get-about-bitcoin/?tid=pm_business_po"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/23...</a>",1388271911

Just wanted to point out if you&#x27;re trying to make a point about readability / ease of use with code examples, you should try as hard as possible to make each example optimized to avoid accidentally creating a straw man.<p>Also, one criticism of the Ruby version is the invisibility of the types involved. What type is returned by 5.minutes vs 5.minutes.ago? How do I know I can compare the second to a date attribute from ActiveRecord? The Python version is more verbose, but I think it&#x27;s more clear that I&#x27;m using two datetime&#x27;s and a timedelta.",1388271844

I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding good audio that has the right feel, but it&#x27;ll be added at some point.<p>White noise is on the todo list. What I really need to do is make the audio loading more modular. At the moment it&#x27;s very naive and everything buffers at once. I want to create a system where there&#x27;s a core set of sounds that load by default, and then a menu of sounds that expand and load when selected. This would mean I could support a lot more sounds. At present, to add another sample I&#x27;d have to remove something already there, because performance is a little flaky even with just the six current samples.",1388271705

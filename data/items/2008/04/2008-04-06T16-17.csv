The conclusion: the aid tended to discourage work.</i><p>Yeah, that's right. The obvious occurred, as usual. All such theories, and all such fawning articles, rely upon one unalterable precondition: Nobody involved has actually lived among the destitute, while destitute.",1207501169
156213,comment,156177,156177,0,0,jamiequint,,,"Does anyone here know about the economics of gambling? 
It seems like the argument Karelis is making would have strong similarities there. I'd be interested to see if this suggestion is at all valid.<p>To explain, in gambling (think lottery tickets, not poker) you trade $1 for something that actually has less than $1 worth of economic value. There is obviously another component at work (behavioral, not economic), call it hope. If economists have found a way to quantify hope in this context it seems that they could try the same thing with poverty, the results would certainly be interesting.",1207501105
156212,comment,155976,155993,0,0,pmjordan,,,"A lot of this stuff seems really obvious, but having worked in the game industry, the general view seems to be that ""that would all be nice if we could do it"". In particular, the quality feedback loop is often sorely missing. This is why there are so many mediocre to bad games. I suspect the reason for this disparity between theory and practice at most publisher-independent studios is some mixture between the iron grip of publishers on developers, and developers' reluctance to even try to do anything about it. Maybe I've missed something though, few of the politics ever seeped through to programmers. (apart from ""you're not working hard enough"")",1207500962

I have Knuth, but something less thorough covering a wider area may be preferable.<p>8: A book about the practice of programming. My favorite is The Pragmatic Programmer.<p>9: A book about software engineering as a profession (I recommend Peopleware.)",1207500427

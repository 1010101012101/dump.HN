Creatine is not associated with educational attainment.&quot;<p>&quot;The associations between creatine and labour market outcomes are robust to controlling for other biomarkers, educational attainment and parental background. Creatine is a naturally occurring nitrogenous organic acid which supplies energy to body cells, including muscles and brain.

I appreciate that egg cells aren&#x27;t constantly dividing during a mothers life but they are still a product of division and contain DNA that can suffer from time based mutations. So if aging is due to mistakes accumulated during either divisions or time then why are children born young?

Every cell in your body and, indeed, you yourself are part of the original cell&#x27;s lifespan.<p>Second he goes over a lot of experiments that indeed point out the trade-off that God is making here : either you die, or you become a cancerous blob, over time.

He also gives the philosophical reasons why death may indeed not be the end of existence (well it isn&#x27;t, if you have kids, for obvious reasons, but it may also not be the end of your conscious existence for other reasons).<p>Really, this book will change your thinking on death a lot, and after reading it you will understand that not dieing is something that will come with massive consequences.",1396128426

It is the building of fine bridges by Romans and Victorians in advance of material science and computer simulation.<p>To pick one example from the SENS portfolio - by which I mean the list of techniques developed in the scientific community for other reasons and adopted as useful by the SENS proponents - allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes is absolutely a way to fix protein expression issues. It is the delivery of proteins to rescue mitochondrial function. It has been demonstrated to work in mice with no side effects for a gene associated with LHON by two separate research groups now, neither of which were affiliated with the SENS Research Foundation when they started out.<p>This is serious science. You might not like it or be familiar with it, but you&#x27;re missing out.<p>SENS is supported by a number of noted figures in the life sciences, including George Church, Anthony Atala, Judith Campisi, and so forth:<p><a href=""http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board</a><p>There are detailed proposals for the development of therapies involved in SENS.

Kids can learn very short term things, adults cannot.<p>Our brains work by modelling the future, then picking a desirable choice of actions to change that future. What changes when we get older is how far out we model the future. In babies it&#x27;s tenths of a second up to less than half a minute (in foetuses it&#x27;s a few milliseconds up to dozens of milliseconds). In adults it&#x27;s a few minutes to a few months. Everything that gets bypassed by the short time horizon is frozen in place (and is critical for survival, e.g. making your heart beat is one such frozen circuit)<p>For example, walking (and especially running) requires very short feedback loops in your brain. If you don&#x27;t learn how to do it as a kid (yes, sadly that does happen) you will never be able to do it well. Language is another example where you need to learn short feedback loops. This means that language learning in kids is fundamentally different from adult language learning.<p>Kids learn a language. Meaning they learn to express their thoughts in that language. There is no level below that language, and they start thinking like that language thinks. Adults learn how to express one language by using another language and express their thoughts and thinking in the original language, and then translate. This can become really fast, but for example you notice the difference in the number of nuances someone can express if they learnt a language as kids  versus if they learnt the language as an adult. For example, what is the difference in certainty of &quot;I think I heard him say that X&quot; versus &quot;I thought I heard him say that X&quot;. You will notice that native speakers are sure to have an opinion on the matter.<p>This has reverse consequences as well. Kids&#x27; brains only take a very limited future time frame into account, meaning they will never really understand why you do something that will take weeks or months to produce a reward, or why you avoid doing something because it means bad things will happen in a months time. A kid will have a very tough time getting a feel for why buildings don&#x27;t collapse, or generally to work on long term efforts.<p>In short you can switch expertise to longer term things (e.g. music -> painting is probably fine, but the reverse would be VERY hard indeed).<p>It also means that you will very likely blow up your life if you ever manage to reset this particular ageing process. If you&#x27;re married, for example, that will mean nothing to you any more if you manage to reset your time horizon back to minutes to hours.

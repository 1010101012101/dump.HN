946984,comment,946762,946762,0,0,Alex3917,,,"OP is right, and people would see that if they weren't reading it as if he were specifically talking about YC startups.<p>He says: Of companies designed around the sales plan, they rarely fail because of a bad CTO. That's true. It might not seem true looking at student-run startups, but that's because most of them are starting with a product they think people want and then looking for ways to sell it, rather than starting with a sales strategy and then finding a product to match it.<p>The former strategy is very risky, so it only makes sense to start a business this way if you're sure of a huge exit; after all, sales-centric companies still have the option of a huge exit, but they also have the option to become billion dollar businesses without an exit. What's more, being sales-centric isn't mutually exclusive with having a great product. It's true that some great products don't lend themselves to being sales centric, but the point is that if you have the option to choose either a great product that's sales centric or a great product that's not, choose the one that is.<p>Now the technical co-founder is absolutely essential to starting a business where the product isn't sales-centric; the point is you shouldn't start these businesses in the first place, because given a universe with infinite number of projects you should choose the one that's both a great product and also allows for immediate sales. IMHO this is the #1 thing that's currently missing from YCs advice to startups, albeit the present advice generally works because YC specializes in a very specific type of startup operating in a very specific environment and time period. It's kind of analogous to how in the 60s they designed the product around the TV commercial, in that you could imagine people giving similar advice at the time that was too narrow but often worked anyway.<p>edit: And I hope I'm not offending anyone by saying this, IIRC pg actually hinted that they may have to rethink their customer acquisition advice in a recent essay.<p>edit2: What I am trying to say is that the YC advice is incomplete because it doesn't account for the hidden disjunction, which is the same reason most people get the Wason Selection Task wrong: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task</a><p>So the best business is one that 1) starts with a great sales strategy 2) is something people want 3) does not need time or money to invent 4) still has a good barrier to entry. Once you fully map out the disjunction, it's easy to see why selecting startups based mostly on their ability to make something people want may have worked great five years ago, and may still work decently today, but is ultimately flawed and will probably continue to perform less and less well over time. Now it's still perfectly fine to select startups good at MSPWing if that's who YC likes working with, but making that the most important factor for predicting success is probably a mistake; ability to MSPW as a predictor of success is a shortcut, and there's nothing wrong with using a shortcut in some cases, but what that shortcut should be changes over time.",1258484380

Still, I was looking for something different, and I’m sure Ikiwiki is a better solution for certain use-cases. To answer your questions:<p>* No, Markdoc doesn’t require its own HTTP server, but being able to run 'markdoc serve' is helpful.<p>* No, pages can’t be edited via the web. That would require an authentication system, and would introduce some difficulties w/r/t version control (or require some VCS coupling).<p>* The way incremental builds work (at the moment) is that the whole wiki is re-rendered into a temporary directory, and then rsync'd into the HTML root. I’d like to write a 'markdoc refresh' command in future, but at the moment rendering is so fast there’s little need to.",1258484348

That's one of the reasons people like it so much. There's one feeling you get when you're dining out and a friend turns you on to a 10-dollar red that tastes great and another feeling you get when you go to the cellar for a special occasion to get a hundred-dollar bottle -- even if the wines are statistically indistinguishable.<p>What can I say? It's a great product. All of human experience goes into the process: peer pressure, prior experience, atmosphere, cost, anticipated pleasure, etc.<p>When I started trying to learn how to taste wine I went through Wine Spectator and only ordered wines of the very highest rating. I understand this is just an anecdote, but I found that about 1 in 3 were actually distinguishable by me from grocery-store wine. I took that to mean that yes, there are differences, but the amount of signal is vastly overstated.<p>But that misses the point: it's emotional, not statistical.",1258483913

If I run an Apache server hosting my website, it's centralized. Everyone that wants to access my website has to go through my server. They <i>don't</i> have to go through my server to access the whole internet net though. The internet -- for the most part -- is <i>globally</i> decentralized, but <i>locally</i> centralized.<p>It's the same with Bittorrent and trackers.

If you have two groups of 20 peers that are only connected to each other by a single peer, what happens when that one peer goes down? It's now impossible for those two groups to find each other.

  slow or even down—heavy reliance on PEX can lead to the formation of groups of

Verizon was always rock-solid for me:  no dropped calls and much better service away from cities and interstates.  I'm pretty sure Verizon's rural coverage was better eight years ago that AT&T's is today.  I can't compare non-voice service directly, because I only used Verizon for voice calls, but Verizon wins the voice service comparison hands down.  AT&T's voice service is really disappointing in comparison:  occasional dropped calls in the city and limited service in the boonies.<p>Another thing I've noticed:  with AT&T, I've often had difficulty making calls when I'm close to a concert or festival.  This has been annoying since I live a few blocks from a city park that is often used as a venue.

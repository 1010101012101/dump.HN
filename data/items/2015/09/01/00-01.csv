If someone shows you a picture of your wife (to take an example from one comment) and a picture of eg another woman with the same hair color, skin tone, whatever, would you be able to distinguish them? I&#x27;ll bet you would unless you suffer from prosopagnosia, the <i>loss</i> of the ability to recognize faces that we know can occur after damage to a certain part of visual cortex. Then try to describe how you can tell the pictures apart. Not as easy. Artists (like the one in the article) spend all day thinking about faces (ok, not all artists, but many of them). They probably feel more confident in their ability to recognize faces and in their ability to describe them--because they discuss faces for portraits, with clients, etc.\nAs a skeptical neuroscientist, I&#x27;m thinking you should hold off on diagnosing yourself with this condition until we come up with better evidence for it.",1441068558

If your notion of computation is dependent on purpose and thus some teleological notion of function then saying something computes doesn&#x27;t tell us anything about that being, only about how human beings perceive that being and its function. Again, this undermines the usefulness of having a perspective/function independent notion of computation. The magical thinking arises because we project our notations of function onto the being itself and conflate our uses for that being with the intrinsic properties of that being. Purposes/uses/functions are not intrinsic properties. Computation may not be an intrinsic property, it may only be a relational property, which would be an interesting result itself, but probably quite irritating to people who want to make arguments that there is something intrinsically different about certain kinds of systems.",1441068413

The interesting part of the conversation to me is the plateau itself - according to many people, all people and especially individuals are the same, calories in minus exercise equals weight gained (or lost), there is no such thing as flux, every day is exactly the same, literally the only variable is your weight, and that hardly changes at all day to day.  Yet, myself and millions of other people do in fact hit a plateau with no noteworthy change in diet or exercise.

Virginia is a &quot;ban the box&quot; state, meaning it is state law that the state or government contractor cannot ask about a criminal background until a formal offer of employment is on the table. Unless of course the job requires prior to extending the offer (i.e. schools can&#x27;t employ sex offenders, law enforcement jobs don&#x27;t want convicted felons, etc..).<p>2. The Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits job discrimination on a criminal background when it comes to race or nationality.<p>The law seems to have been written with a very broad pen. While I understand there are certain businesses that should not be run by certain convicted felons (i.e. you don&#x27;t want a daycare center run by someone convicted of molesting children), this law seems like it was written to solve a specific problem and needed a very general approach. Comparably, many states/cities do have restrictions on the types of licenses an individual can get based on their background (commonly referred to a collateral consequences of a conviction - <a href=""http://www.abacollateralconsequences.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abacollateralconsequences.org/</a>). For example, some states prohibit the issuing of a real estate license to individuals convicted of fraud.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence or not, but this ordinance came into effect a month after the governor of Virginia signed the Ban the Box law.",1441066873

Now it is pretty much limited to checking Clash of Clans in the morning and at night because it strikes the right balance of brain candy vs. time I need to invest per gaming session.<p>I play a lot of desktop games though still, and I think the big thing for me has been the contrived IAP-focused experiences that have dominated the app store. Finding games that encourage you to continue playing using the carrot (by making the game actually fun) vs. the IAP stick to punish you for playing is a chore.<p>Steam on the other hand seems to be mostly games that are not P2W, and reviews are quick to point out details of any P2W or IAP-hell mechanics.  I&#x27;m more than happy to pay full price for those games and definitely get value out of them.<p>Beyond that, I think I&#x27;ve just reached the &quot;peak gaming&quot; point of my life for now.  I realize that every moment I spend playing a game is giving into my vice and helping me unwind vs. being spent building something or being otherwise productive.  Sometimes I need that to relax, but as I get older I increasingly become aware of the amount of time I&#x27;ve collectively &quot;wasted&quot; on video games in my life.  I put &quot;wasted&quot; in quotes because I&#x27;ve definitely gained a lot of value from it over the years, but it has likewise not produced anything physically tangible to show for it.",1441065952

A lot of democracy is pretty boring, and you&#x27;d want those who we delegate the boring bits to have considered things well, and that takes time. A quick approach would be that you need to make a small payment to your delegate for each vote, but that would have its own effects (e.g. people casting random votes as  they don&#x27;t want to pay someone). So perhaps a voucher system - every vote you make (delegated or direct) gives you a voucher. If there are n votes in a year, then for every voucher you have greater than n, you can claim a certain amount of payment.",1441065911

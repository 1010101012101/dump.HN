Write one plugin and learn by looking at other plugins.<p>On the top of my head:
deluge (bittorrent client)
emesene (MSN client)
XBMC (media center)<p>If you're a Gnome user, most applications support Python plugin (Nautilus, GEdit, ...)<p>Shameless plug on my part, you could make a plugin for my open source project called periscope. It downloads video subtitles from various websites

2127909,comment,2127636,2127636,0,0,jdietrich,,,"""Mac of your choice"" is perhaps shorthand for ""we give developers good hardware"", but I think in the case of Harvest it's a cultural thing.<p>I'm a Mac fan, in large part because Apple hardware embodies what I consider good design - quality materials, elegance through simplicity and a general drive towards purity of form. Harvest describe themselves as a ""design and technology company"" and have a clear sense of how their work ought to look and feel. I would be apprehensive about hiring someone who didn't like Macs because it is likely that we would strongly disagree on basic tenets of design. For the same reason that fashion houses judge job applicants based on what they wear, I wouldn't trust the judgement of a developer or designer who would choose to use a Dell or HP machine.<p>Don't get me wrong, if I'm looking for an admin then I'm hiring the guy with a Lenovo x201s running Ubuntu every day of the week, for exactly the same reasons - your preferences say something about what you consider important. I want to hire front-end designers who can't bear for one second to sit on a bad chair in front of an ugly computer and I want to hire admins that wear utility belts and write device drivers for fun.",1295629086

If you speak of the typical monotheist God (Omnipresent, Omnipotent, Omni-benevolent, Has created our universe, Sentient, Listens to prayers, and sometimes Answers), then the question ""Is there a God"" is both falsifiable and false. (By ""false"", I mean of negligible probability given current evidence.)<p>Religious claims are typically falsifiable, and repeatedly disproved (creationism is a good example).  Every time that happens,  religions eventually back off, keeping only their claims that are not yet disproved.<p>Second, while some topics (like choosing a morality) are definitely outside the scope of science, the accurate description of our world is definitely inside.  If something we could reasonably call ""God"" exist in our world, it's got to have consequences.  I expect science to find out, or at least try.

That's when the company buys the stock.<p>Insider buying is when the insiders themselves spend their own money on the stock. It's very difficult for them to successfully manipulate it upward--if they buy e.g. 5% of the outstanding shares, then to profit from their manipulation they have to <i>sell</i> 5% of the outstanding shares. The net result is likely to be that the stock ends up where it was, and the insiders have just paid their brokers a lot of money.<p>Also, what's artificial about this? It seems natural to me that if there are fewer shares outstanding, the price per share would go up (unless the company was knowingly buying them back for more than they're really worth). And ""artificial"" restriction in supply would be something like paying a group of shareholders not to sell for a certain period, to reduce the number of tradable shares.

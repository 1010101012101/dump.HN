235029,comment,234784,234973,0,0,rms,,,">I truly feel sorry for those who cannot tell the difference between 192kbps MP3s and CDs.<p>Have you listened to a properly encoded ~200 kbps MP3? Under what circumstances can you tell the difference between a proper MP3 and a CD? Do you think you could under double blind circumstances with music you pick?<p>If Neil wants to launch a competitor for HDCD and DVD-audio, great, but I doubt it will be more successful than those. He didn't say what the product actually was, so hopefully he has something better up his sleeves.",1215075078
235027,comment,234784,234973,0,0,akd,,,"I think Neil Young is misguided here. He is a very successful musician and has spent his whole life in sound. Obviously he's going to have a much more finely tuned ear than the general population.<p>But the number of people who are like him and you is not enough to support a new format or business model. Most people can't hear any differences beyond a good bitrate MP3.<p>Consumers over the last 50 years have been on a relentless trend towards greater convenience and poorer quality (look at the quality of any of today's household appliances). A quality play is simply obsolete.",1215074721

235021,comment,234550,234761,0,0,shafqat,,,"Yes, we did that so the initial users dont see the CredRank fluctuate wildly every time someone votes (i.e. go from 0 to 100 to 50). We also felt it was important that everyone starts off as credible (100). We shouldn't be able to decide at the start, because then the entire idea is tainted!<p>BTW, by looking at data and trends from our Alpha, we realized we have to tweak some of our algorithms. So I'll post separately about that for the geeks out there who want to chip in.",1215074235

235019,comment,234777,234853,0,0,swombat,,,"Some of us have an irrepressible need to <i>show</i> the world.<p>You could call it a disproportionate competitive streak allied with over-sensitivity about having been wronged in the past (and there's not a human being out there that hasn't been ""wronged"" by their definition of the term). Combine that with a good dose of competence, skill, talent, etc, and a bit of inferiority complex (which is natural for gifted people, see the ""dots and holes"" article from a while back, link below), and you have the perfect recipe for someone with that irrepressible need to show the world what he's made of.<p>It's no bad thing. That's how most progress was made, I think. Thomas Edison and Newton were definitely both competitive jerks with inferiority complexes. Hardly bad company to be in.",1215074127

Use semantic markup and SEO best practices \n      (http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-web-developers-seo-cheat-sheet)\n  2. Email people and tell them to link to you\n</code></pre>\nGrey hat:<p><pre><code>  1. Buy paid links without nofollow on forums.digitalpoint.com \n</code></pre>\n(not detected by Google yet,  but they'll figure it out eventually because the affordable links are all     spam-like webpages \nthat exist only for the purpose of having pagerank and selling links. For    more money, you can get better links from real sites, or you can hire an SEO that knows what he is doing. Ideally you only pay him for the links and you handle all other SEO yourself, because it isn't worth paying for.)<p><pre><code>  2.

235009,comment,234777,234777,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Why retire after your startup succeeds? Why not just start doing something fun thats is not easily monetizeable? The idea is that you can have some real freedom. You can work on whatever you want. You can start another startup or continue your education or anything you want you can even start a music band or go traveling or anything that you find fun. Thats why people love money. They are a means to something, not a goal. You don't just get rich and then live some happy rich life, you get rich and get to do whatever you like, if you get rich enough, you could ignore laws too. I know a lot of people who if given a lot of money their first reaction would be to buy a lot of booze and celebrate. I have a friend who if given that amount of money would buy a biology research center and just play god with nature. My first reaction would be to buy a turn table and some 70's punk records or something, and then maybe a guitar. People want different stuff. And money gives it to them.",1215073340

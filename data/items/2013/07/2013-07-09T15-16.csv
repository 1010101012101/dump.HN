This goes away with binary.<p>Not to mention this protocol will need to be implemented everywhere and used by everyone. This means everyone will need to understand it as well. Open text-based protocols support these requirements simply by being open and text-based.<p>As if there&#x27;s not enough bad code around already, in any language not assembly/C/C++, the reduction in code quality and clarity, and amount of additional issues involved the second you change the word &quot;text&quot; to &quot;binary&quot; is staggering. Let&#x27;s not go there if we don&#x27;t have to.<p>Most debuggers today can dump strings fine. Dumping binary, while not impossible, brings extra hurdles. Putting hurdles into debugging, pretty much means you will end up with more buggy code.<p>As if that&#x27;s not enough to make think &quot;hmmm&quot;, there&#x27;s the issue of future-proofing and extending the protocol. That is much easier to do cleanly in a text-based format. A binary HTTP 2.0 will be brittle and short-lived.<p>> We don&#x27;t examine raw bytes by hand<p>Because that is very, very impractical. And thus making that a de-facto necessity for working with HTTP  2.0 doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>I say we should look at it the other way around: Considering everything a binary-format will cost us (just some of those mentioned above), what benefits does it bring us to justify this huge cost?<p>I say the answer to that is near <i>none</i>, and in an ideal world that would be the end of the discussion.",1373385483

6013268,comment,6012525,6013183,8,0,fusiongyro,,,"My main objection is that the name you call something does matter. SPDY is a very different protocol from HTTP, which addresses a very particular set of concerns. It diverges quite a bit from the &quot;intent&quot; of HTTP. This is all fine and good until you change the name from SPDY to HTTP 2.0. One expects 2.0 of something to continue the same philosophy and motivation that produced 1.0. When that doesn&#x27;t happen (R6RS is another good example) you can expect some pushback. In this particular case, the &quot;label swap&quot; nature of the process is generating animosity from those who feel that the process has been co-opted by people trying to pull a fast one. I don&#x27;t think SPDY is intrinsically wrong, I just don&#x27;t think it looks like a natural successor to HTTP. I wouldn&#x27;t expect HTTP 2.0 to address every known problem with HTTP at once, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect at least a few aesthetic improvements.",1373385257

Although I&#x27;m a fan of A/B testing, I&#x27;ve found myself confused/concerned about timings.<p>I was reading Google analytics docs on multi-armed bandit experiments for A/B testing.
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en&ref_topic=2844866<p>In summary, assuming 100 visits/day and 4% conversion rate (CvR) with page A, a scientifically significant experiment for page B to say that the new version actually generates CvR of 5% will require 66 days with the multi-armed approach, or 223 days with the naif 50%-50% approach.<p>To me, even 66 days seem an enormous amount of time for an early stage startup (say, 1k-to-100k users, 10% active users, growing at 5%/week), where decisions need to be made in a few days. Assuming you can pay for ads, you can probably increase the visits/day, but then the CvR drops down. 
So, unless you&#x27;re testing a really bad A page vs a really good B page, I can&#x27;t figure out an example where the time required is acceptable (say, max 1 week).<p>I was wonder if anyone has real numbers that also satisfy a more theoretical appetite ;)",1373385250

Business logic rightly belongs in [insert your programming language] code.<p>Data logic, however, is worth thinking through. When you have a lot of calculations that may span multiple tables, or need fine-grained access control, or require multiple reusable result sets that would benefit from being indexed and delivered to a user (versus attempts to map all this through ORM objects or pulling out raw data and then transforming it in app code), or require querying and packaging the same datasets (or combinations thereof) to share them with other systems that access via ODBC, utilizing functions, stored procedures, and database views are there for a reason.<p>That some ORMs make it difficult to leverage this functionality does not speak to the lack of need for separate data logic and taking advantage of database capabilities. If all you&#x27;re building is CRUD apps with a pretty face, then you likely don&#x27;t need it. If, however, you&#x27;re building pretty complicated systems, pulling out more raw data than you need to calculate a result that could be calculated and kept up-to-date in a database is far easier and reusable. Moreover, ORMs often sour in the face of very complicated data requirements that are rather trivial to setup in a view, function, or stored procedure.<p>As far as onboarding is concerned, in my humble opinion, if you are bringing in new talent to deal with data who do not have a strong understanding of SQL, I&#x27;d be pretty wary of far more significant problems developing as a result of not being familiar with what the ORM is doing behind the scenes (and of what performance tradeoffs are occurring).<p>As far as troubleshooting is concerned, if you can confirm that the data is leaving the database as expected by data logic/code--and this is as simple as executing a query, function, sproc, or view--then you can at least limit yourself to discovering where the offending business logic is located.",1373385168

6013247,comment,6012450,6012450,33,0,mrbrowning,,,"So, I want to preface my comment by saying that I think this video is really well-made and entertaining, and that it&#x27;s a decent attempt at making serialism accessible to a wider audience than it&#x27;s traditionally had.<p><i>That said</i>, it&#x27;s littered with inaccuracies that I don&#x27;t think we would tolerate if this were one of Vi Hart&#x27;s math videos. Most egregiously, I think, is that she wrongly ascribes some of Schoenberg&#x27;s dogma to Stravinsky: Stravinsky never had much to say about the desirability of conditioning children to understand dodecaphonic music intuitively (Schoenberg may not have either -- if I had my copy of <i>Strunk&#x27;s Source Readings in Music History</i> on me right now I could verify this, but if I remember correctly it was either Webern or an unrelated third party who promulgated this particular vision of the ascendancy of avant garde music), nor was he particularly committed to using all twelve tones in his tone rows -- <i>Agon</i>, one of his most famous serialist works, employs a seventeen-tone row at one point [1]. Early on in the video, she selects a tone row at random and sort of dismissively asserts that no one would be able to tell the difference anyway. This is frustrating, because masters like Schoenberg did in fact order their rows to ensure not only structural but <i>sonic</i> coherence, using techniques such as hexachordal combinatoriality [2]. Now, that&#x27;s not to say that these considerations are audible to most listeners -- one of serialism&#x27;s greatest failings, in my opinion, is that much of its content is only discoverable on paper even by highly trained musicians -- but it&#x27;s certainly audible to some, and it&#x27;s worth noting that this runs counter to her assertion that musical lines don&#x27;t have meaning until they&#x27;re embedded in a harmonic context: it&#x27;s not even true with serialism as practiced! It&#x27;s certainly the case that many melodic lines can make sense in multiple harmonic contexts, but the idea that melodies imply their supporting harmony has been a foundational concept in Western music since at least the Baroque, and to counter otherwise is absurd -- otherwise we would be unable to comprehend the harmonic movements of e.g. a solo flute piece. This gets at my major frustration with this presentation, which is that to present serialism as merely a fun and basically arbitrary means of constraining your artistic output is deeply hostile to the reasons for why the technique was developed and the music that people made with it. Maybe you&#x27;re rolling your eyes at this level of nitpickery, but the fact is that it&#x27;s reasonable to expect someone who&#x27;s posturing as an educator to have a better handle on the source material than I see here.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten flak from people for pointing out problems with her videos on music before, and I wonder if it&#x27;s just because we don&#x27;t have enough respect for music as a discipline to want to hear it when someone gets things wrong. For that reason I want to reiterate that this my criticism here isn&#x27;t hostile, it&#x27;s not meant as a takedown, but as someone with stakes in the material being presented I don&#x27;t want to see it being presented inaccurately.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agon_(ballet)#Music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agon_(ballet)#Music</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatoriality#Hexachordal_combinatoriality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatoriality#Hexachordal_co...</a>",1373385044

People only look at HTTP when they want to troubleshoot without any tools. With real tools, you can find out what&#x27;s broken much quicker. And there&#x27;s plenty of things you can miss without a real HTTP interpreter. Most hackers prefer to think of themselves as wizards that can spy 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s and tell you what the weather is. It doesn&#x27;t make for a <i>better protocol</i>, though.<p>Second, we can already break HTTP responses up in multiple parts, using a novel idea called &quot;multipart&quot;. It sucks and nobody has used it since HTML/JS found new ways of providing content. <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html</a><p>Third, it&#x27;s a hack. If you want to improve the protocol, improve the protocol, don&#x27;t just hack onto it to make it do what you want. I could make a horse and buggy go 60mph, but would it be a good idea? How about just designing a better buggy that is intended to go 60mph?<p>Fourth, fixed-length records are the <i>wave of the future!</i> It solves crazy problems like header injection and request integrity checking. Moreover, it makes for simpler, more efficient parsing of requests.<p>Fifth, redundancies introduced from the beginning of time need to go away, like terminating every record with &quot;\r\n&quot;, or passing the same headers on every single damn request when once should be just fine for a stream of requests. Little inefficiencies like this don&#x27;t go away if you just hack onto the same old protocol forever.<p>Sixth, the flow control improvements can make different applications more efficient by both not having to hold state of where and when traffic is coming and improving flow across disparate network hops.<p>Seventh, as to a general question &quot;why use binary when we can compress stuff&quot;, what is smaller: a string of bits, or a compressed string of digits? Add to this that every header could have a 32-bit identifier (4 bytes) and you&#x27;ve got more efficient compression than gzip. Of course, most people would argue that you don&#x27;t save enough time or bandwidth or cpu cycles to make a difference, but it <i>would</i> make for easier-to-write parsers, which would make working with the protocol in general more attractive. But then you have your binary-detractor-wizard-hackers and the whole conversation becomes an infinite loop.",1373384537

It seems to me that it distills to a couple simple points:<p>* SPDY depends on Deflate compression, and will require middleboxes to implement deflate to route requests. I think the &quot;IETF school of design&quot; has an irrational fear of good compression and I think it&#x27;s harmed other protocols, most notably DNS. I may be poisoned into this viewpoint by Bernstein.<p>* There are protocol constants that PHK doesn&#x27;t know the background of, which strikes me as the kind of documentation bug that something like an HTTP 2.0 would address.<p>* SPDY might have required another WKP, which isn&#x27;t really a SPDY problem.<p>* There&#x27;s DoS potential in SPDY --- but of course, there&#x27;s DoS potential in HTTP too; look at chunked encoding, for instance. For that matter, modern HTTP 1.1 also accommodates compression; when it comes to attack surface, in for a penny, in for a pound.<p>* A similar argument addresses PHK&#x27;s concerns about the (theoretic) security of the push model, which is also something that modern HTTP accommodates.<p><i>Later:</i><p>Oh oh also: PHK sees HTTP 2.0 as an opportunity to correct the session management problem, which has led to the &quot;bass ackwards&quot; design of heavyweight signed cookies in web applications. I sympathize with him on this point, but it&#x27;s not HTTP&#x27;s fault that this happens. HTTP 1.1 cookies also used to be simple opaque session IDs; heavyweight signed cookies are a consequence of server app architecture, not the underlying protocol.<p>Even if HTTP 2.0 had built-in robust session management, Rails apps would still be shoving several kbytes of encrypted state out to web browsers.",1373384074

I can accept that offering only web APIs leaves much more room for streamlining the lower layers of the stack. Maybe a future Firefox OS phone will run a new processor that was specifically designed to execute JavaScript.<p>And perhaps my earlier point about HTML+CSS and web layout engines being designed for documents, not UIs, was too handwavy.

It is not enough that other officers may be identified who formally maintain a higher rank, or possess responsibilities of a greater magnitude. If that were the intention, the Constitution might have used the phrase &quot;lesser officer.&quot; Rather, in the context of a clause designed to preserve political accountability relative to important government assignments, we think it evident that &quot;inferior officers&quot; are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.</i><p>The reason Rehnquist gave for seeing military court judges as inferior was that the military reports directly to the Secretary of Defense:<p><i>Congress used similar language in establishing the Department of War, repeatedly referring to the Secretary of that department as a &quot;principal officer,&quot; and the chief clerk, who would be &quot;employed&quot; within the Department as the Secretary &quot;shall deem proper,&quot; as an &quot;inferior officer.&quot; 1 Stat. 49, ch.

You write tests in a different mindset based on expectations, rather than when you are implementing the production code where you are more concerned with the details of logic, etc. Unit tests also tend to be a bit more readable than the actual implementation logic, and so act as a nice form of documentation as a side-effect. In this way, test-first development provides a more gradual transition between a specification or design and the end implementation, which results in fewer missed requirements, allows for easy refactoring, etc.<p>This is of course only related to TDD however, not unit testing in general.

6013058,comment,6012676,6012676,8,0,samwilliams,,,"> The glycerinergics are those molecules that can bind to what is known as the &#x27;glycine binding site&#x27; of a particular subset of stimulatory receptors (NMDA), and it seems that by stimulating this binding site the overall signalling is increased.<p>&#x27;Glycerinergics&#x27; has only one result on Google - this article. Even if we assume that they mean it in the same way as we talk about GABAergic or dopaminergic drugs the definition they have stated is fundamentally incorrect. Glycerinergic drugs would be those that bind to any of the same sites that the endogenous molecule glycine binds to - not necessarily just NMDAr sites, this is an over simplification. Further more, to say that NMDA receptors are inherently &#x27;stimulatory&#x27; is frankly ridiculous. Ligands can be either agonists or antagonists at a given binding site - examples of non-excitatory NMDAr binding drugs would be the arylcyclohexamine family (PCP, Ketamine, PCE etc) and Dizocilpine (MK-801). Finally, &#x27;overall signalling is increased&#x27; is almost laughable. &#x27;Signalling&#x27; through which neurotransmitters? In what manner? How is &#x27;overall&#x27; measured?<p>While I may not have an absolutely perfect understanding of psychopharmacology, I do know enough not to trust this article - particularly when it is taking about drugs with very little history of human use.<p>If you are considering using the drugs in this article, it might be advisable to question why. Just because a compound is new, does not mean it is going to be better or the effects more desirable than it&#x27;s predecessor(s). Of course it is possible that it could be, but it seems likely that in reality you are simply exposing yourself to unnecessary health risks for minimal reward. Would it really be so bad to use Piracetam for a couple of years while the phenyl derivative&#x27;s action in humans is not well documented? Consider your health and the potential gains carefully and make a rational decision.",1373382748

Who would then lower their prices yet again.<p>You do have the right idea about free markets correcting itself, in most cases. But a truly free market would result in all the German companies going out of business with the result being almost all panels coming from China. That would be bad for Germany but good for China. The reason to get in there to regulate that is because, under a truly free market, it would be possible for one region to totally decimate another region&#x27;s economy due to numerous social and economic differences between the regions.<p>Think of locusts. They fly to a crop, eat everything, and fly away. Good for the locusts but bad for the farmer.",1373382087

6012994,comment,6011659,6012807,4,0,Yoric,,,"> There is already no vendor lock-in with html based apps on Android or iOS. The complaint people have about iOS is that it is locked down with regards to native apps [...]<p>We agree on this point.<p>The strategy chosen by Mozilla with FirefoxOS, for good or for ill, is to standardize upon the subset of applications that have no vendor lock-in, i.e. the html based apps, and then to progressively extend the set of capabilities granted to these applications, while still avoiding the lock-in. Other open mobile OSes make different choices (e.g. Ubuntu mobile), and I personally wish them success. The future will tell us which one, if any, of these attempts to make the world a little more open will succeed.<p>> I want to be able to write software for my device and have full access to the hardware without some third party being able to decide what I can and can&#x27;t do with my phone. FirefoxOS doesn&#x27;t get me any closer to that goal, in fact it&#x27;s a step backwards. Web platforms are great for SV startups where raw user numbers are the most important thing, but to be honest I don&#x27;t give a shit about the ability of the latest photo sharing startup to &#x27;exit&#x27;. I do care about people doing much more interesting things and all I can see is web based OSs being a restriction on that. Think about how you would feel living in a world of Gopher based operating systems.<p>That is an interesting point. As all new generation, high-level platforms, FirefoxOS opens some doors and closes others.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know your personal interests, your experience, or exactly what low-level code you want to write, but that reminds me of something I experienced quite a few years ago. At that time, the newly released Windows 95 killed a number of low-level libraries that I had carefully hand crafted using assembly code and BIOS calls and that let me read/write floppy disks with custom formatting, hence guaranteeing that nobody could read my floppy disks without my consent (they could not be ported to Linux either, of course). It also killed my low-level asm-based libraries for direct access to the video card, the libraries that had taken me years to complete, and that I could use to write smooth 256 colors side-scrollers.<p>Well, I survived that loss. A few years have passed. Now, FirefoxOS is the first platform I have experienced in which I can write a small game prototype in about 2 hours. Some doors have been closed, others have opened.<p>It may be that FirefoxOS is not the platform of your dreams, if your dreams require you to go low-level. But I believe that, for most of us, FirefoxOS is pretty damn good.<p>> >As you may recall, we (not just Mozilla) did this to the web a few years ago, and look where this brought us all<p>> Yes, a world where I don&#x27;t control my own data anymore, it lives on some server I can&#x27;t access, subject to the whims of foreign governments. Being processed by code I can&#x27;t even reverse engineer never mind read the source or modify. This is great freedom for developers and governments, but utterly disastrous for the freedom of users.<p>While the dangers you describe are very real, you seem to forget the situation we avoided  one in which every single communication on Earth had to go through Microsoft, using proprietary code and protocols, with contagious DRMs & authentication on every single one of your documents, with a single company deciding of the tools at your disposal both for office work and for development.<p>The fight is far from over  it may never be  and the Mozilla community is part of the frontline, but the open web was a considerable push in the right direction, one that at least gives us a fighting chance.",1373382067

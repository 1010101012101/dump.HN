I moved here from Nepal 4 years ago and Facebook is a great way to be in touch with my high school friends. Maybe I like to keep an eye on what people are upto :) plus, lots of event planning and chat communication happen in facebook now.

1581193,comment,1580144,1581169,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I went ass-over-teakettle once on a tenspeed in Amsterdam traffic, I was very much in a hurry (trying to catch the train to work) and rode faster than the car traffic, a guy turned right into my 'lane' and I hit the front brake in a reflex. Too hard, I flipped right over and bounced off the pavement after doing a salto. Bad scrapes everywhere, fortunately nothing more serious than that (I used to be made of elastic, if I tried that today I'd be dead). I never realised that you could do that until it happened.<p>I was 'right' too, but since swerving wasn't an option and my front brake worked a bit better than expected I wonder if there would have been a better way to handle this (sliding sideways for instance). Accidents lurk in remarkably small corners. My nightmare scenario for a fixed gear cycle would be downhill at a good speed with a sudden obstruction. That would be the 'perfect storm'.<p>Glad to hear your wife is fine, bicyclists are on the bad side of any close encounters of the third kind with other traffic.",1281106741

1581169,comment,1580144,1581045,0,0,lutorm,,,"I've never bought the front brake argument. As a bicyclist, motorcyclist, and physicist, I know that 100% of your stopping power is on the front brake, exactly because (as you say) the front brake can make you do a forward flip. This means that all your weight is on the front wheel, and the only thing you can do with your rear brake is make the rear wheel lose traction, and <i>that</i> will indeed make a bad situation worse.<p>The answer is to become proficient in the use of your front brake and commit the proper brake pressure to muscle memory so that you do not grab at it and skip the front wheel before weight has shifted, or do a ""stoppie"". <i>Practice maximum braking from speed, it could save your life!</i><p>There is one counter-argument to this: In situations with poor traction (on snow, ice, sand, etc.) you don't have enough traction to shift all your weight to the front. In those cases, the optimal case is judicious use of both brakes. But if you bike on such surfaces, you have much more to learn anyway...<p>Second lesson: People rely too much on brakes. In most high-speed situations, swerving is a better action. (Due to the way braking distance vs turning distance scales with speed.) <i>Practice change direction quickly to avoid obstacles in your path!</i><p>Sorry for the long post, but it was fresh in my mind: My wife got side swiped by a car turning right yesterday.

1581122,comment,1580650,1580650,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Life is not fair objectively but there is the belief that it _ought_ to be fair. That makes a big difference. It is part of the common sense protocol of interacting with people. _Most_ people will assume that life ought to be fair, they also assume that others assume the same thing.<p>This belief in fairness can be exploited by sociopaths and those who end up in power. Of course, one can argue they ended up in a position of power because they exploited others' ""fairness"" expectation.<p>This probably has implications for how crime and punishment is treated by different cultures. The strong belief in a universal justice often gets used by the penal system to punish criminals in proportion to how much ""retribution"" the victim (or their family) demands. This is usually veiled in a some kind of a ""the victim's family needs closure"" type argument.<p>At the same time, I think, this revenge based justice is a result (and a perversion) of a universal  religious justice that many members of the society have (had?). The idea that life is fair even beyond life, and afterlife is a place where retribution and rewards are dealt with.<p>It is interesting how for such a Christian nation, America has such a harsh penal system -- one would expect all those Christians to just let the criminals be punished in the afterlife.<p>EDIT: some syntax errors, clarity",1281105473

1581047,comment,1580619,1580619,0,0,Jd,,,"Fantastic article. Hits the nail on the head.<p>Shortly after the announcement of Google Wave I flew out to the Bay Area for the introductory hackathon. I was intrigued, in fact fascinated by the idea of a federated protocol layer to replace email, something that could empower collaboration and community building by distributing power across multiple nodes, instead of the overly centralized and unsecure model of Facebook or the defunct mode of email. A new form of communication was desperately needed and Wave seemed to bring together all the missing pieces for what could be a new era in computing and collaboration.<p>While most people talk about the product when they speak of Google Wave (as at the Harvard Business Review ), they show their lack of appreciation for what Google Wave was below the surface. Fundamentally, ultimately, Google Wave was a new way of looking at the world. It was in many ways a protocol with no particularly good interfaces, largely because it was so ambitious and because efforts were made to popularize Wave rather than finish promised work on core functionality.<p>This is unfortunate. While I was upset when I first read of the decision to “kill” Google Wave, I now feel that there is, in fact, even more potential. Approximately a month ago the Google Wave Developers blog promoted a new independent attempt to create a Google Wave powered online forum. Despite the recent announcement of Google Wave’s death, it seems that many people were inspired by Google Wave and will keep development moving forward.<p>What will they create? Surely, some concepts (like online facebooks) require time to be appreciated and understood, but this is all the more reason for persistence, not giving up when there is no immediate response to an unfinished product. Sadly, it seems Google’s CEO never understood Wave. It was not a clever product, it was a vision in search of a product. And this unmaterialized vision that required more than a keynote speech, bit of marketing, and hope for rapid mass adoption.<p>Hopefully Google will remain true to its original promise to open source the “lion’s share” of its code, including a working server and client. It is understandable that Google would take the great innovation started with Wave and roll it into its own products, but how can they say the problem is “user adoption” if they never delivered the tools originally promised?",1281103711

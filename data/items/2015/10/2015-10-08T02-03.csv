10350689,comment,10350167,10350167,0,0,dennmart,,,"When I moved to the Bay Area (Berkeley), I had to take the bus to work, and I hated it because it was so unreliable. The AC Transit bus was never on time. A bus was supposed to arrive at my stop at around 8:15 AM, but instead it arrived anywhere between 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM. It also was supposed to pass once every 30 minutes but oftentimes I waited a full hour before another bus came. The last straw came when AC Transit went on strike in August 2010 - that&#x27;s when I decided to buy a car.<p>When I had to commute into San Francisco from Berkeley a few years later, I took BART into the city, and didn&#x27;t fare much better. While the trains were on time more often than not, there were way too many delays when we were en route. Since the underwater tunnel between Oakland and SF is a choke point - just two tracks - whenever there&#x27;s a delay in there and you were behind it, it would take at least an extra 15 minutes to get us moving again. The BART strike from 2013 was also pretty bad for commuters.<p>I lived in New York and have been to Osaka, Japan many times, and I don&#x27;t mind public transportation at all in those cities - they cover a lot more ground than the Bay Area, have plenty of trains and buses and aren&#x27;t too affected by delays when it happens.",1444273161

10350685,comment,10347063,10348254,0,0,honestcoyote,,,">but the right for an evangelical Christian to avoid people they see as ultimate sinners who could soil them and send them to hell for eternity is completely disregarded and not tolerated at all.<p>If there are any Christians who actually believe this, then they clearly have not read their gospels. Jesus, in word and deed, emphasized being around people who are sinners. The only people he ever pushed away were those who were abusing religion for their own gain.<p>And entrance to Hell is not gained by being around or talking to sinners. If this were true, Christianity would have died out because its members would not have been able to talk to anyone outside the group, and therefore would have had zero converts. The reasons for going to Hell vary based on what part of the Bible you read or what theologian you favor, but all the reasons can basically be summed up as the individual rejecting God in some way. People aren&#x27;t sent to Hell just because they picked up cooties from some random sinner.<p>In short, your example is incredibly ridiculous and has no theological basis. Yes, some Christians separate themselves from the world. Some enjoy playing the &quot;holier than thou&quot; game. Even for people like that, none of them would think they were in danger of eternal damnation for spending time around a gay person.",1444273111

It&#x27;s better in 2, but still not as straight forward as React, where your child components are simply import/require statements that you can follow through to either an installed npm module, or a relative path.  I try to avoid DI in JS wherever possible, it&#x27;s almost never needed, and there are almost always simpler ways.<p>My second largest complaint on angular, is that I find that the way it handles state (though many are moving to a more react-like approach) leads to anything outside of the &quot;angular way&quot; being <i>very</i> complicated to work around.  The fact that $scope.apply() is a thing kind of sums it up pretty nicely.<p>For most applications (we&#x27;re not all building facebook level interactions), either comparison approach is not a performance issue in practice.

In fact, Cryptomove is not a service -- it is software that anyone can employ to build either private store within one server, or spread out between several servers as long as they can connect via TCP/IP and have access to mounted disks with directories.<p>I do not know internal implementation of backblaze or other storages. But Cryptomove architecture allows for the saved data to be broken apart, and for encryption and movement and of the resulting data parts. When one forces the access to a disk through which the parts move, or even to a memory of the server through which the part moves, there is practically no way to know which part belongs to which original file. This way, even if the attacker gets a hold on the data, there is no easy way to find where the data of interest is. The idea is for Cryptomove to be the last line of defense -- even if the data is stolen there is no way to know which data is which. Even if one freezes all servers involved (one actually needs to know which servers are involved which is again a very hard task), the sheer amount of parts with encrypted names makes identification task very hard.<p>I have chosen pbkdf2_hmac_sha256 for key derivation because it is described as a hash generation function with very low probability of collisions and reversing. Cryptomove had chosen Nettle because it is free open source low level cryptographic library.<p>When the file is saved, the client daemon encrypts data parts using user the keys generated from the user supplied password. After these parts are mutually XOR-ed and bit-scattered, they are directed to the servers. Then these parts get encrypted with the server password on each server during its forward movement -- each server encrypts the part on top of the previous server encryption. Actually, after the part is encrypted, it immediately moves onto another server, so that getting the part on a server knowing that server password is useless -- the part has been encrypted on a different server. ON the way back, the part gets first decrypted, then re-encrypted again.<p>When the part is restored from the store back to client following the &#x27;get&#x27; command, it gets decrypted on the way back by each server, and finally all parts get decrypted by the client, which reassembles them back into the original file.

Of course, these are approximate numbers and it is definitely possible that your dataset is almost exactly like the ones they trained their model on.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly simple to make your own model.<p>1. Label your data with brat:

# 5 days for 2k one page documents.<p>2. Tokenize data with nltk/spaCy. Come up with features and label using pycrfsuite:

# 1 day<p>3. Do more labeling, retokenizing, neural embedding from word2vec&#x27;s similar words to the tokens you have, tune parameters or come up with better features such as your own dictionaries of entities, etc. Retrain the model.
#2 weeks.<p>4.Done. Now you have a memory efficient fast model tuned on your data. You can label anything you want. Not just Person/Company, but things like car vs bicycle brands, computer parts, obfuscated email addresses, etc.",1444272444

10350619,comment,10346811,10347365,0,0,crdb,,,"Whilst I agree with the feeling, I think a lot of BI devs have a tendency to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>Decision making is a complex process. The graphs and data fed to the executive via BI are just inputs to the deep net of his brain, which has been trained on the &quot;data&quot; absorbed over decades of experience. The objectives themselves are not simple to model - management is a delicate balancing act between competing stakeholders. The job of the BI professional is not to just produce what he is told, but to figure out what problem the person making the request is trying to solve, and then solve it in the simplest way possible. Occasionally this requires teaching them some things.<p>Taking an example: imagine you have an engine vibrating normally. You want to set up an alarm that rings if the engine vibrates abnormally - specifically, adding a new frequency to the existing signal (maybe it indicates a screw is coming off or something). You can feed the signal as is to your algorithm, or you can put it through a FFT in which case the &quot;signal&quot; is just a bunch of peaks at each frequency, and your algorithm is literally just a switch (if peak at frequency f reaches amplitude A, trigger alarm). The switch is orders of magnitude simpler, cognitively, than the algorithm that is fed the raw signal; it&#x27;s also likely to be more accurate. Feature engineering is almost the most important part of statistical learning.<p>The executive is like the alarm - pre-processing the signal is your job. They are used to simple tools, usually univariate and linear, at a stretch, some can deal with simple polynomials. The better you pre-process the signal, the easier it becomes for the executive to make a correct decision by associating the new data to whatever decades of experience he trained his brain on.<p>A concrete example: let&#x27;s say your CMO has asked you to give him vouchers and new customers for the last 6 months. He&#x27;s clearly trying to establish the relationship between his voucher campaigns and new customers. You can give him the vouchers and the new customers, daily/weekly/whatever, and put it on a nice Tableau graph and give it to him and forget about it... or you can confirm that the problem he is looking to solve is indeed the relationship between his campaigns and new customers.<p>At which point you ask why new customers? And you find that he has a theory that gaining new customers is the best way to increase revenue, and the objective of the company is to increase revenue (due to incoming fundraising round whose valuation is based on revenue and revenue growth), but it is short term cash flow constrained (hence looking at vouchers instead of, say, marketing spend).<p>Since he probably doesn&#x27;t know that a model can have more than one variable, you explain that to him and brainstorm what other variables might impact revenue growth. Assuming you&#x27;re trying to predict new customers per income statement dollar and new customers per cash flow dollar, you might find that online marketing spend and season are two significant variables, and that there is a significant interaction term between vouchers and marketing spend of certain types. It&#x27;s now your job to explain that &quot;formula&quot; - standard error of coefficients included - to the executive, and brainstorm what output is required to make him be able to quickly check how this input has changed over time (which might just be.. an alarm). You&#x27;ll also have to explain the measure of fit you are using (R-squared almost always wins by virtue of being very intuitive).<p>And of course, this is what I identify as the gap that none of these BI products can ever hope to fill. You need someone technical with full grasp over all the data sources of the company - AND the implicit and explicit data model of the business - who also happens to be continuously involved with management discussions and at least moderately aware of the business. Most companies have a set up whereby the BI team is some sort of self-service restaurant where the executive swoops in, gets his request processed, and swoops back out. Many prefer hiring young, inexperienced BI staff because BI is seen as a cost centre, and because the way they &quot;scale&quot; requests is by adding headcount. One offshoot of this is that the executive starts wanting a Tableau, something will all the data neatly prepared that can be drag and dropped into the 1-dimensional models that he uses to pre-process his company data.<p>The upshoot is that it&#x27;s not that executives are stupid, but more along the lines of GIGO. Without the tools required to make sense of the signals they receive, executives cannot make the right decisions even if they have the right experience and thinking. I suspect a large part of why more experienced executives are smarter is that they learn to spot trends over decades of experience based on very simple signals; for example, an experienced hedge fund manager will sniff out a fraudulent company much faster than someone who has just started, just by looking at the financial reports.",1444272041

Your bridge analogy reminded me of this article that came up here around the same time:<p><a href=""http://www.dev9.com/article/2015/1/the-myth-of-developer-productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dev9.com/article/2015/1/the-myth-of-developer-pro...</a><p>Considering making it my current reference for explaining this stuff to managers I meet in a short time and with a quick link. I also agree the software crisis largely came from the cheaper <i>unit prices</i> of hardware, complexity exploding in software to take advantage of it, and many management issues. Also inspired Wirth&#x27;s Law where he made the same observation while trying to avoid it himself.<p>Only inaccuracies I see are these:<p>&quot;When programming is being done effectively, you automate all the repetitive parts, which dramatically reduces costs and timeframe, but dramatically inflates the unpredictability.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t just do that. The 4GL&#x27;s, the <i>good</i> ones, did that with great productivity benefits in the common case and ability to call custom code for the rest. Many programming aids do today, too. So do the languages offering good macros. However, the methods I advocate here do more than that: support designer&#x27;s understanding of what system does; find high-level issues in requirements or specs; find interface errors (critical); prevent all kinds of things by construction; detect others; enable easier portability with native efficiency; ensure executing code matches source. Just a few recent examples and with each requiring human effort. No amount of programmer skill in C with ad hoc requirements/design techniques replicates these without considerably more effort or the most experienced, elite programmers.<p>So, the tactics and tools from Comp Sci + High assurance/integrity field certainly have value beyond automating tedium. These also tend to <i>increase</i> predictability once people are used to them because they reduce risk and the debugging that follows. The trick is to choose just the right ones that boost the developer&#x27;s abilities without bogging them down. I don&#x27;t have a single recommendation there as (a) one must use best tools for the problem and (b) they experiment too damn much in Comp Sci to the point that I can&#x27;t say whats better for <i>most</i> methods or tools. Only what&#x27;s worked and for what. So, the specifics I bring up change depending on topic & audience. Eventually, we&#x27;ll see some convergence with more uptake. Like how Amazon&#x27;s using TLA specifications now with results I predicted when encouraging that sort of thing for years.<p>&quot; The &quot;crisis&quot; is that it costs literally a million times more to write the code than it does to make the processor. &quot;<p>Here I believe your overall point is hardware, unit cost vs developer cost along with what leads to. I agree with that. Just wanting to make sure you know that line isn&#x27;t true in general as many programmers think it is. Hardware development is <i>expensive</i>, esp CPU&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been pushing on Schneier&#x27;s blog and elsewhere a number of CPU modifications that eliminate entire classes of errors (eg code injection, leaks). Most of them have prototypes to draw on or are specific enough for opencores crowd to handle. Yet, you see almost no attempts to put them into an ASIC even when people know about it. That goes for opencores stuff, too, for most part. That&#x27;s because hardware development is ridiculously expensive even for adding a block or two to a RISC CPU with prototypes.<p>The reason is mainly the mask costs, tooling, and labor. The masks, which are necessary for printing chips, for 350nm-180nm (minimum useful) are $100+k per design test. Wafer and packaging might be $5-10k. Every screw-up requiring a change means new masks and maybe 4 months waiting. You minimum staff of 3-5 pros, as rookies make too many mistakes, will set you back same amount if not Asian and with tools that start around $50k a seat <i>on low end</i>. For hardware that&#x27;s smaller or faster, all those variables go up dramatically with tools for deep submicron (esp synthesis) runnning $1+ mil a seat plus needing four or five different tools. Sometimes more than 10 on most advanced nodes. Your CPU was probably made on a node where one prototyping run (think unit test) of your HDL code cost $1+ million dollars.<p>There&#x27;s tricks to keep costs down, mostly software-inspired as you guessed. Adapteva probably the best at it using pre-proven I.P., simplicity in custom stuff, re-use of it in future iterations, HW&#x27;s version of structured programming, cheapest tools, utter pro&#x27;s for team, and customers willing to pay significant, unit prices. Still cost them $2 million. Most SOC&#x27;s costing $15-50 mil. I managed to come up with flows, open and proprietary EDA, for anti-subversion of open, secure hardware. Found shortcuts like S-ASIC&#x27;s (eg eASIC, Triad) got it down to like $400,000 but with volume requirements. Still high. RISC-V Rocket processor, etc are happening because academics get paid in grants, get EDA tools for low five digits, and get discounts on ASIC prototypes. They&#x27;re our best hope for OSS, secure chips. But I hope I&#x27;ve illustrated HW is in no way cheaper than software except in unit price of something where demand spreads out development costs to make it low.<p>Note: Microcontrollers you cite are a special case not like the rest. Developed by pro&#x27;s, very limited functions, cheap tools, much reuse, on fully-depreciated fabs often owned by the vendors that reduce itereation costs, and in such ridiculous volume that further reduce costs. Even the cheapest fabs with your tiniest design will charge you $3,000+ for the minimum order. When has a compile-and-test cost you that much? ;)<p>With that foundation laid, I can then say your CPU is going to cost way more than the software. Especially if it&#x27;s Intel, AMD, or IBM: full-custom for top performance, power efficiency, density. That requires more of the best engineers, more time, and more masks ($1+mil per set) on the best nodes. The inevitable logic screwups and their respin cost require extra tooling, both commercial EDA and custom, to counter the problems: Intel uses formal verification [1], IBM mostly falsification [2]. I&#x27;m not sure what your CPU cost vs the software on it as numbers are hard to come by. I do know that Solaris 10, a whole UNIX rewrite, cost around $200-300 million while the Cell processor cost IBM $2 <i>billion</i> to develop. Intel spends $10.6 billion a year on their product lines with most on hardware end. So, Standard Cell hardware is more expensive than software with full-custom plus high-end specs being insanely expensive.<p>So, it&#x27;s probably best for that old meme to die since the world has changed and shit much more expensive now. Your points about effects of unit price vs developer cost still stand and all. I just wanted to make sure you knew just how hard hardware was today & at what prices. Plus, there&#x27;s always the tiny chance that a smart guy like you reading these posts will say &quot;Challenge Accepted!,&quot; then build a secure, surprisingly-fast processor for us on an older node. :)<p>Note: +1 for the reference to Engelbart. His videos prophetically talking about (and illustrating) remote collaboration, etc were some of the most visionary things I&#x27;ve ever watched from the field&#x27;s history. Mind-altering to look back at them trying to look forward and getting a lot right for the time period. Very specific stuff, too.<p>&quot; No, anybody can learn how to program. &quot;<p>VERY TRUE! I try to remind everyone that doubts it. More tools and ease of use today than ever to get started at whatever level they&#x27;re comfortable with.

The basics are really as easy as breaking things down into steps and building them like Legos.

But as it requires massive, long-term infrastructure investments that disrupt the city and can bankrupt companies or even municipalities if it goes wrong, it&#x27;s usually built in a subpar manner on a small scale trying to fit into an existing city, and then tries to iterate on that every few years by scaling it up and modernising it while having to work with old permanent structures. So a lot of public transport really sucks, either they&#x27;re buses that are less flexible than your car but adhere to the same space and speed limits, thus making a car a better idea, or they&#x27;re small rail projects that don&#x27;t get much coverage or frequency.<p>But now imagine the corollary... a city with just small sidewalks, bicycle lanes and public transportation lines, and absolutely 0 roads for cars, and no real local car industry. Now imagine the cost of breaking down buildings, laying massive amounts of road, manufacturing new cars and teaching everyone to drive. It&#x27;d be just as tricky.<p>There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with public transportation but implementing it right into existing cities isn&#x27;t trivial. It&#x27;s supported so much because we long for a good implementation, public transportation done right is cheaper, more efficient, reduces congestion, improves equality & access to affordable transport, is safer and more environmentally friendly, while also giving all of its occupants the ability to do something else than paying attention to not getting into an accident. We long for that and support public transportation not because it&#x27;s so fantastic but because it could be better than what we have, and should.<p>It&#x27;s not like that everywhere. Take Belgium for example, expanded its infrastructure and its public transport use doubled between 2000 and 2012, doubled (!) in half a generation. Beijing&#x27;s subway alone, a city of 12 million, delivers around 9m trips per day, forget the bus lines. There&#x27;s already a ton of congestion, the mass transit system is hugely popular and hugely important.<p>Anyway I feel it&#x27;s distinctly an American (and say an Australian) issue. Most of the developed world (take Europe or say Japan) consists of very dense urban areas, and a whole bunch of nothing. The US is like that, too, but there&#x27;s still a ton of urban sprawl and even extremely urban areas like LA have lots of low-density living. Public transport&#x27;s economics are essentially usage / investments, and building infrastructure to reach large areas of low-density (and thereby low-usage) living is not really worth the expenses. So you get this sub-par network where you have to wait half an hour for a bus that takes you to the centre where you have to move to a different one, it just isn&#x27;t feasible. But take New York City, 8 million people and more than 5 million daily trips on the subway alone. It&#x27;s extremely well used and hugely important, just like it is in Beijing, or in London or Paris. I&#x27;ve either visited or lived in all those places and the subway was indispensable, a part of life. But most people in the US or say Australia don&#x27;t live in density like that.<p>Anyway the article felt a bit thin... It spends about an entire page on the notion that &#x27;despite a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for transport [doesn&#x27;t mention this money goes to both public and non-public transport and isn&#x27;t necessarily always earmarked, either] public transport actually declined by half a percentage point&#x27;. I mean that&#x27;s not analysis, it&#x27;s just a tiny little fact that could mean anything. Again, for one we don&#x27;t know how those funds are spent. And secondly, those funds may be a tiny fraction of the necessary budget for maintenance and scaling infrastructure with a growing population.<p>Anyway I think self-driving cars will nail public-transportation first. The type of investments necessary to set up rail, tram, rain or even bus service aren&#x27;t trivial, but a fleet of self-driving cars and people inside working in privacy and comfort on their laptops in comparison is. For new cities, or countries where insane projects can still get done without decades of bureaucracy (I&#x27;m looking at you Beijing metro line) massive public transportation is a huge deal. But trying to reinvent the American city to accommodate public transport (and cycling infrastructure) done right (which in a dream world would entail destroying a city like LA and magically spawning a denser version of it in its place so that public transport works), in the context of American politics... I give self driving vehicles a much better shot of working around that problem.",1444271487

I always associated it with going entirely without food for some vague amount of time that was probably some consecutive number of days. But three weeks ago, after some Googling, I began what is called &#x27;intermittent fasting&#x27;. Since it&#x27;s only been three weeks, all I can say personally about the benefits is that I&#x27;m still doing it and have no plans to stop in the future, but I <i>can</i> say that by the third day, the hunger issue was negligible.<p>The first Google result on the term is pretty good: <a href=""http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fa...</a><p>At its simplest, for men it means eating all your food for the day in a roughly eight-hour window, often noon to 8pm. (There is apparently some scientific thought that women may have significantly different needs; I <i>really</i> can&#x27;t speak to that.) In practical terms, this translates to &quot;skipping breakfast&quot; and avoiding midnight snacks. This turns out not to be that difficult, but has definitely had an positive impact on me, <i>so far</i>. Discomfort-wise for me, I tend to get a bit of a rumbly tummy around 10am, but generally it subsides pretty quickly and even by 11am I can easily go for another couple of hours without even thinking about lunch if I get busy. It is far from constant hunger. (But I won&#x27;t lie and say it&#x27;s <i>zero</i>... just, negligible. Literally. It can easily be neglected and it will in fact go away.) I can also say that I&#x27;m hardly watching the clock in the evening and trying to judge whether it&#x27;s the crack of 8pm yet or not... I often eat at noon-thirty or 1pm and then dinner at 6pm and am done thinking about food for the day, without any willpower expended. It just happens.<p>I say this mostly to point out to people that there is something to investigate that they may have misconceptions about, as I did. I will fully and up-front admit once again I am not in a position to extol its benefits particularly. (I like to do something like this for at least a couple of years before I do that.)<p>(But I will go slightly out on a limb and say that I would not be all that surprised to discover that &quot;intermittent fasting&quot; has somewhere between 80-120% of the benefit of the scientifically-studied high caloric-restriction diets, with much lower willpower and discomfort costs. It turns out that if you dig into those, we&#x27;ve really only studied &quot;normal (modern) diet&quot;, &quot;heavily calorically restricted&quot;, and sometimes a particularly unrealistic fasting schedule (see link), so if you&#x27;re interested in a point in the middle of the two we&#x27;ve studied, you&#x27;re sort of scientifically on your own. Hence the possibility I cite of 120%; currently it would fit the two data points we have just fine for it to turn out that &quot;caloric restriction&quot; isn&#x27;t the optimum and is in fact overshooting.)",1444270952

10350484,comment,10350167,10350167,0,0,WildUtah,,,"It&#x27;s impossible to design a community at any reasonable cost where a large fraction of people are expected to drive cars unless you make all other forms of transportation impossible or impractical.<p>The space needed for most people at an office or business to park free is greater than the total space the buildings will occupy. The buildings need to be father apart to limit traffic density. The roads need to be wider and run faster and therefore be louder and more dangerous than pedestrians will like. the walking distances increase and increase to accommodate the buildings farther apart and the empty space needed to control traffic. Transit routes and stops cannot get close enough to destinations in those conditions and transit times explode. Denser centers surrounded by less dense land uses become impossible when parking is necessary; density has to even out and that makes efficient transit routing impossible while hub-and-spoke systems drastically increase wait times.<p>Transit stinks in America and it&#x27;s not the result of bad transit planning or lack of effort to build more or bad maintenance and operation practices. (Though we do also have those problems.)<p>On the other hand, a transit oriented community will have land values to high anywhere you want to go that ordinary people will never be able to afford to pay to park even with massive parking subsidies. The transit community makes widespread driving as impossible as individual car-oriented design makes transit.<p>In the USA, personal motorcars are the rule everywhere because it&#x27;s the law. The (second) Roosevelt administration propagated rules to the banks and communities that required car-oriented development everywhere in the nation. Then traffic engineering and urban planning and zoning &#x27;professions&#x27; emerged to implement and force those rules on every property developer. It became an iron triangle: drivers won&#x27;t pay for parking, city planning councils won&#x27;t upset drivers, engineers force pure car-oriented development on both to keep the peace, and transit users don&#x27;t have political power by definition or they&#x27;d have used it to get themselves cars already. Today you can&#x27;t build in America unless you can prove that even on the busiest hour of the busiest day, there will be extra free parking for every person that might want to use or visit the property. You can&#x27;t build unless you can prove that the roads are big enough to accommodate every single person who might come in a car or pay to expand the road.<p>The result is that quality transit, outside areas built up before Roosevelt, is impossible and cannot develop.<p>This is the essential reason that San Francisco and New York are so expensive. Car oriented space is awful to live in. [0] There is a limited amount of legacy walkable urban space grandfathered in America. They aren&#x27;t making any more of it. Millions more people want to live there than ever can.<p>If it were allowed to redevelop Peninsula or East Bay cities at low urban density like SF (75 people per hectare), then developers would do it and it would be possible to rent a spacious apartment for US$1500. At medium urban density like Tokyo (150) or high urban density like famously liveable Paris (300), you&#x27;d only need one or two cities to change the rules to relieve the regional problem. You&#x27;d have to build a transit system and accept the lack of free parking, of course.<p>The reason most of the world doesn&#x27;t have the same problem is that the American system demands extreme Soviet-style centralized command-and-control dictation of land development. Parking minimum requirements are the most powerful rules making things bad [1] but floor-area-ratio maxima, separate use zoning, wide feeder streets and traffic engineering, and &#x27;green area&#x27; buffers hurt, too. More free-market oriented development patterns prevail in less regimented societies without such dense thickets of rules and car-oriented development cannot gain a foothold against free organic urbanity.<p>[0] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=pkmluwVdwx0C"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=pkmluwVdwx0C</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf</a> See also Shoup&#x27;s The High Cost Of Free Parking book.",1444270282

I live in Melbourne, AU and to get to work (CBD) by car would cost my on an average 2.5 times more and take twice as long then sitting on the train (not including car purchase and maintenance costs).<p>It&#x27;s a godsend compared to being stuck in the traffic (can work/play on laptop/tablet), sleep or talk to someone if I&#x27;m bored (usually same people travel regularly on the same line during the same time and in the same carriage). All in all I can have a good 1.5 hours of semi-productive time when using PT. The opposite is true if I were to use a car. Utter waste of time/money.<p>PT is the only way to go but this heavily relies on the infrastructure in place and how reliable the system can be. I used PT in Chicago and Boston for 3 years and hated it. By the same token living in Asia (Singapore for example) where timetables don&#x27;t even exist on some lines because the trains run so often and regularly was fantastic. Melbourne falls somewhere in the middle, good services hampered by old infrastructure (some signal stations have been operational without an upgrade for the last 100 years!!!) and frequent air-conditioning breakdowns in hot weather.<p>The problem with PT is that most of us associate it with smelly, crowded, unreliable and expensive alternative to car ownership. But it does not have to be that way. Once you try a well designed and reliable PT solution there is no going back, trust me!<p>Also, IMHO buses are way worst then trains as a mean of transportation (may be why some many people hate PT). Every time there is maintenance work on my line and buses replace trains temporarily I prefer to work from home.

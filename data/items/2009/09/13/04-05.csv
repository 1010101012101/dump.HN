He'd wear v-neck, designer shirts even though he was supposed to look homeless.<p>Then he'd cry a lot, and say, ""And I normally never cry, but this has gotten me so emotional.."" Which means he probably cries all the time to make himself look sensitive.<p>And he spread out his giveaway, which made the episode boring. Where other millionaires gave $100,000 per person, he'd give multiple people, $10,000.<p>All around bad episode. Now I'm mad..",1252817500

This is some seriously fucked up advice. if someone were to ask me what language he should learn first, the answer is Python. When ""Then the new programmer asks what language they should use for web programming"" the answer is <i>still</i> Python - use Django with  its awesome documentation and uber friendly community-  (and PostGres as  a database).<p>This steers them clear of <i>two</i> terrible (but popular) pieces of software, PHP and MySQL.",1252817210

You don't need to tie it to people who bought the album on iTunes.<p>I understand your point about music moving into the background when you're at a computer, and agree to some extent, but I think that's more to do with the fact you are sitting in front of an entertaining multi-function device rather than on a couch in front of a dedicated stereo system. It is possible to set up the latter even with a computer, and you'll still be distracted by all the possible activities with your computer even if you have a bundled web site to look at.<p>I agree that it's good to have something album-related to look at, to allow you to concentrate on the music more.

Ignoring the TicketsNow conspiracies, which I'll elaborate on at another time, Ticketmaster doesn't do secondary tickets directly from their main site until an event is sold out.<p>They can't list specific tickets (sections, row, seats) for purchase - they assign it all to you after you pick a price level or section and enter the Captcha crapshoot. But I have to hand it to them, they did a really really good job on their new design.<p>The main problems with the secondary ticket market are fees, stigma and safety, which are our three main priorities.

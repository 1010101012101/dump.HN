2996490,comment,2995539,2995539,1,0,brittonrt,,,"I really do like this idea, not because it does anything new (as other's have mentioned it's easy to do this on plenty of existing venues like youtube), it's more to do with the community you could build around this.  If you could find a simple way to match users with coding sessions that are relevant to them, you'll have no problem building a community.  You absolutely must allow videos to be stored (not just watched live), indexed, commented on, rated, tagged, etc if you want to make this useful, imho.<p>If I could go to site, search for ""best way to write a y combinator in c++"" or something similar and get videos showing people doing just that but sorted by user rating, I would be a happy boy!  I love when other users do the hard work of telling me what's good and what isn't.  :)",1316012345

I think that would have been pointless, a total time waste and money down the drain.<p>Eclipse may be bloated, but it is available right now and on all platforms too. It means that I don't have to buy a Mac to develop for Android, which in turn means that the barrier to entry is lower for me. It was also available from the get-go. Apple has spent years on improving XCode. Google just had to release a plugin. Apple spent years building a community of people around XCode. Google just inherited it.<p>Btw, there are benefits to creating a Java-compatible ecosystem, one of them being that if you don't like Eclipse, you can always switch to IntelliJ IDEA.",1316012292

What will be left are women who DO want to be mommies.  With the current situation, that change might take only 100 years.

Windows key switches between panel and old style desktop.<p>Forgot to include but at the beginning of it they mentioned spell checking everywhere. I think they meant in every textbox.<p>See 2:39 onwards for someone actually using windows 8 to see the new UI.<p>There's quite a few quality of life improvements for power users and programmers, including:<p><pre><code>  - Task manager overhaul, much better
  - Can 'refresh' PC, restore defaults while keeping all your files and settings
  - Can Reset PC, completely wipe all settings and files
  - Can set a new baseline for the reset image, i.e. after you've installed your go to programs, VS, SQL, etc.
  - Windows assessment console included, internal tools to test computer performance in particular setups

Then there is the very loud gurgling noisealmost like your hungry but 100x louder and disruptive.  Try sitting in a meeting when that kicks up.  Then there is the 10-12x trips to the bathroom and the issues with rawness that comes with it.  Dont forget about the constant, and I mean constant, pressure associated with having to go.   It becomes very hard to translate the pressure vs the real thing.  This is one reason they recommend carrying a backup set of clothes just in case.  These are just some of the side issues the real issues are the pain and cramping.  During a flare you basically shed the inner lining of your intestine.  Painful, irritating and interesting to pass.  Your intestines are inflamed and you feel bloated in a weird way.  You feel full and eating is the last thing you want to do.  Your diet shifts to low residue foods  which equates to nothing fibrous and could pass through a straw.  You get very tired as it is physically and emotionally draining.  You dont eat because it hurts, you dont sleep because you are getting up 2-3x a night to go  or try to go.  I could go on and on.  
In the end its unlike any other disease.  It has a huge impact on a very core function required to sustain life.  It is difficult to describe and convey to a healthy person.  There is no cure other than removal of the colon and the medications to get you by are very expensive($850+ a month) and come with their own set of issues",1316011299

My marketing copywriting intuition tells me that may be clearer / more compelling than people having to do the math themselves. It also gives them a more tangible goal to shoot for and story to tell themselves.

They might want to focus on building tools for something like NativeClient or Dart, and focus more and more on those in Android.<p>Also, looking forward to the hardware-accelerated and improved version of the emulator, hopefully coming out in the same time with ICS this fall.

The emulator would probably work even faster directly on ARM. It might be a year or 2 before we see quad core Cortex A15 machines or machines with Nvidia's ARM-based Project Denver, but we'll get there, so they should make development tools for ARM, too.<p>They should focus on bringing serious productivity tools to Android, like IDE's and such, so people could really use an ARM Transformer like clamshell as their main computer in the future.",1316009155

I don't know how willing the google's decision to permit advertising of prescription drugs was, but I am assuming they went with it because there was no precedent for such a thing in the past (the article mentions this as this is the first time a search engine being held responsible). But I hope and am almost certain that google won't do such a thing again. We will see.<p>Your example of child porn and crack is taking it too far and I am sure no such thing will happen. But if you want google to be enforcing all the laws for you, then maybe it should also detect your location and disallow all merchants catering to gay marriages in the search results, in states where it is prohibited.<p>Also I don't agree with your generalist approach to corporations that they are all equally evil. I for one would prefer a corporation which makes a bold statement about its policies being non evil and one which is ready to be called upon when it goes astray its path, than one which makes no such claims.

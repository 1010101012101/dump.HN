1928566,comment,1926402,1926402,0,0,KazimirMajorinc,,,"Newlisp is my favorite Lisp dialect. Before that I used Scheme and before that, CL. I prefer Newlisp because combination of dynamic scope and fexprs is conceptually simpler and more expressive than combination of lexical scope and macros. If reader doesn't believe me, he can check what Thomas Lord wrote on Lambda the Ultimate site, <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3640</a><p>He really understood fexprs well. Or John Shutt's disertation. Or, this part of Alan Kay's interview: <a href=""http://kazimirmajorinc.blogspot.com/2010/02/alan-kay-on-fexprs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kazimirmajorinc.blogspot.com/2010/02/alan-kay-on-fexp...</a><p>Criticism of Newlisp? Well, yes and no - but, the point of every Lisp is, and particularly NL is - if something is missing, add it for yourself.<p>Picolisp is similar to Newlips, it is really minimal, very fast interpreter, written in assembler.<p>Other dialects have other advantages. But I'll stop here.",1290394758

If I were a non-cheating student in that class, I would be very tempted to confess anyway, out of fear that I would be a victim of the prof's over-confidence in his statistical analysis. He mentioned being able to supply the dean with a list of people with 95% confidence that everyone who cheated was on the list, with no apparent concern for any false positives. The confession offer is pretty good in comparison.",1290394694

1928541,comment,1926515,1927636,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Cheating in this definition is using someone else's work to benefit yourself and by definition the teacher cheated too by using someone else's questions to form ""his"" alleged test.</i><p>That is a bizarre definition of cheating and shows that you don't understand the point of testing at all.  The point of testing is to measure (perhaps crudely) students' understanding of what they are supposed to learn in the class.  The teacher's job is to administer a test that does this effectively, and if a test bank helps him do his job effectively, he should use it.  In this case as in so many others, it is perfectly appropriate to use someone else's work as a resource to improve one's own work.  In fact, as long as one is honest about attribution, this is highly desired.  Test materials are unattributed, and sharing is the assumption, so it isn't dishonest or unprofessional for a teacher to draw from a bank of questions when composing a test.<p>(Students are claiming that the professor said he created the tests himself, but even if he drew the questions from a test bank, he was still deciding which particular facts and concepts were most important to test.  Maybe he said he composed each question himself -- that would be a lie.  However, it wouldn't be a lie for him to say he created the tests.  It is standard for teachers to compose their own tests but unusual to aim for originality on each question, unless it is an essay test with a small number of questions.)<p>Why is taking a test different from creating one?  If the point of the test was to create a big stack of papers with the right answers on them, it would be appropriate for the students to collaborate and use any resources to accomplish that goal.  However, that is not the point.  The point is to measure each student's understanding and help decide how much credit each student should be given for their understanding of the material covered by the test.<p>When students cheat, they subvert the purpose of testing.  By hiding their cheating, they dishonestly claim credit for understanding they did not achieve.  The professor's job is to administer a test that will test student's understanding.  It is not his job to demonstrate his independent powers of test-writing.",1290394100

To know more is to waste your time.<p>In other words, you should do the bare minimum to get by. Well, everyone's motivation for getting a degree is different, and you are welcome to this opinion. However, if this is also your life philosophy, then I think you may be disappointed.<p>Now, I personally agree that this instructor was lazy. However, in a perfect world actually every single iteration of a class would use the exact same exam. This ensures that every student who ever takes the class is graded in the same way. However, some students retake the class and share exams, so this is not possible.<p>It's like if you're a magician and you have an awesome magic show. Why make up a new show for each new audience?

It uses the internal merge-join functionality of AppEngine, which as the name suggests takes two queries and joins them together.  Problem is the the merge join has a very small time limit.  I forget the exact timeout (it's undocumented), but it's something 500 milliseconds.<p>The problem we ran into with the merge join functionality was the following:<p>Let's say you're searching for ""lcd monitor"", your code could do a search for lcd and monitor then merge the result (select * from ngrams where ngram in ['lcd', 'monitor']).  There are many lcd monitors so the merge join will find 1000 results very quickly.<p>Let's say you search for ""dell monitor"".  Unlike the previous search, there aren't many dell monitors but there are lots of dell products and lots of monitors.  Your merge join will timeout because there isn't enough time to perform a query for dell and another for monitor then merge the results because of the internal merge-join limitations.<p>Also, it was VERY expensive to index every document (our data is in a constant flux) so we decided to use a different solution.",1290391694

While some may go to the extreme of saying that MBAs are poor startup founders, the majority lie in another camp: that business school may be the <i>wrong</i> school to learn to be an entrepreneur.<p>This is effectively the argument for the Durant School of Entrepreneurship; Business schools teach corporate management (generally speaking), not entrepreneurship. While many schools may offer entrepreneurship courses, they are often just thinly veiled management courses.<p>More on this can be found on Steve Blank's blog: <a href=""http://steveblank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com</a>",1290391447

Microsoft is a major investor in Facebook and thus far has been losing both search and mobile to Google.<p>With Facebook as the home page, Microsoft becomes the de facto search engine for millions of people because Bing is already integrated into Facebook.<p>Also, with more people communicating via Facebook mobile, Microsoft slowly but surely inches its way to winning the war on mobile through integration with Facebook on mobile devices.",1290391396

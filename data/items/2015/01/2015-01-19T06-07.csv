They won&#x27;t let you buy an additional seat for the dog, even in a carrier. 18lbs = under the plane. 2 hours early, dog fucking terrified, so you probably have to Benadryl the pup, and they&#x27;ve been known to freeze to death under there. Nope Nope Nope.<p>Have you considered getting a dog sitter, or pet hotel?",1421650761

8910683,comment,8908463,8909860,0,0,graycat,,,"Seymore Cray and Control Data were really something.
In the 1960s, Control Data was very much a hot stock.<p>Yes, later the Control Data SMDs (storage module
drives) were good units and quite popular in the
industry.<p>While I was working my wife and myself 
through our Ph.D. degrees, I was doing
applied math on some military systems analysis
work but also served as system administrator
for a Prime super-mini computer (basically
a version of Multics).  We started with
one of the 80 MB SMDs but later got
a 300 MB version.  Later as a B-school
prof, I proposed a Prime, and we got
one with two of the SMD drives.<p>There at the B-school, from my proposal,
at one point there was a shootout 
in front of my dean between me and 
the campus CIO:  
The CIO didn&#x27;t want us to get
our own computer and wanted
to claim that the SMD drives
needed <i>computer room</i> air conditioning.<p>I&#x27;d contacted Control Data to see if
we might buy the SMDs directly from
them, and they&#x27;d sent me their official
engineering specs which I happened to
bring to the shoot out.  There I
quoted the specs to show that 
simple <i>comfort</i> A/C would be fine
in both temperature control and
humidity control.  The CIO claimed
Control Data, Prime, and I were wrong.
I explained that while in grad
school we&#x27;d used no A/C at all
until summer when the room
got a little warm for people;
then we hung an A/C evaporator
unit off the ceiling with the
compressor and condenser 
unit on the roof;
the SMD drives were happy
all along.<p>The Prime lasted for 15 years,
well into when PCs were better.<p>The 300 MB SMD drives seemed
amazing.  The unit weighed 
some hundreds of pounds.
Now can get 3 TB or so
in a 3.5&quot; package -- amazing,
one of the most amazing
rates of improvement in all
of history.<p>The paper has some okay content.
It also has some flat statements 
about how VC works now:  No
technical risk.  Maybe some
market risk but not much.<p>My approach doesn&#x27;t fly:<p>(1) Pick a big problem, one where
the first good or much better solution
will, clearly, obviously, no doubt,
be a <i>must-have</i> for enough
people and earnings per person to
eliminate <i>market risk</i>,
achieve <i>product-market fit</i> right
away, and be financially successful.<p>The extreme case, but in biomedical,
would be a safe, effective, cheap
one pill cure taken once for any
cancer.<p>(2)
Then, for that problem, use technology
to get the needed first good or much better
solution.  There, for
<i>information technology</i>, get an
applied math solution where the
theorems and proofs can be checked.
This <i>solution</i> is evaluated just
on paper, that is, before any
software is written or, usually,
before spending any big bucks.<p>Then the rest of the project should be 
low risk and high payoff from
just routine work.<p>(1) and (2) have been, for 70+
years, very effective in
a huge range of astounding
projects for the US DoD
and, for much longer, 
much like how some of the best
applied math, applied science,
and engineering have been
done for 100+ years.<p>But for this approach, it is necessary
to be able to evaluate (1) and (2)
essentially just on paper, and
somehow VCs don&#x27;t want to do this.<p>So be it!  The flip side of that
situation can be an opportunity!",1421650572

8910675,comment,8909891,8910575,0,0,chroma,,,"Your line about nuclear proliferation is a total non-sequitur. The US of 1945 is not the US of today. Our ethics and standards have risen significantly in the past 65 years. You might as well call the US hypocritical for backing UN resolutions against racism because of segregation up to the 60&#x27;s.<p>> Along the lines of your argument, DPRK citizens shouldn&#x27;t be learning physics, chemistry, mathematics, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering and medical or any subject because they all can be used as &quot;weapon&quot; for nefarious purposes.<p>Except for medicine, probably yes. See my other comment for why I think that is the case.[1]<p>> Keeping the population of a country uneducated because you don&#x27;t agree with the government running the country is discriminatory and racist. No person irrespective of race or belief or country of citizenship should be denied education.<p>How is it racist? I have no ethical issues with South Koreans or North Korean defectors learning these things. I&#x27;m simply pointing out a concrete example of how, in some cases, education can be harmful on net. Simplifying it to, &quot;Education is good.&quot; won&#x27;t steer you wrong often. But when it does, the consequences can be horrific.<p>And to say one doesn&#x27;t agree with the DPRK is putting it far too mildly. Read <i>Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea</i>.[2] The stories will make you thankful to be in whatever country you live in. For many people, North Korea truly is hell on earth. It&#x27;s far worse than anything Orwell wrote about.<p>If the leaders of the DPRK could get away with it, they would rain fire on South Korea and the US tomorrow. The only thing stopping them is lack of ability. Educating their citizens helps them gain technology that will most likely be used to achieve the goals of the DPRK&#x27;s leaders. That will almost certainly lead to more harm than good.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8910491"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8910491</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North-ebook/dp/B002ZB26AO/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North-eboo...</a>",1421650424

Still, I think that a courteous owner goes a long way.<p>I don&#x27;t know if shepherds are specifically prone to barking but I can tell you that my dogs were particularly prone to barking when I found them. They pretty much barked at anything, other people, other dogs, just because they were bored, etc...

While it is an interesting setup (I&#x27;d love to know more about the image processing on board), this device would really not be very useful for sniping.<p>1) Laser range finder.  It will give away your position to anybody with a detector (yes, they exist and those who you would expect to have them do).  Also, unnecessary for actual sniping.  One of the first things you do when you setup a hide is do a range card - you can do that with a hand held laser range finder, but more often than not you just use simple algebra and known object sizes (height of telephone polls, car widths, width of men&#x27;s shoulders, etc).<p>2) Wind.  This thing only accounts for bullet drop.  A light breeze will push 5.56 far enough off target at 500 yards that you can easily miss man sized targets.  At 300 yards wind plays a role in shot placement within a man sized target, at 200 yards you can disregard most wind.  At that range you do not want a scope, as it delays target acquisition and reduces field of view.<p>3) Target marking.  It is very rare for a sniping target to remain stationary, so unless their image processing is really clever - this is going to be a much greater hindrance than help.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem for hunters, because they rarely take a shot at critters on the move (except with shotguns).  I&#x27;d be pretty surprised if their tracking software can handle vanishing targets (transitions in and out of concealment like a window or bush).<p>It is a great toy for hunters with money, but it isn&#x27;t going to turn anybody into a sniper.",1421649380

You <i>can</i> negotiate to higher levels of compensation, but there is more to life (and your job) than money.  I have often seen people price themselves out of a job.<p>A normal high tech company runs an R&D budget that is less than 10% of earnings.  The rest of the money goes to cost of sales, infrastructure (building, chairs, etc) and various other things.  This means that on average your contribution needs to pull in at least 10x your cost in order for you to be seen as being worth it.  There are also a lot of costs for hiring employees -- employee tax, insurance, benefits, etc, etc.  So if you make $100K in salary, then your contribution has to bring in maybe $1.2 - $1.5 million.<p>You may <i>think</i> &quot;Oh those bastard sales people are making way too much and aren&#x27;t providing any benefit&quot;, but you will find that the company will <i>still</i> budget less than 10% of earnings for R&D.  Whether it is justified or not, quite a few of the people in the &quot;management side&quot; identify a lot better with sales and understand their value a lot more.  Unless you think of a way to significantly increase earnings, then you are depleting the pool of cash for R&D when you ask for a raise.<p>&quot;Not my problem,&quot; you think.<p>Except Jane down the corridor appears to be very nearly as productive as you are (whether it is true or not is completely beside the point because everything will be judged by its appearances).  She makes something like 60% of what you make.  She&#x27;s a freaking bargain!  You, on the other hand, bitch and moan that you can&#x27;t make ends meet on $100K and that you are living out of garbage bins.  Plus you see yourself as the saviour of the company and without you everything will just collapse.  Managers think, &quot;God, please don&#x27;t make me talk to that guy again&quot;.<p>The order comes down from above -- either 1) Our competitors are kicking our ass and we need to downsize R&D  OR  2) We need to ramp up explosively to hit the next big business wave, so we need more programmers!<p>How will we reduce our expenditures or hire more programmers with the same amount of money?  Easy!  We&#x27;ll do away with those bitchy-moany prima donnas and hire more of the absolute bargains that never complain.<p>Here&#x27;s a secret I&#x27;ve learned.  Being seen as worth significantly more than you are paid means your boss always approaches you with a sense of gratitude.  In fact, creating a sense of solidarity with management in this respect shows loyalty.  While it is true that, in general, companies do not return such loyalty, individuals in management <i>will</i> tend to select a handful of people that they trust and &quot;can not do without&quot;.  Those people will <i>not</i> be the guys that constantly threaten to leave for greener pastures, or that constant complain that they aren&#x27;t appreciated.<p>I have never negotiated salary.

I have left jobs that I didn&#x27;t like, but I have never left to make more money.  Nor have I ever threatened to do so.

However, these rights are routinely infringed right now, so if you want to stand for them, please stand for them without exceptions. I.e. if the owner is the sole authority in determining who gets into their property, they can refuse anybody for any reason whatsoever, and no regulation or policy can stand in the way, that should be the case and all regulation concerning any such limitations should be removed. That&#x27;s fine, consistent approach which has my full sympathy.<p>On the other hand, if you allow exceptions, such as different handling of &quot;public places&quot;, even privately owned, if you accept regulation that limits the exclusive authority of the owner to exclude anybody they wish for any reason, then you have to be consistent and have some rules that would guide such regulation, and then what would be your reason to exclude people with (well-behaved) animals accompanying them, not infringing on anybody? &quot;I don&#x27;t like them, and that&#x27;s enough&quot; wouldn&#x27;t cut it anymore - not unless you agree to go all the way. I would prefer the former approach, but it&#x27;s not the world we live in now, so either we strive for that world, or we go with one we have now, but we can&#x27;t do both at once.<p>Also, regardless of that, I think it is important for people to be a bit more accommodating to each other even if nobody forces you to. Let&#x27;s assume you have full right to kick out every person with a dog out of your place of business. Why should you? Do they make any trouble? Every one of them, always? If not, why would you assume they are troublesome before any sign of trouble appears? Why not instead show some kindness and politeness and give people and dogs a chance to be good? If they don&#x27;t, you can always kick them out later (ok, on the plane you can&#x27;t but that&#x27;s rather exceptional situation, in most situations resolution is very easy).",1421647875

Different breeds have different behavior patterns and some specific to barking, some breeds are just more noisy than others no matter how you trained them. For example, terriers were used to rats, rabbits, and foxes [0]. This means they had to work along underground so that barking was actually a good trait otherwise their owners might not be able to find them when they had some dangerous situation underneath. Barking was an old GPS for their owners. Terriers were specifically selected by breeders to bark loud and frequent[1]. Of course that does not necessary mean a barking terrier is acceptable.

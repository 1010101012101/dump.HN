485562,comment,485498,485498,0,0,smikhanov,,,"I think the problem with this book is not about recipes it gives, and way how it approaches the problem, but the problem itself. I spent 8 years working in different software companies, and never met a person with the 'architect' job title, whose job would be different from one of either developer or manager.<p>Therefore, I personally do not believe in 'software architects'. And this book supports me in this! I went carefully through the list, diving inside some specific topics and it seems that all of them (or overwhelming majority) lie in the field of responsibility of someone who could be described by job title other than architect. ""#12 There is no one-size-fits-all solution"" -- fine, development issue. ""#17 Business Drives"" -- fine, management issue. And the the brightest gem of all: ""#80 Dont Be a Problem Solver"".",1234950388

485546,comment,485517,485517,0,0,aneesh,,,"While this seems like shady tactics from Mahalo, it also seems to suggest the need for a better (read: less game-able) ranking system than PageRank.  There's now tons more data about which sites users visit for a given query, whether they return to the results page, how much time they spend on a site, etc.  If you can sift through the noise, it seems like this would be an even more accurate indicator of site quality than hyperlinks to a page.",1234948292

It doesn't seem likely that it will be reduced to calculations, or simple formula manipulations such as can be performed by Mathematica.<p>And in case you think that B-T is irrelevant, informal reasoning about infinities produced all sorts of results that caused people problems.  Formal reasoning about infinities gave us calculus for real, that works wherever it's known to work.  And I use infinities on a daily basis designing and implementing systems to assist with tasks similar to air traffic control and automated target tracking.<p>Computers can be used to explore and experiment with numbers, geometry and some structures, and will probably one day be able to assist with exploring more abstract concepts, but as things stand today, there's a great deal of mathematics that no one can see how to do with computers.<p>To say otherwise is to demonstrate ignorance of both fields.",1234947649

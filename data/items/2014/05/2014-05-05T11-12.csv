It&#x27;s not just contained to math and science but even the arts and philosophy.<p>It&#x27;s a part of the prevailing attitude &quot;Everyone should go to college.&quot;  High schools focus on rote learning instead of critical thinking to improve their chances of admission to a good college.  Then those same colleges frown on those mechanical methods.  The worst part is we&#x27;re training people to be spoonfed knowledge rather then seek it.",1399291184

You will have access to the best developers out there, on demand, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about selecting the best candidate.<p>Since there is a payment involved, we expect no spamming and people will be asking questions when they really need it. On the other hand, since they pay, they can expect a quick and quality answer.

You don&#x27;t need any other Rackspace services, but there is a 10 mailbox minimum. There are two options: exchange and rackspace.

The exchange one is more expensive ($10/mo) but is a full exchange backend for your end users who need outlook. Both services are pay on demand, no contract. The other added bonus: Rackspace will take all the &quot;I can&#x27;t send email&quot; calls for you. I routinely tell my end users to just call Rackspace for email issues instead of me.

There are a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable to a smart young person... Spending a few years at a company that fails has path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company means you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people.<p>I actually find it opposite. First of all, it is not so easy to identify a company on a breakout trajectory. The line between a breakout success and failure is just too thin on an early-stage startups. Even if the startup works on the same field as your expertise, you have been following that field for years, and you think the founders are brilliant, you can still get the judgement wrong a lot of the time.<p>I think a startup&#x27;s failure is not so bad for a young and ambitious employee. There are just as many lessons can be learnt from failure as from success. As for path consequences, the young kids got so many productive years left and one failure is not really destructive or harmful. And a great thing is, if a startup fails most likely it fails fast. For your next job, people won&#x27;t hire/reject you because the previous company you worked for failed, they hire/reject because you are brilliant or not. Likely the stuff you learnt in the failed startup will make you a brilliant person (tech and non-tech wise).",1399290198

(The statements are generally more interesting if there is a correspondence with real life somewhere. But there doesn&#x27;t need to be one. Abstract nonsense and all that.)<p>That&#x27;s a fairly vague and and non-rigorous statement. Making it rigorous and specific could possibly involve mathematics, if desired.<p>So in this respect I see arithmetic is a bit like an instance (in the OO sense) of the act of mathematics, but mathematics is a class of thinking and, especially, expressing. In particular, the fact that most arithmetic has a fixed set of rules and you don&#x27;t generally invent new rules consistent with some meta-rules - the algorithm being performed could be trivially done by a computer - suggests to me that it doesn&#x27;t really require much mathematical thinking.<p>When I was younger (mid-teens, and aspiring programmer), adults used to ask me if mathematics was important for programming. I would reply that it is not, that it is very rare for complex arithmetic or calculus etc. to be useful in most programs. That statement was true for both how I and those I was talking to saw maths at the time. But now, looking back, I think programming does actually use some mathematical thinking - real mathematical thinking - albeit not requiring anything like the same level of rigour. You invent your symbols, and compose them to solve the problem, and try to ensure invariants are preserved, and convince yourself that all cases are handled and the result won&#x27;t have holes in the proof - i.e. bugs.",1399289886

So then the question is &#x27;why is your site so *%^%% slow then!!!&#x27; - what is it doing!!!<p>Put strace on there (I think you can do a local wget from the server and hook it to that, so no need for any setup) and sure enough it will tell you what it is doing. Sure the output is verbose, but there are command line switches for that. If that verbose output shows it is looking up some db value 10000 times just to show a web page then you can see that someone hasn&#x27;t written the code too well. This might not be easy to spot in the code, even if it is the neatest code you ever saw, however, nothing is hidden in strace.<p>Because disk operations and db read/writes are time expensive they stick out like a sore thumb in the strace log. Normally you need to run strace a few times to see whether caching is working as it should or if these lengthy calls will need some code refactoring.<p>All considered though, I have only used strace when things have got very desperate. Factors that have contributed to the emergency include developers that do not have any interest whatsoever in performance, lame hosting environments bought by people that have no understanding of the requirements and insufficient &#x27;rush job&#x27; testing where there is no testing, just some deadline. strace succeeds where &#x27;the proper way&#x27; hasn&#x27;t been setup yet or just isn&#x27;t useful.",1399289548

I also know the orthodox view that running your own server takes too much time, forever needs updates and such like.<p>However, I recently did build an email server and it works a treat. The enormous complexity and the lack of a decent guide was a problem, plus there is a lot to know. Fortunately I did know a bit about PTR/SPF/DKIM and so on and so forth, but I don&#x27;t think things like Postfix (even if you use them) are fathomable. For me the trick was to get it to work, as in send/receive mail, then to work on making sure the delivery works without stuff going down some black hole.<p>I have not bothered with a webmail frontend, e.g. Roundcube (which has been updated) as, in my experience, webmail frontends can get character sets mangled etc. I am using the normal email on my phone plus normal &#x27;Thunderbird&#x27;.<p>I have not had some sea of spam or hackers wanting to do nasty things. Now it just works and my build can survive a few apt-get type upgrades, reboots and resource problems (the kernel hasn&#x27;t killed the mail server things).<p>I built my mail server because I wanted to read email with code and that is kind of dependent on having your own email server if you are doing lots of developer things and you don&#x27;t want to be mysteriously barred from some service you have no control over.<p>There are no limits on what I can do with my own box, if I want emails from domains x + y to go to one particular box, or accounts Alice and Bob to go through to Cheryl&#x27;s account then I could do that with some extensive manual reading and a huge amount of time lost getting it to work. I would probably lose that time anyway doing it the Microsoft Way, but, at least I won&#x27;t hit a wall of impossibility.<p>As mentioned I have changed from &#x27;don&#x27;t roll your own&#x27; because it is allegedly about as silly as reinventing the wheel, to seeing &#x27;roll your own&#x27; as important to do and not as hard as people imagine. Clearly things might be different if I had fifty or so people wanting calendars and what not, I would go for a hosted, paid for thing under those circumstances out of cowardliness and not wanting to be blamed when it went wrong.<p>I must say that email is surprisingly hard once you get to the nuts and bolts of it.

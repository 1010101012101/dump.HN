Millions of people are in regular contact with that sort of ""stern + concerned"" thing in the form of the TSA, but other agencies are no less Kafkaesque (more so in fact given that they are operating in comparative darkness).<p>You can stand on a street corner and call yourself a programmer willing to work for $5.

Taking a look at the alternatives from just 5 years ago, the iPhone looks pretty damn open. And there is a reason for that, and why consumers didn't care.<p>Consumers are used to phones being locked, but consumers are also used to doing whatever they want with the computers they've bought. And funny thing - this wasn't always the case. IBM-compatible PCs that you could extend with ISA cards, assemble your own, coming bundled with MS-DOS / Windows - weren't the first PCs available. Even Apple came after Atari. And those home computers back in those day were pretty locked.<p>What changed the scene is the simple fact that software is so much bigger and more profitable than hardware; and there are many forces in the market that want hardware to be an unlocked and cheap complementary to software. You can see that playing right now with the battle between Android / WinMo 7 / iOS / Blackberry.<p>That's the biggest reason why Microsoft won in the 90's - not only over Apple, but also over IBM's OS/2 - they made no discrimination when it came to hardware, they ensured backwards-compatibility for third-party software at all costs, they kept the SDK free of charge. Compared to IBM's OS/2 ; Windows was a piece of shit ... but it ran fine on 286 processors and was compatible with everything you wanted.<p>My phone has at least ten times the horsepower of my first computer. I had no expectations out of my Nokia 3310; as I only expected it to make phone calls.<p>Bottom line - computing doesn't move beyond the PC, but towards the PC.<p>And Apple is increasingly becoming aggressive because they'd like to keep the grip they have right now, but they also realize that they cannot do it. Want to bet that they'll lose costumers to Android if for example Kindle for iOS is shut down?",1299224603

We allow people to set their own risk dial, whether that be a motorbike or a Volvo.<p>Indeed, the whole point of sites like Metacritic or Amazon's review section is that any particular review could be in error, but the sum total provides signal. Not perfect, but provably better than selecting a few people at random and keeping the product from the market unless they all agree.<p>And this extends to medical procedures too. Of course I will research hospitals before having that kidney transplant. Cedars Sinai has a good reputation; I don't need 13 years of medicine to know that it's good, anymore than I need to know how to direct a film to appreciate a movie. Because there are many other sources of reputation checks other than government: search engines, your friends, books, newspapers, etc. Good word of mouth about a device or doctor usually reflects technical merit, and when it does not, it is unlikely that a single bureaucrat will uncover that which has fooled the world. Bureaucrats go with public opinion, they do not buck it.<p>Moreover, every other area of life, we accept that products will suit some and not others. There is no accounting for taste, as the saying goes.<p>Medicines and treatments show just as much interpersonal variation as nutrients; indeed, many of them are simply refined nutrients. Yet we expect a centralized system to account for something inherently individualized. Little known fact: many arthritics wept when Vioxx was taken off the market, because <i>it worked for them</i>.<p>Why not let these people have their choice? Cancer patients cannot opt out of the FDA to take experimental drugs (the FDA actually sued to keep it this way!). And sometimes the crazies are actually right and the government is way wrong, like low fat vs. low carb.<p>The bottom line is that centralization of assessment in a fast-moving, technical area is going to be provably worse than peer review. Make the FDA opt-in rather than mandqtory and let the decentralized network of doctors be the ultimate judge. That's how Europe does it.",1299224345

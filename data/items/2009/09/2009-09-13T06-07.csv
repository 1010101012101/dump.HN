Assuming I start seriously dating at 18, and want to get married before 28, I've got 20 potential mates to evaluate.<p>So, the 'algorithm' is that I should date as many as I can (each for just enough time to be able to order them ) till I am ~22 (1/e*20/2 ~ 3.7 years), and then between 22-28 only date women long enough to compare her to all the women I dated from 18-22. If she is better, I should marry her. Otherwise, move on ASAP.<p>Of course, I've already 'failed' miserably at that plan (e.g., a 3 year relationship from 19-22), but that's what the math says you should do ;-)",1252824896

819902,comment,819732,819732,0,0,chasingsparks,,,"Thought experiment:<p>You find an algorithm that is very reliable for forecasting the near-term prices of an asset. Your algorithm only works in contemporary, or at least recent, markets. You notice that by building a basket of many assets, you can increase your leverage as you have a reduced the volatility of returns. You DO UNDERSTAND that there is a possibility of major failure, but you assign it a low probability and decide to let it ride for the time being. After all, after a certain level of profit, you can scale back the risk. The profits are too good, so you never scale back. Thus, you are the one standing when the music stops.<p>The end.",1252824692
819901,comment,819865,819865,0,0,desu,,,"Seems to mainly be about Reddit.<p>Didn't seem to answer the #1 question I had in my mind - how do they cache votes for logged-in users? Do they, say, cache a generic front page and then apply the user's prior voting choice via JS? Or do they cache the page only for the general public, and for logged-in users just cache their voting history and generate it on-the-fly?<p>However they do it, they do a damn good job. I'm always impressed by how responsive Reddit is, along with the other highly dynamic / high load sites like Digg, etc. They manage to stay up and running fine even with all that going on; but just a link on their front page to someone's blog, which should be almost static, crushes that server into goo. Shows the power of good design!",1252824653

819894,comment,819732,819784,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Oh you've got me started...<p>A whole of array individuals and idea-systems bare blame for the bubble. From the Quants' model to Alan Greenspan's ideology to the to mark-to-market-accounting to the repeal of Glass-Steagal and onward, they justified what was effectively the largest bubble in history. And given its size, the blame can go many places...<p>Moreover, you're acting like the crisis was just the bankruptcy of a few companies - the ones conveniently without Quants. The crisis has, in fact, hit the entire economy. And moreover, all of Wall Street was effectively bankrupt at the point when Lehman failed. The Fed just chose to throw some trading houses to the wolves and bailed out the rest. If the bailed-out houses thought like you, I wish they'd let them go too.<p>And further, you are not in the least addressing the points in this and other articles, the problems with Black-scholes, the Gaussian Copula and so-forth.",1252823485

That should be left to the person interviewing and hiring you.<p>To be hired you have to be able to stand out of the croud while fitting into what is required.  HR is there to make sure the latter is true and once that is met see if you have shown enough to move up to the next level.",1252823447

If, say, a significant number of those kids were taken by strangers in cars who lured them over verbally, simply informing parents to push the ""Don't talk to strangers"" bit might alone prevent some future occurrences. Just because the number is small relative to the overall population size doesn't mean that there isn't some correlation between many of the incidents, on which some acceptable measures could be taken.",1252823114

The trade-off, of course, is that it has no idea how well _you_ have memorized various things (i.e., being prerecorded audio, it is generalized).",1252823100

The 'accountability' referred to in the post is about users of the API - they shouldn't be expected to be aware of server state/side effects, in the same way that users of a function call shouldn't be expected to be aware of its implementation/side effects.

3036288,comment,3035954,3035954,4,0,wandernotlost,,,"Let's stop for a moment and consider how the web actually works.  Your browser sends an HTTP GET request for a page.  The response for this page contains HTML and JavaScript. The browser then executes the JavaScript, often making other requests (GET and/or POST) in order to do its work.  In the case of most Facebook operations (I haven't looked at this one specifically), JavaScript executed by your browser makes these requests on your behalf to communicate with and display information from Facebook.  Google Analytics works this way too, making additional requests to a different server from the page you directly requested.<p>Unless the website in question has a back channel directly to Facebook, through which it communicates information about the GET requests you've made, the initial GET request has nothing to do with the data sent to Facebook.  Furthermore, because of browser security limitations, this back-channel approach is not always even possible, since the original site does not typically know your Facebook ID (this may not be true for some sites with which Facebook has special partnerships, e.g. Yelp and TripAdvisor).  Only requests made to facebook.com would have the cookie information that identifies you.<p>In summary, the HTTP GET request you make to fetch a web page has nothing to do with the information sent to Facebook, and HTTP's recommendations about GET requests have nothing at all to do with these other requests.<p>Also, people have been senselessly abusing HTTP for years.",1316973413

For the first time I was writing large code and doing serious graphics work, and I loved it deeply.<p>It lead me towards building websites and writing about games, and out of the Quake community I met people who ran Unreal websites - they gave me a copy of their CMS, and I ended up learning PHP/MySQL from it and building and designing bigger and better websites.<p>I dropped out of my Mechatronics/CS degree to pursue programming for a living - which lead to my first exposure to the then-revolting idea that programming and design were different disciplines. I spent years bouncing back and forth between the two, never quite fitting in, but learning a ridiculous amount along the way.<p>Now I'm at Google, technically employed as a software engineer but leading the design of a large product.

Now that is a lot of storage; actually more storage than most people really need. So what can we do with all that extra storage you may be wondering? What if I told you that we could use all this extra storage to act as an online hard drive for you to store files?<p>Thanks to a great program by the folks over at http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm you can create a virtual drive in Windows Explorer or under My Computer that allows you to store files directly into your Gmail account. When you install this program, it will create a shell extension that links directly to your Gmail account. To use it you just have to open the Gmail Drive under My Computer or Windows Explorer, enter your logon credentials, and start dragging files into and out of the Gmail Drive. Simple as that. There are, though, some limitations to this program. As of right now, you are limited to uploading only files 10MB or smaller using the Gmail Drive extension. If this is a problem for you, you may want to check our our listing of other gmail storage programs.<p>Now lets get started!<p>Preparing the Gmail account for storage use.<p>When you store files using Gmail Drive, Gmail will place these files into your Inbox folder. If you start storing a lot of files, this can quickly clutter up this folder. To make it more organized we will create a rule that puts all your stored files into the Gmail Archive instead, which will keep the Inbox clutter free. All files uploaded using the GMail Drive have a subject that contains the text GMAILFS. Using this text we will create a filter that automatically places any messages with that subject into the Archive.<p>Logon to Gmail. \nClick on the Create a filter link which is next to the Search the Web button at the top of the Gmail screen. \nIn the Create a Filter dialog, enter GMAILFS into the Subject: field. Then press the Next Step button. \nPut a checkmark in the Skip the Inbox (Archive it) checkbox and then press the Create Filter button.\nNow when you upload a file using Gmail Drive, it will automatically bypass your Inbox and be stored in the Archive. To view the files in the Archive, simply click on the All Mail link in the left hand navigation menu.<p>Installing the GMail Drive shell extension<p>The first step is to download the software using the links found at the bottom of this page:<p>http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm<p>Once downloaded, simply extract the files and double-click on the Setup.exe program. When it has completed it will open a help file that you should read to get an understanding of how the program works. When done reading, simply open My Computer (or Windows Explorer) and you should see the Gmail Drive as shown in Figure 1 below.<p>Figure 1. My Computer with the Gmail Drive<p>Using the Gmail Drive to store files<p>Now that the software is installed, simply start copying files into the Gmail Drive. You can also right-click on files and select Send To -> Gmail Drive. When you start upload a file the extension will present a progress meter as shown in Figure 2 below.<p>Figure 1. Upload a file to the Gmail Drive<p>When the file has completed uploading, the extension will enumerate the folder again and you will be able to see the files stored in the folder. If you want to delete a file, simply click on the file once to select it, and then press the delete key. Below is a figure of my Gmail Drive that I have been playing around with.<p>Figure 1. Files stored on a Gmail Drive<p>As you can see you can store a variety of file types and sizes and as long as you have the Gmail Drive extension installed a computer, you can access these files from anywhere.\nOther Programs for using Gmail as online storage<p>Though I personally like Gmail Drive due to its ability to create a virtual drive for you, it does have a major limitation. The ability to only store files that are 10 MB or smaller. If this is not that big of a deal for you, and you like having the virtual drive, then there is no reason to read further. On the other hand, if not having the virtual drive is fine with you but you need to store files greater than 10 MB then you may want to look at the programs described below.<p>RoamDrive<p>The first program that we will talk about is RoamDrive. RoamDrive is an application that provides an interface allowing you to upload and download files to your Gmail account. It also has the nice feature of allowing you to specify a total of amount of space that you want to utilize for storage so that you do not use all your space for email. This program is able to get past the 10 MB file size limit by breaking up larger files into multiple pieces. If you would like to make a filter for files stored with RoamDrive as discussed in the preparation section above, you should use the text ROAMDRIVE in your subject filter.<p>Gspace<p>If you are a FireFox person, and like to do everything there, then there is an extension called Gspace that allows you to upload files to your Gmail account. It works the same way as RoamDrive in that it overcomes the 10 MB limit by breaking files into multiple pieces. If you would like to make a filter for files stored with RoamDrive as discussed in the preparation section above, you should use the text GSPACE in your subject filter.\nConclusion<p>Now that we have concluded this tutorial I need to mention that these program's functionality are dependent on Gmail. If they make any changes to their system there is a chance that these application will be broken. If this happens, just wait until an update is released to work with the new version of Gmail. Regardless, your files will still be accessible through Gmail itself.<p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to let us know know in our forums.",1316972847

3036244,comment,3035820,3035820,9,0,ambiate,,,"The quake community and game changed my life.  Of course, when I started, it was mplayer.  I had just traded my Playstation 1 for a 486DX, a huge mistake in everyone's eyes.  I used my rich friend's grandmother's AOL login to get online.  (This continued for 3-4 years, my mother still wonders what the ""weird noise"" was on the phone lines past midnight).<p>The broken physics and quirks of Team Fortress in QuakeWorld is what really caught my eye.  I was hooked like a fiend.  I was recruited by many guilds and known for my 9600BP lagging , teleporting and fragging!  Not to mention my 1MB cirrus logic integrated video card, it chugged along at ~12FPS in 320x200(?).<p>I got interested in manipulating Quake.  Living in MS, there were no mentors for learning to program or script.  I went in blind and came out with a few mods.<p>Years later, I ported team fortress with quakeworld physics into Enemy Territory, (Feb/Mar 2004?), but never found anyone interested in doing the sound or graphics.<p>Obviously, my original endeavor into quakeC led to a whole new world of coding and languages!<p>At this point, I had a few life changes.  I made a handful of lifetime friends from IRC and my old clans.<p>Now, looking back, it was Quake and my natural ability to tinker that led to my pursuit of a degree in computer science/bioinformatics.  I am currently in my junior year.<p>I emailed John Carmack a few times asking for legal advice regarding using shareware Quake 1 models in a development version of my port of QuakeWorld to ET.  He gave me good advice and has been a great influence.<p>Oh, and trying to figure out how to make VIS run faster on a BSP map was the end of me.  VIS took forever, and I mean forever, to run on my 100mhz computer.",1316972398

3036232,comment,3035934,3035934,1,0,kposehn,,,"I worked on a side business for about a year, right after I got married. At the end of that time, when the founder of the company I worked at and I had some irreconcilable differences, we parted ways and I worked on my side business full time.<p>That was 3 1/2 years ago and now I own two companies; the first one I started which is a quite successful marketing business and the second which is a mobile/social app startup that just graduated from an incubator here in SD and is raising a round of capital.<p>What I ended up doing to stay sane was relatively simple:<p>1. I set effective boundaries with my day job. I wasn't paid to work extra hours or do stuff above and beyond my job. I did what I could but made sure that I also stuck to my guns when I wasn't willing - or was unable - to do something. With this I could focus when I got home and not feel completely drained (most days).<p>2. I planned out my side work-time and stuck to it. Instead of just working every available second, I did my best to plan out when I worked on it and when I didn't. By sticking to these rules, I avoided largely burn-out and was able to move forward at a steady pace. However, when you are on something hot, be ready to give that extra push if it will pay off; you'll know when it happens :)<p>3. I didn't forget my home life. My wife and I had just married and were both working our asses off. We did our best to get time out and be together, whether that meant playing video games or going to the park. One of the perks of my job was that I could take a bit of time off if needed (Friday off meant working a bit longer during the week) which made things easier.<p>4. I didn't quit my day job prematurely. When I ended up leaving the job, it was too early, but I didn't give in to the temptation to leave far too early when it would probably have sunk us. Be patient and methodical with your side business until you are pretty damn sure you're ready. If you just hop off willy-nilly, you can be sure things can go south quickly.<p>This was my experience with it, and I'm thankful every day I did it this way. Everyone has a different experience and different priorities, but hopefully this can help you too.",1316972081

And I can understand that for them having to remember several logins and unconnected accounts (one for photo sharing, another for email, yet others for IM, blog etc.) is a lot less attractive than one site that lets them do all of the above (albeit with much less control and privacy, neither of these cause them to lose any sleep).<p>As for me, since most of my non-tech friends are on facebook anyway I have to keep my presence there to keep in touch. I have to admit, facebook is a pretty effective way of keeping in touch. I know I can call/email or meet in person - which I do for my inner circle of close friends. But the fact of the matter is a lot of my friends live abroad and international calls are expensive. Also, we seldom feel the need to make a call or send an email unless there is something specific we want to talk about (but that could be just me). OTOH, placing a small comment on Facebook seems a lot more effortless. The other party can also not feel compelled to answer. And there are a lot of friends I have on facebook who I don't want to lose contact with but don't want to have a day to day relationship with either (i.e. saying hi or meeting up once in a while - but not hanging out every weekend or constantly IM-ing every day).<p>Another thing is, apart from facebook chat, all interactions on facebook are semi-live at best. I can post a comment and the reply does not have to instant. This is good, especially if the other party lives in a very different time zone.<p>I am also on G+, but unfortunately most of my non-tech friends find it rather confusing, empty or just ignore it altogether.

3036167,comment,3035549,3035841,1,0,eddieplan9,,,"I have used Backbone to build a rich UI app, which would be way beyond my capability and patience level if it was not for the design decision to strictly adhere to MVC. The app is about presenting scientific data in multiple forms, and allowing user to interact with the data and see the outcome of an action instantly. Think Excel with data-driven charts and lots of them. Adhering to MVC allows me to wire models and views up once properly and then forget about the views to focus on the data. It also makes it easy to add after-thought  extra views easily without the need to find places to add the wires. Sorry the app is for internal use so I cannot post a link to it. The take-home message for me was that MVC is about separation of concerns to reduce complexity. It becomes an obvious choice when an application is complicated by tangled lines of dependencies across components.",1316970634

3036153,comment,3035549,3035761,3,0,gruseom,,,"I was hoping someone would point this out. I tried many times to understand what MVC meant and came to the conclusion it was ill-defined. The M and V are easy to understand: separation of presentation from content. That is what your teacher was teaching. But the definitions of what C is and how it interacts with M and V are so vague and varied that I eventually threw the whole concept out.  (Note that there's no C in your teacher's example. Both command-line and GUI programs have control responsibilities. Actually, both have views too. Yet the distinction is still instructive.)<p>I believe we should focus on first principles on the one hand (in this case, separation of concerns) and specific problems on the other. Trying to formalize first principles into proto-programs has proven to be a mistake. You end up with ersatz abstractions that don't stand up to interrogation - things that take the form of something precise, but aren't precise. That is confusing, leads to a great deal of useless secondary thinking like ""is my program <i>really</i> MVC"", and inevitably bogs down in semantic disputes. The more one focuses on such stuff, the less one focuses on real software. It makes you worse at building systems, not better.<p>First principles are imprecise, but simple and profound. They guide you very well if you let them. Specific designs are precise, but always relative to the specific problem they're trying to solve. Both these levels of abstraction make sense; it's the in-between layer that leads to confusion and should be eschewed.  But it's perennially seductive to people who are attracted by the thought of figuring software out at a meta (but still technical) level.<p>Edit: skimming through the comments in this thread shows how differently, and how incompatibly, people interpret these terms. They exist to provide ""a common vocabulary so people can know what they're talking about"" (the standard rationale for patternspeak), but the facts on the ground are Babelian.",1316970336

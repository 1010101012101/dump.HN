Faculty salary increases are mainly going to the prominent STEM faculty, who typically make >$100k (sometimes >$150k recently), because otherwise you are not going to retain them in the face of competition from other universities and the private sector. So I guess the board should be happy about his departure, no? A decrease in payroll! Certainly some $65k philosophers who haven't gotten a raise since 2003 isn't where all the extra money is going.",1340157595

EFF probably has to consider things like: does a given idea has a chance of being implemented by congress.<p>EFF is fighting the good fight. They try to improve the awful patent system and I have no doubt they do it in the best way they can.<p>Nothing stops the guy who created this petition to evangelize abolition of software patents. He can even start his own foundation for defending internet and civil liberties.<p>But attacking EFF in this way is harmful. He brings nothing positive to the table and can only derail EFF's efforts by instigating infighting among people who want the same thing: fix broken patent system.<p>Finally, one can support EFF's reform as well as patent abolition. We would be better off with either one.<p>Just don't attack EFF for trying to do something about patents.",1340157309

4135252,comment,4135178,4135178,1,0,tikhonj,,,"It's not quite the same. For other patents, your invention needs to be some device or method for doing something. Now, this invention was obviously designed with math, but only the end result is patentable. That is, if you design some novel tire (for example), only the itself is protected--the math used to get the design in the first place is <i>not</i> protected. If somebody used the same math to come up with a different sort of tire, they would not have to license your patent.<p>With software patents, there is <i>no</i> device or method. You're taking some math and patenting it just because it's being used on a general computing device. The program itself is not what's protected by the patent--it's the actual math the program is isomorphic to that's protected. Somebody could write a completely new program using the same mathematical foundations and it <i>would</i> infringe on the software patent.<p>So yes, most patents are going to boil down to math one way or the other. The difference is that software patents protect the math <i>directly</i> where other patents only protect some specific device or invention.",1340157069

Here it is so that my answer makes sense (I don't believe in deleting my own posts)<p>>Serious question, since I see this said a lot, but isn't that true of anything other than process patents? I'm hard-pressed to think of a patent in any other engineering discipline that at the end of the day doesn't boil down to math.<p>Here's how I look at it: If someone come up with a better car engine, they can patent it because it's a design and application of math.  It's not like they patented the Carnot Cycle and precluded ANYONE from ever building ANY internal combustion engine.  It's a specific design, not a general formula.<p>Patenting an algorithm, which is a purely mathematical construct, precludes any work done in the field.  Patenting the design an ASIC that implements the algorithm would be the closest example I can think of to patenting an engine based on the Carnot cycle (and I'd be fine with a patent on your ASIC design).",1340157062

4135198,comment,4130949,4135045,1,0,skore,,,"> Every single pollution tops radioactive waste since radioactive waste sits in a storage cask<p>Of course, preferably, every type of pollution should sit in a storage cask. I was under the impression that we were discussing the <i>potential of pollution</i> of different pollutants. If we compare storage casks, we get to actually compare how dangerous they are. In that comparison, radioactive waste should win the battle for what is most dangerous.<p>> So instead you want more fly ash? Picking ""don't make electricity"" is not an option.<p>Fly Ash is mostly produced by coal plants. Where did I say I support those? Capturing fly ash in other processes is comparatively simple when you do it right - although writing that may just spin into another discussion of why you think it's actually the other way round and it's radiation that is more easily contained and managed.<p>> Don't do anything with it, just leave it there. When technology improves, use it for fuel.<p>No, that's the point - it's not even ""there"", it's in <i>holding facilities</i> right now, because we still haven't decided what this ""there"" actually is.<p>Also - if you ask me to grant you that we will develop this improved technology - why is it different for alternative, renewable sources of energy?<p>> And I guess coal dust doesn't bother you? Or ozone leading to lung cancer? Or particulate matter (PM2.5)? It has to be radiation I guess.<p>Well, that's again putting words in my mouth. <i>Pollution</i> bothers me - there. Radioactive pollution bothers me <i>most</i>. That's all there is to it. I should be allowed to not be OK with multiple types of pollution, right?<p>> Not exactly. Renewable fuels are not actually renewable since you need to build the machine to get that energy, and that building material is not free. Nor is the land area free - I prefer to use land for other things, not cover the earth in energy harvesting machines.<p>Note that I wrote ""renewable source"", not ""renewable fuel"". Once you've built a wind turbine, it kind of keeps going (save for repairs along the way). You don't have to rebuild it at the rate that you have to go back to the mine to dig up more fuel. Which you have to do for energy from fossil fuels - for which you <i>also</i> have to build the facilities.<p>> Use all the energy in uranium and it'll last 20,000 years. Then we can start using thorium, and we have even more of that than we do uranium. By that time we can start mining asteroids.<p>Not sure how to respond to that other than that it sounds very old fashioned and boring and I'm still not convinced it will hold pace. Not to mention that it is in no way a justification, just an excuse to use the fuel. Renewable sources of energy are also just ""lying around"" ready to be ""mined"" by us. And they are, to me, universally <i>less concerning</i> in terms of environmental impact when compared to nuclear energy.<p>> Maybe I missed something but what technology are you talking about?<p>The article talks about 17% usage of renewable energy sources in Germany for 2010 - most of it in wind, followed by hydro and your dreaded solar at a distant third place. In any case - I would think that's substantial enough to render your original assertion moot.",1340155954

They do not reflect anything remotely like modern card capabilities, and their use directly causes harm to the ozone layer, kittens, and infants. I'm pretty sure that glBegin() gave a coworker cancer, and the matrix stack has claimed more lives than Kevorkian.<p>Building a shim to port over old OpenGL 1.3 apps is kind of like translating the Necronomicon into English--possible, of questionable utility, and likely to bring about insanity and demons.<p>As others have pointed out, OpenGL ES is not intended to be an extension of OpenGL--it was a chance to break out a lot of the dumb cruft that had accumulated into the API. Most of the features he's complaining about are either bad practice or should be gotten rid of entirely.<p>Compare the length of the API listings for GL 1.x, 2.x, and modern 3.x / 4.x. Remember that the whole thing is a hissing, clanking state machine, and that interactions between functions can be arcane--and threading presents additional issues.<p>Immediate mode rendering with glBegin()/glEnd()/glVertex()/glNormal/etc. is ugly. Any shim that collects that information still has non-trivial work stuffing it into a buffer, and the overhead of drawing anything with more than a few hundred triangles soon becomes absurd. Worse, this style of programming discourages storing geometry on the card, and that causes additional inefficiency--and trying to use those calls remotely over X causes all kinds of stupid as glx can barely do indirect rendering anyways.<p>Additionally, we have additional vertex stream attributes available now which are very flexible and don't map onto that anymore. It's time to let go.<p>~<p>tl,dr: jwz is complaining about a fork of an API that removed cruft people depended on, but the cruft needed removing. :(",1340154267
4135112,comment,4133686,4134954,8,0,_delirium,,,"I'd be interested in what proportion of that is spent on <i>education</i>, because sponsored research is sort of its own (problematic) can of worms. When sponsored program revenues are up by 60%, for example, that almost <i>requires</i> that expenditures go up by 60-80%, because those programs generally come with quite strict conditions on spending the money expeditiously, and often specify exactly how to spend it (this is particularly common with DARPA grants, which are extremely front-loaded and micromanaged). In addition, these grants often come with some co-funding requirement on the part of the university, both explicitly and in terms of ""upgrading facilities"", though some of that is then taken back again by the university in overhead charges.<p>UVa, like most research universities, has been quite aggressive in trying to ""encourage"" faculty to get more grants. If that's successful, overall spending must of course increase proportionately, because the grant requires the recipient to ramp up hiring of program personnel. If that's not a goal, then the university should de-prioritize or even discourage grants, because they mandate spending increases.<p>A different angle would be to look at breakdowns by department. Which departments have gotten more expensive? My guess is that, as this is likely tied to grant-funded research, it's mostly STEM departments, not the ""marginal"" humanities.",1340154261
4135111,comment,4130949,4134992,1,0,skore,,,"Nah, fear isn't really the issue here, I would say that I have a rather calculated understanding of why I find radioactive waste so problematic (and since you asked, you'll have to endulge the full explanation).<p>For me, it comes down to what kind of pollution we are talking about and radioactive pollution is particularly nasty to me as it represents a <i>chaotic</i> pollution that is just exceptionally hard to deal with.<p>Let's say the simplest, non-chaotic, kind of pollution is ""dirt on your shoe"" - you know where it came from (that thing you just stepped in), you know where it is (you see it on your shoe), what it does (hardly anything, except look bad) and how to get it out (wash it off).<p>With radioactive pollution, knowing where the pollution is coming from can already be a tough job - if you have a known leak, sure, that's where it's coming from. But often, you have to use a Geiger counter to detect it in the first place and often times, you then still have to figure out where the actual source is.<p>Where it <i>went</i> is mostly a statistical science, which is only comforting if your arm chair is not close to the accident in question. If it is, it's highly distressing.<p>Next up, it's still completely up for graps what it does - for humans, it can be anything from a challenged immune system to instant death, depending on the dose. (Although the latter is reserved for those rare occurances where you happen to hang out with the direct fallout of an exploding atom bomb, I believe.) Most of the time, in an accident, you only determine how bad it was after the fact. At minimum, it always carries a risk of mucking with your DNA or giving you a higher chance of cancer down the road (we have differed on how ""horrifying"" this prospect is, before).<p>How to get it out is where it gets even worse - most of the time, you scrap together everything that you determined to be affected in step two and put it in sealed containers, which isn't helpful if that thing is 'most of your own cells' (although the people around you will differ on that opinion). Your most likely prospect in terms of any kind of unusual exposure is to die slightly earlier and a lot shittier than you had anticipated.<p>In conclusion, I would say that it's more of a ""we simply don't fully understand what we unleash, so let's develop what we do understand"" concern. Not a ""omg, a castor drove through Italy, I'm gonna get cancer tomorrow"" fear.<p>> There is a pollution action day in my city right now because of people like you, and I'm not happy about it. I want them to shut down all hydrocarbon electric plants (save the hydrocarbons for cars), and switch everything to nuclear.<p>That almost made me LOL - Why is it ""because of people like [me]""?

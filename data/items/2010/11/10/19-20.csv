For one thing, this sort of idea was fairly common about the G4 processors, even though Apple was by far the smallest purchaser of G4 processors -- Ericsson, Cisco, and Nortel were shipping routers using G4's in tens of thousands while Apple was still taking pre-orders in some cases.<p>Another thing to consider is that Samsung is among the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing companies. They fabricate and sell enough semiconductor products to make even Intel's volume look comparatively small. Even with the iVolumes that Apple produces, it's hard to imagine that even they could be a dominant consumer by volume.",1289419096

You have a clear path to revenue, and you are addressing a common problem, which I can attest to as a hiring manager.<p>One suggestion to potentially extend your market: a multi tenant version. I have been pondering to accept third party job listings on a topical website I'm running, which would allow hiring managers within the industry to post their jobs. If you could make this an option within your offering, I'd jump on it. If you could also provide the billing etc, it would be awesome.<p>It's probably a considerable change to your site architecture, but this would be a nice way to get exposure (e.g. on high traffic blogs), and an additional source of revenue.<p>EDIT: I just checked how this is done on Techcrunch. They use personforce.com.<p>Additional thoughts:<p>- A little bit about the company would increase users trust. If you have a real address, put in a Google map image.<p>- Demo of the site and widget.<p>- Consider a name change (as pointed out in another comment)<p>- Congratulations, the fruits of your hard work look great!",1289419075

Morals set aside, the money was good and I had a wedding to pay for. A CAPTCHA system becomes quite breakable when it becomes predictable. The system in question used an image based CAPTCHA that used the same (albeit annoying) font for each image, as well as a static distortion overlay and a second set of random distortion. By extracting a thousand sample images I was able to build a system in Perl that could determine the text with an estimated 98% success rate - and when it failed you would just request a new CAPTCHA.<p>My solution would be to mix up images with logic.

Python can do this because the methods are stored in a dictionary which gets looked up by method name at runtime). This will never be as fast as a static function call in C or even an indirect vtable-based call (indirect pointer access vs hash table lookup).<p>That is a single reason why Python can never be compiled to run as fast as C.

Abusing your monopoly to force your way into a new market is, but simply using profits from one product line to fund R&D on a new product doesn't count.<p>Even if Apple has achieved a near-monopoly over digital music or sales or portable music, it's not at all clear that they have had the opportunity to abuse that monopoly. There have been cases (Psystar, etc.) that have tried to get the bundling of Mac OS X and Apple computers ruled as illegal tying, and they have failed. For the foreseeable future, there will not be grounds for a federal antitrust case against Apple.<p>You should try to conceive of Apple as the poster child for a successful business strategy: vertical integration. A large part of the success of Apple's expansion beyond computers is due to the fact that they can and have ensured that the products work well together, and that most of the products they have introduced have been natural complements of their existing products.<p>You also seem to be somewhat ignorant of the timeline of Apple's rise over the past decade. The iPod was on the market and gaining traction for a year and a half before the iTunes Music Store opened. At the time the iTunes Store opened, DRM was mandated by pretty much all the content owners. If this contributed to Apple getting a monopoly on digital music sales, the blame should fall on the music studios for not insisting that the online stores they deal with use a single interoperable DRM system, and not on Apple, who had no incentive to promoting interoperability with other music stores and players.<p>The profits of the iPod+iTunes Store combo provided most of the funding for the Intel switch and the development of the iPhone. Like the iPod, the iPhone was on the market and gaining traction for about a year and a half before the App Store opened. It's hard to argue that Apple's computers have been helped much by the iPod and iPhone other than by generally strengthening the Apple brand.<p>Each step of the way to their current position, Apple has done it by introducing products that can be at least moderately successful on their own, without the hardware/software tying you are complaining about. None of those individual steps has been anywhere as close to monopoly abuse as, say, Microsoft's entry in to the video game console market, which faced no significant legal challenges. Nor has Apple clearly erected any artificial barriers to entry for competitors. Their agreements with content producers are not exclusive, and now that DRM is not applied to music sales, there's no significant barrier to using music purchased through iTunes on other music players. To the extent that Apple has created any barriers to competition, it has only been by raising the standards for usability and quality.",1289417190

If so, I apologize, but I was away for a bit and I found your response interesting.<p>The reason I responded to your initial post is that it seemed to suggest you support Dawkins' ideas but not his methods. I was pointing out that his methods actually follow logically from his ideas. In your follow-up post, I realize that you weren't making an idea/method distinction -- you actually just disagree with him. So it turns out that this is really just a bog-standard debate about theism.<p>I was all fired up to post a response, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that a refutation would really just resemble a series of excerpts from Dawkins' book. In other words, I think he's already addressed your position quite convincingly. If you read it and didn't feel the same, I'm unlikely to do better.<p>But one last point. You've misattributed the ""boil down"" of the book. Dawkins is doing something like this:<p><pre><code>  1. Here's why it's illogical to be a fence-sitting agnostic\n  2. Here's why it's illogical to posit God as an explanatory philosophy of the universe\n  3. Here are some specific problems with common theist arguments\n  4. Okay, now that we've got all that out of the way, here are some interesting theories on how things got to be the way they are\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, the part of his book that you single out is the part that he attaches heavy disclaimers to. The fact that you chose to focus on it suggests to me that your belief that ""it's impossible to know for sure one way or the other,"" is even more of a gut-feeling assertion that you're accusing him of.<p>My personal context: I'm also an agnostic, but I am what Dawkins would describe as a Temporary Agnostic in Practice, whereas you seem to be what he would describe as a Permanent Agnostic in Principle. I disagree with Dawkins on many things, but I found his arguments against fence-sitting agnosticism to be persuasive.",1289415854

But since people started managing parts of their social graphs on Facebook instead of through (say) Gmail, Google's edge graph is starting to get stale.

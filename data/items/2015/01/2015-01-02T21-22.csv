I know of no newspaper or website that does formal fact-checking; the only times I recall being formally factchecked were when I&#x27;ve written for monthlies like Playboy, Wired magazine, etc. Here&#x27;s a famous example of where fact-checking would have been useful: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Glass#The_New_Republic_affair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Glass#The_New_Republic_...</a><p>At other news organizations there is, in theory, informal fact-checking. I&#x27;ve done that as an editor and reporter, and I&#x27;ve had that done to me by my editors and, more frequently, by the good folks working on copy desks. This is not necessarily a rigorous process, but it can flag more obvious problems, hyperlinks to the wrong web pages, information stated as fact that is no longer accurate, etc.<p>As <jonnathanson> points out nearby, some of these built-in safeguards have been eroded by the journalism crunch. Others have been removed by  the perceived need to increase publishing speed. I know of one news organization that had 3-4 humans involved in reviewing a story circa 2002 before it could be published on the web. By 2010-2012, however, reporters were clicking the &quot;publish&quot; button in the CMS themselves for almost all stories -- and then sending a request to the copy desk for an edit <i>after</i> the story was live.<p>[Disclosure: I worked as a technology journalist, albeit one with a technical background, before leaving CNET/CBS last year to found <a href=""http://recent.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recent.io/</a>]",1420235797

We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We’ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world’s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you’re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there’s no better place.
The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there’s a lot of room for growth.<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com.

Data/Bio Scientists, Hardware, Firmware and 
Software Engineers. Please note that this offer is mostly focused on 
Full Stack Engineers, but we are also looking to 
hire smart Data Scientists who have an interest in biodata and possibly 
people who could help bridging BLE/MSP firmware and driver development.<p><pre><code>    What we do
    ==========
</code></pre>
OMsignal is an exciting Montreal start-up developing a revolutionary 
line of bio-sensing clothes that connect seamlessly 
to smartphones. The company is at the intersection of the wearable 
technology, well-being and fashion markets.<p>We are a well-funded startup [1] working to deliver a smart biometric 
shirt. You can read more about our mission on [2]. 
And for those who followed the US Open 2014, we are the technology 
behind Ralph Laurent Polo Tech.<p>We just shipped the product to our first customers.<p><pre><code>    What we are looking for
    =======================
</code></pre>
We are looking for Full Stack Software Engineers who can 
help us to architect, design and implement a complex system based
on bleeding edge technologies (Scala, Akka, Spray, Reactive Programming [3], 
iOS, Swift, Docker...), a modern architectural 
style (Micro Services, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Eventual Consistency), 
and a clean codebase (Clean Code, Domain Driven Design…) -- emphasis on 
the “Engineer” over the “Full Stack” part.<p>In-depth knowledge of the technologies we use is not required, but 
having strong Software Engineering foundations is 
(Algorithmics, Design and Architectural Patterns,  …). 
Understanding that code is read much more often than it is
written is an absolute must.<p>You should be willing to face the upcoming challenges 
(Machine Learning, Predictive algorithms, 
Opening the platform/iOS SDK/API, -- who knows the rest?…).<p>And of course, you need to speak/write english fluently 
(we need to understand each other, right ?)<p><pre><code>     The Technologies we currently use
     =================================

 - Backend : Scala, Akka, Akka Persistence, Spray, ReactiveMongo, SBT, Kafka, ZooKeeper
 - Web : NodeJS, AngularJS
 - iOS : Swift, Objective C, ReactiveCocoa, Core Bluetooth, CocoaPods`
 - DevOps : Ubuntu, Docker, Ruby, Amazon AWS/EC2
 - Project management: git/github
 </code></pre>
The `iOS` stack is more sophisticated than the average iOS App. 
It includes a Pub/Sub system similar 
to `Apache Kafka` (that we call iOS Kafka internally), 
makes heavy use of 
asynchronous programming + `CQRS`/`Event Sourcing` and 
computes biometric algorithms and reports.<p><pre><code>    Our culture
    ===========
</code></pre>
We get some inspiration from the Open Source model to 
achieve high-cohesion (within teams) and 
low-coupling (between teams) : small, empowered teams, 
systematic pull requests, developer autonomy.<p>Our software engineering practices are also influenced 
by Antifragile [4] principles
(Small is Beautiful, Less is more, Hormesis principle, 
evolutionary darwinism, over-compensation ...)<p>And if you are on the Paleo diet, like hiking/camping or 
enjoy a good raclette you will certainly find friends here!<p><pre><code>    Next step
    =========
</code></pre>
If you are curious about the project and want to explore 
opportunities working with us, you can 
 - reach out to dev@omsignal.com
 - come hang out on IRC (irc.freenode.net #omsignal) to ask your questions<p>If you have a `github`/`bitbucket` account, we would love to take
a look at what you like doing 
(even if you feel ashamed of it in retrospective -- explain us 
what you would improve now)<p><pre><code>    Footnotes

They map Haskell types to other Haskell types, and Haskell functions to other Haskell functions.<p>A functor in Category Theory has two parts - a map of the objects and a map of the arrows.  In Haskell, when you create a Functor instance, you are saying &quot;this type constructor <i>is</i> the map for objects; here&#x27;s how you map the arrows&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s typically not the best place to start, but since you asked - a monad, in category theory, is a functor plus two natural transformations.  In Haskell, the functor is the type constructor plus fmap from the Functor instance.  The natural transformations are return (eta, in the math) and join (mu).  Haskell programmers have historically found it more useful to talk about bind than join, but in the presence of fmap you can implement either from the other, so there&#x27;s not much theoretical difference:<p><pre><code>   join m = bind m id

In the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed that  online entertainment is groping toward a new kind of business model where the artist just keeps working on a single property and never stops, escalating the ambitions and production values as the audience grows.<p>An example of what I&#x27;m talking about is the webcomic Homestuck, which started as some simple panels with text and now evolved to thousands of pages with intricate animations, musical pieces and even videogames spliced into one big narrative. From being written by a single person (who still has full creative control), the comic has gradually grown to have a dedicated art team, music team and gamedev studio.<p>An almost-example is the videogame Nuclear Throne. It&#x27;s currently being developed by a two-person studio, and the creators make a point of releasing new updates every single week and interacting with the audience constantly, talking to Redditors and building good relationships with Youtubers. By now it&#x27;s had 50+ weekly updates and just keeps going. A big part of me wants the game to never be &quot;finished&quot; but just stay in development forever, like a webcomic, becoming more ambitious as money permits. The game&#x27;s universe is certainly interesting enough to allow that kind of development, you could imagine all kinds of stories set inside the game, etc.<p>The awesome thing about this model is that you can start very small. Homestuck started with one guy, Nuclear Throne started with two guys. If you can keep growing the audience at every step, who&#x27;s to say that you can&#x27;t end up with a billion dollar movie franchise, or even crazier things?",1420234382

You need to consider the value of being able to provide trials (i.e., do not force potential customers to spend money upfront on software that might not fulfil their requirements), discounts for your long term repeat customers, the ability to communicate directly with them and resolve their problems.<p>If you want to run a sustainable business, whether the MAS is a net positive becomes a question mark. I have not seen much supporting data to suggest that the MAS is a net positive if we compare exclusive direct vs exclusive MAS over a long period of time.<p>Anecdotally, from the data I have on hand (conversations with customers and friends), almost no one discovered their Mac apps from the MAS (there&#x27;s some bias in my sample, of course). If they needed the software, they would have bought it - whether it&#x27;s outside or not doesn&#x27;t matter. If you need a tool for your job (the type of software I&#x27;m interesting in making), you&#x27;re not going pass on it just cause you have to enter your credit card. For other types of software, the more disposable ones, convenience plays a much bigger role.<p>And most importantly of all, it will all depend on the particular type of software that you&#x27;re selling. In my experience, the MAS works great for type of software that&#x27;s mostly consumable - cheap, disposable, no long term plan to keep it updated. For other types, where you plan to run a sustainable business over many years - I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>While you&#x27;ll probably do less units selling directly, you&#x27;ll be getting a significantly higher proportion of the sale price. It&#x27;s important to consider all aspects, not just raw revenue over a short period of time and make a decision from there - for some apps, the MAS would be the right way, for others - not so much. Now, deciding which way to go is a much, much harder question and I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s no easy way to come up with a definitive answer.",1420233773

Papers and magazines have never been shy about critiquing themselves. (At least, the better ones haven&#x27;t.) Back in the day, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see an editor at the <i>New York Times</i> take a staff reporter or columnist to task in a sidebar, or even in a followup story. And the role of ombudsman used to mean something. (Whereas today, it&#x27;s a very underappreciated and little-understood role.)<p>Second, we shouldn&#x27;t necessarily presume that writers at the same paper are coordinating with each other. Say what you will about that as a business practice. But it&#x27;s a fact of life at many publications, with distributed staffs, section-specific editors, shrinking numbers of full-timers, and ever-increasing numbers of independent contractors. I wouldn&#x27;t attribute to malice what can better be explained by uncoordinated action.<p>[EDIT: This comment got a downvote, and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because someone assumed I&#x27;m defending the Guardian here.

They thrived for similar reasons to today&#x27;s comic book movie franchises, and I think they will ultimately share the same fate.<p>Why do people go to comic book movies today?<p>1. They like knowing what they&#x27;re signing up for. As evidence, look at how movie trailers have evolved into Cliff Notes versions of movies over the last few decades.<p>2. This particular market had been ill-served; so anything catering to this niche was disproportionately rewarded. Comic book fans had long lamented that there were no big budget adaptions of their favorite books.<p>3. It&#x27;s easier to make variations on an established template from a production standpoint, and it&#x27;s easier to obtain financial backing when you can point to prior successes (the &quot;it&#x27;s like Uber but for Netflix&quot; startup syndrome).<p>It isn&#x27;t that comic book movies are creatively bankrupt by definition (nor were <i>The Thin Man</i> movies, and many other franchises over the years). They have a rich well of prior stories to draw on and splash together, and a lot of what Marvel in particular is doing with ongoing narratives is interesting. But they are also racing towards a saturation point which will inevitably result in the collapse of their entire enterprise. They have attracted a lot of good actors, directors and other collaborators; but even with all of that talent they are simply producing too much, too quickly to avoid reaching a point of creative and financial exhaustion.<p>As others have noted, it&#x27;s pretty laughable that Marvel and DC have announced slates that run all the way to 2020. They are certainly going to have to cancel or postpone some of those films when audience indifference becomes impossible to ignore. And then like other things that have oversaturated their markets (music / rhythm games), it&#x27;s going to be a long, dark winter before they get to show their faces in any respect again. I am certain that within the next ten years we&#x27;ll see articles and interviews talking about how &quot;comic book movies don&#x27;t sell&quot; and &quot;guys running around in spandex suits are passe&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, if you could approach this stuff in moderation, I think it might work out differently. Make a few comic book movies a year. Make them all distinct from each other. Don&#x27;t tell the same stories again and again and again (origin stories of characters that have existed for 80 years, for instance). Approach the material from the perspective of telling a story in a new way, rather than rehashing the same story for new money.<p>Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the way business is done in Hollywood or Silicon Valley or anywhere else. If someone makes money doing something, then thirty other people are going to try to reproduce that success, and many of them may have missed the point of how and why the original succeeded.",1420233104

Partly there was less demand for it in an age of political optimism; sci-fi has always been a way to address issues we don&#x27;t dare tackle head-on (see many post-2001 shows e.g. new BSG) and there was a brief period where we really thought we&#x27;d lived through the end of history.

Moviegoing internationally, especially in BRIC (Brazil-Russia-India-China) countries, is booming and has been for years. Moviegoing is stagnant to slowly dwindling in the US market.<p>The big blockbuster movies, especially the franchise films, are aimed at the global audience because they&#x27;re making much more money overseas than they&#x27;re doing domestically.  And the studios/distributors want to make money.  They don&#x27;t care about art or cultural meaning. They care about money.<p>Several years ago, PG posted a YC article called &quot;Kill Hollywood.&quot; I wrote a rebuttal with the mocking (and deliberately attention-grabbing) title &quot;Kill Y-Combinator&quot;. PG and YC laid out a mission to invent new businesses and platforms that provided ways for content creators, creative types, etc, to not have to deal with the mess that is Hollywood. I replied that while I agree Hollywood is a mess -- it&#x27;s a permission industry, they&#x27;re obsessed with rights and are ruthlessly litigious if they sense any infringement -- I felt PG&#x27;s article went too far. I suggested that all movies aren&#x27;t the problem, some are, the big dumb franchise ones. I argued there is a ton of great brilliant artistic talent in the industry, but they have a hell of a time getting their work to an audience. The studios and the financiers (usually, nowadays, foreign investors; banks, oil sheiks, etc.) want big international blockbusters (read: franchise repeat hits). The artistic filmmakers/directors/acting talent is getting squeezed out. Why do you think Soderbergh stopped making movies? He got sick of the Hollywood BS. I advocated and still do that Silicon Valley ought to strive to build new platforms that facilitate the good movie content reaching audiences at sufficient scale so that good films have a future and can make a difference.  I tried to do this with a startup, and got Silicon Valley money (seed round), but the resistance and loathing of anything M-word (Movie) related in the Valley is brutal. I could not get an A round, and my big seed investors walked away without even giving us a chance (lookin&#x27; at you, Google Ventures).<p>There remains an incredible opportunity for disruptive technology to come in and raise hell and make the moviegoing experience better for consumers, for filmmakers, for studios, and for the exhibitors.  The movie theater industry--separate from the studios, I&#x27;m talking about the cinemas themselves, which they themselves call &quot;exhibitors&quot;--is appallingly bad and inept at embracing technology to attract larger audiences and keep them coming back. Some small chains like Austin&#x27;s Alamo Drafthouse get it, and have figured out a way to make their theatres event destinations thanks to clever branding, great curation, great food and drink, and an overwhelming sense of entertainment and belonging. The AMCs of the world on the other hand exist basically to sell you insanely marked-up popcorn/soda/junk food, and could care less what is displayed on their screens as long as the entire experience is as monetized as possible.  And franchise films help them keep their unimaginative business model limping along year after year.<p>I believe that if we could get some decent and COMMITTED funding for innovating mobile/social/local tech that relates to the moviegoing experience, we could do a lot to wake up the greedy Hollywood execs to fund better and more varied content and the exhibitors would be less fearful on taking a chance on showing that content.  I would love to see this. I&#x27;ve already spent years of my life in this space, lost a ton of personal money in this space, but would be willing to give it a go again in a second if I could find the right alignment of stars (people, funding, filmmaker/exhibitor connections). I think it can be done without Hollywood&#x27;s permission or even involvement. It&#x27;s about the consumer and about the exhibitor. Hollywood only gives people what they believe they want. Better tech could make audiences way more aware of good movies they&#x27;re not hearing about now. If they know about it, and hear their friends wanna see it too, guess what: you get scalable demand. An exhibitor will do ANYTHING where there is demand. You just have to show it&#x27;s there. Who&#x27;s with me?",1420232786

Note that all of these have ways to create or interact with them other than the monad interface, but those differ from example to example (often substantially).  Monad captures one similarity, there are differences as well.<p>The list monad represents nondeterministic computation (&quot;nondeterministic&quot; in the sense of representing all possibilities, not in the sense of picking a random one).<p><pre><code>    List:
    return x = [x]
    bind xs f = concat (map f xs)
</code></pre>
Maybe represents computation with the possibility of failure.<p><pre><code>    Maybe:
    return x = Just x
    bind Nothing _ = Nothing
    bind (Just x) f = f x
</code></pre>
State carries some data that can be read and updated in the context of the computation.<p><pre><code>    State:
    return x = \ s -> (x, s)
    bind m f = \ s -> case m s of (x, s&#x27;) -> f x s&#x27;

</code></pre>
A Parser, from parsec, is a bit complicated internally for flexibility and error handling, but the gist is that it represents a parser action that may consume a portion of the input stream and produces a value.<p><pre><code>    Parser:
    return x: a parser that consumes nothing and produces x
    bind m f: a parser that runs parser m, passes the output to
        function f, and runs the resulting parser

</code></pre>
Functions that all take the same type can be treated as a monad.  This is often codified into Reader, to make things clearer.<p><pre><code>    ((->) r):
    return x = \ _ -> x
    bind m f = \ r -> f (m r) r
</code></pre>
And of course famously IO, representing actions that produce a value and may interact with the world at large, forms a monad.<p><pre><code>    IO:
    return x: an action which does nothing and produces x
    bind m f: an action which, when executed, executes m, applies f
        to the value produced, and then executes the result of f</code></pre>",1420232590

Wish I had a way to calculate that out from the tools I had which helps drastically during an investigation to sift through network logs.<p>What you seem to have built so far is what could be used to build a more modern shared secret access stack rather than being a full solution itself. Most companies that want to pay for something want to have something that will rotate out keys & passwords or enforce secrets policies like separation of keys across different nodes in your high availability solution for them (eg. the DB, root, and LDAP cached passwords should not be stored on the same data node even in encrypted form). Otherwise, a lot of companies have built equivalent solutions like Conjur already (to varying degrees of success depending upon how dysfunctional their IT already is). A lot of the custom solutions I&#x27;m familiar with in Defense / IC space are starting to use Apache Accumulo to enforce a great deal of sharing and storing of secrets. The architecture of that makes it possible to have tables split both column-wise and row-wise across multiple nodes based upon business rules like HIPAA, FISMA, PCI-DSS, etc. Tack on Zookeeper with some SASL and you&#x27;ll spend the next year or two just arranging the meetings to figure out the security rules.<p>For an analogy, it seems like you&#x27;ve built a lot of the workings of Postgres missing something important like procedural queries and triggers, but organizations really want an ORM (they just don&#x27;t even realize it because the whole industry is built around bikeshedding topics in security). Build something respecting the vernacular and culture of engineers, IT opsec / compliance, and (more importantly) the managers of both orgs and you should have a winner. Ok, after you find the right sales guys to get the attention of some F500s that are in terrible industries wracked by compliance BS 24/7.<p>All in all, good idea and it looks promising, I&#x27;ll keep your product in mind if I can get a management tool like this even suggested. We&#x27;re doing some extremely bad practices at present in order to avoid violating OTHER no-nos keeping stuff out of the public cloud, and our IAM across dozens and dozens of AWS accounts is completely bonkers and the bungling of the credentials as the after-effect is probably causing worse security problems than if we just gave them all the same keypairs. It&#x27;d be really interesting to see this work seamlessly across both AWS-like environments and a vSphere/vCAC/vCD type of environment using affinity / anti-affinity rules to make initial guesses about your security configuration. Pretty sure everything in an autoscaling group should be by default in the same group or &quot;layer&quot; (in your terminology), for example, and you could start with the same for vSphere compute clusters, unless host anti-affinity rules for a VM are present, which usually means that the VM is not allowed to cross a physical boundary and is a hint at a business level policy rather than a technical one (nobody does cross-geographic clusters besides Google last I saw, and you probably aren&#x27;t going to be able to sell this to them....).<p>One thing that would tremendously help in your documentation would be to provide security scenarios for different user stories and potential users. Admins across multiple tenant business units have different use cases than developers that are working in maybe one or two organizations / groups, for example. I found myself expecting a &quot;I am a... X, Y, Z&quot; set of tabs and wanted to see each of their use case scenarios for one or two sample companies with different needs. Besides the &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be your guinea pig&quot; mentality, this is what companies are really looking for half the time they ask for a reference customer.",1420232428

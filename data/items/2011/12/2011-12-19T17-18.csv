3370396,comment,3369684,3369684,2,0,erickhill,,,"Many pubs claimed to go 'digital first' in the mid-2000s (e.g. InfoWorld, a 25 year old publication even dumped print entirely). But the cost of unique content creation often still far outweighed the cost of production. And online, it's still easier to run a ""story"" about an iPhone rumor to generate traffic than real hard news or investigative journalism. Soon, all pubs start to re-publish the same tired crap in the race for pageviews and everything gets watered down.<p>Content <i>can</i> be a lot cheaper to produce and promote if you aren't the content originator (e.g. Associated Press is literally everywhere now) but it's death by a thousand cuts more often than not for publishers that go this route.<p>Unless one has simply massive online traffic, the advertising model that propped up print for so long is broken online. Print is mostly free from delivering hard metrics with the exception of circulation numbers. Online, pure visits and ad impressions are never enough. Thus, an impossible slippery slope forms creating a paradox of expectations between ""engagement"" with vendor content and ""real content.""<p>In all reality, the ""digital first"" strategy is impossible for many publishers as the subscription dollars are almost free money for them. The lure of another $20 annual subscription is too great. And the growth necessary to survive, so hard.",1324317534

3370386,comment,3366167,3369943,1,0,latchkey,,,"What I am hearing is a few things:<p>a) You are upset about the fact that they increased their prices when they transitioned from a well documented beta service to a fully supported commercial offering.<p>b) You are upset that there is some features missing, such as the way DNS is handled.<p>c) You are upset that there is a proprietary nature about the service.<p>I think those are all pretty much valid concerns, but let me address them:<p>Yes, the costs did go up for some people, including you, it seems. But remember again, it wasn't just some random increase. They switched out of beta. There was never a hint at a promise that they would keep the prices at the same level.<p>As I mentioned before, they admitted they messed up in their messaging. They heard people screaming at them loud and clear and went back and actually adjusted a lot of their prices. You say that AWS won't increase prices because of costs decreasing, I can only hope that GAE, with a similar model will do the same.<p>That said, you really can't compare GAE with AWS because they are entirely different offerings. You absolutely need an IT staff (be it yourself or someone else) to run, monitor and manage those servers on AWS. You don't need that with GAE and I find that to be a massive selling point. I've seen first hand what happens when you have to hire IT staff or stay up at 3am figuring out what server problems you are having. It sucks because a) it is nearly impossible to hire good sysadmins right now, b) who wants to be on call 24/7? There is also the lack of the high replication datastore on AWS. There is nothing even close. Personally, I'm willing to have a bit of vendor lockin for those features.<p>Yes, features are missing. Google knows about it and has been doing regular releases of the SDK to address missing features. I'm pretty confident that as the service becomes more profitable for them, they will dedicate more resources to it. If not, then I have 3 years to migrate and find something else. For now, the feature set is good enough for me. That might not have been the case for you, but that isn't entirely the fault of anyone. It is still a maturing product.",1324317380

3370198,comment,3370034,3370034,10,0,jackityquack,,,"Good story, but a strange guy. Also, he could probably do more good for his country by selling his product. He would actually disrupt the industry, instead of creating yet another charity project.
The way to fight poverty isn't to give poor people poor solution. The way to think about it is that you need to level the playing field, so even Indians would laugh at making their own napkins. If you told a white American do make their own napkin, they'd laugh if your face. But we seem to think it's reasonable for an Indian to do it. That's absurd. 
If he creates a better industry, he can keep the profits in India. He can then employ persons who will be rich enough to afford to not make their own napkins. That money will trickle out in to the economy and create a richer India. The only solution to poverty is economics. And you can't become an economic super power on charity.<p>You can stop reading if you get the point, the rest is a rant:
Another example that everyone loves of agriculture. Have you ever heard of a success story through teaching farmers to use non-industrial machinery? Hell NO! You can't win that way. You need to find a way for farmers to compete in the real world, not coddle them. Microfinance them or something. Maybe teach them to partner with a company with the money to buy all the right supplies (tractor, fertilizer, etc) that can actually turn his land in to profit. Then he isn't charity, he's a businessman. Charity is not the solution for people like me (by which I mean a healthy person that can work, since there's no difference between me and another 23 year old in any country in the world).",1324314221

I think it's because they can't afford a proper medical mask, they are using a scarf or something similar [Especially keeping the story in mind that this machine is supposed to make napkins for poor women].

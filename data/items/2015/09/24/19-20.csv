They need to be dealt with as separate issues.<p>Violence from intoxication depends on the drug. Alcohol is probably the worst, followed by amphetamines and cocaine. Nobody wants to break a nose because they&#x27;re high on pot. So the laws don&#x27;t line up with violent potential.<p>Violence from getting money for drugs is because drugs are expensive, and addicts tend to be social outcasts. It&#x27;s also incidental to property crime in general.<p>Violence from drug sales is 100% the result of prohibition. During alcohol Prohibition, alcohol business crime was widespread. Today, it&#x27;s nonexistent. Likewise, there&#x27;s virtually no violence in the field of loosely handled prescription drugs. If drugs (not just marijuana, but hard drugs like cocaine and heroin) were broadly legalized and readily available in a safe and competitive market, violence from both the drug trade and the cost of drug addiction would disappear.<p>Which makes one ask, &quot;Why do we do this?&quot;, when it makes so little sense. Then one might answer, &quot;Is racism a root cause of the war on drugs?&quot;, and a whole bunch of people would howl with indignation.",1443124681

Multiple tasks that are CPU bound simply cannot be managed using cooperative multitasking, and that&#x27;s all asyncio is: cooperative multitasking, with a friendlier syntax than the old asyncore module.<p>Cooperative multitasking using async I/O works great when you have lots of tasks running that are I/O bound--they spend almost all of their time waiting for network or disk reads/writes. But as soon as you start piling up tasks that require CPU, you need either multiple threads or multiple processes. Python asyncio was never intended to handle that use case.<p>Multiple threads is where Python has a unique limitation: the GIL prevents multiple threads from running on multiple cores, so if you want multiple CPU bound tasks to use multiple cores, you need to fork each one into a separate process.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that the multiprocessing module is, IMO, a huge ball of cruft that&#x27;s overkill for a lot of multitasking use cases. But there are simpler ways to do it, at least on Unix systems, because the fork system call is very lightweight.<p>Shameless plug: I wrote a library for this some time ago, which I use whenever I have a Python project that needs to fork worker processes; it&#x27;s the &quot;comm&quot; sub-package in my plib-io Python distribution (this is the Python 3 version):<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/pdonis/plib3-io/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/pdonis/plib3-io/src</a>",1443124594

Due to how the machine operates, it&#x27;s a mixture of vector cutting lines for the fine lines and tile edges, and bitmap images for the raster fill and shading. The vector lines are easy to change in color by adjusting DOM attributes, while for the fill images I change the colors on a pixel-by-pixel basis before spitting out the finished SVG files in a client side-made zip file.<p>This was helpful because beyond the laser power settings, it took some fiddling to get the right shades of gray for cutting depths that worked with the multilayer plywood I was using (some layers are darker than others; had to make it look good). The files can also of course be colored for printing.<p>The different regions are segmented by their colors in the original files, which were created via Inkscape with outline vector lines over bitmap fill images. The lines were drawn by hand by my girlfriend and I using Inkscape, based on a purchased copy of Carcassonne we have. The images were made by rendering the outline SVGs to PNGs, filling in regions using GIMP, then reimporting them into Inkscape, and overlaying the vector outlines.<p>For meeple, she laboriously cut them out by hand from Sculpey clay.

Once a week, they would take a marble out of the bowl and throw it away.  Each marble was a week of their life.  When they started this practice, they calculated their life expectancy and bought enough marbles for each week they were statistically expected to live.  The idea is to give you the constant reminder that our time is limited, always running out, and shouldn&#x27;t be wasted.  The older you get, the less time you have, and the fewer marbles that are left in that bowl.  If you are a typical HN reader, you likely have less than 3,000 marbles left.",1443123835

I know they are legion, but now that my kids are adults and I am divorced (etc) and I have arranged my life such that work can be the most important thing I focus on, I still find it challenging to cope with the fact that so many men see me as just a skirt. When a man sees me that way, it matters little whether he is hoping to get into my panties or not, he will take me seriously as a professional and he will never be a stepping stone to better things for me. He will either be a closed door because he doesn&#x27;t take me seriously or he will be an even bigger obstacle and source of pain, while I try to neutralize the threat his unwanted sexual interest represents for me.<p>This is something you likely almost never face as a man in the world of work.",1443123448

It&#x27;s also more anonymous than direct payments.<p>2) Ads do work. Very well.

10274067,comment,10273849,10273849,0,0,saidajigumi,,,"Many years ago, Eclipse as a whole had a few promising points:<p>* Open-source, with an apparently large community<p>* Extensible within itself via plugins<p>* Some interesting GUI features:<p><pre><code>  * User- and plugin- definable and customizable \n    &quot;perspectives&quot; that captured specific workflows, e.g.\n    debugging, language X editing, schema editing, etc.\n\n  * For its time, relative to other IDEs (Visual Studio,\n    I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; at you) a much easier approach to managing\n    panes and tabs to the user&#x27;s liking.\n\n  * The fantastic ability to quickly narrow the settings \n    pane navigation via text search. OS X&#x27;s System \n    Preferences later added a similar feature to find & \n    narrow pref panes based on a keyword search.  I still \n    feel that there&#x27;s untapped opportunity  for GUIs and \n    traditional editor modes (emacs/vim) to leverage \n    spinoffs from this interaction model.\n</code></pre>\nThat said, Eclipse never seemed to surmount what I feel were its major difficulties:<p>* The Workspace -- IMO the most absolutely toxic abstraction an IDE has ever had.  All &quot;projects&quot; must live under a &quot;workspace&quot; which is both an on-disk top-level directory+data that users must cope with above their project(s) and an inescapable in-code monstrosity that plugin writers must also cope with.  This was a mimicking of other IDEs that thought it was a good idea to maintain an entire separate organizational data structure for code that created a separate hierarchy that duplicated and obscured the on-disk organization, and a short-sighted hard-coding of a Java-centric mindset where any non-trivial codebase was certainly going to consist of multiple interdependent projects.  The Workspace was a core architectural disaster.  A symptom: it made Eclipse ridiculously painful to use to, e.g., &quot;just edit a python file&quot;.  Contrast with TextMate&#x27;s lightweight approach of &quot;a directory is a project&quot; and fast in-project navigation/fuzzy search tools.  No state was required other than what was on disk.  TextMate&#x27;s full power and bundles were available with zero friction for either project-centric for file-centric work.<p>* Speed -- The more time goes on, the less excusable Eclipse&#x27;s dog-slow performance is.  Early on, it was easy to overlook its slugishness, because reasons.  Some recent work has had me suddenly delving back into (two different!) Eclipse projects, and its amazing just how the poor the UI responsiveness compares to other modern environments, even on screamingly fast hardware.<p>* Extensibility schizophrenia -- Despite Eclipse being extensible through plugins, those were really envisioned as third-party shippable modules.  User configuration was a separate second-class sytem, entirely GUI-managed, and a major pain to clone to a new system.  Compare to how Emacs & Vim work with a VCS-managed home directory, or even just a zip file or tarball.  In no small part, this came from Eclipse&#x27;s foundations on an early Java/JVM compiled-only mindset.  With no scriptability baked into that platform, there was little choice but to have a strong divide between code (plugin) vs. data (configuration).",1443123313

My 2c on this:<p>a. the physical exercise that a dog needs is also good for you and can help stave off the depression that can easily accompany loneliness.<p>b. social interaction is tiring for some people. How you got your dog, what your dog is like and so on is an easy, low-effort conversation to have, and it&#x27;s also one that can be managed without causing offense - if you&#x27;re tired or having a bad day, you can always cite a need to walk the dog home. This allows you to enjoy some friendly conversation without needing to locate it in any kind of semantic framework (eg &#x27;is this person being friendly or just networking with me&#x27;).<p>c. dogs are very generous emotionally and also very reliable. They will try to trick you into playing ball or possibly destroy on of your shoes and try to hide it, but basically you don&#x27;t need to second-guess them the way you do people (including yourself). Your dog doesn&#x27;t care what anyone else thinks of you and likes seeing you happy. It may be a simple friendship but it&#x27;s a very sincere one.<p>d. over time, your dog is in many ways a reflection of you, a four-legged psychological mirror, if you like. If you choose, you can learn and adjust things about yourself through observing how your dog responds to you. If you need to make life changes, your dog doesn&#x27;t need you to explain them.<p>So while a dog won&#x27;t cure loneliness, they&#x27;re excellent at helping you deal with it.",1443121899

Equally I had to make a choice that I believed would work for my client in the medium-term, especially if I was not able to continue with the project at a future date.<p>This is my perspective (from the intellectual gutter): Javascript is hard to read and hard to reason about. It&#x27;s also hard to achieve a style that I am entirely comfortable with. It&#x27;s changing very fast. You learn things on the backend that are years from being universally useable on the frontend. Also: I seem to write <i>so many lines of code</i>.<p>That said I think I made the right choice. Ultimately the isomorphism argument is correct: at least I&#x27;m reasoning about the same kinds of things every day. I just came off 6 months of programming only Elixir and I could have used Phoenix for the backend, but I think I would have found the constant shifts in perspective very disruptive.<p>Which leads me to my main point: It isn&#x27;t about the language.<p>After all, multi-threaded programs in a more conventional language are also very hard to reason about. Shared data is hard to reason about. Immutable data is also hard to reason about (or rather its consequences are hard to reason about). Message passing can also become hard to reason about. Pointers are hard to reason about. Functional composition starts out simple and then...you guessed it: it gets hard to reason about. Once things get to a certain level of complexity, once you get using anything to its full potential you find the place in which it&#x27;s going to make your head hurt.<p>And for the plodders among us the answer is: libraries and patterns. Specifically, other people&#x27;s libraries and other people&#x27;s patterns.<p>So my recommendation to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like Javascript: if you don&#x27;t have to JS, don&#x27;t. If you do, at least enjoy the good things:<p>* Promises: One of those things you only appreciate by trying to do it <i>the other way</i>: <a href=""http://callbackhell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://callbackhell.com/</a>\n* ES6: a lot of great features here. Makes an Elixirite feel almost at home: destructuring(pattern matching), arrow functions, generators and iterators\n* Libraries: Amazing number of libraries. I have barely had to code one really smart thing myself.\n* JSON: Think in JSON all day - now that&#x27;s nice. Serializing things to Lists, Maps, Tuples and what have you gets old.<p>And also read books:<p>*  David Herman: Effective Javascript\n*  Marijn Haverbeke: Eloquent Javascript\n*  Daniel Parker: Javascript with Promises\n*  Douglas Crockford: Javascript, The Good Parts (well actually I found this one hard to reason about :) )...",1443121887

The air filter is definitely a good idea. If you do the math on the volume, and compare it to the actual volume of the filter of e.g. a Purex, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s similar. Almost half  of the volume of the Purex is in the fans or open airspace; we have the advantage of a ton of airflow from the Glowforge itself, so the filter needs proportionately less. We also have a sealed (basic) or almost-sealed (pro) case so it&#x27;s easier to build up negative pressure and move the exhaust through.<p>Cleaning stinks, and wrecks alignment - the tube and turning mirrors are completely sealed, including the tube output, so there&#x27;s just one flat window to wipe clean (and it unscrews for easy replacement). The head has a window and purge air to keep it clean too.<p>We&#x27;re mitigating a lot of the risk of fire by avoiding trouble situations in software (e.g. not cutting a piece of material where the dimensions make it an effective wick, detecting obstacles on the bed, accelerators to detect problems quickly) but you&#x27;re right that you don&#x27;t want to run it unattended.",1443121434

They cannot make laws and they cannot stop laws from being carried out.<p>-  This means his executive order to delay the employer mandate - but only for certain businesses. He said he will not enforce the mandate for businesses with 50-100 employees, but will enforce it for business with more than 100 employees.<p>THAT is effectively writing new a law. Congress said it starts at 50, but Obama says it starts at 100. By the constitution, <i></i>only<i></i> congress has this power, not the POTUS.<p>-  Another example is his changes to the DACA act to include illegals who entered the country before 2010. Again, this is not something he has the power to do. By actively not enforcing exiting laws, and then creating his own set of criteria on who can stay in the US and who cannot, he&#x27;s subverted the existing immigration laws and replacing it with his own.<p>-  Another good example is how he said that person or business that doesn&#x27;t support LGBT nondiscrimination cannot receive a business contract with the government. This means if a Muslim doesn&#x27;t want to bake a cake for a gay couple, the government has the right to refuse to do business with them.<p>I won&#x27;t even start with how unconstitutional such a law would be if it was passed by congress. Considering this is already protected under the Free Exercise Clause of the first amendment which states no citizen can be <i>required</i> to forfeit their right to do business with the federal government.<p>Again, only congress has the ability pass a law like this, but Obama did so anyways.<p>This is the issue with his orders. It has nothing to do with how many orders he&#x27;s making, it&#x27;s how he&#x27;s using them. Effectively creating or overriding existing laws as he sees fit - something the POTUS should not have the power to do.",1443121367

People can argue about the reasons, but it&#x27;s pretty indisputable in the data that this burden is more likely to fall on the mother than the father.<p>However, the study (again, I can&#x27;t cite it, apologies for that) suggested that those men who <i>do</i> take time off from work for child care may face an unusually harsh career penalty for it.  In short, employers don&#x27;t like it when either parent takes time off to watch kids, but they may be particularly resentful when a man does it.<p>Do you think there may be harsher judgement for men who do this, something akin to pressure not to take paternity leave?",1443121321

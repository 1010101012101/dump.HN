Would be great, still today, the very simple (non AS3/vector based) Racing game (<a href=""http://mozilla.github.com/shumway/examples/racing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mozilla.github.com/shumway/examples/racing/</a>) you are running through Shumway requires around 70% of CPU usage on my MacBook Pro against 11% with Flash Player. A game which would consume even less in Flash Player if it used AS3 and simple bitmap blitting techniques. Yes, JS performance will improve, and efforts like River Trail are promising, but we are still far from that, I am a little worried we are setting the wrong expectations here.<p>2. The restaurant websites.
Yes, there are a lot of these restaurant websites using Flash. And to be fair, they should never have used Flash for that. But you are right most of them are porting these to HTML and it works nicely. But fortunately Flash on the web is not used for restaurant websites only, especially games. Today Flash Player is used to power 9 of the top 10 Facebook games with content like FarmVille 2, CityVille, Kings Road, Ruby Blast, Angry Birds targeting around 30 million daily users are powered with Flash Player using Stage3D and without Flash, we would all be playing Racing games like the one mentioned earlier. Or maybe faster games, but with NaCl in Chrome only? ;)<p>3. You don't see Flash rallying on desktop, or even via Air on Android.
Thanks to Stage3D, AIR is actually becoming more and more serious for game developers. Most developers wanting to develop games on desktop, iOS and Android are facing big issues when it comes to fragmentation and AIR solves that. All the mobiles games here <a href=""http://gaming.adobe.com/showcase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gaming.adobe.com/showcase/</a> are using AIR.<p>Thibault",1352882786

The RIAA offers to settle for a very reasonable amount--only a few dollars a song, which is far far below what it would normally cost to license a song to make available for free, unrestricted public redistribution. (And that is the correct license to compare to, not the $1 license that one purchases to download a song and use it privately).<p>If the person does not accept and the RIAA sues, it would make little sense to sue over all the songs. For each song named, they have to ensure that certain formalities have been taken care of (such as copyright registration) have been taken care of for those songs, and make sure the necessary rights have been assigned to them, and they have to submit into evidence documentation that proves all of this. They also have to show that each song being shared is really the song they are suing over (as opposed to a misnamed file of some other song, for instance).<p>Why go to all that effort, when suing over a dozen or two songs is sufficient to put the minimal damages at more than they have already indicated they are willing to accept to settle?<p>I don't see how this is using the legal system ""as a weapon"". It's using it exactly how it is supposed to be used--someone violates their rights, they make a very reasonable offer to settle the matter out of court, the person refuses, and then they take the person to court.",1352881211

One can howl at the moon over these developments but is it really desirable to revert to an older day where a faithful employee's reward for long-term service was getting a gold watch on retirement or a $10K bonus for having invented the thing that made the employer hundreds of millions?</i><p>No, today's reality of burning out and getting the short end of the stick when the startup you worked for folds (as statistically most of them do) is much better.<p>You write as if startups have replaced big corporations. In fact, startups employ an insignificant number of people compared to big corporations -- and most startups just crash and burn instead of being bought for a nice sum or turning into a regular company. So the payoff is there only for a tiny minority of startup employees (and mostly, founders).<p>So, to rephrase your question: ""is it really desirable to revert to an older day where a faithful employee's reward for long-term service was getting a gold watch on retirement or a $10K bonus, compared to the current startup reality, in which employees are worked to the bone while rarely seeing anything for it in the vast majority of cases when the company crashes or even get shafted if the company makes it big?""<p>Hell, yeah.",1352881129

Montage offers very similar features Angular does, but with different design decisions and offer more. Montage has a very clean Component structure that are offer complete encapsulation and uses pure HTML5 templates: real document and no string based templating language in markup , no new tags to remember either, but a real object serialization that maintain a clean separation. Montage offers 2 way data bindings with converters, property change observing, delayed drawing for maximum draw rate etc... Montage today is server agnostic unlike Derby or Meteor. Don't get me wrong, that approach is very exciting and I want to see Montage go there, but we're focusing on taking front-end HTMLr applications to the next level, working with whatever backend you may have or like.

They continuously mention how they can't believe how simple a lot of things are. Whereas the first guy seems to have already formed opinions about how difficult something is before actually trying it. He also procrastinates quite a bit (I believe it's because he thinks things are harder/bigger than they really are)  the challenge with him has been to break his misconceptions (Git is difficult, The command line shouldn't be used etc.) and to just get on with it.<p>Oh and a bit off topic, but just to mention that one of the other guys is a girl and after a few months of seeing her code, I think every team should be comprised of as many women as there are men (and be more diverse in general). It might just be her, but she approaches some problems in a completely different way to the rest of the team and her perspective has saved us from banging our heads against the wall many times. She also notices things that the rest of us are oblivious to.

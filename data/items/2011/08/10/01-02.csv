If you can only learn one ""functional"" language and you do anything with the web, I'd recommend Javascript (if you don't already know it).  It's viable in the front and backends.<p>I'd personally recommend Haskell.  It's going to stretch your brain (in a good way), and helps reinforce all the ""functional"" concepts.  It's one of the very few purely functional languages, and it does have a bit of a learning curve to get started with, but I think it's worth the work.  There's a lot of library support, and almost all the sample code you find online in tutorials is well written.  You can pretty much do whatever you'd like with Haskell (Web servers like Yesod, to all kinds of fun AI/ML stuff).  If you're into computer science theory, you'll find as much as you'd ever want with Haskell.  The GHC (compiler) has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism (likely in most cases as good or better performance than Erlang).<p>If you're a quant looking into building a trading algorithm OCaml is a good choice.",1312941596

Functional programming languages generally are, but as we trend farther and farther toward the age where massively parallelizable systems become not only the commonplace but the requirement, the concurrency model constructed by this magnificent language will soon break the decades of academic brainwashing into object oriented systems thinking and herald a new dawn of glory for all those who believe in the power and practicality of this. This masterpiece proudly draws from the Greek ""Eros"" or love combined with the historic ""Battle of Lang Vei,"" thus symbolizing the eternal struggle of love of a craft and obsession over one's work to perfect and scrape away until only pure Truth and Beauty remain in the ultimate simplicity of expression.<p>This struggle has been known for centuries as a tenet of Buddhist philosophy, but has a subtler influence on Judeo-Christian philosophy which is most commonly attributed to the cultural exchange facilitated by the trade and social focus on the Silk Road and all that it brought. During the crusades many armies encountered this life-changing philosophical view when rerouted through Pakistan in order to attack from an unexpected direction and encountering monks from India who were seeking enlightenment.<p>These influences, though not part of the dogma at the time of original crafting of the first biblical books, are thought to have been added somewhere between the late thirteen the mid fourteen-hundreds when viking mercenaries continually pillaged the surrounding coastal lands. During this time many of the original copies, particularly in what is now modern-day Ireland, were burned in the chaos and the monks tasked to copy the holy books laboriously by hand took certain liberties in their transcriptions. This is notably evident in Paul's 5th letter to the Corinthians which reads:<p>""And lo, the angels shall hark in the heavens and the field may yet burn, but the love and the struggle to proclaim the great word of God shall remain in the hearts of all righteous men, and when the final day comes, they shall have their reward."" -- Corinthians 3, verse 145<p>This clearly illustrated the founding principles of both the struggles of duality illustrated by the monks and the same ideas which later contributed to Erlang.",1312940455

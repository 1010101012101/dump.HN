What GPL does is force developers to release their code.<p>They only have to release their code if they are using someone else's GPL licenced code. They are totally free not to use GPL licenced code, we can argue the semantics of 'freedom' until the cows come home but nobody is forced to use someone elses GPL licenced code.<p>>A BSD license benefits the market and end user,<p>It benefits the proprietary market, and if you want your code to be able to be used in proprietary projects then yes, BSD is indeed a great choice. I don't see how the end user is better served by BSD than GPL.<p>However, many developers pouring hundreds of hours into code they then release as open source do not have any intention of having that code end up in proprietary projects. They want the code to remain open so that they as end users will be able to recieve any enhacements done to their source code. And given the vast popularity of the GPL licence, particularly for open source applications then I'd say it's serving it's purpose.<p>And don't take me wrong, I think programmers releasing BSD licenced code are extremely generous, and I personally think BSD/MIT style licenced code is a better choice for single purpose library/framework/component style code where there's little risk of proprietary forks.<p>At the end of the day GPL is about the source code and any further enhancements to it being made available to recipients, and this is what has made it so popular. And while that means it can't be used by proprietary code projects, we have ample proof that it's a licence through which lots of companies chose to cooperatively develop open source code, likely due to the very fact that all distributors of that source code is legally bound to release any enhancements.",1328406947

I was trying to develop the app with my techical co-founder, but he's recently acting very strange since we got accepted to the program; he's currently studying computer science, and is in his third year, i have tried to meet up with him but he says every time that he's really busy,and i'm sometimes thinking that he doesn't want to help me anymore, because i think he's too scared of dropout of collenge and leave his family to work in san francisco.
Before i was trying to make this app, like 1 year and a half ago, i was starting an ecommerce webiste; something like p2p commerce with some cool technologies, i had 1 one cofounder that was very helpful at that time and helped me with the idea development, so when we start doing some work i invite him to help me with the development; i have to say that i'm not a coder i have tried and been to java and php courses but i've found that that's not my thing, i love selling the product and business, i think that, that's what i'm really good at.. In fact i meet this person(techical cofounder) in a java course, and beacame friends..<p>He has accepted to help me with the product but i've seen that he's not very commited to help, he preferes developing apps that adds lol and troll faces to people, i think this doesn't change or help to improve the world.<p>The company that i'm starting is app,that its really a social magazine for shopping(very interactive, similar to flipboard) i'm not going to say my secret sauce, but i'm really passionate about this, my technical cofounder was going to develop the adroid app and  i was trying to search a developer for the iphone, but now that my cofounnder is gone, i have nothing now, i'm really sad, i couldn't try to learn objective c beacuase i haven't a mac right know and i think i will need large amounts of time to learn it, i really don't want to waste this opportunity because of my cofounder.<p>So if anyone here is interested in help me out with this app please contact me at my e-mail: arturo_g_p@hotmail.com, or here... I could give you some equitity in exchange... You need to be able tomove to san francisco to work in the company within the accelerator program...

3553014,comment,3552290,3552918,5,0,imperator,,,"1. All one-way valves depend on flow. If there is a higher pressure from A to B. And that's the direction of resistance, then in a valve with moving parts, a ball or diaphragm of some sort would be pushed against a lip, and the flow would stop. That still depends on a pressure difference where flow was traveling from some high pressure point to some low pressure point. Let's say that valve was off design for the flow rate. It may not have enough pressure to seal, and it would still be leaky. The Tesla Valve's performance is measured by its diodicity, and it has to be matched to the conditions it's supposed to exist in. If it was really well designed, it's diodicity would be very high and thus leakage would be minimized. From an engineering standpoint it still usually makes sense to use valves with moving parts on your example lox tank. As the main way of checking flow, they are well understood and very reliable. However, if you are in a situation where a moving part is a negative, like in microfluidics, a Tesla valve might make more sense.<p>2. Liquids and gases have different viscosity, so the Tesla Valve would be different for each fluid and flow regime. I am unfamiliar with this series-of-petals geometry you are remembering. However, it reminds me of this excellent work done on optimizing topology for different Reynolds numbers in Tesla Valves: <a href=""http://www.senlin41.org/topology-optimization-of-tesla-type-microvalve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.senlin41.org/topology-optimization-of-tesla-type-...</a><p>3. One of the original intents of the valve was for Tesla's Bladeless Disc Turbine. In Tesla's time, materials were not what they are now, and thus valves with moving parts were not as reliable. Also, getting a valve that can close and open with high frequency is not always easy. The valvular conduit that Tesla designed was his solution to this problem.<p>Thanks for the book reference. I read ""Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla"" But I hadn't seen this other book. I might pick it up.",1328406512

It's the ongoing maintenance to ensure close to 100% uptime so you don't lose any mail.  Having worked as a sysadmin maintaining linux boxes for several companies, mail server maintenance accounted for the vast majority of the hours we spent working on servers.  This doesn't even account for the hardware upkeep to keep RAID sets in good shape, tape backups, etc.<p>2. There is simply no open source project that offers a UI anywhere close to as good as gmail.  Yes, someone could take on that project, but it will be years before they achieve a similarly polished result.<p>3. Sure you could roll your own filtering that would be more effective than gmail's, for you.  Again, this is further work that you have to do whereas gmail ""just works"".<p>4.

It prevents them from learning how to intellectually stimulate themselves, or be alone for any meaningful period of time, both of which are absolutely indispensable survival adaptations for childhood and adult life. The best parenting for the average American parent I've run into is less parenting.<p>I also have the sneaking suspicion that people delay or refrain from having kids here more due to the implied premise that having them is a life-consuming ordeal that totally, completely dominates adult consciousness. It shouldn't do that.<p>Yes, having kids changes your life, but you're still you. You do not live at the pleasure of your child.  When hanging out with adult friends with kids, it absolutely astounds me that they end up repeating the same sentence ten times because their kid keeps interrupting them, in a tireless quest for attention.  If I did that, my parents would've belted me silly.  I guess that's ""child abuse"" here.  Either way, aside from a good spanking, the best thing my parents ever did for me was ignore me a lot.

Is that correct?<p>2) I think there is another variation on this valve for liquids, is that right? This version is for gasses, the valve for liquids looks like a series of petals. Is that right or did I imagine it?<p>3) Was the original intent of this valve to prevent back pressure from the blade turbine?<p>Thanks,

The only thing that is available is a paid service where you can call phone numbers from Skype to your SIP trunk<p>so, there's a huge world of SIP telephony, and another huge world of Skype users. And they don't talk to each other.<p>I'm not considering dirty hacks which bind Asterisk or FreeSWITCH with a Skype GUI client installed on the same machine.",1328403671

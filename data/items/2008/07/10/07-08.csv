242168,comment,242164,242164,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'll start.<p>Graphics rendering has been known to be embarrassingly parallel for decades.  And, generally graphics rendering can absorb as many nodes as you throw at it.  I'm sure that dedicated graphics processors are always going to be better at rendering than generic processors, but perhaps OS makers are going to be including a lot more eye candy in the OS once they can establish 128 cores as a minimum specification for their OS install.<p>Ray traced desktops?  Icons with fur simulations or fluid dynamics?",1215676716

Deception is playing every hand the same way, such that your opponent can't deduce what you hold from your betting patterns. For instance, though it would clearly be a losing strategy, if someone raised at every possible opportunity, their range would always be 100% of all possible hands and you'd never have the slightest clue what they hold.<p>This is no less relevant against a bot than it is against a human. Odds are no more relevant against a bot than they are against a human.<p>The math is so trivial to calculate as to be irrelevant. And if you think humans make far more mistakes than machines, you should try downloading poki and playing a full ring game.",1215676711

More often I tend to see proprietary software left in the dust as in the case of Apache vs IIS unless I look for niches.<p>Can you cite any good examples of well-known new proprietary software that is clearly superior then their open source alternatives?<p>Note I say ""open source"" and not ""free"".",1215676528

242160,comment,241603,241892,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Folding the business because you think a government order is unethical would land you in jail. When you run a publicly traded company, you have a legal responsibility to represent your shareholders' financial interest.<p>If you want to be technical, the Bill of Rights does not secure the right to use a phone without the government knowing who you call. In fact, it doesn't even secure the right to privacy. It kind of flirts with the issue, but it's a common misconception that it guarantees it.<p>Maybe I'm biased because I think patriotism is stupid (as Shaw said ""Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it."") but if captains of industry folded their corporations every time they perceived an ethical violation we'd have no stock market left.",1215676052
242159,comment,241975,241975,0,0,ivey,,,"The problem with the apps described in the article is that they've attempted to make as much money as possible, instead of figuring out how to serve patients better.<p>My doctor doesn't charge my $30 for a phone call, or to give me a prescription.  Doing it online benefits <i>both</i> of us...so why would I pay extra for it?<p>I know a company in Norcross, GA doing web apps for doctors submitting insurance claims, so there's definitely some traction for webapps in the docs' offices.<p>If someone decides to run with this, let me know, and I'll pass along a few connections.",1215675868

242157,comment,241603,242032,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Again, how do you know this without consulting an attorney? You keep spouting legal facts that may or may not be true (I'll give you the benefit of the doubt) but are you, the CEO of a publicly traded corporation, going to simply say no because you think, despite no real legal expertise, that you are never legally required to help an investigation? Or are you going to consult with attorneys? What about the small guy who owns a video rental store that makes $40k a year in profit for him? He's going to have to go plunk down 10% of his yearly earn on a retainer just to discover that fact.<p>And even if what you say is true, which it surely could be, and even if it were common knowledge, it's still irrelevant. Corporations don't exist to police the government, it's the other way around. Penalizing a private enterprise for cooperating with a government agency's request is ridiculous.",1215675664

See <a href=""http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/papers/poker1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/papers/poker1.pdf</a> , pages 7-8, theorem 2. In a nutshell, it works because the opponent can't be sure if you have a very bad hand or a very good hand. Yes, it's a simplified model, but my game theory book says a computer analysis of straight poker gives the same result: when given the worst possible hand, you should always bluff.",1215674551

242142,comment,241493,241493,0,0,donw,,,"I've got a Dell 24"", and opted for the more expensive version aimed at graphics designers, because the optical properties of the LCD are quite a bit better than the 'consumer' line. That, and it replaced a ten-year-old 19"" ViewSonic PF790, so this goes to show you how often I buy monitors.<p>My advice is to go for quality over size.  There are cheap 30"" monitors that cost as much as my 24"", but I can work on this thing all day and not feel fatigued.",1215674094

Many times they are happy to pay for this help - but now we are looking at a different market completely.  (The smart VPS hosters are using forums and wikis to let the customers help each other out.)<p>Secondly, VPS customers need far more disk space, RAM, and CPU power than shared hosting.  The more infrastructure you have to maintain, the higher the complexity and administrative burden.   VPS customers usually demand higher availability too.",1215673688

FSF licenses just restrict the way I can release my derivative work.<p>At best the FSF license can be seen as an understandable restriction on freedom to preserve open source software by requiring reciprocation. To me there is no question that MIT and BSD licenses are more free. FSF style licenses made more sense when open source seemed like it might be a delicate beast at the mercy of proprietary forces, I think its clear now just how robust open source software is.",1215673611

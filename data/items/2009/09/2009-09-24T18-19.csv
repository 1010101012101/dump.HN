841800,comment,841570,841709,0,0,dasil003,,,"Yeah, Joel is definitely, definitely wrong about unit tests.  Not in the TDD/BDD/Agile koolaid kind of way, but in terms of ancillary tools, automated testing in general could only be second to version control for what it does to long term productivity.<p><i>the dangerous path you get on is ""always shipping"" without paying attention to what maintenance means</i><p>The Joel article glosses over this too much.  Why?  Because this is what the unwashed masses of programmer wannabes attempt to do all day every day.  You know these people, the ones that just have no business being programmers.  In other industries there are standards, credentials and transparent performance evaluations that prevent people like this from even getting hired.  Yet in the programming industry they make up a disturbing percentage of the work force.  That's one extreme--the most common one.<p>Joel is more focused on the architecture astronauts who need code to be a little too elegant.  I know first hand that these kinds of people can really damage your ability to ship a product if given too much control, but I think it's wrong to draw a distinction and favor a ""duct-tape programmer"".  First, because most of these people probably have the capacity to ship amazing stuff with a little guidance and the occasional reality check from more ""duct-tapey"" colleagues.  Second, because these guys push forward the state of the art.  They often see the big architecture picture in a way that others don't.  They may waste a lot of time by short-term metrics, but their work is the only kind that eventually leads to long-term dividends.  Occasionally some of them may be so obsessive compulsive that they just can't be forced to ship.  Fine, they should go get Ph.Ds and do great things in academia, but they're still infinitely more valuable than the people who don't even really grok programming.",1253816530

If a process crashes (why should it? - it communicates with outside world only via message-passing) it cannot corrupt or lock any shared data, etc. The whole class of problems which comes form a flawed concept of pthreads does not arise.<p>There is no &quot;reactive asynchronous event processing (written in Java or Scala)&quot;, there is no non-blocking I/O (btw, the only real non-blocking I/O could be done by an OS - aio_read/write and friends).

8713093,comment,8712879,8712879,0,0,Cushman,,,"If I understand the argument, the use of a set rather than a stack encodes the observation that the order of execution of adjacent partition operations isn&#x27;t important. That ordering is information you don&#x27;t have to store, meaning you can choose any set-like data structure, and being able to choose your access is theoretically useful: For example, by following a rule like &quot;partition the smallest interval first&quot;, you could keep the set size (&quot;depth&quot;) to a minimum. (That might be handy due to random pivot choice?) You don&#x27;t have the freedom to choose that in a stack-backed implementation, whether recursive or &quot;non&quot;.<p>So it is reasonable to argue this is a more abstract, &quot;fundamental&quot; implementation of the sort. Intuitively, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that different from &quot;remov[ing] the recursion, for example by making the stack explicit&quot;, then removing the stack, but it&#x27;s sure interesting.<p>Edit: See <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8713160"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8713160</a> for more context; this is correct, but the point is not really about how the code works.",1417977944

The vast majority of pull requests do contain something that is ultimately a positive addition, so a simple &quot;rejection&quot; is not appropriate.  Instead, in order to get a pull request to be presented in the way that the maintainer needs it to be, the request have to be slowly nursed over days/weeks/months, in a series of often dozens of back and forth emails, code samples, coachings, tutorings, attempting to get the PR submitter to please write correct tests, please get it to look a certain way, etc.   The contributors will frequently themselves not reply for <i>weeks</i> or <i>months</i> when these suggestions are made - pull requests that ultimately have something useful will languish just as much if the maintainer attempts to compel the contributor to finish the work of preparing the PR for a merge, as if the maintainer just took a long time to finish the PR themself.   It is <i>much less effort</i> and usually much more expedient for the maintainer to simply take the PR in its incomplete state and just fix it directly.  Very often the problem is involved enough that the maintainer needs to be involved in restructuring in any case, even with a very well written PR.<p>The reality of the pull request is that it is in the vast majority of cases a more verbose form of bug report or feature request.

I liked literature, albeit I lacked the maturity to truly appreciate it.  Later, I have tried to read the Comedy again and again, but besides the vivid imagery and Dante&#x27;s mastery of poetry, I have failed to see what value I could extract from it.  On the other hand, Giacomo Leopardi -- a literary geek, so to speak -- had some insights to share about human condition.<p>> Dante was a poetic genius that created an entire language from scratch and pushed it in incredible directions.<p>I agree with this, but this is something of interest mostly to Italians alone, isn&#x27;t it?",1417976216

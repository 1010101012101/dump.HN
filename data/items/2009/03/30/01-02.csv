Actually, it's a pedantic point.<p>The better point for tm to claim is most chaste women are moral, whereas the same cannot be said for unchaste women.  So, to guarantee a better chance of developing a relationship with a moral woman (i.e. more likely to not commit adultery and be temperate), we men should be chaste and look for chaste women.<p>This is probably what he intended anyways, since it makes more sense.",1238378315

538084,comment,537823,537823,0,0,floozyspeak,,,"7 out of 10 is good enough to establish a pattern, but you should really try and figure out who your 10 turks were demographically before walkin off into the sunset.<p>do some basic demographic questions if you can, and always try and avoid easily answer questions with turks because ultimately in the end they are on turk to make a buck, and they will blow thru scale questions and simple yes/nos faster than all get out to get paid.<p>the other thing i'd do is try to get some folks you know who use the tool, or if its for a broad audience get someone you know, a friend of a friend and test them to see how they stack up against your turk findings, video tape these sessions for the dev team so they can relive the awe of ""oh my frickin god"" when and if it occurs<p>overall turk is fine and your 7 of 10 is fine if its a broad range acceptance target like ""everyone searches"" or what not but if its really demographic specific you need to know that piece of data from the turks because odds are that 10 really represents up to 3 or 4 different demographics, which makes your 7 more like 2 or 3",1238377985

Its often easier just to buy a pack of paper made for the transfer purpose (such as <a href=""http://www.techniks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techniks.com/</a>) since you know it will work.<p>If you use ferric chloride really take heed to the part about staining clothing, seems to always end up ruining some clothing so make sure to wear crappy stuff.<p>There is also a problem doing them the way he has done... if you use pads that are filled (as they are there) it can be difficult to drill the holes if using through-hole components. The drill bit will walk, or just bend because its so thin... using pads with holes in the middle makes it much easier. If you have a bigger board it becomes really annoying, especially if you have ICs with a lot of pins... they wont line up well.",1238377723

Maybe I'm being pedantic, but if I need to search for the attribution by going to the developers blog or viewing the source code, I don't think that's enough.<p>This is beside the point, because I agree that the other forms /are/ attribution, but I don't consider the creative commons link a form of attribution at all.",1238375646

I mean, why should have? SUVs are so much more profitable right now!?!<p>And look at how the foreign automakers are eating their lunch.  The VOLT is about 7 years late, (the insight and the prius were released almost a decade ago).\nAnd Toyota/Honda are not the bankrupts ones.<p>Some things are simply long term business decisions.

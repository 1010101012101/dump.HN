4706731,comment,4706323,4706532,9,0,cgcardona,,,"Nice review. I've spent the last 6 weeks working on a Windows 8 app. I've been using a dell box and samsung tablet with visual studio and a wired mouse/wireless keyboard so I can speak first hand about what it's like to use the 'desktop' part of Windows 8 for serious work.<p><i>Disclaimer: I've been a web developer for 4 years and have used a Mac during that whole time. Before that the only experience I had with windows was a typing class in high school and casually using it at people's houses. I don't have a bunch of Windows experience. This was the first native windows app that I've ever created. Also I've been using a full blown copy of WIndows 8 which is different than WinRT. Any of the mentions of 'desktop' software below won't run on a WinRT device.</i><p>Truthfully I'm not entirely sold on the idea of having a full blown computer in a tablet. Sure if was convenient for me to travel with the tablet and then when I got to a desk just plug in a mouse and attach a wireless keyboard but something still seemed incorrect.<p>More than once I was showing a workmate some code and absentmindedly touched the screen which highlighted the code and rearranged the order or cut it to the clipboard. Granted I'll develop the muscle memory to deal with that issue over time but I thought it worth noting that my initial reaction to having a 'full' computer on a tablet was negative.<p>Though I agree with you 100% that there is more ""Windows"" in here than we've been led to believe. In fact I found that only when launching apps did I interact with the metro start screen. Other than that I could just alt+tab right past it. All of the apps that I was using (sans the app that I was actually developing) were 'desktop' apps: Internet Explorer 10, File Explorer, Visual Studio 2012, cigwin and Tortoise SVN.<p>FWIW I like the traditional desktop version of IE10 much better than the new metro version of IE10. Which version of IE10 do you prefer? Have you done any app development?<p>The app that we created was built on the HTML5/CSS3/Javascript stack.Just like a webapp you build the UI in HTML/CSS and wire it together with javascript. There's a suite of UI elements in the WinJS.UI namespace that you can quickly build the UI with. You can also access the hardware and the Windows Runtime from javascript APIs.<p>The development experience was a real eye opener. The high level take away is that all the talk over the past 5 years about HTML5 eventually being used to create applications that could rival their native counterparts is finally coming to fruition.<p>You can build a Windows 8 app in either the native or the web stack and they will have nearly 100% feature parity. I've been considering making the switch from being a web developer to being a native app developer recently because I've been feeling limited by the browser. I've just wanted to get deeper access to the hardware and the OS and windows 8 fulfils that need.<p>Unfortunately they completely mangle the DOM and inject insane amounts of useless markup and attribute/values which make the semantic web geek inside of you die a little each time the app compiles and runs.<p>A small example--in my code I had a button that was a child of a div. It was literally two lines of HTML. After the app 'built' I couldn't get an event listener that was listening for an event on the child button to fire.<p>I used the DOM inspector to check out what was happening and not only had the compiler injected about 20 lines of html around each of my elements complete with dozens of data-foo attributesit didn't even maintain the parent/child relationship from my markup! You can imagine how disconcerting it is to doubt that the core relationships of your markup aren't going to be maintained.<p>If you have time check out the app I helped created-Trulia for Windows 8: <a href=""http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/trulia-real-estate-homes-for/aaa2a256-90ca-4abd-938f-3788f598a235"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/trulia-real-estat...</a>",1351360581

Yes the snap solves the problem, however you can still only share to that snapped app. Maybe we'll see a change in the behaviour of the Share charm in a future update.<p>Another problem I've had with the Mail app (though this is Windows 8, so not sure if it's in RT as well) is that you can't just use the Mail/Calendar apps like how you'd use them on an iOS device, where you can just add your gmail as an accunt and then you have your calendars and email.

4706723,comment,4706103,4706543,4,0,jaredhansen,,,"I don't think this is true.  Elite institutions, in addition to whatever signaling value they provide, do add something significant to the educational experience, which you cannot get from a mail-based correspondence course: regular, in-person interaction with other students who were deemed by the institution to be bright enough to be admitted.<p>I'm speaking from personal experience here: I was homeschooled for K-12, and I went to an average college and a prestigious law school.  So I've had basically the full range of educational experiences across the continuum you're talking about, and I can tell you with certainty that there are significant differences completely unrelated to signaling.<p>Much of a quality education takes place outside the classroom, and may not be strictly required by the curriculum itself.  Whether online education, via greater interactivity relative to previous forms of delivery, can approximate this benefit is an open question -- but ""live"" education (in person or otherwise) provides benefits that are simply not available to an isolated reader of a static text.<p>The Good Will Hunting quote about Harvard is cute, but it's false.",1351360433

They have a large group that does work in this area, worth investigating.  You could also contact any of your local government officials to get them to put you in touch with the right people.  Getting the feedback of potential customers is going to give you the best information to scope the project.  Another suggestion is to peel back all the unnecessary layers and features.  Just think of the core value proposition after you chat with potential users and make sure you are really working toward MVP.

4706705,comment,4706103,4706657,8,0,mgkimsal,,,"Well... no, it doesn't <i>make you money</i>.  It means you pay out less in taxes.  There's no more income, just less outgo.<p>I've boiled down my programming-skills to people sometimes by saying ""I can use computers/web/IT to do one of two things: bring in more revenue, or reduce your operating expenses"".  That's pretty much what everything boils down to.<p>Accountants, almost by their definition, aren't going to be able to increase revenues.  They might increase profit by reducing outlays, or shifting money around to different tax years and such, but fundamentally accountancy activities aren't going to increase revenue.<p>Most IT projects don't increase revenues on their own either - it's generally in conjunction with initiatives from some other department.  But sometimes the increase in revenues that can be generated with strong IT/web initiatives is enormous.<p>However... most of us are focused on the 'saving money' aspect, similar to accountants.  We can optimize processes in an organization, increase auditability, generate more reports faster, etc.<p>EDIT: ""The same direct profitability cannot be said about programmers. At best it is indirect""  Ummm... just to be clear, yes it can.  If I do a project for someone that costs, say, $100k, but allows them to bring in, say, $3 million in extra revenue, it's a no-brainer.  The project increased revenue (and, well, it's a no-brainer to do if it increases profits).  But I may do the same project for $100k which allows a company to reduce its internal helpdesk needs from, say, 25 people down to 5 people, saving $400k per year.  That should generally be a no-brainer too.<p>It's pretty easy - I'd say often easier, to justify developer or software project cost/benefits/ROI vs an accountant's abilities, simply because the laws surrounding taxes are impossible for anyone to fully understand.  That huge tax deduction you got might come at the expense of an audit 3 years from now.  Even if you 'win', the cost of the audit needs to be factored in later.",1351360068

And most of that is SS, which caps at $106k or something. Couple this with the fact that self-employed folks have a variety of deductions that employees usually don't get (home office, special retirement options, lots of business expenses), and it starts to look a little more even.<p>It's true that you don't get paid time off, but I can tell you from experience that a decent and determined freelance programmer can easily make $10k / month and leave <i>plenty</i> of time for relaxation.<p>The biggest thing most self-employed folks have to deal with that they wouldn't normally is health insurance, but if you're young and healthy, decent insurance is a few hundred bucks a month, at most.

Dropbox or any rsync+rcs scheme will never destroy a file unless either one endpoint of the sync has truncated the file or there is a file system corruption. In the case of the former the rcs portion will take care of things, restore the pre-truncated file and have that sync'd around. In the case of a file system corruption Dropbox should be doing file integrity checks. For example some simple things that spring to mind, most file types b&w e built in signatures, header blocks, that validate the files extension type, if the file fails to ""look like"" the claimed extension type then don't sync it,  it flag it for user attention.<p>I do Dropbox manually, I rsync a list of folders to a linode instance running mercurial. It's simpler, scriptable, more flexible and as fail safe as Dropbox. If something does get corrupted its really simple to go back in the version history. I can't remember the last time I had a file system corruption with ext3, I suppose they still happen, but not to me in solid use for years. Obviously my mercurial repository is also backed up regularly.<p>I don't agree that a backup system has to be restore tested periodically, instead I believe that the restore process has to be an integral part of the workflow.

This is the reasoning behind what you've probably heard described as the ""loudness war"". 0dBFS is the reference point beyond which no signal can exceed.<p>Contrast that with analog audio, be it the DAC (digital-to-analog converter) on your soundcard that splits to a ""line out"" (likely 3.5mm a/k/a/ 1/8"" TRS connector outputting audio at -10 dBV, the ""consumer"" level) and ""headphone jack"" (i.e. line level signal -> headphone amplifier). Once the audio signal becomes analog, you must then be concerned about gain staging. If you have a crappy sound card, you shouldn't reduce the analog output, because, in order to achieve the same loudness, you will have to increase the gain on your 'speakers' (a/k/a/ ""pre-amplifier""; often integrated into cheap 'all in one' computer audio playback systems). Remember that the noise floor remains the same regardless of gain settings, so by reducing the ""line out"" level, you are only increasing the noise floor (i.e. level of noise).<p>For all of you geeks out there... If you are looking to cut through the bulls<i></i>t and get a quality playback system, look into a setup that has a quality DAC and/with monitor controller, a separate preamp, and quality monitors. Benchmark has a great USB DAC, and or Lavry Engineering is what the professional mastering studios use (their DAC costs well over $20k, and not because of crap like 'voodoo diamond dust covered gold-plated platinum wires', but, in part, because it has an internal oven and temperature monitoring circuitry to keep the internals at precise temperatures).

Should have known it was at least twice as much in equity since the proposal was that the founders would keep a majority of the shares.<p>$3 million input is less than half the value.   Ergo, a minimum of $6 million + valuation (without considering an option pool) means that 4% equity has a face value of at least $240,000.<p>Also, I am not certain that an S-corp allows for an 83(b) election in regards to stock options (talk to an accountant) and make shareholders (e.g. founders)  responsible for tax upon the increase in the value of their stock. It could result in a huge personal tax bill for the tax year in which funding occurred. Again, talk to an accountant.",1351357286

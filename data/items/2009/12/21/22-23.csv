1008803,comment,1008601,1008654,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's a lot more rational than rational than paroling an experienced criminal back into society without the most basic means of economic support.<p>While in prison, convicts typically work but the costs of their incarceration are set against their earnings, such that the amount they make is trivial, basically equivalent to pocket money for a child. Now while I don't think anyone should expect to go to prison for financial gain, society has an interest in motivating a convicted criminal to act within the law after their release. For petty and less serious crimes, providing some sort of economic incentive and organizational assistance following release from prison is probably more likely to reduce recidivism.<p>I mean, in prison you have a roof over your head and a few meals every day - your physical basic survival is assured. In the case described in the sermon, a newly-released prisoner is then put into a position of trying to reintegrate into society with the equivalent of about 2 days' pay at minimum wage, which is not at all adequate to ensure basic physical survival, especially in winter. No matter how sincere a prisoner's remorse and intention of reform, putting them into a drastically worse economic situation immediately after release massively increases the temptation to crime - either for its immediate gain, or as a deliberate strategy to get sent back to prison and the surety of a bed/ roof/ meal.",1261436378

Between Safari and Firefox, Firefox was dead on, while Safari randomly appeared to skew as it started playing from different points in the music, just enough to be significant.  I'd imagine it was some bug in counting sampling rate.  In the end I had to crack open the JPlayer code and force Flash all the time.<p>TL;DR Moral of the story?  It's hard to expect implementation to be perfect for a not-yet-finished standard, but until then, someone (you/me/us?) needs to make the equivalent of a community quirksmode combined with automatic bug submission to the relevant engine so we can get on with our lives.",1261434262

This could turn dense-urban areas into mesh networks very rapidly, with a maximum of 6 months till a dense network is developed.<p>Heck add a processor, ram and a SSD to the wi-fi device and you could sell your car network's processing power for use as a supercomputer for data crunching purposes.

6227532,comment,6220820,6225385,2,0,sirmarksalot,,,"This discussion sort of hinges on being able to explain why something is a bad practice or not. What problems in particular do exceptions cause, and in which situations do they not apply? In other words, is it ever <i>right</i> to throw an exception, or is every line of code in your program &quot;control flow?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s been nearly a decade since I&#x27;ve used plain C, so I&#x27;m not 100% sure, but I was under the impression that it doesn&#x27;t have any native support for exceptions. So yes, under those circumstances &quot;goto&quot; would definitely be appropriate.<p>In C#, you can implement resource ownership with the IDisposable interface and &quot;using&quot; keyword, which guarantees that once you leave the block (via an exception or regular control flow), the resource is cleaned up. In C++, you can use the RAII pattern that another commenter brought up. What other problems do exceptions introduce?<p>In my as-functional-as-is-practical programming philosophy, you throw an exception when there is no valid output for your function. Whether or not that&#x27;s recoverable is up to the client to decide. Nulls are an extremely poor substitute for this, as they push the responsibility of output validation onto the client, and every single line of code must be enclosed in an &quot;if (foo != null)&quot; block.<p>EDIT: Removed unproductive &quot;zinger&quot; at end.",1376697546

By &quot;suspicious&quot; I didn&#x27;t mean to imply bad intent, just my doubts that you could offer a fair (i.e. competitive) salary (any benefits, or is it BYOHealthInsurance?), and also that you were sufficiently well-capitalized to fund the business. Underestimating the necessary capital is one of the leading causes of startup failure. So if I were approached with an offer like this one, I would not be getting my hopes up until I heard some numbers, and I would be skeptical unless I saw a pretty thorough plan with budget and expected revenue. But that&#x27;s just me: I am fairly risk-averse.<p>Re &quot;final say&quot;: Ultimately if you&#x27;re business partners with someone you both need to be happy.

Still, if you were a client and not a business partner, and you were paying me on a fixed bid, I&#x27;d want a spec up front, not at the end. (If you were paying me hourly you can have all the revisions you want.) If we were potential partners, I&#x27;d be asking myself what the risks are if you prove difficult to work with--for instance, what am I giving up to join the venture?

Their success in mindshare made them popular in the server arena, but there are little things here and there where it falls behind. Making a server not based on an LTS version is one early trap to fall into (all debian versions are effectively LTS), but more importantly, debian is not fond of retrograde breakages. Ubuntu is much more of a moving target than debian - when you want to find out how to do something, it often changes between releases (one mildly common desktop task (which I can&#x27;t recall at the moment :/ ) had five different ways to do it over the past five releases...). There&#x27;s more unique stuff in ubuntu - like upstart, a core feature which no-one else uses - and that reduces your troubleshooting info pool. Ubuntu also has lots of automagic-helpery stuff, which is good for an end-user distro, but gets in the way a little on a server. One example is the &#x27;did you mean?&#x27; thing when you make a shell typo. That consumes time and is pointless on a server.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly familiar with CentOS.

Here&#x27;s an extract:<p>--------------------------------------<p>I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let&#x27;s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.<p>Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.<p>Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.<p>By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on &quot;How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.&quot; Worse yet, they&#x27;ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, &quot;If it can&#x27;t be done, why are there 215 of us?&quot;",1376696310

The strongest point Jobs made to Larry was that company should do only 5 things and do it very well (paraphrase). Larry took this to heart and realized Google was extremely fragmented with lots of small undirected efforts going no where. Rest is the history...

Even aside from any psychological power dynamic, it's a really good way to make sure you get to cover the things you want to cover.<p>If you've ever come out of an interview and said ""Oh man, hopefully that went good; but I wish they'd asked me to talk more about area 'X'."", you know it can be nerve-wracking.<p>Being able to have an actual conversation, where there's interplay between the interviewer and interviewee will do wonders for your anxiety level (which considering how stressful interviewing can be for some people, can be a big deal).",1329958533

I've read many of the articles and books on this topic and Spark still included new information for me.<p>After reading it I decided to finally get on a religious exercise schedule and I've been on it for two months. The improvements to my will-power, focus, and mood have been tremendous.<p>As a side note: one thing that has helped me keep up the 5 to 6 exercise sessions per week is reminding myself that I'm only exercising for cognitive and mood benefits. This helps me personally not get distracted by other factors like fat-loss, improving running times, etc. If I added other non-brain goals, then it'd be easy to get bummed out and discouraged if I didn't achieve them, so I keep my goals purely brain focused. If those other benefits happen as a result of the exercise, then great, but they are not why I'm doing it.",1329958502

It sucks.<p>I've never met someone ""like me"" but 20 years older, or 30, or 40. That would be incredible.

It's a question of availability and reliability. A company could start with one part of the process. It can gain trust and add more features. At the end there will be the whole package available. It should be possible for the client, though, to only use parts of the package, if they want to keep some independence.",1329955747
3623169,comment,3621371,3621861,1,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"I took ai-class as well and was actually really disappointed in Norvig's teaching style (considering I generally love what he writes).  I thought Thrun on the other hand was great, so I have a lot of hope for the udacity courses. My suspicion is that each instructor had different levels of commitment to the project, and since both are extremely busy this affected the presentation.<p>My biggest issue with ai-class was that in almost all the exams and homework there were quite a few very poorly phrased questions. In a human-graded exam/hw this isn't so bad since the ability to ""show your work"" usually allows you to misunderstand a question and demonstrate that you do understand the material.  In general I though very little effort was put into creating assignments that worked well for an online environment (ml-class did this perfectly).",1329955696

There are issues with migration if you're doing the latter, but not a big deal.<p>Do you have any contractual recourse against the chat provider?  Have you considered including such terms in future contracts with partners?<p>Do you have a security audit firm?  There's plenty of value to in-house audits, but some kind of independent audit is probably a reasonable choice.  You probably don't have PCI concerns (it's free, right?), but users might feel better about privacy otherwise.  Just the existence of an account for a given user is probably an issue for some people, so even foolish things like using the same <i>username</i> on a porn site as on other sites could be a leak -- being able to verify that myhusbandinvirginiasportsfan is a valid user account on youtube would potentially make a divorce attorney very happy.<p>Would you answer general questions about the site/business, too?  The whole porn tube thing seems like a big change in the industry (I was at SHOT Show in Vegas a few weeks ago, and stopped by the concurrent AVN event -- they really hate the tubes).  I'm especially curious how you feel about the meta-tube sites (e.g. fantasti.cc) which seem to blatantly scrape youporn (and other tube) content.

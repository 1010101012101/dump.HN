Then I sell it, usually for around $1000. Sometimes I take a loss, sometimes I make some money, it's a wash.<p>But when in I am in town for less than a few weeks, I rent. Always with Enterprise. Never on airport. In fact, I've taken hours of busses from the airport to save $100 on a rental.<p>I think it's easy. I go in, I sign a few times, we walk around the car and I leave. Done.<p>Getaround is cute but its too expensive, Flightcar sounds nice, but it amplifies all the problems that Getaround has.<p>Meh.",1353848355

4828044,comment,4827977,4827977,3,0,gexla,,,"If the schools suck, then don't bother with college.<p>If you are horrible in school, then don't waste your time and money.<p>If you have a burning desire to do start a business (other than freelancing) or to travel, etc, then skip college.<p>If you believe that you want to be a developer / designer in the future but not so sure about details beyond that, then college might be good.<p>The great thing about college is that it's a good environment for discovery and being around a lot of other people at the same stage of life as you are. It's also a good environment for learning from others, bouncing ideas off each other and experimenting with starting businesses with your peers. Who knows, maybe something shows promise and you can drop out. ;)<p>Keep your freelancing to a minimum because after those first couple of years or so, you can get to a point where you aren't learning nearly as much as you could while working on your own stuff. With freelancing, you get paid for what you know. With side projects, you can greatly expand what you know. Since college is generally a time where your living expenses are relatively cheap, this is a great time to focus on side projects rather than spending all your time on freelancing.<p>Keep in mind that programming skills are most valuable when they can be combined with deep knowledge of other domains. Most developers, especially those who are self-taught, know programming well, but not much else at a similar level of understanding. Consider topics such as statistics or other engineering / science fields. Get internships in areas which aren't programming. This will make you more valuable and will also give you a leg up on your ability to break into niche areas which don't have a lot of competition in delivering services if you ever decide to start a business.<p>Personally, I did horrible in school and freelancing ended up devouring me. So, I dropped out, stuck with freelancing and eventually moved abroad.",1353848228

What about the innocent familys who have been brutally killed.. The women who have.been raped.. The children who have been sliced up..! Your enemy's were the Taliban not innocent harmful familys.

Neither one of them is an example of responsible online behaviour either and I'm not one bit surprised that trouble came of it. The world we live in today is hair trigger about stuff like this and it has nothing to do with free speech. It's simply because a lot of people are very nervous and would rather err on the side of caution and jail a few innocents than they would take a chance and be left holding the bag if things turned out bad.<p>If you don't take that into account when you act then you can go around and blame the system, but that's like blaming the weather for being rained upon.<p>Personally I think the authorities (on both sides of the pond) should just investigate to send the message that there is some oversight but it should never make it to prosecution.

4828031,comment,4826561,4827911,7,0,georgeorwell,,,"I'm not a radical feminist in the sense of ""intercourse is rape"" but hmmm... I think I have body modification phobia - so that would include women getting breast implants - and also exhibitionist phobia and also pull-the-wool-over-your-eyes phobia.  (Although quite frankly, I wasn't fooled for long just based on the extremely masculine technical writing.  I have never read anything that a woman wrote that looks remotely like that.  Sorry.)<p>If the article had been open about scanlime's transexuality it wouldn't have irritated me nearly as much, but my interpretation was that it was (unconsciously, perhaps) designed to validate that she really is a woman.  No, you cannot actually change sex, modulo some crazy gene therapy.<p>I know I was kind of unfair in my original comment.  I think it was really me whinging that the HN crowd wouldn't be gushing like this if they all knew that scanlime was trans, and then me also getting annoyed at my guess that scanlime was complicit in this.  I feel like I need to say sorry.  Sorry.  But I'm about to undo my apology :/<p>In general, I get really annoyed by queer people making a point about their sexuality (e.g. gay men who lisp), and in my mind this article counts as such.  They annoy me as much as frat boys and drunk girls in skimpy clothes and people wearing leather collars.  I basically think our society is hypersexualized and that this is bad.<p>I don't know if trans women are objectifying women merely by existing.  Most men do this, so it's highly likely.  My most heinous viewpoint is that queer/fetish sexuality is likely to be some kind of psychological defense mechanism against childhood trauma, and while good and perfectly acceptable if it works and life is functional, it's important to keep the source of it in mind.  Oh and finally I'm very likely not a radical feminist because I don't believe in equality between men and women but rather a kind of complementarity.  (Yes, universal suffrage is good, and woman should be allowed to have jobs, etc.)",1353847369

4827990,comment,4827319,4827553,4,0,galadriel,,,"From my experience of college level instrumentation design, if one want to design parts and run CNC to its full potential, he/she should be decently proficient in curve drawing, understanding gear design, etc, and the math required for it can be quite involved. This is after you know the broad design detail. Some difficult things involve how to best approximate a curve on given CNC constraints, figuring out best fit for parts, etc; and then write appropriate programs for it. IMO, there are only a very few people who would have skill set like these, but not enough to move on to higher level engineering jobs.<p>Although, a lot of this thing is getting automated, and there is a huge push towards figuring out how you can feed a CAD design directly to CNC and let it figure out best way to implement it.<p>PS: I cannot expect that you can ever hire enough good people in this category for $10 an hour.

4827980,comment,4827319,4827319,41,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article: ""The secret behind this skills gap is that its not a skills gap at all. I spoke to several other factory managers who also confessed that they had a hard time recruiting in-demand workers for $10-an-hour jobs. 'Its hard not to break out laughing,' says Mark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center, referring to manufacturers complaining about the shortage of skilled workers. 'If theres a skill shortage, there has to be rises in wages,' he says. 'Its basic economics.'""<p>Agreed. That is the basic problem. If a worker can produce hundreds of widgets a day after specialized training with new computer-controlled machinery, but the worker could make just as much money per hour right after high school flipping hamburgers at the local fast-food restaurant, there is no reason for the worker to go through two years or more of specialized training, especially at the worker's own expense.<p>Much of the rest of the article discusses the overall rationality of workers seeking jobs that they can obtain with the least investment of their own time in training for a given income. Of course. Part of the problem is that if companies hire on the basis of course completion certificates rather than on the basis of demonstrated competence, they will miss out on good workers, and yet hire some lousy workers, and thus be reluctant to offer competitive starting wages. (It's expensive to hire a worker who can't do the job, and it's also expensive to let go workers who don't learn on the job and to hire their replacements.)<p>In what I think has become my best-liked comment on HN, I've collected references other participants here helped me find about company hiring procedures. Companies need to hire on the basis of actually being able to do the job, not on the basis of what classes workers have attended. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes. If the job you are hiring for involves use of a computer-controlled machine tool, have the candidate put the machine to use making sample parts (advertise the job in a way that makes clear a work-sample test is required, to screen out people who have no clue how to operate such machines). Hire the able, and pay them what they are worth.<p>Ask yourself about any hiring process you have ever been in, as boss or as applicant: did the applicant have to do a work-sample test based on actual work results expected in the company? Why not?",1353846125

I still don't know what I want to do in the future full-time, because although programming comes to me more naturally, I enjoy designing stuff a lot ( and I'm actually not rubbish at it ). On top of this, I have realised that my goal is to eventually step away from client work and develop my own products / become an entrepreneur<p>At the moment I'm considering university, but I'm 99% sure it's not going to help me a lot in the future since I learn programming better on my own ( and on top of that, a CS degree might not make that much sense since I want to become a developer and not an engineer ), and most business degrees are rubbish ( many people such as Paul Graham have said that basically entrepreneurship is something you learn as you go ), so that leaves me with design courses ( my main interest would be interactive design, so again, not sure how much a typical graphic design degree would help me ).<p>Despite all this, my plan is to choose a design course ( by the way, I'm from Eastern Europe, not US ) which isn't that intensive and would allow me to work a lot on my ideas in the free time, while still having the perks of college: a lot of fun, making connections, parties, etc.<p>Is this a good idea, or am I going about this the wrong way? Could a degree actually make sense, should I continue freelancing or should I just pack my bags and move to Sillicon Valley? What's the best thing to do under these circumstances?<p>Thanks HN, I'm really looking forward to your answers.",1353846052

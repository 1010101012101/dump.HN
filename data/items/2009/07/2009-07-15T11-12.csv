To some it may be beneficial, but to others not so. Sure the group that benefits may be in the majority, but to ignore the minority group and declare that to ""society"" the outcome was good is to ignore the different views and interests that make up a society.",1247657497

They have repaired much larger programs (most referenced here are unix utilities) using many more (100s) of positive test cases. As someone who is in a position to know a bit about their work, I find it very exciting.<p>As some comments seem to have slightly misinterpreted the work, I'd like to clarify that the genetic algorithm does not find undocumented bugs. One needs, at minimum, a negative test case and some number of positive cases to begin the repair process. While the ga's fitness function attempts to ensure that no new bugs are introduced, this is of course impossible to establish with certainty. As the number of available and independent positive test cases increases, the repair becomes increasingly robust.",1247656503

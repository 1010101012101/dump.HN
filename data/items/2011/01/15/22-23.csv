2108046,comment,2107929,2107929,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Compare Apple's impact to openness online to Microsoft's back in early 2000.  There were a lot of banking and corporate websites that only worked with IE and Active-X.   As a result, every corporate machine (and many users of these banking sites) - had to have a copy of IE floating around to fully access the Internet - and good portions of the internet just weren't usable for many Linux/BSD users.<p>Now - how much of the Mobile Internet requires that you use an Apple product?  Apple just doesn't have enough market dominance to result in more than a trivial portion of the Mobile Internet to be written _specifically_ for Safari/IOS Browers.<p>Wales is completely off his rocker here.  As long as Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and yes, IE, continue to have a strong presence as browsers (and I don't see that changing anytime soon), and as long as Anddroid, WP7, and others start rolling out first class smart phones, Apple will not be a threat to the Mobile Internet.<p>This is one of those cases where lack of a market leader actually results in a better adherence to standards.  As long as the focus is ""Build an ACID3 Compliance Browser"" for the vendors, and developers write ""ACID3 Compliant Websites"" - we'll be in fine shape (modulo the recent Video controversy)",1295132125

2108039,comment,2107745,2107745,0,0,jdietrich,,,"A lot of people are of the opinion that you can pick up a new language very quickly, but I disagree strongly. Being able to formulate a basic program is easy, learning to be fast and efficient and effective is another matter entirely.<p>Personally, I'd pare that schedule right down. If you don't <i>need</i> a specific language, I'd start by learning the basics with Python. It's clear, readable, comes with a brilliant standard library, is very useful for all sorts of things and is a fairly 'normal' high-level language - what you learn in Python will be very broadly applicable.<p>Once you can competently write software in Python, the logical and inevitable next language is JavaScript, which is as useful as it is ugly. It's a terrible first language, but it's a brilliant second one, mainly because it's so useful. Obviously there's client-side web stuff, but also servers with node.js, smartphone apps with Appcelerator Titanium, Chrome plugins and a whole variety of other stuff. Javascript is very similar indeed to ActionScript, so you should find it fairly easy to pick up Flash and Air, giving you the opportunity to do all sorts of rich web stuff, develop multi-platform apps with Air or develop for the upcoming Blackberry Playbook.<p>You'll pick up HTML and SQL by default and while it's worth having a book or two on standby, you'll probably find yourself learning what you need as you need it.<p>As regards books:\n<a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/</a><p>There is no good introductory text on JavaScript, but try:\n<a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748/</a>\n<a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101992/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101992/</a><p>Now go out and build something.",1295131854

When you get so accustomed to HN, an option to change something such as the top banner color is truly a life changer! What's great is that easter eggs are pretty easy to implement (I'd assume), but they add to the excitement and are something to look forward to for users.<p>Obviously, adding more easter eggs is not a priority. But it would be very cool if pg did add a few more when he got around to it.<p>Here are some of my ideas (features would be unlocked at different karma thresholds):<p><pre><code>   -Change font and size/color\n   -Change number of posts per page\n   -Use official tl;dr in a comment (would appear in a area separated \n    from the comment)\n   -Use certain formatting in comments (e.g. <hr>, <b>, <u)\n   -View statistics of how long you've been using HN in the past\n    24 hours\n   -Message other users\n   -View graphs of polls\n   -Down-vote posts (not just comments)\n   -Sort and filter posts or comments using different metrics\n   -Track certain comments (yours or others) and see when people\n    respond to them\n   -Choose to only show top comments on a certain thread\n</code></pre>\nNow that I've written them, it seems as if some are not as 'small' as I had expected.

Minecraft is not seriously competing with AAA big-budget titles like God of War.  They have completely different audiences.  Yes, GoW is extraordinarily expensive to create, but it offers a gameplay experience that Minecraft doesn't and never will.  Or at least, by the time minecraft can procedurally generate an experience like GoW, the big-budget AAA franchises will have moved on to something flashier.<p>And certain franchise titles are attractive because of the licensing, eg the NFL.

Answer: the fact that they are good there <i>relative to our prior expectations</i>. Where do those expectations come from? From looking at ourselves. Similarly: what determines where we say we're ""weak""? Answer: seeing other things being strong relative to us. Computers, for instance.<p>Now, of course there are other points of reference for deciding where we're ""weak"". Doesn't that invalidate my argument? Why, no, because actually if we use those other points of reference the paradox rather goes away. For instance: Computers do arithmetic very, very fast. Is that an area where we're weak? Only if we compare ourselves against computers; we do arithmetic much better than chickens or tigers do.",1295131024

What if instead of human versus machine\n   we played as partners? My brainchild saw the light of day in a match in 1998 \n   in León, Spain, and we called it “Advanced Chess.” Each player had a PC at hand \n   running the chess software of his choice during the game. The idea was to \n   create the highest level of chess ever played, a synthesis of the best of man \n   and machine.\n\n   ....\n\n   In 2005, the online chess-playing site Playchess.com hosted what it called a \n   “freestyle” chess tournament in which anyone could compete in teams with other \n   players or computers. Normally, “anti-cheating” algorithms are employed by \n   online sites to prevent, or at least discourage, players from cheating with \n   computer assistance. (I wonder if these detection algorithms, which employ \n   diagnostic analysis of moves and calculate probabilities, are any less \n   “intelligent” than the playing programs they detect.)\n\n   Lured by the substantial prize money, several groups of strong grandmasters \n   working with several computers at the same time entered the competition. At \n   first, the results seemed predictable. The teams of human plus machine \n   dominated even the strongest computers. The chess machine Hydra, which is a \n   chess-specific supercomputer like Deep Blue, was no match for a strong human \n   player using a relatively weak laptop. Human strategic guidance combined with \n   the tactical acuity of a computer was overwhelming.\n\n   The surprise came at the conclusion of the event. The winner was revealed to be \n   not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American \n   chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at \n   manipulating and “coaching” their computers to look very deeply into positions\n    effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster \n   opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human \n   + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more \n   remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</code></pre>",1295129649

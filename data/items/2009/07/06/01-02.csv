688976,comment,688905,688905,0,0,jerf,,,"While I'm not sure I can disagree with the conclusion, I disagree with the arguments leading up to it. Some of the most interesting progress I see today is occurring in the field of computer vision, and the reason why it is occurring today and not 15 years ago is because 15 years ago, you had a Pentium/MMX 133 with 16 MB of RAM. All of the algorithms that today run in just-barely-real time, or run in batch mode on a timeframe that a single grad student can do many compile-run-analyze-try something else cycles on per day, would have taken weeks on that hardware.<p>I think general AI will see some stuff like this too, algorithms that could have been conceived of 20, 30, 40 years ago but couldn't be feasibly run on even a supercomputer of the time, that run fairly comfortably in a modern <$1000 laptop at Best Buy. (And of course runs even better in a dedicated server performance box; my point is that even low-grade consumer hardware is pretty damn amazing nowadays.)<p>When I took a grad-level evolutionary computation course about eight years ago, one of the two professors related a story about one of his earliest runs of an evolutionary algorithm. He literally carried around a stack of punchcards as he moved between several schools, and set up the computation so that he could run it for a few hours as there was time, then suspend it again. It literally took him years. This same computation of course runs in a few seconds on something as powerful as an iPhone. (Which isn't too dissimilar in spec from the laptop I used in that class, an 800 MHz Duron PoC (even at the time, admittedly) which was proud to have 256MB of RAM, IIRC.)<p>It's not just the raw speed of the algorithms, it's the speed of the analysis loop. Where computation time once dominated the research of even the best minds, soon the best minds of our generation will actually be able to get feedback about their AI explorations on reasonable time scales. The fat lady has not sung yet.<p>(This still explains a lot in the non-AI cases too. It took a while before garbage collection was not a big performance hit, then it took a while longer for popular languages to pick it up. It was never <i>forgotten</i>, it's just that there is often a larger gap between ""a good idea"" and ""a good implementation"" than ideas-people realize. Clearly, UNIX is old and out-of-date, but creating an entire ecosystem that is clearly superior and also <i>ready to go</i> is not something you hand to a grad student to write a thesis on. And so on.)",1246845456

It is my own experience that they are very distinctly different<p>Who cares?  Really?  People use these drugs because they give you super focus, both the feeling, and the reality.  You're too concerned about the mechanism rather than the effect.<p>> The very fact that they are achieved in humans without use of stimulants should be a strong indication that the stimulants do not recreate the same effect.<p>That makes no sense at all.  Sleep is natural, it doesn't follow that any pill which also induces sleep is not doing it via the same mechanism.  In fact, it's an indication of nothing, either way.<p>> Lack of focus is not due to deficiency of Ritalin.<p>No one claimed it was.  You're ignoring the desire for superhuman focus.  People take these when they want more focus than is natural.<p>> That people believe (as you do) that these drugs merely enhance existing brain function is a sign that people really aren't aware of what they are doing.<p>That people such as you are so strongly opposed is a sign that you're not objective about the issue and you assume others don't know the risks and if you could just educate them they'd change their behavior; you'd be wrong.<p>People willingly take far worse and far less safe drugs off the street just to get high.  Those who use prescription drugs like Ritalin off label to enhance work or study performance are not the people you need to be concerned with.  Drug use is not drug abuse.",1246845313

He could pretty much read any word, but we'd crack a book, he'd point at the word, say it, then continue to the next word. Punctuation meant nothing. He could have probably done it for days. Part of my job was to stop him and ask him questions about what was going on. Blank stares. I moved and couldn't tutor him any longer, but I don't think I helped, which was frustrating. The thing is, he had been in the program for years.

And since we're strictly talking about ""freemium,"" that implies a for-pay option.

I can strongly recommend any version of ""Rocket Propulsion Elements: And Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets"" Knowing calculus when you read it is helpful but not essential.<p>That said, rocket engine design is a tradeoff between how much energy you generate in the combustion chamber and your ability to direct the resulting hot gas in the direction you want it to go. Highly temperature resistant materials like ceramics can take a lot of heat, but they don't have a lot of tensile strength, things like metals which are very tough generally become weaker the hotter they get. Combined with the fact that combustion chamber shape determines how the gases will burn, and you find yourself trying to design something that is very durable, can withstand significant pressure, and can take a lot of heat. Model rocket engines basically consume themselves as they burn being their own combustion chamber, but liquid or gaseous fueled rockets have to deal with the heat. The kicker is that if you don't get enough energy in the combustion chamber, you can't generate enough thrust to counteract the force of gravity so you can't even get off the ground.<p>The Space Shuttle's engines use tubing that runs through the engine 'bells' that cryogenic liquid runs through prior to being burned as fuel. This keeps them cool enough to contain the engine burn without melting or losing structural stability. That isn't something someone can build on a 'whim'.<p>This guy made something similar using a 3D printing process on metals. Assuming that the metal's tensile strength is sufficient post printing, this sidesteps a huge barrier to amateurs making liquid/gaseous fueled engines.",1357371130

I don't rightly recall if Google just had all of the distributed jobs, GWS, etc. run chroot or if some of them just had LD_LIBRARY_PATH not include the usual system directories.  (I hope most things were run chroot.)  The path to libc definitely contained a directory numbered for the release.  That way, the OS of the servers could be updated independently of the libraries used to run GWS, the indexing system, etc.  This helped reduce risk and testing effort when upgrading things.<p>Some third parties compiled libraries for us, against our setup.  When one of the versions of the system libraries was about to be removed from all of the servers, I remember editing the RPATH in the ELF headers of a third party library to make everything keep linking properly. (Edit: ... and without needing to ask them to recompile everything for us.)<p>Anyway, it most certainly is possible (and often desirable) to have one set of libraries for the OS and all vendor-supplied binaries and a different set of libraries (including libc) for all of the code you write.  Of course, Google has a lot more resources for this sort of thing, but it's not difficult to set up a chroot environment for your computations, or at least modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH.",1357371069

Basically I use:<p><pre><code>    dokuwiki | dokutexit | sed (cleanup) | pdflatex\n</code></pre>\nDokuWiki is a file-system based wiki which I run on localhost. Each section is one .txt file. To generate the book I made a master file which includes all necessary sections. The plugin dokutexit then produces the .tex output. Dokutexit does a good job, but I still there is some cleanup necessary (via sed). I also do some manual touchups by adding the front matter / back matter stuff (via \input{subfile.tex}) and then pdflatex does its magic.<p>The latex document class is extbook -- the regular book class does not have the 9pt option.<p>@READERS Sorry for inflicting upon you the 9pt font. I know it is tiny, but look at how small and portable the book is now ;)<p>____<p>I am still researching how to generate .epub and .mobi form latex files. If anyone has pointers to articles which discuss this, I would be very interested to hear. PM me, or post them here so that everyone can learn. (plasTeX? MathJax? MathML?)",1357369876
5011970,comment,5011913,5011913,1,0,milesokeefe,,,"I regret adding to the pile of negativity, but here's some suggests on how to improve it:<p>1. Either scale the page so that it doesn't take up enough space for a scroll bar to appear, or make it so that the photo gallery does not override scrolling. As it currently is, it is a troublesome user experience because I want to scroll down to see the rest of the page but sometimes my action causes the photo gallery to change.<p>2. Use different music for the video, as at least for me it is currently synonymous with Treehouse, so it doesn't make your brand as distinct.<p>3. Make the padding and margins on elements more consistent(the welcome page has no margin on the top, but lots on the bottom ), and add more in places(such as the index page).<p>4. Make a place for the footer. As it is, it appears half hazardously placed and not thought about or deliberate. I would suggest centering (in relation to the entire page) below the rest of the content.<p>5. A few fixes on the page you get sent to just after logging in and selecting an FB album:\n    #loading should be position:fixed, not position:absolute;\n    The loading gif should have a transparent background. Getting one that looks good can be hard but it's worth the effort.\n    It's probably an error with my specific account, but the loading screen is all I see when I go to the app after logging in and selecting the album ""Profile Pictures"" on my Facebook, which is composed of 4 images. It never gets past the loading page, even after refersh.<p>6. Re-do the video. It looks more like a family vacation slideshow rather than a presentation for a website. It should have little to no photo effects, and display images in the context of your website. A good chunk of the video is just pictures with animation or effects.",1357369848

5011966,comment,5004483,5004483,1,0,azharcs,,," IMO, its an extremely average redesign.<p>Major problem is responsive design, its not scalable for content heavy sites. Same code scaling for different screens, makes sense in theory but is nightmare in practice. I've been part of couple of projects where-in we learnt the hard way. Hence, you don't see any big site use responsive design in major way. Almost all sites (Facebook, Amazon, Flipkart) go with a different sites for mobile & desktop.<p>Also the use of white text on dark background is extremely hard to read. Hence you see pretty much every content-rich site uses white or light background with dark/grey text. An exception might be Myspace which went with dark background approach and failed miserably in engagement.<p>When using any site, we like consistency. By incorporating panels which open up from both left and right side, it provides an inconsistent feel while using the site. My usage might be completely different from yours. It is important to keep the overall layout consistent with content personalized based on users needs.",1357369673

Generally such clubs are great resources for understanding the regulations and if pursuing things professionally the requisite licensing. I was related a story about how the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) stopped one team from launching because they had used a solar tracker attached to steerable fins to keep the rocket on track, the story went that once you had it tracking a heat signature with steerable fins it went from being a model rocket to a munition. I can't vouch for accuracy of the story but the teller was someone I respect and is quite an enthusiast so I give it a good chance of being basically true.<p>So generally one considers the various elements of creating a rocket propelled munition and if you got too close to describing how someone could build one, I would not be surprised in the least if that person was approached by the BATF or the FBI asking you to limit what you publish. Or approached by people seeking to build such a device from 'scratch.'<p>Even doing something as simple as hobby robotics I've had folks email me out of the blue on how to create a circuit that would let you activate a switch remotely but was hard to jam. It can conceivably be used for robotics sure, it can also be used for ill. I generally point people to Horowitz and Hill's Art of Electronics and tell them its all in there (which it is, but you have learn it to use it) but perhaps out of a surplus of caution I don't design such things for folks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/amateur-rocketeers-reach-for-the-stars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/amateur-rocketeers-reach...</a>",1357369421

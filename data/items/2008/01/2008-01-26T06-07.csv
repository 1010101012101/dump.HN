That would be so annoying!<p>The only difference from a regular boring alarm clock to Sleep.FM's Social Alarm Clock, is the tone that wakes you.  You set the clock and when it goes off your alarm message(s) is the tone that wakes you.  Whether it's Happy Birthday, wake up old lady dont forget to take your medicine, the meeting has moved to a different location, good morning girlfriend/boyfriend/best friend i wanted to share this new song with you( you hear it), hey X i'll  meet you for breakfast at denny's before work, im sorry i wont be in the carpool today, dont take i95 huge traffic jam, it's snowing go back to bed, etc, etc....<p>I wonder rms did you happen to view a promo vid of ours?

It's easier with the help, so that's been good.<p>I want to add a ranking to the outgoing links, like a number by each link  that's how many times it's been clicked. Anyone have any tips on how to proceed?",1201328667

You had the moral high ground (defending a guy for taking a chance on an idea), and then you squandered it by jumping the shark and insulting everyone on YC News, all of our ideas/projects/skills, and then to top it off, throwing down a completely random gauntlet to pg himself, as if he had anything to do with any of this.<p>I suggest you close the browser and chill out a bit. No flame war is ever worth sounding that crazy.<p>(PS. I still didn't mod you down, but only because I stick by my '-1 is enough bad karma' rule.)",1201328121

104541,comment,104253,104253,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Kraus also gave the following story about the beta in a public forum: JotSpot signed up over 3,000 people for the beta and let it run for more than nine months.<p>Every Beta user had free access to the application and the developers were happy because they were getting a lot of testing. When it came time to convert to paid they had an extremely low yield (either less than 2% or less than 0.5% I can't remember) and they had to re-tool completely to figure out how to find paying customers. They ultimately revamped their signup process so that you had to give a credit card to start your 15 day free trial: this cut way down on their trails but boosted their conversion rate significantly and allowed them to focus on what kind of trial users converted at the high frequency.<p>Steve Blank makes a related point in ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"" when he cautions startup teams to distinguish between beta for product development and customer development. You need to test your product, but you also need to test your product conceptXwill people pay for it, how many people and how much will they pay. He observes that many startups fail because they can't find a market, few fail because they can't get their product to function.<p>Beta for test and beta for market exploration have two different goals. The number of early product testers you need may be two or three orders of magnitude less than the number you need to refine your product concept to the point you find market acceptance.",1201327665

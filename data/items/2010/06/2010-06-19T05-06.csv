Having said that, this guy's my new hero.<p>He sounds like he's more Burt Rutan than Richard Branson and the fact that he's seen through an end-to-end design for launch vehicles is pretty mind blowing.<p>If you look through the photos on his site it kind of has the feel of a boutique bike factory - say Cannondale in the early days - but then you see pictures of them 'spin forming titanium' or something equally exotic. Pretty cool stuff.",1276927132

Where is the moral outrage and street rallies from the moderates? Oh, I know... laying low cause they'll get shot. There a bunch of brave Iranians though, good luck to them.

Even fairly successful outcomes in the start-up world, such as Mint.com to take a random example, don't make founders that rich.<p>I suspect if you look at the new inclusions in Forbes 400 list over the past 10 years, that list (of deltas) would be dominated by Finance. This is not a good thing.""<p>pg replied:<p>""Instead of assuming this, why don't you check and tell us? It should be pretty easy; historical Forbes 400 data is available online.""<p>I decided to go check and tell everyone, and Paul Graham is wrong about the Forbes 400 showing startups having a higher return than Wall Street. According to the Forbes 400 data, between 1999 and 2009:<p>- 211 new people entered the Forbes 400 list during this ten-year period.<p>- Of these, 59 were from finance.<p>- 17 were from technology.<p>I think the record speaks for itself.<p>You can see the raw data at http://www.forbes.com/lists/home.jhtml?passListId=54&passYear=1999&passListType=Person, http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/54/rich-list-09_The-400-Richest-Americans_FinalWorth.html.",1276926634

DrudgeReport and Craigslist seem to be getting on ok, but I personally would use okcupid.com over plentyoffish.com because the design is so kick-ass.

On the other hand, scan the material into inDesign, clean it up, typeset it appropriately, and then export <i>that</i> to PDF. This is the way to beautiful PDF typography and it's an area where the PDF format really shines. (And this is coming from a guy who hates PDFs as a rule.)",1276924856

I linked to the meemoo demo above and I did like that one, even though it does have tons of bugs.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is this: A <i>good</i>, reusable component-graph interface is a very strong pull for all those people who care about that part without being particularly interested in the server behind it. It could make your kickstarter that much more effective to make it clear that it&#x27;s about making it simple to write your own engine implementation.<p>Screw your stretch goals* - the 250k level should be you providing a good-as-apple-pie API/documentation/support that others can write implementations for/with. Instead making it about particular implementations - Android, iOS, Python - smells a little like marketing speak. If you really believe in FBD, all you have to do is make it very simple for people to pick up the threads. You&#x27;d have tons of implementations in no time.<p>*Also: I don&#x27;t get the stretch goals in general. I get what you try to achieve with them, but you need to look at them form a programmers perspective: What if I&#x27;m a Python programmer who wants NoFlow? Do I have to call all the people I know who care about Android or iOS so I can get to my $1M level? That&#x27;s not going to happen. Likewise, Android devs won&#x27;t really care about pushing it further once their level is achieved, likewise for iOS. It&#x27;s a bit confusing.",1376315496
6199150,comment,6196334,6196759,1,0,lmm,,,">It really is odd how when philosophy is explicitly brought up, it is generally labeled as a useless endeavor, yet in most other discussions you see philosophical questions being raised all the time with the intention of using them as &#x27;appeals to ambiguousness&#x27;, when (as you mentioned) most of these questions have already been asked and thoroughly answered by philosophers ages ago. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong in not knowing about this, but clearly there&#x27;s an interest to know these types of answers that arises organically, which makes the dismissal of philosophy an ultimately misguided exercise in cognitive dissonance.<p>Do you have examples? As a scientist I&#x27;m inclined to see science as the true heir to ancient philosophy, and the part that still calls itself &quot;philosophy&quot; as, well, an inferior branch. When I spoke to philosophy students at university they seemed to study a really weird mix of things - about 1/3 history, 1/3 mathematical logic but covered less formally (which was intensely irritating when we shared lecturers because if there&#x27;s one field where you really need to be formal it&#x27;s mathematical logic), and 1/3 these very... abstract arguments that felt like they might say something interesting if any of the terms they used were defined rigorously and the arguments were written out symbolically, with small pieces of what should be  science thrown in almost at random, but it was missing the desire to connect all this up and actually perform experiments to see what was right.",1376315489

Completely separate products sharing only a kernel. And Windows Phone 8 doesn&#x27;t even share the kernel.<p>FFOS brings three things to the table that noone else has and they are:<p>1. Price. They are dirt cheap. Most people out there can&#x27;t afford to throw out what $600-800 on a handset. The only thing that is keeping these phones afloat is the telco contract that is subsidising the handset cost. Apart from the US, the rest of the world is pretty much handset and/or phone i.e. you can choose. I ALWAYS buy non locked handsets in cash and use cheap contracts. This is almost standard in Europe and the East. The only way paid up handsets can go is down and that&#x27;s going to simply fuck up the market for high end devices. Giffgaff in the UK is demonstrating that - people are paying virtually nothing and buying cheaper WinPhone (620 is cheap!!) and budget Android handsets these days.<p>2. HTML. Yes HTML+JavaScript. Every monkey can knock out apps for these, much like you could with MIDP2 / J2ME. You don&#x27;t have to be an expert on reference counting in Objective-C (iOS), navigate thousands of pages of SDK documentation (Android/WinPhone) or have to own a Mac to push apps out (iOS). You also don&#x27;t have to subscribe to some massive store model and subscription development model (WinPhone/iOS). Just a second hand laptop ($100-200) text editor ($0) and a cheap ($79) handset and you&#x27;re throwing out apps.<p>3. Reuse. A lot of apps can easily be repurposed for this development model. They can also be upscaled to web sites as well.<p>Hell, this is the scariest thing out there: cheap, easy with the potential to reuse stuff out there.<p>These WILL be ubiquitous.<p>As for: &quot;no instagram&quot;. Instagram is a fad. It&#x27;s not going to be around for years and years. If it pissed off tomorrow, noone would cry. Hell most people forget about it after a few days.<p>As for the iPhone&#x27;s &quot;isn&#x27;t it cool&quot; comment, hell it&#x27;s a piece of shit to develop for, especially when the SDK documentation and publishing platform buggers off for a month and they treat their paid up customers like crap...<p>These will start at the bottom of the market (like Android) and will push upwards.",1376315254

6199111,comment,6196279,6198944,7,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"The issues come in the mixed type cases. Consider this C program:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        long   x = 9007199254740992;    // 2^53
        double y = 9007199254740992.0;  // 2.0^53
        long   z = 9007199254740993;    // 2^53+1
        printf(&quot;x == y: %d\n&quot;, x == y);
        printf(&quot;y == z: %d\n&quot;, y == z);
        printf(&quot;x == z: %d\n&quot;, x == z);
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
Its output shows that &quot;==&quot; is not transitive in C:<p><pre><code>    x == y: 1
    y == z: 1
    x == z: 0
</code></pre>
On the other hand, &quot;==&quot; is transitive in Julia:<p><pre><code>    julia> x, y, z = 9007199254740992, 9007199254740992.0, 9007199254740993;

    julia> x == y, y == z, x == z
    (true,false,false)
</code></pre>
You have to be careful: if you compare &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; by converting &quot;z&quot; to Float64, they appear to be equal even though they represent entirely different integer values. When subtracting them, however, one does convert them to Float64, so their difference is zero:<p><pre><code>    julia> z - y
    0.0
</code></pre>
This kind of issue is why it&#x27;s so important to have a theory of what &quot;==&quot; means.",1376315005

It&#x27;s pretty safe to say that at this point, you need to make a splash or you&#x27;re going to end up an afterthought. You can&#x27;t just stumble in, you need to offer something compelling enough to convince others to get on board. Slow, evolutionary growth is fine for some things. It&#x27;s not OK for a mobile OS launching in the year 2013.<p>Call it bullying the new kid all you want to rally support, we&#x27;re just being realistic. When the vast majority of mobile phone users really couldn&#x27;t care less about how &quot;open&quot; their phone OS is, FFOS brings little to the table except catering to amateur developers. Considering what is holding back OSes like Windows Phone isn&#x27;t lack of apps from amateur developers, quite the opposite. They have those, but lack the heavy hitters.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard &quot;No thriving development environment for small developers&quot; once when covering the downsides of Windows Phone. I have heard &quot;No Instagram&quot; about a thousand times. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I don&#x27;t really remember an instance of any OS becoming popular by catering to small devs. It&#x27;s a part, but it usually comes AFTER enticing users to come aboard. People didn&#x27;t develop for iOS because Apple made it painfully easy for them, they developed for iPhone because millions of users bought them, said &quot;Isn&#x27;t this so cool, but I wonder if it could do <blank>?&quot; and the rest is history.<p>Likewise, developers weren&#x27;t chomping at the bit to go messing about in Eclipse, but millions and tens of millions of Android phones ended up in users hands.

Is this a euphemism or excuse? Euphemisms can be used to cover up other meanings like &quot;you look like a serial killer&quot; or &quot;bathe more.&quot; You might want to pursue those angles. Excuses can cover things like you wanting too much money, or being too strong in your opinions or knowledge. (Remember, the machine wants cogs, not governors.)<p>2. If you think it&#x27;s actually what they mean, I&#x27;d look at the word as they&#x27;re going to use it, which means &quot;socially withdrawn&quot; and not its actual meaning. Then I&#x27;d check these:<p>(a) Does my appearance scream &quot;socialization difficulty&quot;? Did I wear a monk&#x27;s habit to the job interview, or talk about 1980s classic videogames too much?<p>(b) Does my behavior scream &quot;socialization difficulty&quot;? If so, I&#x27;d approach this as you would any other technical problem. Find some &quot;normals&quot; to observe and pretend you&#x27;re James Bond, super spy, and imitate them. You must infiltrate the hive and shut off the reactor.<p>3. If none of the above are checked: something else is making them nervous. Talk to a recruiter, psychologist or other and have them observe you. Also, make sure no parts of your life or resume scream &quot;serial killer&quot; or &quot;probably molests goats.&quot;<p>4. If that&#x27;s not the case, think about where you&#x27;re applying. The machine loves cogs -- I said that already -- but sometimes, silly people in charge of silly companies want cheerful happy cheerleader types who will socialize a lot, get really excited over foosball, etc. They like these because they&#x27;re tractable and easily manipulated. These silly companies tend to be tech sweatshops that assess you based on the amount of code you grind, not how good it is. Do you want to work there anyway? If you do, you&#x27;re going to have to play Halloween dress-up and imitate what they want.<p>I will never support bias against introverted people just so that there can be the illusion (sorry, I mean &quot;appearance&quot;) of a happy enthusiastic go-get-&#x27;em workplace. That&#x27;s just silly. But if your appearance or behavior makes other people nervous, and they&#x27;re not nitwits, you might consider adopting a little bit of a charade so you can work with these people.",1376313708

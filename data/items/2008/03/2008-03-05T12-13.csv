I am thinking to try to do some homebrew on my Nintendo DS. I am experienced in embedded software development in C. What would you do next? Is it worth looking for a specific degree? As anyone experienced an online degree? Or is it better to invest time to learn by myself?",1204721085

You're creating some new product from scratch, and resources spent learning a new tool will be resources saved in future projects that use the same tool.<p>2, And old releases have bugs that will hardly be fixed because the support has been dropped. Follow the six month rule, and then, if you find more bugs, report. It is a lot more likely that the bugs in a new version will be fixed, and quickly, than in an old version.<p>3, The amount of resources the change will save due to its improvements. I am not saying it will always net positive, but it will also not net negativly always, so it is worth a study. Dismissing because ""We don't know"" is not a valid excuse, or should not be.<p>4, Once more, use the six months rule. Anything that is still a hype after six months in a fast paced market like IT is worth a look only for this merit.<p>5, Again, it depends on how much time the change will save BOTH in the current project and in future ones. A mistake always made is to consider only the current project as time spent. This is unfair and will lead to biased results that will cause the change to be refused nearly always.<p>6, You talk like my manager. Are you him?<p>I know you are not making any judgement. You are telling me what you have heard before, probably when faced with the same situation. Problem is, when faced with counter arguments the final answer is ""We don't know"" or ""We don't want to"". It is a lose lose situation.",1204720167

I love programming, sometimes even the Blub code I work on day to day, however I don't like sitting at a desk all day, so I'm thinking of a career change. Something in sports or perhaps physiotherapy, things like that.<p>Anyway, I will say that when it comes to making a go out of arts as a career, I'm watching a lot of my friends and acquaintances struggle hard. They're art students, musicians, actors and comedians, circus performers (my housemate; the place is littered with stilts and facepaint and whatnot) and despite some fantastic dedication to it they struggle to make a go of it. All work day jobs, some of the more talented and dedicated are in low paid arts-related jobs - administration, promotion etc. Most, now pushing into their late twenties and early thirties are starting to think about settling more permanently into the day jobs. Of course, north-west Ireland isn't Boston, so YMMV...<p>As to having your cake etc, do you do any such activities currently? If you're currently performing in plays etc or gathering the work needed for a gallery show and you can deal with the grind that entails, then I'd be more inclined to say go for it. If not, do so; I'd guess the best barometer of whether you'll have made the right decision is if you can cheerfully dedicate a few evenings a week over the course of the months to years it can take to get something into production.",1204719901

You cannot seriously expect that a company that isn't based in the US and isn't hosting their stuff in US is going to have to follow US patent law for products offered to people out of US?<p>As far as I know, any potentially patent-infringing stuff is kept very far from US-based servers.",1204719802

129641,comment,128993,129101,0,0,Novash,,,"But if you don't sit down to learn, you will never learn. You will fall into a chicken - egg trap. You will not use a new tool because you don't know if it is any better, and you will not know if it is any better because you did not use it. How to break the cycle?<p>By the way, it DOES take a long time to deeply learn your tools, but it takes a very short time to learn them enough to reach the same level of productivity than the older one, unless it is a complete shift of paradigm. This is specially true when you are moving to newer versions of the same programs, as long as some backward compatibility is kept, you will be not starting from scratch.",1204719322

If you gave the typical person free food and time off. They'd stuff themselves until they got diabetes and spend the rest of their time watching reruns of 'Room Raiders' on MTV.",1204718509

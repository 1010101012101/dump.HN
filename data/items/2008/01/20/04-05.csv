101144,comment,101134,101134,0,0,icky,,,"Maybe a workaround:<p>1. Ad server signs the text of the javascript code with an HMAC-style digest with a shared (private) key.  Maybe the first line of the text is the hash of the rest of it.  (Possibly also an advertiser-id jammed in there so the site knows which key to check).<p>2. Client pulls the javascript as plain text via XMLHttpRequest. (May require hacks or flash to do cross-domain on some browsers. :-( )<p>3. Client sends the whole thing via a POST XMLHttpRequest to the site's server.  (Remember, that only the advertiser and the site can have the same key; if the client can get it, the attacking site can, too).<p>4. Site's server returns some OK message with the hash to the client.<p>5. Client javascript calls eval on the text of the javascript.<p>That should keep anyone from injecting malicious javascript by stealing the advertiser's domain.  It does NOT protect against an attacker who has managed to get ahold of the secret key, but that's a lot trickier for them to do.",1200804462

101140,comment,100923,101083,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Good take.<p>I learned of the existence of Common Lisp about 1 year and 3 months ago, via PG's essays. There was this mysterious language I kept hearing about on Slashdot, that supposedly made you a much better programmer for the rest of your days if you learned it, and that was so much more advanced than Java, that was my only language at the time because I was ""fresh out of college"" (I actually dropped out at term 5 of 6 for mostly inconsequential reasons, one of them was gaming, now I stopped it entirely) and didn't know any better. Though in a sense, I did know better, because I was beginning to really ""bang my head"" on the ""low ceiling"" of Java, I was somehow attracted to metaprogramming techniques, I understood the repugnance of the boilerplate code, etc.<p>So, I read about all of PG's essays and researched it for 2 weeks, and I was hooked. I absolutely wanted to have those cool features like (apply) (and everything else really great about lisp), that I had so fondly dreamt of.<p>I spent the next year learning Common Lisp while writing my first website, and I have now developed (still evolving but mature-ish) a quite decent web framework! I made optimizing compilers for HTML and CSS, and I made a ""form validator compiler"" (among other stuff): you specify rules of validation in any order and it compiles into an optimized tree of closures that computes the stuff in the right order (well, actually it doesn't figure out the order itself yet because that's related to graph theory, and I have yet to learn that).<p>Could I ever have done so much in Java, or any other mainstream language? HECK NO! What I love most about Common Lisp is that it gives you 2 more responsibilties/powers basically. It places you in the seat of the language designer, and that of the compiler writer. That's my experience anyway. In Common Lisp, it's so easy to make new syntaxes and semantics that you can afford to use advanced techniques (ex: compiler writing) regularly and easily. It lets you deal with the hard stuff, if you're up to the challenge. As has been said, it's a language in which you think more than you write.<p>Common Lisp is my only language right now (well, except HTML, CSS, SQL and whatnot), but I plan to learn Haskell in maybe a year, and then maybe Erlang or some other cool language.<p>Also I want to rack up my computing (ex: algorithmic) and math skills, I could certainly use a more robust footing for the advanced stuff I want to make (like rule-based systems). I never liked math very much at school, and found it pretty useless, but now I'm really excited about learning things that will actually be of use for my work (and for me, work=play=life).<p>Hum... to go back on topic... well, that guy must have tried really hard not to find profound insights in lisp to succeed.",1200803683

They have to find a ""breakthrough"".<p>That's really not true, though many grad students (especially in physics) think it is. You need to make a useful research contribution, but it can be evolutionary.<p>My thesis problem is a very popular one: new Ph.D.'s are awarded monthly for incremental advances in this area. Only about 2 theses on the topic (in the past 10 years) have actually been breakthroughs. The rest are just marginal improvements, i.e. 1'st order -> 2'nd order -> 4'th order, spherical coordinates -> arbitrary spherical-like coordinates -> arbitrary coordinates, etc.",1200802410

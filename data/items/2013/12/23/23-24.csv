Then they have the ability to say, &quot;we&#x27;re also suffering here&quot;. Right now, they make more money when surge pricing is in effect and, since I don&#x27;t have a view into the algorithms, I can&#x27;t rule out that they more aggressively surge-price than is reasonable. In fact, I&#x27;d believe it to be almost certain that they do.<p>It&#x27;s the fact that Uber profits from misfortune (not surge pricing itself) that is making everyone hate them.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s about trade-offs, not absolutes. Is that 5x price hike saving me (compared to how long getting a cab would take) two hours, or 20 seconds? That would be worth knowing. If it&#x27;s 2 hours, the supply-and-demand argument makes sense: apparently, that&#x27;s how high the rates must go to compensate drivers for the unpleasantness. If it&#x27;s 20 seconds, then that&#x27;s a case of me getting screwed for a minor convenience priced unreasonably.",1387842815

The IPCC has released 5 reports. Their predictions were wrong every single time. AR0, AR1, AR2, AR3, the world did not warm anywhere near their 95% predictions. So let&#x27;s calculate. About one report every 5 years ... 95% &quot;certainty&quot; interval ... that means that if you believe the IPCC &quot;certainty&quot; they have made the mistakes they claim to make in 800000 (20^4 * 5) years, in 20 years.<p>Question for empiricists : why do you believe in climate change ? The predictions of climate change theory, as compiled by the IPCC, are falsified. It SHOULD be that simple.<p>Needless to say, color me in the &quot;chaotic climate change&quot; camp. I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not gotten warmer but I do say :<p>1) You cannot predict the effect of energy additions to a chaotic system. It may get colder as a result (and it has). Climate change theory only works on a planet in thermodynamic equilibrium, in other words, it would work on the moon. It doesn&#x27;t work on the earth. A famous paper was published in 1962 with a proof that climate was chaotic, and that should really have been the end of any prediction.<p>2) The fact that it&#x27;s chaotic means that there is no reasonable (finite, non-omniscient) way to predict climate evolution.<p>3) As a matter of principle, and organisation that publishes wrong predictions 4 times in a row should be laughed out of office, and out of funding. I think that this didn&#x27;t happen indicates we just really, really, really want to believe climate change is happening and is human-caused.",1387841841

The subprograms aren&#x27;t &quot;libraries&quot; in a sense that I do much faster changes to the &quot;interface&quot; but just having them makes everything much more maintainable.

Practically every CPU I know of is specifically optimized to make addressing elements in the C structure as efficient as possible.<p>In your case, if there are a lot of functions to which you pass the pointer to the structure, then if you take care of the organization it means that they really do have to operate on the structure.

Author is pining for his old, low-end feature phone after using ZTE Open<p>Basic phone stuff such as calling, texting work pretty well. These are common things that all phones do well right now.<p>> * While adaptive search may not be a market place, if it looks like one to the user, then it will be percieved like one and confuse the user.<p>Adaptative search does not look like a marketplace, it looks like a search engine. There is a marketplace icon that launches the marketplace app which has a experience similar to other app stores. Bonus point: Our app store is open source, you can fork it and create your own.<p>> * Platform ecosystem is a valid critiscism. The main criticism of windows mobile is lack of apps. While that is not the systems fault, MS are being active in improving this, since they know that this is the main feature of a modern smart phone. If Mozilla don&#x27;t realize this either, they are in trouble. It may not be ffOS&#x27;s fault that the twitter app is bad, by users don&#x27;t want it if it doesn&#x27;t have a good twitter app.<p>Mozilla has paid staff and volunteers working on making the experiences better. Lots of the vendors are listening and improving. Remember this platform is on its first year and yet we&#x27;re moving very fast.<p>> * Critiscism of here maps should be directed at ffOS. Other maps exists, mozilla has strong ties with Google, Mozilla chose this one as default. Also see above. My limited experience with here maps from windows mobile showed me a great service, so maybe the author is off on this one.<p>Here Maps is also going thru updates and is working better than before. Its a good map. I like the offline saving of maps, makes me use less internet.<p>> I don&#x27;t know what the feature phone market looks like in Brazil, but if its anything like the Chinese, then it doesn&#x27;t sound like the ZTE Open beats the feature phone market.<p>We don&#x27;t have the ZTE open in here, we have the Alcatel One Touch Fire and the LG Fireweb. They are all similar. They perform better than the feature phones. Our main difficulty right now is the lack of apps (its getting better) and the quality of some apps (its also getting better).<p>> I was getting a ffOS phone for christmas, until I realized that the only one available to me is a ZTE Open. It really does look like a crappy representative for ffOS, but if this is what Mozilla and ZTE decided on, then the software side should run more than decently.<p>The ZTE is a cool phone but it is a low end device, you can&#x27;t compare it with a heavily subsided phone such as the moto g. They have different purposes.<p>One thing that some people often doesn&#x27;t realize is that Mozilla launched an open system with at least 4 hardware partners and 18 carriers this year. A system that promotes open standards and freedom from a community that values your privacy. Mozilla doesn&#x27;t operate to generate profit and answers to no one but the users. This is a system made by people that have the same values as we do and we&#x27;re moving fast.",1387841422

They asked me & my wife (being younger in our 30-40-ies) for a phone and whether it&#x27;ll work in Italy. I gave them the ZTE, explained how to change the SIM card in Italy - and they&#x27;ve used it without any problem. Yes - there was only one photo taken, but they were able to use it for it&#x27;s real purpose - a phone! - And on top of that I encouraged them to not get overly panicky if something happened with the phone - after all it&#x27;s just $80 bucks. So they were pretty good testers, and I got back the phone and it still works.<p>I&#x27;m planning on using it in Bulgaria (my home country) and I feel it&#x27;ll serve it&#x27;s purpose - e.g. talking on the phone.<p>As for apps - there could be some improvements - for example if it&#x27;s possible to clearly separate online & offline apps - so I know what&#x27;s gonna work on the plane, or when I don&#x27;t have connection - or if there is some way to &quot;wget&quot; the app in (if it makes sense though).<p>Thanks for providing one more good alternative!",1387840625

6957231,comment,6952315,6953617,1,0,mrxd,,,"Here are three responses to your question:<p>1) It&#x27;s not always true that users lack insight or imagination into new possibilities. Many of our best futurists aren&#x27;t technologists - Gene Roddenberry, for example. On the opposite side, programmers can sometimes be resistant to new ideas because they judge the effort to be too high for the benefit. This would be the equivalent something like &quot;If you ask engineers, they&#x27;ll tell you to buy a faster horse because internal combustion engines are expensive, hard to build and horses are faster anyway (at the beginning they were anyway).&quot; What this misses is that speed isn&#x27;t the key benefit. If you talked to users, you&#x27;d probably discover their needs are lower maintenance costs and improving reliability. Users didn&#x27;t want to go faster, they wanted to get rid of the horse.<p>2) UCD is not about asking users to invent new ideas, architect the system or tell us how to implement it (i.e. do you want a horse or an engine?). It&#x27;s about including the users&#x27; perspective in how we assess the benefits and drawbacks of a technology. Engineers tend to want to do this by quantifying aspects of the technical system (megahertz, megapixels, MTBF, softer measures like code quality), excluding a broader perspective of the socio-technical system—the system in a social, human context of use.<p>3) Developers are often resistant to including the users in the design process because they feel that it impinges on their autonomy, especially when it interferes with their desire to innovate. There&#x27;s a little bit of... well, hypocrisy is maybe too strong a word, so let&#x27;s say inconsistency in this. Developers defend their own autonomy and right to direct their own work, and rightly so. But they then argue that it should be taken away (or at least not given) to the users of the technologies they build, technologies which deeply affect the work and lives of those users. As I argue in the article, excluding users has a negative impact on developer autonomy, because UX designers are brought in, reducing and sometimes eliminating developer control, except for the most talented and insightful.",1387840530

6957208,comment,6956209,6956625,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes, those crooked contracts. Just because the labels give artists an advance doesn&#x27;t make it virtuous, they&#x27;re still shady as hell. They are every bit as crooked as classic &quot;company store&quot; based labor practices of old, the big difference is that it&#x27;s not dancing around the poverty line so it&#x27;s not quite so malevolent.<p>Nevertheless, compare a music label advance to a business loan, a mortgage, or VC investment. With a loan or a mortgage the financier takes a risk and puts money behind someone buying a house or building a business. But the obligation of the person on the other end of the risk is to pay back the loan plus interest, and the interest is how the risk of the loan is mitigated. With VC an investment is made in a venture and in exchange the investor is given a share of the venture, when the company is acquired or goes public the investor then owns a decent chunk of a now liquid asset and can either continue ownership or cash out and effectively earn RoI on their original risk taking.<p>But a music label advance is a very different and far more unreasonable beast. First the label loans the artist money in the form of an advance. Then the label takes majority ownership of the artist&#x27;s works. Then the label requires the artist to fund production of their next album, music video, etc. out of their advance. The label gives a small share of the profits from the artist&#x27;s works back to them which they must use to repay the advance. Meanwhile, the label takes a larger share of the profits for themselves. Additionally, the label may or may not spend money promoting the artist, but we should not look at this as virtuous because they are promoting their own products at this point.<p>The genius of this system is that the amount of money the labels take in from their share of the album revenue is effectively hidden, so artists can&#x27;t tell how profitable their work has been for the labels. Moreover, by forcing the artists to pay back the loan out of their smaller share of the profits and forcing the artists to pay for album production out of their advance it minimizes the overhead the labels have to pay and increases their profitability while simultaneously making albums look less profitable than they actually are for the labels. Hollywood pulls similar accounting tricks with movies to dick people out of their rightful share of profits.<p>Imagine a world where VCs took complete control over startups, took the lions share of the profits, and forced founders to pay back initial investments out of a small share of company profits, while also requiring the company to pay developer salaries out of that small profit slice and the initial investment money. Nobody would stand for such a crap system, but many artists continue to allow themselves to be suckered into a similar exchange because it&#x27;s the norm in the music industry and because most artists tend not to be business savvy.",1387840185

(Nothing wrong with that, as long as you aren&#x27;t confused into thinking you&#x27;re &quot;saving money&quot; buying new.)<p>Need a &quot;new&quot; car and want to save money? Buy a late model (3-5 years old) car with higher than average miles on it. It will be cheaper than the average used car, because people are inordinately &quot;afraid&quot; of miles on cars. Late model, as it will still &quot;look kind of new&quot; (so scratching that itch), will likely have recent safety advances, and in areas of the country that salt the roads, it will have fewer years of salt exposure than a similar miles at an average rate used car. High miles in 3-5 years probably got a lot of highway use and surely got a lot of regular use. Those miles aren&#x27;t as hard on cars as the &quot;creampuff&quot;, low miles, sat in traffic for hours each day cars.<p>Once you&#x27;ve bought it, find a good independent mechanic for that brand (or a general independent). Will be way cheaper than the dealership, and in my experience, just as good. I do all my own maintenance (ex-tires and ex-exhaust), but a good indy will save you a bunch of money as well.<p>My car (&#x27;98 Mercedes E300) just flipped over 210,000 miles on the way into work today. It will be retired in 1-3 more years due to rust, not mechanical malady. I paid about $6000 about 4.5 years ago, and I&#x27;ve got an additional $650-ish worth of parts into it over the 4 years. Brakes will be good for the duration, and if it lasts 3 more years, I&#x27;ll need tires, but if I retire it next year, it won&#x27;t. That&#x27;ll mean more than 5 years of service for $5000 in depreciation and out-of-pocket maintenance expenses, as I&#x27;ll be able to sell it for $1500 or so running but rusty.<p>That&#x27;s a little bit of an extreme case as I do all my own work, so the $650 number would be more than double that (glowplugs, brakes all around, and two window regulators would be the labor needed), but I&#x27;ve driven a pretty decent-looking, mid-sized diesel Mercedes for 4.5 years and over 30,000 miles for under $100 per month in purchase and maintenance costs. I paid almost as much in diesel as I paid for the car over its life. (I get just under 30 mpg, and diesel is a hair under $4/gal.)<p>Buying the new equivalent of my car? $51,400 base MSRP.\n<a href=\"http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-E/model-E250BTC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-E/model-E...</a><p>Drive that 4 years and 30,000 miles and it&#x27;s likely worth $30K, or a per-month cost of around $500/mo, five times as much.

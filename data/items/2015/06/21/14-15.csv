Getting a symbol out of an object is a dictionary lookup. An object creation is always an allocation; variables don&#x27;t go on the stack. Everything is reference counted. The old &#x27;range&#x27; builtin would create an actual list of that length in memory, rather than just keep track of the start and end points like a C-style for loop.<p>Other implementations could theoretically do better. PyPy can detect after a while that a variable can safely be declared on the stack, and so it will start to do that. If the object type is known, then a field lookup becomes just adding an offset to the pointer. It can even use different implementations for the same Python-visible classes (to store a range result in constant space, but still appear to be the full list, or use a different type of dictionary for objects and {}, or other things like that).",1434898594

9753606,comment,9753366,9753366,0,0,overgard,,,"Yes. It&#x27;s much faster. The reason C++ is fast is because you have explicit control over allocations and it compiles to native code (among other reasons). There are also a lot of subtle things that you can control in C++ that you can&#x27;t in python, like memory layout. Memory layout is extremely important for CPU cache, and CPU cache is extremely important for performance. (Reading data from RAM is generally orders of a magnitude slower than reading from an L1 or L2 cache. For some reason this never gets mentioned in university CS courses, but there are a lot of data structures that are &quot;theoretically&quot; fast for certain things but in practice very unfriendly to hardware. For instance, linked lists. Sure insert/delete is O(1), but since linked lists are quite possibly the least cache friendly data structures in existence, you&#x27;re better off with a vector/array even if you&#x27;re inserting all the time. I&#x27;m not just making this up, you can read talks by people like Bjarne Stroustroup on this topic)<p>As to whether it matters for the algorithm, it depends on the algorithm. It&#x27;s almost always going to be much faster in C, but, how fast do you really need it to be? Python is very good at saving programmer time, so if performance is not particularly important, I just wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.",1434897538

Trucks operate on streets and roads, which are clearly identified and known to pedestrians as a hazardous location where extra attention to the rules and conditions is required.  While streets and roads could be made safer for pedestrians (and, often, should!), there are literally billions of pedestrian-vehicle interactions every day that are perfectly safe.  This is possible because a street is largely a 2- or even 1-dimensional environment with clear, well-known rules for sharing safely and (generally) good visibility so that every participant can get a full mental picture of that environment.<p>Aircraft operate everywhere, and at an altitude well above where most people would think to look.  The danger from aircraft is not that a 10kg craft rams you horizontally at 5 m/s while it flies 1 meter above the same sidewalk you&#x27;re using (though even that would probably cause significant injuries).  It&#x27;s that a 10kg aircraft you never saw, thought to avoid, or even had an opportunity to avoid falls 100 meters onto your head.  That, by the way, is going to &quot;kill or cause horrific injuries&quot; every single time.<p>It&#x27;s fine to hate automobiles.  They&#x27;re not perfect.  They do have collisions, and sometimes those collisions kill humans.  That&#x27;s unfortunate, and worth improving.  Most of them also burn fossil fuels, which needs to stop (in most of the world, drones will either burn fossil fuels or have batteries charged by electricity generated by a coal-fired power plant, so they&#x27;re not better).  But your &quot;consistent solution&quot; is absurd: a near-total elimination of economic activity in exchange for a very modest reduction in the human death rate.

It really helps in thinking about solving problems, which is what engineering is all about.  Insisting that everyone must either agree to ban all automobiles or accept the uncontrollable and unavoidable risk of having others&#x27; property fall on their head anywhere at any time is not a constructive position and will not help you solve problems.<p>A more useful approach might be to ask yourself what would be required to make UAV flights safer.  Are there environments or applications for which these problems could be minimized?  What regulations or restrictions would help?  Or maybe you&#x27;d like to tackle pedestrian safety in urban areas, a much better-studied set of problems.

You don&#x27;t want applicants that can convince you they&#x27;re obsessive fans of your company, you want applicants that are interested in their work and whose interests line up with the job you&#x27;re offering.<p>For many jobs, you don&#x27;t even need that. There are a lot of jobs where any given applicant will have applied to dozens if not hundreds of companies. The only thing an enthusiastic cover letter tells you in those cases is that they are lying.<p>Unless you&#x27;re looking for co-founders or C-level managers, they don&#x27;t have to have big ideas about how they can make your company better. But they should know how to do their job and be interested in finding ways to help you help them do their job better.<p>Job applications are for coarse filtering based on vague qualifiers. Two years experience as a C# drone at a bank? Too bad, we&#x27;re looking for Clojure greybeards. Shoddy formatting and everything is misspelled? We need people that care about the quality of their deliverables. And so on. It&#x27;s a first impression, not a hiring decision.<p>Of course this all depends on the number of applicants, the number of openings and the size of the company.<p>But yes, if you expect certain things to be in a job application, be explicit about it. If you want the cover letter to answer some interview questions ahead of the actual interview, say so.",1434895713

And the USG is well-aware that China and Russia and even Iran could do this too.<p>So regarding <i>why</i> things were left way at OPM, your guess is as good as mine... I mean &quot;just don&#x27;t let China hack in&quot; is pretty unachievable (they even got Google a few years back, after all), but at least structure your networks to make it so that hacking one database doesn&#x27;t give away the keys to everything, move highly-sensitive material off-network completely, etc.<p>But these things require changes, which requires money (and brainpower), and buy-in from dozens of other government agencies, and probably more things besides.<p>None of this is to <i>excuse</i> OPM--I would expect my government leaders to suck resources from elsewhere if need be, accept temporary degradation to other systems that interfaced to this personnel database, or in short to _do whatever they had to do to pro-actively address the threat they knew was out there_. And they didn&#x27;t.<p>> That&#x27;s standard procedure for the NSA. No surprise there.<p>Should be &quot;That&#x27;s standard procedure for state espionage agencies&quot;. I mean, if you&#x27;re approaching this from the perspective that China is doing this only because NSA is out there you&#x27;re already misinformed. Half of the reason NSA <i>has</i> been doing this is because Russia and China and friends will be doing things like this anyways.<p>In China&#x27;s case especially they drastically re-oriented their entire military and geo-strategic outlook following the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. This incident occurred between 1995-1996, and culminated in the U.S. sending <i>2</i> full carrier strike groups near Taiwan, one of the groups actually sailed through the Strait of Taiwan, sending a pointed message about who had military supremacy in the South China Sea.<p>The rise in Chinese military power many of spoken of effectively started here... but they didn&#x27;t limit their buildup to &quot;hard&quot; forms of national power.<p>Indeed, given the reliance on so much of the global electronics supply chain on Chinese factories there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity for appearances of SHTF...",1434895697

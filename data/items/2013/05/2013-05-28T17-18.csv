What it's worth to me is the upper boundary, I ought never to pay more than that - what it's worth to you is the lower boundary, you ought never to accept less than that (probably what it cost you to get vs your leverage advantage - most likely scarcity) - and what's in between we can deal over. If you have two estimates, one really large and one really low, for what's essentially the same thing, that implies to me that you just don't know what a fair price for what your software does is.<p>If I know that you consider something to be absolutely cheaper then I also know that your bargaining position is likely dramatically wider than you might like to convince me it is. I <i>know</i> you can go much lower than you do.<p>As a strategy, having two prices wouldn't work on me. It's too fishy. Perpetual being bad doesn't make subscription good. It just means you value someone choosing sub and are prepared to offer them a substantial discount to get them to do it. Or to put it another way: Why are the permanent terms so much less advantageous to you that you're prepared to charge 'significantly [more]' for them before you agree? My instinct says there's a trick there - you wouldn't be trying to get me to go with the cheaper option so strongly unless there was some long-term advantage for you in doing so, data lock-in perhaps, or the knowledge that people don't, in practice, upgrade as much as you hope.<p>Why do you value someone choosing sub?

If someone can hijack a session, that's obviously already a problem, but unfortunately XSS attacks are fairly common as they are something that can happen in any number of places on a website, and even vigilant developers will probably miss some. (See, for example, the recent XSS attacks reported on Paypal).<p>If you use a random token to a session that will be invalidated, then the attacker is at least time-limited. If you just naively sign an auth cookie and trust it later, he has a replay attack that will work permanently until you change your code.<p>As for you other suggestion, restricting sessions by IP address can be done no matter where the session data is stored. It will help to mitigate session hijacking in general, but it also degrades the experience, especially for mobile users, who will have to re-login every time they change IP addresses.

At that point, they will be much easier to have, and less hacky.<p>The 'call a bike' system is interesting, and differs from the overall scheme of most bike sharing systems. You have to call a number, enter a pin, and then you get a code to unlock the chain. I find it pretty intelligent, but a bit conflicting with what I have currently running.<p>At the same time, both systems are really small in stations, but big in locations (as in, there are lots of cities). That's the main reason I have to not support them at the moment, and the main reason of rewriting the architecture of the project. I did not know the project was going to grow at the start, so every city is a different module, if possible, with some inheritance. The new architecture [1] will feature systems as instances, instead of a separated class, thus, making it trivial to generate instances on the run.<p>Not sure if I went too far with the response, hope it's useful.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes/wiki/architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes/wiki/architecture</a>",1369763498

Given the opportunity to leapfrog a generation of technology and infrastructure while doing less damage to the environment is a now brainer.  Plus, investing in solar gives the US the opportunity to liquiefy the natural gas and export it, helping the trade imbalance and displacing the new coal fired plants being built abroad.<p>When building a power plant the expected return is usually about 40 years.  We shouldn't be asking ourselves what infrastructure we want in 5-10 years, but how we want our energy infrastructure to look in 30-50 years.  In 30 years I'm pretty confident solar will be cheaper than natural gas, so why build out all this infrastructure to switch to natural gas cars etc?<p>At best natural gas is a good resource for handling the intermittency problem with solar.

5781332,comment,5777719,5780476,2,0,Millennium,,,"Pretty much, yeah. This is really just a generalization of the principle we see in the length of a binary password. The complexity is s^l, where s is the number of symbols you can possibly draw from, and l is the number of symbols in the password.<p>Consider a binary string. There are two symbols in binary (1 and 0) and the number of symbols you use is the number of bits in the string. This gives us the familiar password length calculation: the complexity is 2^l.<p>When you start using words as the basic unit, you gain many more symbols: if you use the full Oxford English Dictionary, you have about 600,000 of them. But when you do this, your symbol is no longer a single byte: it's a word. That word can be represented as a string of bytes, yes, but it's guaranteed that this string will be one of the 600,000 byte strings that represent English words, and you can eliminate all of the others. So you can't measure your password in bytes anymore; you have to measure it in words instead. A one-word password is, therefore, of complexity (600,000^1).<p>Six hundred thousand possibilities sounds like a lot, but computers can crack that in seconds. Even if you restrict yourself to just printable ASCII, you can do better than that in only three characters. I don't recommend actually doing a three-character printable-ASCII password, because you'd have just under 900,000 possible passwords: still well within crackable range.<p>But because the complexity increases so fast as you increase the length of the password, that's how you can gain complexity back. If you use four words instead of one, you have (600,000^4) possibilities: some 130 sextillion. You'd need 70 random bits, or 11 printable ASCII characters, to do better.<p>And that, my friends, is why ""k[0"" is a better password than ""antidisestablishmentarianism"". But it's also why ""correct horse battery staple"" is better than either one (or would be, if xkcd hadn't made it so famous).",1369762563

It supports arbitrary plugins, such that other dependent systems can inject their own implementation code if necessary. It depends on kernel notification APIs and network notification APIs that are implemented at a different level.<p>launchd: Starting/stopping/restarting services, on-demand and on a schedule, per-user and system-wide.<p>diskarbitrationd: Handles mounting/unmounting of file systems, and notifies clients of changes to mounted file systems.<p>opendirectoryd: Handles namespacing of local and remote user/data directories. This includes LDAP, local user accounts, etc.<p>mDNSResponder: Used to be just the mdns daemon, now handles all name resolution and local caching.<p>All of these things have been iterated on independently over time, are loosely coupled with each other, and <i>do not</i> create tight bindings between Mac OS X and open source software, nor do they require huge non-portable changes to open-source software.<p>The precursor to opendirectoryd was netinfo, which also used to handle name resolution and caching. Later releases of Mac OS X moved name resolution into directory services, and then eventually into mDNSResponder. launchd replaced system starter (similar to initd/rc), cron, and a number of other services, but maintained 'perfect' backwards compatibility with the standard configuration file formats (eg, crontab(5)).<p>These are just a few of the (independently maintained, internally) projects/daemons that Mac OS X layers together to produce the desktop. You don't need a huge monolthic project to tackle all these problem domains, as evidenced by the fact that Mac OS X works.<p>You also benefit from laying these projects cleanly, as it allows them to tackle what they're good at, provide a stable interface, or even be swapped out entirely later.",1369761644

So which is the real conceptual primary key?  Shouldn't you use the full name as the ""primary key""?<p>Problem: What if the business logic of what a distinct user is changes from unique ""full name"" to unique ""full name"" and ""telephone number"".  Whoops now all your foreign keys need messing with, its just a bad scene.  Ditto schema changes like you finally change from ascii to utf8 or something, now all your foreign keys need changing (well thats maybe a bad example unless your ascii datatype enforces 7 bits or you're running into byte length vs character length limits...)  Or you change the length, which changes the truncation perhaps, which changes your foreign keys.  Also you can't just use a rule like all foreign keys are BIGINT now some are CHAR(20) some are FLOAT who knows.<p>On the other hand lets say you implement just a prikey.  Now you can have multiple rows with the same data, because you never set up a UNIQUE INDEX.<p>Generally speaking if you KNOW absolutely KNOW that your schema will never change, you should probably optimize it to not have multiple keys aka a primary key and unique indexes, or data definition will never change.  Very few people can guarantee it so they're better off in the real world with imaginary prikeys.<p>You can read a lot more about this in ""SQL antipatterns"" I think chapter 4 or so, but always keep in mind that beyond noob level of being able to define the overall issue, short term snapshots will occasionally (but not always) conflict with longer term thinking.",1369761561

Now, I understand that to some extent you were making a point about how Ghanaian society views internet scamming. But still, it seems to be saying that ""Nigerian scams"" are a problem (a cost) that we should consider when planning to increase internet availability in Africa. Is the proportion of Ghanaians using the internet for that sort of activity really so large as to merit even discussing it? And anyway, Europeans and Americans make substantial use of the internet for child abuse and to support abusive areas of the global pornography industry; should we consider that as a disincentive for improving internet technology for Europeans and Americans?<p>> I guess the problem with these small internet cafes is that the most likely early adopters are these 419'ers.<p>> Anyway, I wonder how getting internet access to everyone will impact all of this. Maybe it will force the local governments to really start taking the problem seriously.<p>The question here is ""problem for whom""?

I'd hesitate to call statistics an engineering discipline, granted, but I object to differentiating statistics from CS on the basis of the word ""hard"".<p>I hope you're not trivializing statistics simply because of the elementary approach most schools tend to take for the first three or four statistics classes offered at the university level. I would argue that statistics can be just as difficult as computer science, and just like CS has intractable problems, so too does statistics.<p>If your idea of big data is acturial tables, you're not thinking big enough. Actuarial tables are largely still small enough to be handled in orthodox ways using orthodox software (SAS has a deathgrip in managed health--what I do for a living--and it's a 50 year old piece of software). In fact, most of the times I hear people say their data has a very high volume, it really doesn't, and the traditional methods of data analysis can handle it. Once you step into Facebook/Amazon/Google sized data, things change. And that's only looking at ""big data"" as large volume--the most common definitions of the phrase involve several other variables (see: the four V's).<p>Just because what's commonly done or visible is elementary doesn't mean the entire field is elementary.

In short, if I was looking for developers to do sharding, I would actually prefer to AVOID queries with joins, non-pk lookups etc.<p>Having said that, I have discovered a heuristic over the years: that if you are using an ORM, you probably don't want a relational database. You should learn something like Riak and let it handle the distribution and provide all the partitioning and availability for you. The CAP theorem shows that you can't get it all, and most likely you want to use one of those data stores instead of a relational one.<p>For regular sites that won't have millions of users constantly using it, though, a relational db is fine.",1369760626

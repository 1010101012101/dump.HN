Relational databases, as they are currently implemented, might be getting long in the tooth now:\n<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2500</a><p>However, given the relational model's foundation in set theory and predicate logic, it seems you'd be hard pressed to replace it with something else that can offer the same data integrity guarantees.",1206604236

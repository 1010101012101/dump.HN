I'm in the process of learning as much as possible about recognition techniques.<p>According to the FAQ, you're not performing face detection (you ask users to crop their photos). Did you find that the process was too computationally expensive?<p>EDIT - after completing the registration process I was given an error page. But the process must've completed, since I can log in and use the site just fine.<p>I have some additional comments (for instance, when cropping my user photo it'd be nice to see an example of a ""good crop"" so I know how tightly to focus the box around my face, without having to click through to the guidelines page). Is there an email address I can contact you at?",1193812366

I can sum it up in two words: Social Capital.<p>I'm not saying this ""competes"" with facebook,per se.  Rather, it's just an alternative to the idea of an ""open (proprietary) API"" that has failed in so many ways (uselessness of applications, nagging app requests, lack of universality for things like classes, etc).  I'll be writing a blog post on this very topic soon.<p>I hope that clears things up a bit.",1193812198

74560,comment,45698,45698,0,0,Nick67,,,"I would add a ninth point.  ""Leave distinctive footprints."" I have written good code, that worked completed as desired, that I knew inside and out--that I then revisited a year later and couldn't make heads or tails of it.  I learned.   Now when I do something new, something elegant, or something complex, I document it immediately well enough to re-grasp it in short order--and document it idiosyncratically.  When I come back to the code--or more frquently, come to another conundrum that will need a similar or transmogrified approach--that idosyncratic documentation is there, and I can search for it, and grasp the code ideas it embodied.  It helps immensely with those disruptions that invariably occur.  I still vividly recall when I first grasped the immense power of Select Case True because of the kitschy commenting I wrote for it--and I called up that commenting and that code for quite some time!

Here are some I&#x27;ve learned along the path:<p>1. Understand and listen to what causes you suffering and leads to dissonance. For example, what makes you not want to think about technology when you clearly used to love it? What is your emotional response to thinking about not traveling for the next year? Acknowledge the emotions you have and realize the questions will never end.<p>2. Set intent. What things can you do in your life to enable step #1 to happen faster? Explore your options. There is an answer out here for your question, but it takes you to find it.<p>3. Keep your intent free of dissonance. Biases, blaming or speaking for others, and rationalizations are indications of dissonance that&#x27;ll just slow you down and hinder you doing #2.<p>4. Use #2 to drive putting yourself into situations, in all parts of your life, that encourage #1 to happen faster. You switched teams. Are you willing to switch companies? Careers? Doing #1 is frequently scary. Try to face your fears.<p>Glad you posted! You aren&#x27;t the only one going through this, by a long shot.",1452463196

The engineering culture is defined by Levels..Level 3, 4, 5 etc. Consistency is promoted over quality. Codebases were so horribly not DRY it makes me want to vomit.<p>Unit tests for constants -- unit tests for specific code inside of functions.<p>I can go on and on. But generally the place is ran like it&#x27;s a sales company primarily. Not an engineering company.<p>Amazon has a cancer through out it. It&#x27;s basically a shitty copy of Microsoft without any of the virtues..but all the vices.<p>Not to mention, it says a lot that they have no perks except &quot;free tea.&quot; 12 Leadership principles, which are dumb shit like &quot;Be curious&quot;, &quot;Have instinct.&quot;<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t have the brightest or the best - they have sheep that get tangled in the middle, or assholes that somehow become management. The company is only surviving because it set its margins so low that no one else could compete.<p>But now market leaders are sprouting out. Chewy.com for pet food. Walmart.com for general goods. Drugstore.com / Soap.com / Walgreens.com, the list goes on.<p>With such a shitty internal culture, Amazon will fall. I will have a shit-eating grin when that happens.<p>---------------------------<p>Amazon Web Services was their saving grace. But having seen internally how each team has different practices, different tech..some that are arcane and esoteric. Theres no cohesion. Even the CSS for Amazon, theres no sheet that is shared. Each team has to hard-rip the colors and whatnot from other projects like the retail site.<p>Makes me totally re-evaluate AWS after seeing how its built internally.<p>The charm of AWS is that every service in that goddamn console looks like its a polished part of a pyramid of engineering sanctity.<p>Heh, wrong. Each service...written by a different team, with totally different methods, totally different tech. Some teams even use .NET and IIS... You can probably probe the endpoints to some of these services and maybe see it externally. But well, take my word for it.<p>Once a team has a decent AWS project, they slap together a new logo. Make the UI blend with the existing panel. And then scale it using existing AWS services. But it still is a hydra of mismatched code.<p>The whole thing is a frankenturd - they did a good job with the design, ui, and IAM policies to make these services look like they are all part of the same cohesive development.

We had experiences very much along the same lines of failing again for doing the very thing they asked of us in the previous rejection.<p>Anyway, usually it works out eventually. No problem with making some noise about it being bad, and hopefully they hear it, but it is not uncommon, nor unique to Amazon.<p>The point about registering a URL isn&#x27;t entirely accurate, IMO; plenty of Apple App Store apps consist partially or entirely of webviews. Even for fully native apps, Apple doesn&#x27;t really have &quot;control&quot; of the code in the sense described in the article. Registration and the approval process are primarily there to give the publishers control over what appears in their store, as well as identify the submitters in a way that attempts to keep a little bit of accountability should they do something bad.

10877366,comment,10875200,10875200,0,0,robgibbons,,,"Determinism should be the obvious starting point for both physicists and philosophers. The idea that any action or set of events can unfold outside of prior physical causes underlies the idea of free will, but it also essentially contradicts the law of causality: every event has an exact set of causes, prior conditions which map perfectly to the resulting effects of a given system. The claim that your actions are purely the result of your own decisions does not factor your thinking itself as being a fundamentally physical process, governed only by physics. Thinking is a natural process, founded on top of other natural processes, and bound ultimately by the greater forces of causality. Of course, quantum randomness on a fundamental level may alter the effects of these processes such that the future cannot be predicted, but it does not dispute the fundamentally physical, and thus causal, nature of thought.",1452462534

It&#x27;s lawyers - malpractice insurance can take upwards of 25+% of your income - and it&#x27;s insurance companies, who have shareholders they are responsible to, and it&#x27;s hospital administration, whose positions keep multiplying.<p>It&#x27;s a red herring. If you compare physician compensation in the UK to the US, the costs of medical education are made up within the first ten years. Yes, even after malpractice insurance. Hospital administrators are also wildly overpaid, but there just aren&#x27;t as many of them. Physician compensation as compared to foreign doctors, which get the same or better results, is just too large a piece of the pie to brush under the rug by pointing at other problems.",1452462490

10877359,comment,10872657,10872657,0,0,api,,,"The US was less centralized than the USSR, but not by as large of a margin as most think. It&#x27;s always -- even going back to the days of Manifest Destiny and such -- been a planned economy where major economic moves and expansions are driven by edict and funded by the state or central banks.<p>I&#x27;m not really aware of a good example of a complex technologically advanced society that isn&#x27;t centrally planned to a significant degree. Either it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, libertarianism being a form of political futurism, or central planning is actually necessary to overcome the natural tendency of human societies and economies toward conservatism and inertia.<p>But you still have the mythology of America, land of the free, where everything is grassroots. You can even see this mythology at work in popular accounts of Silicon Valley. In reality most of the fundamental bedrock innovations that created the Valley were funded by DARPA, NASA, and other state sources in the 1960s, and the existence of the Valley as a concentration of tech talent dates from the concentration of radar and signals intelligence industries there in WWII. Look up a talk called &quot;The Secret History of Silicon Valley&quot; on YouTube. In more modern times there are still strong hints of a deep connection, such as the ties that may exist between large tech firms like Google and the state, though the extent of these ties is a subject of some controversy.<p>I&#x27;d actually be curious to hear an example of a major bedrock innovation (like semiconductors, ICs, orbital rockets, etc.) that has occurred in the past ~75 years and has <i>not</i> been the product of either government research funding or a state-enforced monopoly (e.g. Ma Bell / Bell Labs). Only such entities have sufficient exemption from market realities to permit such long-sighted and high-risk investments.<p>Therein lies, I think, one of the big fallacies of the freedom myth-- that markets drive innovation. In reality I think innovation requires at least a period of exemption from markets, since markets mandate short-term thinking. At a smaller scale seed and venture capital allows companies to obtain a <i>short</i> reprieve from the market that in some cases is long enough to allow some innovation to occur before everything has to answer to the god of quarterly profit. If markets get really good at providing such funding it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that we could see a future of decentralized market-driven innovation, but this would require a further extension and broadening of the seed/angel/VC model and associated financial instruments that properly model the nature of this kind of investment. We need entities able to make 10-20 year investments in small teams of brilliant people to tackle insanely hard problems the way national labs and academic institutes can, but time frames like that are way outside the parameters of your typical fund turnaround time.",1452462489

Drude came up with a simple approach for modelling metals. He assumed electrons would scatter off the atomic ions, all behaving classically like balls. Even this incredibly simplistic model, which ignores the important effects of both the quantum nature of electrons, and the crystalline lattice ordering of atoms in a metal, can predict Ohm&#x27;s Law.

And the 2nd-order electron-lattice-electron interaction that allows Cooper pairing and superconductivity.<p>You can also get strange things in nanoscale systems, such as non-Ohmic ballistic electronic current, where resistance is only due to the contacts of a device but not the length.",1452461019

I spent 80-100 hour weeks keeping a dying startup alive for a year without pay before finally leaving.  My mental state was very similar to what you describe:  Loss of interest, decreased self-worth, and an uncertain future.  It sucks and I&#x27;m sorry you are going through it.<p>I wish I could tell you how to move past it, but I haven&#x27;t figured that out yet.  I also suspect different things work for different people.<p>I agree with the others who suggested this may be burnout and/or depression.  It was in my case, although I am predisposed due to personal and family history.  Consider therapy, meds, exercise, socializing, and self-help books.  I recommend the CBT-family of therapies (CBT/DBT/ACT/REBT) and books by Albert Ellis and David Burns in particular.  Therapy and self-help can be beneficial regardless of whether or not you have a mental illness.<p>I would not recommend what I did:  I moved to a new city to take Masters-level CS courses as a non-matriculated student, with plans to apply to grad programs if it worked out.  It didn&#x27;t.  I failed miserably.  If you don&#x27;t have an interest in the professional work, it may transfer to academic work and further complicate a difficult transition.  The lack of social support and career network also shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.  Although switching gears and pursuing education may be exactly what you need, be aware of the risks.<p>Make a goal of building the life you want.  Don&#x27;t fret over sunk costs.  It&#x27;s not too late to start over or change direction, and your skills and experiences are likely to be valuable even in completely unrelated pursuits.  Best of luck!",1452460056

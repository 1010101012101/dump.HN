Comcast would inject forged TCP rst packets to inbound bittorrent connections. It did not send these packets to people running servers or other peer-to-peer protocols. In fact, people complained that the resets would sometimes prevent Windows Remote Desktop from working and Comcast adjusted their system to prevent it from jamming.<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/wp/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-affair"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/wp/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-af...</a><p>> I&#x27;m interested to know what other sorts of things/applications ISPs may be blocking.

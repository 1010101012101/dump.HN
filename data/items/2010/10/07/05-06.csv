Everyone thinks that every where I go and it's like a disease actually.  Macbook is absolutely worthless in terms of raw computing power.  You pay double and get a computer 1/2 the speed, but most people think you get a computer double the speed.  Simple example:  I got an i7 based pc at 4ghz that will out render any typical $1600 imac, or the $2000, or $2500 pro.  It cost $730.  I also work with video and audio in a studio etc.   I think the thing that irks me is every last macbook pro user tends to buy ssd first because they spend tons of cash easily.  But then they are always determined to say ""I use it on MY Macbook pro"".  To me this is not a sign of professionalism, but lack of understanding.  It's not like most will run final cut pro.  But most use adobe software anyway, which runs on windows 7 just fine.  And there are other alternatives about as good as fcp for windows 7.   Some of which are used to create very pro looking videos that have gotten famous on youtube.  Search cows cows cows. There are thousands of others.  But every last SSD review has some mac guy explaining how good the ssd works in a mac, lol.  But I will agree on part of this.  Mac's are typically slower, and their hard drives usually are terrible.  So, it makes sense I suppose.  And I know there are POS pc's.  But with a little shopping around and looking, you can buy stuff better than a mac for 1/2 th ecost.",1286431138

1766951,comment,1766900,1766900,0,0,dbingham,,,"The only way to learn how to program is to just do it.  Pick a language.  Start with small programs.  Learn the features and syntax of the language.  When you feel you know the language well enough to write a program that uses most of its features, then pick an open source program and learn its code.  Make some modifications to it.  When you feel you're pretty comfortable in one language, pick a new language.<p>Rinse repeat.  You'll find that once you have one language down, the process will go much faster with the second.  The features and syntax of most languages are pretty similar.<p>You can pick any language you like to start with, but personally I'd recommend starting with a hard typed compiled language rather than a dynamic language.  Dynamic languages are easy to learn, but its easy to be a lazy and bad programmer in them.  They let you get away with too much.  Hard typed compiled languages are a) much better at catching your errors and b) much harder to be a lazy programmer in.  They don't let you get away with things nearly as much.<p>I'd recommend Java, seems to be the language a lot of people start with.  It will also give you a good founding in open source programming.  I started with C/C++ and I'm glad I did.  But that was more of a challenge - had to learn pointers and memory management in my first language. And after that I took a little while to learn the open source mindset, since I'd started in a procedural language.<p>Once you have a good grasp of an object oriented language like Java (or Python) and what object oriented programming means, then I'd recommend reading the Gang of Four book on Design Patterns (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286429837&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Obje...</a>) and Martin Fowler's book on Refactoring (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286429884&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-...</a>).  Those will give you a pretty good basis in software design and maintenance.<p>In terms of recommended reading for learning a language, the O'Reilly books are nearly always good in my experience.  Here's one for Java (Learning Java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Java-Patrick-Niemeyer/dp/0596008732/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1286429947&sr=8-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Java-Patrick-Niemeyer/dp/0596...</a>) and here's one for Python (Learning Python: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/0596158068/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286430019&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Orient...</a>)",1286430140

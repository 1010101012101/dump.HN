5458205,comment,5457289,5457914,2,0,Kequc,,,"I think the major source of OPs discomfort at the conference was that she is surrounding herself with gamers. I'm just saying gamers spend time playing video games they could be spending interacting with other human beings, going out. Two things that many gamers significantly undervalue. So they get weird.<p>I mean I don't really know how else to put it. No group of grown ups standing around at a conference would notice the number of ""booth babes"" and then get upset. Something which happened to gamers a little while ago.<p>So a bunch of pretty girls who probably didn't like being there in those places very much to begin with lost their jobs. The hyper insecurity of attendees at these conferences and previously mentioned ""weirdness"" are contributors. Many, from my research of the opposition to ""booth babes"" are insecure that they are not regarded as adults due to ""booth babes"" being around. Even some people in this thread have stated that they don't like being marketed to as knuckle draggers.<p>Well. The gaming industry is largely populated by adolescents, that is why the marketing that is chosen gets chosen. If they were adult enough to not mind the presence of ""booth babes"" and just enjoy themselves at the conferences, investigating the technologies they are interested in things could be a lot better.<p>But they're not. Things are weird. Interactions are stressful and now marketers need to awkwardly conceal their attempts at marketing.",1364511379

And this is the result:<p>http://www.ep1x.com<p>Some of the more interesting features I've been able to custom program are as follows:<p>+ Automated and scalable contests.\n+ Proprietary currency.\n+ Store to spend currency in.\n+ Stripe payment integration to collect store's shipping costs.\n+ Bookmarklet to make posting images fast and easy.\n+ Twitter-like social networking tools and user profiles.\n+ Responsive site design.\n+ Commenting and reply system.\n+ Voting/Ranking system.\n+ EXIF data scraper.\n+ Multiple color themes.\n+ Custom browsing, sorting, and filtering.\n+ A ton of other stuff...<p>I'd love for HN to provide feedback and ask me questions about the development.  I'm also trying to get more people to contribute images because that's what makes the site have value.  If I could get only 10-20 people to regularly post images, then the site could entertain tens of thousands of people per day.<p>Thanks for checking out Ep1x and I look forward to your comments :]<p>Kevin Bikhazi",1364511344

5458196,comment,5457289,5458001,16,0,jmharvey,,,"The problem she described is a bit tougher to solve than simply saying, ""don't hire booth babes.""  ""[W]omen who are pretty but not models, dressed in normal street clothes"" describes a pretty big percentage of the general population.  Under her definition, ""If you have 'booth babes' ..., I'm not going to buy your product"" is essentially the same as saying ""If you have women selling your product, I'm not going to buy it,"" which isn't exactly an enlightened position to take.<p>The problem the OP faced was that people at the conference were generally sorting people into the general categories of ""technical and worth talking to"" or ""just trying to sell me something"" and would make the Bayesian inference that a random woman they came across was in the latter category.<p>I can see two solutions here, neither of which is very good:<p>1) In order to promote gender equality, everyone at a conference should avoid judging people based on their gender.  This would be ideal, but it's hard to fight casual statistical inference.<p>2) The conference could make sure that the people selling stuff at the booths and the people attending the conference have similar demographic profiles, so a random woman you encounter at the conference is as likely to be technical as a random man.  In practice, though, this would mean preferential hiring of men for the promotional jobs.<p>Really, we need an option (3) of ""get more women to be developers"" but that's hardly news, and not something that can be solved in short order.",1364511218

That is, does it make sense for me to invest in one or more children based on the expectation that those children will directly help me (financially and otherwise) during retirement?<p>I understand. I was pointing out what impact our national retirement policies had on individual incentives and how that translated into group incentives.<p>> However, as far as I know, it was always a program whose ethical justification was that you get back what you put in, plus some return. Whether or not you have children is irrelevant.<p>That's an abstraction. It doesn't matter if you only ""take out"" what you ""put in."" At the end of that day, somebody's kids are producing what you take out. Any retired generation inherently depends on the production of the working generation, and for a generation to retire, there has to <i>be</i> a working generation to take their place, which means having kids. Social security versus investing versus whatever is just a way of accounting for that basic transaction.<p>> Furthermore, if we presume that the ethical justification for social security is that one's children are going to be productive members of society, how can we adjust for unproductive children?<p>I'm speak at the group level. It's fairly irrelevant whether one person does or does not have kids, so it's useless to try and account for that at the level of Social Security. However, Social Security as an institution reduces the incentive for everyone to have kids, because they can just depend on the production of the kids of people who did. It's a free-rider problem.<p>> If social security is an intergenerational contract that involves a transfer of wealth from the young to the old, then it's an unjust Ponzi scheme that will collapse as soon as demographic trends are no longer able to sustain it.<p>It's a Ponzi scheme, but what makes it unjust? It's the circle of life, man. Your parents took care of you, and at the other end of the cycle you take care of them. The really useful insight is that it's a Ponzi scheme that's unavoidable, at least with existing technology. By and large, the human life is bookended by periods in which people are not self-sufficient and not able to produce. No matter how you abstract the underlying intergenerational transaction, you can't get away from it. We're engaging in the same intergenerational transaction people did tens of thousands of years ago--we just have a different, fancier way of accounting.",1364509180

Even Android projects are quite tricky to test despite Java having a strong heritage when it comes to unit testing.<p>Part of it just comes down to the way the GUI framework (whether it's Cocoa or Android) cuts across all aspects of the application, making it difficult to isolate individual components to test. Add to that a bunch of asynchronous code (which is almost always necessary when you start dealing with the database/network/filesystem) and you have something quite tricky to automate testing for.<p>Most of the server-side code I've dealt with has been an order of magnitude easier to test, but I think a lot of that comes down to the nature of their respective domains.",1364508149

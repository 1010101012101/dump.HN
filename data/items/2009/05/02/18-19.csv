590110,comment,589852,590027,0,0,tetha,,,"I think the point kind of is:\nIf the plain text password (which is reused on multiple sites) is sent out via email, then you need to compromise a single email in order to compromise many accounts.<p>If you want to abuse pasword-resetting mechanisms from N sites, you have to compromise N emails.<p>This means: mailing the password in plaintext might result in a lucky attacker seeing the password over your shoulder and then, he has access to a lot of stuff. If he just sees a password reset link, he has seen nothing.\nOf course, this includes compromising the account, because once the account is compromised, an arbitrary amount of emails is compromised (and thus, of course, also 1 email and N emails).",1241290143

590108,comment,589677,589855,0,0,ztzg,,,"There are quite a few similarities, but the design trade-offs are radically different:<p>* CrossTwine Linker is designed to be integrated into an existing language interpreter, without modifying its behavior besides improving execution performance.  Any other difference (including when dealing with source and binary C/C++ extensions) is probably a bug.<p>* Is is not a VM (nor a VM compiler), but rather a (constantly evolving) set of C++ engine pieces which can be adapted using “policy-based design.”  So while the demos aim to be generally fast, we can tune the engine and its adapters for any specific use-case; e.g.: you embed the Python interpreter in an application using the standard C API (no lock-in), and we make sure the binding behaves optimally with your application objects.  (Note: we can also implement the binding as part of the service.)<p>* As such, everything is pluggable—except that we only target native hardware (PyPy is much more ambitious).  But that's theory; I'll defer further comments on the backend to when we get the chance to implement a second one!<p>[Edit] Note that this means we support the full standard library—and all of its quirks—from day one.  Which is both a curse and a blessing, because it is written with interpreted execution in mind, but that can be improved as time passes.",1241290086

It uses SQLite for the datastore and supports searching of the clip history.<p>I agree with the parent; a clipboard manager is great for assembling information while minimizing context switches.  In particular, I've worked in environments offering rather limited screen real estate.  In those, Ditto helps keep me from overdosing on Alt-Tab.  It's also useful for parking ""I may need this"" snippets for longer term reference.  With the search facility, as long as I remember some aspect of the snippet, it's usually only a second or three away from my fingers.",1241289640

To use the fact that the category is new and most software is not designed for the screensize, usage pattern or hardware. It is difficult though, since they are not that extremely different. My vague ideas that haven't materialized to good ideas are:<p>* Design websites with the screensize in mind (dimensions as well as font sizes).\n* Overall focus on what _usage_ difference there is between netbooks and desktop computers.

590091,comment,589873,589873,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think this is a problem that is artificially inflated by the media.  It’s been possible to get pirated copies of movies long before anyone dreamed of bit torrent.  I remember going to New York as a kid and seeing obviously pirated films for sale right there on the street.<p>But the reason piracy has never managed to take down the media industry is quality.  Back in the days of VHS the videos were lousy copies obviously filmed from the back of the theatre while legit copies were of normal quality.  Now we have leaked torrent’s compressed to make the file size smaller against legit copies on Blu-Ray with crystal clear picture and surround sound.<p>So as long as Blu-Ray players continue to sell and Theater owners continue to upgrade their facilities I don’t see piracy doing any more damage than before.<p>Edit: One last point I forgot to make about how piracy has always been around.  Some in the media argue piracy is going up because it's so easy to download torrents.  To them I'd ask this: Is downloading a torrent any easier than renting a VHS video and copying it?",1241288978

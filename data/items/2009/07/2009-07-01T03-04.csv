I'm not sure that many places would hire someone, and then as them to re-design their account screen in their main application in the first week. And trust them to do a good job!",1246420591

A friend of mine had an Ilizarov frame for some 5 years at least (born with a shorter leg on one side, they were aiming for 4 inches I think) starting at age 10 or 11, and after seeing what an absolute mission that was for him, I'm staggered at the idea that someone would undergo that procedure for cosmetic reasons. It's seriously non-trivial surgery: installation was 13 hours, and he became far more familiar with various painkillers than any kid that age deserves to.",1246420066

682045,comment,681503,681585,0,0,zmimon,,,"I think it depends a lot on context.   There are some kinds of code where unit testing is just about the only way to test it at all and makes a huge amount of sense.   There are other situations where unit testing verges on being a complete waste of time.  One of those is that which the author describes, where you are writing what is essentially glue code between several large, complex components.  Your code is simple while the components are complex.   Mocking the complex components in order to test the simple code usually ends up having very low value to effort ratio.  Instead, a functional or integration test that verifies that all the components work together correctly is simpler to make and more useful in terms of the results it produces.",1246419200

10987849,comment,10986691,10987274,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"> Markets are totally broken but I hadn&#x27;t seen any legitimate players acknowledge that yet<p>That is one way to read the letter.  Another way to see it is that technical innovation has provided much cheaper ways to capture the value the hedge fund previously provided.  Between index funds that are a cheap way to capture macro gains and and algo funds as a cheap way to capture micro gains there just isn&#x27;t a reason to pay a hedge fund manager his 2 & 20.  I for one am <i>glad</i> about this, because that hedge fund managers profit came largely out of <i>my</i> (or some aggregate person much like me) pocket.<p>> HFT is providing liquidity, there really isn&#x27;t a situation where a &#x27;real&#x27; investor needs liquidity at the microsecond level<p>This is a common misstatement of the liquidity argument for HFT market makers.  The correct way to frame it is that HFT market makers can provide liquidity cheaper for a variety of factors:<p>1) cheaper infrastructure as it is much cheaper to get a machine at an exchange than a person in a pit.<p>2) more efficient quoting as a computer can quote thousands of markets while a person can quote a half dozen.<p>3) less risk which is the crux of the argument for speed.  To a market maker (HFT or otherwise) the risk they are trying mitigate is the risk presented by hedge funds and other large block orderers.  Those large blocks will move the price of the market (that is in fact how the large block orderer captures profit, the information imbalance they have at the beginning of the order compared to the end).  Historically some of that profit came out of the market makers pocket, so they had to price every trade higher to account for it. It has always been a cat and mouse game between market makers and hedge funds.  Now HFT is better at recognizing and reacting to these large block orders meaning the market maker can price less risk into all of their quotes.<p>> an average investor might not make much money in the market if they started putting money in now.<p>One of the very nice things about our markets is that they will actually reward you handsomely if you take that opinion and turn it into action.",1453985787

The colored mazes are the universal UI widget but many of them are switchboards that control the environment in the game in ways typical to 3d puzzlers (turning on lights, moving platforms, aligning objects.)<p>Many of the puzzles are the sort of abstract logic puzzles you&#x27;d see in an IQ test or mobile game, but most of them revolve around paying close attention to your environment and seeing it in different ways. I&#x27;d love to describe a few of them, but wouldn&#x27;t want to spoil the moments of euphoria from noticing them yourself.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the game starts with some of the more abstract ones, because the real joy lies elsewhere in the game, but I would say that if you don&#x27;t enjoy an abstract intellectual challenge you probably won&#x27;t enjoy it.",1453985577

For comparison, Linux is between 0.5% and 1.0%. Most Macs are laptops with Intel GPU which are simply too weak for most current games. The Mac OpenGL drivers have a legendary reputation for being crap since they are controlled by Apple, not the GPU makers (although, native Intel GL drivers are not much better). Sometimes the reason is simply that the additional required customers support for Mac costs money and thus the development effort can&#x27;t be justified.<p>I&#x27;m a daily Mac user and like it pretty much, but for games I also have a proper PC, attached to the TV.

If you want to get feedback or other details(like address) during conversation, you can easily send the form from the admin zone and your customer will see the form on the left of the chat panel. You can see the submission live and respond accordingly.<p>Some features it has * your own chatpage.co/your_business or custom domain * get links that enable certain forms before the conversation, to include in emails or other websites * easy-to-use form builder * export submitted data as excel/pdf * view data as charts for analysis * email fallback when you are offline * 8 themes, customize over 50 attributes(from background image to fonts and colors)<p>At this stage, feedback is critical so I appreciate any thought you have about this.

Everyone \n  would just have two numbers in their bank account, for each of the country&#x27;s two \n  official currencies. Basic income would be paid in one, while all income from \n  trade in the economy would be in the other.\n</code></pre>\nI think this would be bad, as you limit a persons ability to choose and as such you&#x27;re limiting freedom by government planning. Basically as was described by F. A. Hayek in his book &quot;The Road To Serfdom&quot;:<p><i>… that in a planned society &quot;political democracy can remain if it confines itself to all but economic matter&quot;. Such assurances are usually accompanied by the suggestion that by giving up freedom in what are, or ought to be, the less important aspects of our lives, we shall obtain greater freedom in the pursuit of higher values. On this ground people who abhor the idea of a political dictatorship often clamour for a dictator in the economic field.<p>The arguments used appeal to our best instincts and often attract the finest minds. If planning really did free us from the less important cares and so made it easier to render our existence one of plain living and high thinking, who would wish to belittle such an ideal? If our economic activities really concerned only the inferior or even more sordid sides of life, of course we ought to endeavour by all means to find a way to relieve our- selves from the excessive care for material ends, and, leaving them to be cared for by some piece of utilitarian machinery, set our minds free for the higher things of life.<p>Unfortunately the assurance people derive from this belief\nthat the power which is exercised over economic life is a power\nover matters of secondary importance only, and which makes\nthem take lightly the threat to the freedom of our economic\npursuits, is altogether unwarranted. It is largely a consequence of the erroneous belief that there are purely economic ends separate from the other ends of life. Yet, apart from the pathological case of the miser, there is no such thing. The ultimate ends of the activities ofreasonable beings are never economic. Strictly speaking there is no &quot;economic motive&quot; but only economic factors conditioning our striving for other ends.<p>What in ordinary language is misleadingly called the &quot;economic motive&quot; means merely the desire for general opportunity, the desire for power to achieve unspecified ends. If we strive for money it is because it offers us the widest choice in enjoying the fruits of our efforts. Because in modern society it is through the limitation of our money incomes that we are made to feel the restrictions which our relative poverty still imposes upon us, many have come to hate money as the symbol of these restrictions. But this is to mistake for the cause the medium through which a force makes itself felt. It would be much truer to say that money is one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented by man. It is money which in existing society opens an astounding range of choice to the poor man, a range greater than that which not many generations ago was open to the wealthy.</i>",1453983113

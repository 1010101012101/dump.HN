I&#x27;d love, for example, there be standard physical mounts for cameras and sensors, in front and tail lights, above the rearview, in wheel arches, and a data backplane. One of these, plus a display, would make a nice in car entertainment hub, and barely use the GPU abilities, which could switch to cams, or alert me to tire wear, or even ground condition. If connected to a ECU (regs ahead, sure, but..) you might damp steering input to deal, with camber, or unload the suspension at a corner if a object looked like a puncture risk. Maybe someone should make aftermarket lamp assemblies that accommodate bullet style cams. Would take some handy optical calculations. I think automotive sensing needs a boost for collecting data by affording accommodation to such retrofits, without causing people to do hardware mods, that are likely needing certification or plain ugly, and make a supplier alliance for anonymized data. Opt in, I hope, as nobody&#x27;s done a good job of instilling trust much, but i&#x27;d go for it. As for Internet of Things ideas, driver driven vehicles might be able to broadcast data useful for driverless cars. The need is for retrofitting cars as much as hoping new models will sell, as this is the sort of thing that I imagine would be a option. Make it part of something people want, like strong GPU for mapping, and you might have a deal.",1407257787

Some of these CAPTCHA farms claim to be solving 700,000 CAPTCHA&#x27;s per day (according to the NYT article), which equates to roughly $500 per day in profit, or $15,000 per month, or $180,000 per year.<p>According to Wikipedia [7], a wage of 45 cents per hour is higher than the minimum wage in 40 countries where the number is listed, and more than double the minimum wage in more than 12 countries.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m divided. People are clearly using these services, and many of them are working from home, not from a sweatshop as many people imagine (although I&#x27;m sure those places exist). That means conditions must be &quot;somewhat&quot; tolerable. In some countries (like the dozen with a minimum wage under 20 cents per hour), a wage of $0.45/hr could actually be really good.<p>Of course, then there&#x27;s the issue of spam. Personally I see that as ethically orthogonal to the labor issues here, since it almost exclusively affects &quot;first world&quot; people, and hardly in any meaningful way.

I&#x27;m posting this here in the hopes of generating discussion about a pretty important topic.<p>A few sites exist specifically for breaking CAPTCHA&#x27;s. These are known as &quot;CAPTCHA farms&quot; [1][2]. You can find a bunch of them on Google, but a few examples are DeathByCaptcha [3] and ImageDecoders [4]. These two sites charge about $1.35 per 1000 solved CAPTCHA&#x27;s.<p>This is a relatively well known industry, but most of the articles I&#x27;ve seen only talk about the <i>demand</i> side of the market. Nobody has bothered to find the sites paying the suppliers to type the CAPTCHA&#x27;s. So today I did a little bit of research and was able to find one.<p>MegaTypers [5] pays its users to solve CAPTCHA&#x27;s. Signing up is kind of difficult because you need to track down an invitation code, so I took some screenshots and put them in an album for anyone interested, including pricing table, CAPTCHA entry, and statistics board. [6]<p>When typing CAPTCHA&#x27;s, I was limited by the speed they were offered to me (hence the ability to buy &quot;boost packs,&quot; I presume). In 60 seconds, I was able to type 12 CAPTCHA&#x27;s, 11 of them accurately. Assuming I sustained this rate for an hour, I would type roughly 700 CAPTCHA&#x27;s.<p>Assuming average price of $0.65/1000 (it varies by hour), I would earn 45 cents. In an 8 hour day, that&#x27;s $3.60.<p>CAPTCHA farms are making a profit of roughly $500 per day.<p>I&#x27;m wondering: What does the (largely libertarian) userbase of HN think of this?<p>Note: I ran into the character limit, so will post more in a comment.<p>[1] http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/technology/26captcha.html?_r=0<p>[2] http://arstechnica.com/security/2008/09/captchas-flummox-bots-but-may-be-doomed-by-captcha-farmers/<p>[3] http://deathbycaptcha.com/<p>[4] http://www.imagedecoders.com<p>[5] http://www.megatypers.com/<p>[6] http://imgur.com/a/QevOc<p>[7] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country",1407257514

Therefore, I always like to explain the &quot;progress + preservation&quot; view whenever describing type safety, because it illustrates the term really has a pretty precise meaning at least in the simple cases.<p>In the simplest case, think of your &#x27;interpreter&#x27; as a program that translates programs into values. For example, 1 is a value and \\x.x+1 (the lambda expression) is a value, but (\\x.x+1)1 is not a value because it evaluates to 2 (or, at least, to 1+1).<p>Let&#x27;s say that your interpreter does this a single small step at a time; so for instance, if you have* f(x,y) = x+y, then f(1,2) |--> (x + 2)(1) |--> (1+2) |--> 3.<p>Type safety goes like this: If x has type T then either x |--> x&#x27; or x is a value. Also, if x has type T and x |--> x&#x27; then x&#x27; also has type T.<p>The first property is &quot;well-typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong&quot; and the second property closes a loophole (&quot;if you&#x27;re a well-typed program, then you&#x27;re never going to evaluate to anything that isn&#x27;t also well-typed&quot;, so we never escape from the first property by evaluating)<p>* using the product syntax because some people will get confused by f 1 2, but that&#x27;s in fact what I mean.",1407255841

(Venus is too close to the Sun.)<p>There&#x27;s only a finite number of possible, reasonable-duration sequences of Earth and Mars flybys to try, so you just get a computer and try them all. Once you pick a sequence (e.g. EEMEC), you scan across a range of launch dates, maybe incrementing by half a day…<p>Okay, so now we&#x27;ve picked out a flyby sequence and a launch date. Next up is to pick the date of the first flyby. You can scan across those in half-day increments too.<p>Once you pick the launch date and the first flyby date, you treat the leg as a two-body problem. You know the initial position vector, the final position vector, and the leg duration: it&#x27;s a &quot;Lambert Problem.&quot; Typically, there&#x27;s only a finite number of solutions, so you just try them all (or all the reasonable ones, anyway).<p>(Aside: In this mission, the first transfer was a one-year Earth-Earth transfer. It was a &quot;resonant transfer&quot;: there&#x27;s actually an infinite number of ways to do those, but the set of ways is topologically equivalent to the surface of a sphere, so you just try a finite number of points on that sphere. I digress.)<p>In preliminary mission design, you just treat the gravity-assist flybys as instantaneous kicks to the spacecraft (instantaneous Delta-V maneuvers).<p>Next up, we pick the date of the second flyby. Again you can scan across all those in half-day steps or whatever. Once you pick that date, you now have another Lambert problem for the second leg. It&#x27;s handled the same way as with the first leg, only there&#x27;s an added complication:<p>Once we&#x27;ve got the first and second leg transfer orbits selected, we can ask the required flyby altitude at the first flyby. If it&#x27;s below the surface of the planet, then that particular second leg is a no-go, and we can stop considering it.<p>And so on. Eventually we end up at the destination. The trajectory model is just a bunch of conic sections (solutions to the two-body problem) patched together at the gravity assists (which have no extent in time or space). It&#x27;s a &quot;patched conic trajectory.&quot;<p>What if the spacecraft does a Delta-V maneuver at some point? Yes, that&#x27;s common, but it&#x27;s also just a few more free parameters, so just throw them into the bag and try a bunch…<p>Most of the time is spent just trying all the possible combinations. Each individual trajectory takes almost no time to calculate.<p>Once you have a bunch of candidate trajectories, you can just compare them using whatever metrics matter, e.g. final mass at the target body, total mission duration, does it pass any interesting objects? And so on.<p>Often there are constraints to satisfy as well. For example, operations people don&#x27;t like it when maneuvers happen on the other side of the Sun from where the Earth currently is, because they can&#x27;t communicate with the spacecraft at that time: the Sun is in the way.<p>Once a preliminary trajectory design (or set of designs) has been chosen, one can simulate a more detailed model (e.g. one that adds the gravity of Jupiter), but the overall trajectory architecture doesn&#x27;t change.",1407255829

One of many books he&#x27;s written in the galaxy-spanning setting of &quot;The Culture&quot;, an anarchist techno-utopia. Everyone who likes the Culture has an opinion about the best one to start reading with; this is mine. He&#x27;s also written many SF books outside that setting, and many non-SF books as &#x27;Iain Banks&#x27;. Sadly he died recently so there will never be any more.<p>The Quantum Thief, Hannu Rajaniemi. An ultra-dense draught of future shock; a thief pulls off a complicated caper in a Solar System transformed into something alien and strange by Moore&#x27;s Law.<p>The Laundry Files, Charlie Stross. A series about a computer programmer who works for a secret arm of England&#x27;s intelligence agency dedicated to fighting off magical menaces. Each book stands alone but the end of the world is looming on the horizon. Stross has written a LOT more stuff, pretty much all worth reading IMHO.<p>The Lies of Locke Lamora, Scott Lynch. A very witty romp about a thief in a fantasy land. There&#x27;s three books about Locke now; while there&#x27;s continuity between them, they mostly stand alone - right now I&#x27;m reading the latest, where he has to rig an election for a council of wizards, while an old flame does the same for the other side.<p>Bridge of Birds, Barry Hughart. The first of three gorgeous fantasy detective novels set in magical medieval China. Find them, read them, possibly love them.<p>The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter, Michael Swanwick. A changeling&#x27;s journey through a mad steampunk version of UK fairy myth. Utterly gorgeous and beautiful, also profoundly alien and nihilistic. Not my absolute favorite of his works - that honor goes to Stations of the Tide - but this one&#x27;s a very close runner-up.<p>Also seconding the recommendation elsewhere in this thread for Gene Wolfe&#x27;s Book of the New Sun series. Huge and dense and slow and beautiful and absolutely in love with language. I couldn&#x27;t get into the two subsequent Books of the Long/Short Suns, but the New Sun is amazing.<p>Oh and of course George R. R.

Lets just hope it doesnt suffer the fate of Cuil.<p>All joking aside, I'm really excited to begin playing with this and exploring the possibilities of a live web inference engine. I'm anxious to see what kind of API/developer tools will be provided, and (since it's Mathematica) whether there will be any cost involved. Has anyone seen this discussed anywhere?",1237297817

Unfortunately, its probably only one of the first of its kind, something I expect to see quite a bit more of in the near future.<p>With Google's recent layoffs, and some of the more fluff applications being removed, I can only imagine its a matter of time until other things start getting cut to save on costs. When they start closing, all the applications people have built on top of them will have to collapse, and there will be far more complaints like this.<p>On another note, how on earth did that get through the App Store? Did apple really approve an application that let you send free SMS messages, when so much profit is made by the telephone companies off of them?",1237297072

If A gives $1 to B and B gives $1 to C, there is no fee. If C cashes out, we remove our fee and any overhead of moving money in and out of the system. The worst case overhead ends up being a fraction of the overhead of just using paypal.<p>We have already seen lots of P2P usage of this (paying for coffee or gifting a beer for a friend), and heavy use in microgiving donations to non-profits.

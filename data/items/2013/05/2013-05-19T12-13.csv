Since there will apparently only ever be 21 million (and that by 2040), he has a disproportionate amount of the currency that will ever exist. Not everybody wants to be outed as having over $100million, but that probably pales in comparison to what could hypothetically happen if somebody/an organisation wanted to destroy the currency. He could probably single handedly do it and would be a very obvious target.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4295028/report-satoshi-nakamoto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4295028/report-satoshi-naka...</a><p>EDIT: Added the source I forgot.

I don't know much about Erlang's history beyond what is on Wikipedia, but I suspect that the number of people that used Erlang before it was open source was relatively small and limited to the technical community within Ericsson. That small, focused user group explains the language's weird and weirdly antiquated style and feature set, but it doesn't quite explain why the language has not been evolved to become more modern. (Of course, the fact that something as ingenious could come out of such a small community is also very impressive and wonderful.)",1368968288

Plenty of other mining products produce a side stream of uranium, which can be utilized.<p>In larger picture these side streams don't matter much. What happens in Kazakhstan's (36% of all U production), Canada's and Australia's uranium mines does. They account for 64% of global uranium production.  Australia has 23% of the world's uranium deposits, CAN 12%, KAZ 10%.<p>About 85% of current needs are met with digging, 15% comes from secondary sources.<p>It's interesting that two of the biggest producers of uranium do not utilize nuclear energy themselves.

5732735,comment,5731693,5732657,2,0,VLM,,,"""don't know if it is true though""<p>Well you see there's design, like I designed a giant spacecraft when I was a kid, all on one piece of paper, and then I talked to people about it because I thought it was cool, and there's ""really design"" like handling mfgr issues, clearance/fit/wear issues, failure tolerance, etc.  Thats how my spacecraft only took one side of one piece of paper but the Cessna I took lessons in had about six linear feet of shelf space for the A+P manuals for all the different parts and subsystems thats just enduser maintenance stuff, not actual design docs.  I haven't watched the video, but my guess is the kid doesn't have a design of his own.  If a design of a real reactor takes 1000 engineer-years from the best minds in the field, and the kid is not that old yet...<p>I've had kind of a nuclear interest for quite a bit longer than the kid's been alive.  Its an interesting hobby, seeing how much you can learn.  As a hobby its no weirder than seeing how much you can learn about the phone system, or the internet.<p>The fundamental problem we're discussing is balancing optimum nuclear characteristics (neutron activation, long life, capture cross section, etc), mechanical/chemical/safety/lifespan properties, and mfgr/supply issues, can never really optimize all three at the same time.<p>The Lucens reactor local optimization maxima for fuel cladding (the tube/shell the fuel sits in) ended up as Magnesium.  Get it hot enough and it burns spectacular in pretty much anything, CO2, air, water...  Also it corrodes pretty well underwater, or heck even in air.  So burying a super flammable fuel underground and heating it up isn't so wise in retrospect although I'm sure as a local maxima it looked like a good idea.  If we lived on an oxygen free planet then Magnesium would be quite a handy general purpose metal.  Unfortunately on the earth...<p>Other popular fuel cladding over the years for gas reactors has been stuff like beryllium (WTF were they thinking?) and stainless steel.<p>I suppose the guys who selected Mg for cladding did pat themselves on their backs for not using a Be based cladding, which is probably the only way it could have turned out worse.<p>Needless to say, stainless steel in CO2 doesn't burn very well.  Maybe that's the kids design, its certainly off the shelf and fairly conventional.  Lifespan might be shorter, ruinous cost, and the worst part is stainless eats neutrons for dinner which aside from making a short life means huge waste of fuel and heating issues, its kind of like storing your fuel inside shielding crazy as that sounds.  But as a local optimization its not bad for mfgr safety as stainless is pretty harmless (Your cafeteria is contaminated with stainless steel, oh noes!) and the flammability rating of stainless steel in CO2 atmosphere is as you'd guess pretty excellent.<p>Why all this fooling with cladding?  Fundamentally nuke fuel seems to be awful structurally so you shove it into a pipe.  Engineers are pretty cool with making heat exchangers outta pipes so a magic pipe that generates its own heat is pretty well understood.  Its an object oriented encapsulation idea, sorta.  If you made an indestructible fuel that didn't need cladding, then you'd either have wear issues on whatever it touches and/or processing/reprocessing would be terribly difficult dangerous and expensive and contamination issues so you'd just be moving the location of the accident, not reducing the rate of accidents.",1368968030

So much fun! Everything was optimized and fast. Like Flash-fast!

5732712,comment,5732472,5732603,5,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> <i>it certainly is not designed for that usecase.</i><p>That's a misleading statement, I think; it's like saying Python was not designed for web application development (which is true but also misleading).<p>It's more correct to say that Erlang was designed without much thought given to string processing. Erlang was designed as a fairly general-purpose language, only one with non-encoding-aware strings; the real problem is that it hasn't caught up, even though Unicode has existed since 1991 and has long been incorporated into most languages and most software by now.<p>Instead of adapting, Erlang seems to be stagnating in one area that users are frequently complaining about. In this day and age, I would argue that string processing is quite important for the things that Erlang can, or should, be used for.<p>Anecdotally, when I first tried Erlang I tried to create a naive, parallel log processor which read lines and spawned off lines to a pool of workers. As a newbie I was quickly stumped because Erlang's file I/O is abysmally designed. I eventually gave up the project, and later I found that Tim Bray, also an Erlang noob, had struggled with the exact same issue [1][2]. You would think that this is something Erlang would excel at, but apparently it's not.<p>I have been disappointed with Haskell's string support, too -- it's all over the place (String vs. Text types, the weird Data.Encoding module, horrible regexp library, etc.)  -- but at least it's fully Unicode-aware and it has a fast ByteString type.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/22/Erlang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/22/Erlang</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Erlang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Erlang</a>",1368967307

In addition as far as I understand PNaCl has its own triple which parks down some things like endinaness and pointers size etc. which make IR much more portable.<p>> You could implement asm.js in the exact same way. There's nothing stopping you from doing that.<p>Yes, I don't argue you cannot keep evolving JS to be closer to real bytecode, I'm just arguing this in my opinion is not the right way to go. And moreover I think it will fail. People tried retrofit JVM to be bytecode for C/C++ too, and where has this efforts lead?<p>In contrast LLVM IR /is already/ IR for C/C++. In its full form it's a compiler IR but making it more stable and portable seem like much smaller task than retrofitting all featuers needed for native execution onto JS.<p>> I have not verified the PNaCl performance numbers, but I would be surprised if they counted compilation time. The asm.js performance benchmarks do count compilation time. So I suspect the apples-to-apples gap is actually much smaller.<p>Compilation time matters only the first time app is run, Google said. If you have a game or large application, you run it more than once. Since their compilation generates native binary, they just need to load it next time so it's 0 compilation time. I don't know how their first time compilation will compare to asm.js but all subsequent ones are likely better.",1368966132

It's probably not worth the sacrifice in convenience <i>if</i> performance was your main reason for going the static generated route.<p>I can't speak to the argument from uptime as I haven't used shared hosting in a while. Using an edge cache (without S3) might give you a little help there, as it only needs to hit your shared hosting on cache expiry, but that obviously won't be as safe as statically generating the files and making CF read them out of S3.<p>I think S3 behind CF is a perfectly good approach. I was just saying that if you've currently got a dynamically generated site and are considering moving to static generation because of performance alone, the trade-off probably isn't worth the effort.<p>I wouldn't advise you personally to go back on that decision at all, especially because of the issues you've seen with uptime.<p>> I think my assumption was S3 did have edge locations<p>I think you get this from the rest of my comments but just to be clear: I've only ever experienced bad download times from S3 and would not feel comfortable recommending that you use it to serve traffic directly from the internet.

- your high bid give you a boost of trust in the eyes of the client
- your future client will respect you more ( it's psychology , if you pay more for a thing, you will valuate it more )
- you will want to work with people that have this mentality<p>To make sure that this will work for you, try to post some jobs in your field, study the competition and make sure that your bids ( proposals ) looks much better and you are really doing a good job compared with them .<p>If you have more questions, you can reach me at : ionut.neagu[[at]]vertistudio.com",1368965648

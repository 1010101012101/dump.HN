This applies to C as well.<p>As much as newer languages come about, in the end, you are working with a Von Neumann machine, of which both C and C++ are well suited for.<p>The only problem with C++ as far as I can tell is that you need to know a lot, not to make mistakes. There are too many ways to do things, that if you don't know what you are doing, you are probably going to do things wrong. However, once you _do_ know, and use libraries like Boost, I think it is difficult to come up with a reason why not to use C++ for lower level programming, with performance requirements.",1336730364

3958460,comment,3955146,3956595,3,0,harshreality,,,"We pay for lots of services that only other people end up using.  It's part of being in a society.<p>When something is reasonably considered optional, ideally and hopefully you aren't forced to pay for other people's partaking of that optional service.<p>Healthcare is not one of those things.  It's optional in the sense that everyone has the option of refusing medical care, even if sometimes that means dying, but it's not optional in that almost every sane person with more than a minor cut or sniffles or food poisoning opts for medical care if it is available rather than the alternative.<p>Other mandatory goods and services, like food, clothing, housing, city utilities (water/electricity), even internet access, work better in a mostly private model for a couple major reasons.  First, the price variance for the necessary part of those goods and services is very low compared to variance for the medical costs someone might incur.  Second, a lot of people can afford and want more than the bare necessities.  Not so with medical care, where few people can afford major surgery or routine treatments for some major chronic conditions.<p>Another aspect of medical care is that we benefit even if we're never treated.  Do you know anyone who has ever needed significant medical care at a hospital?  I doubt your relationship with those people means nothing to you.",1336730293

People that can sell your vision and convince the audience that the problem you're solving is the biggest issue their business faces. They're completely indispensable.

Sometimes they're good questions like how would i solve problem X using X language, because thats relevant, i think its a good question.<p>However, i hate when i get questions like ""how many golf balls can you get in a double decker bus"" and ""whats your most embarrassing moment"", both of these were questions i was actually asked in an interview. My answer to the first was ""I dont know and i'm not going to try and work it out because 1) i dont have enough information and 2) its not relevant to this position. I'd happily answer hypothetical questions about situations that could plausibly come up during this position, but working out number of golf balls in a bus doesnt show you how i would solve the problem of the database running slow or validation checks not working correctly."" For the second one i simply answered ""I have never been embarrassed in a professional setting as i mainly just do my job and i'm not embarrassed to say 'I dont know' or to ask for help. The only times i've been embarrassed were in my personal life and those are stories not appropriate for an interview.""<p>Needless to say, these were questions asked by the CEO of a startup i thought was absolutely amazing, i had sat through a tech interview with the CTO before the CEO came in and felt i did well with the tech questions. Once the CEO came in and asked me these questions, i wondered how an awesome startup was achieving this success behind the leadership of total and utter moron.

Every application (which I want to be able to drop all the db and recreate it) has to run it's own riak cluster.<p>Initially I thought that ""buckets"" were intended to solve this problem, but buckets don't map to a separate storage location, it's just a way to group items. Even listing all buckets present in the db requires scanning all keys and, as the doc says, ""Similar to the list keys operation, this requires traversing all keys stored in the cluster and should not be used in production.""<p>Although I've been told that ""riak is not designed to do this and that"", I'm not sure if these limitations are really technical, or just because the product development effort was targeted at some of the aspects, and these issues could be addressed in a later stage.<p>Any idea?",1336729641

3958424,comment,3957314,3958345,3,0,its_so_on,,,"mcteapot, please realize that people are a mix of lots of different preferences and motivations.  I think we can all agree that on the whole, when management says you will get $10k for a certain action, it means that they expect this helps more people do the action.  That doesn't mean it's the only reason they do it, or that some of the people who do it after the bonus wouldn't have done it without the bonus.  It just means it helps.  Otherwise, if it doesn't help, why not call it a thank-you-for-not-parking-in-the-handicapped-space-when-you-shouldn't bonus (assuming that, like most companies, nobody happens to have any problem with not doing this, and at any given time either the handicapped spaces are empty or employees with a legitimate entitlement are using them) and give it to every employee equally?  I mean, if you don't expect it to have any effect whatsoever on referrals/behavior...<p>Also, I want to make a nuanced but important point here.  The employer in this particular case is explicitly kind of saying, ""yeah, it might have kind of helped at the time, but you're not working here anymore.""  By that logic, every single person who ever gives notice should have their last paycheck docked if the time to cut the check occurs after they have left.  After all, even though the paycheck might have originally helped them work there, they're not working there anymore so that doesn't matter.  Why should an employer ever pay the last paycheck?  You're not part of the team anymore and the paycheck is meant to motivate employees to work, that's why it exists.  ""Also, you dropped the database"", or some made-up excuse.<p>I think we can all agree that people don't just work for money, but we can also all agree that every employer needs to pay the last paycheck, even if the time to pay it comes after the employee has left.  To me, per my comment that you replied to, the fact that the database thing was brought up means the employer is trying to squirm out of settling a debt; rather than say that it wasn't a real debt.",1336729395

Have fun!",1336727152

Perhaps it's possible that the OS could somehow manipulate that to implement threads that are not as heavyweight as ""common"" threads, but I'm not aware of any OS that does that. Threads are the only multiprocessing abstraction provided by the CPU and the OS (although now there are some new abstractions for GPUs).",1336727145

It works really well in Chrome/Safari, okay in Firefox, and not at all in the lower-end stuff.<p>You can use the keyboard to go back and forth between steps.<p>We don't offer a HTML5 game engine yet, but we'll build one if we need to.

No mention of no longer needing insulin, or their pancreas magically repairing itself.  Nothing that would make the device in the OP substantially less helpful.<p>This is all hardly a surprise, because plant-based diets tend to be low in refined carbohydrates, large quantities of which make diabetes harder to manage.  People have achieved similar effects eating lots of other diets that aren't too high in carb (and this is, indeed, one area where mainstream science on the subject is in the process of updating itself).<p>Please, tell me of the people with type 1 diabetes who have had their condition reversed by a change in diet.  I'd genuinely love it if it were true, but it's not.  It's complete BS.<p>By the way, calling something 'mainstream' when it comes to medicine is not the insult you seem to think it is.  It generally means 'credible people have performed studies with a credible methodology, and they have found stuff out'.  You'll have to forgive me if I don't find anecdotes on the internet a particularly compelling alternative.<p>This is not to say that fringe opinions are all bad - occasionally one of those opinions will be right, the mainstream will be wrong, and the mainstream will be updated.  Usually, though, we try to have some kind of credible evidence before stating wild leaps as fact - because most of these fringe opinions are wrong.",1336726990

Stuff like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope were very cool, and it's good to see more frameworks and libraries for taking some of the effort out of it and making it more mass-market.<p>One thing that excites me especially is that a simple game creation engine in the browser might be a great chance to excite kids about programming with a very low barrier to entry.",1336726909

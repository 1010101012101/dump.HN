10392600,comment,10390062,10392035,0,0,matt_s,,,"Insourcing is what is happening at some large global Fortune 500 companies.  Essentially this is doing away with H-1B visas and establishing your own IT center offshore or rather on a different shore than your HQ.  Massive money savings by doing this.<p>The way this should operate for software development is to have people at or near HQ that are the key roles - software architecture, project managers, requirements analysts and software development leads or managers.  Then at your Asia branch (India most likely) you would staff up managers, software developers, etc. in a center where they can deliver things that are tightly aligned to your companies strategy instead of aligning to some legal contract.<p>In software terms: insourcing is a tightly coupled mutually beneficial interface, outsourcing is going through a facade owned by two legal teams.",1444910388

Like 4 or 10 hours long. Parks is not an option for that. While backroads are awesome. Once out of town, I usually meet a car once in a while. And while in town and suburbia, I guess I can qualify as A to B commuter. Even out of town, sometimes it&#x27;s sort of A to B commute, because I want to go to some sightseeing spot or fancy cafe in the woods or smth. I just happen to cycle instead of drive. Or sometimes I dispatch my family in a car and go by bicycle myself. It&#x27;s still A-to-B, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Saying what is and what is not a &quot;proper road use&quot; is a very slippery slope. Is it OK to drive to get to a grocery store? Is it OK to drive to some spot in the middle of nowhere for sightseeing? Is it OK to drive for few hours to bbq in an unseen place? Is it OK to drive to go fishing in a nicer lake instead of the one nearby? Is it OK to drive to see friends if you can video call them instead?",1444910379

This to me is the intent for the devops organizational style - your developers have full visibility and responsibility into seeing their code through the entire cycle of existence and can quickly fix and prevent problems better than split teams. While most software developers tend to be terrible operations engineers and vice versa, I&#x27;m quite sure that well-written software makes operations work far, far easier and thus makes O&S much cheaper as a result.<p>Also, a lot of companies opt to use Heroku first then migrate to basic ol&#x27; AWS once that gets far too expensive for them and may hire an operations engineer or two to replace the cost and to help them scale better with capital.<p>NoOps in a very literal sense being used to describe tech operations is something I never think I&#x27;ll see anyone take seriously and that can scale.",1444909019

That means there&#x27;s a raw USB SDK out there, and adding HID keyboard support wouldn&#x27;t be too hard (no kernel driver development etc).<p>Getting passwords into the device would be nontrivial; Palm keyboards are proprietary to the series they were made for, with a few arbitrary connector updates thrown in for good measure (think iPhone docking connector saga). If the password is irritating enough to repeatedly type on a full keyboard, it would take you a good 5 minutes (and a punching bag, for afterwards) to get it into the PDA, Graffiti and custom keyboards taken into account.<p>I think it would work out though: if the only way to get data out of the device is to tap something on its screen, that should be enough of a brick wall to dissuade would-be attackers.<p>I guess I&#x27;m responding to this so enthusiastically because it&#x27;s about Palm :P - I unfortunately never owned one of these awesome little things, but I&#x27;d love something of similar capabilities built using today&#x27;s tech.

I cannot, until today, grasp any imperial unit intuitively. Every time I encounter one of those strange things I have to convert (painful even with Google) or else I wouldn't get it. Imperial units are just gibberish to me. I guess this would be the same if it were the other way round.<p>I don't get your point about convenience. Sure, there might be some minor things that work a bit better in imperial (or not, I don't think your examples are that convincing), but compared to the cost of learning two systems (you have to, for school and science - that must be a pain, I'm happy I never had to do this) this is minor stuff. Also: I don't really know, but I would think that science class would be much harder if you are unable to intuitively grasp the units.<p>I would guess that you are locked into your system.

If we (developers who rely on open source software) can afford to compromise and parlay with the enemy now (and make no mistake, before rms got pissed at the path software development was taking and took it upon himself to start a one-man war on behalf of all of us, proprietary software <i>was</i> an enemy), it is because the movement has gained sufficient momentum and become too strong to destroy.<p>I mean, imagine the reaction of a pragmatic person to the decline of the hacker culture at MIT's AI lab, where it all started.

How much code do you really write before you check to see if something works? You're almost certainly doing <i>something</i>.  Maybe it's just a small main program where you validate that some methods are giving you the output you expected, or maybe it's a simple web form that you populate with mock data to verify it's persisting to a database.  Unless you wait until the entire functionality is ready before a trial run (and if you're doing exploratory coding, there's no such thing as ""ready"" anyway), you are writing <i>something</i> to test during iterations.<p>Instead of throwing these tests away, keep them somewhere and run them periodically.  If they break, figure out why - and either fix the code, or change the test.  When you're done, you'll have a bunch of unit tests.<p>(just a quick note - the process I described above works extremely well for some situations, but poorly for others.  Some frameworks make it a real hassle to write unit tests.  The process I described also is <i>not</i> TDD, it's more of a write a little, test a little approach, which feels more natural to me.  I also don't really like to use TDD, especially for exploratory coding).",1254844417

At best, you get to decide when to walk away, let go, and get back to your business if your lucky enough that its still viable after all the energy and money you put into the fight.<p>Courts do not decide to ""accept a suit"".  A judge acts on ""evidence"" presented by each side, they do not provide their own advice or due diligence in the case.  A plaintiff files and the other side defends.  Both sides immediately assume costs.  If the court does throw the case out for lack of standing, jurisdiction, or other preliminary matter, ok, the defendant ""won"" that round, but you don't get your money or time back.  If you want your money back, you have to either counter sue or petition for it.  This puts more time and money at risk.<p>Its a very tough call to decide when to give up or fight.  This guy made the decision that his name was not the most important aspect of his business and decided not to fight very early.  I think he acted on common sense.  Sure he could have waited and gotten drawn into a suit.  He decided not to and that is a sign he wants to focus on his product and users, not worry about a moral victory over a name.",1254842352

Everybody should try it. Ideally, you should try it with the next project you start from scratch (or subproject as the case may be) because trying to retrofit an existing code base does not give accurate impressions. I'd also point out that some things are easier to test than others, but that once you have a bit of experience sometimes even the hard ones turn out to be feasible. (For example, you shouldn't go straight to UI testing, but there are many other good testing starting points, like parsing or network communication.) You really should stick with it at least long enough for it to detect at least one bug that is a total surprise to you, because that will happen, it's only a matter of time. But once you've tried it, I respect your opinion after that.<p>I've also tried TDD, which I just could not get into, whereas unit tests I love.",1254842156

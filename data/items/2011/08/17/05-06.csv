A fascinating topic and fascinating characters involved in the creation of money (like the Rothschilds and their involvement in toppling governments and funding conflict).<p>Every financial instrument we use today - from bonds, stocks, notes, interest, credit, debit, trade finance instruments etc. have an interesting story around their origin.<p>Fibonacci bought over the Arabic number system, base 10 notation (which makes interest easier to calculate), and set formulas for conversion, standard units of weight etc. It was a bit like an early draft standard for merchant traders.<p>With the history, you soon realize that money is just a promissory note or a debt, and that all money is borrowed. With a wallet full of notes what you have is a promise from the US Government that the notes can be readily exchanged.<p>The more recent fascination with gold-backed currency seems a bit ridiculous if you understand the history and why we went into gold and then back out of it.",1313560704

(The first time through school, I was interested in different things and ended up with a philosophy degree.) While some of people I encountered in the CS department were there to line up a job, school <i>can</i> just be an efficient, focused learning method for the curious.<p>In general, one nice thing about hiring CS students as opposed to purely self-taught programmers is that, in my experience, they're more likely to have a good understanding algorithms and data structures. Self-taught coders often only learn as much as they think they need to know about the topic to complete the task in front of them. (Obviously, for those interested, it's as straightforward to teach yourself analysis of algorithms as any other topic.) For some types of programming positions, having a rigorous background in this area is crucial, though in others not so much.",1313560558

They are all measurements of some kind of flux, so you have a certain quantity of signal, which then has to be divided by the surface area of the sphere surrounding the source.  As the distance from the source increases, the surface area of the sphere increases as the square of the radius.<p>So yes, if the source is in fact a point source radiating equally in all directions, the signal drops off as per the inverse square law.  But, if you have a very tight beam, then the signal strength is maintained for a lot longer.  In that case, signal loss is caused by diffusion, and by attenuation due to hitting matter that is in the beam. A highly parallel laser beam of a not unreasonable power level, preferably generated from a satellite orbiting outside any atmosphere, should be capable of being received pretty much anywhere in the galaxy.  Alternatively, if you have a big enough dish, you could do the same thing with radio waves.  Indeed, it is estimated that Arecibo is capable of communicating with any other Arecibo-style dish in a roughly 100 hundred light year diameter around the Earth, if the two happen to be pointed at each other, and one is transmitting whilst the other is receiving... <a href=""http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/limitations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/limitations.html</a><p>And that's with a measly 1000kW radio, weaker than most primary radars used today.",1313559026

So all the middle finger does is touch the pad and raise again.<p>I use my right index finger for pointing. To move the cursor up & down I do the same as for scrolling, only with my index finger. For left & right I do what would look like pushing a marble to move the cursor left and the reverse to move it to the right. So my index finger really points (mostly) to the left side (depending on forearm position) and expands in it's natural path.<p>Regarding heavy keyboard use you often hear about the emacs pinky when somebody over years strenuously used their pinky to hold the control key down.\nWell, I've noticed that I press control with the finger nail of my pinky and alt with the nail of my thumb.

If you have a bad job, at least 8 hours of your day are spent not liking your current situation. (But at least you have a job, can feed the family, etc.) If you're unemployed, your day-to-day life may be less stressful without those 8 hours of teeth-grinding and you get to hang out with your cat a lot more. (But you can't get a job, your kids are going hungry, whatever.) Going from depressed unemployment to a crappy job is worse though, I think because it makes you miserable day-to-day and reflectively too for a while, since you still haven't gotten over your unemployment depression.<p>Happiness is strongly correlated with income up until $60k or so, then it levels off.

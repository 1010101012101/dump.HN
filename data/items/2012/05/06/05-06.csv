It does matter, whether or not you buy into ""everyone uses search to find things"", if only to reduce the likelyhood of phishing attacks.<p>In short, don't confuse people. Don't launch a product with a name that is someone else's domain (unless it's a scummy/obvious squatter).  Do own the domain that corresponds to your product.

Why not use something unlikely to change such as either elevation or country?<p>Likewise, tournament city is not a fixed value for a tournament.  For example, the Australian Open, which he uses as one of his examples, has also been set in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Christchurch (NZ), and Hastings (NZ).<p>To resolve this, he would either have to introduce a two column primary key (tournament, year), or pick some simpler data.

And let's be honest, lots of military traditions are kind of arbitrary (like the part where if you're walking with someone, the senior ranking person is on the right hand side--what, do you get shot at more often from the left hand side?) Having to adapt to a bunch of arbitrary traditions might have some benefit in discipline or something, but each individual tradition isn't necessarily there for a practical reason.

3934263,comment,3931958,3933410,1,0,theretodivert,,,"Lee stopped editing in 1972. Wolfman left in 1980. So, what happened during that time?<p>Various writer-editors were given the title of editor-in-chief but they really didn't do that job. Roy Thomas, Len Wein, Wolfman, Gerry Conway (for less than 2 months), and then Archie Goodwin all had a significant amount of reprinted comics published because the new issues weren't done in time. Readers hate reprinted stories. (The only writer-editor who did not become editor-in-chief was Steve Gerber.)<p>What stopped this trend? Marvel hired an editor to be an editor-in-chief. This annoyed a few of the writer-editors and so most left in dramatic diva fashion.<p>Most comic fans do consider the 60's Marvel as equally good as the 80's Marvel, which includes Walter Simonson's Thor, Frank Miller's Daredevil, Byrne's Fantastic Four, Roger Stern and John Romita Jr's Amazing Spider-Man, and Claremont, et al's X-Men.<p>70's DC is an example of how to ruin a company. Without detailing their editorial problems, let's focus on two significant events. Sometime during 1972 and 1974, Marvel starts to outside DC for the first time in history. Except for a handful of months, this has been true until very recently. The second event is known as the DC implosion. DC screwed up and had to cancel a large number of their titles. Much of their talent landed jobs at Marvel.<p>So Wolfman and the other writer-editors jumping ship for DC was not a step up. It was a step away from meeting deadlines, and other responsibilities. Lee understood that no editor-in-chief could edit the writer-editors, which is likely why he left when he did.",1336282887

The Chinese are more willing to flock to a domestic copycat of a service innovated by the west, even the copycat was inferior. They will complain about how the domestic version is buggy, lousy, unethical and evil, but still choose it over a western alternative. I have wondered why for quite a few years, and still cannot come up with a logical answer. Yet one example had once offered me part of the explanation. Giant Interactive is a leading online MMO company in China, when they stared their games weren't as good as Korean or US ones; but they sent thousands of employees out and installed their game in countless internet cafes in the second tiers cities across the country, along with their other Chinese dirty tricks, Giant managed to captivate millions of players and secured their revenue stream.

The Southern Baptist can argue from authority about biblical interpretations given that they should know Greek/Hebrew/Latin, ancient mediterranean history, etc. They can't argue from authority about evolutionary biology if they don't know anything about it.<p>The reason I posted here is because I don't talk to my ML/AI friends often, I don't have many of them, and they haven't explained why they think what they do.<p>I don't understand why it is taking so much effort to get a simple amount of proof. Surely, there's a corpus of data with performance metrics that exists and can conclusively demonstrate one way or another?",1336280963

I suspect that's only one aspect.",1336280949

3934225,comment,3934072,3934072,2,0,moocow01,,,"I'm not going to comment too much on the ethical dilemmas of this behavior but I think it is a symptom of the changing dynamic of the productization of the web.<p>The consumer products on the web (in the larger sense.. apps etc) seem to be moving more towards bite-size, disposable bits that attract attention by being somehow notable or sensational.  Additionally, it seems like the half life of successful products are shortening over time as well.  In other words, app development is moving more towards the movie and music industry model and less towards the types of business models seen in most hard science-based industries.  A lot of this is enabled at least somewhat by tools that make it quicker and easier to build 'stuff' although I'd still say web application development is somewhat of a mess (but getting better).<p>I see the long term trajectory being that eventually putting certain types of apps together will be very accessible to semi-technical people and will become relatively low effort.  In essence, think Excel for apps that covers 90% of typical use cases (CRUD, etc.)  (Note: this is not an argument that technical people will become obsolete - we will move onto the next challenge)  As this comes more and more to fruition I think many will see applications as being ephemeral and relatively disposable, and consequently (as much as it pains me to say it), the acceptance and occurrence of copying features and design will continue to go up.<p>Lastly, while the complaints about copying are valid and I personally find it pretty despicable, investors and entrepreneurs should know that this is a risk in competing in this space.  Its getting easier to copy. There will continue to be more and more jackasses that take advantage of it due to better tools.  If you want to mitigate the risk, focus on tough technical challenges.",1336280878

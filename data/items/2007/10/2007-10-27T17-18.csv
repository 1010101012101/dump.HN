The protocol itself is written as a series of design patterns so each command had a predictable request pattern and a response pattern. After you get past the initial parsing of the command and response strings the protocol become much easier IF you think of them as a series of patterns.",1193507790

73213,comment,73112,73151,0,0,rontr,,,"I agree that many desktop apps can't be entirely replaced by web-based equivalents. However, if a webapp can provide 80% of the features of a similar desktop app but with a much lower barrier to entry (nothing to install, cross-platform) and additional web-oriented features (collaboration, publishing, Facebook intergration, etc), this webapp can potentially capture a large market share. Google Docs is a good example -- it will never do everything that MS Office can do but it's easy to use and it's certainly good enough for many users. Desktop apps still occupy a niche, but the Web has made this niche much smaller than it used to be.",1193506750
73212,comment,73122,73122,0,0,ericb,,,"What they have is impressive at least as an implementation of AI window dressing. It did a  decent job with context assuming this was not overtly scripted as they claim. <p>Most notably, though, if sylvia was an astounding breakthrough in the sense they claim (strong AI) they would have a sylvia chat-window on the website. The absence of a chat window means they realize if you were to poke at it you would be let-down. If anyone finds a sylvia instance to chat with, please post it.<p><a href=""http://cognitivecode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cognitivecode.com/</a>

73209,comment,73112,73112,0,0,andrewfong,,,"You know, eventually the line between the desktop and the web is simply going to disappear. Web apps will cache more data on the user's hard-drive and run more code on the user's CPU. Meanwhile, desktop apps will store/backup more data online and offload more computation to servers (or maybe other desktops).  There's huge potential for libraries or tools that make developing half-desktop / half-web apps easier.<p>Question is what form will those tools take. I wouldn't be too surprised if the OS just became a ginormous browser that could talk directly to hardware like the graphics card and a huge cache for storing ""installed"" web apps.",1193506266

-hardware and drivers are a tough science, have you done them, have you certified them?  last.fm has a small app that scrobbles, which is a far cry from a desktop app.<p>what are you describing as a desktop app?<p>-you can always create a plugin.<p>2) no graphics card.
-there are a number of 3d accelerated plugins out there

-i think flash connects to your digital camera<p>4) no phone.
- flash and voip are being used together<p>5) no clipboard for anything but text.
- link to a web copy of it<p>6) if I want to email my image from fauxto or flickr to someone via gmail I have to download them it upload it. (Nobody ever mentions this elephant in the web 2.0 living room. How do you get data from one web app to another? An un-started startup perhaps?)
- we are using a combination of flash, javascript, and web proxies<p>7) Half ass interfaces. I really give props to the fauxto guys for pushing the limits but only half ass users like me will ever see it as a worthy replacement for photoshop.
-its hard but the pay off is huge because of the reasons you listed above for a web app.<p>8) No OS integration. I like how Address Book, iPhoto and iCal can talk to Mail.app. 
that can all work together between web apps.",1193505128

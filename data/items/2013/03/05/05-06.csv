(By the way, a MUCH more ""feature-rich,"" useful, and snappy app than facebook!) Facebook isn't doing anything comparable to what TSF Shell does, not for me anyway. I bet this is why my phone recently started taking 30 seconds to make a phonecall (!).<p>I can't believe an app requires 8M RAM just for method names! That's 3% of my entire usable memory (what's left after Motorola Blur takes its share) -- just for the method names for a single app. Surely I must be misunderstanding what goes into that buffer. It's unimaginable to me that they really need such a vast amount of space. It's unimaginable that they really expect their app to work at all on an old phone without choking it to death.<p>If I grasp this correctly, printing just the method names would create a book double the size of the King James Version of the Bible. Maybe you are going to argue having so many methods is good programming practice, not bloat. But don't argue that you ""support"" a system when just the method names total around 3% of usable memory for that system. And there are a lot of devices with considerably less memory than what I've got.<p>Why don't you release a stripped down, ""lite"" version of the app that works on an Android 2 phone even if it has more than 5 applications installed? Some phones don't even allow uninstalling facebook. They are simply stuck with the bloat (I mean, good programming practices :-).",1362462906

But I don't know anything about Fuji film either.<p>On scanning resolution, thanks for the detail.  So, the resolution I am getting now at Sam's Club, 1818 * 1228 = 2,232,504 maybe isn't too awful.<p>Apparently getting color negative film scanned to something like the old Kodak PhotoCD is still possible at, say,<p><a href=""http://www.twocatdigital.com/scanning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twocatdigital.com/scanning.html</a><p>Their Web site mentions files sizes and file types, but I didn't find much on their resolution in pixels.<p>So, net, right, it looks like a current, high-end, Nikon or Canon full frame 35 mm digital single lens reflex camera or even a movie camera with the Canon CCD sensor of the OP will be much better than color negative film in my old Nikormat on sensitivity, i.e., ASA 'film speed' and resolution.<p>So, if I want to dig into photography again, then I should get a sack full of modern equipment and copies of the relevant Adobe software.  In the meanwhile, shooting color negative film and getting it scanned at Sam's Club (if they still do that), Wal-Mart, TwoCat, etc. seems like still a relatively good way to take pictures.",1362462419

You're limiting yourself to the period following its expansion and then claiming it hasn't expanded very much since then.<p>>The federal budget has grown, but most of it has been in the form of transfer payments--money that goes straight from one private citizen to the other.<p>Privatizing the inefficiency doesn't make it go away. Taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to Solyndra was not a good thing. And increasing the amount of money on the table for redistribution very much exacerbates the problem of distributive issues crowding out other important federal concerns for voter attention.<p>>What makes you think that having 50 different poorly run versions of any given social program is a better idea than having 1 somewhat less poorly run version of any given program?<p>Local programs have greater accountability and can be better tailored to the different needs of local populations. If a specific program isn't meeting the particular needs of a given state, that state's legislature is more likely to have the right incentives to fix it than Washington. If a state's legislature is wasting money on boondoggles, the cost of such things is born by a more concentrated set of taxpayers who are consequently more likely to demand accountability and shut down wasteful programs. And reducing federal spending would reduce the amount of unjustified subsidies that flow from high population states to low population states solely as a result of the low population states having the same number of federal senators.<p>Also, this:<p>""It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."" -Louis Brandeis",1362461786

I think adderall is primarily introduced to people as medicine by some authority figure the person respects (doctor), and they're likely to stick to their prescribed doses. Vs, I think meth is more frequently introduced as a fun energy drug (or advertised as MDMA), with vague dosages, unknown quality and purity, etc. Maybe meth users titrate until they feel good, which means escalating dosages quickly due to tolerance. (I can't speak from personal experience here.)<p>I think some minority of both adderall and meth users (ab)use the stimulants to try and overcome drowsiness and focus more on their work, like some college students (including article author). I think a fair number of people do this without any bad outcomes (myself included). But a fair number also escalate in response to tolerance, and this kind of use is problematic. Maybe awareness of tolerance, neurobiology, etc, would help? I read a lot of erowid before I ever consumed any drugs, but I also have pretty strong self-control, so I don't know that it would work for everyone.<p>Anecdotally, I don't even try to use amphetamines for productivity anymore because they don't clear from my system fast enough to avoid interfering with my sleep. I'm more productive for one day (if that), but less productive over a two-day period.",1362461638

Actually, I don't have a ""thing"" about Ruby or Rails developers, but some aspects of their mindset are very dangerous. The first time I heard that YAML could initialize objects from the serialization structure, I was absolutely shocked. How could that NOT be a disaster?<p>Take care. You're responsible for your code and its security. You're not playing a game. Your business is not a hackathon. Don't claim to offer ""services"" unless you are plan to be a servant of others. Servants don't code recklessly. You are the custodian of your clients' digital life and wellbeing. Choose projects run by grownups -- like izs and ry (the people who have run nodejs). Again, getting hacked is NOT okay.<p>By the way, if you want to learn how to run a project, subscribe to the nodejs-dev thread. That's a first-rate education in how to manage a large project with a lot of hype and growing pains. Watch and take notes.",1362460245

I am overweight now and have been normal weight before when I've exercised regularly and it made a big difference both cognitively and with energy, etc. I need to do that again. I learned the hard way not to diet though. It worked but it is true what they say; you gain it back +10 lbs (or more).<p>* Replace soda with coffee or tea, even if you hate them. I really hated them. I feel much better not drinking diet sodas constantly. Try to eliminate caffeine if you can.<p>* Try eliminating/limiting aluminum (drinking from cans, using hair products with aluminum, etc.). (May be unnecessary, but lower your Alzheimer's risk.)<p>* Try taking daily vitamins (Centrum, etc.), Fish/cod oil pills. Consider taking a baby aspirin each day if you are 40+. Don't overdose on daily recommended intake, even when sick! Some things can be really bad. Don't overdose on ginko, etc. either!<p>* There is nothing wrong with wanting to be your best, but you'll be your best when you aren't cheating and hurting yourself, and that is as good as you need to be.

I feel on a regular basis like I don't deserve to have what I have and that I'm a failure. In many ways, I am a failure; but mostly because I'm doing it to myself. I eat too much. I don't exercise. I hate my job. I think I should die. I feel like I need the food so my brain won't get distracted by being hungry. I feel like I don't have time to exercise. I feel like it is my fault that I hate my job. But, all that is crap. I need to take care of myself, and so do you! Just go on a short walk tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. Eat 1/2 as much as normal if you eat too much. Drink less caffeine. Talk to your doc about changing your meds or anything at all that you're worried about. Get a hobby and get outside more.

At the time I was running at least two miles every day so it's not like I wasn't exercising. But then one day I changed from running a couple miles to running 50-yard sprints, as fast and as hard as I could push myself. The first day I only ran four sprints, but I felt euphoric the rest of the day -- the best I had felt in years. So I tried it again a couple days later, and sure enough it worked again -- I felt amazing.<p>So then I had to find out why this worked -- why a few sprints were so much more effective than running several miles. I started Googling and eventually found Ratey's book -- it explains the entire biochemical process of what's going on and why sprinting works.<p>It's an eye-opening read. Each chapter covers how high-intensity cardio affects things like stress, anxiety, depression, ADHD. I have ADHD but haven't taken anything for it in years (since I was in college), and I can attest that sprints not only fixed by stress levels, but my ADHD symptoms were almost non existent.<p>Here's a key point that Ratey makes throughout the book that completely changed my perspective on things -- he says that instead of thinking of exercise as something you should do to look good and build a healthy body, you should instead think of exercise as the key to building a healthy brain:<p>""We all know that exercise makes us feel better, but most of us have no idea why. We assume its because were burning off stress or reducing muscle tension or boosting endorphins, and we leave it at that. But the real reason we feel so good when we get our blood pumping is that it makes the brain function at its best"" (<a href=""http://www.sparkinglife.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkinglife.org</a>).<p>In the book's introduction he goes on to say, ""Building muscles and conditioning the heart and lungs are essentially side effects. I often tell my patients that the point of exercise is to build and condition the brain.""<p>In fact the brain exercise routine he recommends is similar to a weight workout routine, in that you have to push yourself hard one day, and then take a day off to let your brain recover, just like in weight training. Another key is when you sprint, always put everything you have into it. Run as fast and as hard as you can so you are constantly pushing your body and your brain past their limitations -- this is the key to growth.",1362459672

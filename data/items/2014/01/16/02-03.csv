When you put people into jobs, the – let&#x27;s say architecture – of the organization they are put into has a drastic influence on their behavior (see the Stanford prison experiment)<p>The question that should be asked is what&#x27;s wrong with the architecture of these organizations that brings out the natural bad qualities of human behavior in average people?",1389841076

I don&#x27;t think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they&#x27;re made to lead. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.</i><p>and &quot;Lies We Tell Kids&quot;: <a href""http://paulgraham.com/lies.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://paulgraham.com/lies.html</a> :<p><i>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn till age 18. To mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse. That&#x27;s an extreme example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes national news. But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.<p>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in. And it seems great for 10 year olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn&#x27;t notice how sterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends&#x27; houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in. On a log scale I was midway between crib and globe. A suburban street was just the right size. But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake.<p>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it&#x27;s often frustrating at 15. This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed for 10 year olds.<p>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them in suburbia? A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3 year old daughter &quot;saw too much.&quot; Off the top of my head, that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger.</i>",1389841065

7067766,comment,7065668,7065836,27,0,reginaldo,,,"The last stripe CTF literally changed my life. I&#x27;ve always been interested in security but didn&#x27;t have the confidence and honestly thought I didn&#x27;t have it takes to be successful in the field. I decided to try the CTF anyway just for fun and was able to finish everything much to my surprise. I had read about SHA-1 padding when it affected Flickr so I knew just what to do on the level that involved SHA-1 padding, which I thought was the hardest.<p>When I came to HN and saw a lot of people I admire talking about how hard it was, especially daeken [1], I remember thinking something along the lines of &quot;well, I thought it was hard but not <i>that</i> hard&quot;, and decided to try to find a few security bugs in open source software... Best thing I ever did... In just a few weeks I found some nice bugs on both Drupal and Wordpress, got the first CVE credited to myself, and then I started to have fun (and some profit) with the various bug bounty programs around the web, most notably those run by Google (I&#x27;m currently 0x05 overall) [2] and Facebook (7th) [3].<p>After a year doing security work on the side I was able to quit my day job last august and now I make my living basically as a security consultant and also as a &quot;bounty hunter&quot;. I also got multiple job offers from US companies (I currently live in Brazil).<p>And all of this happened only because the stripe CTF gave me the confidence to actually follow my dreams. Oh, and I still don&#x27;t know if I have what it takes to be really successful in the field, but frankly security bugs are everywhere so I go ahead and keep on finding them. I&#x27;m learning a lot every single day and the mean time between bugs is getting lower and lower, which is great. So thank you Stripe.

7067759,comment,7062923,7066968,1,0,rayiner,,,"While the regimes aren&#x27;t inviolate, Congressional action would probably be required to change the status quo. Besides that, the fact that you can reimagine the legal rules doesn&#x27;t change the philosophical and political positions that led to the existing status quo. It&#x27;s a mistake to think that the drafters of the 1996 telecom act didn&#x27;t understand what they were doing. They made a conscious effort to try and deregulate the industry while conceding to keep much of the existing regime applicable to voice service.<p>All this could be changed if you let Congress have another shot at the classifications, but you really don&#x27;t want that. The forces that made telephone regulation the morass that it is will conspire to turn internet regulation into a morass as well. It sounds good to say that rural areas should have access to internet service, but opening that can of worms is a disaster in the making.<p>Infrastructure regulation in the U.S. is a disaster because of the disproportionate power of rural voters. It&#x27;s not efficient to build infrastructure to rural and exurban areas, but rural votes, particularly in the Senate, hold infrastructure projects hostage unless inefficient infrastructure is built in those areas. That&#x27;s why Amtrak is obligated to run a nationwide network when it should just run a train line from DC to Boston. Indeed, the desire to provide universal service is responsible for much of the dysfunctional aspects of the telecom industry to begin with. Many cable providers are monopolies because municipalities granted monopoly status as a concession for building service broadly instead of just to the profitable locations.<p>Look at the aspects of the telecom industry that are actually getting people excited. T-Mobile&#x27;s new LTE network, for example. The reason it works is because T-Mobile avoids a whole bunch of capital construction by only focusing on urban areas. Cities get LTE, and everyone else gets HSPA or 2G. Or look at Google&#x27;s fiber service: hitting major urban areas and avoiding anywhere that doesn&#x27;t yield a lot of subscribers per mile of fiber. That&#x27;s the right way forward--that&#x27;s how we get internet speeds in the U.S. that match countries in Asia and Europe that are much more heavily urbanized. Treating internet service the way we treat other public infrastructure will destroy that.",1389840700

There were a fair number of temporarily successful co-processors in that general era of many different sorts; aside from float (and smaller markets for FFT chips and boards and some efforts at vector co-processors), the most famous were probably the multimedia coprocessors on the Atari ST and on the Amiga (Jay Miner etc).<p>If that&#x27;s too late for your tastes, look at the nearly universal support chips for 8080/z80 like DMA. Possibly one could count UART and PIO too.<p>But Moore&#x27;s Law kept killing them, and eventually it became common wisdom that such was the case, so they faded.<p>Over a long time period, external devices to offload the primary cpu come and go, under different guises, as Ivan Sutherland noticed already in 1968.<p>Intel&#x27;s 8089 and related may have been partially motivated by the success of IO processors in the mainframe and supercomputer world in the 1960s and later.<p>P.S.

Obviously 100% of the sale buyers would have paid full price.  I know that the majority of games in my Steam collection are not games I would pay full price for, but they are game that I was happy to pick up in a Humble Indie Bundle.  Half the games in those bundles I don&#x27;t even plan on playing ever and just bought because they were bundled with a few games I thought might be interesting.<p>Choosing to participate in a sale increases revenue over not participating, but the author is worried about a world where sales become the new norm.  Of course, if that&#x27;s the case, bump your price from $16 to $30 and feel free to participate in those 50% sales after you&#x27;ve done your initial price bump.  The market will sort that out.<p>Additionally, sales are great for increasing brand awareness.  Many retail sales aren&#x27;t designed to make money on their own as much as get people into the store where they might buy full-price merchandise.  As an anecdote, I bought Terraria for something like $2.50 on a steam sale.  When I first heard of it I thought it didn&#x27;t sound that great.

7067648,comment,7066002,7067552,2,0,mitchellh,,,"Since building Docker support into Packer, I&#x27;ve heard a few beneficial points from some companies I&#x27;ve helped integrate it into as well as some users. I&#x27;m not here to convince you, but just to share what I feel are some valid use cases. Alas, portability is not the only reason, but is one.<p>* Software installation/configuration knowledge remains solely in existing Chef/Puppet/etc. code-bases. Dockerfiles can add another format for software to be &quot;installed&quot; (or &quot;packaged&quot; if you prefer). Packer + Docker allows you to use your existing expertise, CI process, etc in order to create these containers.<p>* Common &quot;image&quot; configuration format: again Dockerfiles represent a Docker-specific way of building images. This is all well and good, but it is still very common to have multiple types of images (AMIs, Docker containers, VirtualBox, etc.). In a world where Docker isn&#x27;t used everywhere, it is a burden to maintain multiple methods of building images. Packer provides a single way to do it that is flexible to multiple platforms. And even if an org decides to transition completely to Docker, Packer helps get them there. Perhaps they want to switch to Dockerfiles after that, but there is still point #1 above.<p>* Portability: Packer represents a low-risk way to adopt Docker containers, if you use Docker. Dockerfiles are somewhat of an &quot;all-in&quot; approach to Docker. If you don&#x27;t like Docker, or Docker isn&#x27;t good for this specific use case (yet, or ever, doesn&#x27;t matter), then Dockerfiles have to be translated over to another format. As I&#x27;m sure you know, big IT is all about minimizing risk when adopting new technologies (actually, a top point to NOT adopt new technologies that we have to fight!). Packer represents a way to say &quot;yes, Docker is new, but Packer provides a pretty low-risk way to get into it. Let&#x27;s first build vSphere images, like you&#x27;re used to, and see how those transition to Docker containers. If you don&#x27;t like it, we still built automation to build vSphere VMs!&quot;<p>* Extensibility: Packer is very plugin-friendly. You can hook into almost anything. This allows some nice plugins to exist to help augment the process for building images, whether they be containers or not. If Dockerfiles don&#x27;t support a command to do something, then Packer plugins can very easily do that for you. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t make sense for this certain feature to be a core feature of Dockerfiles, OR Packer. Either way, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because the org can just build a plugin for themselves and use it internally. No harm done.<p>* Process friendliness: In addition to the portability above, centralizing on Packer for image creation is 1..N less processes to adhere to. Docker has a different process for building containers. Aminator has a different process. Every new process is a new special snowflake CI handler to run them, new education for employees, new maintenance. By using Packer, you can use the same CI runners/parsers/steps (Bamboo, Jenkins, etc.) to build any sort of image.<p>And to answer your question on &quot;what does a Packer config file look like&quot; here is a basic, but fairly typical config file:<p><pre><code>    {\n      &quot;builders&quot;: {{\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,\n        &quot;image&quot;: &quot;ubuntu&quot;,\n        &quot;export_path&quot;: &quot;image.tar&quot;\n      }],\n\n      &quot;provisioners&quot;: [{\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\n        &quot;scripts&quot;: [&quot;base.sh&quot;, &quot;nginx.sh&quot;]\n      }]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nPretty simple. Easily human and machine editable/readable. Also, if you happened to want to build an AMI too, it is not much different. And finally, if you use Chef/Puppet/etc, you can just drop that in there, and it works just like you&#x27;d expect. Packer even installs Puppet/Chef for you (if you want)!<p>I hope that clears things up. Packer has been helping with adoption of Docker for many people I&#x27;ve helped! I think its clear from my work on Vagrant and Packer (and some future stuff), that the one thing I try to avoid is lock-in of any sort. I focus instead of human process, rather than technical specifics. You can argue that Packer itself is a lock-in format, but the point is that its a single similar format for many. Its agenda is to be as helpful to as many projects as possible that need images, and not to discriminate in any way.<p>And to address the grandparent (I&#x27;ll comment directly on that to): with regards to speed, we&#x27;re working on what we&#x27;re calling &quot;snapshotting&quot; functionality in Packer now. With this, Packer will snapshot containers at various points in the build process, just like `docker build`. So when you run a `packer build`, it&#x27;ll start only from the point it needs to, rather than from scratch. A cool thing is that this feature will extend to all the other builders, too, so if you&#x27;re building a VirtualBox VM from an ISO, for example, it won&#x27;t reinstall the OS if it doesn&#x27;t have to. Cool stuff.",1389838952

Steam-style repeated sales have the bonus marketing benefit of being noteworthy and counter-intuitively do not appear to cannibalize high-revenue sales much if at all.<p>With a slow-burn, &quot;it&#x27;s not done yet&quot; release, going out at a low price matches the general low expectations for the product and has the bonus marketing benefit of getting talkative early-adopters on board early and also getting them increasingly excited as development proceeds.  As quality increases, price increases accordingly.  This has the bonus feature of putting some time pressure on customers who are on the fence about the cost/value proposition, but want to lock in a lower price by buying early.",1389837845

I&#x27;ve installed it on a few relative&#x27;s computers and they have all loved it and were able to pick it up completely on their own. Literally in one instance I installed ubuntu on my dad&#x27;s laptop, and left the day after. He didn&#x27;t even call me once for help on how to open something or do something (except for installing Skype, which he would have done anyway if it was a windows machine). It was all there. And these are people that don&#x27;t know how to attach something to an email. IMO the biggest problem is getting the damn OS on the computer, everything after that is cake.<p>Plus, pretty much every linux distro has a sort of &quot;start&quot; menu, and a taskbar.

Timing: The most successful companies are also the ones that are usually at a particular point in time when an opportunity exists.  Too early, you fail, too late, you fail as well (for different reasons).\n2. A scalable idea: The most successful companies find product or service ideas that scale hugely.  These ideas are  pretty rare.  More often, people find ideas they like and can execute but turn out to be ideas that scale only so far.  Sometime it turns out that they&#x27;ve actually founded a services business and didn&#x27;t know it.  More often, they find an idea that can scale to, say, $5m in revenue but then has trouble scaling beyond that.  Billion dollar ideas likely represent a very small portion.",1389837648

The city put up cameras and started collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in fines. Problem: city ordinance stated something like any ticket resulting from a photo must come from a camera mounted at a 90 degree angle to the street. Notice the bit about it being a 5-way intersection? None of the roads came together at a 90 degree angle. Point was, the city continued to violate their own ordinance for years because that single intersection was a cash cow - the whole system was automated so the pictures were taken, cars identified, tickets mailed. THAT is why there is so much outrage about cameras in the US - it&#x27;s the Man kicking us around.",1389837625

108081,comment,107683,108019,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Here's a fuller response.  You said:<p><pre><code>     infix only works with a limited number of built in 
     things, it doesn't scale nicely. i suppose you could
     change this, e.g. make # a special character, and then
     you can define infix foo then write arg1#foo#arg2. but
     like, that's ridiculous. no one wants to do that with 
     functions in general.
</code></pre>
First, there are languages which have infix functions as a first class concept in the language (e.g., J, and I would suppose APL and K), so it isn't that infix doesn't scale.  Secondly, even in languages which have the call() convention, user-definable operators can coexist (see logix, for example, which is an infix macro system built on top of python).<p>Additionally, you don't have to have an arg1#foo#arg2, as long as you're willing to use spaces to separate things, the way that lisps, forths, and so on do.",1201907545

It might be more fair to ask ""What's wrong with Scheme?"", as Arc seems much closer to Scheme than CL.<p>As I see it, one of the biggest reasons to create Arc is social. It doesn't have to do anything CL and Scheme don't already if PG and RTM can build a real community around it.",1201907492

What we have learned so far is:<p>1. Japanese have an extreme affection for foreign products<p>2. There is considerably less competition for online services than in the USA<p>3. SEO is comparably easy<p>1. # The iPhone was predicted to fail miserably in Japan. Well as it turns out Japanese are buying them like crazy.
# Japan is one of the biggest markets for Twitter.
# When I talk to other people about Facebook, they have never tried it, but most have heard of it. It is perceived as ""this cool new thing from the USA"".
# When I listen to conversations between Japanese I often hear ""It is from America"" to impress the other person.
# More than 90% of all Japanese women poses a Louis Vuitton product <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/164421461.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/164421461....</a><p>2. As the Author pointed out, the desktop market is considerably smaller than the Ketai market. I believe this explains why Japanese websites are from comparably lower quality. Not just from a technology standpoint, but also from the content perspective. There are just not as much people fighting for customers, hence the standards are about 4-7 years behind what one sees in the US web-market.<p>3. Until now, we did not dedicate any serious efforts to SEO. So far, for every visitor Google sends us from the USA, we get 10 from Japan.
My explanation for this is again, low competition.<p>The hardest part is actually getting someone to write in Japanese. The language is really difficult and most Japanese don't think their commandment of the language is good enough to be published. (I guess this might serve as one of the explanations why there is not as much competition in the Japanese online market)",1299070683

It may be more useful to view DNA as a just storage medium.<p>There's an encoding scheme on top of the nucleotides -- amino acids are encoded with trinucleotides. The RNA sequence AUG can be used as a start signal to indicate that peptide synthesis should begin at <i>that</i> point (it can also be used to encode the residue Methionine). Other sequences encode splice sites, these are used to signal the removal of sequences called introns.<p>Still other sequences (DNA binding sites, like the famous TATA box) have a high affinity for protein (those with DNA binding domains). The presence or absence of enhancers or suppressors can activate or deactive protein synthesis.<p>DNA also contains error checking information. Eukaryotic DNA undergoes methylation (think of this as adding meta-data to the DNA). After cells undergo replication, the new DNA is untagged. When error-checking enzymes happen upon a mismatch in the DNA, they remove the untagged base. There are also unrecoverable errors. For example, two adjacent Thymine bases can undergo cross-linking upon ultraviolet exposure -- the bases get stuck together. This sort of error can contribute to melanoma.<p>I don't think that the data structure analogy is appropriate for DNA, but there are certainly data structures encoded on top of it.",1299069229

earnings and getting nearly nothing for it.<p>They avoid having to pay credit card processing fees, which on a cheap app probably eat most of the 30%. They don't have to write their own payment handling code. They don't have to write and host their own download servers. They don't need to worry about things like re-authenticating downloads for users upgrading to a new device. They get their apps listed on the Market and thus have their app be discoverable in the place where most Android users will look for apps. They get access to the other Market infrastructure like in-app purchases and the licensing server.<p>You think that's not providing any value?

9130096,comment,9129807,9129980,0,0,femto,,,"In that vein, perhaps there is a call for a protocol/RFC whereby each person&#x27;s public comments live on their own server, and a comments section, such as HN, would just return a bunch of links (or even just a root link, with child links being distributed with each comment)?  The client would be responsible for constructing the comments page by contacting each individual server.  Maybe hashes could be used with each link, so a client could flag any after the event rewriting?<p>It&#x27;s got a NNTP flavour to it, if clients start doing caching and the NNTP client&#x27;s view is threaded, but the idea would be that the canonical copy remains on the author&#x27;s server, where they retain control of and responsibility for what they write.  Its also RSS like, in that a server&#x27;s output could be viewed as a stream of comments?  It would be a bit like a blog, but each entry would be linked into a conversation/comment page by the client, possibly with selective downloading if comment are collapsible.  It&#x27;s basically SMTP, but instead of the server sending a message once, a client could contact the server at some point in the future and request a retransmission of a particular message.  Is there already an RFC or protocol that fills this niche?",1425264968

And I realized I was watching the video on my phone vs the laptop I had previously used. Unlike my laptop, my phone&#x27;s screen dims based on ambient light and lower levels were bringing out different hues in the image. My laptop also has auto color temperature adjustment based on the time of day which was affecting my perception.<p>Based on different screens I could see the exact same image side by side looking both black and blue and white and gold and realized there may be exogenous variables not included in the explanations that had previously upset me.<p>In my original comment to the article, I was reacting to the fact that people were trying to explain how why people were incorrectly interpreting the black and blue dress as white and gold because their mind is playing tricks on them based on optical illusions which generally work the opposite way.<p>Like you, I saw white and gold, I have been tested as having perfect color vision, know that fashion designers commonly rip styles off and given the contextual lighting, the image looked like it could have been of a knock-off in tiajuana and I didn&#x27;t like that the only evidence that the dress is black and blue were the claims and evidence presented by a satirical musician submitting content on a blog representing another woman and a company with an identical dress who stands to profit quite a bit from this publicity this has generated and as honest Abe said, you can&#x27;t believe everything on the internet.<p>But after seeing the image side by side looking differently on different screens, I am at peace with dressgate and think everyone is right about the two sets of colors seen, though I still think other explanations like solarization, the dress actually being white and gold but photographed to capture a blue hue, or screen discrepency should not be dismissed because optical illusions are a real thing and disagree with one hypothesis being advertised to summarily explain such a contentious phenomena because there is proven evidence to make that one idea plausible.",1425264317

I will humor you:<p>>Guix, while it claims to support repeatable builds, keeps you in the same restrictive build process as other package managers.<p>This sentence makes no sense to me.  Do you know what &quot;reproducible builds&quot; means in this context?  See: <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About</a><p>>It&#x27;s hard to configure how your packages are built<p>In Guix, packages are Scheme objects, giving you maximum flexibility.  You can easily customize configure/make flags, along with many other things, to make custom package builds.  It&#x27;s also easy to maintain your own separate package recipes.  Guix makes packaging easy.  That said, there are folks that are interested in a global configuration system, so maybe we&#x27;ll see that some day.  Guix is alpha software, it doesn&#x27;t have every bell and whistle that you might like.<p>>and hard to maintain a server for private packages<p>First of all, you don&#x27;t need a server for any packages.  There is no single point of trust in Guix.  You can build every single package on your own computer.  Now, you could run your own Hydra instance like <a href=""https://hydra.gnu.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hydra.gnu.org</a>, and soon you&#x27;ll be able to run &#x27;guix publish&#x27; from any guix machine to spawn a server that exposes a Hydra-compatible web service for serving binaries.<p>>Add in its poor capabilities as a package manager<p>Transactional upgrades, rollbacks, and per-user package installation are poor capabilities?<p>>the bizarre requirement to upgrade the distribution to upgrade your package list<p>The package recipes ship with Guix, so upgrading Guix via &#x27;guix pull&#x27; gets you the new package recipes, too.  This does <i>not</i> upgrade the system, only the version of Guix for the user who ran &#x27;guix pull&#x27;.

13615,comment,13465,13465,0,0,febeling,,,"I think everything should be better than a RAZR. We use it as a worst-case target device at our company. But, more generally, the power of carriers is definitely a problem, and as I hear it's way worse in the US. Their biggest nightmare is voip in the mobile, obviously, so I guess they simply try to lock down any innovation in the usable mobile platform area. ",1176814511
13614,comment,13608,13613,0,0,jkush,,,"Actually - that's pretty hard to do. What would probably be more ""doable"" is to take a transcript (done manually by a transcriptionist) and sync up the text with the video. <p>You could provide links in a transcript which when clicked take you to the part of the video in question, if you'd like to see it. You could also go the other way, and use a transcript to provide subtitles.<p>Any ideas on how to make this happen? My intial thought is to exploit pauses and breaks in the sound and map them to sentences, etc. Voice mapping would help too, so you could map a sentence to Paul Graham and another sentence to the interviewer.<p>What would be pretty cool (actually, REALLY cool now that I think about it) would be desiging a transcript markup language that could be married to a video. Has anyone done this? Why not?<p>",1176814183

13612,comment,13610,13610,0,0,Tichy,,,"Wondering if you are taking part in any other online communities. Myself, I don't even know many places to visit. Sometimes I indulge in discussions on Slashdot-like pages (not a really community), another place is a closed community run by a friend, with mostly other friends from real life. How many other people have a place like that? Do many people just use the social pages (MySpace etc) for that? Somehow I doubt it, it doesn't feel the same.<p>It just would be great to find likeminded people for the one or other thing. For exmaple sometimes I enjoy discussing economics, but I couldn't find a good online community for that yet.",1176813070

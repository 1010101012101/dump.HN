1089247,comment,1088745,1089029,0,0,notauser,,,"My preferred argument is that high labor costs increases supply which <i>reduces</i> the total cost of labor.<p>For example, in a city I need one DBA which costs me $100k. In the country I need <i>two</i> DBAs at $60k each, because if one leaves I'm not confident I can get another of sufficient skill before the business falls apart.<p>This applies less to larger businesses, which have internal economies of scale and so don't need to rely on the outside market as much. It also doesn't apply to those reliant on lower skilled labor which has a higher supply by default.",1264885041

Around 2000, I remember reading all these articles in video game magazines talking about how microsoft will never be a major player in consoles.  ""Microsoft is not a video game company, its not in their dna"".  Fast forward a bit and look at the console landscape now.  5.5 million xbox 360s were sold in the 4th quarter of 2009.   The xbox can now be considered a runaway success, despite the numerous setbacks that have occured (red ring of death).<p>With search the landscape is a bit different, but we shouldn't be so shortsighted as to count microsoft out of the game or think that bing will never gain >50% marketshare.

It's everyone else that should understand that having an unhealthy sense of entitlement to whatever drugs they can get is a bad thing.<p>> And if it makes them feel better, then why give them real medicine with real side effects? Side effects which, in aggregate, would cost billions to deal with.<p>Because people have suffered needlessly and even <i>died</i> as a result of ignoring good advice from their doctors in lieu of this quack medicine. How much extra is being spent because they waited forever for whatever they had to go away with homeopathy but it didn't and maybe even got worse?

They like good products, good service, low prices, and a nice user/shopping experience.  The crucial point is that whatever the good things are about your business, people have to feel them in a single interaction, the very first time — not years down the road.

Part of the problem is all the services that San Francisco provides to people down on their luck.  It makes the city a good place to live if you have nowhere to live.  But some shop owners have lost their patience, and I don't blame them.  I think I'd lose my patience too, after having to hose human feces off of the sidewalk outside my store several mornings in a row.  In some parts of the city (like the Haight, anywhere near GG Park), it's gotten pretty bad.",1264882945

1089171,comment,1088750,1089163,0,0,Groxx,,,"Samba networks do that for me on Windows too, despite the ability to refresh the window.  More often, it'll crash Explorer rather than actually update the info if something is already clogging the tubes.  Plus, network shares almost never update that quickly, and expecting them to do so is rather ridiculous.  Round-trip time to a server clearly wasn't implied as part of the Finder update speed.<p>And again, I'll point out that the terminal is right there.  If it's <i>Finder</i> that's slow, the terminal will still work.  If the <i>terminal</i> doesn't keep up-to-date, then it's a problem with their implementation of Samba, not Finder, and a refresh button would do nothing (except maybe nail your network with unnecessary requests by most people mashing it when something doesn't work).",1264882355

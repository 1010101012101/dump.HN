Thats exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.\nThe initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.<p>Its now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We already have a team for the backend and are now looking for an iOS developer who will create an iOS SDK and example applications.<p>Were looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing iOS applications and that has a good knowledge of the iOS ecosystem and its frameworks (CoreData etc.). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with Objective-C and Cocoa. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the iOS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.<p>Interested?

It works great in countries where people don't have a lot of money.<p>To sign a contract you need some postal address. There are countries where a lot of people simply don't have a postal address.<p>With postpaid SIMs the company will need to wait one whole month until they send the first bill, and then maybe another month until they reach the conclusion that the customer will not pay. What if the customer makes calls worth $1000 in two months? how do you get back that money in countries where it's really hard to enforce the law?\nTo prevent this some companies ask for a deposit for like $500. Good luck with that in Africa!<p>Also now, you can get the same ""options"" like a postpaid card. You put credit on your prepaid card and then activate one or more of the ""options"". I have one option that gives me 1 cent per minute voice calls. The price of the option is $1 per month. Because the price of the options are substracted from the prepaid credit every month, it works like a postpaid contract: $x every month for a list of benefits.<p>Prepaid is the right way to bill customers. The reason for not being the first and only way to bill customers is that for prepaid the billing is done in real-time. You need to cut the call exactly the second the credit hits 0. Imagine what real-time billing means for large countries like India.",1344235866

We spend almost 3 times the entire rest of the world combined, about $60 billion to $22 billion a year.  Global achievement requires global contribution.  Leveled for GDP, the rest of the world would need to spend about $160 billion a year more than they are.<p><i>Editing in more details from posts I've made before:</i><p>The total 2010 US Space budget was $64.6B. The entire rest of the world combined spent only $22.5B. NASA's 2010 budget was $18.7B, 83% of the spending for the rest of the world. The entire ESA budget is a paltry $4.6B, while the EU has a higher GDP than the US.<p>Not all US space spending is through NASA. For example, the GPS system is not included in NASA's budget, it's spearheaded by the Air Force Space Command, and comes out of the Defense budget. And before anyone says that Defense space spending should not be included, keep in mind that will dramatically reduce the overall global space budget which does include defense spending. For example, the European Galileo satellite navigation system, which has cost some 20B, is included in the ESA budget, so it would have to be taken out in order to compare with NASA, our civilian space program.<p>If the rest of the world spent as much as the United States on space exploration by GDP, global space spending would be 4.1 times higher than it is today. $267B instead of $87.1B.",1344235720

People start at forty and fifty.<p>I have a different point to make.<p>There will always be someone smarter than you. Someone who started younger, learned faster, accomplished more. They're smarter than you are now, and they'll probably always be smarter than you.<p>Just get used to that as quickly as possible and move on with your life.<p>Now, in fact it is easy to be the world-champion of something if you qualify it enough. (I probably still hold the world record for building an efficient triangular planar semiconductor ring laser, for example. Nobody cares. Least of all me.) If you insist on occupying the top of some hill on this earth, you can always find a way to build that hill. The easiest way is to build it in your own mind. Don't laugh: People find genuine, lifetime happiness by doing that.<p>And it is true that genius is ill-defined, and that if you define it by a specific criterion, and then <i>win</i> that criterion, many people still won't accept that you're the biggest genius, because, hey, it's only chess. Or Jeopardy. Or music. Or literature. Or astrophysics.<p>And it is probably true that, even if you could become the biggest genius in history, no contest, you've won, you're the proverbial Einstein you'd find it to be a big letdown. You'd feel just as confused as ever. You'd just be confused about harder problems. And meanwhile you'd find yourself <i>surrounded by people who do not understand the most basic and obvious things</i>.<p>But, no, these weak forms of my argument will not make you strong enough. I want to make you very strong, so I want you to visualize the person who is better than you <i>in every way</i>, and also twelve years old. And then I want you to get used to the existence of this person. And get on with your life.<p>Because other people's genius is not a problem. (Indeed, it's often <i>really</i> handy: Geniuses and prodigies can be good people to know. They do strange and wonderful things. It is fun to be their fan. It can be <i>really</i> fun to be on their team. This is a big reason why I live near MIT.)<p>If someone else's genius <i>is</i> a problem, it is probably not <i>your</i> problem.<p>---<p>When I was eighteen I was a fairly good math student. I enjoyed high-school math competitions, like the AHSME. I did pretty well. One year, based on my statewide ranking on the AHSME, I got invited to join a team of the top math students from my state to compete against an all-state team from another state.<p>This was one of the most valuable experiences of my life and I heartily endorse it. Because here's what happened: I got my <i>ass</i> handed to me. My teammates were <i>freakishly smart</i>. It turns out that the distribution of math-contest talent is not at all normal, and that being in the top 1% of contest-takers doesn't mean that you're within hailing distance of the top 0.5%. Oh, no.<p>As I remember it, one of the people on the trip wasn't an official member of our team. He was too young to compete, but was tagging along for fun. I think he might have been twelve. He was a better contest-problem mathematician at twelve than I've ever been in my life, that's for sure.<p>So what happened? As I remember, I had fun at the competition. I spent the time doing what amounted to janitorial work for the power-solvers at the head of our team: Filling in obvious missing steps, sharpening pencils, whatever. I don't remember. What I remember is that I got to hang around people who <i>really</i> liked math. And then I went home and kept on liking math, but stopped worrying about whether or not I was going to be the second coming of Galois, because I obviously was not.<p>I have found this attitude helpful, because if I were all hung up on the fact that I'm older, slower, and stupider than many of the folks I hang around with, my ego wouldn't last five minutes around here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35079"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35079</a><p>(HN veterans will have figured out, ten paragraphs ago, that this whole essay is basically an excuse to revisit that link from the old days. ;)",1344233005

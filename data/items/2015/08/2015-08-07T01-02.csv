Invest for the long term taking into account tax considerations and your risk appetite.  I have and it has served me well.<p>In general I&#x27;ve learned that reducing fees [0] and thinking carefully about how to allocate investments across asset classes [1] is a much more successful strategy than picking individual stocks. Also try to hold on to investments for more than a year so you&#x27;re taxed 15% on the profits rather than 30+% [2].<p>First thing you&#x27;ll want to do is consider your asset allocation.  I haven&#x27;t used this tool myself, as I used an advisor, [3] but I consider Vanguard trustworthy as they are owned by their customers and have a good reputation.  The purpose of a tool like this is to get a feel for how much you should be investing in equity vs bonds, vs real estate vs other exotic investments (hedge funds /private equity).  I took a similar test through a financial advisor years ago and found it useful.<p>Over the last 9 years, I&#x27;ve invested roughly in this order of priority:<p>1) 401k for company matching & tax benefits - total profit of ~70k over the years.  Starting from 0 balance 9 years ago, but recently have been maxing out contributions at ~17k per year
2) Exchange Traded Funds - SPY, DXJ, HEDJ.  Essentially diversified, low fee investments in the US Stock market, Japan stock market and Europe.  Total profit of ~30k over the years.
3) Bought a house, which I ended up renting.  On paper profit of ~100k, but transaction costs (costs to buy and sell) eat into a large part of it.  Long term it&#x27;s a good plan.
4) Invested in a few individual stocks, lost a few hundred dollars.
5) Invested in options on a few individual stocks, lost ~3k.  Learn about time decay before doing this.<p>Hope this helps!<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/sum/10.2469/faj.v66.n2.7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/sum/10.2469/faj.v66.n2.7</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_fees_expenses.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_fees_expenses.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_Unite...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire</a>",1438912618

10020429,comment,10019149,10019433,0,0,malandrew,,,"Let&#x27;s be honest here, feelings of being devalued have everything to do with putting capital ahead of personality. Capital comes in many forms and in the case of Tinder, from the heterosexual male perspective, the goal is to acquire sexual capital (i.e. &quot;fuck hot chicks&quot;).<p>However, as someone said, the door swings both ways, but the way women devalue men is far more subtle. From the perspective of the heterosexual female, the goal is to acquire mating capital (i.e. &quot;catch a husband or sugar daddy&quot;). What&#x27;s mating capital? It&#x27;s a man who is an ideal mate: good genes and conditions to be a provider (good job/career or money/power).<p>A guy being primarily interested in a woman because she has a great body and a pretty face is really no different than a woman being interested in a financially stable guy with a good job that is taller than her.<p>The double standard in articles like the one posted is that somehow it&#x27;s bad if heterosexual men are out to acquire sexual capital but somehow it&#x27;s totally acceptable for women to seek out mating capital.<p>How often do you see that it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for a women to reject a guy based on his height or the fact that he might be showing early signs of male pattern baldness. I&#x27;m tall and still have my hair, so I benefit from such &quot;de-valuing&quot;, but I also recognize that for the same crap that guys get judged negatively for.<p>I recently came out of a relationship where I was clearly not a good fit long term for my partner because we had different values, life goals and lifestyle preferences. For example, I&#x27;m poly and she was monogamous. I eventually persuaded her to date another guy, who ended up meeting her needs in all the ways I didn&#x27;t. Yet she still preferred me because I &quot;had my shit together&quot; and was a better option when it comes to raising a child. Because of that she couldn&#x27;t imagine being with the other guy.<p>At the end of the day, heterosexual women treat men as options too. The difference is that the capital that heterosexual women seek in men needs to be far more &quot;durable&quot; value than that which heterosexual men seek in women.",1438909531

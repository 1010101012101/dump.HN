Success typing considers all possible types a value can have. If a function returns either a bool or an int and you then pass that value into a function that accepts a string or an int, then the success typing checks out. It doesn&#x27;t mean your program is correct, but that it could possibly be correct. On the other hand, if you pass the &quot;bool or int&quot; value into a function that only accepts a string, the type checker will complain and you know for sure your program is incorrect. In other words, you will get false negatives but never a false positive.",1425693003

We figured the average person would store more than 30GB of data so the Amazon route wouldn&#x27;t work.

9160615,comment,9158156,9158156,0,0,leriksen,,,"I used to be an ATC (in Australia, 7 years), and there is definitely stress there, but its like being in an insane asylum - you don&#x27;t recognise that you, and everyone else, is mad.
There is also significant peer pressure to excel at your job. Not just be good, but to competently handle everything that comes. The regulations state that the purpose of ATC is to provide for the &quot;safe, orderly and expeditious operation of aircraft movements.&quot; They apply that religiously, and in that exact order. Mistakes in even the simplest procedure,or even phrasing of comms, are not tolerated. Mistakes are seen as evidence of failure to cope with the stress, and result in operators being swapped out ASAP.<p>I remember it took about 2-3 months, after I resigned, before I felt free of the stress. I consider knowing how to recognise stress growing within me to be the most valuable thing I took from that part of my career.<p>As an aside, it is possible there is a similiar mindset, or skillset amongst controllers. I remember very clearly the selection process was very focused on 2 things<p>- maths and logic<p>- multitasking<p>The hardest test in the selection process was a combined map course plotting task, where you had to accurately plot out a course of about 15-20 waypoints, but every 60 seconds the examiner would read out a logic problem &quot;if Jane wears blue on Tuesdays and green on weekends, what would she wear on the day before Monday ?&quot; - stuff like that. You had to focus on plotting, correctly, as many map points as possible, AND correctly answer the puzzles being read out. That was the most directly relevant skill to the actual job of being an ATC, awareness of the task in front of you, and the ability to understand and act on the &#x27;buzz&#x27; going on around you. They select for people who can perform accurately for multiple inputs, with time and cognition pressure.

I sometimes take flack for &quot;hating&quot; AWS (and I <i>do</i> hate some aspects of it), but I think it&#x27;s a great platform for incubating your service or proving a concept.

It&#x27;s great for random analytics jobs or other tasks that aren&#x27;t steady work tied to your core business.<p>It quickly starts to not make sense for services that have usage-driven growth patterns. AWS&#x27;s billing model just doesn&#x27;t work for this -- even though higher usage is discounted, it isn&#x27;t enough to overcome the skew of the model. Companies that have deployed on AWS often realize this too late: their business starts to take off, and they get crushed under giant AWS bills that would be disproportionate even at 50% off list.

At least for a usual semester&#x27;s amount of knowledge.<p>This was the case for me in physics (both undergrad and grad). Sitting in lectures barely scratches the surface of actively learning the material, but poring over mathematical details for hours solving homework problems and exam studying is how it all came together. Just like writing production code vs reading the language reference, or speaking a foreign language vs reading grammar rules and vocabulary lists.<p>So while this guy sat in many classes, unless he also put in the requisite time for homework and exams which would have allowed passable performance, he&#x27;s not really getting the full &#x27;Ivy League&#x27; education.",1425691417

  1 48-port top-of-rack switch : $5000 each
  374 4TB drive : $400 each
  22 500GB drive : $200 each
  2 CDU : $3000 each
  Rack + integration : $10000 each
</code></pre>
Total rack cost is $220,000 for 1.4PB or 700GB with basic 2-copy redundancy. Power draw is around 8kw, so 1 year of power is around $1100. Figure on a drive failure rate of 5%, memory 2%, PSU 3% and you might spend another $18,000 to stock spares. So besides your core datacenter costs, this solution will cost $239,100 to operate for a year. These costs only improve when you amortize the hardware over a 3 year period, which is standard.<p>Now how much does S3 cost to store 700GB for a year? $248,530.94.<p>Finally, consider bandwidth costs. I&#x27;ll crib from a recent comment of mine [1]:<p>1 gbit/s in a datacenter: $30,000 / year
500 mbit/s in S3: $142,540 / year<p>And that in a nutshell is why AWS doesn&#x27;t make financial sense at any significant scale. S3 makes sense if you aren&#x27;t really going to use all of that space: you can scale your spending up as your needs scale up. That isn&#x27;t the kind of problem Backblaze or other storage businesses have, there isn&#x27;t much chance of that storage going unused for any extended period of time. And if they architect their datacenter and service correctly, the down period between rolling in hardware and getting it utilized sufficiently to begin seeing a return on the investment should be minimal.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9139244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9139244</a>",1425691209

Where it becomes important is that if someone is fired &quot;with cause,&quot; then they are not eligible for the company&#x27;s typical severance benefits or unemployment compensation.<p>This, in turn, creates a perverse incentive for employers to fabricate a cause, or even to provoke the employee. Fortunately not at my present employer, but I have seen this happen and have also seen managers brag about it.",1425690135

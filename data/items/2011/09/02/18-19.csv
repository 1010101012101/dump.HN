Never ask that question.<p>Q.  Uh huh.  Then where do scientists get their priors?\nA.  Priors for scientific problems are established by annual vote of the AAAS.  In recent years the vote has become fractious and controversial, with widespread acrimony, factional polarization, and several outright assassinations.  This may be a front for infighting within the Bayes Council, or it may be that the disputants have too much spare time.  No one is really sure.<p>Q.  I see.

In other words the way a company is a good corporate citizen is by increasing the tax base. What's sad here is that Jobs was talking about payroll tax, not even sales tax. The right thing for Amazon to do is to collect that tax instead of cheating the kids of California. Also special deals for big companies (be it Amazon or Walmart) are always unfair to small companies that don't get the same breaks. If you're going to give a sales tax holiday to anyone it should be startup companies in California that can use the boost.",1314989393

It was briefly described in the original search paper they presented.<p>Of necessity, most machines that Google runs have 'private' (as in not directly addressable) addresses. This is how it seems that everyone runs things when they get above a certain number of servers.<p>Thirdly because one can assume that 'attacks' (whether they depend on XSS, overflows, or what not) are coming from the Interwebz its prudent to present the smallest possible attack surface on a machine which is being fed internet stuff. As you can imagine, those security constraints make for uncomfortable restrictions on what you can do in the 'front end', so a machine that is 'front end' has a different set of security constraints than a machine that is 'back end' (they are still constraints there of course but having gone through the filter of the front end machine which has greatly attenuated the possible exploit vectors).<p>I believe it is this armored 'front end' resource which is the scarce resource, but again, I've been gone over a year and things change quickly inside the 'plex.",1314989021

In a typical web box, spinning up an extra process takes very little resource since most process memory are shared with the parent process, and most web apps are IO bound, like waiting for network/file/DB, idling taking little CPU.  In a server box, many processes can be crammed in (like the shared hosting box).  But Google counts those duplicate processes as separate ones and charge the idle time these processes take.  That's why you see the outrageous bill.<p>What's more insane is that Google charges the process-instance-hour like a machine-instance-hour.

Once you learn these rules, reading Scala code becomes very manageable.<p>I found the Haskell code I saw to be clearer because it's type system allows one to omit types much more frequently, its indentation and function declaration style let you avoid a lot of curly braces and parenthesis, it's type class system involved less syntactic ceremony than Scala's implicits, point-free style allows one to omit Scala's underscores, and so on. All of these things added up so that in the end, I felt like Haskell just looked a lot nicer, much more concise and like the math it was trying to express.<p>I'm sure some of the authors of Scalaz could do a much better job than me explaining Haskell's advantages over Scala when writing functional code, since I am by no means a Haskell expert.",1314986666

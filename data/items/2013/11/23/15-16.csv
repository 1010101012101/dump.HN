6786324,comment,6784094,6786228,2,0,msandford,,,"Today for one or two people flying is often cheaper than driving unless you&#x27;re marathon drivers.  Once you roll a whole family in it still might be cheaper once you consider the food, hotel/motel, lost time due to infinite bathroom breaks, etc in addition to gas and miles on the car.<p>But you&#x27;ve made a good point; people made do with less back then and that should be factored in.<p>I think part of the problem is that the artificially low interest rates are turning &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; or &quot;traditional values&quot; on their head.  At 6-8% interest rate and 1-3% inflation saving money makes sense as you get a real interest rate that&#x27;s positive enough to make saving money smart.  Putting away money for future expenses is a good thing as future expenses are discounted today via the interest rate.  Living within your means is actually wise.<p>Today only a fool isn&#x27;t indebted because with interest rates below 1% and inflation at several percent people are effectively paying you to take loans.  Saving money for future expenses actually makes them more expensive; better to wait til you need the money and then borrow it so that you can reap the benefit of negative real interest rates, rather than pay it.  Because it doesn&#x27;t make sense to save money, people don&#x27;t and that means spending.  Good for the GDP numbers today, bad for conventional wisdom about money and especially bad for society&#x27;s ability to withstand credit shocks or employment shocks as nobody has a cash buffer to see them through the hard times.",1385222372

(I wouldn&#x27;t say robust but workable.)<p>In practice, at least in the last many decades, we have seen what happens when special interest groups get to write their own laws and regulations behind the scenes...often getting voted on in Congress before there&#x27;s time to even read the bills.<p>Maybe the solution is to somehow &#x27;democratize&#x27; the special interest groups? Well, I&#x27;ve basically advocated for awhile now that we need a larger group of representatives.

It&#x27;s hard to say really what would happen. The Crown (The Queen of Canada, although for all intents and purposes it really means the Governor-General) is an incredibly powerful position. The royal prerogatives, which are not really written down anywhere, since the Canadian (as well as the British) constitution is partially unwritten and based on convention, include appointing ministers (including the Prime Minister) and dismissing them at will, as well as calling and dissolving Parliament, declaring war, signing bills into law through Royal Assent, etc.<p>Conventionally, though, these powers are  used only through the advice of the Prime Minister, since the Prime Minister has some degree of democratic legitimacy (although interestingly enough, the Prime Minister is not elected directly by the people. The Prime Minister is Prime Minister only because he is the leader of the party that was chosen by the Crown to form government) and the Crown does not, since the Governor-General is appointed by the Monarch, with the advice of the Prime Minister, and the Monarch is obviously a hereditary position. Now, if the Crown were given democratic legitimacy, say through an elected head of state, suddenly the position is empowered and the stability of the system is called into question. Maybe the Crown decides not to sign a bill into law, or dismisses a minister, or dissolves Parliament for no reason, the Crown could say that he (or she) has the mandate of the people to do so, which is obviously bad for the country.<p>I&#x27;m not saying its necessarily bad for the Crown to be empowered like that, just that the system is stable and strong as it is, and it is not broken, so why fix it? It throws a lot of the political system into question and unbalances the delicate balance of our constitution.",1385220974

I made a portfolio website that showed what I could do, sent it to the director, and asked her if I could redesign her website. She agreed, and we went for it. Things went well, but one thing about starting your own business is   you really work closely with people, and if they are very difficult people, you have to find a way to deal with them.\n2)So I had my first success at an opportunity I found by leveraging my current connections. How to proceed from there? Offer to volunteer your services. I reached out to a local Americorps worker offering to volunteer my web design skills. We emailed back and forth for weeks and just recently say down for a meeting of 4 people in a small municipal government office.

I went to grad school in Chicago, and all the people I know who support Obama genuine think he&#x27;s a great candidate. Maybe not their ideal candidate, but one they can get behind that they think will be able to build a coalition.<p>If you look at American policy, it&#x27;s closely representative of the views of typical voters. High levels of welfare spending for the middle class (i.e. Social Security and Medicare?) What could be more representative of a voting population that consists to a large degree of middle aged middle class folks nearing retirement who won&#x27;t be burdened with the bill? Foreign wars? How many liberals urged Obama to intervene in Syria even after their ostensible opposition to Iraq? How many liberals supported arming Syrian rebels after complaining for years about arming anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan? On either side of the aisle, Americans are broadly willing to resort to military solutions. The drug war? I grew up in the 1990&#x27;s and remember being surrounded by suburban soccer moms who thought drugs were more evil than Hitler. The drug war was built on a solid coalition of social conservatives and Reagan Democrats that&#x27;s only now chipping at the edges as a younger generation becomes parents themselves.<p>First past the post has notable theoretical weaknesses, but that weakness tends to be entrenching the voice of the mainstream consensus, to the exclusion of minority viewpoints.<p>Americans love to bitch about the government, but very few would change anything in a substantial way. They argue over issues at the edges because that&#x27;s the only thing they disagree about. They might disagree with the amount of penalty BP should receive, but people on the right don&#x27;t want to get rid of the regulatory regime surrounding oil drilling, nor do people on the left want to abandon drilling entirely.",1385219025

You have to look at what every candidate brings to the table:  skills, experience, creativity, communication, etc.  It&#x27;s usually a mixed bag.<p>Some people are brilliantly creative but very difficult to get along with in an office environment, and others are extremely smooth and diplomatic but unproductive.  I&#x27;ve run into both kinds, though most people tend to be somewhere in between.<p>For a start-up situation, it seems to me you want to hire more from networking than from cold-call applications.  When a new hire is 25% of the work force, he or she is going to have a huge impact on the culture and productivity of the team and it&#x27;s very helpful to have met and interacted with them already.<p>When a new hire is 1/1000 of the work force, they&#x27;re going to have less of an impact unless they&#x27;re C-level, so you can afford to cold-hire based on established procedures.<p>I don&#x27;t see much value in statements like &quot;A-holes usually are not very introspective&quot;.  It seems this person has a very specific image of what an undesirable team member would be like, probably based on his own brief experience in the working world.<p>After a couple of decades of working experience, I find it hard to generalize what an &quot;a-hole&quot; would be.  It&#x27;s all over the spectrum, from good hard working team players to borderline or sociopathic personalities whom you feel like strangling.<p>I guess the bottom line is, leave your ego at the door while interviewing, try to see the value in each person, figure out what they bring to the table, and maybe get them in for a day or two to interact with the team and see if the chemistry is OK.",1385218998

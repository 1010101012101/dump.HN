I don't believe that's too much to ask from the system.<p>Since when did blowing up two bombs that cause 3 fatalities and 150+ persons to sustain often-horrific injuries <i>not</i> count as as mass event? It is not the prosecutor's fault that American servicemembers have caused the medical field to innovate for the past ten years on how to save lives in response to these attacks.",1366664384

It's hard.  But we are not without hope nowadays.<p>My one concern reading the article was of exploitation - does that 3x 98% accurate employee understand his/her value and how to negotiate appropriate compensation for it?

5591731,comment,5589269,5590106,3,0,lanaius,,,"The argument against this, and I make this as a jaded and struggling graduate student so accept that bias, is that there is no acceptable outlet for negative results. There is also no acceptable outlet for those who consistently produce negative results and so, as I'm sure everyone understands, there is tremendous pressure to produce positive and interesting results. We hear about the times that this is forced due to manipulation and falsification and this is never okay, but there are a great many times where it falls into a nebulous gray area. We double and triple check our code, verify simulation results, and run down the checklists but that never guarantees that we do not have such ""excel column errors"".<p>If data and code are open this is fantastic for science and progress because errors do not replicate and permute but it can be terrible for individual scientists and graduate students. As always, it comes down to money. If we are forced to correct or even worse retract a scientific publication, the community (both local and worldwide) bares down on you like a knife. The stakes are so high that not only is falsification lethal, in many cases honest mistakes can be lethal as well. Conversely one cannot take eternity flipping every stone to bulletproof every possible single problem and it can be very hard to identify which stones to check!<p>This is not a defense of closed work and closed data, but it's a realization that opening data and code is not a simple and straightforward process. There are severe and deeply embedded cultural problems that make post-publication sharing difficult.",1366664265

The problem is that when you put that display on a windows machine, you end up with a bunch of legacy windows software and web graphics content that looks unreadably small, followed unhappy users who return those fancy DP panels to your retailers.<p>Of course, the same thing is true of iOS and OS X software, which is precisely the reason ""Retina"" (as distinguished from arbitrary 200+ DPI hardware) displays are always shipped in resolutions that exactly double those of pre-existing devices.  So even though the legacy software doesn't handle it Apple, by controlling the framework, is able to make it work more or less seamlessly.<p>Dell and HP don't have that freedom, they need help from Microsoft, and Microsoft, well...

Why would paying your employees less than they deserve or less than is optimal encourage them to ""stay hungry.""

Our board - Fred, Brad Burnham, Rich Levandov (Masthead/Avalon), Habib Kairouz (Rho) and Curt Viebranz (COO) - was composed of folks who were long-time VC's and very strategic and senior, so they were comfortable with the idea that we should try to go big. We knew that our clients couldn't exploit our platform as well as we could. So, when Brad pushed us to really evaluate whether we couldn't build a bigger (and easier) business doing what our clients weren't doing well - using our platform to deliver and sell better targeted online ads - it didn't take long for all of us to realize that we should take the chance and pivot.<p>As for post-AOL ... a lot was going on at that time that makes it hard to analyze without the advantage of hindsight.

K. Prahalad, Venkat Ramaswamy<p>Yeah, it's a lot of stuff.  I won't say you need to read <i>all</i> of that, but everyone of those books is something that's influenced my thinking, and that I've learned a lot from.  If I had to pick one to start with, I'd say the Steve Blank book - <i>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</i>.  He does a pretty good job of giving an overview of market segmentation strategies, which you'll probably want to pursue if you're entering a crowded market.<p>After reading Blank, I'd go for <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> next, then the whole series by Trout, Ries and Rivskin, etc.  The Michael Porter stuff is good, but somewhat dry and academic. The <i>Understanding Michael Porter</i> book is a good introduction to his stuff that is a little easier to digest.<p>Also note a subtle, but important point... there are <i>two</i> different kinds of ""positioning* you'll hear people talk about in these kinds of discussions.  On the one hand, you have ""marketing positioning"" as described in the books by Ries, Trout, et al.  This is more about the <i>message</i> you send to the market about your firm and  your offerings.   Then you have Michael Porter ""structural positioning"" stuff that relates to how your firm ""fits"" in with your competitors vis-a-vis the ""five forces"" and the rest of Porterian strategic analysis.  One will influence the other, but they are really two different things.  Note that anytime somebody starts telling you anything about your ""positioning"".<p>And then you have what Bob Parsons (of GoDaddy fame) said ""Don't be afraid to enter a crowded market, just be better than everybody else"".",1366662383

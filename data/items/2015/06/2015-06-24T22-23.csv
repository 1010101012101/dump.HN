It&#x27;s literally just ease of bookkeeping.<p>When the accounting and law professions catch up with the tech I think we&#x27;ll see this all being much simpler, as with government and driving licenses and all the other pointless bureaucracy. But judging by how slowly bureaucracy moves, don&#x27;t hold your breath.",1435186740
9775031,comment,9771997,9774189,0,0,jameshart,,,"Setting questionable English &#x27;fjords&#x27; aside, the point isn&#x27;t that it would be <i>desirable</i> to have a population of 30 million in Ireland, but that it would be <i>possible</i>, without having the population density (and presumably poverty) of Bangladesh. You asked how a small island in the north atlantic could sustain more than 30 million people - well, South East England has a population density of about 1200 people per square mile, at a similar latitude. Transplant that same population density to Ireland and you&#x27;d fit 39 million people. So, if you want to know what an Ireland with 30 million people in it would look like, don&#x27;t imagine Bangladesh, think of Southeast England.<p>And Southeast England is still considered a pretty beautiful, green part of the world. It contains the South Downs and New Forest national parks, the Chiltern hills, and about 60% of the land in the region is actively farmed. Of course, in the middle of it you&#x27;ve got London, which accounts for the overall density. So yes, a populated Ireland would be <i>different</i>; Dublin and Belfast would be vastly different cities; - but it wouldn&#x27;t have stopped being the emerald isle if in an alternate history its population had reached 30m.",1435186740

I myself wanted linenoise, so I took it as a minor challenge and put up a pull-request with the feature.

A company doesn&#x27;t have to bring in $1 million in profit for investors who valued the company at $1 million to break even.<p>At very late stages, a company valuation is usually a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The valuation (which is different than market cap, but we&#x27;ll conflate the two for sake of explanation) in very late stage, non-growing companies, during times of slow economic growth is around 5-7x. If a company is growing quickly at the later stages (read: exponential growth curve) its P/E ratio (price/earnings ratio) could be, we&#x27;ll say, 100 on the public markets (100x). That&#x27;s really high, and would rarely happen unless the economy has really low interest rates (meaning less good places to put your cash, and you need to invest it somewhere anyway).<p>So, in other words, we give the company the benefit of the doubt and say they&#x27;ll be worth 30x EBITDA. That means they&#x27;d need to bring in about 20m in one year, which is about 400m in total donations. High for sure (the buyers must really believe in them), but not completely unreasonable. If, on the off chance, they start bringing in 1B in donations, and their take is 50m, the investors will earn a great multiple on their investment.

Synthesizing an index on-demand for those involves an extraordinary amount of random IO.<p>In postgres, a table&#x27;s data is stored in the &quot;heap&quot; (a disk file representing the table, itself; indexes are separate disk files). Consequently, you can do a sequential pass through the table, and then calculate/build the index in RAM (assuming you have sufficient &quot;maintenance_work_mem&quot;, in postgres configuration terms, otherwise you&#x27;ll spill to disk at this step, too), and then write it out sequentially as well — and <i>only then</i> walk the index depth-first to get to the leaf page that points to the disk page in the heap that contains the row you&#x27;re selecting.<p>(And even that random depth-first traversal of the index will probably actually happen in RAM, because postgres significantly defers to the kernel&#x27;s buffer cache to mitigate IO costs, and the index you&#x27;re traversing is pretty much guaranteed to be cached at this point.)<p>EDIT: It would apply to MySQL using InnoDB, however, as IIRC that does store table data on the leave pages of the primary key index. Can someone corroborate that?",1435183858

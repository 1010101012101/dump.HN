340837,comment,340658,340658,0,0,jgranby,,,"Almost all Mac OS X apps should not have installers or uninstallers. (Un)Installation is done by drag-and-drop, and that's how it's meant to be. If you absolutely need an installer, you can use Apple's installer, which if you run it a second time presents an option to uninstall. But the recommended and proper way of doing it is just to use drag-and-drop.<p>Limewire, the app mentioned, shouldn't have an installer or uninstaller (other, native P2P apps don't) for its Mac OS X version. As for preferences and other files created, they remain on your system if you drag an app to the Trash (i.e. uninstall it), which is also how Apple intended it. There are tools to remove all traces of an app, like AppZapper, but developers should always follow the HIG and distribute the .app bundle for dragging, zipped or otherwise.",1224729453

340827,comment,340086,340086,0,0,shimon,,,"I've been in a pretty similar situation recently.  I quit my day job in May, wanting to pursue my own projects.  For two months, I worked on my own projects, releasing something new every week or two.<p>That was fun and I learned a bunch of new things, but in retrospect it wasn't the best way to spend those two months.  I had planned to start looking for consulting work in month three, so I started emailing and calling people, arranging meetings, and putting the word out at geek gatherings.<p>A funny thing happened.  I started hearing a lot of great project ideas, some of which were potentially paid jobs and others which were just cool hacks or proto-startups.  And these came not just as spark of inspiration but with a person, or sometimes a small company, that actually cared about getting it built.  It took longer than I expected to actually get paid -- almost a month; it turns out consulting contracts aren't that dramatically easier to sell and execute than getting hired to a regular job, so plan on lots of slow interpersonal cycles -- but in the meantime I was amply supplied with great projects and some good partnerships.  Many of these are on my back burner now, behind the work that pays well but dominates, and I mean DOMINATES, my schedule.  On the bright side, timing my every minute has dramatically increased my stamina -- I can do a lot more work in a day than I ever have before.  This will come in handy with whatever I do.<p>Anyway, here's my advice: start looking for consulting work immediately, and try to get quickly to a point where you can pay your living expenses on 15 billable hours a week.  By the way, you might think this is ""not even two full time work days"", but let me assure you that when you can't count lunch, news.yc, stupefying meetings, etc. against the clock, this will feel like a huge work load.  Do not promise anyone 20 or more hours a week until you have tested your capacity; there's a lot you can optimize, and you will.<p>The regular consulting work will help you develop discipline, improve your stamina, and keep you in touch with people.  In your spare time, which again you should try to preserve, do whatever projects draw your fancy.  Get in the habit of soliciting ideas at parties, from family friends, etc. and see where you can take them in your spare time.  Then when you find one that works for you, and some people who might make good partners, deploy the rest of your cushion (the one you didn't spend because you were paying your living expenses off of consulting) and take the plunge.<p>Good luck!",1224728797

340805,comment,340317,340573,0,0,mdasen,,,"To be honest, neither of these companies (Slicehost and Jungle Disk) seem like the type that move with the economy.  JungleDisk is small enough to be self-funded and Slicehost doesn't seem like the ""1. Makesomething, 2. ???, 3 Profit!"" type of company.  In fact, they both have business models that are perfectly sound and don't rely on things like cornering the market (Twitter, Facebook, etc.).  They've just created something of real value that people do pay for.<p>Buffet's words only ring true when the people who own a company (shareholders) freak out and are worried that the world is coming to an end and will sell for cheap because they think nothing will ever be good again.  That doesn't seem like the Jungle Disk or Slicehost folks.  Both camps seem really grounded in reality - providing something that's a great value with the fit and polish that just make it a joy to use.  And a sound business plan of charging people for stuff.  They both know that they can ride out this recession.<p>I think that Rackspace is more of the scared one in this situation. Amazon is generating a lot of buzz and grabbing a lot of customers with their EC2 service - especially now that they have persistent storage.  Rackspace tried their hand at that space with Mosso and, well, failed.  The way that Mosso and others (MediaTemple) ""automagically"" and ""infinitely"" scale your apps is BS.  Likewise, Jungle Disk gives them an opportunity to cut into S3.<p>Virtualization is a huge threat to Rackspace.  Their business was built on reliability.  When you can just take Xen snapshots and set an auto-restore to a new box when one fails, why choose Rackspace?  Because you have an excess money problem?  The cornerstone of their business is starting to matter less for clients.  I even convinced my boss to let us try running on EC2 and have a cron job monitor the server, create the snapshots, boot new instances, assign ips, etc, in the case it finds the server down.  That's a huge threat to Rackspace.<p>By buying up these companies, they make sure they're at the head of the space and can create and sell such automated packages to their customers.",1224727450
340804,comment,340749,340749,0,0,ggrot,,,"The argument the demonstrators make is that the SiteKey protection is useless.  I would counter that this is not the case.  Their demonstration does illustrate that the man in the middle attack can work for a small number of phishing attacks.<p>The attacker gives up something in order to pull the man in the middle attack off that they wouldn't otherwise need to.  The server that is running the attack has to actually make an http request to Bank of America in real-time.  It need not be that exact server, but some server has to do this.<p>If it is a real web server, Bank of America could do interesting things if they are suspicious of the login, for example probing port 80 (in real-time or asynchronously).  Or, keeping a database of ip addresses that are known to be ISPs versus datacenters (presumably the demonstration was done from an ISP ip address).<p>If the attacker somehow re-routes the request through a real ISP in real-time, it becomes easier to track the attacker in the real (legal) world.  Now all of the sudden the ISP knows the address of the attacker, can track down the machine doing the attacking, etc.<p>In either case, Bank of America can detect the attack very quickly because of a large number of unique connections from the same IP address.<p>If the attacker goes one step further and re-routes the sitekey requests through a botnet, then bank of america loses alot of defenses.  The botnet is on real machines on real ISPs and always a different IP address.  But this makes it much harder for the attacker to pull off because they have to set up a botnet.",1224727337

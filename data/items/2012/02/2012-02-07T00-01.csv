I'm not saying to let every feature for no-member, but saying +1 to an artist is important in a new social network.<p>2. I <i>hate</i> it when the page loads and I'm aiming at a video in the screen, but  it then randomly starts to scroll somewhere else, and it'd make me mistakenly click on the wrong video. To use the website, I had to let it load the page, count 1-2 in my head (while it'd scroll I don't know where randomly), and then I'd click on the video I want.<p>3. About the connect with facebook and share with facebook. For some reasons, it really scare me the way it's done. It should somewhat tell me what action does what. For instance, after registrering, there's a popup saying ""Now share your profile on Facebook"" [share] [cancel]. Will [cancel] cancel my registration? I had no idea.<p>Otherwise, great job! I'll use it and look forward to it :)<p>About the #1, I think it requires maybe a bit more explanation. I wanted to say ""This artist is good"", but didn't want to be involved into all the facebook connect, creation process, etc. Would be good to have the user helps promote the video but only force him to create an account if really necessary.",1328576313

3559957,comment,3559631,3559765,40,0,nostrademons,,,"It's a really complicated question.<p>My dad went the other route - he had an MIT Ph.D in nuclear chemistry and gave up his career to be a dad.  He was always, always there to play LEGO with me or take me to the playground or drive me around to after school activities.  And I really, really appreciated that - I probably appreciate it more now that I'm grown and he's dead.<p>The thing is - he still had something to prove, and because he had given up his professional life for me, he transferred that need to prove something onto me.  And so for most of my childhood, I felt like I <i>had</i> to do well in school, and when I grew up it was up to me to win that Nobel Prize that he never had a shot at.  And it went like that until I was in around middle school, at which point I basically said ""Fuck that shit"" and started sabotaging myself just to prove to everyone that I wasn't this super-genius who was destined to change the world.<p>And that wasn't really fair to me either.<p>I don't think it's really a matter of outcomes, of affording the big mansion in a gated community.  I think that every kid deserves to have a dad who can be proud of who he is and what he's accomplished in life.  If you can honestly feel that you're not <i>giving up</i> anything to be with your kids, but rather <i>gaining</i> something, then you should do it.  But if you would otherwise be bitter and resentful for what you couldn't accomplish in life - it's better to have an absent dad than a bitter one.",1328576122

Quite a natural approach to prioritize that order depending on what stage the project is, early, mid or late. It requires a continuous refactoring but in the business man's point of view it's rework.

I have tried many to-do list apps out there, but the story always ends the same way.<p>I have figured out exactly what I need in a to-do list app, but none exist that do what I need to my knowledge.<p>So I want to build it. I don't want to make a full-blown app, I want only to make a small PHP script that does what I need. I do not want to work with databases, please.<p>The idea is this. A single page with a max number of 7 tasks that will automatically delete after 7 days with the option to save 1 task indefinitely. A max number because having to pick and choose my tasks is more like real life where I have to pick and choose my time. Other apps give me unlimited tasks to do in a finite amount of time. Automatic deletion because, if I didn't get it done in 7 days, it probably wasn't that important to me. If it was really, really important, then I can save one task for as long as I need.<p>Sketches of the general visual outline with annotations:

And while an arrangement with a VC could potentially grant them the ability to fire a founder, it doesn't necessarily have to, and I've seen plenty of cases where the founders did not agree to such terms (especially in cases of VCs signing on with well-established companies).",1328575418

Failing teaches you what not to do. Instead people should be learning from success. Do your homework, put out something based on educated research and focus on what is working and repeat it. Learning from successes gives you something you can use again and again. Learning from failure gives you a one time lesson in what not to do which is far less valuable. There's more than enough information floating about on what works that people can easily access and fit to their needs. Even people with completely revolutionary ideas that have never been done before can benefit as lessons in marketing, design, and coding techniques apply to everyone.<p>If you've ever met an Imstant Millionaire you'll notice they don't learn from their mistakes. There's always some excuse and enough blame to put on everyone but themselves. In the end they always end up pursuing another bad idea in the same way somehow convincing themselves that this time it'll be different. I've come across a bunch of these people and often they're working on several doomed ideas at once, going about each the same way.<p>As for the legit hacker I really wonder what they really learn. You may be perfectly right but if I put myself in those shoes my mind works in a way that if my 30 day app failed I'd blame it on bad design, not enough buzz, or somehow blame my code for not being objected oriented or functional or maybe I just didn't use the right framework.<p>Now, despite my disagreement with failure as a goal I think people with that mindset are much better off than others. The problem is the people I'm talking about don't have this mindset. They simply read about how someone else did it ans think ""me too!

They also have a mobile client on nearly every platform. They recently added chat sync to their client so that you can see your missed messages when you log in from another device.<p>Example:<p>Someone left you 10 messages on your home computer while you were afk.<p>You log in from your phone and as soon as you do, your missed conversations pop up as well as any chat windows + messages you had open on your computer before leaving. It also has an option to push your messages to email on the mobile clients when you're offline and I believe there is a way to do it for the desktop client as well (just not as obvious).<p>---<p>I also think it generally stores your messages by default until you log back in (if you're offline on all devices) as well. I generally get a storm of chat popups if I have been offline for a day or two on all devices as soon as I log onto trillian again. I don't think I would always trust it to work, but it generally seems be fine for most protocols.<p>It supports most protocols (xmpp/jabber, msn chat, google chat, aim, icq, yahoo, facebook chat, twitter, irc and some others).<p>The only annoyance of trillian is the free version has some ads for their products (a recent decision by them to reevaluate what their call their ""pro"" version). They went from making their free version lack a few features to having everything except their cloud chat history sync backup and making their ""pro"" version a subscription instead of a one time payment. I regret that they went the subscription route and ads showing up occasionally in the chat window, but I still find it's better than other clients. It's 12 dollars a year though to buy the pro version.<p>It does have built in encryption for chatting, but it's sadly not OTR (<a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/</a>) and only works with users on trillian. There is an unofficial OTR plugin out for trillian, but it's always been sort of buggy and I don't think it has been supported by the developer for a while. There is a fork of the original, no longer supported trillian OTR plugin out (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/trillianotr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/trillianotr</a>) so it might be working better now.

As such, it creates a financial system that encourages bureaucracy that is intended to look like something is being done about it, when in fact the intent is to maintain the current status as long as possible.

So, the most important parts of the application for me are the questions about the founders' backgrounds and the most impressive things they've done.   We're looking for evidence that the founders are smart, effective, and determined.  If you can't go through your application and point to evidence for all three, that's bad.  Don't be shy about telling us why you're good, but don't write a bunch of meaningless marketing speak either.<p>The first question I usually ask is something like ""so, why this idea?""  I'm happy when founders say things like ""we wanted this for ourselves"" or ""we understand this space better than anyone else because of Y"".  We ask about parts of the business we have concerns about, like market size, competitive differentiation, growth plans, business model, etc.  In particular, I'm interested in seeing how founders react to new information, and if they're flexible while still standing their ground on things they believe in.  If I've already thought of everything a founder has to say about his/her company, that's bad.<p>It's important to remember that most investors are optimists by default.

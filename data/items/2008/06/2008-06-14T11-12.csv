Alas, all this failed, till I chanced onto something interesting. Here is how I manage getting up early-ish.<p>After numerous unsuccessful attempts my body just gave up...but I wasn't quite done yet. So, the alarm was set for 7 AM and every morning I would get up to switch it off and promptly go back to sleep. My body and I had reached a compromise. I was allowed to set any big hairy audacious goal and my body was free to disregard it just as long as it went through the motions to humour me. Soon enough the body started getting up a few minutes early just to switch off the alarm and then took its own time going back to sleep. Now, it gets up at 6.30AM to switch off the 7 AM alarm (lol) then it sleeps till 8 AM and is fresh as a daisy for the rest of the day. I sneakily fooled my body! You can too...<p>Next goal 6.00 AM!",1213444186

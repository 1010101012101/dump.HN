781038,comment,780522,780837,0,0,agmiklas,,,"I think the easiest way to fix the problem is to do exactly what you suggest -- decouple a person's immigration status from their employer.  I'd do this by scrapping the H1B program and instead simply offer a green card to every person that has a letter of employment from a US company.  The government could continue to apply various filters (total quotas, country-specific quotas, educational or experience requirements, language competency, etc). [1]  However, at soon as a person is admitted to the US, their immigration status should have absolutely nothing to do with their employer.<p>Under this system, a company can't pay an immigrant less than their worth, since the person is free to work at any business that is willing to pay more.  It also fixes a whole bunch of other subtle problems that come up with an employment-based immigration system.<p>For example, right now once a H1B holder applies for a GC, they can neither changes companies nor change their job title (e.x. be promoted) without abandoning their GC application.  Since this process can take years and thousands of dollars, immigrants are not only shackled to their sponsoring company, but to a particular job (and often pay-level) within that business.<p>I should point out here that I'm Canadian that may one day be working in the US... so perhaps I have a bit of a pro-immigrant bias here.<p>[1] Personally, I'd get rid of most of these too, but that is the subject of a different rant.",1251062805

And the attacker will continue to be able to extract microsecond-accuracy data from your timing attack. You need profoundly accurate hardware and a real-time operating system. Your attacker needs… more measurements.<p>Caching is equally unlikely to play a role.

In the constant-time algorithm proposed by Nate Lawson and others, the only array lookup is the incremented value of a for loop (i.e., constant-time). The other operations are XOR and OR, both of which are constant-time.<p>Branch prediction doesn't come into play because a constant-time comparison doesn't involve conditionals until all the data has been compared.<p>A constant-time implementation of AES?

A computer model is only as good as the software it runs on and the assumptions about the real world that this software makes.<p>If as scientist, you want to test assumptions, it is better not to rely on complex computer models that hide all their assumptions under the hood, but to make simpler or as simple as possible theories that can test assumptions one at a time. If you know all your assumptions are reliable then you can cobble them all together in computer models. And of course keep everything open so that others can check your work.<p>One of the most obvious and disastrous examples of failure of computer models is the economic crash that just happened. A bunch of bankers and rating agencies had a lot of fancy complex computer models that proved that their mortgage backed securities could not possibly lose value. So the securities were rated AAA, and everyone treated them as essentially risk free. Well we all know what happened next.",1251061460

If that's correct, then the low-level db lib <i>is an ORM</i> in Python. In which case SQLObject/SQLAlchemy probably just harnesses those features and adds some additional cream on top.",1251061430

I know that gas costs around $0.96/L in this area at this time of year, so my commuting costs about $40 per month in fuel.<p>I use this line in my budget, and hence pay less attention to exactly when I refill my tank - and know that any amounts I spend on gas above this number are somewhat discretionary.",1251061423

It's a live object in a small, closed world that is consuming a portion of a finite amount of resources. Consider the data in any kind of database - a traditional RDBMS or a triple store, data in such  structures is much larger and cannot be loaded into RAM for querying, so indexes must be formed somewhere for querying. However you slice it, there will be a mismatch because of this scale difference. I recently wrote a utility class to automatically map objects to resources in an arbitrary RDF graph. The insight I gained from this was to consider that there exists a large, universal data model (defined in RDF in this case, could be defined in any way) that contains all the data, but is too large to load into ram. Querying this structure leads to a set of resources that represent the data that needs to be ""alive"" in objects in ram at the moment and then this data can be loaded into the objects, manipulated and serialized again. This is a bit of a rambling reply for something that is unlikely to be read but the point I am trying to make is that in data modeling we like to think of an open world of data but the reality of writing computer programs is working with a very small closed world of the data in RAM and object mapping highlights this issue, which is a difficult problem in general but which has numerous easy, ad hoc solutions.",1251061284

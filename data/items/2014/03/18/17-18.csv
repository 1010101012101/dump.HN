7423706,comment,7419553,7420575,1,0,malandrew,,,"<p><pre><code>    &quot;One of the many things wrong with the &quot;package manager&quot; \n    paradigm is that it encourages people to write software \n    which is a tangled web of dependencies. Software should \n    have few third-party dependencies, that makes maintenance \n    and porting a lot easier.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOr it means that you can share the fruits of your porting with others.<p>If you and I work on a project that depends on module foo, only one of us needs to port foo to platform bar once for both of us (and everyone else) to gain compatibility with platform bar with respect to our dependencies.<p>What you want instead is a way to have package managers support defining cross platform modules so that bar doesn&#x27;t have to be forked and published as an entirely separate module.<p><pre><code>    &quot;The primary reason why people did not, could not upgrade to \n    Python 3 was because they had to wait for all the dependencies \n    of their apps to be ported. Many are still waiting.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThen the problem is a lack of tooling to aid with porting the code to the new platform. Creating a tool that parses code into an AST and analyzes the code to help define how it can be made compatible with the future version of a language should be a tractable problem for 1-2 developers.<p>At the end of the day package managers are first and foremost social software whose role is to aid meatware in achieving eventual consistency. We&#x27;ve only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible in this respect.",1395165537

7423703,comment,7422515,7423489,19,0,azakai,,,"I am a FOSS advocate as well, but I disagree that this announcement is a bad thing.<p>First, Mozilla has and does assist in the creation of FOSS game engines and tools (Gladius, CubicVR, help to various web ports like JSMESS and various open source game engines, etc.).<p>Second, even the LGPL shows that absolute avoidance is not always the best thing to do regarding closed-source code. Reality is more complex. Sometimes interoperability with closed-source code is good for everyone including free software.<p>In particular, a big benefit for free software here is that Unity games can now run on the web, an open platform. Before they required a proprietary plugin that did not work on Linux or BSD, but as JS+WebGL they can run on those platforms. (Yes, the games are proprietary, but visiting websites using proprietary code is basically unavoidable, both on the client and server-side. At least we can do it using FOSS tools now.) So this helps support free software OSes.<p>A final point, while the Unity engine is a proprietary codebase, they also have lots of code that is FOSS, see their github page. They are also working with even more open source code for the WebGL port, as it uses emscripten.",1395165524

7423694,comment,7419837,7420459,2,0,jjoonathan,,,"Yes, in many circumstances it is advisable or necessary to perform calculations in front of the analog front end. Even the simplest &quot;digital&quot; transceiver amplifies and mixes before the AFE. However, I don&#x27;t believe any of that is relevant to our criticism of the article, which focuses explicitly and extensively on performing calculations with cams, gears, and shafts at an &quot;infinite level of resolution&quot; and why the author thinks this is supposed to be better than digital computation:<p>> There are no least significant digits dropped, and answers are continuous rather than dependent on “for-next” clock-driven computing cycles.<p>Even if the article had talked about improving accuracy by skipping the digitizing step for gyroscopes, wind vanes, etc, his claim would not have been credible. It&#x27;s not terribly difficult to digitize mechanical motion to the subatomic level (AFM is from the &#x27;80s) and many modern data sources (ring-laser gyroscopes, information acquired from remote ships and satellites) could not be coupled to the mechanical computer in a way that could be expected to beat digitization error.<p>A GPS chip likely has something to gain from correlating in front of the analog front end but a firing computer does not. You pay a fixed cost to go in and out of a digital representation, but with analog you keep paying for each calculation and, given that one of these firing computers weighed 3000lbs, I expect that this application saw digitization errors that were tiny next to calculation errors.<p>Thanks for being thorough, but I see your post as a tangental point rather than as a counterargument.",1395165462

To do that we need to continue to pack more and more transistors on chips.<p>As you pointed out, todays problem is not the transistor size, but rather it is the energy consumption. Both dynamic and static power are not decreasing proportionally with node size, and therefore we have gotten to the point of asking &quot;why add them if we can&#x27;t use them?&quot;. This is the problems of the power wall and the observation that we must continue to turn off more and more of our silicon if we can&#x27;t scale dynamic and static power characteristics of transistors with their size. This problem threatens the well being of all semi conductor companies.<p>Do you think that Intel will just surrender and go bankrupt? If they don&#x27;t defeat this problem, soon companies will have no reason to buy chips from Intel. So what if they have 2x the cores on the chip if you can only keep half of them active? Without breakthroughs in energy storage and heat dissipation, how can google/apple/... create exciting new compute devices if the processors continue to sip as much power as they did two years ago? Do we decrease the compute capabilities (i.e. give up on the additional transistors) or run them slower than we are used to and is that acceptable?<p>There is a lot of interest in continuing Moores law.

But I do want to push back a little bit on Google Now cards being necessarily depressing.<p>I recently traveled up to Boston on a short hybrid work/vacation trip with my wife. When we were headed to the airport, Google Now had a card letting me know my flight was on time, and letting me know when I had to leave to make it to the airport on time. It was information I could have otherwise looked up, but it surfaced that information for me, and it was nice.<p>When we landed in Boston, we wanted to contact our hotel to verify the check in time and ask if we could leave luggage there for the day if necessary. When I pulled my phone out, there was already a card with the hotel address, travel time, and contact info. Again, stuff I could have looked up (check my email to verify hotel name, look up number, call), but it was nice to have it there and ready for me.<p>When I head to work in the morning, Google Now has a card for my commute, along with notifications about any accidents that may impact my travel. I also live far enough away that there are a few very different routes I can take, and day to day one or the other may be the best. Finding out my commute needs to go a different way, or I should plan for it to be a bit longer (or shorter, sometimes!) doesn&#x27;t seem depressing to me.<p>I keep a pretty close eye on how Google is using my information, and if I begin to feel like it has crossed a line from mutual benefit (helping me, and deriving value as well) to something more one-sided (exploiting me for value), I hope I won&#x27;t prove to have been naive, but in the meantime, this is something that really seems to make my life better.

That&#x27;s usually what sexism is. What A experiences.<p>> But A could be mistaken<p>In theory - yes. In practice, chances of that are low, especially in tech. You see, tech is <i>such</i> a sexist environment, that if <i>anyone</i> experiences sexism in your company, it&#x27;s probably there. Even if no one experiences it it&#x27;s probably there. Unlike Communism in the 50s, though, it&#x27;s no biggie. You listen, try to understand, identify and empathize and fix whatever needs fixing. That&#x27;s not &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot;, but realizing that this is a very serious problem in tech right now, and all you need to do is try and fix it. No one is getting blacklisted or going to jail.<p>And it&#x27;s not a &quot;taint&quot;, unless the allegations are of something far more serious than simple sexism (like sexual harassment).<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why would anyone, when faced with the accusation that some of their employees feel unsafe or bullied, would try to fight this. If someone tells you the atmosphere in your company makes them uncomfortable, you better listen. You shouldn&#x27;t take offense by someone calling you sexist because chances are that you are. Why? Because we are flooded with sexist ideas starting in kindergarten and everywhere else since. Think of it is a vestigial social appendage. Everybody has it. It&#x27;s ingrained in us. If someone points that out to you, you should be thankful, because you&#x27;re seeing something that you&#x27;re not accustomed to seeing. It can be truly eye opening and enlightening, and unlike some interesting fact about the big bang, this knowledge can make living in our society a lot better for everyone.",1395164341

It goes beyond just knowing the registers and the mnemonics and explains in a fantastically clear way all the implicit work that&#x27;s going on behind the scenes, even in assembly code. From the stack to data segments and direct video control, I learned more about how computers work from this book than from my entire college Computer Science program. And I didn&#x27;t even have an assembler to actually try any of the code at the time I read it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the book would still hold up from a practical perspective, as it does focus very much on MS-DOS-specific interrupts.

If you really want your secrets to be safe you wouldn&#x27;t use any closed source code at all and would take security precautions to secure the code you do use. Unfortunately we live in a time when closed-source software is the norm and too many people think having a secure, open, communications infrastructure is too complicated and don&#x27;t quite understand the reasoning behind it (thankfully that attitude seems to be changing a little), but I hope one day we&#x27;ll look back on this time and wonder what we were thinking by allowing digital goods to be closed source.<p>With 3D printers, neural implants, augmented reality, food and organ printers, and the age of automation, what the future holds is a digital realm that&#x27;s going to be very scary for people who understand it, especially if the infrastructure is completely owned by corporations and un-trustable governments and even a small amount of the source is closed. I mean look around the room and think of all the things that could be augmented or replaced with 3D printed components.. Why have a physical laptop in front of you when you can augment the key board, 25 screens, and everything else? Not only that, but you can do it for nothing if you know how to code it.<p>We can already print organs and I don&#x27;t think it will be too long until we can print good tasting food, but what if you execute some code on your food printer that prints a steak with anthrax in it?

Hmm.  I may as well guess your technique openly:<p>Your technique must be something unexpected, and seemingly unrelated to &quot;actions that fraudsters would normally be careful not to give themselves away with.&quot;  So I&#x27;m going to guess that the technique is to analyze the linguistic traits of each user&#x27;s password.  Most people reuse passwords, and if the fraudsters share a similar cultural background then the password has a decent chance of giving away the fact that a particular user is from that same cultural background, e.g. if the password contains a foreign dictionary word in their native tongue yet their their purported home address is in a completely different country.  That sort of thing.<p>Or if the same group of fraudsters keep reusing the same passwords, or even parts of their previous passwords, then that would probably be enough to accurately detect them.  Most people who don&#x27;t use a password manager tend to reuse substrings of their prior passwords, so they end up leaving a pretty distinctive identity &quot;footprint&quot; by the type of passwords they choose.  Their passwords are likely to share a similar structure, such as always consisting of two words followed by two numbers, for example, or always starting their passwords with two symbols like %#.<p>And of course, if the fraudsters became aware that their password was giving themselves away, they&#x27;d trivially dodge the detector in the future.<p>Hmm.

7423230,comment,7422988,7423155,1,0,zacinbusiness,,,"See that&#x27;s one of the problems with current tech and these watch devices. First of all, it will take a whole lot of convincing to make me buy another watch as I currently own an $800 Seiko that&#x27;s nearly 15 years old and I&#x27;ve never had to change the battery (because it&#x27;s kinetic). Second, if I DID buy a new watch it would take even more convincing to get me to take it off more than once every few years just to charge it. A normal watch lasts at least a year on a battery, and a kinetic watch such as mine literally never &quot;winds down&quot; unless I stop moving for months at a time. And finally, a watch as a display device is fine, but I&#x27;m simply not going to use it as an input device. Thus, I can see context-sensitive info on my watch (which is cool, I readily admit) but I still have to whip out the smart phone or laptop or tablet in order to really do much with that data. Now I&#x27;m not saying that someone won&#x27;t make a good interface, but I just think the physical size limitations of making a watch that doesn&#x27;t look and feel ridiculous will make any such interface very (very) difficult to pull off.",1395162382

8602183,comment,8600716,8601289,0,0,Iftheshoefits,,,"This just can&#x27;t be emphasized enough. My view is that this view should be expanded to include most of management. They are in a different social class, because they are employees the company values more than the employees who do the work of the company (e.g. produce products, maintain software, whatever). HR is valued more for all the reasons listed. Management serve a similar purpose, but in a more front-line kind of way, and also are guardians of the only resource that matters in a company (direct and indirect expenses).<p>I suppose it makes me a cynical person but my view is that unless I have a pre-existing personal relationship, I assume that anybody in management views their employees as tools to use for their own political ambitions within the company, whether they need a scapegoat to cover their own incompetence or a proxy to claim glory and credit for jobs well done.",1415894386

8602181,comment,8600716,8600716,0,0,paulhauggis,,,"This sort of behavior at Amazon does not surprise me.  If you are a third-party seller, they will eventually use your own sales data to go around you, buy whatever you are selling at bulk, and put you out of business.<p>This past September, they had major server issues, which cost sellers lots of money in sales.  They refuse to admit it.<p>As a seller, you also don&#x27;t own your customers (you are given the privilege of selling to amazons customers).  Which means that at any point in time, Amazon could take it all away and all of the hard work you put into pleasing the people buying your products goes to waste.  They have been recently making it more and more difficult for the average user to even continue their business. So many people that have been selling for years are prevented from continuing without paperwork from distributors (which as I&#x27;ve seen in the past, is just a trick to find out where they can compete with you)<p>With thaw business practices, they should have been out of business years ago.",1415894374

8602176,comment,8600716,8601540,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I have also been approached by recruiters for Amazon.  The first time, I asked a few specific questions about the work culture there, and the response did not answer a single one directly.  It was 100% evasion and redirection.<p>Among the specific questions:<p>- Under what circumstances would I be required to repay relocation assistance?<p>- Would a non-compete agreement be required?<p>- Does Amazon use an employee evaluation system similar to Microsoft&#x27;s old &quot;stack ranking&quot;?<p>- What is the median employee tenure (a.k.a. how bad is the turnover rate)?<p>The first recruiter pleaded ignorance for some of my questions, so I helpfully provided him with some links to articles still available on-line from nationally-known business publications.  These claimed (with references and fact-checking) that Amazon had the second-worst turnover of all companies where that statistic could be calculated, it does employ a variant of stack ranking, and that Amazon frequently pursued former employees for their relocation and NCA after leaving, even when it was Amazon&#x27;s decision to fire them.<p>As I already knew all this, my goal was mostly to help convince that guy to stop being a recruiter for Amazon, and go take an easier job recruiting for someone else.  I didn&#x27;t exactly consider that the company would probably sue him for leaving, or maybe even fire him for not getting me to apply, then sue him for getting fired.<p>Always do your research on the prospective employer, kids.",1415894325

This was a separate issue from Discover. On the black & white e-ink Kindles, we had added a feature where users could buy from the device. The data was really bad - most advertisers paid thousands of dollars in minimum spending, and would sell a fraction of that spending in product sales. Amazon doesn&#x27;t share that data with advertisers, and the SVP was basically telling the team not to share sales data because nobody in their right mind would buy a $10K or $20K ad if they ended up only selling $500 in product.",1415894303

Performance improvement plans are not for performance improvement. They are for firing employees. Management already formed an irreversible negative view. It is too late.<p>2. You cannot win a case against the company. Because a) companies have more resources and b) even if you do win then other companies will mark you as a troublemaker. Getting hired is going to get a lot harder.<p>3. If you insist on fighting then do document everything. Supposedly you need a few months of notes. In other words, being called a slur once or twice does not make a hostile work environment. If HR is unaware then the company is not liable, but if you share your notes then you won&#x27;t win the case anyway. There are a few narrow forms of discrimination that are claimable but the best option is to keep your head down and find a new job.<p>4. Do not document anything on company software or networks. My friend got to learn what Data Loss prevention software really did.<p>5. HR has zero legal obligation to keep your secrets. Their job is to identify threats to the company. They literally get paid to share your secrets.<p>Bonus anectode: I went to HR and asked &quot;Are you legally required to keep things I tell you confidential? For example, if I tell you I want to leave then will you tell my boss?&quot;<p>Her answer to my second question was no, but guess what my boss and I talked about the next day!",1415894271

The ones that imposed the Dublin treate[1] which effectively turned Greece and Italy into an huge refugee camp overnight? These countries to give a damn about <i>aliens</i> too.<p>Those Iraqi, Iranian, Pakistani (soon Syrians to be expected en masse) refugees do not risk their lives to come to Greece. They want to go to Germany, Sweden, France, the UK etc. But since Greece&#x27;s PM (Kostas Simitis[2]) signed that treaty, Greece is <i>forced</i> to make front on the huge number of refugees arriving from wars that NATO (mostly UK and US) make directly or indirectly (see Syria) in the middle east without any financial or other kind of help from the EU, because of this treaty...<p>As a result, in Greece we have more than 2+ millions refugees. The government has run a disgraceful program (ironically named &quot;Xenios Dias&quot; - loosely translated as Foreigner Zeus, linked to the ancient Greek belief that foreigners should be protected by Zeusm thus sheltering a stranger was some kind of obligation), which in practice means take all refugees are taken away and put on guarded jails until they die out of <i>something</i>[3]. The rise of the Nazi party in Greece, which has close ties with the current government on so many levels, is partly because of the Dublin Treaty and the incapability of Greece to handle the situation.<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant...<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation#Criticism</a><p>[2] Konstantinos Simitis is considered along G.

He was the PM when Greece along with Godlman Sachs falsified the Greek statistics in order for Greece to enter Euro, which led to it&#x27;s current situation along with other strings of scandals.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=424639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=424639</a> (Greek article but take a look at the picture).",1415893896

There are the US, the rest of the world, the EU, the NATO, the Five Eyes, other trade agreements and even lots of special agreements (partly known for a long time, partly due to the Snowden revelations) with countries such as France, Germany and others, like Austria (there is a UN HQ, next to a espionage outpost by the NSA).<p>We now know that pretty much every US embassy also has a lot of SIGINT going on, same for US military bases (they still exist!) in Germany. There are &quot;privately&quot; owned places by the NSA, secret agreements with governments, companies, institutions, etc.<p>When a country secret laws (or interpretations of such), operates secret prisons, outposts, spies on embassies and international institutions, operates spy satellites that happen to be next to telecommunication satellites, etc. then it&#x27;s really naive to think they you change some laws and things won&#x27;t be happen anymore.<p>Do you really think in a country where agencies spy on the senate, where there are secret interpretations of laws by secret courts that democratic means have any chance of working?<p>Also given economical and military power how do you want to put pressure on the US? Even with some economic power the US military is still the biggest and best funded and as history has shown it&#x27;s not only there for defense.<p>I don&#x27;t think this can be changed easily, not because of thinking bad of the US (government), but because the system is big and strongly relies on these things. Big, complex systems are incredibly hard to change. The technicians here probably understand that.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It may be possible, but the chance is low and fundamental changes might even lead to unrest. That&#x27;s sad, but changing the system has been tried in many ways, even in the US, but the way the economic and military system works right now usually got strengthened or made more static. It&#x27;s maybe what you&#x27;d call a technical debt in the sense that you build up on something that&#x27;s not right.<p>You might wanna try a rewrite, but think about &quot;rewrites&quot; are in the context of a country. I am thinking about the French Revolution or &quot;tearing down&quot; of Germany after World War 2 here.<p>The US also has no history of that really being possible, because they never lost in the sense of needing to rebuild, while in Europe alone in the past 100 years everything changed completely in the couple of 100 years.<p>You can&#x27;t blame the US for not doing that. It&#x27;s not nice. Maybe a better way is possible, but so far history has no real examples of it, especially not for countries (or realms) that were so big and complex. Maybe it would even be better to do it small scale, maybe even by the states in the US declaring independence, because big realms tend to end up with one or two totalitarian systems in between and millions of death. Smaller countries or simply groups of fewer people tend to be more flexible (see startups).<p>Maybe there is another way. It would be really great if a lot of things would change, because currently  civil rights that were made in order to prevent a lot of bad things from ever happening again are by many not considered something of value anymore (even though people like to pretend otherwise, but civil rights, human rights are by definition and intention nothing that you only care for when things are good).",1415893830

The author of this article and his sources express surprise that Cisco would pay big money for an open-source product that anyone can use.<p>Cisco paid just about 10x trailing revenue for Sourcefire, a public company that had managed to dominate enterprise network security and which competed directly with products that had been cash cows for Cisco for over a decade. Cisco has for as long as I&#x27;ve been in the industry --- in fact, for as long as there&#x27;s been that industry --- been the single most important acquirer of network security companies. They acquired security companies with the same fervor in 1998 as they do today.<p>Cisco&#x27;s acquisition of Sourcefire might qualify as the single least interesting story in information security in the last 5 years.<p>Want to make a couple hundred million dollars? You too can do what Sourcefire did: start an open source project that appeals to enterprise teams who spend monopoly money to buy products (that is, start any enterprise-relevant open source project). Get thousands of people to use it. Then start a company and hire an inside sales team. Have them call company after company and ask, &quot;Do you use our open-source project?&quot; Sell extra stuff to the people who say &quot;yes&quot;.",1415893412

He was reprimanded for sounding an alarm 3 levels up without first researching a solution.<p>Third, and most importantly, his central ethics claim re: Discover is questionable.

Then Fowler came out with &quot;fluent-interfaces&quot;, and how often do you see someone make the claims that Ruby&#x27;s Array is indicative of a general badness because it has a lot of methods and you can&#x27;t memorize them all in an hour as a newbie?<p>scala.collection is the same deal.<p>:\? Sure it&#x27;s not a good idea. I wouldn&#x27;t debate that. Who uses that? foldLeft/foldRight.<p>And what&#x27;s the deal with trying to memorize the entire interface anyways? 8 or so years with Ruby, writing libraries with over 4 million downloads (<a href=""https://rubygems.org/profiles/ssmoot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rubygems.org/profiles/ssmoot</a>), and there are definitely methods in Ruby&#x27;s Array I&#x27;m unfamiliar with.<p>So what?<p>While :: and ::: look a little foreign, I don&#x27;t think asking people to learn them if they want to work with Lists in a Functional manner is anymore difficult than learning what the &quot;spaceship operator&quot; does in Ruby. And it&#x27;s optional. You don&#x27;t have to use them. But they&#x27;re usage will probably be the smaller part in the grand scheme of things. Pattern Matching and accomplishing functional recursion with immutable data is the bigger picture. Outside of that context (and the REPL I guess, for convenience) you&#x27;re just not going to see either of those operators very often (IME).<p>You don&#x27;t use a &quot;splat&quot; (aka &#x27;punched in the face&#x27;? That&#x27;s a new one to me) operator very often. It&#x27;s actually one of the few semi-pattern-matchy areas of Ruby so it comes pretty naturally for me.<p>You don&#x27;t become a pro overnight. You can trust I&#x27;d be teaching infrequently used idioms in Ruby to a developer who&#x27;d only been using it for six months. Been there, done that. ;-)<p>I guess where I&#x27;m coming from is using CBF to claim Scala is a confusing, indecipherable language. Everyone&#x27;s had that argument. I don&#x27;t know that anyone wants to stand up and claim it&#x27;s the best. But it works. Actually using it is a non-issue since you don&#x27;t actually <i>explicitly</i> use it. And look at the docs. They&#x27;re actually pretty great overall.<p>It just bothers me I suppose that someone interested in exploring Scala would be dissuaded by something that&#x27;s only ever been a problem for 1% of 1% of Scala developers.<p>If you&#x27;re just looking to swap in Play to replace Rails, odds are you&#x27;ll <i>never</i> run into any of these CBF &quot;concerns&quot;. At all. That&#x27;s the very definition of &quot;FUD&quot; IMO.<p>For every CBF in Scala there&#x27;s a Calendar in Java. Languages aren&#x27;t perfect. CBF is probably a wart. But it&#x27;s a hidden one. If you let it scare you off from Scala that&#x27;s sad, because it really has about as much to do with day to day Scala development as array.c (<a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/array.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/array.c</a>) has to do with Ruby development.",1415892361

For example, see this study of people who self-reported as having gluten sensitivity. The participants unanimously reported feeling better on the low-FODMAP run-in diet, but during the trials were found to have no specific reactions to gluten. This suggests that gluten was not actually responsible for their symptoms. One possible explanation is that a gluten-free diet may lead a person to also avoid (unintentionally) the actual cause of the symptoms (e.g. other FODMAPs that happen to be found alongside gluten in foods).<p><a href=""http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(13)00702-6/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(13)00702-6/f...</a>",1415891160

Obviously this is a pretty big coverup, but with a pending lawsuit, and obvious wrongdoing to Amazon&#x27;s 2nd biggest ad revenue generator, I&#x27;m particularly surprised more work wasn&#x27;t put into solving/covering up this issue as soon as it started blooming. I know Bezos is crazy in his desire to make Amazon the biggest giant on the block, but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius (which Bezos probably is) to realize a potentially huge problem when it happens.<p>However, the fact that this wasn&#x27;t dealt with in a better way, AND Bezos ignored emails from Kivin [0], leads me to two possible conclusions.<p>A. Bezos didn&#x27;t know the full situation, and Blackburn deceived him.<p>B. Bezos knew the full situation, but chose to side with Blackburn (I suspect Munira didn&#x27;t even cross his mind) because he values Blackburn more than morality.<p>Either of these situations show that there was a decision made by Blackburn that this could be covered up cheaper than it could be remedied--a decision I find to be Occam&#x27;s Razor here. The reason I think it was Blackburn, is I think Bezos is smart enough to just remove Kivin&#x27;s non-compete just to make it go away without even costing Bezos any of his precious little revenue.<p>I tend to evaluate companies based on how they treat their employees and if Munira and Blackburn are the typical managers and VPs at Amazon, then I think really find myself not needing Amazon&#x27;s services anymore. Let&#x27;s hope this hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else.<p>[0] &quot;I’ve sent two letters to Jeff Bezos (as these are serious issues that I believe he would care about as the founder of the company and keeper of the culture)&quot; (pg 2).",1415891070

It's difficult to give specific advice because it depends so critically on the local landscape, but in general, factor out a layer and give it a good healthy coating of unit tests, and repeat until done. It is more complicated than I make it sound, sure, but in some sense it is also really that easy. Factoring out the data access layer sounds like a first step, creating some sort of service that actually unifies the data access patterns and then moving up from there, but I can't guarantee that.<p>All but the truly worst worst scenarios are better met with this approach than a true rewrite. In this case by ""rewrite"" I mean the creation of a new system next to the existing system that doesn't work until all (or at least most) of the new pieces are in place. If you've truly got an epic snarl, rewrite may be the only option, but odds are you don't actually have <i>that</i> epic of a snarl. With the proper approaches and tons of unit tests, a refactoring is like a rewrite in the end, except you have a running system the whole time. It can actually be slightly slower in total, but you also get the value of being able to choose when to stop and a continually improving system that is always actually running; it's only slower vs. a rewrite that actually succeeds and completes and that is <i>not</i> a sure thing!<p>With a database backing you do also have the option of trying to bring up a new system that also hits the old databases, but that will in practice require the first step I laid out anyhow, the refactoring of the data access layer, and once you've done that the use of the rewrite value goes down a lot.",1295972527

While not perfect, they're the best thing we have right now to externally verify that you are who you claim to be. They provide context to the authentication.

If it's coming from an experienced engineer who doesn't want to make more work for themselves than absolutely necessary; I would take their advice in stride. If you've just hired college kids with no experience, do the opposite of what they say.<p>I currently maintain a legacy web application built over 12 years ago in C++. When it was originally built, it was that developers first programming project. It has since survived several aborted attempts to extend it with and port it to Python before landing in my lap. It's horrible to say the least.<p>However, the approach to the problem was decided before I got here. It's a smart plan and well executed by the very smart developer who worked here before me. He's wrapped the legacy application with an FFI and has written a slew of heavily tested code to sync the legacy data from the old application to a relational database that they want the new platform to be written on. From there most of the application has actually been ported to a Python web framework. Those parts that haven't are still supported by the legacy application. My job is to finish this process and then look at ""re-normalizing"" the data and start re-developing and designing the features our clients have been asking for.<p>The problem with this approach is that it's not cheap. It's not glamorous work dealing with someone else's poor design choices, bugs, and lack of documentation. It's not easy grasping the amount of complexity that goes into running a system that maintains the legacy application and the new code in parallel. A green developer simply cannot do it. People with the kind of expertise it takes to manage this approach to dealing with legacy applications come with a premium.<p>One of the first questions I asked was, ""why didn't you just rewrite this?"" They certainly had enough time. The decision to take the approach we're on now was made four years ago and was not expected to take this long. A rewrite, even a mis-estimated one, would not have taken near as long and would have been far cheaper. They also wouldn't still be suffering some of the crippling bugs that are left in the legacy code that are affecting their customers <i>to this day</i>.<p>""Rewrite,"" isn't an ugly word that should be avoided like the plague. In many cases it's a very reasonable answer to a difficult problem. Like anything you just have to evaluate the pros and cons effectively. Only experience can help you there.

2139500,comment,2139028,2139028,0,0,mjw,,,"My lessons from painful rewrites:<p>Even if you have little time to invest in refactorings along the way, at least do this: try and plan from the start to componentize wherever practical as you go along -- as soon as you start to get a decent feel for how the parts fit together, but not any sooner.<p>That means that if things do become a mess, at least you have the option to rewrite or refactor different components without having to tear down the whole edifice.<p>You'll never achieve the dream of perfect decoupling and don't die trying, but at a minimum doing what you can to break a big problem up into smaller ones will make it all a bit less scary from a psychological point of view.<p>Not going to help you if you get your component architecture wrong, either, which is why you don't do it all upfront. But do try and decouple fairly aggressively as soon as you <i>do</i> get a respectably stable insight into the structure of the problem (or of a particular part of the problem), because the longer you leave it the harder it's going to be.<p>If the structure of the problem never stabilises, <i>and</i> it's a complex problem, then good luck to you.<p>It also helps a <i>lot</i> if you start out with a framework and development tools which make it easy to be modular and easy to develop in a modular fashion. As always there's trade-offs between this and speed of development, but I suspect the suggestion of an extreme mutually exclusive trade-off, eg along the lines of ""rails vs j2ee"" is a false dichotomy. Both can (and should, and do gradually seem to be) meeting in the middle.<p>As always YMMV.",1295971250

It has to do with the fact that people <i>like</i> forming bands, making music, writing poetry, etc. They like it so much that many of them---even people who are good at it---would be willing to do it even if they didn't make any money at it. Hence, it's hard to charge a high price for labor that people are willingly oversupplying.<p>Contrast with waiting tables, where people do <i>not</i> enjoy doing it enough to do it for free. If there were a lot of people who loved it so much that they were willing to wait tables for free in their spare time, wages would probably go down there too...",1295971242

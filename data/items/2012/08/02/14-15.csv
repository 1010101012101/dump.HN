I also did a stint at HP labs in 1988 and back then I remember my mentor showing me labstock and he told me that if I needed any stuff for a side project, even outside of work, I could use what was there. However, I never witnessed anyone taking advantage of that, people were way too busy on their main projects and had other hobbies outside of work (not many PCs and no internet back then).<p>On the other hand I'm extrememly fortunate that I've always worked on projects where 80% of the time felt like working on my favorite hobby - building prototypes, coding, working with other HP sites across the globe.<p>I think if I had to look for 20% of ""fun"" time I'd surely look for a different job. I think a better strategy for large companies would be to get your employees to spend 20% on learning new stuff and I'm not talking about online classes or touchy-feely offsites.",1343919553

A lot of Germans in the south will define themselves first and foremost by their regional identity, the same is true for people from Hamburg - and the differences are striking, as most Germans from who are from one region but have lived in another will confirm.<p>That said, comparing whole nations in this manner is entertaining, yet rarely a really fruitful enterprise.

This is also shared by people generally looking down on things like drag and drop development. Obviously nothing is going to be faster than dragging the complex control someone wants to use into an HTML page and clicking deploy. The problem is that it is almost never the case that the user or your needs are met by the default setup. Then you start configuring and customizing the control.

At the basis of all of the reasoning is the inherent uncertainty of the task. Estimation is only accurate when all the details of the required task are known. For example, you can estimate how long it will take to assemble 5000 widgets if you know the average time it takes to assemble 10 widgets, and that time is consistent between executions.<p>With programming, there is no atomic unit of work that is consistent between projects, thus highly accurate estimation is next to impossible. What seems similar from a conceptual standpoint is often completely different depending upon the input factors: lanuage used, experience of the team, specific project requirements.<p>This problem has given rise to many new ways of working on programming projects. Solving this issue inside a company means building understanding of the inherent uncertainties with management and stakeholders. Solving this issue as a freelancer means inflating estimates and hoping and praying that you can keep the customer in check, because ""we can't estimate that"" just doesn't work for consultants.",1343917806

What this means is that with 1D color, you can sort all of the colors you see into a line -- dark to light.  With 2D color, you can sort all of the colors you see on a flat plane.  With 3D color, you require stacking colors.<p>Now, there's plenty of animals out there that have <i>more</i> than 3 dimensional color (they have more than 3 types of cone cells).  So two colors that look the same for a normal person will look completely different for an animal.  Some octopi have eleven dimensions of color!  To them almost every human would be severely colorblind.<p>For most people, yellow photons striking their retina will produce the same effect as a combination of red and green ones.  If you look at this cone cell response graph (<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Cones_SMJ2_E.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Cones_SMJ...</a>) you will see this is because 520 nm + 640 nm light can give the same effect as 580 nm light with the appropriate intensities.<p>Having 3 cone cells is the reason that most electronic equipment has 3 types of subpixels (red, green, and blue).  If you take the colors of these three subpixels, locate them on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram (<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/CIExy1931.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/CIExy1931...</a>) and draw a triangle to connect the points, this triangle is the color gamut of the monitor.  The more types of subpixels you add (or the further apart they are in color), the more colors your monitor can reproduce.  This is why Sharp's television with that 4th yellow pixel can reproduce more colors that humans can see.<p>It's thought that some people might be tetrachromats.  They have 4 types of cone cells because of a genetic mutation.  There's still some questions on how this extra information is processed by the brain, but there's a chance that for these people almost everyone else seems colorblind.  They are able to distinguish two colors that everyone else cannot.  This also means that television won't reproduce colors correctly for them, and it won't look natural.",1343917507

I was working closely with another team using 4, which sounded better.<p>ExtJS' main problem is that it does too much. It tries to replace jQuery, CSS, JavaScript OO frameworks and then adds it's widget/control and code structure on top of all that.<p>If it just did the last one (maybe two), it would be a decent framework. I still would not choose it because I don't like how it gets in the way of API calls nor the control of event handling in versions 2 and 3. This last point has probably been improved in 4 with the introduction of an actual MVC structure, but I don't know for certain.<p>In any case, using enormous object literals to configure and control everything from styles, events and actions made it both difficult to work with and test. Often times these blocks of code would exceed hundreds of lines. In short, ExtJS sets up developers to fail. Most of what it does can be written in jQuery using CSS classes far more concisely.

The smaller or larger the task, the more likely it is that there will be errors in the estimate. The larger a task, the more likely there is a detail that has been missed during estimation, the more chance that you will encounter a surprise during development that greatly increases development time.<p>Most successful estimation methods boil down to refusing the estimate larger tasks, and instead breaking them down into smaller tasks. The process of breaking them down forces people to think through them in more detail, and you flush out many of the surprises early on. Similarly, most of the successful systems require you to apply a minimum amount of time per task (e.g. one hour). This removes the problem of programmers underestimating simple tasks.<p>The best estimates come when you continue to use that system over several iterations of work, and analyze the accuracy of previous estimates. This gives you (and other developers) a better sense of how to make good estimates.<p>Sadly, even when you have a reliable system of predicting how much work a development team can get done in a given chunk of time, many managers bow to pressure from above to hit deadlines, and expect the team to accomplish more than the data says they are able to accomplish.",1343917303

I'm guessing the idea comes from some Agile development or Extreme Programming methodology. I'm not a fan of the latter, but Planning Poker was entertaining and seemed like it had some good points.<p>The team sits together, everyone has a deck of cards with values. The team lead calls out a task and everyone throws down his estimate at the same time. If the values diverge widely, the team lead asks the outliers to explain, and everyone can reconsider after the explanation. The highest remaining number is taken as the estimated time.<p>This was done in days for big tasks, who where then split up in sub-tasks where the same was repeated in hours.<p>Sharing the responsibility of estimates prevents the manager-pressure problem you talked about. If the team estimates it takes 5 days and the manager thinks it should only take 3, the team isn't going to back down (unlike what could happen in 1-1 conversations), and the manager will ignore the estimate at his own peril.<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/lets-play-planning-poker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/lets-play-planning-...</a>",1343916275

They have all been great to work with and have been very committed to having engineers on-site working with our engineers, carefully analyzing the data we see. We have had very rapid turnaround on any bugs we find and it has been invaluable to have people who understand the game, the renderer, the driver, and the hardware working alongside us when attacking these performance issues.""<p>Leaving aside the amazing fact that Valve is achieving higher FPS on Linux than on Windows, the great thing about efforts like this one is that we can all expect the Linux desktop to become even smoother, faster, more seamless.

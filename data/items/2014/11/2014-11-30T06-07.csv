The language and description of the paper requires a LOT of context and understanding of 1900s state of world. There are quite a few &quot;companians&quot; that can help. Here&#x27;s snippet from [1]:<p><i>Modern readers turning to Einstein’s famous 1905 paper on special relativity
may not find what they expect. Its title, “On the electrodynamics of moving bodies,”
gives no inkling that it will develop an account of space and time that will topple
Newton’s system. Even its first paragraph just calls to mind an elementary experimental
result due to Faraday concerning the interaction of a magnet and conductor. </i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion.pdf</a>",1417330764

And the majority of people think they&#x27;re in that 1-2%.<p>Meanwhile, index funds have the lovely advantage that you can&#x27;t do <i>worse</i> than the market.<p>If you have extra energy to spend investigating investments, use it to diversify into a handful of minimal-overhead index funds rather than just one.  And if you fancy yourself an investor as a hobby, take a small fraction of your savings and play with it, and congratulate yourself if you manage to do better than &quot;buy high and sell low&quot;.<p>But in general, most people would greatly improve the status of their investments by just throwing the whole thing into a halfway decent index fund.  That&#x27;s the most sensible general advice when talking to a large audience of people; get them there first, which takes far less effort, and <i>then</i> let people who really think they can do better attempt to do so.",1417330758

Sure, if you&#x27;re in the middle of Mountain View or NYC, even the tiniest apartment can be exorbitantly expensive, both in absolute terms and as a fraction of salary (which does not scale to the same degree).  Those locales are fundamentally expensive to live in unless you get very creative.  On the other hand, in most other locales, if you&#x27;re willing to live on the high end of &quot;student&quot; rather than on the high end of &quot;professional&quot;, while getting <i>paid</i> like a professional, living on a small fraction of your income is quite feasible.<p>And in any case, there&#x27;s no sense giving up on the idea completely even if you can&#x27;t hit the most aggressive savings rate; even if you only save 50% of your income, you can retire after 17 years, which puts you on track to retire in your early 40s instead of your late 60s.

It really clears up a lot of confusion on terminology regarding different forms of computing services and the challenges in the field.

It really is just computing infrastructure as a utility and the idea is nothing new. There are several other papers out there that make the same points, but I appreciate this one for really nailing the practical terminology without any sort of vagueness.

What you may want to try is looking at fictional or hypothetical scenarios which depicts people&#x27;s actions from an observer&#x27;s point of view. Then compare the same facts coming from a friend&#x27;s point of view.<p>You will be astonished at how different the two can be.<p>Nobody here is saying the YC and VC community are all evil super-villians. But as PG&#x27;s essay and your views here indicate, there may be a startlingly shallow understanding of the nuances of human behavior in the YC community as a whole.<p>Techies such as ourselves tend to be very optimistic and trusting people. We always give our friends the benefit of the doubt when we can. But you and PG are seemingly taking this way, way too far in spite of mountains of contrary evidence (and I&#x27;m talking evolutionary biology, not just anecdotal).<p>Humans are primates who form status hierarchies and ruthlessly enforce them via any means necessary. This includes power asymmetry, extortion, bribery, status signaling, and a whole host of others nasty behaviors (watch Game of Thrones for the full gamut). That PG and yourself apparently deny this basic biological fact for a certain group (i.e. YC founders) does not make it less true.<p>I have to disclaim here that I&#x27;m a huge fan of yours Paul, and I know much about the incredible struggles you&#x27;ve faced in life. I know the only way to move forward is to be relentlessly positive, and this is also my own personal philosophy. However, part of being a rational person is trying to see the empirical world for what it is, not what we want it to be. I think this is the only thing PG is guilty of; He wants founders to be above average in altruism, when the reality may be the opposite.<p>All the best, and forever a fan.",1417329943

In a liquid, public market like publicly-traded stocks though, I&#x27;m not so sure.  I don&#x27;t disagree that if you devote your life to it, you could possibly find an edge - although it will likely continue to get more difficult as institutional players become ever better at exploiting (and thus removing) any inefficiencies.  But even if we accept that it&#x27;s possible, you would almost certainly have to accept significant volatility to do so.  And even if you didn&#x27;t, you would ultimately be devoting your life to winning a zero-sum game.  (Similarly it is possible to become good enough at poker or (with more difficulty) blackjack to make a living from them.  Even a good living, potentially.  But you&#x27;re going to have to weather some downswings along the way, and you won&#x27;t have any consolation in the fact that you&#x27;re creating something of value - as you would starting a business for instance.)<p>So I guess I don&#x27;t disagree with anything you wrote, but I question whether it makes sense for a person to devote the majority of their energy to playing the stock market.  (And I <i>definitely</i> agree with you that it would indeed take the majority of one&#x27;s effort over the long term to have any reasonable chance of success beyond pure luck.)<p>Edit: I should add that I would consider some proven, passive strategies such as tilting to small and value to be exceptions.  These do theoretically allow for slightly superior returns without life-consuming effort, at the likely expense of taking on some additional dimensions of risk.  I personally keep a moderate small/value tilt.",1417329629

Redundancies are even layered - for example, there may be redundant computing modules, running redundant (and possibly independently developed software).  These computing modules may be multi-processor, have multiple banks of RAM and flash, etc ... but not used in the typical COTS way.  Instead of being devoted to increasing computing power, they are devoted to ... you guessed it, redundancy.  In highly critical hardware, you could physically remove one of the CPUs from the board while it was running, and the system would log a fault and keep on ticking without so much as a timing jitter.<p>EDIT: Also, for those of you who don&#x27;t mind working for a massive corporation instead of a startup, avionics is a fascinating niche of computing.

This is something that I’m sure you’re aware of as an early Google employee (you were invested in the company via stock options, etc). On the other hand, investing has huge downside as well (you can lose all your money).<p>Many people are advocating people to take a mindless approach to investing by investing in low-cost index funds. I personally think this is decent/good advice for most people who don’t have the time, energy, experience, skills to make investing a lifetime passion. In other words, for the typical person who just wants to focus on his 9-to-5 job and other hobbies and not deal with the world of investing, then sure low-cost index funds are the way to go.<p>However, there are some people who can benefit in huge ways by becoming experts in investing (whether this be in stocks, real estate, businesses, etc). A few disclaimers first… becoming an expert investor is extremely difficult and most people underestimate what it takes. It’s not about “picking” stocks or getting lucky. Rather, it’s about accumulating the skills, experience and expertise to evaluate investment opportunities in a wise and discerning manner, and to do it exceedingly well. I think it requires an immense amount of time and dedication. And I don’t think 98% of the people out there practically have the time, energy, motivation or focus to develop such skills. But for the 1-2%, I think it’s a possibility if they treat it as a serious lifetime endeavor.&quot;",1417328875

We are built on the principle strive to be a better person, strive to be honest and truthful and strive to the best you can be but often we do nothing of the sort. We focus on the unnecessary and not on the real. I’m not sure if its intentional that there is a perception that mean is something that needs to be there to be successful or if mean is the bilateral issue created by the humans we are and perceive to be a part of a strong leader.<p>It is not what we choose to become but who we are as a person that determines our success. Mean people do fail all the time morally and point proven they fail as founders too.  We can continue to discuss what we think is mean but really we should be discussing character. Mean people will fail at least that’s how its supposed to work from a karma standpoint sadly it doesn’t happen. But as a founder, success does depend on the person you are and the environment and culture you create. Fighting is only a force but time and acceleration you are able to go the distance even from zero. That distance you create eventually leads to momentum, which then leads to transcendence. It is changing. For us improving the world is an advantage and for us having a moral standard is advantage. At this point we have an advantage do we become the mean people or the good people. Are we building good character or bad character? To overcome adversity create ingenuity that is unbelievable.",1417328368

Cloudfront speeds up uploads to S3 in some circumstances on some networks (looking at you FIOS), because in some cases Cloudfront edge locations have direct connections to the various S3 regions instead of going over the commodity internet.  This is why Cloudfront charges 0.02 a gig for uploads.<p>Furthermore, using a CDN in this way may be a good idea because you don&#x27;t have to worry about front end server noise/internet traffic.  Cloudfront does have a good record of keeping up to date with SSL, and other various upgrades.  By using Cloudfront&#x27;s behavior rules I can have some requests go to backend servers via an ELB, others go to S3 and still others to go to other places.  The end user has no idea, the simply see the same URL that they always do.  It is nice to have everything all neatly wrapped under one URL structure and not to have to worry about DNS or cross domain antics.<p>And if I wanted to do access control I can easily use Cloudfront&#x27;s support for signed requests[1].

It&#x27;s certainly true for ketamine, as it&#x27;s being studied as a therapy for treatment resistant depression.  The results look promising but the jury is still out re: satisfying FDA approval requirements.<p>As the article says, psilocybin could have favorable effects in depression, possibly resembling results with ketamine.  Other hallucingenics are often mentioned in this regard, like LSD or mescaline.  There have been reports of utility of low dose THC for depression.<p>In discussions of potential value of any drug the pivotal issue is the risk/benefit ratio.  Hallucinogens have unmistakably caused adverse reactions.  Panic, psychosis, dissociative states have been observed often enough to warrant a high level of caution in using such drugs.<p>Part of the problem is the randomness of bad reactions.  It&#x27;s usually difficult to predict which users (or subsets of users) will endure adverse effects at a particular drug dose.  Drug interactions is another concern.

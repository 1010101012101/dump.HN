412769,comment,412443,412534,0,0,walterk,,,"> They're ugly and crap because of the extra cost.<p>Crap, maybe, but not ugly. I find it hard to believe that the complicated ugly of US cars is less costly to manufacture than the clean lines of a VW. I think it's far more likely that the people deciding who designs what and what designs make it to production have no taste.<p>Ford trends better at design than the other two. Is that because they don't suffer as much extra cost, or because they're just more competent?",1230537185

Even not counting the time it takes to drive there, at a real store you are the store's bitch, to manipulate for maximum benefit. An online store, on the other hand, is your bitch--it has to attract you right away to the things you're looking for, rather than prolong contact with those for as long as possible.",1230536392

Essentially, people would get upset that their new European bike, for which they had paid a substantial premium over an equivalent Japanese bike, would still break and require maintenance. I've owned both a KTM and a Husky (plus a Honda and a Kawasaki), and can attest to the fact that they are just pieces of machinery, like everything else. But... (and this is the bit people find hard to understand) ... the Euro bikes had something the Japanese ones didn't; something that made you forgive their mechanical woes and their extreme price.

2) They aren't 'innovating' in building a better online store / better web2.0 website; the goal is just to sell online what they're already selling in the physical store<p>I believe the right solution is to:<p>1) find some existing open source / commercial ( < $100 / month) software that handles all  this
2) throw the store online, see how profitable selling this online is
3) rewrite everything [server, credit card processing, shipment] if the commercial solution's over head (inefficiency, or transaction costs) is a big deal (i.e. when volume is high)<p>The questions are:<p>1) does the analysis for using pre-existing online software instead of rolling our own sound right?<p>2) if so, what existing solutions [open source or commercial] do you suggest<p>3) if not, why? and what should I read up on / learn?<p>Thanks!",1230535411

That means you should strive to do something beyond just byte shuffling: as someone else pointed out in another story, acquire some background knowledge - be it in physics or electrical engineering, physics, mathematics or even psychology or philosophy.<p>Or acquire deep domain specific expertise: in security, in distributed systems or in networks,  in data mining/ extraction or even in systems administration (you'd be surprised how hard it is to find excellent coders who are also good sysadmins and/or excellent sysadmins who are also good coders and how many jobs demand both).<p>My mother is in her sixties, isn't a native English speaker and programs in C (which some may look upon as ""outdated"" compared to C++ and Java), Scheme and OCaml (which aren't mainstream languages).

In the case of a bankruptcy, the courts would have  trashed those idiotic work contracts and brought in something more in line with their competitors. Bankruptcy would have also gotten rid of the dealer safeguards the are currently preventing the 3 from downsizing (shutting down a dealership usually means that said dealership needs to be bought out -- very expensive but the fact that GM has been doing this for the last several years shows how desperate they are to downsize their US operation).<p>With the bailout, all that pressure is gone. The only real way GM et al. have a way of pressuring the UAW now is to convince the UAW that they are willing to go out of business to turn a profit... no longer a credible threat because the next congress will happily bail out the UAW for the chance to waste more money on ""green cars"" (Ie. overpriced cars that nobody wants).<p>Toyota and the other foreign manufacturers were careful never to become too dependent on unions and they are also not subject to the two fleet requirements (too much, they are careful to skirt them) of the CAFE regulations thus giving them a credible bargaining chip against unions like the UAW when negotiations are necessary.

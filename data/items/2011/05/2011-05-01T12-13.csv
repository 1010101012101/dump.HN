Take for instance plebgui.patspam.com, a demo PlebGUI site site running in FastCGI mode on HostMonster (the prototypical low-cost shared webhost).<p>---------<p>Even though, the application did have even better performance via Starman but it is more a server matter than a PSGI related matter.<p>>fastpass [...] is XS dependency free (unlike FCGI.pm and CGI::Fast) and the performance is still the same with FCGI.pm, roughly like 4000 requests per second on my laptop, with a simple HelloWorld app via an nginx frontend. I guess we could do even better by doing optional XS parsing with pure perl fallback as well.<p>THIS is interesting.",1304254519

If you want your language to be compiled (ahead of time or JIT), I would recommend LLVM.<p>In any case, I'd be interested in hearing about your experiences, so perhaps you should write a blog post or something when you get it working.",1304252592

The ambiance on the whole premises is the same as school : careless playful youth (even coming from the senior engineers), toys everywhere, and the implicit deal that Google will give you everything if you give it everything.  I felt a perverse temptation to give in to this, although i knew very well this attitude generates a dependence relation in the employee.<p>After working in the austere world of avionics for over 10 years, i found it absolutely shocking.

2502932,comment,2502663,2502803,15,0,nonrecursive,,,"Hi, I made the site. Your criticism and the other points in this thread are valuable to me - so thanks.<p>When writing the site, I showed the before & after to a few non-designers, and every single one had the impression that the right-hand flyer looked better. In my opinion, that's key - if something _looks_ more understandable, it's more likely to be read. If something _looks_ hard to digest, people aren't even going to bother.<p>The readability may look like an issue on the site, but when the flyers were actually printed, the apparent problem no longer actually looked like a problem.<p>@Jabbles - yes, the font differences were a large difference that I don't mention anywhere. Using a sans-serif font for the headers and a serif font for the text creates more contrast, making the headers stand out more and making the headers and details more easily distinguishable from each other.<p>A number of the points made are excellent ones, and I wish I had incorporated them. For example, the contact information should have been way, way more prominent. Capitalizing the URL is something I've never considered in the three years since I made the flyer, but I can see how that would help.<p>Thanks again for all your criticisms. I've never created a site like this before, and man, was it difficult for me. I spent at least 200 hours on it, going over the text and examples over and over again. There's much, much more I'd like to do with it, and there are many flaws I want to address, but for now I feel like it's more important that it's just out there.",1304252014

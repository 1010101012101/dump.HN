3389160,comment,3387543,3387702,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"I can't determine just where in the resulting sub-threads to repy, so I'm just replying to myself.<p>Scope of, um, ""boycott"":  I have lots of material at hand that I've already purchased.  That can provide many hours of interest/entertainment.  My purpose is not to ""empty my life"" of such things; it is to reduce the immediate cash flow of these companies.  I'll read the book I've already purchased, or rewatch the DVD I liked enough to buy in the first place.  Or... go to the library.<p>Libraries have been receiving somewhat short shrift in the last decade (in the U.S.), although I've read of an uptick in patronage since the economic crisis hit.  I support the library model, and I'm not opposed to some purchases being made by libraries who then share the work in a socially and legally codified manner.  Libraries have mostly ""been on our side"", and the side-effect of my boycott lending support to my local libraries would be a welcome one, to me.<p>""Honest"" publishers.  I also don't want to lump ""everone"" into the same boat.  I've long been a pretty good patron of O'Reilly Publishing, and I have some works from Manning, Pragmatic Programmers, etc. lying around.  All these companies sell me quality works (well, if I pick well) and are willing to give me digital formats free of DRM.  Tim's been more than fair in allowing me to ""upgrade"" my existing printed books to digital format.  Such fairness I reciprocate by continuing to support their businesses.<p>My relationship with media:  Actually, this is where I become a bit... ""rhetorical"", if not disingenuous.  I don't actually purchase that much, myself.  My cable tv service level is basic, because the pricing works out the same as it would be with Internet-alone and because broadcast reception was poor and vanished altogether when the roof was replaced.  Yes, I'm stuck with a cable company for my Internet.  Like much of the country, I don't really have a choice.  The one competitor -- if they've finally fixed their ""last mile"" problem to my particular location -- is a major telco whose policies and behavior if anything are actually worse.  So, I'm screwed, on this point, as I can't do without the connection.<p>I don't purchase much music.  I mostly listen to what I have.<p>DVD's, I also only purchase a handful every few years.<p>My one other consistent source of active spending is Netflix.  I feel for them, being stuck between the entertainment industry, the cable companies and telco's, and viewers -- their users.  Their position reminds me in the abstract of the recurrent admonition:  ""Don't be a share-cropper.""  However... those dollars are flowing to the entertainment industry.  In the form of Netflix subscriber levels and revenue, they represent a distinct and readily -- frequently -- measured metric.  And Netflix recent bumblings have chilled me somewhat in my support -- in part, regardless of how much I like them, I've come to perceive just how badly, fundamentally, their model is broken when viewed in the current context.<p>So... do I drop to a minimum level, or pull the plug altogether?  They maintain one's existing queue's for 18 months, so I wouldn't have to reconstruct those -- and they are also save-able as a simple web page.  They make it pretty easy to leave -- to their credit.<p>I guess a primary concern about my relationship to media is that I find myself too often settling for the crappy distraction of the basic cable service, because it's there and is immediate.  I don't discover some interesting new music because I'm not purchasing the latest equipment and streaming and giving Jobs, now Cook, his pound of flesh, etc.<p>As it is, I let too much crap into my life.  And yes, Mz, I know the situation of seeking, needing simple, mindless distraction from discomfort.<p>Here's the thing, though.  That movie, that song, is still available next year.  Still new -- with that initial joy of discovery -- to me.  And sometimes, the slight remove means I can skip the crap and let the cream filter to the top before I partake.<p>It's hard to be social, I guess, when you're disconnected.  And part of being young is to be social, if not more actively so nonetheless in a different, more novel mode engendering new contacts and relationships.<p>But the current situation -- SOPA et al. -- threatens a lot of that novelty.  The coolest stuff mostly doesn't come from the maw of Disney -- not once you're old enough to make your own purchases.  And we're not talking forever.  We're talking some weeks or months.  Which could be novel in itself.<p>Don't purchase that album or DVD.  Go see a local band.  Check out the theater.  I'm fortunate in that where I live, there's tons of it at reasonable price being put on by people of every generation.<p>I apologize for placing such an early morning hazed ramble on HN.  But, at a first pass, there's my response.  Make it about choice, and quality.  Make it novel and something to do.  Turn the ""absence"" into a positive, or several positives.  And take a swing at the knees of these bastards who want to spend us into their suck.",1324745574
3389159,comment,3388645,3388760,1,0,wisty,,,"Well, it is dishonest to conflagrate the two issues - organ harvesting and the Uighur situation.<p>Harvesting organs from condemned criminals is kind of messed up, but you can see why they do it. China has a big shortage of organ donors. It's fucked up if they are doing it in an inhumane way, but it has little to do with the Uighurs - most of the ""donors"" will be Han (though Uighurs will be disproportionately represented for a few reasons).<p>The Uighur situation is also complicated. If China didn't invade, Xinjiang would probably be some basket-case like Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan (both have a GDP per capita of about $850 / year). China has a GDP per capita of over $4,000, though Uighurs may be below average. On the other hand, the China hasn't always been a barrel of laughs. I'm not sure there was ever an ""intent to destroy"", which is part of the definition of genocide, but you wouldn't call the accusation ""bullshit"", either.<p>I don't like the way the two issues are being packaged together, though.",1324745535
3389158,comment,3387628,3387628,5,0,MBCook,,,"Unfortunately this doesn't surprise me too much. I'm a Mac user and eagerly awaited the Mac release, only to find it had terrible performance and game breakage bugs. I emailed the developers and received two replies.<p>Tommy, the developer quoted here, started his email implying my complaint was faked, then saying they couldn't reproduce the issue of the game crashing every time you entered a warp zone, although they said they were working on it. His response made me quite a bit madder.<p>Edmund, the other developer, replied separately. He was apologetic and mentioned that the person they had originally paid to port the game fell through so it had to be done very fast. This was the kind of email I was expecting. It wasn't confrontational at all.<p>They later released a patch that fixed the crashing issues, but performance is still a major problem. The Windows system requirements are listed as a 1.4 GHz P4 with 768 MB of RAM. On the official blog, they list a dual core 2.6 GHz machine with 2 GB of RAM as the minimum requirements for the Mac. The game is officially supposed to support the 360 gamepad, but a note was left on the Steam forum that despite the promise it's not possible to support it correctly on the Mac, so the problem won't be fixed.<p>I thought the binding of Isaac looked interesting, and it has been getting good reviews. But after my experience I'm not going to play it. Super Meat Boy was a lot of fun (even though it didn't perform well on my Mac), but after my experience seeing the response to this issue doesn't surprise me.",1324745510

I had zero Java experience, but I felt inspired by your post, so I searched ""java without ide"" and got an XML parser up and running in approximately 20 minutes.<p>For the curious reader, here's how to do Java entirely from the command line:<p>1) install the JDK and add its ""bin"" directory to your PATH.  For me this was ""jdk1.7.0_02/bin""<p>2) copy and paste <a href=""http://pastebin.com/R47bwDZx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/R47bwDZx</a> and save it into a new file called ""test.xml""<p>3) copy and paste <a href=""http://pastebin.com/Ut5dKBkn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/Ut5dKBkn</a> and save it into a new file called ""ReadXMLFile.java""<p>- note, this is not my code.

Production code would be cleaner than this.<p>4) run these commands:<p><pre><code>  javac ReadXMLFile.java
  java ReadXMLFile test.xml
</code></pre>
And the XML file is parsed!<p>So why go through all this trouble, when you could just write it in Python?<p>Deployment comes to mind as one reason to go with this approach; fewer systems have Python installed than Java runtime.<p>So therefore when you deploy your app, you'd have to either 1) make customers install Python, or 2) (more likely) ship the contents of the ""Python27"" folder along with your Python app, and invoke your app via a shell script, or something.

(and C++'s type system? not really going for the stars, are you?) Because a major part of Python and Ruby is indeed that they're <i>not</i> statically typed. A nominative static type system would yield quite different a language, probably something close to Cython[0]. Alternatively, you could fork Python or Ruby with a structural type system, this could be interesting but still  I think  different languages than their originators, not merely dialects.

I've actually been tinkering with a pair system in my own Forth dialect that could be interesting if you've ever wondered what recursive list operations would look like in a concatenative language.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Programming-Personal-Expert-Systems/dp/0830626921/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Programming-Personal-Expert-...</a>

There's not nearly enough information to suggest anything at the moment.<p>I'm trying hard to avoid Politics and partisan side-choosing.<p>Giving small amounts of funding to all politicians is better than picking a side and giving large amounts to that side; it helps even out spending wins.  Funding pro-SOPA politicians at least gives you an edge when you talk to them: ""We hate SOPA, we like you, we even gave you some cash,but this SOPA thing is awful.

The laws and the legal system in India are ill-equipped and not adequately trained to understand the nuances of the digital world. I had a first-hand experience of this a few years ago at my last job when we were dragged into an investigation that was looking into defamatory comments posted against a particular individual.<p>We had to work with the cyber crime cell to help them find what they were looking for and found the officers to be well-meaning and nice people. The only downside was the training given to them, which was next to non-existent. We eventually wound up helping them out a lot and also worked with them to help them get a better understanding of the issue at hand. I actually felt quite bad for them. The office we went to had a handful of ancient PCs of which only one was connected to the internet - a far cry from anything that you'd expect.<p>The same thing applies to courts, judgements are often handed out without a good understanding of the digital world. A judge when shown awful content will almost every time order its removal, there is hardly anything surprising about it.<p>This certainly won't be the last word on this, but we have a long road ahead increasing awareness and training of both the legal system and enforcement. By the time we finally get there, there will be a lot of mistakes arising from totally unintended consequences, but I am confident that we'll eventually get it right.",1324743972

Let's run through the general structure.<p>Only a fraction of the Chinese executions result in organ donations; some will fail, of course, and only a fraction of those donations result in the equivalent of a life, 30 years at the most optimistic the article says. Given the ages involved (younger men being executed for their organs' use in older men), we can expect each execution to save significantly less than one life on a lifespan/QALY basis.<p>The value of each execution would not be significantly better in the US and the same logic applies.<p>Wikipedia lists rates of Chinese execution at 5000-10000 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Peop...</a>) a year during the 2000s; the estimate is difficult as it is a state secret. It is not in the US, so we have more solid numbers in the 30-50 range for the 2000s (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Unite...</a>).<p>Keeping in mind the previous logic, this indicates the number of lives saved by organ donations from all US executions would be under 30-50.<p>Now, let's compare that with the Chinese system. At 5000 executions a year, the profit and other perverse incentives in place would need to result in only 1% of prisoners being unjustly executed for the benefits of American organ donation to be <i>completely</i> eliminated.<p>And actually, remembering the point about QALYs, for every person unjustly executed for their organs, they represent a net decrease in welfare. We all know how many the US incorrectly executes, and that's <i>with</i> the state benefitting not at all from the execution and wasting a tremendous amount of money going through appeals and a strong civil society and many groups opposed to execution like the Innocence Project.<p>There is no reason to think China does not have a significantly worse false execution rate even before we add in the perverse incentives of organ harvesting.",1324742957

340956,story,,,1,1,Raphael,"User-generated content and meta programming",,"I was metaphorically throwing a ball against a wall today, thinking about how tedious it is to come up with all the items and characters in an RPG. So, I want to make system where people can create items to appear in games. As far as I'm concerned, an item is primarily a list of stats, although it should probably have a graphical representation and a description.<p>The items have to conform to specifications on which stats they have and what range of values a stat can have. For example, a sword must have an attack value between 0 and 99. The items may combine in ceratain ways to create more powerful items. The more I thought about it, the more parallels I could draw to object-oriented programming. People are essentially writing classes for game items.<p>I am interested in implementing at least a demo of this system. Sure, I could slog through it step by step, but it seems that I'd be rewriting major parts of the language. Could there be a way to avoid this?",1224741514

It is not merely about the number it is about the people who would control the system. I agree the divide based on caste is gradually lowering however we are still not there yet.<p>It is a fact that all of these research institutes are concentrated in the south - IISc, ISRO, DRDO (and the rest in CV RamanNagar, Bangalore) and casteism has always been the problem here.<p>NASA has a large number of Indians. I am sure Indian Research would be in a lot better state if they evangelize and hire more youngsters.<p>We definitely have a smart bunch of people in pure sciences than in business. Why do you think we cannot retain them here in India ?",1224741429

I know Obama's leading by a margin... but 95/2/3 (Dem,Rep,Ind)?<p>It's a neat idea with a nice implementation, but the selection bias that's going on make the polling outcome very nearly meaningless.",1224741173

It is not exactly easy to use email today, people come up with a lot a solutions on their own to be more effective. Email programs will be doing most of the work that was traditionally done by humans which not only is waste of our time but also requires quite a lot of discipline.",1224738057

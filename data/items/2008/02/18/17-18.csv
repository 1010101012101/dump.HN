118229,comment,117727,117978,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I must admit finding it hard to make the distinction you suggest.<p>Would the American Civil War be a big guy beating up on a little guy? After all, the North was ten times as populous, and many, many times as rich. Nobody on either side thought the war would last very long.<p>How about the Romans and the Germanic tribes? Nobody in their right mind thought those Barbarians could stand up against the full might of the Roman Empire very long.<p>Wars are fought until one side decides to stop fighting. This means that ""big guy/little guy"" wars and ""outcome is uncertain"" wars don't seem to be that different. In fact the determining factor would seem to be how easy it is for one side to quit. But how would you know how much it would take to make the other side stop fighting until it actually happens? From the history I've seen, when both sides are very intimate with each other's language and culture -- that's when some of the deadliest, nastiest conflicts take place.",1203357258

In my opinion, you should use a na√Øve approach (within limits, recursive Fibonnaci definitions are exempt) until it becomes necessary to do things more efficiently. Of course this entails always keeping in mind who your users are and whether a certain design choice needs to remain in your code for a long time, something it seems this installer team didn't quite grasp.<p>But always choosing the most efficient algorithm leads to a program where code that runs for two milliseconds every minute runs 10 times faster for 3 times your development effort, with 3 bugs introduced in the process because you weren't paying attention.<p><pre><code>  How much time is wasted? On my machine summing a billion bytes row-wise takes 9 seconds, whereas \n  summing them column-wise takes 51 seconds. The less sequential your data acccess, the slower\n  your program will run.\n</code></pre>\nYes, if you sum gigabyte-sized arrays all the time, this is definitely something you should worry about. But not all problems require this kind of attention to low-level details. Most of the time you are searching an 8-byte array, in which case the choice of binary search vs. linear search is irrelevant.<p>Of course it pays to be aware of these things (you won't have to go hunting in the library when you hit a wall) but <i>keeping them in mind</i> at all times is more trouble than it's worth. There are more important things to worry about, for instance whether your unit tests cover every likely case.",1203355308

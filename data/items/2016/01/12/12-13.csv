In my opinion, pluses:<p>+ Compiler with very helpful error messages;<p>+ Cargo is the best package manager in the universe;<p>+ Result<> is the most correct way to return results from function, I dreamed about it;<p>+ Community of smart and friendly people.<p>Minuses:<p>- Functions are not first class citizens - you can&#x27;t return function as result;<p>- Violation of &quot;explicit over implicit&quot; rule in methods declarations: argument self/&self is implicitly omitted in call, but exist in signature. Because of this, for example, you can&#x27;t use method of class as request handler in Iron, you need closure wrapper with same order and count of arguments. Pure ugliness;<p>- Often you need just add lifetime definition to satisfy compiler, without doing anything with this lifetime anywhere else in code;<p>- Extremely verbose syntax;<p>- Rust has exceptions (panic), and you can&#x27;t catch them. And with promised panic::recover you&#x27;ll have limitations of supported structures;<p>- Errors handling encourages copy-pasting;<p>- Syntax is not intuitive, especially when traits and lifetimes comes into declaration - in such cases you can look at own code and think &quot;I hope at least compiler can read it&quot;;<p>- Nested structures is pain;<p>- Lack of optional and named arguments, lack of predefined values in structures;<p>- Too few modules for web. Just 1 module for MySQL (thanks to it&#x27;s author - actively maintained);<p>- Usage of safe code can lead to out-of-bounds errors, with thread panic (hello to vec macros).<p>And I still think it&#x27;s best language we have:) Biggest advantage - most of errors can be found on compilation step.

Coming from C# I never even thought about the difference between storing a concrete type in an array vs storing an abstract type or interface in an array. In C# so long as they are reference types, there is very little difference. Each entry would be a pointer to the heap regardless. Moving to a language that encourages stack allocation and structs on the stack instead of on the heap, and actually has you motivate each pointer is a huge difference.<p>The same goes for ownership: it&#x27;s very easy to forget it with a GC&#x27;d runtime (this is just sloppy, but the GC will unfortunately help you be sloppy). Way too often the code you write in a GC&#x27;d language will have convenient pointers both up, down and sideways in any data structure, just in case.

It grows by a process of cell division. Each division turns one cell into two adjacent cells. The structure it ends up with will depend on the orientation of those dividing cells (you&#x27;ll tend to get growth &quot;along the axis of division&quot;, so to speak).<p>A wide variety of multicellular organisms have a mechanism that orients cells according to features on the outside of neighbouring cells. (It &quot;mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues&quot;, as the abstract puts it. The &quot;mitotic spindle&quot; is a structure involved in cell division, also called mitosis. It&#x27;s mostly made out of long thin things called microtubules, and its job is to separate the chromosomes for the two new cells, which it does using &quot;motor proteins&quot;. The cell cortex is the inner surface of the boundary of the cell.)<p>One part of this process is the way in which a protein involved in the mitotic spindle attaches itself to that thing on the cell cortex. The relevant bit of that protein is called the &quot;guanylate kinase protein interaction domain&quot; or GK_PID for short. A protein interaction domain is a bit of protein that interacts with other things; multiple different proteins can contain instances of the same interaction domain, just as multiple different programs can contain (say) the same code for computing SHA-256 checksums.<p>The paper reports evidence that a single mutation enabled the GK_PID to attach itself to the marker on the cell cortex. (&quot;The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which – the evolution of GK_PID’s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein – can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GK_PID.&quot;<p>So. This doesn&#x27;t say that multicellularity was enabled by a single mutation. It says that one small but important part of a process that&#x27;s necessary for complex multicellular organisms was enabled by a single mutation.

Let&#x27;s also ignore the issue of personal freedom vs. the hours mandated by your employer. Let&#x27;s focus only on maximizing the total output you can generate. As I understand, this is your case.<p>The metric productivity-per-hour is stupid. It&#x27;s useless trying to optimize it - just like you said. The natural cycle for humans is a day. The body requires rest and is tuned to have an optimal performance if the do/rest cycles are loosely synced with the day/night cycles of the sun. You need to optimize that cycle, in the long run, to maximize your total output.<p>&quot;... when you come back the following day your productivity per hour is significantly impaired, do you open up the possibility of actually reducing your net output.&quot;<p>Yes, I do. The burnout today at work has an effect on your productivity tomorrow. In attempt to get a little extra done today, tomorrow you won&#x27;t be that efficient at your peak, and you&#x27;ll be more tired and unproductive at the and of the day, compared to the previous. This way your average productivity per day, from both days, can easily be lower than if you had worked 3 hours less the first night and the second day were just as efficient and productive as the first.<p>This effect extends in a long run. Fatigue accumulation and sleep debt are real phenomenons. Poorly managed day-to-day cycles can render people incapable of doing any meaningful work. The remedy is rest/vacation, which kills your averages even more.<p>You should know, even better than me, that working people don&#x27;t only produce output. They are learning too. The work that you&#x27;ll be required to do in a year or two is not the same as the one you do today. Mental fatigue impairs learning new stuff a lot more than it impairs <i>doing</i> stuff you already know.",1452601565

Also, if your leaf component style files change rapidly, you&#x27;ll invalidate the hashes on large bundles pretty frequently.<p>For this reason, I think a better solution might be to inject critical styles into a STYLE tag in the HEAD, and then deliver one style file per component. The intuition behind this is that you can do your initial render with only the original payload (ideally in the first roundtrip), and that will buy you plenty of time for the cascade of web requests to get all the individual component files. With HTTP/2 multiplexing coming, there&#x27;s no much penalty there. And then you get to cache your page at the granularity of a single component.",1452600786

3182320,comment,3181629,3182098,10,0,gizmo,,,"I agree with the statistics (racism is real; white people are less like to be discriminated against or experience indirect racism) but draw the opposite conclusion.<p>When dealing with issues of discrimination the point is to treat everybody equally, to treat people based on their merits and not based on the color of their skin or the statistics of their demographic. If we conclude from research that one race is more intelligent than another, or taller than another, or has more aptitude in some domain, then a rational agent would reason: ""well, this person is from domain D, and people from domain D have less aptitude in Y, and since I am hiring people for that aptitude, I am less inclined to hire this person."". Logically sound, but still discriminatory. It's discriminatory because the person is treated based on the demographic he belongs to, not on his or her individual merits. So even if the research points out that one demographic is inferior to another demographic on one axis that still doesn't justify treating an <i>individual</i> based on his membership of a demographic. To put it bluntly, if research shows (it doesn't) that white people are absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt better at programming than black people discrimination against black people <i>would still be wrong</i>. The differences in aptitude between the individuals always trump differences in aptitude between large groups.<p>So when you say ""a person's race is entirely relevant"", I think you're completely and terribly wrong. Because it's <i>irrelevant</i> whether a typical white person understands less about racism than a typical black person. What matters is whether the specific individual understands. Again, the individual is not to be judged based on his membership of a demographic.<p>Yes, a typical white person understands less about racism than a typical black person. And a majority of the prison population consists of black people. And if you apply those generic traits of the demographic to the individual you're racist. When you judge a black person on his statistical likelihood of having a criminal record then that's racist. When you judge a white person on his statistical likelihood of ignorance on race issues that's also racist.",1320159456

I can (and do) use R for most of my analyses, but there's a cost in transparency -- I can't realistically ask someone to review my R code when they don't know the language, and the bus factor is high if anything I write in R is at all important.<p>That's why I'm trying to use Ruby where possible, even at the cost of a small productivity hit. The benefits of others being able to read my code far outweigh the few extra minutes it takes for me to do something (and in many cases, the sheer brevity of Ruby as a language means it's faster, simply because it's less typing).<p>I'd love to see SciRuby become a more useful project, and I'd love to contribute. Unfortunately, they don't make it especially easy to get involved -- the mailing list points people to the roadmap, but it's not at the level of detail where someone could jump in (and the component gems don't seem much better), so it's a bit hard to know where help would actually be useful.",1320159330

The costs of running a successful, political campaign are unbelievably high and contributions from corporations and lobby organizations play a major role in it.
For all practical purposes, you only get the choice between two huge parties. Not only is a large segment of the population pretty much bound to one party, since they would never ever vote for the other party, but for those people who actually might swing their vote, there are even more issues at hand. 
Even if you wanted to use corruption as your single decision criterium, the choice would be hard. Both parties managed to stay pretty en par in that and that's all they needed to do.
The brain washing that the campaign contributions pay for also work really well. It's astonishing what unimportant tiny events change in the polls before a presidential election. There is a complete decoupling from reality, once the race nears the finish.<p>If we want a better working system, we need a better democratic process. Sadly the US was a pioneer in that and is still stuck with a system, that was brilliant for its time, but needs updating. We need a system that allows more than two parties to participate and we need better campaign funding regulation.<p>That's the only way we can permanently stop BS like this",1320158868

The reason is actually very simple (as others have commented): <i>African-Americans are underrepresented in CS, EE, and other tech fields</i>. This is similar to the issue of the dearth of women in these fields. Now, the reasons for this are complex and are not easy to solve. So, instead, while waiting for the root causes and biases to go away, be pragmatic and solve the problem at hand.<p>The solution is easy, but is not affirmative action or specialized VCs or quotas: It's as simple as increasing the demand of black (or women) programmers.<p>How to do this? I am working as a software mentor for two FIRST Robotics Teams in Chicago South Side, these teams are almost all black and this is their first exposure to programming (unfortunately, we have to use C++ for first exposure!) So, I alone have the power to introduce 5-10 black programmers to tech community! Assume I have 20% success, which is really lousy, that means 1-2 programmers. If 1K people do this, that's 1K more black programmers on the market.<p>Another example: Finding that the teams on the Apps for Metro Chicago challenge were all-male, my friend Pallavi quickly assembled an all-female team of college students, who won the second prize (<a href=""http://www.metroplanning.org/news-events/blog-post/6262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metroplanning.org/news-events/blog-post/6262</a>) and were featured in the local press.<p>So, same as starting a company: you don't need anybody's permission to start helping kids to solve this problem.",1320158805

I worked with several Indian co-workers and it wasn't unusual to have calls transferred to me (no accent) because people didn't want to talk to them. As a team lead I got to listen in to those calls, and it's amazing how badly one human being can treat another. There's the passive aggressive person who just keeps saying ""i don't understand you"". There's the person who says things like ""Where am I talking to"" ""are you in india?"" ""Can I speak to someone from Canada"" (we were all in Canada, same country as the callers). Then there's the people who would just rip in to the agent, questioning their intelligence, yelling at them and much more.<p>On the other hand, we would often have people call in who had strong accents, and the tech support agents would often judge the callers as 'dumb'. I earned a reputation of being a genius, not because I was a genius but because I'd actually listen to people and try to understand them (sometimes they were hard to understand) rather than being an asshole to them.<p>In short - it was very common for people on both ends of the phone to rationalize racisim with a hard to understand accent.",1320158440

Yes, everything works until it doesn't, and nothing works until it does. Evaluative statements of the past don't always predict the future.<p>I agree that it won't be easy.

Lazy programmers produce crappy applications. But there are a large number of motivated developers out there as well. They've seen what a touch UI should look like.

And partnering with the electronics industry rather than competing as a manufacturer has - with the exception of the XBOX in a market dominated by proprietary hardware - been a highly successful course.<p>Finally, it is not as if the design decisions underlying the courier are dead - a viable dual screen tablet is still as plausible today as it was when the iPad started shipping and there is no reason such a device could not run with a Metro interface or that the technology developed as part of the Courier project could not be incorporated.<p>What was killed was a project which required forking the Windows roadmap in ways analogous to past Microsoft decisions and  which led to Windows Mobile becoming a dead end overnight - never mind that a mobile device without email probably would have been stillborn.",1320157572

One might argue that is a natural extension of what's already there, though - <i>content</i> by trusted authors already has a higher chance of making it to the front page. In any case, it's why I think it would be important to preserve the ability to look at the unfiltered front page.<p>Another consideration is privacy. The 'b' scheme is meant to have less of an effect on the content users get to see by keeping the list of items on the front page the same for everyone, but it gives up the votes of others in a very direct way. The 'a' scheme might avoid that, at least if changing your weighting preferences were rate-limited (i.e. if you can only change weights once per day, then the regular movement on the front page would make it fairly hard to deduce votes by comparing to the unfiltered page).<p>What do you think? Would you like to have the ability to weight users' votes? Would you exercise it? Would it affect the HN formula positively or negatively in your eyes?",1320157294

You can POKE bytes into the virtual memory, and they come out as voxels. I don't compromise on this -- even the menus are drawn into the voxel display. Hopefully one day I can get hold of a real physical 128x128x64 display and play Voxatron on it with almost no modification.""</i><p>The game is a top-down shooter in the vein of Robotron, but with 3D environments.

I have an undergraduate degree in engineering (partially because I wanted to rebel against my parent's wishes for me to do CS). Software cannot be engineered like a bridge. Structural engineering is very narrowly scoped. You have a design load, comprised of live loads like wind and moving cars and static loads from the weight of the structure itself. There are entire ""cookbooks"" of formulas used to compute the theoretical, accepted thickness of the support beams and bolts. There is standardized everything, from the project management terminology to the thread count on the bolts. After graduating, if you gain four years (in some states, less) of practical engineering experience, you can take the Professional Engineer (PE) exam. In some cases, to prove your experience, you need to submit three inches thick of paper calculations you have done while working. The PE exam is rigorous and graded on a curve. But once you pass, you get the pride and responsibility of having a seal that you can use to emboss blueprints. That says you take responsibility for the work. Software development is not engineering, and I have strong philosophical discussions with those programmers who insist on that term.<p>Software development is creative problem solving.

What looks cool in a demo doesn't always translate to practice. There are a lot of uneasy questions here:<p>* How big is the market for a content creation tablet in Allard's vision?<p>* Is it safe to assume that architects, artists, etc would use such a device for their core work, or would it simply be a ""for fun"" device? ""For fun"" devices that sell at high price points are a big risk in my view.<p>* With Allard bucking the notion that the product needed to align with Microsoft's core software line-up, how wise would it be to bet the future (post-PC world, yada yada) on a product that diverges from the company line, rather than converges?<p>If Microsoft did anything with the Courier tablet, they should position it within their entertainment division along with the XBox. The issue with that is that they'd essentially be cultivating competing businesses within Microsoft. XBox + Courier becomes the ""post-PC"" business unit, while the Windows cash cow is forced to compete. I'm not sure that makes sense either.<p>There is not an easy play here. I think Metro is a huge step forward for Microsoft, and they're making some interesting plays with regards to traditional Windows integration. It certainly looks a lot like what people have been screaming for: a tablet that can run a post-PC operating system, but can switch back to their tried and true Windows desktop when needed.

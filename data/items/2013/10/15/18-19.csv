6555545,comment,6550651,6552012,1,0,lifeformed,,,"Hmm.  I&#x27;ve never read about constructive logic, it looks pretty interesting.  Thanks for bringing it up, I&#x27;ll look into it.<p>Maybe those two examples I gave are bad.  But in general, I guess that the question itself (of whether or not logic holds true in all universes) sounds like it is fundamentally unanswerable by using our logical system.  Since the fundamentals are axioms, and presupposing an axiom to be false would always be contradictory, we could never prove such a universe to exist.<p>What even is logic?  The more I think about it, the less fundamental it seems, and the more it seems like just an aspect of our brains.  It&#x27;s like they are just descriptions of the internal consistency in how our brains are wired.  What does it even mean for something to be true or false?  Reality is just reality, and any &quot;sense&quot; we make of it is just a state of equilibrium in our brains.<p>Is a mathematical statement in our minds (like 1+1=2) true because of the nature of reality, or true because the structure and rules of arithmetic that we&#x27;ve created happen to trigger some pleasurable sense of consistency in our minds?  And perhaps the whole derivation of mathematics is just a discovery of how our brains perceive &quot;correctness&quot;.<p>Well, I&#x27;m rambling, I guess it&#x27;s an unknowable thing, because we&#x27;re always operating in the bias of our own minds.",1381863582

6555529,comment,6553155,6553155,1,0,Charos,,,"Freedom in learning is so, so important. This case study illuminates that pretty well. It&#x27;s a great look into an example of allowing children to truly learn at their own pace, with gentle guidance regarding subject areas and provided with the resources they need to discover new knowledge. The story is heartwarming and a great read, and a useful comparison to the modern American style of education.<p>As others have pointed out, there is no magic bullet. This method would work incredibly well for 90% of subjects taught in elementary school. However, for non-English language learning, additional guidance would be needed - the teachers could nudge them towards Duolingo, various online multilingual dictionaries, etc. I do believe that this system could be used as the core of a new teaching paradigm, but it is not solely sufficient for a complete learning experience to the standards that we have come to expect in America.<p>For developing countries (which, sadly, Mexico bears much resemblance to), this could be an incredible tool. An internet-connected computer and guidance from involved teachers can easily produce students who are ready to help lift their countries out of economic malaise. In this way, I believe the internet can serve as the Great Equalizer many of us hoped it would someday become. If this method used alone is capable of producing students 70% as capable (by some nonexistent perfect metric) as those in first-world nations, that would still be an enormous leap forward for developing nations. I think these guys are really on to something in this regard.<p>I find it interesting that as our civilizations mature, we find ourselves oscillating back away from the industrialized American education system paradigms and towards a more holistic, broadly-focused educational strategy using qualitative methods rather than quantitative objectives. Students are not a homogeneous population, and historically we have tried to deal with this issue by ignoring it and cramming them all into the same mold, with minor variations. It makes me glad to see that we are starting to consider that we should instead allow for this variance by designing systems with broader definitions and qualitative goals, to allow the students to grow in the directions they are best suited or disposed to.",1381863472

I don&#x27;t miss a single soul and I feel really good again, more energetic and enthusiastic even. I just realized I really only do have about 5 people I should keep in contact with. Everyone else was a relationship that was kept up just from virtue of existing, relationships that would never make it into real life.<p>I feel free.<p>For the first time I took a walk in the park yesterday, rolled a joint, went for a nice breakfast and coffee at a local diner, read the newspaper, and just sat in the park. It was amazing not feeling pressure to make everyone immediately aware of how fucking awesome of a morning I&#x27;ve had. It was actually unreal. I just sat there looking at a bird and I almost just broke down and cried of happiness.<p>I felt zero pressure doing anything.<p>It felt as though I was obligated to post everything cool I did, so when doing those things, I&#x27;d do them differently just to fit the specific paradigm that I post in just to one up others.<p>A feeling has left me that I hadn&#x27;t identified before that I mistook as depression. I was growing more apathetic, sad, and cynical due to social media because it felt like every little thing I did was in competition in some form or another to others online, and when I failed, I just felt more isolated and lonely.<p>I&#x27;m able to do things consistently without the need to constantly check my phone and compare that specific frame of my life against others. Facebook on the toilet, while cleaning, running, on the bus, at work, on the commute home, too much.<p>The weeks following deleting my social media I got so much shit done so fast with no distractions. Absolutely amazing. I think I&#x27;ll write a blog post about this. I bought a tablet, loaded my favourite books on it, and have filled in all my pointless social media time with reading.<p>I&#x27;m actually discovering the city alone for the first time ever and it&#x27;s wonderful because I don&#x27;t care what anyone else thinks of what I&#x27;m doing, I&#x27;m doing it for <i>me</i>.<p>I&#x27;m going to grow my beard, cut my hair, buying some jeans, buying some chucks, and then I&#x27;m going to relax in a field somewhere and just spend time <i>not caring</i>.",1381863117

6555233,comment,6553374,6554325,3,0,sintaxi,,,"Great question. Harp is a great static site generator.<p>First of all, Harp works completely differently from SSGs like Jekyll in that it doesn&#x27;t regenerate the entire application every time you change a file. Instead, harp only generates the static assets as it needs to (in-memory) to serve any given request and it doesn&#x27;t spew out any files. This was throwing a lot of people off when they thought of it as an SSG because they were expecting harp generate a bunch of files and then serve those assets. So even though Harp has a `compile` function for exporting your application to static assets, it behaves and is built much more like static web server than a static site generator.<p>Second, Harp unlike Jekyll doesn&#x27;t have a strict convention of how your application is structured with a `_posts` directory and a `_layouts` directory. Instead, URLs with harp map directly to your file structure exactly as a static web server does. So if you want the url `/articles/hello-world` you must have a file in your project called `hello-world.md` or `hello-world.jade` in a directory called `articles`. The mental model of a web server translates much better to this paradigm.",1381861024

I was just speaking in more manageable/realistic terms.<p>>Why would they bother? Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to the entire Bitcoin network anyway. All the NSA would need is a handful of desktops and some auxiliary information about which wallets belong to which users (perhaps gather by watching Bitcoin exchanges). Bitcoin makes no anonymity guarantees at all.<p>Bitcoin is not anonymous, correct. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it is easy to break the barrier from pseudonymous - > known identity.<p>Let&#x27;s say there is a clever participant in the network, Satoshi, who is under investigation by the NSA. The NSA knows they will be sending 10btc to their cohort at address xyz. Satoshi is smart, he is not going to use an exchange to get his coins. Maybe he mined them. Maybe he got them in a f2f transaction.<p>This leaves few options to find out information about Satoshi.

I&#x27;d bet it has less to do with hoping MediaTemple can help them improve their customer service.

Every DNS resolver caching it will have accessed and cached it at different times, not just when you modified it.\n  2. Your original TTL could&#x27;ve been &#x27;too short&#x27; for some resolvers, and they substituted a larger value, which you don&#x27;t know.\n  3. Your TTL could&#x27;ve be too long and it expired, or cache was reset/filled, or cache too small, and it was dropped from cache.\n  4. The operator of the resolver could&#x27;ve chosen arbitrary TTL to assign to all records.\n</code></pre>\nSo instead of guessing across these scenarios, it gives a &#x27;sample&#x27; of how resolvers are handling your particular situation at a particular time, and gives some perspective into how other, non-reachable resolvers may also be handling things.<p>To one of your other points, keep in mind that many resolvers are stub resolvers, using an ISP&#x27;s name resolver, and so these DNS servers queried here may be in use by much larger audiences than you imagine.<p>Its certainly not a guarantee of much information, but Imagine scenarios:<p><pre><code>  A. You see that 90% of the returned resolvers are giving you the old record.\n  B.

6555181,comment,6544597,6552056,2,0,triplesec,,,"I love science. I sometimes practise science too, and my education in it is greater than most. Science is useful due to its empirical leanings and attempts to create ordered thought from this. I think you misunderstand my arguments, in that I appreciate and engage in activities which are scientific, and artistic, and aimed at human understanding, and understand that we need different methods depending on what we&#x27;re trying to discover. And that not all methods are science. You appear OTOH just to wish to say &quot;this is my hammer which I am going to use for everything.&quot;\n<br>\nSo:<p>>If you understood science, you would try to locate evidence for your claims. Science doesn&#x27;t revolve around rhetoric as you seem to believe -- it hinges on repeatable, objective evidence.<p>Then why are you arguing with bald assertions and no facts, if that is all you care about? why aren&#x27;t you being scientific about your claims here? Hoist by your own petard, I&#x27;m afraid.\n<br>\n>> And finally, that cartoon is one of Randall&#x27;s (rare) stupid cartoons.<p>>That would explain why it&#x27;s one of his best-known ones, posted everywhere. <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd</a> yields over 30,000 hits.<p>You are saying that popularity = truth? Seriously? Especially given the skewed population which &quot;likes&quot; that particular one? Ah, you really are a sophist. That&#x27;s really poor argumentation, poor thought and you really ought to understand this.\n<br>\n>> Sociology lives only on evidence.<p>>Absurd and false. Shall I tell you the Margaret Mead story, or can I rely on you to educate yourself? Mead&#x27;s career hinged on a ridiculous study that, in the form of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot;, became gospel among sociologists, even after those she originally interviewed confessed that they invented what they told her. It was a complete fabrication, yet it made Mead&#x27;s name in the field.\nThe Mead story is completely typical of the field. There&#x27;s a reason sociology ranks below psychology in the spectrum of pseudosciences.<p>Mead is not all sociologists. She&#x27;s an outlier anthrolologist, for starters, and nothing like, say Thorstein Veblen. I could equally say &quot;Science is fraudulent&quot; because scientists used to believe in Phlogiston. Absurd. You love the Straw Man!\n<br>\n>> Sociology requires entirely different methods from physical sciences because of the subject matter.<p>>There is one scientific method, not two or six. People who claim they&#x27;re doing a different kind of science, aren&#x27;t doing any kind of science.<p>Oh dear. There is only one scientific method, you say? You really have no clue. Start with Popper, and then Kuhn&#x27;s response, and google from there. And see the arguments between experimental and theorietical physicists while you&#x27;re at it, for fun. And then talk to some of the better professors in the different departments at you local university and see how much more sophisticated than you are at epistemology.<p>Even if there is only one &#x27;scientific method&#x27; (please define that, ha!) it remains that that statistical scientific method is not the only way to understand the world.\n<br>\n>> Purity? Purity of what? There&#x27;s no definition to that variable, which is meaningless except by nee-naah.\nYou obviously don&#x27;t understand the fatal flaw at the heart of post-modernism. But you know what? I&#x27;m not going to try to correct all the defects in your education. That would be an unrequited charity.<p>>Science is clearly defined, and for good reason -- everyone wants the stature of science without the discipline. Science is even defined in the law now, to prevent Creationists from using post-modern (i.e. &quot;it&#x27;s all opinion, there are no shared truths&quot;) arguments in order to get religious teaching into public schools.<p>To say there are more ways to understanding than one single method does not equal saying that all ideas are relative. That&#x27;s a false binary, and again an appalling straw man.<p>Get reading in the philosophy of science. You manifestly feel the need for certainty where actually there are interesting questions to be asked. None of my arguments are postmodern. Nor do I claim that sociology is the same as science. All I claim, quite plausibly given the evidence of the past 50-100 years, is that sociology is useful, it has empirically-verifiable methods, and that it does not need to be physical science to be useful.\n<br>\nHere&#x27;s a useful way to see the world:<p><a href=""http://comicsthatsaysomething.quora.com/A-Day-at-the-Park"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comicsthatsaysomething.quora.com/A-Day-at-the-Park</a>",1381860693

Adding the instability that comes with a turbulent, chaotic tech start up just compounds the issue and taxes one&#x27;s resilience even more, because inevitably one will have to pay attention to instabilities other than business related ones.<p>With respect to responsibility: having kids, a spouse and other similar obligations (can) act as a tether and definitely act as dividers of attention. A spouse and children necessarily require attention that could otherwise be focused on the business. This is really much more of a problem for individuals who aren&#x27;t already financially secure and depend on some relatively secure, stable income to support their lives.<p>The common element in both cases is time and attention: living an unstable life increases the probability of something other than the business acting as competition for attention, and living a life with other responsibilities &quot;baked in&quot; guarantees competition for attention.",1381860355

6555127,comment,6544597,6552056,2,0,triplesec,,,"I love science. I sometimes practise science too, and my education in it is greater than most. Science is useful due to its empirical leanings and attempts to create ordered thought from this. I think you misunderstand my arguments, in that I appreciate and engage in activities which are scientific, and artistic, and aimed at human understanding, and understand that we need different methods depending on what we&#x27;re trying to discover. And that not all methods are science. You appear OTOH just to wish to say &quot;this is my hammer which I am going to use for everything.&quot;<p>So:<p>>If you understood science, you would try to locate evidence for your claims. Science doesn&#x27;t revolve around rhetoric as you seem to believe -- it hinges on repeatable, objective evidence.<p>Then why are you arguing with bald assertions and no facts, if that is all you care about? why aren&#x27;t you being scientific about your claims here? You are hoist by your own petard, I&#x27;m afraid.<p>>> And finally, that cartoon is one of Randall&#x27;s (rare) stupid cartoons.\n>That would explain why it&#x27;s one of his best-known ones, posted everywhere. <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/#q=purity+xkcd</a> yields over 30,000 hits.<p>You are saying that popularity = truth? Seriously? Especially given the skewed population which &quot;likes&quot; that particular one? Ah, you really are a sophist. That&#x27;s really poor argumentation, poor thought and you really ought to understand this.<p>>> Sociology lives only on evidence.\n>Absurd and false. Shall I tell you the Margaret Mead story, or can I rely on you to educate yourself? Mead&#x27;s career hinged on a ridiculous study that, in the form of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot;, became gospel among sociologists, even after those she originally interviewed confessed that they invented what they told her. It was a complete fabrication, yet it made Mead&#x27;s name in the field.\nThe Mead story is completely typical of the field. There&#x27;s a reason sociology ranks below psychology in the spectrum of pseudosciences.<p>Mead is not all sociologists. She&#x27;s an outlier anthrolologist, for starters, and nothing like, say Thorstein Veblen. I could equally say &quot;Science is fraudulent&quot; because scientists used to believe in Phlogiston. Absurd. You love the Straw Man!<p>>> Sociology requires entirely different methods from physical sciences because of the subject matter.\n>There is one scientific method, not two or six. People who claim they&#x27;re doing a different kind of science, aren&#x27;t doing any kind of science.<p>Oh dear. There is only one scientific method, you say? You really have no clue. Start with Popper, and then Kuhn&#x27;s response, and google from there. And see the arguments between experimental and theorietical physicists while you&#x27;re at it, for fun. And then talk to some of the better professors in the different departments at you local university and see how much more sophisticated than you are at epistemology.<p>Even if there is only one &#x27;scientific method&#x27; (please define that, ha!) it remains that that statistical scientific method is not the only way to understand the world.<p>>> Purity? Purity of what? There&#x27;s no definition to that variable, which is meaningless except by nee-naah.\nYou obviously don&#x27;t understand the fatal flaw at the heart of post-modernism. But you know what? I&#x27;m not going to try to correct all the defects in your education. That would be an unrequited charity.\n>Science is clearly defined, and for good reason -- everyone wants the stature of science without the discipline. Science is even defined in the law now, to prevent Creationists from using post-modern (i.e. &quot;it&#x27;s all opinion, there are no shared truths&quot;) arguments in order to get religious teaching into public schools.<p>To say there are more ways to understanding than one single method does not equal saying that all ideas are relative. That&#x27;s a false binary, and again an appalling straw man.<p>Get reading in the philosophy of science. You manifestly feel the need for certainty where actually there are interesting questions to be asked. None of my arguments are postmodern. Nor do I claim that sociology is the same as science. All I claim, quite plausibly given the evidence of the past 50-100 years, is that sociology is useful, it has empirically-verifiable methods, and that it does not need to be physical science to be useful.<p>Here&#x27;s a useful way to see the world: <a href=""http://comicsthatsaysomething.quora.com/A-Day-at-the-Park"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comicsthatsaysomething.quora.com/A-Day-at-the-Park</a>",1381860349

6555123,comment,6554185,6554450,5,0,mikeho1999,,,"Matt, first of all, thanks to you and your team for posting in the comments on sites like HN, TechCrunch, and all the other sites where the news is starting to hit the tech community.  I know it can&#x27;t be easy to read so many critical comments against a company that I am sure has been a great place for you to work at.<p>However, I think trying to spin things as &quot;everything at (mt) will be the same... only better&quot; is a bit of a disservice to the tech community you are trying to reach out to, which is inherently more savvy about the reasoning and justification behind the acquisition itself.<p>In short: No company ever sets out to acquire another company to just keep things the same.<p>I do not doubt that in the <i>short term</i>, not much will change.  But starting within the next year or so, there is no doubt in anyone&#x27;s minds that the combined leadership team of GD and (mt) will begin to capitalize on business, product and technological &quot;synergies&quot; to help increase the bottom line.<p>That&#x27;s not a knock against you, GD, (mt) or anyone.  That&#x27;s just business.<p>But what does that mean for all of your existing (mt) customers?<p>GoDaddy&#x27;s modus operandi of profit maximization through questionable-at-best marketing practices, minimizing costs in customer and technical support, and taking any short cuts possible even at the detriment of the customer, does appear completely at odds with the high value of support and refined products that (mt) had prided itself over the years.<p>So the $400M question (or however much the acquisition was for) is: can these vastly different approaches of your business models be reconciled at all?  Or will one way end up &quot;winning out&quot; over the other way?  And if it&#x27;s the latter, who will end up &quot;winning out&quot;... the GoDaddy way, or the (mt) way?<p>I do apologize if I come up to some of my own conclusions ahead of time, but I hope you guys can prove me wrong.  But as I am now an outsider looking in, it ultimately won&#x27;t make too much of a difference to me -- I actually have been in the process (and am nearly complete) in moving all of my clients off of GoDaddy to AWS (for completely unrelated reasons, mostly dealing with pricing).<p>But as someone who had been a customer for over 8 years and as someone who had been an advocate for (mt), I couldn&#x27;t help from having the feeling of &quot;whew, I just dodged a bullet&quot; after hearing this news.",1381860330

807829,comment,807517,807793,0,0,ugh,,,"I don’t know if the story is that easy. Sure, as time progressed there were more custom parts. I played with Lego from 1992 (4) to 1999 (10) and remember that trend quite vividly. But it didn’t really get all that bad until I stopped playing Lego (no causal link there, by the way). Starting 2000 things really got out of hand. But when looking at current Lego sets I think we are back to 1999 or so levels of custom things. It has gotten better. Bionicle is a somewhat strange last remnant of that time. All the rest is pretty much normal again.<p>I would argue that there is nothing bad about current levels of custom things in Lego sets. In the 90s they simply became part of the brand. Lego sets are mostly standard blocks, but for good measure they will throw in a few custom things. I always liked that. I don’t think I would have enjoyed playing Lego so much with only standard blocks. The only thing I truly hate are stickers which glue together big parts of a set. I want custom printed blocks for that.",1252248195

All our systems are currently controlled by our brain - why would next-gen machines be any different in our ability to control them?<p>A guy I once met was partially blind. He decided to learn how to see again as he was sick of feeling his way around. He took the ""evolutionary"" option, by starting to walk extremely fast everywhere. For the first few weeks he had a few knocks and bruises as he ran into doors.

Your argument would show that it is the greed of the bricklayer and the roofer that is to blame for homelessness.<p>If you have a claim on others, for the funding of your medical treatment as an act of charity, it is a broad claim on society as a whole.

807809,comment,807117,807581,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Oh, gosh, where to begin ...<p>Actually, most of what I did are standard techniques that assembly programmers know, C programmers have seen, and web programmers don't need to bother with.<p>I can't actually post code here because it's commercial in confidence, yada yada yada, but I will mention the techniques.<p>Firstly, they were processing an entire image, then transforming it, then getting the part they wanted.  We tranformed the program flow to be demand-driven, which meant that large amounts of the image weren't processed at all because they weren't needed.<p>Then we analysed the data and deduced that by taking logs we only needed a dynamic range of 6 bits.  We therefore took the entire image into a byte map with the top two bits of each byte set to 0.<p>Processing 4 bytes at a time in words saved enormous amounts of memory access, and avoided register spills.  Unrolling loops by the right amount meant that we stayed in cache, but had less overhead.<p>Once the processing had been re-worked, we looked at the assembly produced, and found that most of the time the processing could be separated into a double indirection.<p>Finally, by further reducing the resolution of the system, computing an approximation, then reworking those parts of the data where the errors were too large we managed to halve the work being done.<p>It was a good two days of analysis, and the code shrank by a factor of 2, but it's now tough to understand.  We have documented the results.  It's embedded work, and yes, we finally went to assembly to get the last 30% of performance.<p>Every part of it is standard in its field.  I think some of my programmers hadn't created routines to work byte-wise eight bytes at a time in a 64 bit word, and others hadn't done the transform via logs to throw away unnecessary resolution.  Another had never analysed unrolling a loop as compared with staying in cache. We used tricks such as (x & -x) to find the least bit of a number, although in 32-bit space that becomes something like (x & (!x + 0x01010101)).<p>And so on.  A large collection of esoteric tricks, all at once.<p>Let me finish by saying that programs can't be made to run faster, they can only be made to do less work.  An interesting aphorism when ""optimised"" code.",1252246772

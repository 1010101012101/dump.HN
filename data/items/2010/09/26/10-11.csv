1728960,comment,1728055,1728934,0,0,alextp,,,"But these places arise precisely from the fact that they're not empty. Most chinatowns/koreatowns are in places where, back when the immigration wave was happenning, there was cheap housing that was close  enough to local commerce. As soon as one or two immigrants went there, friends and family followed, and soon there was a powerful support network for immigrants, and the community thrived. You can't build that in an empty space.<p>And upgrading is handled well enough today by (a) knocking down old buildings and build new, bigger ones (except this doesn't sit well with planning) and (b) expanding the city to a different direction that can be developed according to market values and needs, which also undercuts planning (since these new areas won't at first have the infrastructure of an urban center).",1285498440

1728958,comment,1728055,1728828,0,0,alextp,,,"This is not a trivial question when you touch on mining-related issues. One can only become that rich by an artificial scarcity that is created when one person/company ""owns"" a part of land it bought way below value (since the true value should include all the billions of mined material). Also, anyone could mine the land, so it's not like farming, where skill really matters.<p>I don't think there can be a trivial answer to this question of who has the money that, in practice, is just lying there for the taking",1285498222

This is independent of whether they learned any form of engineering in school or not.<p>As far as the bar exam being a joke, if that's true, that's broken. If the more important thing is going to law school for 3 years, then why put so much emphasis on the bar exam t all? There are people who graduate to law school but never pass the exam, or the ones who try and try again and pass it on their 4th or 5th try, if they went to school why isn't that meaningful? Either the schooling isn't all that it's cracked up to be or the metric doesn't measure the right things, but either way there's an impedance mismatch which means the system is broken.",1285497800

I would guess the gist of this project is:  built in browser dom api is fine, we don't need any abstractions.<p>So... what changed in the last 6 years? I would say: nothing. The dom is still a clusterfuck of an api. Poorly documented, and with core things still not cross browser compatibile (like setting attributes).<p>Luckily jQuery has taken over. Not that it's perfect or anything (I have major issues with lots of it), but it provides a base level of functionality that any sane web developer needs.<p>Hell, at this point, browsers should just bundle it (only loaded locally if the specific version is requested, falling back to http).",1285496340

If there is one thing that has burned me too many times it is visual programming.  Visual programming, to me, converts somatic gestures into black-box code.  I love casting magic spells, but the lack of tools make them hard to fix:  You must start from scratch for a small change.<p>I believe the solution is textual: Where different text means different things, and text can be edited to correct your mistakes.   This means SQL will stay.<p>On another subject, I can see how Model/View separation is causing great pain.  Separating a simple view into 2+ files makes a distinction without a measurable benefit.  How often has your model changed without touching the view?  And when it did, would having it all in one file make that change harder?<p>From my little experience, the majority cases leave Models and Views in a 1-1 correspondence.    I agree with swix that current languages make those cases needlessly difficult.",1285495638

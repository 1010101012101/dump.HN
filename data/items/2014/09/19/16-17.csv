But if you believe it is not natural, try thinking mathematically (without nouns or names as unique aliasable identifiers). Or without isa or hasa relationships.<p>Is-a and Has-a relationships don&#x27;t require class-based OO structures to express in a language. E.g., both membership in a abstract group sharing a common interface (is-a) and composition (has-a) relationships are readily expressed in FP languages like Haskell quite directly, or in languages that are more like traditional OO langauges but which separate interface from implementation rather than combining them as is done in class-based OO.<p>The OO approach to programming, and thinking about domains, has broad utility, but the particulars of static, class-based OOP are not necessary to realize that utility.",1411145578

8341274,comment,8341017,8341149,6,0,anon1385,,,"I would call myself a socialist and my biggest reason for disliking Uber is that it is filling the highways with drivers who no longer have valid insurance, and whose vehicles are not adhering to the level of maintenance checks usually required for commercial vehicles that spend all day on the road. So anti-Uber sentiment can exist for much more mundane reasons like insurance coverage.<p>The comoditization of labour (skilled and unskilled - don&#x27;t think that you are immune) is already well underway anyway, and Uber makes little difference to the process. The number of Uber drivers is tiny compared to the number of warehouse pickers, fast food workers, cleaners, social carers, designers, labourers, mechanics etc etc who are on zero hours contracts or have been reclassified as self employed contractors.<p>The main reason to talk about Uber is that it&#x27;s in the public consciousness at the moment, not because transport drivers are a special case. I guess it also has a lot of high profile backers. So we can talk about how Paul Graham thinks European countries lack &#x27;entrepreneurial spirit&#x27; because they want drivers on their roads to be insured. Uber is a case where the capitalists got their order of attack slightly off. They needed to &#x27;disrupt&#x27; the idea of insurance first, because at the moment there is a widespread understanding of the need for driver insurance and going against that just makes you look like a massive asshole. It&#x27;s always helpful in a debate when your opponent keeps scoring own-goals, as Ubers cheerleaders do.<p>The example of Uber is appealing, because it&#x27;s probably an easy victory. Maybe Uber will get insurance laws rewritten and in a few years we will all be enjoying the freedom of driving on roads without the regulative burden of mandatory insurance. That won&#x27;t be an easy argument to win though, even with massive wealth of their backers and assistance from lobbyists like ALEC . So I strongly disagree with your description of anti-uber sentiment as doomed to failure.",1411145411

You can&#x27;t get contractors without clients and if you don&#x27;t have contractors, clients won&#x27;t want to wait. The problem has been getting worse with the rise of the internet and global connectivity as these companies can more easily expand into an entire industry and quickly dominate the technology side.<p>This domination of the tech side of old industries makes it especially hard for tech companies that want to disrupt the &quot;old&quot; companies because the market often assumes there is only room for one technological provider/disruptor per market service. This is similar to the first to market principle. If you get your service out there and generating new users before your competitor, you have an innate advantage over all the competition AND a great advantage over future companies using a similar model to yours. In the process of shutting out new, small tech companies, the competition is narrowed down to the &quot;old&quot; companies/interests in which the tech company has a clear new, tech-inspired advantage over, else why would they be called a disrupting tech startup?<p>So you have situations where 1 tech company, slowly morphing into a giant, effectively shuts out both the entrenched interests who cannot adapt fast enough to stem the hemorrhage of customers and the new interests who can&#x27;t compete on either  price or availability without a long ramp up and generally necessary venture capital.

An anxiety attack for me is something that comes on very suddenly, leaving me with an overwhelming sense of impending doom. Usually it&#x27;s a feeling that I&#x27;m about to lose control or drop dead right then and there. The thought that often goes through my head is, &quot;oh no, something isn&#x27;t right, this can&#x27;t be right, I have to call an ambulance&quot; or &quot;I have to get out of here, now!&quot;. When the attack passes, it is followed by feeling extremely jittery, weak and anxious for hours or even days. During the attack, any number of physiological symptoms present, including pounding heart, feeling like I might pass out, wind, diarrhea, feeling weak, etc.<p>I did suffer from mild and occasional depression when younger. It seemed to be more of a feeling of disappointment with various things in life leading to an extended malaise, but with a chemical origin (brain chemistry). (I think of such episodes as &quot;chemical depression&quot; as opposed to &quot;ordinary depression&quot;.)<p>But because anxiety and depression can often go together, it is not usually so easy to distinguish them.<p>I read that sunshine and aerobic exercise help with both depression and anxiety (in my case exercise helped more than normal since I used to be overweight; a contributor to my depression at the time).<p>Treating either depression or anxiety seems to require a multi-pronged approach. Most important in my experience seems to be teaching yourself (or be taught) how to shut down unproductive thought patterns as soon as they occur. They are habits which apparently exacerbate both issues (not necessarily immediately, but cumulatively).<p>For anxiety, ruthlessly removing sources of anxiety (especially initially) can be helpful in the long run. Being blunt with people and simply telling them what the issues are that are stressing you out, and how much of an impact that is having on you, can help. Bottling up those issues and being unassertive and endlessly constructing &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios before or after the fact, exacerbates the problem.<p>For anxiety, cut out caffeine and other stimulants. Avoid intense anaerobic stress (e.g. heavy weightlifting or aerobic exercise past the point of exhaustion), which stresses the nervous system. Also keeping the system running smoothly (e.g. modifying your diet for smooth digestive transit and controlling any allergies with standard hayfever antihistamines) seems to substantially lower overall stress levels.<p>And obviously there are pharmaceutical options if you consult people qualified to dispense them.<p>At some point you begin to realise you haven&#x27;t had any real attacks in a while and that you are recovering. That relief in itself helps in the recovery process for anxiety (which I have heard can take months or even years in some individuals).",1411144549

I quit my (soul-crushing) job three months ago and plan on living off my savings until I manage to gather the energy to find another one (or to kill myself). I&#x27;m 29 and never had a girlfriend either. I feel utterly invisible to the opposite gender, as if there was some kind of unexplainable communication gap that I never managed to cross, while everyone else (including the countless couples of teenagers I see walking in the parks) just seems to have moved past that. For me this is the thing that kills me the most. I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted the best years in my life, and that because of that and missing out on some basic experiences that most people share, I feel extremely alienated from the rest of my peers. So I just fake it all. I lie about my life. I live like an impostor, and when someone is about to uncover that, I just run away or make up more excuses and lies.<p>I&#x27;ve got a few good friends, but they are far away. I&#x27;ve still got my family though, but I haven&#x27;t told them about my depression. I actually have told no one except one friend, who was supportive but didn&#x27;t really understand what I&#x27;m going through. I&#x27;ve been depressed for as long as I can remember, since I was a teenager I guess. Something like 10 years. I&#x27;ve also been thinking of suicide for years now, on a weekly, sometimes daily and hourly basis. The biggest problem is that I don&#x27;t see the purpose of life. Most people will talk about family (children), career, religion... Things that don&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t believe in any gods, I don&#x27;t want any children (who would inevitably inherit my shitty genes) and my career is nowhere near where I would have wanted it to be, to the point that I was better off right out of college because I was mentally more apt then than now that I&#x27;m burnt out. (And lost almost all passion for programming)<p>I probably some form of ADD as well, because I&#x27;ve lost almost all ability to focus when trying to work on programming projects.<p>Right now I&#x27;m far away from home, taking holidays in the sun, and trying new hobbies. But nothing ever seems to stick (including meditation, which I&#x27;ve failed to pick up many times now). I&#x27;ve met people, but ultimately there is always a moment where I&#x27;m alone in a room and start wondering what is the point of going through all that. Life is ultimately absurd and we&#x27;re all gonna die anyway.<p>Even writing this message feels utterly stupid. It&#x27;s probably the worse answer that one could write to your message. Usually when I write these kind of messages, I tend to write them and immediately delete them because I feel so silly and pathetic. For once I&#x27;m gonna hit the reply button anyway.",1411144019

There are instances where this model can be fair to all parties, but there are also obviously instances where it&#x27;s abusive.<p>My intuition, which is probably wrong, is that the model fails most straightforwardly when there are monopsonies playing the &quot;source and allocate&quot; role.

If any result in crime rates resulted from social reforms advocated in the 1960s and 1970s (which is questionable), its more like it was the interruptions in the long-running trend of increasing crime rates, not the increase that started more than a decade before the reforms were advocated.<p>Demographics in the key criminal age demographic -- both from the demobilizations after the WWII and Korea, and then the Baby Boom, is probably the key factor driving the increase (and subsequent decrease as that demographic bulge passed that age band.)",1411143348

Moz raised their money at a really tricky time because it was right before Google essentially bent over the SEO industry. When Rand mentions the Content tool that hasn&#x27;t even started being developed, that was something that was supposed to take your Google Analytics keyword referrer data and match it to your content and your rankings and your links and your competitors and basically help you spot keywords and content you can easily rank better for.<p>The timeline seems to be matching up where they had this plan for this tool before any of the Google SSL stuff started, so as they started working on the design and UX of it, Google started rolling out the SSL stuff and it basically ruined their idea. Moz ended up adding tools to try and guess what keywords made up your &quot;(not provided)&quot; data but that&#x27;s a far cry from what they were originally planning.<p>I&#x27;m basing this entirely on being heavily involved in the SEO industry around the times mentioned in Rand&#x27;s article and having even run a successful SEO SaaS product (which is still going even though I&#x27;ve moved on to other projects). I just remember seeing screenshots of what they wanted to build and thinking &quot;wow, if they can nail this, it will be great&quot;. I wanted to build a similar app. But when Google started hiding all organic keyword data in analytics, I distinctly remember saying &quot;Well there goes Moz&#x27;s whole new product&quot;.<p>Google really fucked the SEO world up with their (not provided) move. Think what you will about SEO but it&#x27;s still a legitimate marketing channel and I really have never been able to understand why Google thinks it&#x27;s ok to not share your organic keyword data but your paid keyword data is totally fine to share with site owners.<p>But not much anyone can do about that now I suppose.",1411143293

Years ago, I ran into a serious issue with Google Desktop, and the bug was poorly documented.<p>Their maps data in Johannesburg has some annoying data issues, and is rewriting the geography of the city, because it is relied on by third party sites. They do respond to some Maps reports, and other problems can be fixed in Map Maker, but some are too big.<p>The common thread in these problems is that Google has very poor feedback mechanisms - a problem that has existed for years. Given their success in organising data, you&#x27;d think there would be a way for them to handle feedback efficiently, and in a standardised way across products.

It would be worth $0.<p>That&#x27;s not true at all. The Euro was launched as a completely new currency in 1995, across a huge and diverse group of economies and backed only by trust in the ECB. The value of the Euro has remained remarkably stable, launching at 1EUR=1.12USD, peaking in 2008 at 1.59USD and currently trading at 1.35USD. The biggest increase in the value of the Euro happened as a result of the declining value of other currencies during the US financial crisis.<p>BTC is in the midst of a vast speculative bubble. It isn&#x27;t a currency in any real sense, as the vast majority of the trading volume is purely speculative. A currency is defined by liquidity and there just aren&#x27;t many things you can currently exchange for a bitcoin.

So their AWS workload is probably just not that demanding. What runs on AWS is just a bunch of scripts for selecting which videos to stream. Since the costs of hosting these scripts are negligible compared to the cost of streaming videos, Netflix just doesn&#x27;t care about the fact that they are overpaying.  If something is responsible for 0.1% of your costs, the fact that you&#x27;re paying 2 to 10 times more for it is easy to ignore.  That&#x27;s the reason why they still use AWS.  Their needs are not particularly elastic, in my opinion.  Yes, people probably access Netflix more often in the evenings and weekends, but that is true of just about every entertainment website or blog, and it doesn&#x27;t make AWS cost-effective.",1384763853

There is some evidence that many miners have sold most of their early stockpiles. The min-1-year bitcoin-days-destroyed chart (sum of [coin amount * coin age in days] for coin groups older than a year [1]) shows this to a degree. The metric is also an underestimation of older stockpile movement, as any transaction (even between one&#x27;s own addresses) will reset age to 0. But it is still hard to say for sure.<p>One twist about bitcoin is that most early adopters are strongly invested ideologically and/or emotionally, reducing some of the potential dumping power. The next year or two should be rather interesting. I could see some large corrections, but each month that passes gives bitcoin more staying power/legitimacy. So far, each downtrend has only resulted in a later movement to much higher levels.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blockchain.info/charts/bitcoin-days-destroyed-min-year?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address="" rel=""nofollow"">http://blockchain.info/charts/bitcoin-days-destroyed-min-yea...</a>",1384762537

As of July 2013, the use of Bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace is relatively small compared with the use by speculators.</i><p>It reminds me of a similar analysis I read of Amway -- how only a small percentage of the products ever make it to retail consumers.<p>If you have a currency that is supposed to end in consumer exchange but can&#x27;t make it back down to that level, what is it really? It&#x27;s a huge bubble that will have to go through many more transformations before ending up back in your wallet. Maybe by that time the gov&#x27;t will have figured out how to tax it, or more exchanges will have disappeared.<p>I don&#x27;t know, seems odd. An interesting risk for those who believe in easy money, but it&#x27;s strange to me that a gamble that so many are making would pay off for everyone involved.

Once the price started to rise I think maybe it ceased being a viable currency and instead became a fantasy for those wanting to trade it at a profit. I mean, the price of currency isn&#x27;t supposed to be so volatile, right? If the USD for example, were jumping around like this would people invest in it?

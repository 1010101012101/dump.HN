I wish all distros worked like this.\nI had never heard of Guix before and was about to ask how it relates to / differs from Nix, so if anyone else is wondering:<p>Guix:<p><pre><code>    Specializes in providing exclusively free software.\n    Based on Nix [2].\n    Implementation differences, quoted from section 2.3 in [3]:</code></pre>\n&quot;Our main contribution with GNU Guix is the use of Scheme for both the composition and description of build processes, and the implementation of build scripts. In other words, Guix builds upon the build and deployment primitives of Nix, but replaces the Nix language by Scheme with embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs), and promotes Scheme as a replacement for Bash in build scripts. Guix is implemented using GNU Guile 2.0 2 , a rich implementation of Scheme based on a compiler and bytecode interpreter that supports the R5RS and R6RS standards. It reuses the build primitives of Nix by making remote procedure calls (RPCs) to the Nix build daemon.\nWe claim that using an embedded DSL has numerous practical benefits over an independent DSL: tooling (use of Guile’s compiler, debugger, and REPL, Unicode support, etc.), libraries (SRFIs, internationalization support, etc.), and seamless integration in larger programs. To illustrate this last point, consider an application that traverses the list of available packages and processes it—for instance to filter packages whose name matches a pattern, or to render it as HTML. A Scheme program can readily and efficiently do it with Guix, where packages are first-class Scheme objects; conversely, writing such an implementation with an external DSL such as Nix requires either extending the language implementa- tion with the necessary functionality, or interfacing with it via an external representation such as XML, which is often inefficient and lossy.\nWe show that use of Scheme in build scripts is natural, andcan achieve conciseness comparable to that of shell scripts, but with improved expressivity and clearer semantics.&quot;<p>From my limited view, Nix has a very strong theoretical base. Do you expect any developments at that level, and do you think these hypothetical developments will be integrated by the developers of Guix, or might it at some point start ignoring improvements in the theory?<p>[1] <a href=""http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584</a>",1447862380

The older you get the less a year or two matters matters.<p>By the time you&#x27;re 30, no one (not even yourself) will notice that you are 2 years behind your peers (based on whatever metric you&#x27;re using). In fact, the older you get, the harder it is to measure what being 2 years behind even means.<p>And, just think about the huge variations in life span. Say, for example, George finished college 2 years later than Bob. However, George lived to 90 and was able to do productive work right up to the end, and Bob died at 78. George had an entire extra decade, even though he had a slightly later start.",1447861888

Even NT, which is a serious multi-user kernel, was a product of 1990s C programming style. And while that&#x27;s true of the Unices of the time as well, none of them had Microsoft&#x27;s absurd user base, and so none of them had the same terrible malware incentives.<p>This all came to a head around 2001-2003, when the Internet worm phenomenon got so bad that Microsoft was routinely on the front page of CNN, and serious talk of congressional action began.<p>From what I understand, there was a dramatic top-down response, led by Gates and Ballmer, requiring software security training for developers, giving product managers the power to slip release dates to ensure bugs were caught, and funding what I believe is probably the largest 3rd-party software pentesting program in the industry. Several well-known software security firms (my old firm, Matasano, not really among them) were basically bootstrapped out of Microsoft contracts.<p>Today, Google probably does a better job on software security than Microsoft does, but it&#x27;s hard to come up with another rival.

Maybe a very simple mental hash function would be enough; mass attacks would probably be foiled, and individual attackers may be too lazy to bother figuring out the hash.<p>There remains the problem of changing the password due to some necessity, like policy or compromise.<p>EDIT: If this was app-based, then each time you change a password, the app would record that fact, and incorporate it into the hashing data, so that a different hash is generated. The problem then being synchronizing that fact among all your installations of the app. And if you were using a mental hash, I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d remember this across all your logins; possibly some central piece of data that you could easily look up, to see that you&#x27;ve changed your password one or two or N times, that is easy to incorporate into the mental hash.",1447860052

This was often rubber stamped but it at least gave a paper trail and the police had to have their ducks in a row (e.g. it would be easier to detect if a cop or spook was spying on their ex-wife/ex-husband, since no warrant, no paper trail).<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is: Why is getting a warrant now seen as something that is optional/avoidable? Several Western countries (UK, US, and several other european ones) have passed laws designed so that warrants can be avoided in certain cases (and none of those cases are &quot;immediate threat to life&quot;).<p>Mass surveillance is taking that to a whole different level: Now nobody needs a warrant for anyone. They&#x27;re only limited by internal rules. And we already know that spooks often utilise this to spy on their friends/family/love interests.<p>So, no, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed. Police surveillance with a warrant from a judge is still ok. Targeted surveillance via spooks with a warrant is also ok. Untargeted surveillance and or no warrant remains unacceptable even after the Paris attacks.",1447859325

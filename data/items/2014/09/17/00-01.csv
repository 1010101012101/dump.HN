8327924,comment,8325441,8327719,16,0,bane,,,"Yeah it kind of depends how you look at it. Is it specialty software that provides some critical function they can&#x27;t get elsewhere? Or is it Microsoft Office, everybody gets it and it should really be like $150/seat.<p>I should have also added to my original post, this is their GSA schedule. For these specific line-items, the government considers this the &quot;prenegotiated lowest price&quot;. This simplifies purchasing. So if somebody in the government wants buy another core (item 132-33) they just ring up Palantir or their GSA schedule VAR (reseller) and ask for a 132-33 volume:1 and they know that it&#x27;ll cost $141k and be good for 1 year of O&M.<p>The downside of being on the GSA schedule is that it means that there are limits on your ability to change prices year to year to reflect a change in business environment. Say next year you want to drop the price by 50%. That&#x27;s not allowed, since it would basically mean that you weren&#x27;t selling your software at the lowest possible prenegotiated price. Similarly if you want to increase it, you&#x27;re limited in that as well. I think the +- variance can&#x27;t exceed 10% in a single 12 month period, but I might be wrong. The other downside is that this basically provides your prices in public so your competitors can see what you charge, which can be critical information in contract bids.<p>There&#x27;s always a loophole. For example, convince your customer to not buy off of the GSA and sell them a &quot;package&quot; at some discount off of GSA. That &quot;package&quot; counts as a different SKU and the GSA doesn&#x27;t apply. So for example, you could make a Palantir &quot;starter kit&quot; composed of<p><pre><code>   2 core license (normally $282k)\n   1 extra year of O&M maintenance for both cores (normally $56k)\n   500 hours of Ninja Services @ $150/hr (normally $98k)\n   500 hours of CONUS FSR Service @ $120/hr (normally $73k)\n</code></pre>\nall for the grand total of $350k or some such, instead of the normal price of $510k. A $160k discount.<p>Any government purchaser would fall over themselves to try to make this happen since it&#x27;s a >30% discount off of the normal GSA schedule prices (which they can refer to and are governed by various rules). This looks fantastic on their yearly performance eval &quot;-saved government $160k on purchase of Palantir package deal&quot;<p>This is the crack model. When the O&M runs out in two years and they come asking for more, well, there&#x27;s no deal anymore, and the GSA schedule prices on O&M and people have gone up 20% in that time.<p><i>edit</i> keep in mind that this company has raised almost a <i>billion</i> dollars and is valued at something like $9 billion dollars.",1410915408

8327889,comment,8326501,8327625,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"An excellent summary. I believe that a lot of the work we&#x27;re doing on NN classifiers is based on a rather shaky notion of bootstrapping a collection of platonic ideals, one at a time.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking about this from the opposite perspective, as I have a lot of cats and a large and rather neurotic German Shepherd (all rescue animals that basically came up to us). I mention the dog being neurotic because he went through a phase of reacting to <i>anything</i> in his size class, such as rocking horses and small goods trolleys, and is still inclined to react to things like his own shadow or reflection in a window if it catches him unawares. He&#x27;s very interested in the cats but given his size and volume they don&#x27;t appreciate his attentions and I worry more about him catching a stray claw in the eye than I do about him biting one of them, so currently they have to admire each other from a distance. I spend a lot of time with the dog every day (partly because my wife isn&#x27;t able to handle him physically) and we also look after and train a neighbor&#x27;s Shepherd pups.<p>Not being a dog person I&#x27;ve had to spend a lot of time learning how to think like a dog, or model the dogs&#x27; model of the world, and make gradual modifications to it, often by subverting existing behaviors. ISTM that the trouble with back-propagation algorithms in NN classifiers is that we are establishing and then polishing a recognition reflex, and at best this is going to yield only insect-like behavior. Now such hardwired behavior in insects can be pretty elaborate and impressive, more so in social insects; but it&#x27;s an inherently reactive model. Consider instead a neural network with two outputs, GET and IDENTIFY. The IDENTIFY part is more or less the same as what we have now; when stimulated it is trained to classify input as DOG or CAT, and if it does so correctly we &#x27;reward&#x27; it by propagating those output weightings back into the network.<p>But I&#x27;d like to see (or be made aware of) one that also tries to GET input, either input it has already classified or new and therefore &#x27;exciting&#x27; input. My dogs sometimes want predictable rewards, such as snacks, access to the outside, or various kinds of play (so do my cats but they have different and rather more zero-sum approaches to getting what they&#x27;re after). But they also need a degree of novelty and mental challenge which requires them to expand their world model. I&#x27;ve been experimenting for a while now with hide-and-seek games using a ball for the oldest dog and (casually) monitoring how he divides his time between iterating over known hiding locations and novel ones, sequences of known locations and so on. Of course he can &#x27;cheat&#x27; by using his sense of smell to rack where I&#x27;ve been, but I&#x27;ve managed to train him out of that by using various cheats of my own to make that unreliable.<p>My takeaway from this is that successful world-modeling is not its own reward but seems to be emergent from a framework of interdependent reflexive behavior, and require a temporal as well as a spatial dimension. Indeed, one of the trickiest aspects of this game was getting the dog to wait for me. Right now I have to show him the ball, then have him stay while I wander away(completely out of his sight) for some indeterminate length of time, following which I return and tell him to start searching, which I may or may not monitor directly. So he has to model both that I&#x27;ll be coming back <i>and</i> that I&#x27;ve left something in the environment for him to retrieve. He worked this part out quite quickly and it took some extra time to get him to wait for my say-so before doing the retrieval as soon as he sees me reappear.<p>I feel that for our machine learning progress to advance we need both first-order classifiers of the kind described in this article and second-order classifiers that are orthogonal to the first and classify the first-order classification events into meta-patterns.<p>I&#x27;d be grateful if anyone could point out work already being done in this area. I don&#x27;t keep up with the academic literature in any sort of organized way so this is probably a case of reinventing the wheel.",1410914776

If you restrict yourself to the range of world-class athletes, I grant that performance in archery will correlate negatively with performance in sprinting.  This is just Berkson&#x27;s paradox, or the &quot;restriction of range&quot; phenomenon.  If you consider the entire population, however, I would be very surprised if a &quot;general factor of fitness&quot; didn&#x27;t fall right out of a battery of athletic tests.  In general, people who are faster than average will also be stronger than average and probably more dextrous too, and it makes sense to call that factor &quot;physical fitness&quot;.",1410914257

8327811,comment,8326658,8327521,3,0,rcoder,,,"This is the silliest argument for why intelligence would be negatively correlated with number of children. FWIW, the original article very much did not assert that assertion; reproductive <i>success</i> (meaning having any children at all survive the parents) in fact may be positively correlated because the social status of richer/more intelligent parents translates to higher survival rates for their offspring.<p>Regardless, while the absolute cost of raising children may be higher for high-income families, the share of their total income that represents is much lower. Someone earning minimum wage will struggle to support even one child&#x27;s basic food, clothing, and shelter; their counterpart making $1M a year could easily afford private school, childcare, and the best possible opportunities for a family of 3-4 children.",1410912666

7538230,comment,7537903,7537903,18,0,sharkweek,,,"SEO-driven businesses are super fun to work on and run -- I have a few sites that rank for informational queries and thus get a decent amount of search traffic and ad revenue because of it. At scale, it can quickly become highly lucrative.<p>HOWEVER, and perhaps call me a giant wuss, but when you&#x27;re at the mercy of not only an algorithm but also a savvy business, it&#x27;s a pretty dangerous bet to hedge it all on search traffic.<p>Coupon codes are one of those things I could easily see appearing at the top of SERPs in no time courtesy of Google.<p>&quot;Credit card comparisons&quot; and other searches like it are a massively profitable keyword to rank for. But take a peek now and you&#x27;ll see Google threw their hat into the ring, flipped one switch and magically appear above all organic rankings. They&#x27;re doing the same thing with travel, weather, you name it. I can&#x27;t sit here and argue it&#x27;s unfair, it&#x27;s their yard, they make the rules.<p>And truthfully, as a user, I completely applaud Google for providing these services, I love the one stop shop and trustworthy nature of their results.<p>As a marketer, I&#x27;m very, very wary to place any huge bets on any sort of long term business model relying on rankings. Should it be a tactic in your strategy? Absolutely. But diversification here is sure going to save a lot of headaches down the road.<p>But at the end of the day, as far as RetailMeNot goes, get it while it&#x27;s good I suppose.",1396727984

It&#x27;s just not more widespread because, unfortunately, cattle replaced all other protein sources in most places, specially in the west, where we apparently created a beef addiction.<p>Here in Brazil there&#x27;s a dish that involves flour and fried ants. It&#x27;s delicious, tastes like shrimp, but I only tasted once since it&#x27;s rare. Ant-eating is an influence from native americans. In Cambodia there&#x27;s also deep fried tarantula. I never ate it, but apparently it&#x27;s also delicious, tastes like crab.<p>Basically, most insects once deep fried will taste like shrimp or crab, so not bad.<p>There should be more available, since they are apparently way more efficient (and clean) to produce than cattle. Cutting down the forest to raise beef on grass, or cramming a bunch of mammals in a warehouse then wasting money on antibiotics <i>doesn&#x27;t make any sense</i>.",1396727934

I would define it thus: &quot;the algorithm should return a list of sites ordered according to the likelihood of the user finding them engaging.&quot; Very quickly you need to decide if you are personalizing this list per-user or not. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not.<p>With this definition we can go places because:\n1. There is a huge literature on measuring engagement; and\n2. There is a huge literature on generating rankings.<p>For the former we can start by looking here: <a href=""http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~mounia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~mounia/</a> (There&#x27;s lots more work in the field. I just happen to have some familiarity with her work.) For the latter searching for &quot;submodular diversity ranking&quot; will return a lot of papers with complicated algorithms. Yay!<p>The number one problem I see is that you don&#x27;t have sufficient information to get a useful measurement of engagement. If you don&#x27;t have useful feedback you can&#x27;t learn if what you&#x27;re suggesting is any good. At the minimum you want to measure clickthrough. Better would be time-on-page (possibly normalised by page length). Solve this problem, even poorly, and we can them look at using this to generate rankings.<p>As for generating rankings, while the submodular optimisation approach has some very nice properties (e.g. it maintains diversity in the suggestions) there are simpler methods to start with. Let&#x27;s say we have some measure of engagement. We can put a confidence interval on this measure using standard maths. Then just display the sites that have the higher upper bound on the confidence interval. You should decay the measure over time, widening the confidence interval, to allow for changing interests.<p>Hope that&#x27;s useful.",1396726770

7538141,comment,7511749,7512258,0,0,vfclists,,,"I just got my first taste of HN censorship from my earlier comment about the reason why a white father insisting on describing his mixed race son as black is quite wrong and the subconsciously racist intent underlying it, love of offspring notwithstanding. I am rephrasing it and restarting it.<p>If the writer is white then the son is arguably as white as he is black, and probably more white than black if the mother is an African American, as opposed to an African immigrant. So why the insistence on the father labeling him as black just because society sees him as such? Society can learn to see him as white if white fathers insist on claiming whiteness for him. Why does the notion of whiteness exclude any racial mixture when black does? Why should whiteness be exclusive and the father go along with that?<p>The real issue is the way society is programmed by calculated use of language. If the One Drop Rule was switched around most racial discrimination would end, because discrimination would then be based on shade of complexion not race. Whites would be light-skinned whites, mixed race people would simply be medium-skinned whites and most African Americans would be dark-skinned whites from their slave-owning fathers. Or the definition could be reversed and white people would be very light-skinned blacks. The idiocy of this defacto continuation of the ODR is that is that it makes whiteness exclusive and black becomes some kind of genetic taint, some kind of condition/affliction which causes lots people who are &#x27;white&#x27; socially, genetically and culturally for all practical purposes to be labelled as &#x27;black&#x27;.<p>That rule was made to ensure that wealth and privilege remained in the hands of white people, to ensure the formation of a predominantly and visibly white aristocracy and check the breeding preferences of resident or immigrant European nobility whose appearance was visibly that of light-skinned blacks. Take this instance of a prince of Liechtenstein <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LMfYsqYUdxY/UCaj_85tH2I/AAAAAAAAEU..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LMfYsqYUdxY/UCaj_85tH2I/AAAAAAAAEU...</a>. If American had more men like his father in ranking positions, his complexion might even be identified with aristocracy and how often would police harass males like him and risk losing their jobs? By being labeled as black it only helps rationalize the harassment.<p>What is there to stop white fathers insisting that their sons be seen as white and have all the privileges that come with it and punish policemen who stepped out of line? This father&#x27;s refusal to view and label his son as white masks a hardly unconscious reluctance to demand the same privileges he has for his son and by extension any other men of a similar appearance. If they got to be seen as white and also married black females the same privilege would be extended to their even darker sons and this issue would simply go away.<p>The continued use of black to describe mixed race people, even multiple generations of &#x27;blacks&#x27; who are mixed is simply a refusal to accept the fact that a white and Nordic-oriented exclusivity in a multiracial America is a myth, downright anomalous and is actually Nazism of the worst kind. Isn&#x27;t it glaringly obvious how Hispanic is used to pull in lots of people who would be Black, Native American or both under the One Drop Rule, ie &#x27;light-skinned blacks&#x27;?<p>Unfortunately the use of the term black by that white father is just a sop to white exclusivity supremacists.<p>European is a culture not a race.",1396726257

A: Convince the other countries to get rid of [slavery|child labor|80 hour work weeks|polluting the waterways] as well. My answer is similar - if Norway&#x27;s desire to support the human rights of the disabled is so burdensome that business is no longer possible, then a possible solution is to convince other countries to also support the rights of their disabled populations.<p>&quot;often building things speculatively&quot;<p>It really depends on what they are building, does it not? If it&#x27;s the Norwegian equivalent of Amazon, with 150 people working on the project then that&#x27;s different than a group of 4 undergraduates with a bright idea.<p>In the main thread, I pointed out that the actual Norwegian laws has exceptions for when there&#x27;s undue burden. This parallels equivalent ADA exceptions in the US. (In the US: &quot;Employers are not required to provide accommodation where doing so would impose an undue hardship on the business&quot;. In Norway, &quot;There is an exemption from the requirement for universal design, if this causes an &quot;undue burden&quot; for the business, see § 13 subsection.&quot;)<p>Almost certainly small speculative startups will not be subject to this law, if it&#x27;s anything like the ADA. To resolve that will require reading the Norwegian laws directly, which is beyond my powers. (What little I&#x27;ve found says that they are still working on the details.)<p>I&#x27;m hardly calling for a Harrison Bergeron solution. We&#x27;ve had the ADA in the US for 24 years and that hasn&#x27;t hobbled the able. It&#x27;s <i>has</i> required companies and owners to spend money (making money is a huge part of a person&#x27;s life) to redress someone else&#x27;s disabilities. Many people don&#x27;t like the ADA for exactly the reasons you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s still the law.<p>I pointed to successful lawsuits in the US which have established that web sites in the US are subject to the ADA requirements. I pointed to the rule making process which has started to establish what that means. Something equivalent <i>will</i> be happening in the US, either through regulations or piecemeal through lawsuits. Do you want your startup to be surprised by an ADA lawsuit someday? Or would you rather a set of rules where you can figure out when to start with ADA support, once your startup is successful enough?",1396726208

From what I gather, it sounds like in college you&#x27;ll learn more traditional &quot;computer science&quot; stuff, which is great if that&#x27;s not your background. You&#x27;ll learn classical patterns, some stuff about how to construct algorithms, memory management, big O time complexity, data structures, etc.  I had the benefit of learning most of that in high school (they offered C and C++ courses and I had a wonderful teacher), and filled in the gaps by teaching myself (most of that can be learned in a few days if you have access to the internet).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of practical knowledge that you&#x27;ll need if you want to do web development somewhere that requires you to be good at your job. Things like source control (I&#x27;ve never heard of a university that teaches Git), quoting/estimating tasks (something that can only be learned with experience, no way around it), balancing business/tech needs, tooling/workflow optimization, how to choose an appropriate technology stack, and anything on the front-end more advanced than basic CSS, just for starters.<p>In short, college will NOT prepare you for the web industry. Expect to spend at least a year getting up to the level where you can have a development-oriented conversation with a real web developer.  I can&#x27;t speak to the rest of the industry, since my experience is pretty exclusive to the web.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re doing well just learning on your own, and thankfully we work in an industry where universities can&#x27;t hoard all the knowledge: anything they can teach you can be found online. They just offer a structured environment in which to consume that knowledge, for those that need some extra hand-holding (probably because the high school education system is an absolute travesty, but that&#x27;s a rant for another day).<p>One caveat: if your schooling is paid for (scholarship, parents, etc) then by all means take full advantage of the free ride. I was lucky enough to have a fiance that supported me while I spent about 6 months learning everything I needed to gain employment at a web development agency (and now I support her with that job while she&#x27;s going to cosmetology school); I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would have been to learn all that while having to worry about bills.

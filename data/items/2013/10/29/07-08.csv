That goes triple for laptops.<p>I was dragged back to the Windows world with Vista and 7 because it was obviously more efficient with my time.  Last year I purchased a mac mini and it has completely taken over as the machine that I get all of my work done on.  Easily five times more efficiently than any other platform.  My Windows machine does nothing more than store media and play games.  The next computer I buy is going to be an rMBP, I have no doubt.<p>And before someone eventually brings up Ubuntu, it&#x27;s a joke and a toy OS that&#x27;s suitable for hobbyists and old people.

Closing the gap is easily a full day.\nGetting a Linux system up and running properly takes a weekend, taking time to do everything the right way.

E.g. don&#x27;t spend days or weeks to make a part of the program that gets called very rarely run 0.1% faster, when you could instead spend that time on solving a new problem, or making an actually useful optimization, or doing something else entirely.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s silly to bicker about what is &quot;useful&quot; when it comes to things people do to relax or entertain themselves; and usually fruitless when it comes to things they do as escapism or getting a feeling of achievement to compensate for areas where they are stuck or blocked off. I do think the psychology of it is interesting though, and my personal guess is that most if not all people have the innate desire to progress and achieve things, but we often can&#x27;t for some reason or other. Why does a caged animal endlessly walk in circles? Because it&#x27;s better than doing nothing. And before you think I&#x27;m just being snarky, think again, please; I did and do my fair share of such things myself, I just also can&#x27;t help but notice that the smaller and more powerless people become, the more we celebrate rather pointless things - TV and the interwebs are full of that.

Based on very limited experience, travelling to job interviews creates the kind of disorientation where you can&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re looking at is real at a time when people are trying to get to know you.  These forces are countervailing.  Even while getting on the elevator, I was about 10% sure of where I was at in the city and just living on instinct.  This makes travel exhilarating, but for an interview, it makes you want to try to cram in a month&#x27;s worth of the necessary relationship building in one day while half-disbelieving what you are doing.  Still fun, but it also seems that 95% of worthwhile mental activity happens in the combination of sleep and then re-approaching things the next day from new angles.  I had already decided to always plan for extra time.  Unconventional interviews are cool, and definitely necessary for the added responsibility and chemistry requirements, but don&#x27;t let the travel make unconventional into just plain weird.

Getting &#x27;published&#x27; requires getting a compiler to agree to run your code, getting peers willing to work with you, and finding a company which thinks you should be hired (or starting your own). And computer users won&#x27;t accept buggy programs, even though they may accept poor grammar. Also, the industry is perfectly happy to tell programmers exactly what programs to write and pays them well.

I have tried to bring in notice of FB but they wont delete account. Later I tried to do an experiment and created a fake account myself and post malicious pics. Again through my account when I brought this to notice, they won&#x27;t delete it. I figured out how they are siphoning off advertisers money through these [atleast 100 million fake accounts].<p>I appreciate your purpose has a meaning to it and somehow this is a good attempt to bring thing to a logical end by providing it as a service. This scholarship will indeed help a lot of struggling music artists.",1383030110

At least no content which is important enough for people to change, everything is centered around 1080p atm and the majority of people are just adapting this (upgrading their &quot;hd ready&quot; tv, new consoles, switching from dvd to blu ray etc).<p>Also it&#x27;s coming to devices which don&#x27;t have to rely on 3D performance. It is an astronomical hit rendering on such high resolution, because you still need anti-aliasing.",1383030084

I'll just pick out the things that are indisputably wrong, there is more that I would argue is wrong but may be viewed differently by others. You've already mentioned the false information about Mocality that the caller uses, so I don't need to repeat that.<p>""[The domain will be] ww.your business.CO.KE""\nNo, it will be www.your business.kbo.co.ke. This is something very important, you get a subdomain of Google's Kenyan Business Online site kbo.co.ke.<p>""Twenty one days. We’re going to develop the website within\t  twenty one days""\nNo. Google's KBO does not develop the websites themselves, they provide a ""Business Sitebuilder tool"" that allows you to do it yourself.<p>""XXXXX dot XXXXX at gmail dot com.""\nThis should be @google.com not @gmail.com.<p>""and also we go on facebook. People who log into facebook can see the clothes you are selling.""\nNo. Google's KBO does not do anything with Facebook.<p>""When someone is on facebook, they’ll see your ad there.""\nAgain, no. Google is not giving you advertising space on Facebook.<p>""Ok, there’s a small fee for hosting of Ksh. 200 per month. [...] Only that for hosting. You know\thosting\tis\tdifferent from developing.""\nNo, there is no hosting fee. The only possible fee is an optional one if you want your own domain and it isn't 200 per month.<p>There's more but I think that should give you the general idea. Given just this transcript and comparing it to the details of Google's program at kbo.co.ke I would say that this caller is definitely not working for Google but is rather a scammer. In fact, in this transcript the caller basically walks through the steps needed to use the Business Sitebuilder tool. This explains how the business who didn't agree to the thing would end up with a site anyway, the scammer did it while on the phone.\nNow, I haven't considered the IP logs, but my best guess for that is that it is coming from Google Translate as discussed elsewhere.<p>Edit: I should clarify. I am not certain that Google was not involved with this, it's more that I am convinced that that particular caller wasn't working for Google. While I am unconvinced that these callers worked for Google, there is some rather damning evidence.",1326488117

3462356,comment,3461728,3462288,1,0,figglesonrails,,,"Accessors are hardly a pre-generalization. I believe he was simply telling various use-cases that can be applied. Yes, software requirements change and some things don't (in practice), but you won't know precisely what will and won't need them until you ship. And even then, you may not know what will be required years from now. It seems like the rational option is to sink a second or two more time into the development in order to save potentially long and annoying refactors later. I've been using Visual Assist and I can actually get it to dump an accessor into the console faster than I can type out the full variable name (for variables name that aren't i,j,k).<p>On a more serious note, trivial accessors generally don't result in any more compiled code than direct field accesses, but do have the advantage of abstraction. If your development process is limited by the time it takes you type out the name of an accessor (or in my case, the first 3 letters), then you must be really productive or not do other things like documentation or testing.",1326488002

Take away the garbagemen (as the city of Toronto did, for a little while) and observe their impact (or rather, smell).<p>Compare to the innumerable hackers being employed to build, well, a whole lot of nothing, much of which won't ever even see the light of day. Between running out of cash, big-company reorgs, and just plain bad ideas, there's a <i>lot</i> of software being written that simply won't benefit anybody in any significant way.<p>Humanity is reaching an unprecedented amount of specialization - we used to live in societies where the purpose and contribution of a particular person to the whole is easily understood by everyone.

If no official response is received in X days then the DOJ could issue a black listing. However, if the administrator does respond either by complying or by issuing a counter claim then the DOJ could not issue a black listing.

We need more software developers, and this is an untapped pool.  If we increase it a little, we'll have a lot more programmers.<p>I have also noticed behaviors that work to systematically lower participation by women, and I have worked to reverse them.  For example -- noting that invitations to speak at a tech conference included no women, even though there were many qualified choices (I gave the conference organizers a list).  I think the issue was that we invite who we know -- we need to break out of that -- our networks are probably overwhelmingly male.<p>I suggest more discussion (not here -- everywhere) -- but focused on ideas to increase the number of women in programming -- not meta-discussions.  Try to notice when the ratio is bad and comment on it -- insist on something being done.  And --- if you notice behaviors that work against changing the ratio -- do something about it.<p>And, I don't think it's very constructive to keep meta-arguing about it.  If you want to, go ahead, but it's starting to sound a little silly.  Almost all of these arguments were used to stop women from becoming lawyers 100 years ago.

I can't just use the exposed position member of the sprite--it has context and logic behind it that must be done.<p>Oh wait, I have a problem in which the sprite glow might change depending on how many times its been drawn.<p>Version 4: The renderer now has to keep track of how many times it's drawn a sprite.

Someday, you might want to stop storing x, and instead make it a calculated value. At which point you'll need a method. Or, when setting x, you may someday want to increment a counter, or transform the input data, or take some other action. Again, you'll need a method.<p>Yes, it's very easy to add an accessor later. But then you'll most likely have to edit every line of code that accessed the now-defunct member variable. Your IDE may make this easy, but I'd still prefer not to have to do it.<p>That's not to say writing accessors is <i>always</i> the best choice. I'm just saying there <i>can</i> be good reasons to do it. Like all things in software engineering, there's no one-size-fits-all rule about this.

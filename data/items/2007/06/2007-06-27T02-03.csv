Every letter after that only goes into the quick search.  So to write a word I have to click on every single box.  Definitely annoying.  But again, could just be a conflict on my machine.  That's firefox 2.0.0.4 on gentoo linux",1182913016

Your audience may be technical, but that doesn't necessarily mean we don't like colour. Of course, these things are subjective. <p>-  might want to make the screenshot even larger - or zoom into an interesting feature.  Visuals break up the page and draw the eye.<p>+ the quote at the top is good<p>- you say 'the four best ways to manage your server' and then make the user search thru a paragraph of text to figure out what you mean.  Call the 4 ways out with more emphasis..<p>- don't think you need the 'The New Virtualmin.com' section. It's like a sausage maker boasting about improvements to their factory...  Perhaps you could make better use of that space by focusing on the product.
- Use more visuals - perhaps to highlight the top 3 features of your product<p>There are more positives than I have mentioned but calling out what needs to be improved would probably be of more use to you.<p>

30996,comment,30954,30993,0,0,Psyonic,,,"The only problem with that idea is performance.  Javascript the language is not necessarily slow, but almost all modern implementations are.  I suppose the saving grace is that multitasking isn't exactly common on a phone, but even still I can see it being a problem.  What about games, for example?  Anything beyond Sudoku is going to have problems.",1182912697

And I do love them to bits(Although I get lazy coding HTML and CSS every now and then) After reading the entry more deeply I can't help to think this post is about DHH's relunctance to use Flex + Rails technology. <a href=""http://flexiblerails.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flexiblerails.com/</a><p>Granted I love Rails but still use Perl and PHP to code most of my apps, I'm not too keen either to learn Flex at this point in time(depending on my mood anyway).

30993,comment,30954,30978,0,0,palish,,,"From what I can tell, a lot of people are a tad confused by the fact that you have to use Javascript to interface with the iPhone.. A lot might think that it's a crippled interface.  But Apple can expose every single part of the phone to Javascript.  Add in the ability to create an icon on the iPhone that automatically visits a website, and you have, for all intents and purposes, a native application running on the iPhone.  So I'm not sure why people feel that it's a crippled platform.<p>Now, if Apple <i>doesn't</i> expose every single part of the iPhone to Javascript, then that's a little annoying.  But then again, I wouldn't want a random web application to be able to take a picture and upload it whenever it felt like.",1182911326
30992,comment,30950,30950,0,0,staunch,,,"Overall it's extremely nice. Some unfiltered random things that I thought:<p>+ So much text on the front page I didn't read any of it.<p>
+ The favicon ""fit into"" the logo. Trivial, but pleasing.<p>+ The first thing I wanted to see after screenshots was the demo, but I only found that by scrolling to the bottom.<p>+ The demo seems to be on a slow machine or something because it's not very responsive and the UI graphics (rounded corner GIFs) loaded slowly (no keepalives?).<p>+ The quote ""Your software kicks ass!"" seems a <i>little</i> risque for your intended audience. It stood out to me at least.<p>+ ""Docs"" navigation option made me thing of Google Docs & Spreadsheets which through me off.<p>+ Navigation links are a bit non-standard and seem unimportant because of their size.

30989,comment,30776,30813,0,0,brlewis,,,"If you ever took a hundred kid photos and tried to organize them into albums on a non-automatic photo-sharing site, you'd understand why I emphasize ""automatically.""<p>I used to think ""amazing"" was useless marketingspeak until I saw reddit stories succeed or fail based on the word.  Yes, simple is absolutely what I emphasize.  Yes, the purpose is to share photos.  It isn't a social networking site for photography enthusiasts like flickr, etc.; it's a simple way to share photos.<p>I realize I am not a designer.  I'm poor enough at it that I might not recognize good design if I saw it, except in terms of usability.  That aspect of the site will have to wait.  Luckily, people seem to get a positive experience when attention is drawn to content they're interested in, and the current default style accomplishes that.

Skilled artistic photographers are well-served by existing photo-sharing sites.  This one is for photos whose value is in the story they tell.",1182909641

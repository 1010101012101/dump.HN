Legally there was a distinction between a privateer and a pirate, but in practice a lot of crews floated back and forth over the line, shall we say.<p>A book modelling pirates as democratic capitalists <i>avant la lettre</i> ought to say something about the interactions between the internal government of the ship and these external powers, but from the ToC and the review, I can't tell if Leeson actually goes into this.

Here are some examples: <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/customers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/customers/</a> . Of course those customer statements are somewhat biased coming through IBM, but still fairly accurate and realistic.<p>Storing XML as a string is really not very useful since you can't query into the document contents. You also can't create indexes on particular elements or attributes for fast access.<p>Microsoft has a good explanation of why it isn't necessarily appropriate to store XML structures in a conventional RDBMS. I'll quote it here:<p>""The XML data model has characteristics that make it very hard if not practically impossible to map to the relational data model. XML data has a hierarchical structure that may be recursive; relational databases provide weak support for hierarchical data (modeled as foreign key relationships). Document order is an inherent property of XML instances and must be preserved in query results. This is in contrast with relational data, which is unordered; order must be enforced with additional ordering columns. Re-assembling the result during querying is costly for realistic XML schemas that decompose the XML data into a large number of tables.""<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345117(SQL.90).aspx#sql2k5xml_topic2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345117(SQL.90).asp...</a>",1246495966

We, for example, are a reasonably cool place to work at but our paymaster is an Equal Opportunities employer. That means we have to be very very strict about the hiring process and even in situations where we know and have solicited an applicant, s/he <i>still</i> has to be graded according to fair and consistent rules like all other applicants.<p>The original article was correct: an employer typically asks for 6-9 things in a job ad; some will be obvious directly from your resume (eg. ""10 years experience in C""); all others should be dealt with in a cover letter. For example if the employer asks for ""MacOS X experience"" and you haven't got any in your resume, a cover letter that says ""while I do not have much direct experience with MacOS X, I have programmed for many years on similar POSIX compliant environments such as FreeBSD and I am confident I would quickly be productive in the MacOS X environment"".",1246495138

We save you time. (Do no evil?) Google doesn't aim to be a ""distraction"" that ultimately saves you time, they want to save you time period. If they could, they would give you exactly what you wanted each and every time. But their algorithm can't tell when you're browsing for pleasure or looking for something in particular. It can come close, and in the end some people will be distracted by them whereas others will have exactly what they needed.<p>Google wants to make profit in the opportunity costs involved in searching for something. Searching for a product has all sorts of pains associated (analysis paralysis, getting lost, etc etc)... google wants to make profit between this consumer cost and the amount of ineffective money spent to reach consumers.<p>It also seems like you are focusing a lot on banner ads. I think one interesting statistic (sorry can't find a more recent one right now). Is that banner ads are about 20% of ad spend whereas search is 52%. I think Search is a even higher percentage now.

However, a mechanic's ability to diagnose issues based on the subtlest of clues seems fairly close, at least in my experience, to a skilled programmer's ability to track down a quirky bug - both are based almost entirely on their exhaustive knowledge of the underlying system. The medical field's underlying system is biologic rather than mechanical in nature - hence most of the diagnostics have to be based on generic tests that are variably reliable (at least now, prior to surely-forthcoming genomic advances in medicine), rather than solely intuition and experience.",1246494342

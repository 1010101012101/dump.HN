271672,comment,271342,271342,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Wow - great advice. Jason's emails have been awesome so far.<p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't even understand the purpose of using PowerPoint. To me it just screams: ""I'm a suit"". If you have any semblance of a working product, why aren't you spending your time showing it off? Also, when I'm talking I want the audience focused on what I'm saying not the slide animations and colors.<p>I guess I could understand if you don't have any sort of working product or if you just have a few _concisely_ worded slides to reinforce certain points. However, the vast majority of presentations I've seen aren't like that at all.<p>I think of the ~1000 or so Powerpoint presentations I've been exposed to, only a handful have added significant value to what the speaker is saying (the Nike VP of marketing had the best one I've ever seen - surprise).",1218290037

271670,comment,271209,271552,0,0,river_styx,,,"I see two major flaws with this approach. First, it's invasive. You have to open an additional hole in your network to allow traffic into the app, which makes your network inherently less secure. Second, unless you do an audit of the source, there are no guarantees as to the security of the app itself. This app of unknown reliability would be acting as a 24/7 gatekeeper into your network.<p>You could hide it behind VPN, I guess, but that kinda defeats the purpose of secure shell.",1218289960

It was only about $15 to replace it with a Ralink card; Ralink happily provided full tech specs to the BSD devs, and the card works quite well.",1218288483
271663,comment,271437,271437,0,0,ashleyw,,,"Personally, a Macbook Pro. I want a laptop to be fast to boot, reliable and nice to work on. Technically OSX is what does all this, but you asked which laptop you should buy, and you either get a Windows Vista or OSX machine. (not to mention getting a Windows machine and booting some flavor of linux, or creating a hackintosh, if thats what you want to do)<p>Spec wise, I'm running on a Macbook Pro 2006 model with a Core Duo 1.86Ghz processor and 2GB of ram, and I'm doing great. I'm sure one of the latest models with a C2D 2.4GHz CPU would be a bit faster, but I don't do anything too intensive (light photoshop is probably the limit of my number crunching apps). So pretty much anything you buy today (except the ultra-budget machines, of course) will suit you for your needs. Just make sure you have a nice amount of ram! :)",1218288415

Universities that encourage professors to be involved with industry, like Stanford, would help tremendously.<p>Also, doing an end-run around broadband might be an even better strategy.  How about distributing OpenMoko sets and programming environments?<p>Another thing to look at -- see what the US is doing wrong and give India an advantage by not duplicating those mistakes.",1218288106

271650,comment,271361,271410,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Uh, what exactly do you mean by ""precisely head on?""  The particles are aimed only such that you have one stream going through the same region of space as another stream.  They are not taking an individual particle and aiming it marksman-like at another individual particle.<p>Even if this were the case, ever hear of ""Relativity?""  The whole point is that there are no special reference frames.  A particle hitting another oncoming ""head on"" is the same as another hitting a ""stationary"" one.  The point being: there is no distinction between the LHC's particle collisions and cosmic rays colliding with matter around our planet.<p>And as far as ""remote chance"" goes, given the huge number of collisions that already happen with even greater energies, this chance must be about as remote as a droplet of water being thrown spontaneously from a still glass of water to the ceiling.  There is a finite probability, but it's so low, it's practically zero.<p><a href=""http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4109"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4109</a>",1218287182

Me and other Mac users talk a lot about our Macs because a lot of us are just finding out how to do stuff, and if somebody else brings up the stereotype of artsy-fartsy we jump into character... but I haven't seen anybody walking around with this ""I own a Mac"" self-importance. There's a lot of ""Boy am I glad I have a Mac"" mentality, but that's about it.<p>Actually, the most pretentious lad I know uses a Windows because he's too artsy to use something that's accepted by the artistic majority.",1218287133

271644,comment,271628,271628,0,0,swombat,,,"I am naturally skeptical of unknown people asking for details that belong in the business plan. If you're a potential investor, I don't mind sending you the plan, and without an NDA, but for random sites to ask for such details just seems wrong. Moreover, I think that any business owner who gives in to such requests is either desperate or stupid.<p>I applied to thefunded.com at some point, and they asked for those kinds of details too. I'm not quite sure what they offer in return for all this confidential information, and actually, the fact that they ask for it and that their members have all given it kind of rules them out as a community worth belonging to, imho - full of ""entrepreneurs"" who are either desperate or stupid.<p>Would love for someone to contradict me and let me know what I've missed out on by not sending our business plan to be reviewed by unknown parties at thefunded.com.",1218286910

I've coded much better on my Macbook than I ever did using an HP desktop.<p>I wouldn't use that to argue that OS X is necessarily better than other operating systems, but as an individual case to remind you that when you make your OWN case, you're relying not on facts but on arbitrary whims of your own. The rest of us know it: stop pretending like you dictate fact.<p>And, by the way, your entire post reeked of condescension, a tad ironically.",1218286807

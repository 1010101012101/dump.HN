Look at the raw numbers in MLB today: the number of pitchers with an ERA under 3.0 has doubled this years compared to ten years ago, and the power homerun leaders are down about 20 HRs as well.  You&#x27;ve got some technical and strategic changes that might help to account for the ERA improvements, like increasing emphasis on defensive skills at some positions, and massive increases in the usages of aggressive defensive shifts, but the HR numbers are pretty clearly the result of cleaning up steroid usage among hitters.  There&#x27;s been a few ballpark changes that have switched some of the old bandbox parks over to parks with larger outfields, but that&#x27;s not enough to get us from having random third-basemen and shortstops cranking 40-50 HRs to where we are now.",1437285587

I dont know what tomorrow&#x27;s zero-day will look like but the chances are quite good that it will depend on a file that is installed by default.

Its source was about a dozen lines.  That particular file was required but our default installs have many files we dont really need.<p>Also if you can read - not just execute - the binary to any program or library then your malware can load it into its memory then execute it.

9910153,comment,9908755,9908755,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"In the medical practice world, marketing of pharmaceuticals has been an incendiary subject for some time.  The common gist has been that medical practitioners are too easily influenced and merely hearing what a pharma company rep has to say will lead to inappropriate prescribing.<p>On such grounds many clinics forbid manufacturers&#x27; reps to have access to staff, else they would be tainted.  Of course they&#x27;d be, a dozen years of training and 20 years on the front lines mean nothing, really, prescribers are clearly unable to know a sales pitch when they hear it, incapable of applying their own judgement concerning a product&#x27;s merit.<p>Sure, there are instances where pharma firms have been unethical, but in my dealings with them, reps have mostly stayed within the lines.  In case they don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not that delicate and can deal with overzealousness when necessary.  Generally, it&#x27;s a two-way interaction, I listen to what reps have to say, and the better ones listen to my feedback about clinical realities.<p>One thing that gets lost in the noisy public discourse is the role of marketing.  In our economic system marketing is fundamental to distribution of goods and services. A pharma company could develop a break-through product, but if providers don&#x27;t know of its existence it won&#x27;t be used where it would make a difference.<p>Inadequate marketing has impeded uptake of a number of useful medications, and fewer treatment options is not a good thing.  I&#x27;m not advocating a free-for-all in this sphere, rules are necessary.  But we can have too many rules too, better to maintain an intelligent balance.<p>Sometimes I think about an interesting experiment: what if <i>all</i> advertising had to follow the same rules as pharmaceutical companies?

My framework compliments that and reminds that it must be applied to every layer down to the gates.<p>So, although my sharing is limited by paywalls, I hope you find these interesting and can see the different perspectives of highly assured security. There have been numerous successes in independent testing, pen-testing, and field use. Also remember that this is <i>only</i> provable security rather than verification of properties in general.

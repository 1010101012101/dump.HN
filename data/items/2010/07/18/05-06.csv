Any drug that is able to do this to your body will probably decrease your health drastically. If you really do have to work a lot the best way that I have found is to sleep 8 hours and work 16 hours. Unfortunately shower time will probably suffer so use plenty of deodorant. You will also be eating junk food for a couple of weeks but believe me, it is a much better alternative than using drugs.

In a capitalist sense, it's not very successful if they aren't making any money.<p>So how do you define success?  Is Arc successful if you open a web page and then 30 minutes later try to submit a form and get ""unknown link"" or something to that effect.  It seems massively broken to me.<p>I'm not trying to pick on pg. I'm trying to present the alternative which is this: survivor bias.  pg may have been in the right place at the right time with viaweb. As an incubator, pg probably made money on reddit, but conde nast has almost certainly lost money on reddit, so I'm on the fence about that.<p>Continuing on, I think it isn't unsurprising that putting $15k or so into 118 startups over the past 5 years would lead to one or two successes. pg has the benefit of being the magnet, or is it magnate? All the <i>best</i> ideas come to him, but there have only been a small handful of ""massive successes"" turned out. With his social network and contacts, quite frankly, I expect more big successes than I've seen.<p>How successful <i>is</i> pg, really?  Do we know?<p>I suppose, really, my point is this: If there was a science to this, then it should be repeatable. Since it doesn't appear that pg has repeated his viaweb success in over 10 years, I wonder where is the science? Is pg just someone we choose to listen to because it feels good? He makes hackers feel good and important and understood?  He can empathize with us, so we lend him our ear?<p>But are we wasting our time?<p>I love hn, I love listening to pg on stage talk about startups. It's like chicken soup for the startup soul.  But maybe I'm being misled.  Maybe it's just feel good, irrational stuff that isn't practical or beneficial -- and perhaps even harmful.<p>How do we know we won't be listening to him and then 10 years from now, we find out he's lost all his viaweb money. He hasn't been able to keep the startup chuck wagon turning out profitable businesses or something like that and we wasted all this time trying to replicate his success because... well... he writes a lot and it feels good to read it...",1279431246

I'm part of something that's more like a clan than anything else - there are ten members currently and each person's relationship with each of the others is somewhere between friend and full partner, though most of us are partnered to at least two of the rest (and myself and the strongest personality female partner are both partnered to most of the rest as well as each other - I'm currently writing this sat on her flat's deck in PDX).<p>This doesn't prevent any of us having partners outside the group, either, although if I expect to emotionally commit to somebody I try to at least introduce them to the rest since these are the people that I trust with my life and my future.<p>I, personally, seem to have been gifted with a very minimal capacity for jealousy; the other members vary, and it's not really a problem - anything that makes anybody unhappy is taken as something to be understood and resolved by conversation and change. The cross-support possibilities help a lot, especially given that a number of us have fairly high velocity lives and can disappear for days at a time dealing with work (though a number of us are in IT of some form so sometimes we lean on each other for help during crunch times too).<p>All relationship patterns require lots of effort to work well. All relationship patterns involve drama sometimes. The difference in my experience (I've done monogamy, open - i.e. single emotional, multiple sexual partner, multiple-independent-partner poly, and now clan) is what sorts of drama, what sorts of effort, and what sorts of people. Currently the clan approach is my favourite, but then again at any given time the approach I was using was my favourite.<p>I don't generally go out of my way to broadcast my choice of relationship pattern, but I also don't go out of my way to not mention it - to refer to one of my loves as my partner without making the existence of the rest clear seems to me to be disrespectful to the other people that I'm in love with. This hasn't, so far, caused a problem with any client to my knowledge when it's come up in social conversation - but even if it did I'd simply stop discussing my life with the person who found it troublesome, it wouldn't make me any more willing to lie about who I love and why if asked a direct question.<p>I'm not really sure what else I should cover - it's hard to know which things people will find remarkable about your life when you're in the middle of living it. I'll try and monitor replies here though (or I could start a Tell HN in the reddit IAMA style if people preferred)",1279430815

Double click on the project name under ""Groups & Files"" and change the ""Base SDK"" setting from whatever it is (probably 2.x-era) to the latest one that you have installed.<p>// edit: Yup, downloaded one project (WhatsMyIP) to look at and this was exactly the problem/fix. There were other warnings, but those are non-fatal. Or, at least, it still builds. I didn't actually run the app (my iOS device and sim are both busy with other tests right now).",1279429884

The notion that cyberspace was some place you went to waste time was just getting started - Reddit didn't invent it, but they caught the early phases of the wave, and it wasn't at all obvious to everyone.  There were no such things as FaceBook apps in 2005.  FaceBook itself was limited to college students (or it had <i>just</i> expanded to high school students).  There was no Twitter, and no Zynga, and YouTube was <i>just</i> getting started.  Most people hadn't heard of Digg, and sites like StackOverflow or Hacker News were far off in the future.  Casual games were around, but they didn't make headlines the way they do today.<p>Yes, there were people who wasted time online, but they were usually people in niche subcultures like fandom or gaming.  Many of the early Web 2.0 successes still had a significant productivity bent to them, eg. del.icio.us was seen as a way to organize your bookmarks online, Flickr grew a large community of professional or semi-professional photographers, and blogs were often viewed as a way to increase your professional reputation.<p>People love wasting time online <i>now</i>, but that was not a mainstream view when Reddit started, and they are perhaps responsible for some of it.  That's what PG means by pushing against the current.",1279429868

Days went by, delicious went through it revolution/evolution cycles and stationed where it is right now.

That is, If I tweet about a fascinating page, I'd like to able to easily retrieve it 6 months later.<p>that is to say, auto-tweet is nice feature but I am looking for the vice versa (twitter, facebook, buzz, wherever I go and save/mark links).<p>Wish you good luck with your new service.",1279429688

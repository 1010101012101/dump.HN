[1] There are people (some of whom are my friends) who have full-time jobs trying to help people get out! [2] And there are a lot of incentives to leave. Nobody enjoys the homeless-shelter experience.<p>Almost all of the people who are <i>chronic</i> residents of homeless shelters have health problems (often, specifically, mental health problems), are current or former drug addicts, or have spent time in prison.<p>These problems tend to feed on each other. Mentally ill people often manifest erratic behavior that gets them sent to prison. Drug addicts get arrested and sent to prison. Prisons are a great place to be introduced to life as a drug addict, and can exacerbate certain mental illnesses. And sick people often attempt to relieve their own symptoms with drugs (a popular choice: alcohol). The technical term for the latter behavior is ""self-medication"", and it's a classic route by which an otherwise well-off person can get sucked into the poverty spiral.<p>Meanwhile, it also doesn't surprise me that a white, male, healthy, educated person with independent means and an active online life can really enjoy working at Wal-Mart. Slumming can be fun. Every grad student knows that. I'm told by reliable witnesses, however, that actual chronic poverty is an entirely different ball of wax.<p>---<p>[1] Note, of course, that ""escaping a homeless shelter"" is not at all the same thing as ""escaping poverty"". Being homeless is only one of the more desperate forms of poverty. There are many others.<p>[2] One of the key skills for escaping homelessness: The ability to fill out forms. Social workers spend a lot of their time just helping people stay patient while sitting on hold, send in applications, get to appointments on time... It's easy to forget, from our perspective as high-end employees of the knowledge economy, that not all of our fellow humans are born with the requisite knowledge and patience to do these things. And that you and I are exactly one stroke or car accident away from losing those skills.",1233604734

And the market pretty much accepts this.<p>I know I'm not considering all the other business costs here.  But, shouldn't someone be able to ""Wal-Mart"" Starbucks and copy their product but cut the margins to put them out of business?<p>Another example is the people with laptops who are buying $5 tickets in the form of cups of coffee to rent a few hours of de-facto office space.  Are they going to quibble if it's $6?  If the ambiance is a little cooler, or the coffee a little hipper, or the wait-staff a little cuter, an extra dollar might not matter to them, or might not be enough to chase them to the Starbucks across the street.<p>In short, part of the point of going to a coffee shop is to get away from seeing yourself as a ""price taker.""  Otherwise, you can get your caffeine cheaper at McDonalds.<p>Do those of you reading this pass up one coffee shop over another for $1 difference in price?  $0.50?  $0.25?

Diminishing this gap will reduce the ""power"" that 99.9999999999999 percent of real-estate people have leveraged during the last eight years.<p>The only way to reduce this gap is by paying people in the real estate profession less: get them to divulge their pay in dollars, not percents.

There is an oft repeated cliche about playing quarterback in the NFL, that no matter how much you practice or try to simulate game conditions, the speed and chaos of actual game conditions is something you can't understand, really, until you experience it.<p>Well, learning a foreign language does not involve 300 pound men coming at you at high velocity, but the real experience of trying to communicate something you really want to say to a real human being is a very different experience than learning words or even grammar structure from a book, audio, video, or lecture.  Even interacting with classmates is somewhat contrived, because you are probably trying to say something your teacher prepared for you, instead of getting own ideas across.<p>So, to summarize: learning a language with out immersion (or something close to it) will likely never amount to anything more than an academic experience.",1233603751

I guess I conflated financial success and coolness: Mission Creek, one block down Valencia from Ritual, seems to get along just fine but it's a terribly dull place to go. The coffee there is just like anyone else's; the food is mediocre; the atmosphere is deathly silent. They've taken prime real estate and turned it into an office for people with no office -- and not a fun one. It's literally no more social than sitting in your living room, and the coffee and food are on par with what you could make for yourself. And the entire city is full of these decrepit little places that can only afford to offer mediocrity, because better food wouldn't necessarily bring in profits, and cranking up the music might drive away the customers who buy the most product. In the midst of all these mediocrity machines, Ritual and Four Barrel stand out because of what they've done with the same opportunities.<p>Okay, they do have one big real estate advantage: they bought giant spaces with room for a roaster. But is there any other way a cafe could serve something special that still attracts the high-profit foot traffic that turns Ritual and Four Barrel into community centers?

Kudos to the author for choosing to let their piece rest on its argument rather than shock and awe to rile up a group of people.<p>However, there is one thing lacking: how we should pay for it.  Should urbanites subsidize internet for the rural?  Should rural folk subsidize rent for urbanites?  More importantly, what is broadband?  Does 768k DSL count?  It's definitely way above dial-up.<p>Part of it isn't even a last mile issue.  Part of it is that many people don't live within 100 miles of an internet backbone.  It's physically impossible to get that far from a backbone in places like South Korea or Japan and a lot of Western Eruope.  It means that you have to draw fiber a lot further in terms of distance and that costs a lot more.<p>That's partly why I think wireless will be the savior here.  It isn't as fast as hard lines, but it can cover big distances (especially fixed wireless where you have a stable antenna on your roof which is what you can install for homes) and current technology could probably provide 1.5Mbps to rural areas today with increases coming at a decent clip.  It's no 20Mbps cable modem, but it will allow them to use VoIP, video, etc.  And it would be a lot cheaper than running so much fiber to rural areas.<p>I have a love/hate relationship with ""great projects"" and I think the internet is a wonderful thing and would love to see more have access to it, but I don't think rural areas can see parity.  Likewise, I think we can work to close the gap.  If we moved the USF (<a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/</a>) to focus on broadband we could get the ball rolling and it's something that already exists for a similar purpose.  Give the telecoms a little incentive to push 3G into more rural areas and offer fixed wireless (basically, the same as a data card only with a nice antenna since it's fixed).  Verizon Wireless is already pushing into areas unserved by DSL and the like with EV-DO.<p>It's tough, but I think that wireless, especially with LTE, HSPA+, and WiMAX in the very near future (Verizon has said they're going to have LTE in a few cities within a year and AT&T is going to be aggressive about HSPA+) is going to allow us to light up the rural areas in a way that allows them to participate in the online community nicely.",1233603396

His problems sets are good too since they are hard enough to be challenging yet its not completely impossible to solve them. However, the course is a little heavy on SVMs ( like.. 5 lectures on them? ) and also leaves out some of the more interesting topics in Machine learning such as graphical models, bayesian nets..etc. But, I'm really glad that they made this course available since there isn't an equivalent undergraduate course in machine learning at my school.",1233602835

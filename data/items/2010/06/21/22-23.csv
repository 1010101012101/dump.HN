1450361,comment,1449823,1449823,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Solve your personal problems first. You're lonely and afraid of people, but you clearly want to NOT be lonely or afraid of people.<p>That will make you miserable no matter what your work is, or whether you go back to school. Those issues are scratching the surface, but you're going to feel inadequate professionally as long as you feel inadequate personally.<p>FTR: ""Shy"" is not who you are, it's how you act. And ""introverted"" only describes the state that helps you ""recharge your batteries,"" not whether or not you understand people and how to act with them.<p>I used to have pretty strong phobia of social situations, would never go to parties if I didn't already know everyone there, etc., and now everybod thinks I'm a fucking butterfly, so believe me -- you can change. And that made a huge difference in my life, deciding that I would conquer it, and doing it -- I made true, deep friends for the first time in my life and my life improved dramatically in every way.<p>For starters, if you're scared, force yourself to go to social situations you'd normally steer clear of. Go to a party. Say hi to two people. Try to make small talk. After 2 people, give yourself permission to stop trying. Next time, make it 4 people. Do something against your nature, like wearing a really loud outfit or bringing food and asking everyone if they tried it. I dyed my hair green. Forcing yourself to try the opposite of what you normally do - show off instead of hide - is extremely illuminating.<p>None of this will actually hurt you, so don't let your fear win.<p>Read The Hard Truth about Soft Skills along with How to Win Friends. They're good.<p>Good luck.",1277161110

Honestly, is there anything about the K-combinator that would naturally make you think ""Hey, that's a K"" if you only knew how it was used and didn't know its name? The name is not the thing.<p>This isn't about a distain for science or knowledge. It's about disdain for oblique names. I mean, heck, we would blast anyone who named all their variables that way. Imagine if Ruby's ""each,"" ""map"" and ""select"" methods were instead named ""w"", ""q"" and ""x"" — you would rightly say that Matz had gone mad.

I'm healthier than I have been in a long time, and doing this, I started slowly losing weight, but the big difference came when I cut out processed sugars and lowered my carbohydrate intake. It's not a super-low low-carb extreme diet, but it's definitely a lot lower than it was.<p>I felt even better, more energy, more weight loss (about 3x faster than I was before), headaches went away, and I started sleeping better.<p>Once I got used to not having all the sugar and carbs, my body stopped craving it.

This is pretty much all copy-pasted from Gary Taubes' ideas, so please don't accuse me of plagiarism!. [Notes, from <a href=""http://higher-thought.net/complete-notes-to-good-calories-bad-calories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://higher-thought.net/complete-notes-to-good-calories-ba...</a> Really really great resource, everyone should read it if they haven't read Good Calories, Bad Calories]<p>1.) This guy is saying that the<p><pre><code>    Delta Fat Stores = Energy In-Energy Out\n</code></pre>\nWell, which is the cause and which is the effect? Isn't it possible that when     Energy Out     changes, so does      Energy In? And, if that's not the case, why don't kids grow obese when they start eating as if they're bodybuilders? The kids eat a lot because they're growing; they're not growing because they're eating a lot. A hormonal drive increases appetite. Pregnant women also grow fatter because of hormones.<p>2.) Folks say that even an extra 100 calories per day will make you get fat over a year. Bogus; the variables     Energy In    and    Energy Out     are dependent. As     Energy In     changes,     so does Energy Out. Also, have you ever had a really, really indulgent meal? I mean, over a fat-pound's worth of calories. You didn't wake up with an extra pound of fat, though.<p>Based on these, it shows that trying to lose weight by adjusting the quantity of calories is pretty counter-productive.<p>Let's look at some people who intentionally try to fatten themselves. Massa tribe males eat an extra 1000 calories worth of milk and sugarcane. Japanese Sumo wrestlers eat a high carb, very low fat diet. Maybe it's the type of calorie that matters more than the quantity. The diets used to fatten farm animals are also high in carbs. Hmm, coincidence? Obese people tend to eat the same amount of calories, but a greater proportion of carbs. Another thing about high carb diets is that they're the only way humans get deficiency diseases; they happen usually when glucose gets crowded in a cell so it takes more of it to even be used in a cell. Deficiency diseases are usually carbohydrate wastage diseases.<p>(Hint: if you want to skip some boring sciency stuff, just read the last paragraph)<p>Hunger, satiety, and physical activity are physiologically regulated (not psychological). Imagine if people started attributing the hunger in diabetics as a psychological problem!<p>Most people think of fat as an inert storage medium; ""like a garbage can.” Nope; fat tissue is dynamic and really kind of like a coin purse rather than a long-term savings account. Fattening is when the rate at which fat is deposited exceeds the rate it is mobilized (getting richer). Fat is controlled by hormones in the body, not by quantity of fatty acids in the blood. When fasting, fat provides 85% of energy and protein is converted to glucose (via gluconeogenesis) for the rest. Likewise, the presence of glucose or insulin (the only hormone behind storing fat) removes fatty acids from circulation; cells burn glucose first, fat second (e.g. having a credit card is more convenient than using cash).<p>The fat stored in adipose tissue is called a triglyceride (3 fatty acids on a glycerol backbone). Some trigs come from fat, the rest from carbs. Fat can only go past the cell membrane in the form of free fatty acids - trigs are too large and must be broken down first. In fat cells, trigs are continuously broken down into FFAs and  recomposed into trigs. Fatty acids not immediately recomposed are sent into the bloodstream as fuel. The rest of FFAs are converted into trigs and loaded on VLDL (read: the super bad cholesterol) and shipped back to fat cells. Simple control mechanism: blood sugar. Glycerol phosphate is the result of burning glucose, and also happens to be the backbone of triglycerides. The rate of trig formation (fat deposition) depends on the availability of glyerol phosphate. So carbs = glucose = glycerol phosphate = trigs = fattening.<p>So hormones control the control mechanisms. Insulin stimulates transport of glucose to fat cells, thus controlling trig formation and fatness. Every single other hormone mobilize fat, but they can only do so if insulin is low. Virtually anything that increases insulin will decrease other hormones.<p>You heard of fructose? It gets turned into glycerol phosphate much more efficiently than glucose. It's the most fattening carbohydrate. Couple this with the fact that table sugar (sucrose) is one molecule of glucose with one of fructose, it's more than their sum since now glucose is increasing insulin with the higher triglycerides from fructose. Even worse? High Fructose Corn Syrup.<p>What I'm trying to say is that the only thing you should be monitoring when you're trying to lose weight is carbohydrates. Eat as much protein and fat (eat a whole stick of butter if you'd like) as you want. Avoid sugar and other carbohydrates. It's safe. Read the book Good Calories Bad Calories (or just the notes, which I pretty much copy-pasted: <a href=""http://higher-thought.net/complete-notes-to-good-calories-bad-calories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://higher-thought.net/complete-notes-to-good-calories-ba...</a>) for more info.

The black hole is moving, but the mass it ate is not. So rather than free falling, it looses momentum. As it falls through the earth it keeps doing that.<p>So it will not rebound back up to the top at the same height it fell. It will be lower. The second time through the same thing will happen.<p>Each time it oscillates it will get lower and lower.<p>Next. Say the black hole is a bit bigger. And it eats some mass on one side of the earth - now there is an imbalance. There is more mass on the other side. So the forces will cause it to slow down more than it otherwise would.<p>When it finally settles down enough to make a cave, it will ""swing"" as much as it can.

It's quite well documented that the best thing you can do for happiness is to improve your personal relationships.  As for money, it doesn't lead to happiness.  A lack of money leads to unhappiness, but you only need enough.<p>Anyway, I really think you're missing my points entirely.  I'm not saying you shouldn't seek self improvement, and I'm not saying you shouldn't try to achieve things (which may or may not lead to riches).  I'm saying do what you want to do <i>for yourself</i> and focus on your relationships.  Don't be led around by false ideals implanted in your psyche, and don't try to be ""good enough"" for others, as it will only make you unhappy.",1277157735

Why do I have to disprove conjecture which is not generally proven as a net benefit? Proponents of this dogma are the ones who want to justify IP regimes, and not only that they (i.e. you) insist this is the way to progress. You've got to prove that the inequalities created are better than the inequalities averted. That basic first step (proof of net positive) has not been done. I am not suggesting action (i.e. IP enforcement), I am suggesting inaction. As in, don't fuck with people unless your theory is proven.<p>Of course, it's worth pointing out that whole line is thinking is utilitarian. Are you truly utilitarian? I doubt it.

The best way to use this to power cars would be to use it to create a fuel with a high energy density.""<p>That is incorrect. If the fusion source is compact, and can produce a lot of instantaneous electrical power, and is quick to throttle up and down, then a ""Back to the Future""-style Mr. Fusion would be the best way to power cars.<p>Energy density isn't the only factor. There's also a question of infrastructure. Electrical distribution has few moving parts, while extracting C02 from the atmosphere to make fuel and distributing the fuel has many more mechanical parts. A fusion plant which could produce 50 kW,  weighed 2 tons, and could be installed in the back yard of a home would mean that a house could be off the grid and still have power left over to charge the car, while using intermediate hydrocarbon storage would mean trips to fill the car, or heating oil, or cooking gas.<p>So while I completely agree that airplanes will not be powered by batteries, I don't think that energy density is the only factor to consider in the economics equation.",1348909196
4589116,comment,4588938,4588938,12,0,jff,,,"I'm continually amused by the space battles in Star Trek. Two ships pull up within a few ship-lengths of each other, then lob torpedoes and phaser beams at each other. I seem to remember seeing in the old series something about how the phasers really get fired: Kirk gives the order, the weapons guy on the bridge presses a button, a buzzer or something sounds down in the ""phaser room"", and a guy down there presses yet another button which does the actual shooting. Similarly for torpedoes, except I seem to remember seeing them manually loading torpedoes into the tubes like it's a 1940s U-boat or something.<p>Vernor Vinge's ""Marooned in Realtime"" has some very interesting space battles, based around the single conceit of ""bobbles"": impenetrable force shields which essentially separate their contents from the universe (and from time) for a pre-selected length of time. Space battles then become a tricky game of trying to catch your opponent when he's un-bobbled, while at the same time avoiding the bobbled nukes and other weapons he has strewn around when you were last bobbled.",1348908916

4589114,comment,4588563,4588563,2,0,anonymouz,,,"""Making parallel computing easy to use has been described as ""a problem as hard as any that computer science has faced"". With such a big challenge ahead, we need to make sure that every programmer has access to cheap and open parallel hardware and development tools.""<p>But the real challenge is in parallelizing the algorithms, reducing data dependencies, and so on. I can get my feet wet with parallel processing on a multi-core PC just fine; making a program run efficiently in parallel is an entirely different challenge, and I don't see how this platform can help me do that.",1348908762

4589104,comment,4586943,4587602,1,0,mun2mun,,,"I can give one example of shared folder madness. When Palm announced new WebOS SDK beta 2.5 years ago, they distributed the sdk via dropbox shared folder among the beta users. The sdk was whooping 500+ MB of size(Linux, Windows, OSX installers were added). Among those users there were some users having free 2GB account. As sdk size were added to their quota, some of them regularly deleted the sdk folder to save space. As the folder was shared, it was also removed for other beta users. Palm regularly had to regularly had to add the folder again. Hilarity ensued :) They even had to put some dummy text file naming ""PLEASE DON'T DELETE THESE FILES'.",1348908068

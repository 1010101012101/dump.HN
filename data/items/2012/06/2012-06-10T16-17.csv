4091512,comment,4090870,4090870,1,0,Jun8,,,"As always, many of Feynman's points are spot on. Yet, why do I get a sense of unease after reading this piece? I think his description of the scientific process is right, but its a bit too simplistic (of course, he was giving a address, not a lecture, but still). Specifically,<p>1. Very cleverly, he mixes in examples of absolute crackpottery (e.g Uri Geller, reflexology) with those of somewhat researchers (e.g. the psychology student) who may be somewhat clueless in their experimental procedures but are trying to do valid science, which in our minds equate both.<p>2. He seems to say: ""<i>This</i> is the way to proceed scientifically, you can't do it another way"", where the methods he alludes to are the methods of experimental physics. (simply put) In physics you do your experiment, carefully controlling factors and you get your result. Unfortunately, this method is either hard to apply (e.g. in the rat experiment, there are so many variables to control, some unknown, because it's a complex organism, now think of experiments on humans) or downright impossible (e.g. the educational problem he mentions, which is a good example of a Wicked Problem, we're still discussing solutions).<p>3. Expanding on the education system point: Feynman says: "" A teacher who has some good idea of how to
teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it some other way--or is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her method is not necessarily a good one."" But therein lies the big problem: <i>nobody</i> can agree on how to measure how good a system, observe the huge teachers's ratings debates taking place in the US. What Feynman misses, I think, is that these are socio-scientific problems, if scientific problems have O(n^2) complexity these have O(2^n). You definitely need the scientific method but that's not going to be enough in attacking these problems.<p>4. Feynman also directs his assault solely on the ""experts"" and charlatans who create and perpetuate these stupid pesudoscientific theories, e.g. ""ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience."" What would be a better way to eradicate such tendencies would be to study why human beings are so susceptible to ideas like religion, UFOs, superstition, etc., i.e. target the consumers rather than dealers.<p>Of course, Feynman was a genius in Physics, in his intuitive grasp of complex physical concepts he may be the best in history. And from what I've ready about him he seemed to have a weak spot (like Newton's alchemy, Einsteins's reluctance to accept QM, etc.) for showmanship, by which I mean: when he got the momentum going with a good example/though/principle that has applications outside physics he was a bit too quick to overgeneralize.",1339347183

4091510,comment,4090710,4091490,4,0,tptacek,,,"The salt in PBKDF2 used as a KDF does almost exactly the same thing as the salt in a password hash: it prevents attackers from precomputing a huge dictionary of candidate password-key mappings and employing it on every PBKDF-keyed system the attacker finds. All secure password-handling schemes are randomized.<p>I don't know what you mean by ""lengthy secret key"", but if you're talking about a string that a human would recognize as language, that's not a strong key. Strong keys come from /dev/keygeneration --- er, I mean, /dev/random and from schemes like PBKDF2.<p>The attack on a human-intelligible crypto key occurs <i>offline</i>, and HMAC verifying keys are usually long-lived, so the attacker has both a lot of time and a lot of incentive to go after that key. Do not use human-intelligible strings as HMAC keys.<p>I've heard a lot of smart people worry about adaptive password hashes becoming a DOS vector for their application, and while stipulating that they are indeed smart people, they haven't thought this problem through very well. Every application can be DOS'd, usually in <i>much</i> more effective ways than by forcing the server to hash lots of passwords. Availability attack vectors in web apps are so common that they aren't even objectives on penetration tests; what would be the point?<p>Also, HMAC ""authenticates"" and ""verifies"" messages; it doesn't ""sign"" them.

4091501,comment,4090298,4091458,2,0,irahul,,,"> Oh yes, part of the real-world where concurrency (via threads) is the core of the system, not some niche sub-technology like 'slow templating PHP engine'.<p>Your claim was ""you can't go far without threads in real world programming"" which is now ""real world programming where concurrency is the core of the system"". Does it need to be said that you won't go far without concurrency in a system which needs concurrency? Isn't that a tautology?<p>And I wasn't referring to PHP. I was referring to Jinja2. Jinja2 is neither slow nor simple, but that's tangential. What if it's slow? Adding threads will do shit as far as rendering templates is concerned.<p>> Now we are not talking about events vs threads,<p>I don't care about events vs threads. I care about throughput(parallelism - make 5 dns requests in shortest span of time) or co-ordinating processes(spell checker thread while I type). Processes, threads, events are all implementation details.<p>> I still can't understand why someone should be stopping from starting a thread in any point of code, front-end or back-end.<p>So you are twitter. I post a tweet. I have 1500 followers. Your cute little java process spawns 1500 threads to update the timeline for my 1500 followers, and I am waiting at my browser watching the loading git. How about 15000 followers? 150000?<p>A controllers job is to return ASAP. Spawn threads all you want. Nobody is stopping you. I was talking about why you don't want that.<p>> If your language of choice is bad at threads (and threads are hard to implement, hard to use, hard to debug, we know that) then you are lucky you can use something else to hack your way out.<p>For the second time, I don't care about threads. Processes, threads, events, agents, transactions with STM - whatever it is doesn't matter  as long as I can get the job done.<p>> But to push it as a normal standard way of doing things... what for?<p>I am not pushing it as normal standard of doing things. For the tasks I generally write, threads won't cut it(Java or no java). Take 1000 threads on a 4 core machine - we will have (memory per thread) * 1000 ram usage, 1000 threads contending for execution on 4 cores. Threads work fine for small values of n, and even for small values for n, threads itself come with a lot of baggage and extra care has to be taken to ensure correctness.<p>> It also has 'event' frameworks for those who really need it for some very specific use-cases like networking (netty, grizzly,something from apache, etc ).<p>You are responding to claims I didn't make. I didn't say Java is bad at concurrency or Java doesn't have evented frameworks.",1339346764
4091500,comment,4087303,4091072,2,0,dkarl,,,"It may be not so much ""well-known"" as universally observed without thinking about it.  I made the same mistake id did, using SDL in fact, spawning a separate  thread for SDL calls.  I beat my head against it for much longer than necessary and finally ended up in the SDL irc channel, where someone firmly informed me to stop making calls from multiple threads.  When I told them I was making <i>all</i> SDL calls from my rendering thread, including SDL_Init, as advised by the documentation, their response was basically that nobody else had ever had this crazy idea before, every game does rendering and UI interaction from the main thread (never mind that I wasn't writing a game and had no user interaction,) and I shouldn't go around trying weird complex stuff until I learned the basics.<p>They didn't argue that the restriction was obvious or well-known, only that it didn't need to be documented because good programmers never thought of violating it.  (I feel more than a little vindicated with Carmack in my corner :-) )  Strangely enough, they also implied that it might be fixed in the future, and now the SDL docs imply that what I did would work [1], though I wouldn't bet on it because they have a FAQ item that seems to say otherwise [2].<p>It's something for people to keep in mind when they're writing documentation:  document the limitations of your software even if you can't imagine why someone would violate them.  People coming from a different background, such as a non-game programmer picking up a game library for some simple animation, might approach your software with different assumptions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/Multi-threaded_Programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/Multi-threaded_Program...</a>

4091490,comment,4090710,4091451,3,0,the_mitsuhiko,,,"> The parent comment doesn't suggest using a PBKDF2-type construction to verify packets, but instead only to generate the secret key used by HMAC-SHA1. That's a one-time operation.<p>I am officially an idiot now.  I see where the original comment is going with.  Namely the ""salt"" part of the library, not the verification of the signature.  You can just use a different secret key or derive one yourself.<p>I sincerely apologize for missing that and the comments that resulted from that.<p>That said: the secret key is the important part there, not the salt.  The salt is just used to alter the secret key that the use of the serializer in two different places for different purposes does not create the same signature.  The intended usage of the whole thing is to not use the salt at all but to provide different secret keys.  The ""salt"" part was taken from the original django implementation with the idea to stay mostly compatible with their format.<p>Could that be improved by switching to PBKDF2?  Probably, but breaking a lengthy secret key is an impossible operation currently, even with SHA1.<p>> Also, PBKDF2 has nothing whatsoever to do with rate limiting login attempts.<p>That's not what I meant.  I meant that PBKDF2 on a server is feasible because you <i>can</i> rate limit the endpoint.  I don't want my servers to be on 100% CPU because someone spams the login form.",1339346434

And I don't believe that people will easily be able to crack that even with the minimal randomness that has been put in with current techniques.

4091445,comment,4091133,4091235,53,0,dkokelley,,,"Well, calculating the ""true"" strength is difficult to do, because even though sophisticated tools are available to aid the process, the attackers are still human, and can input their own guesses that may or may not be more accurate. If the attacker knows (or can closely guess) the password rules used to generate your password, he or she has a better chance of getting a hit.<p>Let's look at a password like ""My first car was a 1972 Monte Carlo"". The password is 35 chars, 3 upper case, 6 special (spaces), and 4 numbers. The key space is all upper and lowercase english letters, all numbers, and all special characters. That's a key space of 95 characters, over 35 places. Objectively, there are 1.66 x 10^69 possible combinations. Given that the LinkedIn password crackers are slowed down at about 9 chars it seems like you're incredibly secure. But let's assume the attacker knows something about your password structure. Let's say they know that you use words (many people do, so it's a reasonable guess). Let's also assume that for numbers the attacker knows that years are popular for password numbers. Now instead of 35 chars, your password has 7 words and a date. We've changed the key space from 95 to about 100,000. (The exact number of words there are is a tricky number to pin down, but crackers have some good data on what the most popular ones are.) As for the date, there are really only a couple hundred interesting numbers, including all dates from this and last century, as well as common patterns.<p>Password strength is (key depth) ^ (key length). An uninformed attacker has 1.66 x 10^69 possible combinations (95^35), while an informed attacker has roughly 1.0 x 10^40 possible combinations (100,000^8). Obviously, the less an attacker knows (or can guess) about your password structure, the better chances your password has against being cracked.<p>Now, you asked about your password versus a random 8 char password. Let's take a ""strong"" password like ""1~qQ%57h"" This password also has upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. We can assume that there is nothing predictable about this password for this exercise. The password strength is 95^8, or 6.6 x 10^15, obviously much lower than the longer sentence, even if the attacker knows the sentence is 7 words and a date.<p>Now remember, our passwords are being matched against human crackers attempting to guess the ways our passwords are most likely put together. For now, most passwords are 6-12 characters. In fact, most websites only allow passwords of these kinds, so it makes the most sense for crackers to go after these passwords. But it's still an arms race. If we assume that webmasters see the light and allow (or enforce) long, sentence-like passwords, the crackers will adjust. It's plausible I think that 5-10 years from now, we'll see articles like this one that use sentence structure syntax as an attack method.<p>Until we discover and implement a better system that obsoletes passwords, the best we can really do is have long, complex, and unique passwords for everywhere we go, and have a system to manage them for us. I believe that something like LastPass or KeePass are the way to go for now.<p>*Disclaimer: This was written on a groggy Sunday morning. Do not rely on my calculations. Do not use any of the examples as passwords. Do please check my work.",1339345564

The more flexible indirect ones involve either providing a TLS config [2] or using the crypto/tls package to create a TLS listener [3].  It comes down to which abstraction level works for your configuration.<p>Due to Go's pervasive use of io.Writer / io.Reader / net.Conn interfaces, once you have the problem of loading keys sorted, everything else is the same as writing a plain old TCP/IP listener.    Configuring TLS will always be a pain -- decades, committees and broken implementations have seen to that.<p>As for actually verifying passwords and session integrity, Go's crypto packages are also pretty straightforwards and composable.  The crypto/hmac [4] package is easily combined with various implementations of hash.Hash.  In exchange for this simplicity, though, Go gives you plenty of opportunity to emulate LinkedIn and blow your own foot off, forgetting salt and common sense.  There are plenty of higher level packages that offer to do it for you.

We don't need more. Maybe we need regulation on how they have to be spread out, but we certainly do not need more. Also, compared to other US cities, cabs here are very reasonably priced. Also, they all take credit cards, have touch screens, and the new ones have outlets to charge your electronics.<p>It may be a bit corrupt, but it really is a good system for the consumer. And it's all completely standardized across the board. Your cab has to be up to code or it gets taken off the street.<p>This isn't corruption running wild. The Taxi system in NYC is very functional. None of the problems described in the article are solved by simply abolishing the medallion system. It would take intense regulation, with or without medallions, to make a lot of those things better.<p>Edit:
What we really need to focus on is the MTA. Now theres a system rife with corruption and misspending that actually greatly effects consumers negatively.",1339344805

In my limited experience with OpenCL programming, the most difficult thing is understanding how memory access patterns affect performance.  It's not made easier by the fact that it may be different on different platforms.<p>I wonder if what's needed is a higher-level representation that can compile to the best access patterns for the given hardware.  (And something that can try several access patterns for your problem and choose the most efficient one.)  GPU programming is still quite new, so I guess it's bound to show up eventually.<p>If it can't handle <i>all</i> possible situations, such a tool would be still be useful, even if you end up having to go down to the CUDA/OpenCL level for certain problems that are too difficult to express declaratively.",1339344580

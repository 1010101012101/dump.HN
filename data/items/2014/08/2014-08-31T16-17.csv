8249736,comment,8249462,8249653,2,0,hga,,,"As a former M1 Garand owner (replaced it with a lighter weapon due to my RSI weakened arms), your link is to my knowledge correct.  While I avoided the screw cases where the bolt was not properly locked back, I can attest to other examples, most especially loading a clip finishing with loading the top round.  The cartridge is indeed where your thumb otherwise would be, your thumb is essentially pushed out the way, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s very hard to get hurt doing this.  Or look at it this way, it would have been <i>very</i> sub-par to have a real problem there when soldiers were loading clips while their minds were preoccupied with combat, and back then in the &#x27;30s the Army really really cared about the quality of our small arms.<p>The #1 screw case I knew about pertained to closing the bolt without loading the rifle, there is danger since it requires reaching past the bolt down to the follower that is locking it back.  The trick is to hold your right hand in a rigid way so that while your thumb is depressing the follower, the bottom of your hand is holding the operating rod handle, keeping the bolt from flying forward.  Depress the follower, then lift your entire hand as a unit up and out.  Works like a charm.<p>Overall I rate the Garand as having better ergonomics than our following two service rifles, the M14 and M16/M4, it&#x27;s for example very smooth in profile, very little to get caught while you&#x27;re carrying it (that insight from someone who used it in Korea).  If I had one today, and only that rifle, I would not consider myself to be under-equipped.<p>Hmmm, one other screw case it has in common with all weapons with the common pattern of an operating handle that is linked to the bolt, i.e. reciprocates with it, is that if you have a hang-fire---you press the trigger and the weapon goes click, but unlike the Java example ^_^ there is a round in the chamber---you&#x27;d best pull the handle back with your smaller fingers, palm upwards and under the bolt.  Because if the round fires while you&#x27;re doing this, if your palm is reversed and you&#x27;re using your forefinger and on without taking precautions, the handle will smash into your thumb or the web of you hand between it and your palm.  That&#x27;ll do some serious damage....<p>C is not quite as good as the Garand is, although I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d use as an alternative.",1409504042

For instance, if you build a reducer, you&#x27;re basically adjoining a &quot;reducible&quot; and a &quot;reduction function&quot; and then transforming the reducer by transforming that reduction function.<p>This already avoids the creation of intermediate structure since you just keep transforming the reduction function, but you have this sort of useless &quot;reducible&quot; thing attached. Mostly, the trouble is that you were afflicted by the kingdom of nouns---you don&#x27;t really need a structure to think of first class objects.<p>Instead, you can just consider the various ways of transforming reduction functions. They all compose as (reverse) functions (you can see them as a category) and you can take your resultant &quot;transducer&quot; and apply it to a source and sink structure to map out of the source and into the sink.",1409503986

8249728,comment,8248864,8249110,7,0,nikcub,,,"> My advice is do not bother.<p>Second this motion. The number of vendors or administrators who respond well to security or privacy reports is tiny.<p>Some approximate data from my own emails. I&#x27;ve reported just over 120 security or privacy bugs over the past 4-5 years that this email address goes back (using my real name). I tag the emails, but searching &quot;from:me vulnerability&quot; brings them up. It is like a scoreboard of horrible vendors and site administrators.<p>From the most recent 100, there are around 25 with no reply at all. I know that some of those, such as government sites were followed up on the phone. Of those with a &quot;(1)&quot; in the thread meaning an additional message, most are me sending a reminder or trying to work out who to contact.<p>There are then a group of replies where they confirm receipt of the email, but then never confirm the actual contents of what i&#x27;ve reported. Scanning the threads, this looks like another 30 or so emails.<p>Then there is the group who confirm or deny the bug or parts but get into prolonged technical arguments, with around a dozen threads stretching beyond 10+ emails into arguments about if it is a bug or not.<p>Last group is those who get the bugs fixed and respond well. In these cases there are only a very small number where the threads are short - most involve long conversations. Some of these are still open - I just reminded myself that I have an open privacy issue with a large web company that still hasn&#x27;t been fixed. That thread is 30+ emails long.<p>Overall more than half either didn&#x27;t reply or didn&#x27;t confirm the bug (silently fixed or not). There is a messy middle full of long threads and replies that are full of frustration and then only a tiny number of reports where they just get fixed with minimal effort (and you know who these companies are).<p>There is not a single instance of a non-software company responding well to a bug report (usually from a custom web app), and that includes some well known brands (banks, etc.). The number of good experiences I could count on one hand.<p>In terms of vendors, recent examples are a 20+ email thread over 3 weeks debating a vendor about severity of a group of bugs (still ongoing), two reasonably well-known vendors with no reply and a well-known vendor who only fixed after more than a month.<p>You can work out before reporting an issue who the good vendors are. They have a page dedicated to security with contact info, a key and a proper reporting program (preferably with a bounty). With everyone else, you are working for free, wasting your time, not making the internet any more secure and run the risk of getting into trouble - in some countries that could involve legal trouble (there have been a number of raids as a result of security reports in Australia, and the government head of privacy here said there is no such things as a white hat report).",1409503852

Someone who doesn&#x27;t learn that skill hasn&#x27;t really learnt to do research.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that a student shouldn&#x27;t spend time talking with their advisor about choice of problem.  Of course they should -- they should talk to as many people as possible!  But the responsibility for the choice of problem should be theirs.  If that&#x27;s not the case, then they&#x27;re missing much of what it is to do research.<p>To quote a letter of Feynman to a former student of his ( <a href=""http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/pr...</a> )<p>&quot;I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert Hibbs) [who worked on] how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant or important to work on...&quot;<p>[1] This is actually pretty complicated.  Many students don&#x27;t have ideas they&#x27;re confident pursuing.  Some don&#x27;t grow into it, even after gaining some experience solving research problems.   That presents challenges.  And sometimes students badly misjudge what is important or interesting to work on.  Should a supervisor interfere when that&#x27;s happening?  It depends.  Making mistakes in choosing which problem to work on is an important part of learning to do research.  So some floundering around is fine.  But allowing it to go on for years and years is just cruel.",1409502932

Also, even if it is formally difficult to change supervisor, in fact if a student decides to work more with another professor for any reason, the original supervisor does not usually raise any practical problem.<p>However, a big problem that I have experienced and seen is that PhDs negatively impact the quality of teaching. Master programs in the NL aim at being very high level (often succeeding), offering also courses on specific advanced subjects. Usually, PhDs have no control over what they will teach, they are simply allocated as &quot;resources&quot; by the faculty, even just to cover a minor part of a course or to supervise/correct practical assignments. This leads to ridiculous situations with courses that, for example, teach advanced rendering techniques but for supervising the practical part allocate a PhD candidate that has clearly never ever rendered a triangle on a screen in his/her life, and who had no time to properly prepare beforehand. I think this is a visible &quot;weak point&quot; of the whole system, and it should be addressed, somehow, also because I have noticed it being treated as some kind of &quot;taboo argument&quot; in the past.",1409502642

Each product has its own branding and different twist but the most common themes seem to be (1)&quot;not breaking the chain&quot; (2) precommitments/accountability/public shaming (3)positive feedback of some sort - positive messages or gamification.<p>This is not a bad set of methods - there is some (varying) evidence to suggest that each of these is effective in improving habit adherence. However, there are loads more facts about habits that don&#x27;t necessarily fit into this paradigm so neatly:<p>- Automaticity does not start to level of for a routine until at least a minimum of 20 days for quite a simple task, and it can be many times longer for more effortful tasks (like doing a daily workout). Average was 60 days but with a very high variance (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract;jsessionid=F5E9F5BFC7933360C8C73C2E062575D9.f01t03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract...</a> )<p>- A single failed repetition &quot;breaking the chain&quot; does not have any effect on the development of automaticity of the behaviour, only repeated failures tend have a negative effect\n- It has been suggested that it is much more difficult to try to build multiple habits in parallel rather than serially (although I cannot quite find an authoritative source just now)<p>- Habits have a structure: Cue -> Routine -> Reward. It is useful to understand the conditions and motivation for a routine before trying to replace it (substitution approach)<p>- Furthermore, if trying to establish a new habit to reach a goal you might find that there is no intrinsic reward in the routine. It will be very difficult to keep up the routine like that, and it may often be better to look for a different way to achieve the same goal<p>- Habit formation can in some cases be thought of as a rewiring of the instinctive valuation system. For example a resolution to eat healthily might be helped more by giving yourself more exposure to delicious meals consisting of mainly vegetables,  than by a purely willpower-oriented method<p>For these reasons - I tend now to think &quot;less is more&quot;.It should be more about focusing on one or two correct habits and continually reevaluating them than to rely on a plethora of different external motivators to get you to do a dozen different things every day",1409502147

You choose your topics based on choosing your lab and the projects on offer - at least in science.<p>The observations from the author in the comments section that they know people who want to do a PhD (in Arts/Humanities) but can&#x27;t because they can&#x27;t find an offered project seems more like the system working properly - professors, who can be presumed to be aware of their field and by extension national interests via grants, offer projects to hopefully efficiently allocate the research dollars of the nation.<p>Which leads back to my first paragraph: in science I really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d get out of students making up their own projects in a vacuum. Which makes me think the author has a very narrow perspective on PhD research.",1409501662

This is not a positive for German industry, plain and simple.<p>The economic data of the last decade says EXACTLY the opposite. Record unemployment, record exports, very competitive industry ... - all despite the financial crisis.\nWe are talking about FACTS.<p>Fact is that the energy intensive industry has lower energy prices. Fact is, Germany has more industry than France, much more and it is also more efficient. Fact is Germany exports a lot of energy technology. Fact is: German industry has very efficient tools and processes - due to energy prices and the large amount of research and development in this area. Exactly this stuff sells excellent on the world market.<p>Fact is German&#x27;s industry is in much better shape than France. A simple look at the economic data should make that clear for you.<p>> Germany currently has low unemployment and high prosperity because it&#x27;s executing it&#x27;s own Marshallplan. Lending trillions to other EU states, and getting that money back through selling cars to them.<p>Fact is: Germany is selling world wide. Fact is: Germany is selling much more than cars.<p>> German cars are known for many good things, but their price is not one of them.<p>Okay?<p>> The price, however, WTF.<p>Last year Germany sold goods and services for 1.09 trillion Euros. All time record. Fact.<p>Despite energy prices.<p>If the Energiewende, which started in 2000, has had any effects on German economic performance, we want more of that.",1409501564

At this point, doing a PhD is a choice between academia and industry for the next 4-5 years. If an industry really exists (e.g. STEM fields), PhD programs must be competitive with it; they must offer something like a job. Of course, there are fields where PhD programs have less funding and the status of PhD employees is less frequent: a PhD in literature may have less funding available compared to a PhD in bioinformatics and will attract people that have different expectations.<p>About the freedom of choosing a thesis topic, I think this depends on both the style of supervision (controlling boss vs. laissez-faire situation) and the funding project (some have vague goals and can accept a wide range of topics, while others are very focused on mini areas).<p>And I think danieldk is right about the money: you are welcome to accept less of it, this doesn&#x27;t mean that the money saved by the state is really going where you want it to go...",1409500891

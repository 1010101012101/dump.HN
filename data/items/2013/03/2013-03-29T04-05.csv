Who wouldn't want their start up acquired?  I mean what's the point starting your own company?  The goal should eventually be an exit of some kind.<p>The news of Summly getting bought out by Yahoo shocked basically almost all of us.  It really flies in the face of all that we know too.  How often do you hear, ""you don't need VC money before you have traction, market fit, etc.""  It's bull crap.  I believe a huge reason Summly was acquired was because of the VC connections it had.  Without those connections and investors, that company with no revenue no real traction, would be swimming in the abyss with other start ups.<p>Summly basically is a company that uses another companies technology!!  I mean that's insane!  A tech company that uses another companies technology!  To be honest, I wouldn't be shocked if this deal falls through because of it's licensing agreement with their technology provider.  Maybe that's why the company is being shut down, and ""re tooled.""<p>The larger point I am trying to make here is that luck, is literally half the battle with start ups.  You could have the best product, design, etc. but if you don't catch a few breaks you will be nothing.<p>So I guess I can't get too mad at the Summly kid, everyone needs to get lucky once in a while.",1364532814

5459291,comment,5458915,5458915,8,0,ruswick,,,"As a current high school student, I can say that the trend away from tracking, at least in my district, is largely a product of parental indignation: they feel as though their kids are being systematically disadvantaged or academically repressed due to some sort of misguided assessment of their kid's innate ability. It's really pretty intuitive; no one wants to be told that their kid is too dumb to succeed in the upper-echelons of secondary education.<p>Although, in my personal opinion, tracking is probably detrimental inasmuch as success in high school is determined by sheer effort and monetary resources (and to a much lesser extent by academic ability.) Most people are capable of sufficiently completing most AP courses, but either don't have a desire to work for 4 hours per night on top of 10 hours at school, or aren't even offered the opportunity to take them. Because of that, tracking (like most other paradigms in k-12 education) rewards people with high income and supportive parents that compel their kid to take on more responsibility, and ends up artificially excluding potentially qualified students based on a test they took when they were literally 10 years old and is defined largely by wealth anyway.<p>On top of this, tracking involves a disproportionate allocation of resources whereby the ""smart"" kids get the most time poured into them, artificially increasing their test scores to a greater extent while leaving the less-qualified students out to dry. Malcolm Gladwell articulates this quite well in Outliers (which everyone ought to read). So, an arbitrary difference when one is 10 becomes a massive dichotomy when individuals are 18 because the kids on the higher track are given access to superior resources, while the kids who aren't are perpetually disadvantaged. Tracking takes minute differences in intelligence and, based largely off of one's circumstances and not innate ability, exacerbates those differences through unfair allocation of resources.<p>Tracking is largely arbitrary, enables disproportionate appropriation of district resources, and is needlessly exclusionary.<p>Just my two cents...",1364532713

It's handy because you can do null checking in the extension method. Additionally, you can add some extra logic for converting specific runtime types. For example, calling .AsBool() on a string can check if the contents of the string is ""1"" or ""true"".",1364530406

I was selected to join the GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) and suddenly school became more interesting. I moved to another part of the country and was enrolled in that area's GATE type of programming. By the time I went to Junior high, I was taking honors classes and this was when I started to shine academically. Unfortunately when I started the 9th grade, I spent one quarter as a high school freshman before I moved again and was put back in a middle school. Completing my 9th grade, they opened a 9-12 grade high school and with most of my peers became sophomores where I had to prove myself all over again, but I applied myself and graduated 6th out of a class of 600.<p>I believe the inconsistent curriculum between different school districts, and wildly different styles of teaching made this experience more difficult than it should have been. In hind sight, had I not been moved around so often, I would have probably skipped a grade or two.<p>It is also a product of the schools that I went to that you went to 4 years of high school. I know people who completed all of their high school credits by the time they were juniors and who got out of high school early. Had I known this was even possible, I could have easily met all my credits and left early as well.<p>I now think that the education system is inherently flawed. There is no reason to think that all students should progress through school at the same rate, but for me I was presented no alternatives. Grade levels do not adequately identify any student's potential any more than they identify what subjects or material they should be instructed. My reading comprehension has always been strong, while my spelling ability is only adequate at best. Without ubiquitous spell checkers of today, some might have considered me illiterate; hardly a fair assessment of my reading level yet early on in my education those concepts were seen as expressly linked.<p>I personally think one room school houses have value we no longer acknowledge. Allowing older students to impart their knowledge to younger students is a form of interactive learning that would enforce ideas for those older students. Allowing students to learn at their own pace, and not at the pace of their grade level would allow students who grasp certain subjects to drive through those quickly and receive additional instruction for those areas they may not be as advanced. I believe that while some who knew me in high school would say I excelled in school, the truth is somewhat misleading. I was kept back from excelling in certain subjects by majority curriculum requirements.<p>I don't know that I have the solution, but I think the current system is only capable of producing average students.",1364530307

I found I learned best myself when I had opportunities for informal tutoring, which happened more in the mixed-skill classes, where someone actually was interested in me helping them.<p>They weren't always the same sorting of skills, either. I would guess I was in the ""upper"" part of the mixed-skill classes in most of those I took, but I had some useful experiences when some of the same people I helped out in a science course in turn helped me out in an art course, which I wasn't great at. At least half the intrinsic joy of learning something, imo, is being able to share it with someone who doesn't (yet) understand it as well as you do.",1364529659
5459192,comment,5455869,5457344,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"That's the sweat of the brow argument: If somebody worked really hard then they should get a cookie. But that doesn't work. If Bob is a savant and he designs a brilliant hand-off algorithm in five minutes, should that not be patentable because he didn't have to work very hard, but an algorithm that isn't even as good should be because a much worse engineer spent a lot longer to design it? The result would be to reward mediocrity and waste.<p>Which is why we look at the invention instead of the effort. So even though I'm sure Einstein worked really hard on E=mc^2, laws of nature are still unpatentable, because it's a description rather than an invention.<p>The problem is that no matter how hard it is to discover it, we can't give you E=mc^2, because it only describes things. You can actually have implementations that predate the discovery, because it's possible to build something without being able to describe how it works. We had X-ray machines before we had E=mc^2 even though it describes their operation. Allowing a patent on anything following the description would allow too wide a scope. You would be claiming too many things you didn't invent.<p>But algorithms are the same way. They're not <i>inventions</i>, they're <i>abstractions</i>. There is a really cool ad hoc routing algorithm where you send packets along random routes but tag the routes, and then the more/faster packets get to a destination using a particular route, the more you prefer that route for future packets. Sounds like something that should be patentable if algorithms are patentable, right?<p>But it's called the ant algorithm. Guess why.<p>Algorithms are pure abstractions. Those little buggers crawling around leaving scent tracks everywhere have certainly never heard of your algorithm and have no capacity to produce any sort of a binary, but there they are infringing your would-be algorithm patent.<p>So you say, a-ha! We'll just make it an invention by applying a context. Then the wildlife will be able to escape liability (and hopefully stop serving as pesky prior art).<p>The issue is that the context is totally facile. The interesting thing is the algorithm, not the context. It's just taking the unpatentable thing and adding ""on a computer"" and claiming it as an invention. Sometimes they try to be subtle and instead of saying ""computer"" they say ""ad hoc wireless network"" or ""anonymizing P2P network"" or some other thing the meaning of which is always ""computer that could benefit from using this unpatentable algorithm"" as if to pretend that the limitation is meant as an actual restriction rather than merely a vague description of the circumstances under which the algorithm is expected to be beneficial.",1364529639

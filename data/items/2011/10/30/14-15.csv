3174504,comment,3173276,3173276,1,0,lsc,,,"one interesting aspect of this is that workers often need to maintain capital goods; equipment to do this 'shadow work' -  if you want a job in most parts of the country, you need a car.  But guess what?  that car isn't tax deductible, even if you only use it to commute to and from work.<p>The interesting bit here is that some companies, especially here in silicon valley, seem to be putting effort into doing more and more of this 'shadow work' for you and thus paying for it out of pre-tax money.   Google's free food is the prime example, but nearly every large silicon valley employer not only will pay for public transit out of pre-tax monies, but will also provide shuttles from the train station to the office.<p>A company can also provide a 'company car' but, well, the tax implications of that get complicated.  If you get audited and you didn't keep a careful log of personal travel, (and commuting to and from work is personal travel) and pay income tax on the miles you used for personal stuff?  you are in deep trouble;  this is why I own my vehicles outside of my corporation;  I get reimbursed for  business-related miles by the business and handle gas and maintenance out of post-tax dollars.",1319986476

I'm all for you trying. Keep in mind, though, that you might just get absorbed into the machine you're trying to fix.<p>You'll have to be extremely charismatic to get upper management to care about things like code quality and proper form. Management looks at IT, wrongfully, as a cost center. They don't realize, or care if they do realize, that poor code quality might make it cheaper to roll out the first few phases of the project, but in the long run make costs higher. Businesses think they are in business, rather than thinking they are in the IT business. Until companies learn they are in a hybridized model of software company and industry, they will never advance.<p>So leadership is needed to move them forward. I want to do the same. You will need to establish a game plan that requires total company reform. Until the business individuals go to meetings with IT with the goal of creating the best software possible, and until your analysts go to the same meeting with the same goal rather than wanting to just plow through requirements, and until your developers go caring to learn the business, your leadership will be completely useless, because no one is listening.",1319986148

I couldn't find any mention of average or worst-case latency, and throughput numbers alone tell you nothing about latency.<p>In particular, since each input event has to be journaled and replicated (which both involve I/O) before it can be processed, there is a potentially large and unpredictable delay for each event.<p>Another issue is that this architecture assumes that 1 CPU core is enough to run all business logic processors, and that 1 machine's memory is enough to hold your state.

Also, putting your first number in scientific notation helps put this in perspective:  2.2 x 10^12 .  Seven orders of magnitude.  Close to 15 000 0000 times as much.<p>That's not to say that work isn't needed to develop cheap recycling appliances, and to build water systems that recycle and reuse waste water rather than dumping it all into the environment, but it's not a very hard problem on the scale of things humanity can accomplish -- it mostly just requires more energy.<p>Energy will continue to be the limiting factor for a long time, and eventually (after essentially perfect recycling of all material civilization requires) the limit will be waste heat.  But as others have mentioned, we have a whole solar system to use as well, and moving the highest heat processes to space would allow us to radiate it away without affecting the earth.

I feel this is significant due to the prevalence of these platforms in engineering education as well as in industry R&D, test labs, etc. - in my opinion, the more (different) tools that are available and to which people are exposed, the more likely these people will be engaged (in the case of engineering education) or able to get their jobs done.",1319986016

It's impossible to watch a commercial on TV without the guy being an idiot and the woman being intelligent, no matter what the subject is. I did sociology and I'm aware of the statistics, however the statistics don't tell the truth.<p>On average the top 10% of women are only as strong as the bottom 10% of men. IIRC your average 25 year old woman who goes to the gym is only as strong as a 14/15 year old boy.<p>The difference between my wife hitting me is at worst a bruise, and me hitting my wife is a fractured skull. The difference between my wife slapping me is a red mark on my face, and me slapping my wife is her being knocked to the floor. I can take my wifes wrist in <i>one hand</i> and I can force her to the ground or I would break her arm if she resisted. If my wife takes my wrist in <i>both hands</i>, she's struggling to even force me to move my arm (this one she tried the other day cause I wouldn't touch the pumpkin goop).<p>The average woman has around 50% of the upper body strength of a male. Male bones are on average larger and denser than womens. Similarly our skulls are thicker, denser and have features like a bigger brow and stronger jaw than women. Our skin is literally thicker and stronger than women. Men have a naturally higher muscle-to-body-mass ratio than women.<p>I think on average men tolerate sexism towards them because we can, because we really don't need to defend ourselves from words. Women do need to defend themselves from words, because words are easily turned into actions and women can't easily defend themselves against actions.<p>I genuinely think that a lot of women are afraid of men, perhaps not consciously. Maybe not rightly so today, but only because of our society and morals. Society and morals put a decline in the male-female spousal abuse rates, to the rape rates.",1319984923

3174407,story,,,100,29,michael_nielsen,"For HN: Open access to scientific papers, a summary of the state of play",,"[EDIT: Available at the following URL with proper hyperlinks, per a suggestion in the comments: http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/open-access-a-short-summary/]<p>The topic of open access to scientific papers comes up often on Hacker News.<p>Unfortunately, those discussions sometimes bog down in misinformation and misunderstandings.<p>Although it's not exactly my area of expertise, it's close --- I've spent the last three years working on open science.<p>So I thought it might be useful to post a summary of the current state of open access.  There's a lot going on, so even though this essay appears lengthy, it's actually a very brief and incomplete summary of what's happening.  I have links to further reading at the end.<p>This is not a small stakes game.  The big scientific publishers are phenomenally profitable.  In 2009, Elsevier made a profit of 1.1 billion dollars on revenue of 3.2 billion dollars.  That's a margin (and business model) they are very strongly motivated to protect. They're the biggest commercial journal publisher, but the other big publishers are also extremely profitable.<p>Even not-for-profit societies often make an enormous profit on their journals.  In 2004 (the most recent year for which I have figures) the American Chemical Society made a profit of 40 million dollars on revnues of 340 million dollars.  Not bad!  This money is reinvested in other society activities, including salaries.  Top execs receive salaries in the 500k to 1m range (as of 2006, I'm sure it's quite a bit higher now: http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/01/02/acs-executive-compensations-for-2006/)<p>The traditional publishers make money by charging journal subscription fees to libraries.  Why they make so much money is a matter for much discussion, but I will merely point out one fact: there are big systematic inefficiencies built into the market.  University libraries for the most part pay the subscription fees, but they rely on guidance (and often respond to pressure) from faculty members in deciding what\njournals to subscribe to.  In practice, faculty often have a lot of power in making these decisions, without bearing the costs.  And so they can be quite price-insensitive.<p>The journal publishers have wildly varying (and changing) responses to the notion of open access.<p>For example, most Springer journals are closed access, but in 2008 Springer bought BioMedCentral, one of the original open access publishers, and by some counts the world's largest.  They continue to operate. (More on the deal here: http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/10/springer-buys-biomed-central.html)<p>[Edit: It has been pointed out to me in email that Springer now uses a hybrid open access model for most of their journals, whereby authors can opt to pay a fee to make their articles open access.  If the authors don't pay that fee, the articles remain closed. The other Springer journals, including BioMedCentral, are fully open access.]<p>Nature Publishing Group is also mostly closed access, but has recently started an open access journal called Scientific Reports, apparently modelled after the (open access) Public Library of Science's journal PLoS One.<p>It is sometimes stated that big commercial publishers don't allow authors to put free-to-access copies of their papers on the web.  In fact, policies vary quite a bit from publisher to publisher.  Elsevier\nand Springer, for example, do allow authors to put copies of their papers on their websites, and into institutional repositories.  This doesn't mean that always (or even often) happens, but it's at least in principle possible.<p>Comments on HN sometimes assume that open access is somehow a new issue, or an issue that no-one has been doing anything about until recently.<p>This is far from the case. Take a look at the Open Access Newsletters at http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/archive.htm and you'll realize that there's a community of people working very, very hard for open access.  They're just not necessarily working in ways that are visible to hackers.<p>Nonetheless, as a result of the efforts of people in the open access movement, a lot of successes have been achieved, and there is a great deal of momentum toward open access.<p>Here's a few examples of success:<p>In 2008 the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) --- by far the world's largest funding agency, with a $30+ billion dollar a year budget --- adopted a policy requiring that all NIH-funded research be made openly accessible within 12 months of publication. See, e.g.: http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/nihfaq.htm<p>All 7 UK Research Councils have adopted similar open access policies requiring researchers they fund to make their work openly accessible.<p>Many universities have adopted open access policies.  Examples include:<p>Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences: see http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/02/more-on-imminent-oa-mandate-at-harvard.html<p>MIT: http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/03/mit-adopts-university-wide-oa-mandate.html<p>Princeton: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/09/29/28869/<p>As a result of policies like these, in years to come you should see more and more freely downloadable papers showing up in search results.<p>Note that there are a lot of differences of detail in the different policies, and those details can make a big difference to the practical impact of the policies.  I won't try to summarize all the nuances here, I'm merely pointing out that there is a lot of institutional movement.<p>Many more pointers to open access policies may be found at http://roarmap.eprints.org/.  That site notes 52 open access policies from grant agencies, and 135 from academic institutions.<p>There's obviously still a long way to go before there is universal open access to publicly-funded research, but there has been a lot of progress, and a lot of momentum.<p>One thing that I hope will happen is that the US Federal Research Public Access Act passes.  First proposed in 2006 (and again in 2010), this Act would essentially extend the NIH policy to all US Government-funded research (from agencies with budgets over 100 million).  My understanding is that at present the Act is tied up in committee.<p>Despite (or because of) this progress, there is considerable pushback on the open access movement from some scientific publishers.  As just one instance, in 2007 some large publishers hired a very aggressive PR firm to wage a campaign to publicly discredit open access: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=open-access-to-science-un<p>I will not be surprised if this pushback escalates.<p>What can hackers do to help out?<p>One great thing to do is start a startup in this space.  Startups like Mendeley, ChemSpider, BioMedCentral, PLoS and others have had a big impact over the past ten or so years, but there's even bigger opportunities for hackers to really redefine scientific publishing. Ideas like text mining, recommender systems, open access to data, automated inference, and many others can be pushed much, much  further.<p>I've written about this in the following essay: http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/is-scientific-publishing-about-to-be-disrupted/. Many of those ideas are developed in much greater depth in my book on open science (http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/).<p>For less technical (and less time-consuming!) ways of getting involved, you may want to subscribe to the RSS feed at: http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/index.shtml.  This organization (the Alliance for Taxpayer Access) was crucial in lobbying for the NIH open access policy, and they're involved in lobbying for the Federal Public Research Access Act, as well as other open access efforts.<p>If you want to know more, the best single resource I know is Peter Suber's website: http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/hometoc.htm.<p>Suber has, for example, written an extremely informative introduction to open access (http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm).  His still-active Open Access Newsletter\n(http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/archive.htm) is a goldmine of information, as is his (no  longer active) blog (http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html).

""The JavaOne incident"" is probably the wrong battle to fight.  Regardless of whether Adam's joke was appropriate, attacking him for it provokes a defensive reaction from the frat boy culture (I'm going to keep calling it frat boy culture for lack of a better term). Some people won't see the big deal about how the joke was offensive and will instead be repulsed by the reaction to it.  In fact, Adam's joke seems to be just the kind of push back you would expect from a frat boy tired of being told to be more sensitive to his female colleagues.<p>Most men are like this.  We make inappropriate jokes to our friends and aren't afraid of offending them because they give as good as they get.  When a woman complains about this the hypothetical frat boy gets defensive because now he can't ""be himself"".  It creates a culture of us vs. them which is not at all healthy.<p>The real creeps thrive in an us vs. them environment.  Now they feel justified to harras women.  They go out of their way not to hire women, because ""all women do is complain"".  They can get away with, because the average rank and file frat guy doesn't feel any need to stand up for the feminist who has aligned herself against him.",1319983721

They do not consider this interpretation as 'the simplest'. Things hinge on such contentious points as the physical reality of 'the collapse of the wavefunction'.

You're engaging in the naturalistic fallacy if you think it does. What is the case in the world is not argument for what should be the case in the world.

Equating the communication with opposite sex to an alien is a common, common theme.

I think a good argument can be made that the sexist statement was <i>objectively wrong</i>. This argument has been made elsewhere much more eloquently than I can, so I won't try to repeat it.<p>But I think the fear behind ""political correctness"", which I used to share, is that whether one's behavior is rude is arbitrary and completely decided by other people.<p>I think ""you've been educated to the fact that the joke was offensive"" is misleadingly simple. What's true is that many people, including me, think such jokes are offensive. But more importantly, one can think about these issues from a neutral point of view. When I was prodded, as a teenager, to think deeply about such issues, consider other points of view, and talk to a lot of people about sexism -- I agreed with the conclusion that these jokes are indeed offensive.

There is no ""hoping"", the input disrupter garauntees a total ordering to events as written to a journal. this journal is then processed by BLPs.<p>RE: atomiticity -- the BLP processes one message at a time, which ensures that you do not have multiple threads clashing, but you do not have MVCC or any form of rollback, which he addresses thusly:<p>>LMAX's in-memory structures are persistent across input events, so if there is an error it's important to not leave that memory in an inconsistent state. However there's no automated rollback facility. As a consequence the LMAX team puts a lot of attention into ensuring the input events are fully valid before doing any mutation of the in-memory persistent state. They have found that testing is a key tool in flushing out these kinds of problems before going into production.<p>I am more concerned with the hand-waving around the failure case -- falling over to an alternate BLP on failure does not prevent you from duplicate instructions; if a processing an event would create multiple output events for the output disrupter, but the blp is terminated before all output events are sent you either a) must have some kind of multi/exec on output events or b) must write code that is able to resume the processing of a message from an intermediary point or c) must otherwise prevent or accomodate duplicate output events from the same source event.<p>This is a result of the lack of ""transactionality"" that you are referring to, and I would love to read more about how they address this particular sticky wicket when a system fails.",1319983477

Driving a go-kart is broadly similar to driving a semi-truck, but you only need a license for one.<p>Google&#x27;s (and other Internet services providers) terms of service restricting your usage aren&#x27;t anti-competitive in nature. The restrictions they&#x27;re placing on your usage of the content don&#x27;t prevent you from getting that same content from another provider (especially when we&#x27;re talking about public domain or fair use text.)<p>Carriers are regulated much more heavily than other businesses, because the nature of their business creates a disproportionate number of opportunities for anti-competitive practices and other shenanigans. Also, many of them have a monopoly or duopoly position in their marketplace, and as such are scrutinized more closely for anti-competitive practices.<p>Example: As a monopoly cable provider I can be the dominant internet provider in your city. So to extract more money from users, I create a new subsidiary owned by the same (unregulated) parent company as the cable division that charges for online video. The parent company then tells the cable company to throttle the bandwidth for all competitors so that everyone is forced to move to that new company&#x27;s video service, regardless of whether it&#x27;s actually a better product. This is anti-competitive and harmful to the public - rather than offering a better service, I&#x27;m using my ownership of one business to unfairly hamper free competition in another market.",1384829556

Your comments are interesting (of course, no way to know if you are who you claim to be, though, similarly for myself).<p><i>Larry&#x27;s fear of Facebook.</i><p>I&#x27;ve written multiple times on G+ why Google should be focused on Amazon, not FB.  Social is ultimately ephemeral.  The evaporative cooling effect <i>always</i> kicks in.  Given G+&#x27;s lack of effective filtering, sooner there than elsewhere.  I&#x27;ve posted far too often to Shimrit Ben-Yair (G+&#x27;s product manager) on aspects of this.<p>The other trend I see is self-hosting / distributed services becoming viable.  See FreedomBox as an example.  A few years off yet, but it&#x27;ll be a game-changer.<p><i>That damn red alerting bell</i><p>One of the first things that lead me to segregate my G+ activities from &quot;everything else I do on the Web&quot;.  I&#x27;ve actually removed the bell via user-side CSS (repeatedly, thanks to repeated CSS class-name changes) from other Google properties.  I ultimately found it was easier to 1) not use them when logged in (so:  in another browser/session), or 2) use other services (DDG, OpenStreetMaps, FixYT.com / Vimeo, etc.).<p><i>if Google+ loses, Google itself will become entirely irrelevant a short time later.</i><p>He&#x27;s wrong.  However if he keeps cramming G+ down peoples&#x27; throats, he&#x27;ll keep encouraging exploration of other servcies.  Particularly among the more technically literate and thought leaders.<p><i>I don&#x27;t know if Google will change, but unless Larry wakes up and realises Facebook isn&#x27;t going to kill his business, I think it will continue down the current path for a long time yet.</i><p>Sad.  In particular, even FB doesn&#x27;t suffer disadvantage that it&#x27;s sucking so much <i>else</i> of my information online (mail, video, search), though FB itself is pretty invasive (NB:  I <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a personal Facebook account).<p>As others have noted, the fear-driven strategy is <i>highly</i> reminiscent of Microsoft, and is among the factors which killed Microsoft&#x27;s brand among end-users (the OEMs and business partners loved them so long as the money kept flowing).",1384829362

Given that we aren&#x27;t sure what the real supply is (China&#x27;s biggest state secret), the price of gold will remain volatile.<p>> You think the Chinese want USD long-term? Why on earth would they?<p>They want to continue to sell us stuff without overheating their economy, which is why they are happy to buy treasuries at a loss (the interest is not high enough to cover inflation). No one is really unhappy, even the Chinese, that USD is a reserve currency as long as the American economy is robust enough to be the largest consumer as well as a debtor of last resort (via treasuries). Bitcoin does nothing here: the US is a safe entity to lend to, Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t magically create a similar entity.<p>Put it this way: money simply can&#x27;t be saved without someone else spending that same money at the same time. China couldn&#x27;t just sit on all of their USD, gold, or bitcoins even if they wanted to. Buying and sitting on gold doesn&#x27;t magically create or even preserve value that you can call on to use in the future.<p>The fix for China is simply to promote more domestic consumption so they need to save less, which would also balance out the export/import deficit. Given that consumption can only be increased gradually (too much inequality in China), this isn&#x27;t going to happen with a switch flip and in the meantime the Chinese would definitely prefer stability.",1384828700

Any individual can have as many wallets as they want, and while specific addresses and wallets are traceable, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to make indentifiable transactions from any given wallet. So, for example, one might have a &quot;public&quot; Bitcoin wallet, and a &quot;private&quot; one. The private one you use in the way someone who works for cash and tips might operate today...they don&#x27;t tell the government about all of it.<p>So, you&#x27;ve got your public wallet to prove you have money available, for making credit decisions, for deciding whether to sell you a house, etc. And your private wallet because &quot;fuck the police&quot;. There&#x27;s not even a good way to know if a wallet is located in the US or somewhere else.<p>And, if there are people willing to take coins from people&#x27;s private wallets, there will likely be a solid economy outside the government&#x27;s control; as there already is; there&#x27;s a massive barter and cash economy.

Even after they destroyed the concept of states&#x27; rights by passing the fugitive slave laws, they still weren&#x27;t confident that slavery could endure when the North was going great guns without it. When the North proved that they could elect a President without pandering to Southern Slave Power interests by electing Lincoln in 1860 without a single Southern vote going to him, that was the last straw.<p>(The election of 1860 was, in effect, two elections going on in parallel: Bell v Breckinridge in the South, Lincoln v Douglas in the North.

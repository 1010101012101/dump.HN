Moreover, it clearly was a reinforcing piece, not a proposing one, and there were other smaller excerpts to confirm this was the standard thinking at the time.<p>[1] Funny thing, I take &quot;Generation Y&quot; as the way people who doesn&#x27;t really care about generational studies talk about Millenials. I can&#x27;t stop thinking they heard &quot;Generation X&quot;, called this way at their time because they were unknown, and extrapolated the meaning without further thinking.<p>EDIT: too many &quot;about&quot;s.",1380833989

But that&#x27;s always the reaction in those places: no change here.<p>But there will also be curiosity that leads people to other more sophisticated takes on Silk Road and DPR&#x27;s philosophy. Here&#x27;s an interesting one:<p><a href=""http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2013/10/silk_road_shutdown_be.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2013/10/silk...</a><p>Silk Road was safer and cheaper than the very-violent legacy prohibited-drugs businesses. (Other smuggling cartels with $1.2B in sales likely have a lot more blood on their hands than two fake assassinations.) So here&#x27;s another potential takeaway worthy of discussion:<p> maybe psychoactive drugs <i>ought</i> to be a mail-order business, as a harm-reduction policy. USPS/Fedex/UPS can check proof-of-age on delivery, and people in addiction-recovery could be put (by election or court-order) on no-delivery lists<p> if an online drug vendor is being blackmailed by a hacker/disgruntled-employee threatening the release of customer information, that vendor should be able to go to the cops and have the blackmailer arrested under the CFAA. Same for an embezzling employee. No extralegal &quot;street justice&quot; required.<p> the taxes on such commerce could be spent to help addicts far more than today, and have some left over for spending on other social benefits",1380833779
6491981,comment,6491037,6491883,9,0,RyanZAG,,,"It&#x27;s not ironic in the slightest. He&#x27;s correct - the HN crowd is definitely afraid of slaving away for hours working on our own or other people&#x27;s ideas that are simply not useful to the world around us. We&#x27;re the guys who can dedicate our lives to the right cause and actually change human civilization in some small way (eg. searching Google for recipes, booking your holiday with some taps on a screen, paying your bills without going to the post office). However, if we&#x27;re not watching where we&#x27;re going, we end up spending 6 years (of 15 hour days) making a cat simulator that even cat lovers ignore after two minutes.<p>So he&#x27;s got the right assessment - we&#x27;re deadly afraid of slaving away at pointless work. If you follow the posts on HN, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s a constant reinforcement of people trying to determine if they&#x27;re doing something worthwhile - how to test the waters, which ideas are working well, how to efficiently accomplish tasks. He&#x27;s completely off the wall in believing this is a bad thing though. I pity that he believes spending an extra two hours each day digging his own grave deeper is in any way a good thing. His message is simply incorrect - work itself has no meaning. Only outcomes have meaning.",1380833767

The combination of excess workers and the menialization of many jobs prompted the companies to minimize their commitment to the worker, both in salary and relationship.<p>Once the relationship was gone and it was obvious to the worker that they were valued for their effort on the hamster-wheel, is it any wonder so many of them were lacksidasical about how fast they spun that wheel?

How is it different from Flash or Silverlight?<p>Oh, and to everyone that proclaims that DRM is bad. Many of you are developers for startups. Is your startup all open source? Why not?

YMMV if you extrapolate this to non-CS science and journals, so take this with a grain of salt.<p>The bottom line is I, as a powerless grad student, am _very_ comfortable with the level of reviewing competence I have witnessed (and been a part of).<p>The proposal to deanonymize reviews has a huge flaw: Namely, there&#x27;s no way I (as a grad student with no political power) will write a critical review of somebody famous if I know I won&#x27;t remain anonymous.<p>The risk of blowback is too damn high. (And given the small pool, writing style would probably be sufficient to deanonymize, if my entire trail of reviews were public). There&#x27;s no way I have the balls to write a critical review of a paper by, say, Robert Morris or Larry Peterson, for some prestigious venue such as SOSP, when I&#x27;m asked to write a review. Unless I know for sure that there&#x27;s absolutely no risk whatsoever of being identified.<p>Look. Reviewing is thankless and hard. Anonymity exists so that we can be critical and not risk career suicide. Last year at OSDI I received 9 reviews, and they were all exemplarily thoughtful, even the obligatory &quot;strong reject&quot; one of them. The problem of &quot;petty reviews&quot; _has_ a solution: The program committee is self policing, and the reviews are not anonymous within the PC. (For example, at SOSP this year, there are 28 PC members.) You know that most of your reviews come from this gang of 28. You might have one or two externally solicited experts in addition, but that too is not anonymous _to the PC members_. If there&#x27;s a culture of meanness, the PC members and PC chairs can fix this by internal policing (and they do).",1380832665

This was not just about getting bored -- his role in the company was changing, and his attempts to reverse the changes had little effect.<p>Sure, he could suck it up and adapt to the new role, becoming the best code monkey he could be.

The same is true of all the various music channels from the labels through iTunes to Spotify.<p>I like this because artists and producers will be able to negotiate with us directly which will lower the cost and the motivation to pirate.  I&#x27;m all for artists and producers making money on their work, but not all the various middle men this can remove from the picture.<p>I&#x27;m very concerned, however, about the possibly negative effect on things other than media content like the general flow of news and information.  Any item of information can now easily carry a price for internet access independent of the channels through which it moves.<p>Verdict: mixed bag.",1380831744

The market &quot;not changing&quot; does not mean it does not have a market price: it just means that the market price is constant (and that therefore there is no trading happening, except for the occasional new player entering and quickly losing money by playing a non-optimal strategy). You are saying the same thing, just in different words.<p><i>the predictions do tend to get better, even if you have unskilled participants</i><p>This statement as it stands is way too strong, which is why I originally objected. The correct statement is: &quot;predictions will tend to get better as long as it is possible for the average skill level of the market participants to increase&quot;. You&#x27;re right that participants don&#x27;t have to start out being skilled; but the average skill level of the participants does have to be able to change for the market&#x27;s predictions to change.<p>In the coin flip prediction market, that can&#x27;t happen (or at least it can&#x27;t happen for very long), because the optimal strategy for betting on coin flips is so obvious. In the Betfair card games, there is some scope for increasing participant skill, but there can&#x27;t be very much if the games are fair; people will fairly quickly figure out the optimal strategy for any given game, and soon after that the market will stop trading if the players are rational. (You appear to agree with this, since you say it&#x27;s &quot;disappointing&quot; that Betfair&#x27;s games continue to have money traded on them.)<p>Of course these are simple examples; what about real-world prediction markets? What about, for example, betting on sports games? My sense is that a similar effect occurs there: the average skill level of the long-term market participants is relatively unchanged over time, and therefore the accuracy of the predictions that can be extracted from the order book is relatively constant over time. The reason money is still made in these markets is that there is a basically inexhaustible supply of new players who think they know more than they actually do, and who therefore quickly end up losing their money to the long-term players--much the same thing that happens in casinos.",1380831710

The very fact that bets <i>can</i> be traded means that people can profit by betting on the beliefs of others, not on the actual outcome of the event the betting is based on.<p>The example of the McCain bets for the 2008 election is a case in point: if the author&#x27;s bet would only have paid off on the actual outcome, he would have lost! The only reason he was able to make money at all was that he found other people willing to buy his bets.<p>Similarly, in your asteroid example, yes, you sold your bets because information changed, but the reason you were able to make money doing so was that there were other people willing to buy your bets--which means their expectations about the outcome must have been different from yours (if they were the same as yours, no one would buy your bet, because the trade is zero sum). So you are making money based on others&#x27; beliefs about the outcome, not based on the actual outcome.<p>For example, if the asteroid ultimately does not hit, then all your &quot;yes&quot; bets are losing bets; the only reason you made money was that you sold your bets before the fact that they were losing bets became known for certain, just like the article&#x27;s author did with his McCain bets. But also, even if the asteroid ultimately <i>does</i> hit, your payoff doesn&#x27;t depend on that, because you sold your bets; someone else, who bought them, ended up making the profit you could have made if you had held them until the outcome was known. So once again, you made your money based on other people&#x27;s beliefs about the outcome, not based on the actual outcome.

I will provide an anecdote from my career to illustrate what I mean.<p>I have been working at the same company for almost 4 years. During those 4 years I have worked on the same project and haven&#x27;t really switched teams. I&#x27;ve seen employees come and go, architecture decisions made and debated ad nauseam, and so forth. I am currently in the processing of re-implementing some functionality and architecture decisions that I made when I first started (~4 years ago).<p>When I made these implementation decisions I thought they were the best approach based on my experience at the time. However, having stuck around all these years and seen the product and business evolve, these decisions have turned out to be either poor choices or not the most optimal. As a consequence I&#x27;ve derived a lot of experience and wisdom from revisiting these past decisions, as I am now able to go back with production data and performance characteristics and see how they work or do not work. This software that I wrote way back when functioned in production and worked flawlessly without ceremony for approximately 3.5 years. Only recently and under a changing production environment has this code started to become a pain point.<p>Had I been part of the new every two crowd I would have never been able to see how my designs and solutions would hold up, or fall down, over the years of their life span. Furthermore, I never would have gained the wisdom and experience that comes from implementing something and having to come back and re-visit it years later.<p>This is really the takeaway message I understand from the author.

I don&#x27;t agree with copyright law, but it is law.

4004903,comment,4003134,4003809,2,0,AJ007,,,"Ever played an early PC game where the programmer also created the graphics? That analogy has stuck with me my entire life.<p>I think in the educational system, as children and young adults we are taught that we must excel at as much as we possibly can. When, the reality is, doing really well in one area means your skills in another will weaken -- especially when you are trying to do them at the same time.<p>Ever met an accountant novel writer who base jumps on the weekends?

4004902,comment,4003673,4003976,2,0,davidhollander,,,"> <i>Can this eliminate the callback hell that plagues the explicitly async frameworks (node.js, jquery, twisted, etc)?\nBut what about the downside? Can you migrate the suspended coroutine to another process</i><p>No, Lua coroutines only provide language or syntax level concurrency. They make routines more stateful, which can be a benefit if you want to refer to the same local variables and scope in between yields, but do have the downside of incentivizing routines to be larger in size (although you rely on fewer of them).<p>Also, the use case for coroutines is really limited to expressing lists of serially occurring tasks. This can work well for request-response style applications. But if for instance, you need to be able to read from, write to, and wait for timeouts on the same socket simultaneously (say a chat room), it would be a bit silly to spawn 3 coroutines per client (or 1 with heavily branching code), and use unnecessary overhead than simply binding and dispatching function calls for events without using a coroutine.<p>Regarding dispatching function calls for events, this can also be done in a variety of ways without creating a soup of nested lambdas. For instance, local functions or object methods. This also avoids the instantiation of additional function values (lambdas) for each client, which doesn't really slow things down in Lua but uses up more memory.",1337633979

I agree with you too, much easier to control (hehe) or engage in the conversation rather than be the fly on the wall.<p>What really gets me though, is when you see those micro expressions flash over peoples faces and then you start to doubt what you perhaps misheard or what you should've said. This is the most annoying of all problems I've ever had to deal with, as I am constantly second guessing myself, which isn't pretty.<p>Another thing to all deaf people out there who rely on lip-reading -- how do you go for concentration and memory when it comes to having a decent conversation? If I concentrate <i>really</i> hard, I'll find that I can understand what's going on, and converse back. However, if I do too much of it, my brain starts to wander because it simply starts getting too tired to concentrate at such a high level for long which ends up making me feel stupid and I either only remember the start of what they said, or the end.<p>For hearing people, it goes like this:<p>>Person says something<p>>You then have to playback what you've just heard, seen what words they could have said with their lips, the context and the way their body language is.<p>>Your brain then does some computations and tries to figure out what's being said<p>>Your brain then tells you to say XYZ<p>This goes for <i>every</i> word they say. So if you're not concentrating at 120% you'll miss some words. Context is important, because I LOVE YOU can also look like COLORFUL if you're trying to lip read someone -- but you won't fool any professional lip reader like us ;-)",1337633663

So the author seems to completely ""miss"" the point of television and web based ""news.""<p><pre><code>   Priority #1: Get ratings, everything else is subservient to this.\n   Priority #2: Make your advertisers happy.\n   Priority #3: Inform the public.\n</code></pre>\nReally, they are in that order. So if you're not working on #1 you're working on #2 and if you aren't working on that only then are you working on #3. Generally organizations stay away from making up news from whole cloth (as wonderfully lampooned in Dave Barry's ""Big Trouble"") but they 'film' to get stuff for someone's eyes to look at during the story, not necessarily to report on what is being filmed. Then they tell their story and some film editor goes and cuts in bits of video that 'look like' what the story is saying at the moment.<p>So the fact that they filmed a talk you gave can have nothing at all to do with the story they are writing. So complaining that they used footage of you doing one thing, while they talked about something else, well that is their right, you signed the release. Now if you had added a codicil which said ""My only use my image when reporting on this talk about this topic."" That would have prevented them from using your likeness in the story.<p>True story, had a friend at a sports bar when a film crew came in to pick up background video. After the fact they passed around releases for folks to sign, and my friend, being precise, added a clause like the above to his release.

I can't really blame anyone for not adding a link to leaving a review after the user has given negative feedback, I definitely wouldn't to it.<p>Furthermore, I don't use iOS, but if review patterns are similar to those on Android(and I can't really see why they wouldn't be) then I can really see where the app's author is coming from. Most negative reviews I've seen(especially on actually good apps) have been things like ""1-star doesn't work!"" in a sea of ""5-star awesome app!"".

Not PhD level physics here, but not trivial and not something I would expect a UX guy to do.<p>So yeah, I take a bit of offense when you lump all programmers into the same bucket. Not all programming is engineering IMO, and to compare writing a UI to writing a thread scheduler, a memory manager, a new programming language, etc. is just ridiculous.<p>I'm not saying that UI work is dumb simple. It is incredibly hard to get right, but that kind of complexity is not technical. It takes a certain kind of aptitude and knowledge to do work that is closer to the metal and closer to concepts taught in CS. Creating a UI is not CS, it is wiring up bits of code that other people wrote in a such a way to be useful to a non-programmer.<p>So yes, a UX guy could probably be writing his or her own UI's in about 6 months to a year.

Me and many I know have routinely heard things like, ""I hate Vegas"" and ""How awful for you"" when we say we're from there.  The problem with the 60 minutes spot was that they did things like show an establishing shot of the strip and then cut to a bunch of teenagers hanging out in front of the Red Rock movie theaters that's many miles from the strip, but which had a blinking marquee that might look like something on the strip.  It clearly was meant to appear like the kids were handing out on the strip.  At the theater, they interviewed a girl I happened to know and I can't help but think that they cherry-picked her.  She was a goth chick - very smart and loved to be odd and controversial.  She said all kinds of things about her neglectful mother and other things that fed into their premise.  60 minutes has done some excellent reporting that's directly resulted in positive change and Vegas is not a shangri-la for kids, but the manner of that report has forever made me question the show's integrity.",1337631382

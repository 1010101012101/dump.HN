The only exception would be is if you are primarily handling financial transactions.  Then perhaps Oracle would be the way to go, since your customers will be more conservative about the technologies they would accept.",1186721388

41165,comment,41133,41162,0,0,dfranke,,,"The optimizer is smarter and it's better at concurrency control.  You'll get better performance out of Oracle when you have very-long-running transactions or lots of transactions at once operating on the same tables.  The former isn't a concern for most web applications, but the latter might be.<p>The above is received wisdom from academics, though, so it may be dated.  PostgreSQL has improved a lot in recent years.",1186720522

At least, that's the order of preference for me, but I avoid databases when possible.<p>Google uses MySQL heavily, so it obviously scales (but I'm given to understand they had to work hard to do it).",1186720484

41156,comment,41133,41133,0,0,staunch,,,"Oracle shouldn't even be on the table. If you get popular at all they will try to rip you off and likely succeed. Not to mention it's a beastly system to manage and you'll never use most of its unique features.<p>My preference is multiple systems. MySQL for most stuff and Postgres for reporting and financial data. It's <i>easier</i> to scale MySQL because so many people have done it and it's simple. Postgres has lots of nice higher end database features for reporting and I feel (a bit) safer having it handle money.<p>When the purchase cost for both is $0 and managing them is easy it makes sense not to force yourself into making a decision about which camp you're in. More important than which you choose is learning to leverage memory well. Memcached being the easiest scalable way to do that.

Lets play in fantasy land and say it does get that kind of traffic. I want to know if something like MySQL/Postgres/SQlite is up to the task?

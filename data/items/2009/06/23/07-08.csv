The real problem with noob coders is that most easy problems are not very interesting to solve while learning, but the interesting ones are too complex for beginners.",1245743180

In 10 years, the technology will be dramatically advanced and scaling will be far easier.<p>Just because it's hard doesn't mean it isn't worth doing anyway. When the Manhattan project started, they had no clue how they would come up with the theoretical quantity of nuclear material they needed. It was impossible. They went forward anyway and in the process invented the methods they needed to make it happen. Now we have nuclear weapons coming out of our ears.",1245742298

What about selling cards that are like game cards are for access to online news where newspapers are currently sold.<p>A lot of the general public would be against having to signup for a subscription to a newspaper online with a credit card or other online payment. I think a lot of papers online to are structured toward a model of drawing people in story by story from places like Google.<p>I a non tech person who still has an interest in a physical newspaper would go for a scratch card activated subscription service to an online paper structured more like a regular newspaper.",1245741667

669974,comment,669709,669814,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I met an innkeeper in Alaska once.  He and his wife had both once worked in technology in Silicon Valley.  When they got married, they agreed that they'd live like grad students.  That doesn't mean they were poor, but it means they'd forgo the extravagances like a big house and meals out and exotic summer vacations.<p>Then, when their son was 15, they bought a sailboat, and sailed around the world for a year.  When they got to Seward, Alaska, they decide they wanted to stay there, so they bought an old abandoned building, fixed it up, and opened an inn.<p>What struck me most about their story was how ordinary they were.  They did not win the lottery.  There were no hot startups or million-dollar buyouts for them.  They had a kid to take care of, and seem to have had him fairly young (the innkeeper was in his mid-40s and the son was in college, so they must've been about mid-20s when he was born.)  They just decided what they want and then worked hard for 15 years to make it happen.<p>There're a few things that really are out of reach for us normal folks - most of us will never have our own private yacht, or race fighter jets, or sail in America's Cup.  But spending a year traveling and relaxing and having fun is probably not one of them.  Or maybe it is <i>now</i>, but with a couple years advance planning, it should be more than doable.",1245741319

(In a hilariously non-controlled, do-not-quote-me manner.)<p>Rest your right arm on your desk with your palm facing upward.  Touch the inner side of your elbow and the tip of your middle finger, using your left hand.  At this point, I thought ""Wow, my arm is longer than I would have expected it to be.""<p>Now, take a pen in your right hand and use it as a pointing device to follow the words of this sentence.  Still holding the pen, replace your right arm on the table in the same position as you used before.  Touch your inner elbow and fingertip again.  (At this point, my first thought was ""Oh crikey it got bigger.""  Its funny, I actually perceived extra stress in my left arm, as if I were stretching to cover a distance that I had had no noticeable difficulty with 15 seconds before.)",1245741089

669967,comment,669761,669947,0,0,thwarted,,,"That implication neither confirms nor denies the ""difficulty"" of deleting your search history; three clicks means it's as difficult to delete your search history as it is to move a file to the recycle bin in Windows and empty it.  Fact is, you can't confirm that it gets deleted, whatever that exactly means, no matter what the UI is, but that has nothing to do with the ease of finding or using the delete functionality.<p>However, does the fact that a cosmetic delete function exists say that Google wants to allow you to actually delete something or just wants you to think that you are deleting something, and is this better or worse than Facebook, which doesn't even have a cosmetic interface to do so, other than perhaps removing your account all together, and has established and known TOS that say they can do whatever they want with the data you give them?",1245740873
669966,comment,669600,669600,0,0,sunkencity,,,"I think the key to write fast code is to compartmentalize. Write someting crappy but that's walled off into a class, or file so that it can be thrown away later on.<p>I'm a bit tired of the notion that all code needs to be ready for a mission to the moon, or needs to be reusable. It doesn't -- it just needs to do the job. If part of the job is to be the foundation of years of work to come, then yes, it needs to be brilliant.<p>If the code you are writing is a quick hack to generate some images or to present some data on a single web page, time matters more than that is can be extended ad infinitum. Write something quick -- and maybe you can have the time to write some tests as well.",1245740855

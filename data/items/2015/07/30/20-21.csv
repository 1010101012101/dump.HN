I&#x27;m not worried about being shot, I&#x27;m worried about the old saying &quot;You can beat the wrap, but you can&#x27;t beat the ride.&quot;  I&#x27;ve heard police officers complain about this very natural reaction, and the effects it has on their personal relationships (they generally only have other cops for friends).<p>The solution is incredibly simple, reduce the amount of power left to the discretionary use of the police officer.  A positive first step would be obliteration of the concepts of resisting arrest / obstruction of <insert contempt of cop excuse>.  The next step would be establishing a restricted set of circumstances where an officer is authorized to arrest vs ticket.  This would prevent the all too common case of an interaction, initially beginning with a burnt out tail light, escalating to the point where somebody is dead.<p>Once police officers are restricted to hallway monitor status in 99% of the interactions, and Hollywood action-hero status for situations that actually call for it, they&#x27;ll find the public much more trusting.",1438289863

Each user is going to get their own VPS through AWS or another provider, so most likely these &quot;hosts&quot; are technically physically separated.<p>This service is basically a drag and drop app foundation, its a glorified SaaS. It&#x27;s adding a layer of ease between having to purchase your own VPS and deploy these apps. Now someone can just purchase through this service, get their VPS purchased for them and deployed with a nice interface that magically sets up software.<p>What you&#x27;re mentioning is an entirely different business plan on its own. You&#x27;re talking about buying physical hardware, servers, switches, etc. Which would require setting up VLans...etc for true separation.<p>Cloudron is making an argument about privacy through the features they offer. I&#x27;m sure they would have loved to buy hundreds of servers and allow for everyone to have their own little Fort Knox in a Box but this is unobtainable from their viewpoint. They&#x27;ve come up with compromises to create a unified and monetarily obtainable product.<p>A good product is a compromise between what&#x27;s needed, and what&#x27;s available. You can&#x27;t make something out of nothing (most of the time). If the resources aren&#x27;t available, or if implementability isn&#x27;t possible then you start to compromise. This is what happened here. Two guys who had a similar idea of privacy wanted to get together to provide a nice server/cloud service, and this cool little website is the result of that. Maybe in the future they can get their Fort Knox going, but for right now I don&#x27;t see that happening because of the costs associated with it.",1438289856
9978050,comment,9977259,9977259,0,0,grellas,,,"Law is a strange business to which to apply automated functionality.<p>On the one hand, and especially touching on startup-related areas, the law can have incredible complexity. When you consider that corporate law, securities law (federal and state), tax law, contract law, employment law, and copyright law all apply in varying degrees just to do a standard corporate formation, you can imagine how many opportunities might present themselves for missteps for founders trying to guide the process themselves.<p>In addition, there is not merely the issue of overt error in missing legal requirements, etc. There is also the issue of omitting to make the best strategic choices from among those potentially suitable for a venture, and this means being able to stand back from one particular well-trodden path (Delaware C-corp with one class of common stock) to assess whether that path in particular is best for your venture. While many startups are well served by following the Delaware C-corp (single class of stock) path, others may not be. Believe it or not, there are some startups that are best incorporated in their own local state and not in Delaware. There are others (particularly &quot;lifestyle&quot; ventures, certain specialty ventures or bootstrap ventures that want to start on the cheap and convert later) that may be best served by setting up an LLC. Even in Delaware, there is the vanilla setup (and by this I mean even a savvy one like the type YC uses) and there are others using super-voting classes of stock or FF preferred or other variations. There are also fine-point decisions within a typical Delaware C-corp setup that can easily be missed. Do you axiomatically go for a cliff for founder vesting (like YC does) or do you use pro rata vesting from inception? Do you prevest some founder stock or not and, if so, in what cases? How do you handle acceleration of vesting on certain triggers occurring? How do you best deal with IP issues for various scenarios where multiple persons have worked on a venture prior to company formation? Even mundane issues such as how to handle real cash contributions sometimes made by founders without messing up the common stock price can prove troublesome if mishandled.<p>All that said, and on the other hand, it is true that many legal transactions today fall cleanly into well-established patterns that do not require any form of specialty legal help. While founders can and do often use law firms for such steps, it is a very legitimate question to ask, &quot;what is the real value from the lawyers?&quot; and &quot;is it worth the cost?&quot;<p>So you have the two sides of law: the incredibly complex and the perfectly mundane.<p>And here is the problem for many founders: not knowing which side of the line you are on when it comes to this or that issue in the choices you make when you form or build a venture.<p>Of course, when you also add the vast range of laws that apply to a venture beyond formation, the issue gets even trickier.<p>No one wants to spend money unnecessarily on things that don&#x27;t add value commensurate with what is spent. But no one wants to make crucial legal errors either. If a big one should occur, your early-stage cost-saving efforts can quickly transmute themselves into the penny-wise/pound-foolish category.<p>This is where the opportunity presents itself for tools and platforms that seek to streamline and improve legal transactions and this is what I like about Ironclad&#x27;s philosophical approach in particular.<p>The idea is not to have some end goal of replacing lawyers because that leaves founders helpless when it comes to the &quot;incredibly complex&quot; legal aspects of what they do in their ventures.<p>The goal is to streamline the process of working with lawyers while giving founders the choice to work without them, or to work with them in limited ways only, whenever they feel comfortable doing so. This keeps the founders in control of the process. Any founder who has been whisked into a legal environment where the lawyers are advising this and advising that, and are meanwhile adding a team of departmental specialists to the mix, just to handle what you might have thought a fairly basic set of issues knows the frustration of losing control in such cases. Even with the best of automated tools, that risk of losing control will never fully be eliminated, as law is indeed complex in many, many ways. But, whenever you can take that risk out for important classes of cases, you empower the founders to be much more in control than they historically have been. And that is what Ironclad seeks to do philosophically. The goal is highly commendable and should not be resisted even by lawyers. People have problems enough to deal with and no one, even lawyers, should have a stake in waste and inefficiency.<p>Even more, there is huge value in making legal transactions quick and efficient in their processing, whether working with a lawyer or not. If you can get your standard forms processed quickly and properly without a paper-shuffling and delays, that is a huge value in itself.<p>So here is hoping for elegant execution and great success. I had spoken with Jason about this back in the day when he was with Fenwick and he does indeed bring a great perspective, skill set, and passion to the task. Congrats on getting to this level and looking forward to what will follow in the execution.",1438289854

9978044,comment,9976298,9977300,0,0,ewzimm,,,"Skepticism of heavy tracking is absolutely justified, so I want to address that first. I&#x27;ve read Richard Stallman&#x27;s blog for the last 15 years, and he has had a lot of good thoughts about it. I think everyone should have access to privacy, but I don&#x27;t think everything should be private.<p>Games are a good example. Nobody would expect a baseball player to object to tracking statistics. That&#x27;s a big part of what makes the game. Online gaming is the same way. Tracking achievements adds to the fun for a lot of people.<p>But there are also larger social issues where tracking can be beneficial. We live in a world with a lot of diversity and an increasing amount of information. People get overwhelmed and tend to revert to tribal thinking, attacking anything that doesn&#x27;t fit their group&#x27;s perspective. I don&#x27;t know if people on their own could ever get over this type of behavior in a world that&#x27;s impossible to keep up with without taking mental shortcuts and relying on summaries of what&#x27;s happening.<p>Personalized deep learning is an attempt to create a relatively neutral arbiter of all this information, distill it into something useful based not only on the user&#x27;s behavior but also the aggregate of everyone&#x27;s behavior. The algorithms don&#x27;t just learn from what you like but have the potential to uncover interests and information that you might never be able to access outside your bubble.<p>Cortana brings that kind of aggregate information gathering to your desktop. It&#x27;s an early example, and it needs lots and lots of data to learn, and the more diverse the data set it can analyze, the closer it can be to doing its job of feeding relevant information.<p>Windows 10 is also meant to be an Internet of Things OS. Lots of companies are working on connected devices that depend on syncing with your account. A common example for today is telling Cortana to remind you to pick up milk when you&#x27;re at the store. The reminder goes to your account, and when your phone detects you&#x27;re at the store, it reminds you to pick up milk.<p>Of course, there are people who are going to try to use this to sell you things, but that&#x27;s always been the case. The hope of people working on these things is that it can bring you actually relevant suggestions instead of just the products with the largest advertising budgets. Old advertising models were very centralized and only the largest ones could really win. Personalized advertising might be able to bring the smaller but more relevant products to your attention.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like advertising, and I&#x27;m not especially excited about this part of it, but that&#x27;s definitely the monetary angle for it. The part that does excite me is the possibility that we can start to break down some of the communication barriers between people, get people outside of their bubbles, and bring relevant information to people based on large trends instead of isolated social groups.<p>There&#x27;s plenty to be skeptical about here. Money tends to push things in directions that only benefit the ones with money. Microsoft and all the other IoT companies have a lot to prove before their products can be considered actually relevant for people. There&#x27;s a good chance most of them will be no better than the old way of doing things. But there&#x27;s a lot of potential there too.<p>Privacy should always be an option, but having a public online life can be good for people too.",1438289823

9978038,comment,9977399,9977934,0,0,ircmaxell,,,"> PHP. This is a known weakness in PHP&#x27;s bcrypt implementation. From Wikipedia, &quot;Many implementations of bcrypt truncate the password to the first 72 bytes.&quot; I would hope that they&#x27;re using a competent implementation that either supports longer passwords or throws an error if it&#x27;s asked to hash a longer password.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s a known weakness in BCRYPT. PHP did not implement bcrypt, it was ported in via crypt(3). Meaning that ALL versions of bcrypt have this issue.<p>Some implementations error on > 72 bytes, but NONE of them accept longer passwords.<p>> I don&#x27;t think we know enough to conclude that they were definitely doing it wrong, but it would be nice to know more details about the algorithm, though.<p>Given what has been shared so far, there&#x27;s enough signs pointing that the chances are pretty high they did something wrong. 40 byte salt? Bcrypt only supports a 128 bit salt.

Don&#x27;t worry about using a real email address  – verification is turned off right now.<p>NOTE: For best results (by far!) please use Chrome or Firefox.<p>Before quickly concluding that this is yet another boring discussion forum, look again. It has a unique feature that I find fascinating based on the assumption that there are actually such things as “truth” and “fiction”, and it&#x27;s actually possible to discern the difference. Too often people find that they disagree on a topic only to eventually “agree to disagree”.  This is usually after dragging each other in circles in futile attempts to prove their positions. Valid points are often made but quickly obscured in the confusion of verbal battle. Subjects of even average complexity are very difficult to manage mentally. What is needed is a discussion forum that provides a format that helps manage this complexity. ProveIt! does this, and more.<p>Before trying to figure out what this website does, it&#x27;s important to understand that:\n1) an opinion is a conclusion based on limited (or uncertain) knowledge.\n2) Facts are not opinions.\n3) Opinions are not facts.\n4) Personal preferences are not opinions. (It is not your opinion that green is your favorite color. It&#x27;s either a fact, or it&#x27;s not.)<p>Anyone who says, “In my opinion, two plus two equals four” should be corrected and informed that this is not an opinion but rather a universally accepted fact. On the other hand, a claim that “Syracuse has the prettiest girls in the Big East”, should never be considered a fact until it has been clearly demonstrated as such, at which point it ceases to be an opinion. ProveIt!&#x27;s main purpose is to identify opinions as either fact or fiction.<p>Unfortunately, many people cling to their opinions with little interest in considering other views – or much less, changing their positions. They have learned to embrace the flexibility and almost limitless latitude afforded by this word. Their targeted audience is rendered defenseless and has but two options: either except these opinions, or attempt to argue. As many of us have learned, arguing is usually a fruitless endeavor as people will often deflect all facts and reasoning, and ultimately insist that they are entitled to their opinions. We are left with nothing but frustration. Dennis Miller made famous the line, “of course, that&#x27;s just my opinion... I could be wrong.” I recall laughing at the subtle irony! ProveItt! will force people to face objections and either accept them as fact, or refute them.<p>So with that said, feel free to log in. I&#x27;ve already been too long-winded here and could go on forever. Instead, I highly recommend you read the “About” and “Help” pages first. This will better explain what ProveIt! is, and how it works.<p>Although constructive criticism is welcome, please be kind! Again, this is my first website ever! In addition to technical observations, I&#x27;d really like to know what people think of the concept.  Although I&#x27;ve already implemented a lot of features (like “lone wolf” and “semi-private” posts and fallacy objections), I have plenty of other ideas swimming around in my head. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas! I sincerely thank anyone who takes the time to log in and look around.<p>Note that most of the existing posts are by fake users controlled by me. I attempted to emulate a realistic feed. Unfortunately, I found that this was harder than it sounds! Please forgive the lame entries! I&#x27;m sure real people could come up with more interesting (or funnier) topics!<p>Also note that most of the fallacy verbiage has not been populated yet. I&#x27;ll be working on that soon!<p>Thanks!!!",1438289420

But containers provide a TON of benefits, and you should absolutely be thinking about how to containerize your applications now. Just because it&#x27;s not currently ready for production doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t start getting ready to move to a container solution. The ecosystem will mature, companies will offer solutions for these problems, and it will eventually be ready for production. When it is ready, you should be too.<p>The big problem that Docker solves is the dependency problem. Specifically, it ties multiple levels of dependencies together with application code in a way that makes no assumptions about your environment and how well-maintained it is. It means that your CI system can test on the exact same versions of binaries -- and every dependency down to the kernel level -- that you will run on your production systems.<p>Many bigger companies will have multiple Yum/Apt/Maven/Git repositories, and with Docker, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Whatever is built into the container is what gets run. Most importantly it puts control of those things into the hands of the development team, not the system administration team. It allows you to more cleanly separate your infrastructure ops from your application engineering/devops, which is the prime benefit IMO because those two groups have never worked together well.",1438289134

You pay them for this service, and they have a public bond of sufficient size that if they screw up, a claim against their public bond will make the person affected whole.<p>This assumes a few things: dispute resolution services, flexible escrow agreements, and a lot of human judgement in a relatively corruption-free environment. My guess is that this is going to be expensive to provide, and might well rest up against existing contracting infrastructure (i.e. KPMG type agencies might offer a blockchain auditing service with insurance in some imagined futures.)<p>Hence I&#x27;d expect a long tail from high value, deeply audited contracts with insurance and bonds to back them up, through to collaborative pools that just note when they&#x27;ve been ripped off, down to &quot;it worked for me!&quot; reviews on forums.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a better solution than this, but it&#x27;s a topic of ongoing research and discussion.",1438288197

Even in areas of the city where buildings aren&#x27;t required to have off-street parking spaces, developers still construct them. And many of these parking spaces go unused—more than 30 percent in apartment buildings constructed after 2008 are empty at night, according to a 2013 report by the Sightline Institute.</i><p>The really funny part about this is just how high the demand is for on-street parking. When I owned a car, I regularly found myself parking several blocks from my apartment. Usually my car was almost as far away as the Downtown bus stops. (Buses from there run as far as Tacoma, Everett, Bellevue and beyond, somewhat obviating the need for a car.)<p>Further, there are at least 4 on-street parking systems - the Zone system applies on certain sides of certain streets and allows metered parking and free parking for neighborhood residents with a parking pass. Then there are 2 different seemingly-private pay-to-park systems. And there is a large amount of on-street area that is marked No Parking for various reasons including bus stops, infrequently-used driveways, loading zones, etc.<p>I&#x27;m guessing quite a few people would be willing to pay $1 to $3 for access to these unused parking spots. Maybe we could have an Uber/Airbnb for parking spots?<p>There ARE many public parking lots in the city, and while most are full during the day, many of them are almost completely empty at night.

9977751,comment,9976037,9976037,0,0,devalier,,,"From Steven Pinker&#x27;s <i>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</i>:<p>-------------------------<p>But of course the minds of men and women are not identical, and recent reviews of sex differences have converged on some reliable differences. Sometimes the differences are large, with only slight overlap in the bell curves.<p>...<p>With some other traits the differences are small on average but can be large at the extremes. That happens for two reasons. When two bell curves partly overlap, the farther out along the tail you go, the larger the discrepancies between the groups. For example, men on average are taller than women, and the discrepancy is greater for more extreme values. At a height of five foot ten, men outnumber women by a ratio of thirty to one; at a height of six feet, men outnumber women by a ratio of two thousand to one. Also, confirming an expectation from evolutionary psychology, for many traits the bell curve for males is flatter and wider than the curve for females. That is, there are proportionally more males at the extremes. Along the left tail of the curve, one finds that boys are far more likely to be dyslexic, learning disabled, attention deficient, emotionally disturbed, and mentally retarded (at least for some types of retardation).<p>At the right tail, one finds that in a sample of talented students who score above 700 (out of 800) on the mathematics section of the Scholastic Assessment Test, boys outnumber girls by thirteen to one, even though the scores of boys and girls are similar within the bulk of the curve [NOTE this was from the pre-1994 SAT where the math section was harder and not truncated at the top. Today the ratio is a bit less than 2-1 at the top end.]. With still other traits, the average values for the two sexes differ by smaller amounts and in different directions for different traits. Though men, on average, are better at mentally rotating objects and maps, women are better at remembering landmarks and the positions of objects. Men are better throwers; women are more dexterous. Men are better at solving mathematical word problems, women at mathematical calculation. Women are more sensitive to sounds and smells, have better depth perception, match shapes faster, and are much better at reading facial expressions and body language. Women are better spellers, retrieve words more fluently, and have a better memory for verbal material.<p>...<p>Nonetheless, discussions of the leaky pipeline in science rarely even mention an alternative to the theory of barriers and bias. One of the rare exceptions was a sidebar to a 2000 story in Science, which quoted from a presentation at the National Academy of Engineering by the social scientist Patti Hausman: &quot;The question of why more women don’t choose careers in engineering has a rather obvious answer: Because they don’t want to. Wherever you go, you will find females far less likely than males to see what is so fascinating about ohms, carburetors, or quarks. Reinventing the curriculum will not make me more interested in learning how my dishwasher works.&quot;<p>An eminent woman engineer in the audience immediately denounced her analysis as “pseudoscience.” But Linda Gottfredson, an expert in the literature on vocational preferences, pointed out that Hausman had the data on her side: “On average, women are more interested in dealing with people and men with things.” Vocational tests also show that boys are more interested in “realistic,” “theoretical,” and “investigative” pursuits, and girls more interested in “artistic” and “social” pursuits.<p>...<p>The most dramatic example comes from an analysis by David Lubinski and Camilla Benbow of a sample of mathematically precocious seventh-graders selected in a nationwide talent search. The teenagers were born during the second wave of feminism, were encouraged by their parents to develop their talents (all were sent to summer programs in math and science), and were fully aware of their ability to achieve. But the gifted girls told the researchers that they were more interested in people, “social values,” and humanitarian and altruistic goals, whereas the gifted boys said they were more interested in things, “theoretical values,” and abstract intellectual inquiry. In college, the young women chose a broad range of courses in the humanities, arts, and sciences, whereas the boys were geeks who stuck to math and science. And sure enough, fewer than 1 percent of the young women pursued doctorates in math, physical sciences, or engineering, whereas 8 percent of the young men did. The women went into medicine, law, the humanities, and biology instead.<p>...<p>Gottfredson points out, “If you insist on using gender parity as your measure of social justice, it means you will have to keep many men and women out of the work they like best and push them into work they don’t like.” She is echoed by Kleinfeld on the leaky pipeline in science: “We should not be sending [gifted] women the messages that they are less worthy human beings, less valuable to our civilization, lazy or low in status, if they choose to be teachers rather than mathematicians, journalists rather than physicists, lawyers rather than engineers.” These are not hypothetical worries: a recent survey by the National Science Foundation found that many more women than men say they majored in science, mathematics, or engineering under pressure from teachers or family members rather than to pursue their own aspirations— and that many eventually switched out for that reason. I will give the final word to Margaret Mead, who, despite being wrong in her early career about the malleability of gender, was surely right when she said, “If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values, we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric, one in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place.”<p>------------------<p>When you combine the imbalance in high-end math test scores, with the imbalance of innate preference for abstract work versus people work, it is not at all surprising that only 20% of Pinterest would be female.<p>If Pinterest feels like its hiring practice is not meritocratic, it should fix that.<p>If Pinterest feels like it is missing out on an untapped candidate pool, it should figure out how to tap that pool.<p>But there is zero reason to try to make the female ratio 30% for the sake of making it 30%. There is no moral reason, there is no practical reason. Males and females are different, twas ever thus. This obsession with equalizing employment number in all spheres is a bizarre (and destructive) fashion of our age.",1438287698

And for a technical audience, I also like to use the following (if oversimplified) description of Ethereum (quoting from [1]):<p>&quot;... In a way, Ethereum is like a cloud infrastructure that is extremely open. You can run any code you like in this cloud, as long as you follow some rules. Firstly, the code you run in Ethereum has to be essentially open source: you can only run your code if you publish it, unmodified. Secondly, even your database contents are public. (Privacy is still possible with client-side encryption, though client-side encryption will not work if the server also needs to read the data. In that case, preserving full privacy is still possible, though it may require sophisticated cryptography). The openness goes further: the underlying cloud infrastructure has no single owner. Rather, Ethereum is a fully distributed system, enabled by the block chain technology.<p>Why would anybody need this much openness? There are certain applications that truly require this level of trust and auditability. The Bitcoin currency is one example. Bitcoin already uses the same underlying block chain technology as Ethereum (in fact, Bitcoin pioneered it). It is unlikely that Bitcoin could have succeeded otherwise. Indeed, who would trust a startup that essentially prints and sells their own money, and whose founders are not known?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://ristoalas.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/what-is-ethereum/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ristoalas.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/what-is-ethereum/</a>",1438287026

They enjoy a brief period in which their income is essentially automated.<p>Phase 3: Companies use the service as a lawyer, lawyers only used in extraordinary circumstances.<p>A big part of the lawyer&#x27;s value proposition is about liability/peace of mind. Like, &quot;I&#x27;m sure this NDA is solid because if it&#x27;s not I have someone to sue, the guy who wrote it, my lawyer.&quot; That&#x27;s a valuable service, which is why they will stay in the picture during phase 3--essentially a liability limiting sign off.<p>Im sure you&#x27;ve thought about that, as your business model sort of hinges on having the lawyer take all the liability. Ie, the documents you provide are just &quot;suggestions&quot; or boilerplate for a professional to base their work off of, and those professionals are the ones who are actually liable for mistakes or oversights. It makes sense.<p>(Sidenote: I predict some hostility from lawyers here, similar to the hostility in the design profession over stuff like 99designs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll matter though. They will be hostile because they know that the tool, if it becomes widespread, would drastically reduce the number of lawyers who can work in the area, but they will each be incentivized to use the tools individually because it&#x27;ll save them time in their practice as they all race for the bottom, hoping that they are one of the few left standing in the aftermath.)<p>Anyway, you&#x27;ll have access to a very large dataset of those potential mistakes and oversights plus the tactics that work to solve them, and you&#x27;ll be able to hone the tool so that they become more and more rare (this is phase 2 from above).<p>But the thing I wonder about is what the second order effects will be. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re in a world in which Ironclad has won, and millions of businesses use it for the legal needs.<p>In that world you have drastically fewer lawyers handling more clients because the work is essentially automated and they are sign signing off. Each lawyer probably still makes the same money overall since the revenue per client is much lower.<p>At some point something will go wrong, and the lawyer will be on the hook for having screwed up. And he&#x27;ll say &quot;Wait a minute, I&#x27;m not the one who screwed up. I used the Microsoft of legal services, the one you can&#x27;t get fired for choosing, the huge goliath that lowly me could never hope to question because they have the most legal expertise in the world. I used Ironclad. They said this document was right, who am I to say otherwise? I trusted them, and they are the ones who screwed up.&quot;<p>And at first it won&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s not how professional liability works, so that lawyer will get ground up in the gears. Maybe the scrappy ones will sue you, and you&#x27;ll take your knocks, mostly winning or settling.<p>But I wonder if maybe when there&#x27;s an army of rubber stampers who are essentially not doing anything except saying &quot;If Ironclad screwed up this document, then I&#x27;ll take the fall,&quot; then with enough case law the environment will change, and somehow Ironclad actually would be saddled with a greater proportion of the liability? Normally I imagine things like that wouldn&#x27;t work because no one will fight enough to place the liability where it probably belongs, but in this case you&#x27;ll be up against LAWYERS, whose profession it is to deal with and fight for/against laws. That might make a difference in the very long term.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;d be a good problem to have since it would mean you won like 20 years ago. Good luck guys, I think it&#x27;ll be big!",1438286652

Potential advantages are manageability, scaling, cost reduction due to pay-per-use, and integration with popular cloud tech (eg Docker) pre-installed on that server.

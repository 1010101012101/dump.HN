I'd like to see what people think of it and if anyone has anything to add to it.<p>The idea, right now, is to add numbers together to hit the target number, and gain points to change the target value.",1230191892

I've had probably 5 serious projects that eventually got abandoned because a) no business model, b) no users, and c) stupid idea. But the knowledge I gained by creating these projects? Priceless._</i><p>No worries Dave. I don't take stuff like that personally. I have appreciated the experience of getting all the feedback. Creating this crappy project makes me super-excited for the next one, and I agree about the learning. I've learned a great deal from this.<p><i>_It's better to fail & learn on crappy projects so when you find a great idea you can just knock it out of the park._</i><p>Totally agree.",1230191604

It takes months of work and effort into ensuring that you are noticed as a ""power user"".  It's not easy, but there's nothing stopping people from putting in the effort if they really wanted to.<p>As to preferred policies in the government... I have no idea.  I'm assuming that if you put in years of work starting a special interest group and doing fund raising for politicians, you might be able to get a rider attached to a bill.",1230190223

What's so different?<p>Yeah, ok, they can't march into the street in protest of their government, but are they really that much worse off in the material sense?<p>Before you break out the numbers - keep in mind that while they make <i>far</i> less than Americans, their cost of living is similarly lower. I find the Chinese urban middle class lifestyle to be comparable to the American middle class lifestyle, sans a few things like a huge backyard.",1230189810
409474,comment,408801,409200,0,0,nir,,,"Personally I'm not sure, overall, Mongrel was a good thing. The Ruby web community should have focused on working well with existing web servers (mainly Apache) instead of building their own. Phusion Passenger is, in my opinion, the best thing that ever happened to Ruby in the web space, since Merb & Rails.<p>I don't know if the Merb/Rails merger would have happened if the ego-inflating hype around Rails was still on. In that sense, maybe Mongrel's main benefit (IMHO) was that it gave Zed credibility which made his ""Rail Ghetto"" rant significant.<p>I agree everyone is replaceable, and yet - surprisingly small number of people out of those who have the skills to build such projects actually bother to do it. It's easy to know how to build something, hard to actually do it, from start to finish.",1230189717

The brain is plastic; it's shaped directly by experiences.<p>If you never speak to a child from birth to 4 years old, it will be unable to learn to speak. That part of the brain will simply have not developed. There's no reason to believe that this is not true of all the other skills you mention.<p>If you had started doing that ""supervisory"" role 3 years earlier, you would have been great at it by 16. Similarly, most people start doing that sort of thing at 22, so at 22 they are where you were at 16, meaning they were 6 years behind.",1299596287

What's evolutionarily normal is to have children who are surrounded by, and interact mostly, with adults, in a group where many of the people are your family. The adults bring you up to their level. The kids keep you at your current (their) level.<p>No wonder kids today are more and more emotionally & intellectually stunted. None of them are ""the dumbest guy in the room"" - because they interact almost exclusively with other kids their exact same age.<p>30 kids and 1 teacher… the 1 teacher is not enough of an influence to make the kids feel ashamed of being so immature.<p>I, for one, have thought it was clear from history that ""teens"" are made. I grew up with lots of responsibility and it was clear to <i>me</i>, even as a 10-year-old, how different that made me from the kids I went to school with. The having of the responsibility wasn't what made me different, but it obviously made me think and behave differently too.<p>IMO the only reason that upper middle class kids today --  who are the ones always studied -- don't develop the part of the brain that connects cause & effect, & prevents risk-taking, is because they are never allowed to have enough power to fuck up.<p>How can you learn that stupidity leads to crisis if you're never allowed to make your own decisions?<p>The brain is plastic, it changes based on what you learn. A child kept away from speech until he's 4 years old will be unable to learn to speak normally. A teenager kept away from responsibility & work of value will grow up to be...<p>But the ""scientists"" who do these studies make pronouncements about their studies, but they never say ""Sheltered white upper-class kids with two parents have the following traits..."" they say ""Kids have the following traits...""",1299596004

Not surprising, really, since I knew it myself when I finally hit the wall (but not the lead up).<p>I'm an entrepreneur and I've been working at my startup for a year. I stopped exercising (partially due to a long term sports injury I was recovering from) and I was heads down on my project full time. After some cofounders didn't work out, I resolved to work harder.<p>Oh yeah did I mention I was having a kid and looking to move? ;P Sure ingredients for burnout.<p>I thought I could be Superman. I think adversity would only make me stronger. It did but it broke me down before it built me up.<p>It culminated with the move and then the kid. After we moved, I spent about a month not working, not reading TechCrunch, and removed myself from most hardcore tech activities. I spent it renovating the house for the kid. It was still stressful but my mind rested from the startup.<p>At this time I started exercising again. I was out of shape but my injury recovered enough to do sports again.<p>I then had my child. And while it was a new addition in my life that required a certain amount of time there was a certain (re)birth in my desire to restart/continue my startup.<p>Now I'm working harder than ever and motivated. Yes, it's tough and when I think about all the ways my startup can go down in a ball of flames (or a whimper) it gets stressful. But the other 90% of the time I'm really excited and can't wait to work more.<p>The ultimate lesson, as stated below, was balance. The startup ended up being a longer haul than I thought.

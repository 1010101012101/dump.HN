Pixza's gameplay revolves around pixels as the basic objects. In a nutshell, the live real-time action takes place on a grid board on which two teams race to fill their respective designated areas hidden from each other, with pixels. The team which fills its area first wins.<p>We are using Facebook Connect, and frankly part of the motivation in building Pixza was the lack of any quality multi-player game on Facebook. Those farming, fishing and mobbing types of games which claim to be ""multi-player"" are in fact asynchronous games, while in Pixza you play with your team mates in real time, synchronously. And did we mention we don't use Adobe Flash? Pixza works on just HTTP and COMET techniques and so with a few minor UI tweaks, Pixza should work on the iPad and iPhone too.<p>Game link: http://pixza.com<p>We have also made a screen capture of an actual game here (speeded up): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKMDitT_uwc&NR=1<p>(Clickable links in the comments)<p>We are basically a team of two college students from India, who worked on this part time for the past year or so, and we have been beta testing the game with all our friends. We are now ready to bootstrap and publicise it, and we want your views on Pixza.<p>Thanks a lot!",1273769967

In the late 80s people who wanted a portable computer were happy with 10-15lbs machines that were basically portable desktops. Throughout the 90s we started to get something that looked like a modern laptop but still too heavy an expensive for most people to carry around. In the mid-00s we get the modern version of a laptop. ~5-8lbs, wireless connectivity, fairly inexpensive. In the last few years we're seeing the shift towards even smaller machines. Inexpensive <5lbs net books with wireless connectivity standard. So maybe the next step is <2lbs tablets. The trend of evolution is pretty clear: Smaller, more connected, lighter, cheaper, better battery life. For lots of people a MacBook Pro is no longer the ideal of portability. It's a heavy integrated desktop that has to be plugged in every 3 or 4 hours to keep working.",1273769710

In particular, the three Google-released devices are the Passion (Nexus One), Magic (Ion), and Dream (ADP1).<p>> Does doing that void any warranties?<p>For the Nexus One, yes.

You can essentially boot a ""restore"" image as if it were a live cd, and then use that to install new system software.<p>> is any kind of jailbreaking or exploitation of bugs needed to get builds not released by the manufacturer onto the device?<p>That varies with the device. For the Google-released devices, the most you'll need is to grab the ""fastboot"" tool and run ""./fastboot oem unlock"".

When the sun is directly overhead, radiation passes through 9,300 meters of atmosphere between the surface and 300 mb. When the sun is at an angle, it must pass through a greater length of the atmosphere before reaching the surface. When the sun is passing through the atmosphere at a 45 degree angle, the radiation must pass through 13,000 meters of atmosphere between the surface and 300 millibars. When the sun is passing through the atmosphere at a 5 degree angle, the radiation must pass through 107,000 meters of atmosphere between the surface and 300 millibars.<p>""The amount of scattering and refraction differential depends on how far the sun's radiation must pass through the atmosphere. As the length of passage of light through the atmosphere increases, the amount of scattering and the refraction differential increase. When the sun or moon are within about 10 degrees of the horizon, they have the illusion of looking much bigger than they do higher in the sky and the coloring looks different. This increase in scattering is also the cause of sun sets and sun rises giving a red color on the horizon. Although the size looks different when close to the horizon, it is mostly an illusion.""<p>Taken from <a href=""http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/215/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/215/</a>",1273767458

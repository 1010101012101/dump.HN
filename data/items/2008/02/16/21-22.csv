117140,comment,117127,117127,0,0,burnout1540,,,"Okay, I'll start.  I'm 24 and living in San Francisco.  I'm a programmer but would like to find another technical person to work with. I have three ideas for a startup:<p>1. An easy software solution for multivariate testing web pages.\n2. A bid management tool for PPC. I'm thinking something like www.efrontier.com, but for small and medium sized businesses.\n3. Totally different from the top two, but I'm interested in a personalized (or well-balanced) news site. Findory would be the best comparison. Of course, it failed, so I am a little bit hesitant and I think relying on advertising as your only revenue source is very risky.

117138,comment,117118,117128,0,0,curi,,,"While I agree with you that avoiding those discussions is a reasonable general policy, it's not the case that ""no one is really right or wrong"" in debates about computer languages, politics, or religion. There is a truth of the matter.<p>Your point that not much is accomplished by such discussions is definitely what usually happens. But it isn't what <i>must</i> happen. There are rational ways of discussing these subjects which can lead to knowledge creation and agreement.<p>The reason I'm posting is basically that I think people are a little too quick to give up, and if they tried to discuss seriously a bit more, they might find it sometimes works. Especially if they are careful to ignore the bad replies they get and only reply to the other people who are also taking the discussion seriously.",1203198629

It offers a lot of obvious advantages to a power email user over Yahoo! Mail.  I have also noticed that those who are technologically inclined are often slightly more affluent than those who are not, perhaps due to in-demand skillsets causing jumps in pay rates versus other jobs.  So maybe the money is sort of a side effect of technological knowledge.<p>Just my .02.",1203197940

Probably more often than most others would recommend.  My reasons?  1. In the long run, everyone will be better off.  2.  If's not how quickly you get started; it's how quickly you get done.  3. I just don't feel like working on crap today (or any other day).  4. I want to write something I could be proud of.<p>Sometimes it just takes a rewrite in order to put yourself in a position of writing code you can be proud of.",1203195712

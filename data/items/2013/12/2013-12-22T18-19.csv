In addition, we could write programs that transformed or modified our code bases.\n>This lets the &quot;hard work&quot; of compiler/parser building be centralized to a few developers, but spreads the benefits around to most everyone.<p>Oh no you are not wriggling out of that one. Every developer should know how to write a parser and a compiler, not full fledged ones, just enough to implement a small language. That is in essence what computing is about, composing and instantiating formulae, with a full grasp of its semantics. To call your self a computing professional without knowing about parsing is like calling yourself a medical professional without knowing anatomy. This can only happen in the world of computer programming. It is the very essence of what we do, and how such a situation exists is an indictment of the computing profession, its educationists and educators.<p>It is the very soul of computing.<p>We might get away with it in the eyes of the public who don&#x27;t know better because we produce the results they want, internally we shouldn&#x27;t kid ourselves.",1387738276

It is what happens when a bunch of lookie-loo viewers want to be involved in the debate but can&#x27;t keep up on the issues. I struggle to completely follow the tech here but my job occasionally brings me close enough to crypto that if nothing else I understand the huge disparity between the technical discussion and the superficial one at play here.<p>Attempts to fit this disagreement into the same oblique, non-existent, ideal behavior for a disagreement subverts the ability to productivity disagree and makes behavior worse overall.  Your remedy is for them to not disagree.  I take it differently. I want them to disagree, but I don&#x27;t want anyone involved in the disagreement to dishonestly play to the masses.  But that would involve conceding a point, and what would that do to the bottom line?<p><i>Focus on selling the TextSecure app and not looking to takeout anyone who has a different approach.</i><p>You mistakenly seem to think that TextSecure exists primarily for profit.  It is obvious the aim is good crypto.  They&#x27;re playing a different ball game than Telegraph&#x27;s freemium model, one where marketplace success doesn&#x27;t determine if they implemented their crypto right.  Promoting _that_ involves explaining why the Telegraph tech is deficient.<p>Back to the cable news analogy, in a post of yours further down the thread, you bring up what the right level of security is for this app.  That&#x27;s a good question, one moxie (I think) brought up days ago by pointing out they didn&#x27;t have threat model and tptacek (I think) called them out for using nation-state actors as the adversary in selling the app.  They played that card in technical criticism, you bringing it up here for goalpost shifting now that they&#x27;re starting to look bad and you want to keep driving down the middle of the disagreement.<p><i>PS: I have no relationship with either party. I am a neutral observer that has his own opinions.</i><p>Oh, I know. You&#x27;re playing into the US-politics detached observer rote well.

The Army is considered to be the service which is the least concerned with its service members.<p>That said, the Army most certainly DOES have regard for its enlisted.  When things like this happen, bad PR follows.  Bad PR is bad for a variety of reasons, one of which being that it makes recruiting more difficult.  People will be much less likely to join an organization which doesn&#x27;t care about them, and would thus require more incentives to do so, incentives which cost money.  Two: soldiers, airmen, etc go through a pretty intensive training process that lasts several months at a minimum, and that training isn&#x27;t cheap.  By the time you&#x27;re a full-fledged member of your respective service, your service has a lot of money invested in you, and the more advanced in your career you are, the more valuable you are to them.  Soldiers cost more money than you imagine.  Three: morale in the military is of paramount importance.  Without good morale, operations break down.  If a group of soldiers feel that their leadership doesn&#x27;t care about them, morale quickly goes into the toilet, and that has all sorts of detrimental and pervasive effects.<p>When I was in the Army, I got sick of having to always go to another meeting about another program that, should we need it, was available to us.  Everything from PTSD counseling to going outside of your chain of command if necessary to financial counseling to healthcare to complaining about the food, barracks, or what have you - there were channels galore to address grievances.  They not only create these programs, but they force you to be aware that they exist.  These aren&#x27;t programs created just for show; they&#x27;re programs which are created to be used.<p>This isn&#x27;t the Vietnam Era.  The military is an all-volunteer force, and unless the draft comes back, it can&#x27;t afford to not care about its members.  In an organization of many millions of people who constantly deal with difficult, dangerous things like this, incidents will occasionally occur, but they are the exception, rather than the rule.",1387737938

Same thing goes with silverlight, even in a discontinued state, it still is going to have years and years of bug fixes.  Just no new functionality.<p>The fact is, even today with all the frustrations I have with WPF been &#x27;unfinished&#x27; it is still a lot more pleasurable than HTML/Knockout or something that tries to make HTML palatable.<p>A quick search in London on your favourite job site shows that learning WPF hasn&#x27;t been a waste of time, my skills are not in a vacuum, I also have strong OOP skills, whilst knowing how to run software projects.  Plus learning something is never bad.  Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone learning it now.  But compare it with whichever flavour of the month framework people are loving right now, people who&#x27;ve learn say Ruby on Rails aren&#x27;t as fashionable as say Node.js is right now.

The first was to air crews who were swabbed upon returning from search and rescue (SAR) missions, 17 of whom were found to have received the equivalent of a month&#x27;s radiation and had to be decontaminated.<p>The second exposure occurred when the carrier&#x27;s shipboard alarms went off. Since the Reagan is nuclear-powered, it has sensors to detect radioactivity, said Martin, and those went off as soon as the radiation levels went above the naturally-occurring background.<p>...<p>The aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan was about 100 miles offshore when its instruments detected the radiation. The fleet said the dose of radiation was about the same as one month&#x27;s normal exposure to natural background radiation in the environment, and no one was exposed to levels that would have made them sick, reports CBS News correspondent Celia Hatton.<p>The power plant and its plume are south of Sendai, so as long as the wind doesn&#x27;t shift, the Reagan can stay out of the plume and still be in position to conduct SAR missions.",1387735314

I don&#x27;t get 1000 as the average lifespan, though, I get 999.  Can someone explain where I&#x27;m going wrong with this reasoning?<p>If there is a 0.001 chance of dying every year, the average lifespan will be 0(0.001) + 1(0.001)(0.999) + 2(0.001)(0.999)^2 + 3(0.001)(0.999)^3 + ... , or \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty (i(0.001)(0.999)^i).  The idea is that to live to the age of 0, you have to die in your first year; to live to be three, you have to live through exactly three years and then die, and so on.  Then, \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty ix^i is x / (1-x)^2 .<p>So the sum of interest is 0.001 times (0.999) / (0.000001), which is exactly 999.",1387735244

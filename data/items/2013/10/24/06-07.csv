6603755,comment,6603562,6603562,90,0,mistercow,,,"Something I&#x27;ve yet to see explored is the difference between negative and positive willpower. For example, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to do something I don&#x27;t want to do, and easy to procrastinate. But it is relatively easy for me to have the willpower <i>not</i> to do something that I <i>do</i> want to do.<p>On the other hand, many people seem to have the opposite problem; they find it relatively easy to do things that are unpleasant, but difficult to restrain themselves from indulging in the things that they enjoy.<p>Of course, you can have a mix of both problems, and it might vary based on what makes the activity unpleasant or pleasant. If something is physically addictive, then someone with strong restraint might find an exception there. And if a task is stressful or painful rather than merely cumbersome or boring, someone with strong proactive willpower might still have difficulty with it.<p>But I think it&#x27;s worth investigating because it seems plausible that these are entirely different problems conflated by language. And it seems likely that totally different strategies would be needed for managing them.",1382597828

Household businesses can thrive and work together to accomplish great things, with unconventional organizational structures (or entirely informal ones).<p>When LedgerSMB forked I remember working late hours in a hotel room with my wife and son (I had a contract for my business that took me out of town, and we all decided it would only work if we all went), and having sessions with Chris Murtagh who would be typing with one hand, and cradling his infant son in the other.  Almost every work break would be spent with my family, except for lunch that year (and only that year).  Almost every hour not spent with my family would be spent working.  Work and family formed the warp and weft of my life.<p>Fast forward five years, and what&#x27;s happened is that these have become even more integrated.  I schedule my work around family time, and my family time around work.  In emergencies I may have to rebalance.  But these are all deeply integrated.<p>In the distant past, this was actually the norm, so it is not that I can do something today that none of the great men in the past could do, but rather that I can return to the solutions which have worked.  To some extent the internet enables this, but it isn&#x27;t really enabling something new.  It is rather re-enabling something very old.<p>Interestingly I don&#x27;t think double entry accounting was invented by monks sitting in monasteries, but by the collaboration of merchants (whose families were effectively helping run the businesses).

35118,comment,35111,35113,0,0,aaroneous,,,"While a 50/50 ownership+voting split may seem ""fair"", your lawyer is right that it can easily create a situation where it is difficult to make resolutions and get things done. And in the world of a startup, the inability to quickly make decisions can be the equivalent of cutting off your own air supply. While it may mean one less point of equity today, it could be the difference between your startup ultimately going anywhere for both of you.",1184799117

35113,comment,35111,35111,0,0,myoung8,,,"I know another startup that was faced with a similar issue (they have since been acquired, proving that this does, indeed, work)--they decided to split it 49.9/50.1 with the person who thought of the idea first getting the majority.<p>Naturally if you have thousands of shares, just take one from the person who's going to get less equity and give it to yourself (assuming all shares have equal voting rights). <p>Another alternative is to split the equity 50/50, but have the voting rights divided differently. This is a pain in the ass because you have to insert a bunch of (extra) legal mumbo jumbo in the operating agreement for tax purposes.<p>A potential problem is if you both sort of thought of the idea together (i.e. it was an iterative process). Well, then, if you are adamant about a 50/50 split, you can always resort to third (neutral) party arbitration if a dispute should arise, but this is a pain.<p>I would do it 49.9/50.1---one of you must have started this entire process.",1184798371

35111,story,,,14,15,nostrademons,"Ask News.YC: How do you handle dispute resolution between 2 founders?",,"My startup has 2 founders: I'm the Woz, and my cofounder is the Jobs.  We have been working under the assumption that it'll be 50/50, at least since the 3 founders that didn't do anything left.  It's seemed to work well in terms of both of us feeling like we're pulling our fair share and aren't being cheated.<p>However, we just spoke to a lawyer about incorporation and corporate structures, and he said ""That'll make for an interesting agreement for dispute resolution.""  I'm curious how other companies in this situation have handled it.  I know Apple brought in Ron Wayne as the 3rd founder to act as a tiebreaker - how did the Reddits do it?  Any other examples?",1184797257

""OpenID is an open, decentralized, free framework for user-centric digital identity.""<p>blah blah ...user centric... blah  <p>How about:  OpenID allows you to have one login for multiple sites.<p>This is the paragraph after the tagline:
""OpenID starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the Internet the same way websites do-with a URI (also called a URL or web address). Since URIs are at the very core of Web architecture, they provide a solid foundation for user-centric identity.""<p>I don't even know where to begin here.<p>This is all a long way of saying that I think the upside of supporting OpenID is very small.  It may be a brilliant idea, brilliantly excecuted but few will use it b/c it is so poorly explained.  Making users feel stupid is a bad way of getting them to use your stuff.  Open or not.

If you have to click 'login', and then spot a tiny text link that says 'login with openid', of course not many people are going to sign up with openid.<p>But if you put it right next to the register link instead, EVERYWHERE that there's a register link, and at the same size, and have the openid page explain that the user may already have an openid (from a Livejournal or AIM account, et cetera), I bet you'd see more users.",1184796715

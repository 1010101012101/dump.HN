199255,comment,198964,199243,0,0,silencio,,,"The thing about Cocoa accessibility is that Apple does that all in-house. All the universal access tools and Voiceover (the screenreader) are theirs, plus they're the ones working on Cocoa. Almost nobody else has anything like it..there are a couple of third party tools I can think of, but nothing like what comes built in. On the other hand, Windows has the support of all the big names (<i>cough</i> freedom scientific) but there's a lot more diversity in terms of development. But they have to work with Microsoft and other third party devs and it's not perfect - one example I can think of is Firefox support in Jaws, which came only when Firefox was at like version 1.5 or 2ish. It's still not as good as msie support today. I might add that Cocoa apps are pretty accessible, but Firefox in all its xul etc. glory on OS X is mostly inaccessible with voiceover.<p>And the main problem with web accessibility is that people just don't give a crap. There are plenty of ways to get a site to be fairly accessible using any of the main screenreaders and other accessibility tools out there. But it's apparently a complete waste of time and not worth the effort. Some of the biggest companies and websites are guilty of this - like Yahoo and their ""newish"" Mail webapp. Google is definitely a lot better in this aspect.<p>So no, you don't have to stop using javascript, you just have to give more of a consideration to the small percentage of potential users (depending on your audience) that may need additional tools to use your website. If it proves impossible, just create like a ""text only"" version of the site up at the top of the source but hidden, so screenreaders could read that but normal visitors won't see. But I doubt you'd have to go that far. See a site like <a href=""http://www.jkrowling.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkrowling.com/</a> for an example. I don't know why they did it the way they did, but they have the regular flash site in different languages, then the accessibility-enabled flash version, and then the text-only. I guess that covers everyone ;)<p>Mouse movement is another matter - that's actually quite personal to me because I have tremors that sometimes makes it hard to accurately do things with a mouse. But there's plenty of software and hardware devices out there for people with movement disorders. It's not as big of a problem as it is for, say, the visually disabled. Ultimately I'd have to say it's not just the accessibility tools at fault here.",1211679735

Any programmer who is put off by being asked to program needs to find another profession, period.  You should not ask someone to program during an interview, you should review the code they've submitted and make them explain it, all if it, their design choices, their idioms, naming conventions, etc.  If they can't discuss code they just wrote prior to the interview, you don't want them, but many good people don't perform well under the pressure of an interview so you won't get an accurate feel for them if they program at the interview.<p>No one but a programmer is qualified to evaluate another programmer, HR and recruiters have no place here and they'll just waste time and effort pretending to be useful, they aren't.<p>By doing the test you've already filtered out the wanna be's so you don't need phone interviews, the submitted samples should go strait to a qualified programmer, it'll take him only a few minutes to toss out any bad submissions and he'll quickly know who's worth actually interviewing and who's not.<p>Code is the only resume a good programmer needs.",1211678699
199243,comment,198964,199189,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I'm honestly asking because I don't know the answer to the following question, though it may sound facetious. Are computing assistants for handicapped people in such a sorry state that:<p>1. for those that can't see well or at all, that they can't read off the screen using not the underlying HTML source, but the current DOM and layout state to determine a reasonable way to read out the screen?<p>2. they offer no help for those people that have problems with precise mouse movement?<p>Quite frankly, the whole accessibility argument appears to be a red herring unless the state of accessibility technology is such that it is crap and is not progressive. Even properly coded Flash (much like ""proper"" XHTML with CSS layouts) is accessible to screen readers these days and has been for the past couple of versions.<p>We didn't stop building multi-level buildings to accommodate people in wheelchairs, we just added ramps and elevators. I'm not willing to stop using javascript because of crap accessibility assistants. However, I am perfectly ready and willing to to build the equivalent ramp and elevator into my javascript functionality. There is nothing fundamentally inaccessible about using javascript.

This is just geek chest-thumping, and has little mathematical justification.<p>Let's assume that your interviewers are uniformly <i>exceptionally</i> good, and have a false-negative rate of only 10% (i.e. 90% of all good applicants are accepted).<p>An interview with a good candidate is therefore a Bernoulli trial, and the outcome of an interview loop can be modeled exactly as a binomial process.  If you conduct 5 interviews, the probability of at least one interviewer saying no to a good candidate is 0.41.  If you conduct <i>fourteen</i> interviews, the probability of at least one false negative is 0.77, and the probability of at least <i>two</i> false negatives is 0.42.  In other words...you've made it twice as likely that you're going to have someone falsely reject a good candidate.<p>Meanwhile, let's assume that these unrealistically brilliant interviewers are even better at rejecting bad applicants:  they each have a false-positive rate of 5% (and therefore, a true negative rate of 95%).  If we assume a five-interviewer loop, the chance of a single false positive is 0.23.  But bumping the number of interviewers to fourteen <i>raises</i> the chance of a false-positive to 0.51!  With fourteen interviewers, the chance that one will say ""Hire"" to a bad applicant is over 50%!<p>In other words, with every interviewer you add to a loop, you raise the chances of a false-positive or (even more likely) a false negative decision.  If you have normal interviewers (i.e. people who don't have super-human discriminatory ability), the problem is even more pronounced.",1211677345

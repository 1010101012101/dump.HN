It felt like they'd built their own Unix then, despite the fact that Hurd was still not much more than some really ambitious design documents.<p>My point is, I fully appreciate the importance of the GNU work to the development of free and open-source software, especially Linux.

From the article and the video I got that he's actually <i>pro-bitcoin</i>.<p>When he said it's ""the most dangerous open source project"" he's ever seen, he meant it in a <i>creative destruction</i> kind of way, which is true. It would disrupt the financial system a lot, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing in the grand scheme of things.<p>Also, from the way this author writes the article, I get the feeling he doesn't really understand Bitcoin or its purpose. He makes it sound like it would only ever be used by evil-doers, and I don't think that's true at all. Changing the way money are used and changing the status quo is not inherently bad, even though the incumbents in most markets seem to think that when they get disrupted.

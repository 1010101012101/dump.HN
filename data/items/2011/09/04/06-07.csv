Reality can change faster than the way people play the game.<p>Traditionally, you needed (say) 100 people plus a few million in servers. Now, you need 10, and a few bucks for the VM (figures exaggerated for rhetorical reasons).<p>You needed to raise big dollars to get to a MVP. You had more dollars being put in by early investors, so they quite rightfully wanted a large slice of the pie. And a small option pool being shared by 100 ""early"" employees won't make a lot of millionaires.<p>Now, you have less money being put in (I hope), and few early employees (I assume). The investors deserve less of the pie, and the early employees can get a greater portion each.<p>But the standard employment contracts are still written (thus anchored) to 1% or less per employee.",1315119553

However, if something is available at an appropriate price point with easy access, then piracy will diminish (down to people who only think that everything should be free).<p>As far as the 'donate what you want' concept, Panera Bread has a few locations that are like this [1]. I can't remember the details, but I think that it all ended up evening out. They would give you a suggested cost, and you paid what you wanted/could.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-05-16-panera-pay-what-you-can_n.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-05-16-pan...</a>",1315116866

Even after using all the Google-fu I know, I wasn't able to find an off-the-shelf current sensor that was network or usb accessible.  I decided to build my own.  It's Arduino based with a current sensor on a separate breakout board.  I was soldering connectors on to the breakout board and accidentally left the heat on way too long.  Two tiny surface mount resistors fell off.  It took 20 minutes, but I managed to solder both of them back on.  The board even worked afterwards!<p>That was last weekend.  This weekend I now have 2 of these things built and my soldering skills have improved immensely.<p>You're smart.  You'll figure it out.",1315116525

2958907,comment,2958128,2958875,2,0,mbreese,,,"How would that work? They dynamically make a new version each time someone wants to download it from the ""official source""? Would this be the same version over the entire day? The entire week? What if I wanted to download an old episode of Seinfeld, would I get current ads, or ads from 1996? Would the ""official source"" still have to be able to upload each episode? If not, you run the risk of having multiple versions of current shows (this week's ads and last week's ads) in the wild. And you lose the ability to have people who downloaded it last week help with distribution.<p>I think that the best solution is to have a container that automatically inserts ads at the appropriate times. In this case though, the task will be making sure someone doesn't just remove the ads from the container. This is a similar problem with DVRs, but since this would all be automated, there is a greater risk.",1315116201

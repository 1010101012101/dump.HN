Yes, Lisp is a 4GL but even if everyone is rushing toward 4GL, there are plenty to choose from and it&#x27;s not clear that they will flock toward Lisp.<p>Even if CS is still pretty recent (50+ years), there is still something to be said about a language that never managed to become mainstream in that period. Whether Lisp was ahead of its time is irrelevant. The question is: will there ever be a time where Lisp will be ripe for its time?<p>I think that window closed a while ago. It&#x27;s not about the parentheses or its FP side, it&#x27;s just that the world is moving toward statically typed languages with sophisticated type inference, and it&#x27;s a league that Lisp simply doesn&#x27;t belong to.",1449115194

They also don&#x27;t have any legacy overhead tied to engineering around ICE. As we&#x27;ve seen with Tesla, they had to reinvent almost everything because most of the problems traditional car companies had been working on don&#x27;t exist in an all-electric vehicle.<p>Apple designs the buying process, which for cars is nightmare fuel for most people. Even in their normal retail stores, buying is easier, you can pick up some things off the shelf, ring it up yourself right where you&#x27;re standing with the Store app and then walk out.

Perhaps this area is an Apple weakness but another possibly is that CarPlay is to iCar as the Motorola ROKR was to the iphone.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2vfubz/i_am_one_of_the_lead_engineers_responsible_for/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2vfubz/i_am_one_of_th...</a><p>You talk about Apple&#x27;s materials being shoddy but that is not the impression I have (outside of charging cables). My iphone 3gs and 4s have held up very well and metal frame ipads, macbooks and iphones seem to do even better. Greg Koenig&#x27;s much linked post about their Watch manufacturing [2] basically said Apple is operating at the pinnacle of craftsmanship when it comes to materials, precision and finish. One quote of many possible: <i>&quot;I see a process that could only have been created by a team looking to execute on a level far beyond what was necessary or what will be noticed. This isn&#x27;t a supply chain, it is a ritual Apple is performing to bring themselves up to the standards necessary to compete against companies with centuries of experience.&quot;</i> There is plenty of room for technical gimmicks here in the auto industry and I fully expect a video of Jony Ive explaining how revolutionary it is for safety when the entire carframe is milled from a single piece of aluminum.<p>[2] <a href=""http://atomicdelights.com/blog/a-glimpse-at-how-the-apple-watch-is-made"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atomicdelights.com/blog/a-glimpse-at-how-the-apple-wa...</a>",1449113969

It&#x27;s weird to have your phone in your pocket without being able to use it.  Akin to a dead battery, but bigger.  I&#x27;d been concerned that it was going to take forever to leave the venue because we had to line up to get our phones out of the pouches, but they were also friendly and perfectly efficient on the way out.  I&#x27;d say it didn&#x27;t add any more time than getting a 21+ wristband on the way in, and even quicker while leaving.<p>The show was absolutely more enjoyable.  I don&#x27;t personally care if people check their phones and record live shows, but I absolutely despise when my view is obstructed by someone waving their device around trying to get a shot.  I&#x27;m here to watch a relatively expensive live show, not watch other people record it.<p>As a potential downside, the opening comedian hadn&#x27;t showed up, which left us sitting and watching / listening to the DJ for 2 hours before Dave Chapelle hit the stage.  The DJ did an excellent job keeping the crowd entertained, but there were a few lulls where I would have loved to pop into HN or Reddit or something since it was literally idle time.<p>Sure, there was plenty of interaction, chatting, some dancing, and other fun with people around us.  And maybe there was more than there would have been otherwise.  But I still felt a bit like I was being punished.

I think Kickstarter has great potential and has brought about numerous things, but just like any tool it&#x27;s got people who know how to use it and do well, and people who don&#x27;t and blow their foot off.<p>This goes both ways: A lot of the large kickstarters that make the news usually have gotten gobs more money than they ever thought possible from way more backers than they thought they would get. Then they&#x27;re buying offices, cars, some fancy headquarters and all this other bullshit they didn&#x27;t need.<p>Were I to do that, not one sodding penny is going anywhere that isn&#x27;t directly related to getting my backers what they paid for. I get that kickstarter isn&#x27;t a store (people love to say that) and it&#x27;s a risk, but just because the risk isn&#x27;t yours doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t mitigate it. You&#x27;re spending other people&#x27;s money for Christ&#x27;s sake.<p>By the same token, there were a lot of people who got burned on obviously fake/impossible projects but quite frankly, that falls into the category of stupid tax for me. A fool and his money are soon parted, etc. etc.<p>I do wish there were more legal routes for burned backers though, in the current system the backers are taking all the risk and if someone&#x27;s kickstarter goes tits up they just walk away, usually hardly affected (and potentially Internet famous). I understand that&#x27;s the risk involved, but it effectively puts the people in charge of decisions in charge of managing the risk taken by people they have no legal obligations too, which never goes well.

Academics need to do a fresh take on that with assessments vs particular risks & compared to current languages.<p>That&#x27;s kind of already happened. Stroustrup has done a whole ton of work in that area with Concepts.<p>> Meanwhile, most in safety-critical development that I know of don&#x27;t use C++ because it&#x27;s too complex and unsafe per them.<p>It turns out that provable correctness invariably involves a fair bit of complexity (you are basically compiling a mathematical proof). People use Haskell and Coq to really do it right, and --surprise-- those turn out to be hard for programmers to learn.<p>A lot of other, more popular, high level languages are actually terrible for provable correctness, even if they are better for proving memory safety. C++ isn&#x27;t as effective for the job, but it has the advantage of being great for integrating in with the platform. It is a trade off, but one that is well worth while.<p>> So, do you have any resources showing that C++ code is safe and analysable if one just uses smart pointers?<p>This stuff goes back a way, but stemmed from Modern C++ Design. There is a whole world of policy based design where you use the type system (much as with Haskell and Coq) to enforce declarative policies.<p>The quick thought experiment would be something like this:<p><pre><code>    template <class T>\n    struct SafeRef {\n        void check() { ... }\n        operator T&() { check(); return *x; }\n        operator const T&() const { check(); return *x; }\n    private:\n        T* x;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nYou can override operator-> to make it behave more like a proper pointer.

Many images are screen shots from SW installs. Workflow goes: Run SW in VM-> screenshot portion of interest -> Copy+Paste into word doc. I never even save the image in that case. The rest of the images are photos of HW. I just want to drag and drop into the document, not rename them all and move them to a same folder with the document. The document/CMS/program should take care of that all for me (like Word does).<p>2) I do need the text and images to match better and be more WYSIWYG. Location is more important than aesthetics for a guide.  It cannot be the abomination that LaTeX is. LaTeX figures are terrible to work with (and that&#x27;s having published multiple academic papers + PhD thesis in LaTeX). Sizing is less important (that can be [width=x, height=y]).<p>3) Variables/snippets: Libraries of text snippets and variables is what we do quite a bit of.

For projects that think terms of N thousands of transactions per second, the math breaks down real badly.  It would cost approximately  $2,500 dollars to run a 100ms job a billion times in a month on a machine with only 1.5GB of allocated to this process.  You could pay $4350 per year w/ reserved pricing (is there even reserved pricing w/ Lambda? Couldn&#x27;t find it.) for a c3.4xlarge, which has 30 gigs of memory and 16 cores, which could easily process many more times work than a billion 100ms jobs per month.  So lambda seemingly works out well over 6x more than rolling it yourself on EC2 with my overly conservative napkin math.<p>The other pain point these type of systems produce is that instead of scaling a server here or a few servers there, your thinking in terms of processes, and time and time again this becomes a very rapid way to not only provision more horsepower instantly, but also run up the bill instantly.  Code that might have ran on 1000 processes on traditional infrastructure because you had to tune it to fit in that infrastructure  (and I don&#x27;t mean fine tuned, things like, setting your database pool correctly and having basic concurrency), can accidentally be scaled up to 10,000 processes and appear that everything is fine.  Unfortunately have seen this quite a bit on GAE and lead to some very costly mistakes.<p>Processes are harder (in my humble opinion) to have a good feel for what costs what, especially if your scaling up rapidly. Instead of adding a few servers and understanding how that effects the bill, going from 1000 to 1500 processes happens much easier, and you pay for that convenience.<p>My .02 is that this would be ideal if your either in a hurry and money is no object, or you don&#x27;t plan on growing past a certain size, or possibly for workloads that are truly not running that often.  I think this whole craze of lets replace everything with lambda is going to lead to rapid development (awesome) at high prices if your project takes off, which will leave developers rushing to get off of it if/when their project needs to scale with financial constraints.

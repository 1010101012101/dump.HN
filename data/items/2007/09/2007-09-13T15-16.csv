Especially in a theater.  If an ad on TV bothers you, you can turn off the sound or go into the next room.  If an ad in a newspaper or magazine bothers you, you can cover it or turn the page.  But an ad in a theater you are getting shoved in your face no matter what.<p>Ads have a cost.  People who think they can keep sticking more and more ads on things don't realize that they're gradually making whatever it is less attractive.  But eventually you cross a line.",1189699068

Most importantly that analyst firms like Gartner can be dead wrong with their ""predictions"" of the future.

While there are exceptions, Asian culture is about obeying and following either your parents, your teacher, your government, or whoever else is above you (your boss). <p>It's so strong that even some American Asians today are trapped by it (fortunately not many to my knowledge). I actually experienced this when I first moved to the SF bay area. My gf (now wife)'s adherrence to her parent's wishes (even though she didn't agree with them) nearly drove me insane... even though I'm Asian myself, I guess I just can't relate anymore to certain aspects of our culture since I grew up where there were virtually no other Asians....",1189696759

It doesn't mean that Global Warming isn't really a problem but there might not be anything we can do about it except plan for life afterward. Even if it is man made do you really think a few light bulbs and hybrids are going to make any difference? You can't stop Global Warming at this point, no matter what the cause is.",1189696321

To start with a analogy, at some point the gravitational force was understood as a instantaneous action over some distance, nowadays it is understood as curvature of the space-time. So if you say that &#x27;the fields are real,&#x27; then you implicitly claim that they are fields. And as our understanding evolves, perhaps we will call them something else entirely, we may not even describe them as fields anymore than today gravity is described as a action at a distance.<p>So you may argue, that this is just semantics. But semantics become important, when you have a theory which predicts that the fundamental particles of the theory can not be observed in isolation. If the only thing that you actually observe is the response of a 100-ton detector, and where you heavily post process the data you gain from observing the detector.",1382183625

The majority* of people on HN seem to have no clue how TV and Film is actually paid for, how the content ecosystem itself works. They just see the end product.<p>To flip the tables a bit, here is the same logic being applied to tech, instead of TV/Film:<p>First, lets get rid of these incubators, angels, VCs, and IPOs pumping money into the system up front. Surely, the $30 million spent to start Foobr.com could easily be paid by the users, right?<p>Second, instead...sell time on Foobr.com at $2.99/day a la carte. Multiple by the 1 million users that the $30 million pre-funded Foobr.com has today, and Boom! Foobr.com can <i>clearly</i> exist (in the same form, too!) if we got rid of incubators, VCs, IPOs, aquihires, and all the rest.<p>Third, gloat on HN, in blogs, podcasts, and on Twitter. It&#x27;s math, dude! Bask in my brilliant economic analysis of the startup ecosystem. You people working at Ycombinator and VCs, and buying stock at IPOs? Chumps, all of you!

Idiots.<p>----<p>This analogy (if you don&#x27;t know TV and Film is funded) is much stronger than you&#x27;d think. It&#x27;s amazing how similar the two are in terms of funding.<p>And hopefully everyone can agree that removing literally <i>all</i> of the up front funding channels for tech startups, and instead moving to a la carte pricing on the final product, is not a workable plan. The same is true of TV and Film. You cannot simply move it to a la carte pricing and expect the exact same things to be available, and at the same quality level.<p>There are very strong reasons why the Film/TV ecosystem is the way it is that are not immediately obvious to people outside of it.

In fact there are zillions of gluons, antiquarks, and quarks in a proton.   The standard shorthand, the proton is made from two up quarks and one down quark, is really a statement that the proton has two more up quarks than up antiquarks, and one more down quark than down antiquarks.   To make the glib shorthand correct you need to add the phrase plus zillions of gluons and zillions of quark-antiquark pairs.

Of course, you will need to have a convincing history to back you up.<p>For example, a friend of mine markets himself as basically a part-time CTO. He&#x27;s been there, done that at a number of startups over the years, team lead the last few, a strong record of delivery. Management (who are not or only partially technical) does not hire him for his programming skills - that is not even a question at the (short, single) interview. He develops software, yes, but the main priority is giving management confidence that their software story is in safe, experienced hands, gives them someone to interface with, and frees up their bandwidth for other concerns. This guy makes well over six figures working part time.<p>It&#x27;s no secret that many startup founders come from finance - and despite their bad rap here on HN, mostly they are very smart, decent people. But they don&#x27;t know tech like we do. What are their needs? What are their fears?<p>They&#x27;re not looking for the cheapest typist in town. They&#x27;re looking for a credible partner to take co-ownership of the tech side of things. Maybe that&#x27;s taking co-ownership of the mobile product, or something more inclusive, it doesn&#x27;t matter - they just don&#x27;t want to have to worry about it. So be that person who can take care of that for them.<p>And one more thing. There is a bizarre tendency in the software world to eschew anything that smells like management, and to almost revel in the fact that IT people can often get away with dressing down at work. Don&#x27;t do that. Always wear a suit, or at least a shirt. Business has rules, and the dress code is one of them. Demonstrate at the very first impression that you understand this, and you will gain a <i>lot</i> of respect.

But it could still be mined much like Bitcoin, with the difference being that the total amount will never be limited. Also, it should be easier to mine them, since the (non-finite) total (1 trillion) would be a lot larger than the 21 limit for Bitcoins. Someone should also do the math for this new currency&#x27;s adoption rate, so all of the 1 trillion units (adjusted with the 2 percent inflation rate) get distributed in 3-5 decades.<p>Basically we don&#x27;t want a few thousand people to get that whole trillion within 10 years.

1) Atleast for restaurent business, this model makes sense as nobody goes to the same restaurent every day. Buy keeping him in a closed partner network, you are enhancing the chance to get him back again.<p>2) This will also encourage customers to go out and try new places<p>3) This will work out great for new business<p>4) some extra revenue for more established players.<p>Challenges : Identifying complementing business is going to be a big pain. Also the revenue sharing is going to be a pain too.<p>Other thoughts: We could manage all the coupons and deals online so no business will feel the extra pain. We could make the consumer scans the bill using a app and that could be used to get deals/coupons. Soo many ways we could implement it to make it painless.<p>Another thing is that, it will change the way we look at a business. Rather than one single entity, over a period of time, we will have a partner group of business we trust.

Monitis nodes across the US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America monitor clients key IT processes every 60 seconds  offering fast and frequent checks, as well as alert notifications into the health of servers, networks, applications, events, cloud storage facilities, cloud platforms, websites, transactions and other processes.<p>We have been using Monitis service for more than one year now, said Oliver Kuchendorf from Internet-Arts.  It is very economical, easy to set up and start using.  Most importantly, it provides us a proactive way of detecting performance issues with the web sites we monitor, so we can provide high quality and uninterrupted service to our customers.  We are very excited about Monitis adding a new node in Brazil.  It shows commitment to businesses in our country, enabling us to detect and fix web site performance issues that our Brazilian customers may be experiencing even more accurately and quickly.<p>The addition of a new monitoring node in Brazil will enable us to expand our level of service to businesses with customers in Brazil, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. What really sets us apart from the competition is the frequency of monitoring. If a typical service offers monitoring once a minute from 100 nodes, in reality it means each node is activated every 100 minutes. In the current business environment, companies cant afford such delays before discovering slowdowns or disruptions at a particular destination. With Monitis service, customers may choose one-minute monitoring intervals from all our monitoring locations simultaneously.<p>In addition to offering clients a global network of monitoring stations, Monitis also enables IT managers to create their own customized monitoring locations using a small footprint agent.<p>As more companies come to rely on proactive monitoring and instant notifications of IT problems, Monitis is committed to continuously expanding the network of monitoring nodes and raising the service bar higher, added Avoyan.<p>The new monitoring location is provided by Ananke.<p>You can try Monitis service for free by signing up at https://www.monitis.com/free_signup.jsp<p>About Monitis

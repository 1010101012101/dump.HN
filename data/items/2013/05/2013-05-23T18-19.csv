It does depends on your readership, the topics you discuss and the popularity of your blog. If you find too many of your comments to be rude, or that you're overwhelmed by the sheer number then, sure, consider turning comments off.<p>However, many blogs don't attract comments in their hundreds. For me, disabling comments would feel like saying to blog readers that I'm not interested in what they think about my blog post (and I am). You might write for yourself as you compose posts, but when you publish your post you want others to read it. Are there blog authors who can honestly say they aren't interested in the views of their readers about what they've written?<p>I would rather a conversation take place on my blog than telling users to take the discussion elsewhere. (You can't really discuss things in a 140 character tweet).<p>Related to this discussion is another viewpoint about getting rid of social media buttons

Now you've got a list of every part of the data model referenced by this template. Unfortunately this doesn't give you byte ranges for each reference, but that could be changed.<p>Angular propagates changes to your data model to only the parts of the DOM that depend on it, which is cool. Imagine if you could do the same against a nunjucks template. Given the above kind of dependency analysis, I don't see why not.<p>Maybe rendering snippets of a jinja template at runtime is problematic?<p>Aside: yikes on the string-based codegen here...I bet you wish you were still writing scheme ;)<p><a href=""https://github.com/jlongster/nunjucks/blob/master/src/compiler.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jlongster/nunjucks/blob/master/src/compil...</a>",1369335580

As a human, a good manager wants to assure them that s/he values their contribution, blah blah, but all they hear is what is said in the first 30 seconds.  Hit the high points  we are laying you off, you are getting n weeks/months/years of severance, here is all of this in writing, plus your benefits package and final check, do you have any questions?<p>It's also very unlikely that the manager had much say other than in terms of force ranking people (if that).  I found out at 9pm the night before that I would have to cut more people than planned.<p>Your boss may have been thinking something along the lines of,""20% of our company just lost their jobs and you're worried about the free chair massages???"" because their brain is still in the context of not only ""I can't protect my team,"" but also ""I had an active role in their termination.""  They're often in the ""bargaining"" phase of grief and thinkin,""without x, I could have kept one person,"" or ""One of my leads could do my job with this new team size, so my leaving will save 2-5 jobs in the next round.""  Those things go through your manager's head.<p>The best a manager can do is to take the ""survivors"" away from the office (conference room in another building, on a walk to a local park, whatever) while people have the opportunity to pack their personal effects.  Tell the team everything you can about why the layoff took place, who was affected, and get as much of the bad shit out that you can.<p>They'll rant at their managers, they'll rant at the company, and the managers have to take it.  Try to avoid the company party line and give people as realistic a view as possible of what is happening and what will likely happen.  Try to bring in the highest execs possible to answer questions, because a manager may or may not know, or be able to tell, some details about the financial forces driving the decisions.<p>TL;DR - It sucks for everyone, including your manager, so s/he may be crankier than normal.  Extend compassion their way as well.  If you're a manager, see the blowback coming and get in front of it and be genuine.",1369335489

5758531,comment,5756142,5758258,2,0,vivin,,,"> Lecturing from a book, or from notes, is sometimes the right thing to do,<p>I don't see how this can ever be useful. I grew up in the Middle East and attended an Indian School which followed the CBSE syllabus. There was nothing in the syllabus per se that inspired me to ask why. That came from my innate interest and from the occasional teacher who went beyond what was taught.<p>The focus was on rote memorization. You could be assured of excellent marks if you simply regurgitated what was in the text book. So if you were a moron, but had great memory, you could get 90%+ on an exam, but did you actually <i>know</i> anything?<p>In high school, I loved math but I never did well in the exams because I didn't really understand what I was applying and why. My high school teachers told me that I would do better in a western system of education that focused more on application than rote memorization. This was borne true a few years later when I started my undegrad in the US and aced my math classes. Although to be fair, my previous exposure to higher math definitely helped. But what I gained most from my education in the US was that I knew <i>why</i> I was doing <i>what</i> I was doing.<p>> The US system seems to overemphasize understanding.<p>I fail to see how anyone can overemphasize understanding. Understanding is the point of learning something. I still remember one of my friends <i>memorizing</i> Physics derivations. I once tried to ask her to explain one particular step and she had no clue why it was being done. She had simply memorized it. I sucked at that; I cannot memorize anything if I do not <i>understand</i> it<p>> That's biased. How can you challenge the intellect and question paradigms if you don't know them in the first place?<p>He's talking about the paradigm of rote memorization and conformity. In school I was frequently docked points if I restated my answer in any form that was different from the text book. It didn't matter that what I was saying was essentially the same. I didn't use the language of the book and so it was ""wrong"". How does that teach anyone anything? I still remember being terribly frustrated because I <i>knew</i> that my answer was right but yet I was being penalized because I hadn't regurgitated what was in the book.<p>Rote memorization may be helpful, but it cannot be the central underpinning of any kind of educational system. The idea of education is to <i>understand</i> what is being taught and <i>apply</i> it. Not just to memorize and regurgitate it without any regard for the meaning. Otherwise you're not better than a parrot that repeats phrases without any idea of the meaning or context.",1369333640

I mean, it makes at one point the claim that Android manufacturers are sacrificing margin for marketshare (which is no doubt true; its a common strategy, one which Amazon's Jeff Bezos has highlighted with the comment that ""Your competitor's margin is your opportunity""), suggesting that while the trend is against Apple in marketshare, Apple could easily reverse it by cutting its own margins.<p>But then the article goes on to say Apple shouldn't cut the prices on its offerings because not enough is known about price elasticity in this market (well, specifically, they say not enough is known about price elasticity of the iPhone).<p>And then they make the claim that the goal is not to maximize marketshare (okay), or even to maximize profits (!), but to <i>maximize the ratio of profits to marketshare</i>. By that logic, in a two-player market where one player has 99.9% of the marketshare and a mere 99% of the profits, and the other player has 0.1% of the marketshare but a whopping 1% of the profits, the <i>latter</i> would be <i>winning</i>.",1369333550

That's certainly doable when the range of the car is ~80 miles per day.<p>For the car to be 'free' you would certainly need to be driving it that many miles per day. Say I drive a pickup that gets 15 MPG. If I drive 1,000 miles per month (I don't, but that's the amount generally allowed for a leased vehicle -- 12,000 miles per year), and if those 1,000 miles can be driven in the Spark, then I'm buying ~67 less gallons of gas per month. At $3/gallon, I'm saving $200 per month in gas, and at $4/gallon I'm saving $268 per month in gas. The money I'm saving on gas for my pickup pays for the Spark. We shouldn't forget the $999 down payment, but over three years that's just under $28/month. And then there's the cost of electricity. There's an annual fuel cost of $400, or $33 per month (based on $.12 per kW-hr and 12,000 miles--however, where I live that's going to be about $10 cheaper per month, but I'll use the $33 for these calculations).<p>My cost: $199 + $28 + $33 = $260/month<p>My savings: $268/month (at $4/gallon of gas).<p>I only drive my pickup around 8,000 miles per year, which is ~45 gallons of gas per month. So my savings are only $180/month at $4/gallon of gas, making the cost of the Spark ~$80/month, or $2880 for the 3 year lease.<p>At this point I can work over the numbers even further so that car is even cheaper saying that over half of my miles can be deducted for business, saving me over $800/year in federal income tax. That brings me down to around $14/month, or $504 for the 3 year lease.",1369333178

If it is, I'm personally ready for something new.<p>I'd argue that the 'maturity' rhetoric expresses something different. The point behind Morozov's (and others') criticism is that difficult social/policy issues cannot be solved through individual citizen/consumer action alone. I think the main criticism is that silicon valley often acts from within isolation. 'Disrupting' consumer behavior is not enough to drive social or political change in many cases.<p>The arrogance that people speak of when they refer to silicon valley is one of ambition. People in the valley envision replacing traditional law-making with crowdsourcing, but forging public policy is far too difficult for a solution that simple.<p>To those who make these criticisms, the stereotypical startup founder claiming that their product will cause meaningful social and/or political change is naive. They also make the claim that such a 'solutionist' approach will often worsen, not better, the problems that such a product addresses.<p>The fact that a handful of technology leaders are attempting to work with the existing political infrastructure reflects a newfound maturity in the culture - one of collaboration and modesty. Where previous technologists looked at the existing infrastructure, muttered ""we can do better"", and failed, these people are simply trying to say ""we can help"".",1369332209

There's been medical records keeping software that's better than paper for 30 years now, but a lot of hospitals still use filing cabinets full of handwritten charts.<p>Switching systems for a major enterprise is hugely expensive.  In addition to retooling and retraining, there's the cost of paying someone the often thousands of hours to import all the existing records.  Plus six months (optimistically) of dealing with lost records, transcription errors, and learning curve errors from staff unfamiliar with the inevitable quirks of the new system.

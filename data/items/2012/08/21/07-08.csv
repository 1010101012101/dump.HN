4411621,comment,4411099,4411099,9,0,confluence,,,"Let me get this out right now: Valuations mean jack shit (companies/houses/startups/humans - whatever). Especially ""market caps"".<p>Understand this:<p>21.91 million shares of Apple were traded yesterday. That is $14,460,600,000 moving around. [1]<p>Now you must adjust down for HFT traders, market makers, option hedgers, futures guys and anyone else who trades massive amounts of stock each and every day. My rule of thumb is ~10% actually moves hands (rather than just being moved around).<p>So now we are at $1,460,600,000. Only $1.5 billion dollars actually moved around yesterday. If you had $1.5 billion dollars yesterday you could've controlled the ""market cap/valuation"" of 1 billion shares and half a trillion in value.<p>You can control the market cap of anything utilising the fact that valuation uses multiplicative leverage on stuff that doesn't exist yet. [2][3] Indeed - all those teengers you see in college at age 11? Way overvalued - come and check back in 10 years. Fallacy of exponential growth runs rampant through most of finance, and teenage ""prodigies"". [4]<p>Basically with only $1.5 billion you could control the value of $500 billion dollars worth of assets - on any one day - that's it. This is how you get bubbles. This is how you can have stock market booms and busts.<p>Valuation leverage allows you to bid up prices for any stock using less than 2% in actual value, selling to the next tulip buyer whenever they come in trading. [5] If you had to use 100% cash - well there just ain't enough to go around my friends!<p>Startups?<p>Invest $20K just like YC does, valuing a company at $1 million - pre-product and sometimes even pre-team! The million dollars just ain't there yet - but everybody - look yonder - valuation and investor interest over the horizon!<p>Venture Funds?<p>Instagram received a $50 million cash injection which valued it at a cool $500+ million - pre-revenue. $500 million in cash wasn't actually in the coffers (or on the horizon) but Facebook look - just look - at our valuation/predicted growth - you gotta buy us out (with cash of course). And double the price while you're at it.<p>~2% of the world's value actually exchanged hands yesterday on the world markets.<p>~0.5% of market participants actually moved the prices that the rest of the world was priced at.<p>Hold ~2% of the world - and control it all.<p>Valuation is bullshit - it's like leverage without the cost of capital.<p>Sources:<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=NASDAQ:AAPL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=NASDAQ:AAPL</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://xkcd.com/605/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/605/</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization</a>",1345535773

For anecdotal examples, see GFS, MapReduce, and Dynamo; there are many unpublished/trade-secret examples that will take years to come out.<p>Additionally, many schools have reduced their requirements for what exposure students should have to systems and OS:<p>A Harvard CS concentrator, for example, is not required to take either the introductory systems or operating systems classes; he/she may opt to take a high-level mobile programming class instead. Indeed, the operating systems and distributed systems courses are taught every other year, further reducing enrollment. The last time CS 161 (intro OS) was taught, there were only 23 students. 25 in CS 153 (Compilers). This is a stark contrast to the 100-200 students who took other upper-level CS classes (189 in mobile, for example).<p>While I will not contest the value of the formal CS education, I see some of the 'naive'(for lack of a better term) CS proliferating even there.",1345534040

I think the term is extraordinarily difficult to define, so a good start is removing it from easy conflators.<p>My gut response is that it's the 'thinking about thinking' or being able to think in a 'meta' fashion that makes up self-awareness. That you can observe your own actions from a hypothetical third person view. Animal minds are of course a black box - dogs could theoretically be far more intelligent than the smartest humans, but it may just be that their brains don't allow them to express themselves appropriately. As they're a black box, we're reduced to things like the mirror test to try and approximate an idea.<p>Ultimately I think the real answer will be that consciousness/self-awareness is not a binary thing, but a sliding scale. I think the biggest block in discussing these concepts is the next link in the chain: the unwritten assumption that once something is 'conscious', it has a 'soul' or 'special essence' of some kind and therefore can't be morally farmed/eaten/whathaveyou. Because the label of 'conscious' carries this weight, it becomes a sacred label we have to be cautious about applying. An interesting paradox, in that scientific observation might suggest other animals are capable of consciousness, but there is no scientific evidence to suggest that consciousness is particularly special in a moral sense, yet the latter is largely taken for granted.",1345532787

But I certainly know a few programmers who do not dare to think beyond what their IDE allows them to do. They use built-in wizards and refactorings, but they do not seek solutions that are not easily expressible with those.<p>Hence, their code is factored just the way the IDE would, even if there are better alternatives available. This is the kind of mediocrity I am talking about. (And by the way, you could go much worse than Eclipse at that)<p>I actually had quite a few discussions where the main misunderstanding was that we used different tools and thus thought of different things as ""easy"" or ""natural"". In one case, one developer argued that it would be a good idea to create a whole bunch of classes to encapsulate a problem space. However, creating all these classes really would not have been necessary at all, he could have accomplished the same goal with a much simpler list of functions. Thus, we ended up with a HUGE file containing some several dozen classes that no-one but him could navigate, because it was factored just right for his programming editor but was all but unusable for anyone else.<p>One developer even told me that he did not know how to write a correct if statement in C because his editor had a template for that. What my argument boils down to is that this kind of behavior is bad, and I have seen it becoming a sad kind of sub-culture in Eclipse/Java land.<p>That said, I completely agree that if used correctly, there is nothing inherently wrong with Eclipse or Java per se.",1345532543

I made the app so that you can organize your todos into projects (so more of a pm app), and invite others to work with you on projects. What I could try and do is just set it up so you're logged into a test account by default to poke around.<p>I'll let you know when I've taken care of that. Thanks for showing interest!",1345532464

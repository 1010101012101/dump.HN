You&#x27;ll want to know SQL inside and out, too.<p>If you don&#x27;t know ruby or JS yet, I&#x27;d recommend just learning JS and using node for your backends with express.js. Node is pretty easy/awesome, don&#x27;t listen to the neckbeards.<p>Don&#x27;t waste your time learning brainfuck or whatever if you want to work in industry building applications. Although things like that are cool, it&#x27;s never going to have a higher priority than the million other important things you need to learn right now.

That just seems highly ignorant of the relative merits of each database.<p>And similarly, the attitude that a RDBMS is the right and proper data store, that all data should rightly prefer to live in an RDBMS aside from the loftiest heights of scalability.<p>Finally, the assertion that using a key-value or column-based datastore is going to lead to an &quot;unnecessarily complex&quot; design.<p>I&#x27;d not be surprised to find you disagree, but if we were working together on the same team, these are some things I&#x27;d try to work with you on.",1374717523

My gut instinct would be to check with the event organizers first before trying to bring a +1, but I think the OP assumed that because he was able to negotiate with the travel coordinators for two one way tickets, one for his wife (instead of one round trip ticket), he probably assumed that this was implicit consent for his wife to tag along at the conference.  Seems like a big mis-understanding that was confounded by poor treatment from security staff (and before we start ragging on the security staff, it is worth mentioning that event security tends to be a thankless, miserable job.  Crappy wages and hours, and depending on the event, you spend most of your time dealing with people who treat you like shit.)",1374717453

CS101-type classes in the universities and colleges I&#x27;ve been around fail a good part of each class. If Jane Margolis and Lenore Blum&#x27;s work on women in Computer Science is to be believed, those classes might actually be too harsh of a filter (not due to rigor but rather the imposing and overbearing influence of those of us who learned programming when we were kids).

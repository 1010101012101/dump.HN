We need to work together as a community, so for it to work there has to be a set of rules. You can see the same with packs of lions or other types of animals.<p>Anti-social elements will not survive long on their own. People/animals who work together has a better chance of survival. Those who can't work with others, are therefore removed (gradually) from the gene pool.<p>Anyway, it is very dangerous to base morals on religion. Only religion can make someone say ""It's wrong to kill people, unless they believe in another religion""... What is the moral basis for that? If you removed religion from politics, they would not be able to say that.",1239522704

Therefore, an algorithm that can tell whether an arbitrary piece of code will produce valid search trees can tell whether that piece of code will halt.<p>This isn't really a good example though, because it's quite possible to examing an arbitrary piece of code and, <i>assuming it halts</i>, determine whether it will produce valid search trees.  The Haskell and ML typecheckers are existence proofs for this, as is the static typechecker that Wadler did as a bolt-on addition to Erlang.",1239522112

558262,comment,558034,558131,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's a fairly obvious explanation that I didn't see mentioned anywhere in the abstract: assortative mating.  People tend to have sex with people of roughly the same intelligence, socioeconomic status, and interests.  As you go down the tails of the bell curve, there are fewer people of the same intelligence with similar interests.<p>If you have an IQ of 100, 68% of the population is within one standard deviation of you.  Your chances of meeting someone you feel comfortable with in high school are pretty high.  But if you have an IQ of 145 (3 stddev), only about 3% of the population is within one standard deviation of intelligence of you.  Add to that the constraints of it being a member of your preferred sex, being reasonably attractive & socially compatible, and wanting to have sex, and it's no surprise that most such people don't find suitable mates until they enter college, which purposely brings together people of similar intelligence.<p>And if you have an IQ of 175 (5 stddev), less than 1 in 10,000 people is within one standard deviation of intelligence.  (Though this is a bit meaningless, as IQ distribution has fat tails when you get past about 145.)  Then add in that super-intelligent people often have very narrow and deep interests, and that males are overrepresented on both ends of the bell curve (there are both more male morons and male geniuses than female ones).<p>This also explains why the smartest men were most likely to hire a prostitute.  If they had no chance of forming an emotional connection with a woman, why not pay her to leave afterwards?<p>Personally, I had about zero interest in 90% of girls in college.  They were just inane.  And this is at Amherst, which already selects for pretty smart people.",1239521050

558259,comment,558134,558199,0,0,Zak,,,"I don't think that's quite it. The author seems to like languages that let programs be as close to provably correct as possible. He also admits that, for some problems, this is a mistake.<p>I used to hate static typing with a passion, and I'm still a pretty big Lisp fan, but I've recently taken up Haskell. Many of the examples in this post use Haskell as an example of the right thing, and I'm really starting to see the advantages. Certain common errors are caught by the compiler, and impure operations show up in a function's type signature, reducing the chances of any spooky action at a distance.<p>Ultimately, I think there's a tradeoff between flexibility and correctness. How much of each to choose depends on the parameters of the project. Some languages try to allow a choice, especially with regard to typing discipline. Haskell offers Data.Dynamic. Common Lisp has optional type declarations and compiler warnings for obvious type errors. There's a post about formalizing such things as ""gradual typing"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=556794"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=556794</a>).",1239520807

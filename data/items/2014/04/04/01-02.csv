And considering the Government is the embodiment of and the centralized authority for our society, it very much should be at the center of marriage.<p>A &quot;marriage&quot; is a multifaceted social institution that has civil/economic implications (first and foremost) and cultural implications as varied as the number of people on the planet. To state that it is only a religious institution is incredibly myopic to it&#x27;s history and evolution in human society.<p>That all said, we pretty much have the same view, but I propose a slightly different solution: drop one of the terms entirely. There is no reason to differentiate between civil unions and marriage. They are legally the exact same thing - no reason to have two terms for it.<p>I would say we drop &quot;civil unions&quot; and stick with &quot;marriage&quot;, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.",1396576673

It&#x27;s worth noting that there&#x27;s a constant barrage of people trying to send varying degrees of spam.  It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s An Attack all of a Sudden - just occasionally people close to the HN social network happen to be targeted by something and it&#x27;s magnified by the media / hive mind local to us.<p>> shouldn&#x27;t Twitter be able to pick these messages up automatically fairly fast<p>Theoretically, sure.  As a human looking at an attack, it&#x27;s usually pretty easy to pick out &quot;obvious&quot; attributes that they should have been able to catch.  But when you&#x27;re operating at a scale like us or Twitter, even stuff that looks like it&#x27;s obviously-indicative-of-badness often has false-positives (posts flagged as spam that are not).  The long tail of weird stuff that a billion users do can be pretty crazy.<p>At the same time, the &quot;obvious&quot; attributes of an attack are often very cheap for an attacker to change.  Instead, we try to go after more expensive resources (domains, source IPs, etc).<p>> after (I assume) hundreds if not thousands of users have flagged them<p>Sadly, looking at flags of content is not a silver bullet. The signal is very sparse (a given spam post is rarely flagged), and nonspam posts are frequently flagged (religious and political speech are great examples - and they are the worst kind of false positive if you delete them as spam).  These problems can be somewhat mitigated if you aggregate flags over a dimension that&#x27;s expensive for the attacker (domain-posted, IP that posted the content, text shingles), but even then the recall isn&#x27;t necessarily great and you could still catch e.g. controversial political domains.<p>> the spammers can&#x27;t have unlimited IPs<p>True, though you can rent space on a botnet that has many, geographically-diverse, real-user IPs.  Also, I imagine a significant chunk of posts to Twitter come from apps, many of which each use a single IP to post tons of content.<p>> Is there a reason the same techniques used in E-Mail aren&#x27;t applicable to Twitter?<p>There&#x27;s definitely some overlap.  I&#x27;m not an expert at email anti-spam, but in general it&#x27;s a relatively different problem.  &quot;Traditional&quot; email spam is sent from some random email address on / via a compromised machine or open relay, and seems to be a relatively-well-solved.  But it sounds like this twitter attack was caused by compromised accounts.  At least anecdotally, it seems that email vendors are also not great at detecting this kind of attack.  For example, my gmail account (with arguably the best spam protection in the industry?) gets a message every few weeks from some compromised friend&#x27;s account. (i.e. someone had their email password stolen and the attacker is using it to &quot;legitimately&quot; send mail after authenticating to that email service with the correct password).",1396574476

When I worked there ten years ago, there were plenty who did.  When I wrote interop papers as an outside consultant in 2007, I worked with a unit that did.<p>But Microsoft also has a bunch of real problems that make it hard for them to realize this value, and so their options in going into it are somewhat limited.  They can&#x27;t pivot and become a services company because their whole Microsoft Partner network would be turned upside down.  So they enter services in some key areas where their partners can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a very delicate process, and it means for many on the administration side, the value of open source software <i>for Microsoft</i> is not as high as it would be for some other firms.<p>Nonetheless this is huge.  Open sourcing the VB.net/C# compiler effectively means the possibility of an Linux port, which means that .net has the possibility to become write once, run anywhere even if the whole class libraries are not open sourced yet.  This is a gamble for Microsoft because it reduces the barriers to moving from Windows to other platforms (Linux, OSX, BSD, etc).",1396573931

Really?<p>See the following from the NYTimes article &quot;Capital Gains, Ordinary Income and Shades of Gray&quot;:<p>&quot;Consider five examples, and see if you can identify what is ordinary income and what is a capital gain:<p> Abe buys a vacation home for his family for $800,000. Some years later, when his children have grown and left home, he sells it for $1 million. He makes $200,000.<p> Bob is a real estate investor. After scouring the market for the best investment opportunities, he buys a house for $800,000 that he believes is undervalued. A few years later, he sells it at $1 million, for a profit of $200,000.<p> Carl is a real estate investor and a carpenter. He buys a dilapidated house for $800,000. After spending his weekends fixing it up, he sells it a couple of years later for $1 million. Once again, the profit is $200,000.<p> Dan is a real estate investor and a carpenter, but he is short of capital. He approaches his friend, Ms. Moneybags, and they become partners. Together, they buy a dilapidated house for $800,000 and sell it later for $1 million. She puts up the money, and he spends his weekends fixing up the house. They divide the $200,000 profit equally.<p> Earl is a carpenter. Ms. Moneybags buys a dilapidated house for $800,000 and hires Earl to fix it up. After paying Earl $100,000 for his services, Ms. Moneybags sells the home for $1 million, for a profit of $100,000.<p>How much capital gains and ordinary income do we attribute to Abe, Bob, Carl, Dan and Earl? (To keep things simple, assume that Ms. Moneybags is untaxed. Think of her as running a pension fund or university endowment.)&quot;<p>As for accelerated depreciation of corporate jets. Are you saying we should not allow accelerated depreciation of corporate assets? Or just corporate jets? I&#x27;m sure the Fedex/UPS have some pretty valid reasons to accelerate depreciation on their 747-800s. Oh, you must mean corporate jets like the Bombardier LearJet 85. What if it&#x27;s used to haul people to remote oil fields, or do you think geologists and oil engineers should only fly commercial? If they charter the jet, why shouldn&#x27;t the charter company be able to depreciate this asset?<p>You sound like someone who&#x27;s just complaining about &quot;the rich&quot; without knowing a thing about accounting or taxes. Otherwise you&#x27;d have never called these two items &quot;indefensible&quot;.",1381762646

Mainstream economics exists to do nothing more than justify the  behaviour of politicians with the veneer of science. Keynesianism/Chicago school is simply not descriptive of reality, and when viewed through the lens of proper economics, is actually the transfer mechanism of wealth from the lower to upper classes: &quot;Look, our best economists say we need to keep acting irresponsibly which just happens to enrich our wealthy benefactors!&quot; Krugman is the highly decorated king of these idiot keynesians.<p>Austrian economic theory is much more descriptive of reality (although probably not fully descriptive), and yet is cast as voodoo science because if followed correctly there&#x27;s no opportunity to steal from us through debt and inflation: Government debt is bad, expansionary monetary policy is bad, most economic interventions will lead to unintended consequences worse than the original problem.<p>When I talk to young economics graduates, many have never even HEARD of Austrian economic theory, let alone studied it in college. At some point in the future, this era will be looked back upon as a dark time in economics in the same way that the medical profession now looks back at seemingly valid theories at the time of &quot;bad humors&quot; causing disease.

6547517,comment,6547175,6547175,18,0,Ovid,,,"This is probably one of the hardest things for many companies to grasp today. One of the things I do for a living is give full-day presentations to companies looking at Agile from a &quot;strategic&quot; position. In short, companies often do agile development, but they still lay down hard deadlines, micro-manage projects, and provide command-and-control rather than support-and-deliver.  This problem is the elephant in the room of agile: what do we do with managers when we have self-directed teams?<p>If you look at the Feudal era (this is a gross oversimplification and varies wildly from from country to country), we had a king who gave land/authority to dukes, who gave land/authority to barons, who gave land/authority to knights, who had serfs work their fiefs. In return, the serfs had a place to live and gave food and goods to the knights, who pledged service to their liege, who pledged service to theirs, up to the king. The king also taxed every level of this and made orders of magnitude more money than the serfs.<p>There were a couple of interesting side-effects of this. First, while you were technically loyal to your king, he didn&#x27;t have much day-to-day impact and your loyalty was to those immediately surrounding you. Communication throughout the realm was slow or non-existent, further isolating communities. Politics were local, not national, and these made made medieval intrigues all the more fascinating. Second, there were <i>no price signals</i> inside of a feudal society. As a result, you couldn&#x27;t have a functioning economy in the modern sense.<p>And then about 300 years ago we had more and more international trade and many lords discovered that by displacing their peasants/serfs they could do things such as raise sheep and sell the wool for a far greater profit than having people harvesting food[1]. So you wound up with a bunch of free men traveling the land, selling their services where they could. In other words, you had one of the foundations to a modern economy: a mobile labor force.<p>Today, that feudal model still exists: inside of many large corporations. It&#x27;s a mess of internal politics. People have loyalty to their teams and maybe their boss, but not so much to Steve Ballmer. There are few, if any, internal price signals. <i>Internally</i>. If you commit &quot;treason&quot; by suggesting Ballmer should be fired, you might get laid off, but not executed. You have hiring and firing instead of births and deaths to maintain the work force. In may respects, the modern corporation resembles the old feudal system, but sped up many times. And the king/CEO still earns orders of magnitude more money than the workers/serfs, completely out of proportion to actual value provided.<p>Agile itself had its roots back in the 50s, but as a modern movement in programming, agile is still just over a decade old. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening to the traditional role of management, but the feudal system couldn&#x27;t compete with capitalism. I don&#x27;t think that traditional corporations can, either.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism#Enclosures_and_the_transition_from_feudalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism#Enclosure...</a><p><i>Edit</i>: A couple of tiny clarifications.",1381761883

Both of things things enormously contributed to his success. There are tons of people with drive who never even got close to his achievements, and tons more with ideal situations who never created anything of value. Gates had an ideal mix of character and good fortune.<p>There&#x27;s also the sad fact that personality derives a lot from upbringing and genetics, so you could say that the &quot;instinct and drive&quot; Gates had was also a facet of luck. In a way, most of what we are is roughly predetermined. Our character is a throw of the dice. We don&#x27;t even know if free will exists at all. This is why I tend to laugh at libertarians who believe they owe nothing to anyone.<p>Face it, luck is perhaps 90% of any tremendous success. Just because Gladwell wrote about this doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s not a reason to diss Gates and his ilk and stay envious and bitter; it just means we should stop basing our self worth on whether we&#x27;ve changed the world or not, and stop adulating important figures or trying to derive lessons from their every move.

6547468,comment,6545132,6547169,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"> I mostly agree with your points, but this one fails. I say there&#x27;s a pyramid. You say thats a politically incorrect concept to think about from a psuedo-right perspective, therefore it surely doesn&#x27;t exist and all topic change-y. Bzzt try again. Is there or is there not a pyramid of skills, and if a working definition of the level of civilization is looking at how the downtrodden are treated, what are you proposing?<p>Let me put it this way. For the simplicity sake let&#x27;s present workforce as the pyramid. So you have 1% who enjoy 50%+ or more of the wealth. You have 80% who are doing just fine. And you have 20% who are rock bottom poor and screwed over big time. The problem I have with socialism is that it obsesses about the poorest 20% so much, that is screws it over for the rest, the 80%. And at the end of the day everyone is poor because none of these socialist policies really work well. They just make everyone poorer. Margaret Thatcher is a great example of that on works. When she was the Prime Minister the income of the poorest 20% has been growing the fastest since the end of the WW2. The problem is that the other 80% was getting richer even faster. So poor felt like they are not getting their fair share. Without understanding that if you start introducing policies wealth transfer from 80% to the poor 20%, the poor won&#x27;t get richer! They&#x27;ll be still poor. You are so obsessed with this one pump attendant who made it big that by introducing the laws to take some wealth from the rich attendant, you don&#x27;t see that the same law makes the other 4 attendants poorer too. The problem with socialists is that they want to feel so much, they forget to think.<p>>There is another issue that as a civilization we&#x27;ve decided civilization means citizens will have police, fire, libraries, schools, national defense, unemployment, welfare of some forms, foreign aid, all that stuff (More civilized nations or more civilized people believe health care belongs on this list, and I agree).<p>Equaling civilization with socialism doesn&#x27;t work in my book. What about equaling the amount of freedom and responsibility with being civilized. So, if you - like one of my coworkers - eat, eat, eat and eat all day. She is fat, I tell you. And then - no excercise. Zero. Nada. Nothing. And then cigarettes. And then you go there and tell me it is civilized that I&#x27;m taxed higher to pay for her doctor, so I don&#x27;t have money for my kid&#x27;s school supplies? Nice. Very civilized. And where is her responsibility here? And where is my freedom to spend money on what I want, not what you want, my coworker wants, or the Government wants? What happened with this in our civilization?<p>>Anyway it takes $X to provide those services privately or via taxes, or the govt at an overhead cost of Y*$X will provide those services by taking extra money from everyone else and redistributing from each according their ability and to each according to their need.<p>And we know it doesn&#x27;t work. 20 years after communism failed there are still people who believe that you can run economy on a premise of Marxist &quot;redistributing from each according their ability and to each according to their need. &quot; Again, go back to your history books. Don&#x27;t listen to me. Even hard core communists like Slavoj Zizek will tell you that economically that didn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t work.<p>>The &quot;welfare queen&quot; in this situation is the service station, getting labor hours at a below civilization market cost.<p>And what is &quot;civilization market cost&quot; ? 1usd/hr? 2usd/hr? 50usd/hr? 1000usd/hr ? Can you define this nonsense?<p>> Essentially the welfare queen service station is stealing money from me as a taxpayer rather than paying their employees a legitimate fair wage.<p>If there wasn&#x27;t welfare state, nobody would be taking money from you.<p>>This is the well known &quot;walmart effect&quot; where poverty increases when walmart moves in, because the employees are below poverty line so the net effect is negative on .gov and the residents of that .gov who know have to pay higher taxes so Sam Walton&#x27;s heirs can become richer, all while being told this is fairness, capitalism style.<p>Why these people work at WalMart? Because they couldn&#x27;t find a better job! So WalMart is doing the a favor because without WalMart they would have ended up at even more shitty job. And shitty jobs are good. I had one - was sorting out garbage. Once you do that type of job, you&#x27;ll learn how to move up, without any stupid Government program. And if you stay at that level. It&#x27;s 20% of the poorest. Why would you rather screw it for the 80%, to have it better for 20%. And then the 20% would be still poor too. That&#x27;s what communism taught us. Everybody became poor. They made everyone equal. In their poverty.<p>>Why should I as a 3rd party be impoverished to make a rich welfare queen business owner richer, because a welfare queen business owner doesn&#x27;t feel like paying his employees what has been determined to be a fair minimum wage?<p>Nobody told you to vote for leftist welfare programs. If you voted for them, yeah, you need to pay for them. I know sucks, to have people voting for that nonsense that cost me money too bro, so we&#x27;re in it together.<p>>I legitimately and legally and ethically earn enough income to pay enough taxes to pay my share of national defense; why should I have to chip in more than my share because some welfare queen business owner isn&#x27;t competent enough to match my level of business skill and pay his fair share of taxes via paying his workers a fair wage?<p>What is fair wage? 5usd/hr? 10usd/hr? 50usd/hr? Is it fair when a guy cleaning WalMar makes as much as software developer? You think?<p>>Your more fundamental failure is not recognizing that when .gov and .com merge, as they&#x27;ve done globally, a marketing game of divide and conquer makes losers out of people fighting on either side. The goal is the destruction of the middle classes globally. They&#x27;re winning. Some countries are trying a PR campaign where .com and .gov merge and pretend .gov is in the drivers seat of the prison wagon, and some countries have a PR campaign where .com ang .gov merge and pretend .com is in the drivers seat of the prison wagon. However, if you&#x27;re the guy in the prison wagon at the start of a real world &quot;skyrim&quot; game do you really care about which PR campaign is superior and who&#x27;s pretending to drive that prison wagon?<p>This what you describe, this merge, is a very fascinating topic indeed. But its proper name is fascism (or corporationism as Duce called it), not capitalism. So, I&#x27;m afraid you might be barking at a wrong tree here. Let me give you example here: it were few Republicans, Tea Party sympathizers who voted against big banks bail-outs. All Democrats and rest of the Republicans voted for the fascist state where banks and the Government are in bed together. But not people who are by the left called the &#x27;extreme right&#x27;. Tea Party and others, who believe in capitalism, have been and will always be against bank bailouts, or special treatment to big corps. They believe in free market economy and honest competition. If banks have to go bankrupt, let them. That&#x27;s what capitalist would do. And we all know how left voted on this.",1381761369

Your inital quote confirms the commercial hardball that I never doubted and your later links confirm patent licensing demands against Android manufacturers although which isn&#x27;t really about an &quot;earlier incarnation [of MS]&quot; and they have been making patent licensing deals with a great number of Android manufacturers so I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d count it as hardball.<p>Note that I am not a supporter of Microsoft and avoid their products largely because of the commercial hardball they played when they had monopoly power but the original article suggested that they played &quot;legal hardball&quot; with OEMs who wanted to ship devices (I interpreted as PC&#x27;s) with additional operating systems rather than just MS ones.  I had no recollection of this and was looking for a reference before I add it to the list of offences I believe MS to have committed.  It is not implausible but it was a new claim and I wanted to understand it.<p>I&#x27;m interested in understanding why you think the B&N case is so sad and telling.  I haven&#x27;t investigated the patents claimed but in principle the idea that MS requests fees for using it&#x27;s patents isn&#x27;t actually a problem for me.",1381760800

It was hands down the best gaming experience of my life and this is coming from someone who really doesn&#x27;t appreciate single player games.<p>People don&#x27;t believe it but you DO have to gain your &#x27;vr legs&#x27; before diving into fast paced games like FPS.<p>You have to gradually work your way through games that are just at your limit until you find yourself able to handle something fast paced like FPS. For me it went roughly Blue Marble,Alone in the Dark,VR Helicopter,War Thunder (for 2 weeks), DoD:Source, HL2.<p>I think what may have been key to my transition was when I played DoD:Source, I just treated the Rift like a big screen in front of my face and used my mouse to look around the world rather than my head (DoD currently does not have separate head look/mouse look so where your head moves your cursor moves and vise versa). When I finally got around to playing HL2 (which has separate mouse look/head look so you can look up a flight of stairs, and than bring your cursor up to shoot) it was a small enough jump from DoD that I was able to play a half hour my first night, an hour my second and 3rd nights, and 3 straight hours on my last when I beat the game.<p>I think the greater issue Oculus Rift faces is that, even if you are careful to slowly acclimate yourself as I did, over time you will build a slight aversion to the Oculus Rift as your brain associates the odd glitch of nausea that are inevitable in any game with the Rift. So while I did say that HL2 was the best gaming experience of my life, I do admit that I haven&#x27;t been back to it since. I don&#x27;t know if thats a function of me beating the game or nausea, but I&#x27;d probably put it at 80/20 respectively.<p>I think that it will just be a matter of how compelling a game is to overcome the nausea/aversion. I suspect that if GTAV releases for the PC that I&#x27;ll find myself logging multiple hour session in the Rift again.",1381760659

So you would set up the Node.js app to run internally on ports 8080, 8081, 8082, and 8083 for example. (If you have a quad core server this assures that under extreme load each processor can be fully utilized by one single-thread Node.js process). Then Nginx serves requests on port 80 by fetching the response from one of those four internal ports in round robbin fashion.<p>If one of the processes crashes due to a bug or you want to specifically restart it so that a new code update takes effect in production then Nginx will automatically remove it from the pool while it is down and then add it back when it comes back online. When you are pushing out code updates you can cycle each process one at a time to do a zero downtime deploy.<p>The other cool thing that you can do with Nginx reverse proxies is use the proxy_cache as a robust cache layer to almost completely remove stress from your blog under high load.<p>Honestly for a basic personal blog this technique probably isn&#x27;t really necessary. You could just run it through Forever on port 80 with no Nginx and forget it, but if you expect tons of traffic, or if you want high 99% uptime, or if you just want to have some fun configuring a server then the technique I explained above is how you do it. It takes some fiddling to get Nginx configured properly and that tutorial I linked actually leaves out some details of the upstream server configuration but its pretty easy to figure out from the Nginx documentation.",1381759756

6547305,comment,6546768,6547046,2,0,VLM,,,"All of which is true and well written.  However it brings up the obvious point missed in the otherwise well written article that yes, if I use 32 bit hashes to shard into 2 to the power of 32 databases, some will have more collisions than others, aka the 32 MSB of a 32 bit hash has some &quot;bad looking&quot; variations.  But I don&#x27;t care about non-randomness in the LSBs because I&#x27;m infinitely more likely to shard into, perhaps, 2 to the power of 4 database machines.<p>The original article did not descend into that obvious area of research.  I see no particular reason why a hash algo that has the worst randomness shoved into the least significant byte (which I simply don&#x27;t care about) might be an inherent result of smooshing the best randomness into its most significant nibble, which I do care very much about.  Given the likely use case for a sharding hash, a smart hash designer would make sure that most of his effort is put into smooth distribution in MSB and perhaps totally ignore the LSB for a given amount of latency / computation / electrical power.  After all, the actual users are more likely to hash based on the first 4 bits than the first 24 bits.  Although you&#x27;ll always run into people who think its funny to pull their shard subset out of the hash using the LSB (why?) or some random byte in the middle (why?)<p>I think MSB for shard key comes out of the tradition in the really olden days of sharding based on raw unhashed data.  Sometimes thats random enough such that the MSB of the data makes an excellent shard key and hashing would just slow things down for a minimal gain, even today.",1381759624

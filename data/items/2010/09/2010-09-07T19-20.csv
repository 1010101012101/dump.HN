1669912,comment,1669009,1669512,0,0,lutorm,,,"I don't think it's incorrect. But for constant velocities it is canceled out because the relative motion causes things to also <i>appear</i> in a different direction. This happens with ordinary light, also. Stars appear in a different place to us because of our relative motion (they appear to be located more ""forward"" in our direction of motion).<p>As as example, assume there is a star directly perpendicular to our motion (and that the Earth moves in a straight line). Due to the vector addition of our motion and the light travel direction, it appears to us that the star is located slightly forward of perpendicular (typically by about 1/100 of a degree)  Now assume the star were to disappear. During the light travel time the star would have time to move backwards as seen by us (due to our forward motion) so that at the moment it disappears, it appears to be located perpendicular to us.<p>In the context of gravity, this effect (it's called aberration) exactly cancels and the net effect is that the gravitational attraction is in a direction different from the actual location of the attractor such that it <i>appears</i> that gravity is instantaneous.<p>This only works for constant velocities, once you have accelerations it becomes more complicated. And it's not a relativistic effect at all, it's present for all waves with finite propagation speeds. You can do this experiment with boats making waves and get the same result.<p>Edit: And your charge example is not so good. For Galilean invariant theories it's only <i>relative</i> motions that matter. There is no effect if the two are moving with the same velocity. (Plus, once there are relative motions between the charges, there will be induced magnetic fields which affect the dynamics.)",1283889388

Even light!  But, as you can see from E=m * c^2, it takes an insane amount of energy to make even a little mass-equivalent.  C=3 * 10^8 m/s, so c^2 = 9 * 10^16 or 90000000000000000 m^2/s^2.

Rivers are generally not a problem because federal road funding and near-universal car ownership make it easy to distribute growth on both sides of a river.  It is a problem when that river is a state boundary as well (which is often).",1283886645

On the front page, the only project that even pretends to be significant is ""Connecting Kids To Coverage Challenge"". Apparently there are 5 million children who have de facto health insurance, but are counted by the census as ""uninsured"". Your challenge is to change their census characterization by encouraging their parents to fill out some paperwork.<p>It's obvious that our enlightened bureaucrats are unwilling to risk losing their jobs if a crowdsourced solution actually works better than they do (witness the backlash against, for instance, charter schools and vouchers). Why should we care that, as a purely propaganda move, the government is crowdsourcing the problem of teaching children how to become president?",1283886641

Granted, automating the semantics here could be tough and very expensive with the amounts of data available to Google's.  However, there are some ways to do that if the index can be structured more efficiently and by using low-level semantic logic like taxonomies - I wrote a white paper about this if anyone is interested:  <a href=""http://www.exorbyte.com/index.php/White-Papers/ajax-incremental-search-interfaces.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exorbyte.com/index.php/White-Papers/ajax-incremen...</a>",1283886282

I used a toy double blade helicopter, like these ones:<p><a href=""http://www.rc-airplane-world.com/coaxial-rc-helicopters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rc-airplane-world.com/coaxial-rc-helicopters.html</a><p>And it sure seemed to have a lot of rotational inertia. If you were right, then I could touch one side of the helicopter slightly and since it has no rotational inertia it would tilt to the side and completely change direction and fly off somewhere into the wall or the floor. This did not happen however, even when I tried to tilt it the helicopter remained horizontal. And please do not tell me that a $50 toy has an active stability system with internal gyros and all the required electronics and super fast servos.<p>And now that I think of it, I remember that the russians have been making counter rotational helicopters for ages. See for example this one:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamov_Ka-25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamov_Ka-25</a><p>How does this helicopter stay horizontally stable in the air and does not fly off on a tangent when tilted by the slightest cross wind? Note that this one was designed in the late 50's before any electronic active stability systems could have been invented.",1283886176

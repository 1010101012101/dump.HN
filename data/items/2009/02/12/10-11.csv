The problems I see are the following:<p>(1) The question -- when properly understood -- is empirical by nature. One would need to select a random sample in both fields, measure the innovation within the samples for a given period of time, and publish the results. While this is not rocket science, the problem is in the details: What is innovation? How would one operationalize the term?<p>(2) In most cases when I've read such opinion articles, the discussion does not seem to be about innovation  -- in the sense of ""new way of doing something"" (wikipedia). There are a million new ways to do something, but only a small fraction thereof is useful. That often seems to be the unsaid meaning to those who say Open Source is not innovating. Sure, nothing stops Open Source suppliers to innovate. However, they often don't care, simply because they don't profit by doing so. There's just one exception to the rule: Software by developers for developers. This is where Open Source shines because developers understand the needs of fellow developers (or technical people, in general). In general, however, Open Source developers don't care enought about common consumers to develop a new and useful product that helps them solve their problems. Thus, they just copy existing stuff.<p>(3) Slightly related to (2), another problem is attention and presentation: Innovation usually doesn't sell despite the glory of the term. See the ""Myths of innovations"" by Scott Berkun. The first chapter points to many examples and is free to download. To sell an innovative idea, one first needs the attention of the audience. Second, one needs to present the innvovation so that it's understood. Open Source developers often lack these skills, according to their own statements. A proprietary vendor can simple hire people with these skills but Open Source developers often cannot due to lack of income. Consequently, open source is often percieved to be less innovative, even when it is.<p>This is why I think, pointing to examples is pointless.",1234436223

478294,comment,478182,478182,0,0,billroberts,,,"I have a speculative (read: probably garbage) theory, orthogonal to the one in this article, that you can get some idea of a person's personality from their looks.  My hypothesis is that as long as you are not too young, then the most common expressions that your face assumes - frowning, smiling, scowling etc - have some effect on your wrinkles and facial muscle development. So maybe by looking at someone, you can see some aspect of the history of their facial expressions and hence guess if they are generally a cheerful, miserable or sneering kind of person.<p>A corollary (also probably garbage!) is that one of the clues that helps you guess a person's nationality by looking at them is these similar aspects of 'face-shaping': either through the most common sounds they make while speaking their language, or the typical mannerisms of that culture. Obviously this would only work within a group of people that have broadly similar racial characteristics.  My 'sample group' is mainly from western European countries.",1234435703

It's a software based tool that they boot up on the sidelines when needed that uses a few different cognitive tests to determine the next steps to take as far as treatment is concerned, and each player does a initial ""baseline"" test before the season so on-field results are relative to the player.<p>If anyone is interested in reading more, the company also has some good resources for treatment and diagnosis on their site. \n<a href=""http://www.impacttest.com/concussionresource.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.impacttest.com/concussionresource.php</a><p>""Back in the day"" they used to just give us the ol' ""what day is it?"" question, which, as everyone knows is easy - if I'm wearing rugby gear, it must be a Saturday!

Gould, in general I think you should be skeptical about what people are telling you and the onus is on you, the consumer of the information to verify its truth. Gould was wrong about some things, and right about others. This is a crime of which many scientists are guilty, Gould is no exception.<p>I have no dog in this fight because I'm not active in that particular field but I personally hope they'll remember the man for the work that he did and that he will be forgiven for his mistaken views.<p>Science politics changes on death at the time...",1234433736

One previously quite common variation was putting sensitive information in a Microsoft Word document, deleting the most sensitive information, then sending it out while neglecting to purge the change history.<p>Another favorite is putting black bars over data to obscure it, without realizing that the data in the below layers is merely obscured, not obliterated.  (Seems like that happened here.)<p>My personal favorite is putting sensitive information (such as bank account numbers on a check) under a mosaic.  Why is this my favorite?  Because breaking it typically requires training a neural network (my Google-fu lacks at the moment but you'll find the article fast if you look).

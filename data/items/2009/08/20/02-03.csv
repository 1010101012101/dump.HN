The right to run a red light, the right to molest little children, etc. That's what laws are. They define the gray area. They define the boundary as to what's acceptable and what's not.

774281,comment,774219,774249,0,0,Goladus,,,"There are benefits to rising late as well.  Some of them are similar to the ones listed in the article.  If you are in your room by yourself, 1AM to 2AM tends to be a quiet and peaceful time.  A lot of social activity also happens around midnight, and if you are an early riser you may find yourself burnt out and unable to participate by the time midnight rolls around.  If you are forced to stay up late a few days in a row and you naturally wake up early as well, you may start accumulating a sleep deficit.  A sleep deficit will eventually catch up to you and you'll stop appreciating those morning benefits.<p>There was also an article posted a while back of a study done that showed people who tend to wake up late performed better on some cognitive tests at certain times of the day, while there was no similar advantage for people who naturally woke up early at any other times.<p>I do think <i>this</i> article does point out some of the practical advantages that the experiment in that other article wasn't interested in; like how a sunrise makes you feel, the value of beating commute traffic, the value of getting a head start on daily activities, etc.  (I like rising early and have tended to for the past 5-6 years.

It's good for society if one guy sends a boat to retrieve that treasure. It's less good for society if 5 people get into a race for the treasure. Maybe we get the treasure in 5 days rather than 7, but we also sent 5 boat trips out rather than 1.<p>Similarly, picking up alpha in 12 seconds rather than 15 is probably not useful to the rest of the world, although picking up alpha is better than leaving it on the table.<p>I do agree with you that most of the carping about HFT is stupid, however.",1250734663

I believe the Hosts or /etc/hosts file or a cached DNS server are 1. enough to meet such users' needs (i.e. to list all unique sites a user will visit in a lifetime), 2. small enough to be manageable with today's technology (e.g. the entire .com namespace could be addressed in a file under 150mb) and 3. simple enough for users to understand (e.g. analogous to an address book; cf. the concept of a distributed database).  Moreover, I believe users are quite capable of remembering 10-digit numbers, as they routinely do with telephone numbers, usually by maintaining a personal address book.  But I think users are never given the chance to evaluate these options, because 1. they are unaware of them, and 2. the usual sorts of ""FUD campaigns"", for lack of a better term.",1250734448

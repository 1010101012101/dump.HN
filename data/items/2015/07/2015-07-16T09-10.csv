9896244,comment,9895558,9895558,0,0,vonklaus,,,"Due to drug prohibition millions of people are running self-supervised experiments on themselves with a limited ability to verify the chemical compounds they are ingesting. You can buy Mecke and Marquis reagents[0] to test for things but RCs(research chemicals) like the 2C class indicated in the article are difficult to test for. MDMA has been around a long time but often is mixed with amphetamines, ephedrine, MDA or other chemicals that are cheaper or easier to obtain. So now we do not have the information nor the data to make a case about these drugs either way.<p>Due to friction in black and grey markets it is not only difficult to verify substances, but the reputation of suppliers as they obviously aren&#x27;t doing CR on yelp. This is exactly what happened with &quot;Bath Salts&quot;. At first, they were legal and reputable dealers sold them to club kids used to using meth and other amphetamines. The drugs were newer and untested, but &quot;somewhat&quot; safe after being out in the world. As negative press and deaths were reported the substance was banned. Less reputable dealers continued to create drugs with slightly different chemical makeups and batch tested accross the population. These drugs were more dangerous and in some cases only tried by a handful of people before release.<p>Shulgin notes this in the article saying that amateur chemists thirsty for profits are either releasing untested chemicals into the market, or making mistakes in synthesizing known psychoactive substances.<p>We can&#x27;t get data on these drugs so we don&#x27;t know much about them. The 2c class has some promising RCs it would be nice if there was a way to record the data from the thousands of people doing these trials on themselves. Shulgin has a license, probably one of only a few ever given by the DEA, to produce, synthesize and test RCs and Psychoactive substances. It would make sense that the gov&#x27;t could issue such a license to people for the trial of these chemicals for scientific purposes. Until then, only a few people will ever have real data about these drugs and it will be unable to be verified or shared due to the stigma and legal repercussions for coming forward.<p>sad.<p>[0]<a href=""https://dancesafe.org/shop/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dancesafe.org/shop/</a>",1437040522

9896208,comment,9892970,9895625,0,0,dnautics,,,"> That mechanism is good for society, because it means that nobody is just hoarding a gold pile somewhere.<p>Why is that necessarily bad?  Inflation requires individuals and companies to grow to maintain value, that is potentially unsustainable.  If the money base grows faster than resources utilization can be made more efficient, then you wind up either 1) destroying the environment or 2) screwing over the poor.  In order to continue, the exponential growth inherent in inflation presumes a future that is rosier than the present.  The people who get screwed over are not the wealthy, they have access to inflation-proofed investments and also have access to the lowest interest rates (most competitive with inflation, sometimes better than) to make leveraged reallocation of resources.<p>That kind of base cannot handle <i>anything</i> catastrophic.  Because everyone is yoked together by leveraging, a catastrophic event, say, a tsunami in seattle, will domino over such that the individuals depending on the fractional reserve of the victim&#x27;s holdings will then be forced into default, and those dependent on them, and so on and so forth via the multiplier effect.<p>To say that a non-inflationary system cannot handle an catastrophe is simply ignoring some pretty stark evidence.  Between 1820-1900 the US was effectively on the gold standard and somehow, it managed to survive a massive civil war that tore apart the nation and not 40 years later it was basically one of the world powers.",1437039779

I don&#x27;t mind it much by itself, but it brings serious interference between us. Beside the bearable fact that it&#x27;s slightly annoying to see someone having short but unexplainable behavior in your presence, sometimes I have to repeat myself because she can&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m telling her while she&#x27;s in the middle of a compulsion, or sometimes she&#x27;s blocking my way, and won&#x27;t acknowledge my presence to let me get through. It&#x27;s often hard to accept that my immediate existence as a human being has a lower priority in her brain than her irrational compulsions. It sometimes drifts into a feeling of betrayal, since she never talked about it before we were committed to each other. I don&#x27;t blame her, she was very ashamed and genuinely though she could temper her compulsions for me.<p>The other problem is that I can&#x27;t talk too much about it, since she can&#x27;t help it, she always at risk to build up more guilt, and with no possible release, ends up with more stress. And for someone with OCD, more risks of irrational fears and then compulsions. Vicious circle.<p>I had a lot of thoughts on the subject, and to me OCD really looks like a dissonance on processing reality, and control of it. To me anxiety is mostly a feeling to push the brain into anticipation of the future, a stimulation of intelligence to solve problems like having a safe shelter or ensuring food provisions for the days to come, to control the environment. This requires to understand your environment, and trust this understanding to feel safe and stop anxiety. My theory is that people with OCD have difficulties to feel that safety, and combined with some anxiety they have the urge to interact with their environment to satisfy the brain with its need of control of the environment. But since there is nothing to do for immediate safety and control, something totally irrational is built from the ground up, for the sole purpose of doing something, and satisfy the brain.",1437039346

9896112,comment,9894423,9894560,0,0,SiVal,,,"The LDS Church takes a very dim view of publishing genealogical information about living people. It is forbidden by church policy on any church-related site, many potential customers of a genealogy site are Mormon, and most of them know this policy, support it, and would take a VERY dim view of a website that intentionally violated it. I once consulted on an online genealogy system for the LDS Church, and being able to prevent this sort of privacy invasion was explicitly part of the spec as part of longtime, standing policy. As I very vaguely recall, the spec required a death date in the data for anything other than `(Living Person)` to be displayed (even the name was blocked), and in the absence of a death date, the data would not be displayed unless the birth date was more than a century earlier (which I think was later extended to more than a century, but I&#x27;m not sure.)<p>Unfortunately, the site you mention has no connection to the church, but if the CEO was interviewed on a site called &quot;mormonentrepreneur.net&quot;, he might in fact be very receptive to an email that simply claimed that someone had posted personal genealogical information about living people, you and your family, on his site, that you are &quot;sure his policies (like other legitimate genealogy websites) would not allow this&quot;, and you would like it removed.<p>You should at least start that way for the reasons I mentioned and for the fact that, like Reddit, these businesses mostly host huge piles of data contributed by non-staff members, and it is often too much data for their few staff members to have any hope of proactively moderating. You might need to be a squeaky wheel just because of the logistics.<p>I hope that just pointing out that these are indisputably living people will be enough, but it&#x27;s possible they will require some proof of your identity, because these sites are the targets of lots of data disputes between family members who try to modify each other&#x27;s data as well as plain ol&#x27; vandalism.",1437037817

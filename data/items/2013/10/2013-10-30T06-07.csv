In areas where libraries like MathJax are not good enough, we&#x27;d love to hear feedback about what APIs we would need to expose so that MathJax, et al, can create an awesome MathML implementation.&quot;<p>This, coupled with the fact that WebKit MathML wasn&#x27;t up to snuff, is a pretty good rationale IMO.<p>Standards-compliance is a means to an end (interoperability), doesn&#x27;t mean browsers should implement every niche spec that someone comes up with.

The cost of maintaining &quot;that power&quot; is not hypocrisy, even though the article implies that it is. The cost is better represented by $700 billion per year in military spending (plus the $50 billion in foreign aid), and the only reason why this is sufficient is that the system is indeed &quot;legitimated by liberal ideas&quot; (if it was say Islamic law that had to be maintained, the costs would be much higher).

The basic principle is that of everyone who pays in, the lucky ones subsidize the unlucky ones.<p>Obviously, this works best the more people who pay in. When people don&#x27;t get insurance until they need it, it raises the cost for everyone. When people don&#x27;t get insurance and <i>still</i> end up burdening those who did (by going bankrupt when faced with monstrous E.R. bills, for a common example), costs go up for everyone. In these situations, there&#x27;s only way to make the system work: <i>enforce</i> that <i>everyone</i> buys in. That&#x27;s why I support single-payer.<p>Here&#x27;s another car analogy: car insurance is mandatory for drivers in the U.S., and most countries. Because the system only works when everyone buys in.<p>Of course it offends the libertarian sensibility to <i>force</i> people to buy something. How barbaric! Personally, I&#x27;m a libertarian-to-leftist convert. I think society needs a monopoly on force, and that monopoly goes to the government. The use of that force should be minimized, but one of reasons we need it is to <i>force</i> people to chip in for the common good. When it comes to pooled risk for catastrophic events, it&#x27;s worth it. I have no moral qualms. It&#x27;s not a matter of who&#x27;s doing the planning, it&#x27;s a matter of societal choices that just plain don&#x27;t work if not everyone&#x27;s on board. You&#x27;re right that central planning is not voluntary. <i>That&#x27;s the whole point</i>.<p><i>>  But outside of &quot;character&quot; or other intangibles, there&#x27;s no incentive to avoid the safety netsin fact there&#x27;s every incentive to use them, lest you be a sucker.

Paying taxes makes sense for businesses, and various other organisations on an economic level. Paying taxes in Australia (where I am), for example, gets you a wide variety of benefits that most people appreciate, and most of them don&#x27;t feel forced to do so. Maybe at some baseline level they are &#x27;forced&#x27; to do so, but it is done voluntarily. Just as you would say that a person taking a job because otherwise they will starve is a voluntary act, so can paying taxes be voluntary despite the background threat of prison.<p>Same with religion, maybe those initial people will not be Christians, but maybe their grandchildren will be if the occupation continues. The Ottomans, for example, converted people to Islam through tax incentives and education.<p>A test case for you:<p>In Canada (and Australia), for example, 89% of the land is in direct ownership by the Crown, the other 11% is rented by the Crown to individuals in the form of land tenure. Legally, the Queen is not allowed to permanently sell any land, as they are subject to the old rules of English family law, where descendants are to be entitled to inherit the land. The Queen, through the Government of Canada which represents her, is the owner of the entire country. Does she not have the right to charge whatever rent rates (taxes) she would like?

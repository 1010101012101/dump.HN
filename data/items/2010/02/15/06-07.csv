I realize you can't lay out your entire case by page 4, but I would have felt more comfortable with an indication of the basis for this term and that it will be proven to be systematic hyping.<p>Page 5: ""Recent revelations from the Climategate emails, originating from the Climatic Research Unit\nat the University of East Anglia showed how all the data centers, most notably NOAA and\nNASA, conspired in the manipulation of global temperature records to suggest that\ntemperatures in the 20th century rose faster than, in reality, they actually did.""<p>""Conspired"" is possibly accurate, but a little jarring, especially when applied to ""my"" NASA; they gave us Tang, after all. A more specific reference or reminder, rather than a footnote to an entire report, would have been good here to soften the blow to someone who watched the Apollo 11 landing in my pajamas on my knees 18 inches from the TV.<p>Page 5: ""Around 1990, NOAA began weeding out more than three-quarters of the climate measuring\nstations around the world. They may have been working under the auspices of the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO).

1126050,comment,1123995,1125934,1,0,glhaynes,,,"What happens when the user wants to install software that's not in one of the install's default repositories? The web page walks them through adding another repository URL to their package manager GUI [which is YA of a dozen]?<p>I'm attracted to the idea of just building a sufficiently sophisticated app management utility and then everything will work perfectly, but in practice it just doesn't seem to happen.<p>What a package manager does is build a necessarily-leaky abstraction over the set of operations needed to manage an application instance lifecycle. What if a non-experienced user wants to move an app from one system to another, though? No ""mere mortal"" is going to be able to accomplish that task on an average Linux box.<p>Mac OS X instead relies on a convention of bundling all necessary files together into an app bundle that's self-contained (and represented as such) and thus can be treated by the user as a cohesive, unitary Thing. Thus installation, deinstallation, sharing, and migration of the app are all done through an identical metaphor which also applies to the other filesystem entities that users care about: documents. So, sure, Mac OS X doesn't have ""package management"" (as part of the vendor install) but its users have a more pleasant and unified experience. This provides a tremendously better sense of empowerement and relaxation to most users than a wholly separate GUI full of messages about ""dependency resolution"" and the like. Again, I understand where you're coming from, and in certain aspects and particular vertical instances I have no doubt the Linux automatic installer over package manager model could provide a better experience, but the average computer user is far better off with a less sophisticated system.<p>(Yes, many Mac OS X apps use a separate install routine. I think this is unfortunate, but I don't get the sense that it's high on Apple's agenda because they're so pleased with the App Store model, which is another essay for another time.)",1266216952

Is there really a need to cloud things with name calling.<p>And really, are people actually skeptical that the climate is changing, or are they skeptical that's it's changing so severely and destructively that we need to put a trillion dollars on hot.<p>Hasn't the climate always changed?  Wasn't their a 1,000 foot deep, 20,000 sq m lake in Utah, and a land bridge between North America and Western Europe?  Is this the one right temperature?  By what measure?",1266213976

1125986,comment,1125315,1125328,0,0,jacobolus,,,"This is neat. Some possible drawbacks:<p>(1) Browser layout engines are pretty messed up, and adding a bunch of shy hyphens can lead to really weird layout issues. I wish I had some good examples, but basically it has to do with taking into account the amount of space a hyphen takes up, and using that to compute how long lines should be, but then when the hyphens are in the middle of the line, not showing them. Anyway, as I remember sometimes it can result in text being eaten (i.e. not shown properly).<p>In other words, I’d try to do specific testing in a bunch of browsers, resizing a window through all reasonable sizes it might be, before counting on shy hyphens to work properly.<p>(2) This is still going to break search within pages. Pretty stupid that browsers can’t do proper search, but so it goes.<p>(3) This is going to be effectively a line-by-line paragraph composer, because browsers don’t do any kind of real paragraph layout. And it still won’t do any adjustment of inter-letter space. The combination of these two things means that using justified text is going to still usually end up looking like crap. Better than without any hyphenation, but not all that much better.<p>----<p>In short, this is kind of a half-way stopover workaround for the absolutely stupid lack of real hyphenation and justification algorithms in current browsers. Absolutely stupid because this is a <i></i>solved problem<i></i>: the algorithm used by TeX and described in one of Knuth’s students in the late 70s works pretty darn well (Adobe uses a modified version for InDesign), and on modern hardware should be perfectly reasonably fast, as well.<p>It’s not quite as bad as the lack of real layout in Microsoft Word, given that laying out text is the <i>only purpose</i> of that application, but still.... pretty bad.",1266213865

Can you provide links to other sources?<p>You should also moderate your tone.  A lot.  I've been reading and talking to people about global warming since the early 90s, and I'm strongly predisposed to take scientists at their word.  If the stridency in your writing can make <i>me</i> want to close my laptop and take a nap, it's certain to stir up angry feelings in people who vehemently oppose to the idea of global warming.  They will respond in kind, HN will get a little less civil, hence a little less useful for everyone.  And you will bear part of the responsibility.",1266213656

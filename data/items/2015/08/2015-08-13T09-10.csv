I wasn&#x27;t clear enough, what I wanted to say is that on Linux we have terminal emulators which try their best to emulate (hence the name) physical hardware from ages ago. I was both impressed and seriously disturbed when I read this: <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/</a> In short:<p>> In present time, we find ourselves in a world where physical teletypes and video terminals are practically extinct. Unless you visit a museum or a hardware enthusiast, all the TTYs you&#x27;re likely to see will be emulated video terminals — software simulations of the real thing. But as we shall see, the legacy from the old cast-iron beasts is still lurking beneath the surface.<p>PowerShell simply ignores all the legacy cruft and doesn&#x27;t even try to be compatible with 1940-era hardware. Which is, in my opinion, better and a sound technical decision, which resulted in much better architecture. The problem is that most Linux cmd-line apps expect to work under terminal emulators, not inside a modern environment PS provides.",1439456918

Every SHA-3 finalist&#x27;s mode was shown to be &#x27;perfect&#x27; (indifferentiable) as long as the compression function remains strong. So if a length-extension attack is found on hash function H, this means that something has gotten horribly wrong and it is likely that more serious attacks are also possible.<p>It is in the compression function (resp. permutation) that Keccak differs the most from BLAKE. BLAKE is ARX-based---like SHA-2---while Keccak only uses bitwise operations. Since SHA-2 is not being deprecated by NIST, they figured that having a &#x27;different&#x27; SHA-3 would hedge their bets against an attack against ARX primitives that could potentially break both SHA-2 and {BLAKE, Skein}. This is stated in [1, §3.4]. This has nothing to do with the MD structure.<p>Sure, when discussing these things security does come first. But all of these functions have been thoroughly vetted already, so the differentiators are elsewhere: sponges are flexible, BLAKE is faster in software, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf</a>",1439456863

E.g. Show value and ideally ease of implementation. Make this short. Someone is likely to view your offer at a glance. Make a non committing and interesting call to action. 2) Have follow up materials for those that do where you go into detail and expand on selling points and information. Ideally you&#x27;ll run them through in person. This could be for broshures or the website.<p>LinkedIn should be your friend for making initial contact with decision makers. Try advertising and direct contact. Look to use that to get on the phone or have a face to face meeting. Be chill about your approach and don&#x27;t push or be overly eager. Don&#x27;t harass as people are busy and might be interested just not now but stay in contact with new and interesting information. Personally if I don&#x27;t get a reply I wait 3-6 months to recontact.  Aim to contact people up the food chain at companies. Things get taken more seriously when something interesting is passed down &#x27;to investigate&#x27; that a junior presenting up.<p>Given your product is new use this as a sales point.

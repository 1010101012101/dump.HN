1176592,comment,1176505,1176505,0,0,orblivion,,,"So, my understanding was that the questions of quantum cryptography stem from the fact that cryptographic algorithms designed to stump current computers will be a breeze for quantum computers, so new algorithms will need to be created to stump quantum computers. I thought that's what was referred to as ""quantum encryption"". Is there another name for what I'm thinking of?<p>But now they're saying that this ""quantum encryption"" they speak of will be ""perfectly"" secure? Does this mean that, once established, cryptography will no longer need to be a field of study?<p>Also this: ""This solves the problem by embedding it in an extra abstract dimension, which is independent of space. So as long as both Alice and Bob know the way in which all these abstract dimensions are related, the third provides a reference against which measurements of the other two can be made."" blows my mind. The fact that this ""other dimension"" stuff is no longer just speculation, but will soon be part of our lives.",1268085582

I'm possibly right in the ""average"" for a gamer, ~ 25 years old, lots of disposable income (corporate programming) etc. Most of my gamer orientated friends are sitting in the same category, and also own ~100 -> 200 games each. Perhaps steam just isn't orientated towards you? Did you jump on the forums (the quickest solution to a problem is to ask) or fire off a support request (can take ~ 10 days, but usually they will resolve it?). I personally love that I can see when a friend  jumps into a game of TF2 (Team Fortress 2), and follow them in with 2 clicks (right click on name ==> join server).",1268085546

This is in pretty much every economics textbook, including the one by Greg Mankiw (Bush's chief economics adviser) that I read in college.<p>What we saw however, was that according to Dick Cheney, ""Deficits don't matter [as long as a republican is in office]"", then as soon as a democrat is in office, deficit spending during the worst financial meltdown in recent history is against economic fundamentals all of a sudden.<p>On healthcare..  I don't even know where to start, whether it's with your total refusal to acknowledge that we should focus on dollar-driven solutions (""I don't believe the ends justify the means""), or your incoherent philosophy ""I don't believe in government financed healthcare in general EXCEPT for medicare, in which case I'll accuse you of 'gutting' it.""<p>At the end of the day, we have a huge budget hole as a result of skyrocketing medical costs.  I spent 3 years in local government laying off teachers and feeling like shit about it because of those costs.  Forgive me if I value those teachers' paychecks and the kids' education over abstract ideals about what is socialism, what isn't, and how something can only be a good idea if a republican proposes it.",1268085512

He's scared that he could break his computer, and lose his data. I'm scared that I'll fuck up something on my car, and need to have it fixed by a proper mechanic, costing me time and money.<p>I think most people are scared of breaking something, if they're sensible. I know a couple of people who aren't scared to 'try' anything and the result has been a semi-burned down apartment (I can do my own wiring!) and a new set of dining furniture (I can sand it down myself!).<p>I think that the fear that people tend to have is from ignorance though. I'm trying to learn about being my own atuo-mechanic; I'm teaching my father more about the computer. What people maybe don't realise is just how hard it is to break a computer permanently. This is one of the biggest factors in people being poor with computers; I think that another is that there is often no clear indication of partial success, which is pretty discouraging for an adult who is starting to learn.",1268085402

If you could disable all those ad blockers do you believe that same ad inventory would be of any value to an advertiser?

1176562,comment,1176369,1176369,0,0,Xurinos,,,"Or don't use DRM at all.<p>Instead of relying on a single instance of a product making money for years to come, focus more on new games or in-game content sales.  Better yet, focus more on positive features and bugfixes/polish for present games than on ways to defeat crackers.  Knowing your limitations, try social solutions for social problems.  Make your brand the trusted good source for awesome games of your niche.<p>More elaboration on that last tip: Warez and hacker sites have a deadly mix of people wanting to share things and people wanting to take advantage of sharers.  Sure, you can get some game for free, or you can apply some patch that allows you to OPK people in an FPS, but you have to blindly trust whoever submitted that game/patch to have your best interests at heart.  You have to ignore how, for example, some people playing the game of Combat Arms unknowingly spam their server chat with advertisements for the hack site.  You have to believe that no one would put a backdoor on your system through your game and have access to any account and credit card information you may have stored via that game or on your computer.<p>In other words, the system is about trust, and if your brand matches or exceeds its customers' expectations, you will earn and maintain their trust and their loyalty.  Sure, some people may be cheap, but at the same time, they can be bought with a certain amount of guarantee of security.  People are concerned about their things.<p>Educate people more about these completely real and ongoing dangers -- most people have no idea they are part of a botnet, thanks to a little sneaky thing they thought they could do -- and litigate less.  One makes you a hero, and the other paints you as a villain.  One makes you an expert, and the other turns away customers.",1268084973

Do one of these per week, in a little over a month you'll have a foundation. Remember SEO is like farming, you reap what sow and it takes a long time to reap the harvest of all the hard work.<p>1. Leverage your competition, by finding your top five closest competitors and spend your first round of SEO getting links from the top 100 sites that link to them. Once you filter out the ones that you won't be able to contact or you know can't edit their content to add another link, you'll be down to 20% of those 500 links. Now, you can do this in a day. Create an email, send it to each one of those guys asking for a backlink, telling them you're in the space and explaining why they should link to you. <i>Don't pay for links, because it's not worth the risk of the google ""police"" finding out.</i><p>2. Long Tail. Don't focus on ranking for the super-competitive keyword such as ""flowers"", rank for medium-tail keywords that you can make some ground on with less effort. ""flowers going away party"", ""flowers evil mother-in-law"", etc. Related to #1, when you ask for a link, feel free to suggest anchor text in the link that helps you get what you want from that link.<p>3. Kickstart your on-site content strategy. Make a list of 100 articles that would help you drive traffic. Take the top 10 ideas and hire someone to write them. For each article, when you publish it, find 100 more people to ask for links to the article. Send them specific text and a specific page you want them to link to.<p>4. Authorities. Make a list of 10 authorities on your subject <i>who blog or create content</i>. Write an article that you think would be interesting to them, something specific that is in their space. Make the content really good. Contact them personally (phone call, even) and ask for links to the article. In the flowers example, academics focused on environmental issues related to flower farming, for example.<p>5. Directories. Build resource articles that cover your space in a way that focuses on your strengths. Find directories and ask them to link to your article. In the flowers example, an article on determining the proper type of flower for all special occasions or religious events.<p>6. Build links.<p>7. Build links.<p>8-10. Build links.",1268084863

Each individual investor in a fund – there could be thousands in each – had to personally fill out the forms, and then wait months for a reply. Once they received an exemption, they had to file a return with Canadian tax authorities informing them of the exception.<p>“All of the complications made investors perceive Canada as not being conducive to capital,” said John Ruffolo, the leader of Deloitte's technology practice in Canada.<p>“U.S. venture capitalists just said ‘Forget it, I'll give my money to Israel or India where it's actually wanted.'“ Deloitte did a study in 2007 and found American investors considered Canada the worst place to invest in the developed world “by an overwhelming and massive margin” because of the rules. While the changes won't automatically lead to a flood of investment, any help is welcome in an industry that has seen sharp declines.<p>“There aren't 20 deals just sitting there waiting to be had,” Mr. Ruffolo said. “But what happens now is the large funds in Boston and Silicon Valley will once again take a look at Canada.”<p>The Canadian Venture Capital Association (CVCA) said 2009 was the sector's worst year in more than a decade, as investments slipped by 27 per cent to $1-billion.<p>The amount invested per firm was 40-per-cent lower than obtained by U.S. counterparts, the widest gap in Canada-U.S financings since 2005.<p>“The barriers we had in place left Canadian companies undercapitalized,” said CVCA president Gregory Smith, who has been lobbying for the change for seven years. “This hasn't just been an issue about an economic crisis. Other countries have been more aggressive in supporting the ecosystems where venture capitalists operate.”<p>Carol Leaman has seen the effects firsthand. As chief executive officer of PostRank, a Waterloo, Ont.-based social media analytics company, she had a slew of U.S. suitors “kicking the tires” when she sought financing in 2008. Their message was the same – we're interested, but it's too complicated to bother.<p>“I can't tell you the number of times we heard that they'd like to invest but the paperwork was just too much,” she said. “There were just too many hoops, it made it virtually impossible. So you rely on local VCs, and there aren't that many.”<p>While many say the changes were needed, Canadian venture capitalist Mark McQueen cautioned that it's just one piece of a larger solution to the industry's problems. Pension funds have stepped away from early-stage financing, and governments haven't stepped in to fund companies at their earliest stages of development.<p>He said a more meaningful move would be for the government to set aside $300-million and create 10 funds, to become self-funding as investments become commercialized.<p>“The industry needs to be restocked with capital,” said Mr. McQueen, CEO of Wellington Financial. “Show me one U.S.-funded deal [in Canada] that did not have Canadians in earlier. Without money early, you won't bring in the bigger investors.”",1268083028

1176419,comment,1176294,1176294,0,0,lmkg,,,"SEO has two basic components: making your site seem good and worthwhile, and associating it with particular search terms. Making it good and worthwhile and not-spammy mostly has to do with incoming links, and having fresh content. Reach out to blogs and other sites in your domain to try and collect back-links.<p>In order to find what terms you should associate with your site, do some basic research on search volume (google has some tools for this). Once you have the terms you want to rank for, it's a matter of making them more prominent in your site. Header tags, the title tag, the first 100 words of your body copy (p tags), and your URL structure (readable & hierarchical) have the strongest impact on this, as does the anchor text of both internal and external links. Meta description doesn't impact your ranking, but it does impact click-through in the search engine listings because it's the default text the search engine will display under the title.<p>The last part is making sure that content is available in text form on your page. Banners that are in flash or image files should either be replaced with images, or you can do graceful degradation by having the text be replaced with images via javascript (this is consider OK by google so long as the replacing image contains the same text). If you have videos, include transcripts or at least summaries. If you have lots of images, use the alt attribute. Don't make things Ajax unless you really need to.<p>The last recommendation is don't spam. You'll get penalized. Spamming is putting more SEO-bait than content on your page, and/or placing content that search engines will see but most users won't (putting the same content in different forms is ok). Most tricks you can think of, someone else has thought of first, and you will get burned for it. Done properly, white-hat SEO and accessibility overlap very well, since search engine spiders are basically low-capability browsers.",1268082192

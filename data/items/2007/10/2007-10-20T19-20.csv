70743,comment,70675,70732,0,0,bct,,,"> They say things like auctions, but I don't see what's wrong with SQL for those.<p>For local data sets, SQL's great. For remote, centralized data sets you can use something similar.<p>But once you want to combine data sets spread out over several sites (say, combining IMDB with local movie listings) you need to express that data in a format with globally unique identifiers and distributed extensibility. That's RDF. You can still have a nice query language, see SPARQL (which is much nicer than SQL, IMO).<p>> And if you used Google to search the web for millions of currently-listed auctions on webpages in XML format, you'd have a difficult time trying to find what you want.<p>Sure, if you're just doing full-text search like Google does. Of course, the point of having machine-readable data is that you're not limited to full-text search.",1192910123

Craig Venter, the first human being to have his genome sequenced, pointed out in interviews[1] that even after the sequencing, no one could tell for sure from the sequence that he has blue eyes. Just in the last day, an article following up on last week&#x27;s American Society of Human Genetics conference[2] pointed out that genetic studies have continually overpromised and underdelivered, and there are still many very basic issues of human genetics that are embedded in deep uncertainty.<p>As the article kindly submitted here points out, people are already demanding designer babies. They used to try to get those by looking for sperm donations from the Nobel laureate sperm bank,[3] but that project had disappointing results, and the sperm bank is no longer in operation.<p>Researchers on human genetics I know locally (who analyze the data from the Minnesota Twin Families Study) use a photograph of two identical (monozygotic) twins from Germany[4] (from a different source, I think the original medical journal source, rather than the blog I link to here) to show that although genes are certainly very influential on human development, environment, including differing choices of lifestyle, matters too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2007/09/11/craig-venter-discusses-his-genome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2007/09/11/cra...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_genome/2013/10/human_genetics_successes_and_failures_ashg_stories_of_disease_genes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_genom...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4700156"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4700156</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://thesameffect.com/check-out-identical-twins-otto-and-ewald/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesameffect.com/check-out-identical-twins-otto-and-e...</a>",1382986794

However, as I&#x27;ve encountered, a great deal of similarity over multiple assignments (and exams) between two students of the same nationality who sit together in class provides additional evidence of plagiarism.<p>So, yes, I agree a single data point of similarity is insufficient, but a history of similarity, particularly in complex projects, becomes more damning.",1382986772

You could also go to pesos from dollars at 10:1 on the black market.  However, going the other way is really difficult --  to exchange at a lowly 6:1, you will need to have a receipt indicating that you purchased at 6:1 and to fill out some paperwork... and even then, there are no guarantees.  With bitcoin, you&#x27;d run into the same problem since nobody will sell bitcoin at the implied government exchange rate.<p>For this to actually work as a money loop, you&#x27;d need to find someone willing to sell dollars at 6:1, which is unlikely since they would be losing money.",1382986748

When macros are used to add to the language, you&#x27;re acting, by definition, as a language designer. You can make good or bad choices. I normally think it&#x27;s good to eliminate boilerplate (e.g., the <i>lambda</i> calls in the examples) and to simplify things (passing bare symbols instead of strings). To my eye, the new coder actually has to learn <i>less</i> than if they had to remember to wrap with lambdas, or use strings: you code just like other parts of the language. And that&#x27;s a win.<p>However, bad choices with macros can definitely be made. Some people consider the <i>loop</i> macro ugly, because it&#x27;s a hairy ball of special cases with new syntax.",1382986741

6629026,comment,6626635,6626920,7,0,saidajigumi,,,"> What do you do when you have to use a computer without your customization?<p>As someone who has used an increasingly customized *nix command-line environment for decades, I&#x27;ll say that this corner-case occupies a vanishingly small amount of my time. I just doesn&#x27;t make sense to optimize for it.  I currently use zsh, which is frequently not available by default.  This implies installing a package, and I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any worse for fish.  I freely admit that my workflow as a developer vs. (e.g.) a sysadmin provides a greater degree of relative control over my day-to-day working environments.<p>I do have to work in non-customized environments from time to time. I find this no worse than using Someone Else&#x27;s Keyboard -- maybe there&#x27;s some clumsiness at first, but you soon get the hang of it.  If you switch environments frequently, the switch becomes unnoticeable.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve also put continual effort into portability and ease of deployment of my customizations over the years.  I can run one command on a networked host and have my rcfiles land there and be ready to use.  This is pretty easy to do with a git-managed homedir repo, especially on a provider like GitHub where you can fall back to grabbing tarball if needed.  I currently use vcsh[1] & mr[2] to manage my repos -- for that I use a bootstrap script hosted in an orphan branch of the same repo.[2] An efficient setup process of this type also makes it easy to integrate with provisioning tools, e.g. Puppet, Chef, or even just shell scripts.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://myrepos.branchable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myrepos.branchable.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/jwhitley/vcsh-root/tree/bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jwhitley/vcsh-root/tree/bootstrap</a>",1382986636

Look at all the naive genome wide association data sets that have revealed that primary DNA sequences are in most cases very poor predictors of phenotype.

And of course if you actually use this bandwidth for any length of time, you&#x27;ll run over your quota and they&#x27;ll extort you or cancel your service anyway.<p>More than anything, I blame the poor ISP market in the US on this exact attitude that nothing besides cable is sufficient. Infrastructure is just not at the point where we have the class of connection you&#x27;re trying to take for granted, and continually choosing only the absolute fastest provider while whining about their policies and prices is being willfully out of touch with the realities of current technology.<p>$55/mo will get you 12M/1M ADSL2+ from an ISP like Sonic.net, which is owned by a <i>real person</i> who even makes crazy statements like &quot;We delete user logs after two weeks. Your Internet provider should, too&quot;. You can double that by easily bonding two lines, and/or enable Annex M for increased upload bandwidth. And they aren&#x27;t particularly concerned with how much traffic you generate, either.<p>While these nameplate speeds are a bit slower than what you&#x27;re used to seeing in cable companies&#x27; large print, keep in mind that 12Mb/sec will let you download 100GB/day, and 5Mb/sec (dual Annex M) will let you upload 42GB/day. When you compare these numbers to the usage caps and expectations of cable companies, you can see they&#x27;re mostly selling an illusion.",1382983436

While companies that start out that way don&#x27;t encompass all startup growth, they continuously seed it through up and down markets to make the local startup ecosystems more resilient through economic downturns.<p>Without the universities, the best you can do is have market-fueled startup boom/bust cycles like the ones in Dallas, LA, NYC, and San Diego. NYC is trying to break out of this cycle with more economic investment in education and they may pull it off.<p>That being said, I think asking yourself why there isn&#x27;t a startup culture has a lot more to do with education/talent than it does with what technology du jour is currently popular a city.",1382983259

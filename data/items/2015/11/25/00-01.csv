Whether or not the product is to your liking, you have to be impressed at the level of consistent quality that they can apply to an industrial food production process.<p>Chipotle may be the ascendant totem of aspirational ethnic food diners, but more tribute should be paid to the original cultural assimilation cuisine.<p>Recently on my first trip to New York, I was blown away by the Manhattan pizza shops. There is a huge number of independent proprietors, and each has their own, slightly differing process for making pizza. It&#x27;s tasty food with lavish ingredients - meats, cheeses, fresh vegetables. Watching the queues at lunch, it was interesting to see such variety in customers - white, black, business suits, working class, etc. There didn&#x27;t see to be any dominant demographic.<p>That level of uniqueness made me wonder why pizza is not a more celebrated food. It certainly has the same characteristics that enable Tokyo ramen otaku to write blogs painstakingly deconstructing their meals. Perhaps once the current anti carb movement dies down, it will come back into fashion.",1448413168

(It might drain the battery, or shorten the life of the bulb... but simply being &#x27;open&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t cause damage.) The actual failure may have been due to lifetime wear & tear, or perhaps even atypical use prior to the rental period... in which case FlightCar&#x27;s responsibility is murky.<p>* The VW dealer price for repair is insane. Yet even though customer is displeased at FlightCar having slightly overestimated the radiator/themostat fix cost (by $200), customer expects FlightCar to cheerfully accept highest-possible cost for his own reimbursement.<p>Doing what this customer seems to want – generous reimbursement for something that isn&#x27;t indisputably related to the incremental use during the rental period – might not be tenable for the business even if everyone was acting in good faith. And if FlightCar had a reputation for generous reimbursements, it would also attract people acting in bad faith: blaming FlightCar for preexisting issues that could be snuck by the check-in/check-out inspections.<p>The difficulty of tracking and resolving such issues may be a fatal flaw in the FlightCar business model.",1448412928

10624685,comment,10619614,10624474,0,0,kemitchell,,,"I&#x27;d encourage you to read a bit more on arbitration. The more people know, the less they tend to see it black-or-white.<p>Arbitration is routinely used to place contract parties at an unfair disadvantage in dispute resolution. It is also routinely used to avoid and compensate for various shortcomings of the publicly administered, publicly funded judicial system, which takes years to decide most anything, without the benefit of any experience in the area. Arbitration also plays a roll in international disputes, especially for business in countries without effective legal systems. If you&#x27;re Russian in 1992, you&#x27;re not going to attract billions in outside investment in reliance on your local legal system.<p>If you&#x27;d prefer a high-level metaphor to start: It&#x27;s perfectly possible to believe folks should have access to both public and private mail carriers. Perhaps, as in the US, certain kinds of mail service should only come from the government; that&#x27;s up for debate. Maybe certain kinds of mail service shouldn&#x27;t be offered at all, like mailing children or dangerous chemicals.<p>Right now it&#x27;s possible to litigate publicly (in court) and privately (arbitration). Consumer and other less-powerful parties can agree to arbitrate, but courts are very skeptical of such contracts. On the other hand, if you want to change what public law means for the public at large, you have to litigate publicly. Neither do we arbitrate criminal matters, though some plea bargain processes come close, engendering much controversy.",1448412825

I mean, it&#x27;s one thing to break stuff to get in, or conspicuously pick a lock, it&#x27;s another to casually slide a card like everyone else and leave no trail other than maybe video surveillance or access logs showing the same card being used at two ends of campus faster than possible (which nobody will check until something bad happens and they go looking at that data.)<p>I had a similar experience at my university. I found easy unauthenticated sourcing of most of the data needed to clone the card of anybody by name. The issue number was the only thing to guess, but easy to bruteforce on something low-stakes like vending machines. The card was used for food, a debit-card-like system, automated door locks to semi-public buildings and on-campus housing.<p>With the permission and cooperation of the university security, I made a card of a high-level security guy (who could have been targeted using the public/semi-public org chart) and swiped into their datacenter where all the university data is hosted, along with that of some partners with sensitive data. Luckily the innermost parts need an RFID or something which I didn&#x27;t have access to, but potentially I could have tailgated or social-engineered my way into that. They weren&#x27;t interested in letting me research whether I could crack the RFID. :(<p>I was told my demo made a big splash, but IIRC I checked a year or two later and my source for the ID data was still wide open.

A major immersion breaker in most open-world games is the lack of detail in the lives of non-player characters. It&#x27;s impractical to manually create this content at any real scale, so I think that&#x27;s an area where AI would shine.<p>However, that isn&#x27;t terribly valuable without also being able to generate convincing conversation dynamically—and that&#x27;s definitely Turing Test territory. It would also help to synthesize that output in the form of an uncanny and unique human voice, which is also hard, and probably squarely in the same territory.<p>That said, I think all of this could be accomplished relatively soon, and without general intelligence necessarily being solved.<p>Of course, once general intelligence is solved (and doesn&#x27;t go sideways on us), it&#x27;s a good bet that this kind of thing will be nothing short of incredible. I imagine the Holodeck from Star Trek might be a fair approximation.<p>As an aside, utilizing general intelligence within interactive entertainment mediums for the purpose of creating believable characters may prove to be highly unethical.

This makes for rules which may or may not be good, but are definitely expediant.

For everyone who has gripes with the idea of suing a large corporation, I would agree that those gripes are justified, and further posit that the federal government is the largest corporation of them all.  It is hence impractical for a small or even medium company in most cases to fund a successful challenge to a constitutional infringement, and as the limitation of constitutional rights is considered an irreparable injury, it seems that we do it in fairly broad scale far too routinely for my liking.<p>Beyond all of the above, there&#x27;s a very good argument, specifically due to the increasingly oligarchical nature of our government that those regulations which are crafted at the behest of the large companies as competitive advantage to smaller companies are exceedingly unlikely to be challenged at all, much less overturned.",1448410919

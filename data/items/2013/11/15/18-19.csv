You said you have a strong math knowledge - probably stronger than mine, so I&#x27;ll just point out that you want discrete maths. If you&#x27;re comfortable with discrete structures - sets, trees, graphs, logic, recursions, not to worry. This course looks pretty solid if you want a look, <a href=""http://www.saylor.org/courses/CS202/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saylor.org/courses/CS202/</a><p>You said algorithms don&#x27;t worry you, but how much work have you done there? You want to know data structures - and methods for designing algorithms. Take a look here, <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/index</a> and here, <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/algo2-002/lecture/index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/algo2-002/lecture/index</a>, to see how comfortable you are with that content.<p>After that, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert in Linux. Maybe it would be a good idea to take a course in computer architecture - you get a much better understanding of what&#x27;s really going on. I haven&#x27;t taken either, but you could consider <a href=""http://www.coursebuffet.com/course/87/260-Computer-Architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coursebuffet.com/course/87/260-Computer-Architect...</a> or <a href=""http://www.coursebuffet.com/course/289/260-Computer-Architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coursebuffet.com/course/289/260-Computer-Architec...</a>.<p>If you want theory on computer networks, this course looks good <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks</a>.<p>More practically, it really depends what you&#x27;re doing. An OS course will probably introduce you to sockets and networking in C, but you&#x27;re probably not using C - it&#x27;s probably a matter of learning some APIs for whatever you&#x27;re writing in.<p>Also if you&#x27;re deploying web services, Coursera have a startup engineering course, <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/startup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/startup</a>, some of that could be helpful? It looks like they use Amazon Web Services for deployment though, so if it&#x27;s something you want to learn yourself I&#x27;m not too sure sorry.<p>Sorry that&#x27;s a bit long winded, if you have any questions feel free to ask :)",1384541914
6741378,comment,6740652,6741264,11,0,rayiner,,,"Without getting into the merits of restorative justice, I actually think the sentencing guidelines are the <i>result</i> of focusing on the offenders rather than abstract legal principles.<p>The basic purpose of criminal law is to establish norms for behavior. Punishing any given offender or satisfying any given victim is secondary to establishing a norm so 10 other people won&#x27;t do the same thing. This is a distinct concept from &quot;deterrence.&quot; The idea of deterrence is to force people to include the probability-weighted cost of a jail sentence into their cost-benefit analysis. A jail sentence twice as long means a twice as strong deterrent effect. However, given the practical probabilities of getting caught for many crimes, deterrence doesn&#x27;t really exist. Say 2 years for stealing a bike times a 0.1% chance of getting caught = deterrent effect of 0.73 days in jail per bike. The punishment isn&#x27;t deterring anyone. What&#x27;s keeping people from stealing bikes is the social norm created by making bike stealing illegal and punishing offenders.<p>This rationale for criminal punishment supports having crimes be punished in proportion to how egregious a violation of the social norm has occurred. That&#x27;s why punishing someone less for stealing food to feed a hungry child is justifiable. Within a restorative justice theory less punishment is appropriate because a small breach of social norms requires less healing, but that only focuses on the singular event. The additional justification is that a small breach of the social norm requires less punishment in order to maintain the norm for everyone else.<p>At some point in the 1960&#x27;s, people (mostly liberals) decided that criminal law should be about rehabilitating the offender. This led to a focus on the offender, rather than the offense. Hence three strikes laws, ridiculous sentencing enhancements or reductions for whether an offender seems contrite at sentencing, etc. Ironically, this thought process also led to an inflation of sentences, because people more easily rationalized increasing maximum sentences when those maximums would only be applied to &quot;bad people.&quot;<p>Of course restorative justice isn&#x27;t coextensive with the 1960&#x27;s idea of rehabilitative justice, so I&#x27;m not saying it suffers from the same problems.",1384541861

I&#x27;ve had better luck focusing on &#x27;singletons,&#x27; and catalyzing the formation of new conversation groups, instead of trying to work into an existing duo&#x27;s conversation.<p>A few years ago I stood alone at a big &quot;networking breakfast.&quot;  I barely knew anyone.<p>It popped into my head:  <i>Pretend you&#x27;re the host -- make &#x27;your&#x27; guests feel welcome.</i><p>Looking around, I spotted another singleton. Smiling, I stuck out my hand, introduced myself, and started doing the ask-questions routine (being careful to make it a conversation and not an interrogation).<p>A few minutes later, I saw another singleton coming near.  I invited him into the conversation and introduced him to the first guy.  Both  of them seemed glad to have other people to talk to (and when I ran into them at later meetings, they each remembered me).  Eventually I disengaged and moved on.<p>I was amazed at how comfortable that felt, seeking to serve others&#x27; needs instead of my own insecurities.

There&#x27;s nothing about dvcs itself that implies a lack of fluidity in a codebase, is there?<p>In a rough attempt to get down to first principles, CI means you need to be able to deploy a codebase at anytime.  Feature development means that codebase needs to be ever-changing.  Successful deployment means the codebase needs to be at a level of guaranteed quality.<p>This means that the quality of a &quot;change&quot; needs to be guaranteed to some level <i>before</i> it is merged to the deployment branch.<p>So right there, that implies the need for &quot;changes&quot; to be developed and quality-checked somewhere other than on the deployment branch.<p>I think that takes us pretty inexorably to the practice of branching the codebase, developing there, quality-checking there, and also merging <i>from</i> the deployment branch into the feature branch as the deployment branch changes.<p>So what&#x27;s left is qualifying what is meant by &quot;change&quot;.  Is it one feature?  A story?  A functionality layer?  That can be harder to decide on.  Agile says it should be a ui-focused story, but sometimes stories are epics (like a simple form submission that somehow implies several SOA services be set up to make it work).  So I think that means we can still do functional dependency analysis and shrink stories down to smaller functional steps, sometimes.<p>The key is to keep stories/features small enough so that they aren&#x27;t in progress for weeks at a time.  When you&#x27;re working on a feature and then are faced with a <i>massive</i> merge <i>from</i> the deployment branch, that&#x27;s where things get messed up.",1384541793

After learning the basics, I then would wonder how FF1 managed to change states from being in a tiled map and exploring the world into a battle screen and back again, which led me to more learning and eventually I ended up making a very shoddy Zelda clone that ran in DOS. I think I was 11 or 12 at the time?<p>Anyway, one day a long time after that, I was playing this new mod for Half-Life called Counter-Strike. It was fun, and I had started learning C and about OpenGL to understand a bit more about how HL worked itself. But on this day I saw a guy just running through de_dust getting tons of headshots. Watching his camera, it seemed he had superhuman aiming. Comments about cheating flew, and this was long before the game was infested with cheats. He also seemed to know where everyone was. How?<p>A few hours later I discovered he was using a cheat called ViperG. It along with another cheat called XQZ were the only known public cheats at the time. ViperG was open sourced on a forum called clientbot at the time. Since I was learning C, I was actually able to read the code. Back then, HL only imported mod client function implementations using DLL imports, so you could write a DLL that exported fake client functions while also importing the real ones from a renamed client.dll, which let your cheat intercept all of the client API calls. Most in ViperG were just pass throughs, but one would gather entity information from a drawing API and another would draw some text on the screen in a HUD update API, etc. It was almost no code but it rendered little &#x27;+&#x27; signs on every player through walls and would let you automatically aim at their heads. Crazy.<p>This is when I realized that I could actually take software people had written and break it to make it do whatever I wanted, and that&#x27;s when I feel like I really started learning things. Understanding how programs ran on my OS and learning how to reverse engineer came pretty rapidly. XQZ was closed source but had some really nice features, so I&#x27;d reverse its gl function exports and figure out exactly what it was doing so I could replicate them in my own cheat.<p>Doing what the author did here for modern MMOs can actually be a very difficult exercise, even for seasoned reverse code engineers. I&#x27;ve done it for several games, essentially reversing the entire netcode to write cheats that automate client actions, and there are all sorts of ridiculous traps I&#x27;ve seen to prevent you from doing so. One game even went so far as to require you to parse a terrain file and send the cell ID of your movement target in every movement packet, along with the absolute coordinates. This was slow as an iterative find process as a map had tens of thousands of triangles and you&#x27;d be sending these quite often, so naively you&#x27;d just loop over each triangle and check if your target coordinates were inside of it. This gave me a nice introduction into quadtrees and other algorithms that can make this operation asymptotically much faster. Yay learning.<p>To this day, I can only play a game so much before I get an overwhelming urge to break it. I think that despite the stigma of cheating, it&#x27;s a great way to learn. It&#x27;s comparable to taking something apart to see how it works and change it around a bit. Just don&#x27;t take it too far and ruin games for other people.",1384541388

6741264,comment,6740652,6741239,10,0,dmix,,,"Agreed. I&#x27;ve posted this on HN repeatedly, I believe the solution is taking a &quot;Restorative Justice&quot; approach (which is a concept gaining momentum in the legal world):<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice</a><p>> Restorative justice is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of the victims and the offenders, as well as the involved community, instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender. It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offence against an individual or community, rather than the state. [..] it shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.<p>So the question is would 2, 5 or 10 years in prison make any difference in making Hammond (and others in the community) stop conducting political property destruction? I doubt it.<p>Focusing so heavily on the punishment side of it is an incomplete solution and often creates a negative reactionary effect in the community.",1384540924

But I really can see this filling the hole in my phone that is streaming purchased content that isn&#x27;t available through the streaming service. The fact that iTunes (or Spotify, or Rdio) doesn&#x27;t have this is pretty disappointing. When I download an album off of Bandcamp, I have to download it to every computer I have iTunes on, and then sync my phone to listen to it. That&#x27;s difficult, and it means I have slightly different libraries on every device I own.

If the insurgents take out a couple of soldiers but lose a bomb-maker then they&#x27;ve done poorly on the exchange, if they take out a general or political figure but lose a few dozen suicide bombers they&#x27;ve done well.<p>Some lives are more valuable to a cause than others.<p>Here someone relatively smart, a high value target so to speak - though apparently not overly skilled in opsec, has been taken out of the game. That&#x27;s a win for the powers that be, and perhaps helps to explain the punitive nature of his sentence. Anonymous has a lot of people who turn up in crowds, but we don&#x27;t hear about them having a lot of high-quality hackers.<p>There are people that it makes more sense for them to sacrifice. To have the attacks that these people do executed by someone other than the people capable of making the tools in the first place.<p>They could do everything through encrypted channels, that could be made largely immune to traffic analysis, with the sort of really fluid cell structures that would facilitate. Just the first idea that springs to mind: uploading an encrypted steg&#x27;d message as part of a lolcats image on reddit that thousands of people are going to download - the noise to signal ratio would be enormous.<p>But then, insurgencies - in general - do a lot of things that don&#x27;t make sense when taken purely from the perspective of their cause. I wonder how that sort of approach would interact with the social dynamics of A, how they&#x27;d find people who were up for it. Whether that&#x27;s more what we&#x27;re going to be looking at if A gets to mature as an organisation or whether their largely ephemeral nature excludes that sort of distribution of risk.",1384540891

After pleading guilty to two counts of wire fraud from stealing nearly 2 million credit card numbers and spending $86 million in fraudulent purchases, Butler was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which is the longest sentence ever given for hacking charges. After prison, he will also face 5 years of supervised release and is ordered to pay $27.5 million in restitution to his victims.[5][22]&quot;<p>Also Albert Gonzales the leader of Shadowcrew actually plea bargained DOWN to a 20 year sentence:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gonzalez"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gonzalez</a><p>&quot;On March 25, 2010, U.S. District Judge Patti Saris sentenced Gonzalez to 20 years in prison for hacking into and stealing information from TJX, Office Max, the Dave & Busters restaurant chain, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies.[27] The next day, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to 20 years in connection with the Heartland Payment Systems case. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently, meaning that Gonzalez will serve a total of 20 years for both cases.[28] Gonzalez was also ordered to forfeit more than $1.65 million, a condominium in Miami, a blue 2006 BMW 330i automobile, IBM and Toshiba laptop computers, a Glock 27 firearm, a Nokia cell phone, a Tiffany diamond ring and three Rolex watches.[29]&quot;<p>Hector Sabu Monsegur is facing 124 years if he&#x27;s convicted on all charges, but with the current string of 10+ year sentences, chances are, his will be in that range as well I would assume. His sentencing was delayed for a third time until January 2014.<p>Previous to those, I think the longest sentence was to Mitnick who got 5 years. Even Kevin Poulsen got a 3 year sentence. Even the Lulsec hackers all got sentences under 3 years.

Young people also tend to have a slightly bit more free time, and are more likely to share things they use and like. And I don&#x27;t mean only teens, I also include professional, smart, rich, educated 25 years old who work in a startup, or own a company, or sold one, or had stocks in one and now are millionaires, and even become VCs, mentoring and helping other startups.<p>There are billions of dollars on the table that &quot;Old people&quot; companies are taking. Look at all the boring enterprise Java jobs out there, these people are selling stuff. to other companies you haven&#x27;t heard of, solving business problems you haven&#x27;t encountered and perhaps never will if you are a 25 years old hacker, because you will never want to go work for these companies.<p>Older people work there, and even if they have a great idea for a startup they are much less likely to do it.<p>1) health insurance - prime reason. older people tend to have kids, or in the making. Unless they have some savings, they can&#x27;t risk losing their health insurance.<p>2) family, yes, there are successful founders with kids, but it is much easier to start a company when you don&#x27;t have any. how many people with families move to SF for 3 months for YC and leave their kids and spouse at hime?<p>3) age bias. VCs look at older people like this - if you had what it takes, why did you get a boring Java job for 10 years till you decided to jump into the water?<p>4) Enterprise sales is hard. it takes sometimes 2 years of a sales cycle to close a deal. but when you do it can be a 7 figure deal easily.<p>5) What the article said about young tech writers, I agree",1384540125

I&#x27;m the oldest person in the group, have a 2yr old and another one on the way.

I feel like no job (unless it&#x27;s your own making) is worth the crap that dhh talks about in his post. Sadly with tech, it is definitely headed in that direction.<p>Ultimately, being FT is not a good thing in tech. You rarely work only 40 hours, there&#x27;s always pressure to work on vacation (such bs that one is), weekends, etc - basically the MS posters. The only way to avoid this is to be the boss (altho that has certain requirements as well) or be a contractor with very fixed boundaries (I simply say &quot;I have 9-5 M-F available only.

I think it&#x27;s especially helpful for hackers, because it basically lays out instructions for how to meet (and then exceed) people&#x27;s social expectations. A lot of non-hackers seem to have learned those skills in middle school, while many of us were busy learning other skills. Learning to &quot;play along&quot; and meet expectations is enormously valuable, in business and in life.<p>I had a bit of an aversion to the premise of the book at first, because it seemed manipulative to me somehow (&quot;winning&quot; and &quot;influencing&quot; people, ie. thinking of them as systems and trying to &quot;hack&quot; them) but I eventually came to see how narcissistic that was--I am not superhuman and cannot exert mind control, so any social &quot;hacking&quot; is really just using the system the way it is designed to be used.

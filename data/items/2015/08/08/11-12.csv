Elder Scrolls Online works well with it, and the game is an entirely different kind of experience when you&#x27;re &quot;actually&quot; there. Atwood might be entirely correct about it being far from mainstream, but did anyone think the first consumer VR headsets from Oculus and Valve were going to hit the big time? I assume they&#x27;ll do well enough to get to the next generation, and that content will improve over time. If you look at videos of people trying the available demos, they&#x27;re already feeling it... but everything custom made is short, as no major game works directly with VR.<p>FWIW, the DK2 screen looks a lot better to my eyes with a screen protector on it: it just barely blurs the pixels so there&#x27;s much less screen door effect than there is out of the box. I&#x27;ve not had the chance to try the newer, higher-res and framerate headsets.",1439035144

10027002,comment,10017613,10026830,0,0,pron,,,"> It&#x27;s not a monad defined as a specific datastructure in your language, but it is a monadic operation... IO in Haskell is exactly an effect type like &#x27;console&#x27; in Koka. It is monadic in Haskell, like in Koka. In Haskell it&#x27;s slightly more awkward because let bindings and function application are pure so you are forced to use monad combinators (or do notation) to combine them, but this is just a syntactic difference not one of any substance<p>I both agree and disagree, because that very much depends on the domain. From a mathematical point of view, whenever two things are isomorphic, then they are the &quot;same&quot;. But from a programming point of view, the two can be very different, as abstractions are psychological interactions with the programmer&#x27;s mind, and two isomorphic mathematical concepts can psychologically interact very differently with the programmer. Therefore, if I don&#x27;t have to &quot;think in monads&quot; when working with an abstraction, then the abstraction is not a monad, even if an isomorphism exists between them.<p>As it has been proven (I think) that any effect can be modeled by monads, you could say that all effects are monadic, and just like the mathematician in the famous joke, that&#x27;s absolutely true yet absolutely useless. In a programming language, abstractions are defined (and measured) both by mathematical as well as psychological properties.<p>So I think the difference <i>is</i> of substance because it has vastly different psychological properties (more than just thin syntactic sugar).",1439034646

There was some adequate pizza, and some truly awful pizza, and at one point we got so sick of the only food options being pizza or pasta that we flew a cook in from England to make us a curry. A local cook was tasked with preparing the rice, which he got wrong.<p>I suspect that out of the cities, the quality of food drops off significantly, and the range of foods, which was always pretty unimpressive in Italy, certainly drops off.

On the other hand, everything is terminated like an EC2 instance... Which really isn&#x27;t the case.<p>So, to begin with, most of their services can either be powered down (with chickenfeed storage costs that they could cover as part of the deal) or are outright free. Most things that you fork over money for in AWS can be disabled with some form of networking block. Have code in Lambda? Well, it doesn&#x27;t get destroyed, it just gets blocked. Have RDS databases or Elasticache? Block access, and perhaps power them down after X time (which saves them to s3, and block storage for AWS&#x27;s internal use is very cheap - <i>retail</i> s3 is 3c/GB/month). S3 itself also gets your access cut. SES and SNS just stop processing their queues. Things like VPCs and IAM are free to begin with. The costs of keeping these things running behind a block is trivial compared to the overage charges they already routinely waive.<p>And then we come to EC2... and the story still isn&#x27;t &#x27;must be terminated&#x27;. EC2 instances can be powered down and ELB access blocked, leaving the config all in place and the instance&#x27;s drive saved to s3 (which is where AMIs and volume snapshots/unpowered instances live). Yes, you will lose data in RAM, but you just get the account holder to accept that the machines can be shut down by AWS, just like already happens with spot instances. If the client <i>opts in</i> to capped pricing, then they can take that into account and design their system around the sudden downing of the instances.",1439034306

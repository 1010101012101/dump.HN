Depressing.<p>Edit: one thing reassuring is that it explain rationally how random people moderately clever and sometime plain despicable can become the head of very successful companies.",1341669287

(It's more effective because there're so many ways that the corporation can directly or indirectly put the old products on a boat to China or India.)",1341669228

I think that eventually it will be possible but ( and I am talking of 30 million $ planes) actually there are simply to many failures too many times ( once a year is enough and I assure you that potentially dangerous failures happen far more often than that) to have a fully autonomous plane flying with people inside.

4211625,comment,4210754,4210900,15,0,droithomme,,,"We have gotten phone calls from people wanting help running and installing completely unrelated software, in some cases on platforms we don't even develop for. We don't publish a phone number for tech support anymore and this sort of service request is more common than actual tech support on our own products, which is nearly always done through email. The people telephoning fairly often will say something like:<p>""I didn't want to waste your time with an email, I just have a quick question that won't take a moment. I am having trouble installing Outlook 97 on a computer I got at an auction, it's an SGI Workstation?""<p>""I'm not sure why you're calling, we don't produce or support Outlook, that version has been obsolete for many years, and was not written for SGI.""<p>""You were so helpful getting your software installed before, I really appreciate it, and no one else has been able to help me with this.""<p>""We don't support that, also it's not possible.""<p>""Surely there is some way. Let me read you the serial number of the computer plate. Do you need the Outlook license key?""<p>""I can't help you.""<p>This goes on for a while. I stay on the line mostly because I am amazed by the call.<p>Anyway the basic insight I have is that anyone with a reasonable request understands the information we have about email and forum support and uses that. It's only the unreasonable customers who feel sufficiently motivated to track down the phone number and make a call. As the parent post mentions, these sorts of calls often come in at weird early morning hours and weekends. We also get calls from people wanting advice in their life about non-support related things like where to go to university to learn to write software like we do or whether to buy a new car. Again, reasonable people understand that support is by email, unreasonable people don't and this explains why most phone calls are unreasonable requests. I still handle these politely, perhaps so I can later tell the stories to people as I am now. Maybe also I am a bit of a sucker for whackos!",1341669203

Consider that we have an oversupply of <i>bar-certified</i> lawyers, there is no conspiracy or collusion going on. What is preventing those unemployed graduates from entering your $250/hr market, charging $150/hr, and eating the other guys' lunches?",1341667102

Perhaps the ethical issue here is not the fees that lawyers charge or the licensing process, but the fact that you need them at all in so many situations.  The ethical issue is that there are too many laws.",1341667073

It's possible to tune an algorithm to achieve arbitrarily good training set performance, of which you can include the small ""test set"" evaluation, but this does not make a generalizable, practical tool.<p>Opportunities might exist if you have the opportunity to feature engineer with domain expertise in order to keep improving your Bayes error.

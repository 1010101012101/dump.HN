When they turn towards you, you need to be smiling and have open body language[3], and greet them with a loud, confident voice[4]. They aren't trying to exclude you; they just probably haven't noticed you, or don't know how to talk to you if they have.<p>[1] On context: my impression is that the louder the atmosphere, the more appropriate/necessary it is to use body language and body contact to communicate.<p>[2] Have you ever been in the way of a bouncer or glass-collector in a nightclub? They have a certain practiced, assertive way of getting your attention - usually a hand on the shoulder that isn't pushing you out of the way so much as alerting you that someone's trying to get by. It's like that. (Some bouncers and staff are less polite, of course.)<p>[3] Open body language is mostly about not having your arms between you and the other. If you're holding a drink, don't hold it in front of you defensively; hold it to your side, and maybe lower than you might ordinarily hold it.<p>[4] If you're like many introverts, your voice is quieter than you think it is, so you need to overcompensate for that.",1245815813

The Web succeeded thanks to the loose coupling between browsers and documents, allowing us to make browsers which behave the way we want instead of merely porting the original browser from TimBL's NeXT.<p>Writing documents which degrade gracefully isn't hard unless you do it backwards (scripted frills before meaningful content).",1245815522

Obviously what he did was wrong, but it was pretty clearly sloppiness rather than theft or deceit. (Edit: either that or a very clever coverup of a very stupid crime.)",1245814961

""Bah, typical Excel user with your useless eye-candy and summaries and obsession with ease of use.""<p>I wrote an article some months back about competing with OSS, which included some very basic advice like ""If you offer software for download, you should have a prominent button which lets people download your software"".  I did not anticipate this recommendation would be controversial.  I got some absolutely priceless comments about it.  My two favorites: users who can't find the software without a big ugly button don't deserve to have it, and technically disinclined users who are attempting to install software from the Internet are already doing something wrong, they should be getting it from their distro's repo instead.",1245814512

I think they would.<p>My simple rational is that you're going to have more support from the people and lower levels of the government if one can provide compelling evidence the elections were fixed.

The feminists would complain that it was a men's conspiracy to impose the old status quo. The far left-wing whackos would compare it to Hitler's youth. I believe that teenage boys can be taught how to shoot, and that they can be trained to use weapons in a responsible manner. An old drill instructor would be required to keep the kids in check, though.<p>Much of this PR nightmare could be avoided if there were no weapons. Martial arts would be OK.

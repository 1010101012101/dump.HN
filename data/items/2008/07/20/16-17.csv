Using your fingers to move the cursor is a lot more convenient, the mouse itself stays in the exact same place relative to the keyboard making it easier to switch between them, and takes up less room on your workspace, as it doesn't need room to move around.",1216572807

251458,comment,250704,251346,0,0,swombat,,,"Then I disagree. I don't think there are any new worthy ideas being come up with these days. I think pretty much everything we do is a refinement on existing ideas, and different approaches of implementation. All the really interesting ideas are already out there, and have been for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The process of their evolution has been one of evolution, variation and refinement - not of creation, not for a long time.<p>You fund many start-ups. How many have come up with a truly original idea? How many have, instead, taken an existing idea and given a new spin to it, or even just taken an existing idea and applied it to a new market? In fact, if you can't express your idea in a few words, is probably not a great start-up idea. And if you can, then it's probably fairly close to an existing idea. ""Search engine for parts"" (Octoparts). ""Job site for start-ups"" (Startuply). ""Automatic time-management tracking"" (RescueTime). ""Configurable, hosted e-commerce platform"" (Viaweb). ""Social news for hackers"" (YCNews). All potentially great businesses or worthwhile endeavours, but not because of any originality.<p>Obviously this doesn't apply to all intellectual fields equally well. It very much depends on your definition of ""idea"", too. But I think for a definition of idea that maps fairly closely to ""start-up ideas"" as well as ""book/story ideas"" or even ""wise ideas"" - all the good ones are out there for the picking, and have been for eons.",1216571634

As if that wasn't bad enough, they started drinking the kool-aid and spreading the hype about the OM phones being iPhone killers and gave their dev team _impossible_ goals. When v1 (the 1973) came out, it was pretty much useless but it sold out just because the community was so excited about it.<p>Fast-forward to v2, still a lot of iphone-killer hype (like that idiotic fsf article) and no working software, OM changed directions multiple times and the Qtopia abortion is a result of that, and almost everyone is disappointed, but for the first time you can actually make calls (if you run a non-smartphone distro). The community is now beginning to form and take ownership of the fact that the OS won't go anywhere unless they make it.

It's not even full ""censorship""- there's nobody stopping the creators of such an ad from putting it on Youtube, for example. It just can't be broadcast on TV.<p>To address your comment somehow- the law you cite is probably unconstitutional. It was struck down by the Supreme Court once before, before being modified and passed again. I doubt the present form is constitutional, since it obviously does restrict speech.<p>Ironically, you, me, and the far right are the ones who most agree the law is bad :).

There are a few things that could improve the execution:<p>1)  I should tell the site where I am searching for jobs only once.  After that, it should use this as a default.<p>2)  There is room for innovation on the <i>contents</i> for each job listing.  For instance, it would be cool if a listing included a profile of a really smart engineer who currently works for the company.  Smart people attract other smart people, etc.  How about space for a video 'tour' of the company?<p>3)  The location based search should be smart enough to give job postings outside an area if none come up (eg, searching for ruby in Los Gatos gives nothing, but the search could be widened to a 20 mile radius automatically for instance).<p>4)  A site like this would be awesome if it could figure out my tastes in jobs (based on feedback I provide for each listing I read), and use this to bring new listings to my attention.<p>5)  One general problem is I feel that I still have to go to 3 different job boards to be up to date on the more interesting opportunities.  How can Startuply help?<p>One final note:  It seems that you don't have listings from recruiters.  This is a good thing.",1216570309

Plenty of us get the occasional homophobic insults from jagoff motorists.<p>On that topic, I think another reason the Segway wasn't very successful is that it has few compelling advantages over a $300 bike-- it has the same speed, has a lower range and is harder to refuel, doesn't fit in that well with existing infrastructure, and doesn't get you exercise. The only upside I can think of is that, because you aren't exercising, you don't sweat (slow down riding your bike or take a shower!) and that it's high-tech.",1271347052

More users is not the goal of GNU/Linux. Making a better operating system for those people that contribute code, support other users, and LIKE the system is the goal. It will be a small number of people relative to the Windows and Mac worlds. That's OK because it is large enough to be self sustaining.<p>As a FOSS developer the number I care about is how many other developers there are, not how many users there are.<p>I agree we should have better drivers, but you basically have companies that do absolutely nothing to help or purposely discourage open source drivers (which for commodity hardware like network cards is mind boggling, at least for graphics cards there is a reason). I've also run into companies that say they are giving out drivers or docs for their hardware, but the documentation is wrong. It is far from easy.<p>And you say it much better than I can: "" I do think that you're missing the point if you switch to Ubuntu or any other free OS with the expectation that you can keep laboring in ignorance of what your computer does. Free software communities don't need such users, and while they may be happy to help them for a time, they can't afford to help someone who won't help themselves forever.""<p>And I really don't understand why this stuff gets pinned on Linux so hard but not on other operating systems. My Windows 7 install doesn't come back from hibernate without blue screening, and had issues with some of my hardware. Both are common attacks on Linux.

Once tenure has been achieved, generally after less than ten years of work, top college teachers face no professional risk and, by and large, teach three or fewer courses a semester.</i><p>3 courses per semester is a lot of work if you're doing it right, especially when you consider the amount of time research can take. 8-10 hours per week is a good estimate of the amount of time each class takes.<p>Also, very few professors make $150k-- those are the stars-- and they tend to be in their late 30s if not 40s. Academic pay is 1/5 to 1/10 of what it is in other industries (and yes, it's harder to become a tenured professor than to make $1 million/year on Wall Street).<p>American tuition is ridiculous, but overcompensation of teaching staff is <i>not</i> the problem. With tuition at $40,000/year for 10 classes, that's $4000 per class. If average class size is 25, that's $100k for 150 hours of the professor's work ($667/hour).

I think it's probably best if they're separate per-application hierarchies. The One Tree file system model is really aesthetically appealing to us hierarchically-structured thinkers, but most people don't seem to think that way.<p>Interesting to note how it's done on the iPad: Photos, for example, are stored in a hierarchy (in certain views at least; there's not a strong sense that the ""true"" scheme they're stored in is an hierarchical one), but no folder metaphor is used. It's just stacks of images.<p>Likewise, the ""folders"" in OS 4.0 are that in name and function only. They are represented more like the stacks of photos, though the objects ""in"" them are shown as tiled (with a linear view when tapped, for easier picking) rather than overlapping, though, in that case. But an opaque container isn't used.<p>So, in both cases, the objects are collected without the container being drawn attention to.<p>This may limit the number of levels of hierarchy that are possible (stacks of photos within stacks of photos would break the metaphor... not that people put real-life folders within folders very often), but most users don't like deep hierarchies anyway, and the extra hierarchy of objects being stored ""within"" apps helps mitigate that as well as segregate things somewhat naturally by type.<p>Of course certain tasks will always require deep, complex hierarchies.",1271344081

At some point, the console is going to win out and those 20 percent items, and tasks that you'd need a general purpose computer for are going to somehow change.  Either you'll find another way to accomplish the same general task or tools for the console will arrive that are ""good enough"".  So the question would be, does the console do enough of what people generally do to change the things they rely on a general purpose computer for?<p>Granted, the successful consoles I can think of are all TV related, and the TV has key advantages over general purpose computers for those consoles (bigger screen, setup to be watched instead of worked on, better sound, etc).",1271343985

Popularity isn't the point.<p>Free software communities don't benefit from simply having a larger number of users who are just as helpless as they were when they were using a proprietary operating system.  Having to learn something about the system (even something at the command line -- horrors!) in order to get it working makes you a better computer user, and more likely to contribute help to others who need it.  I don't mean this to sound like free software should be designed to ""keep the riff raff out""; on the contrary, it should be designed to make it easy for a newcomer to learn something he didn't know before.  But I do think that you're missing the point if you switch to Ubuntu or any other free OS with the expectation that you can keep laboring in ignorance of what your computer does.  Free software communities don't need such users, and while they may be happy to help them for a time, they can't afford to help someone who won't help themselves forever.",1271343903

In the economic models you refer, which nation(s) absorb China's workload?

I don't think I'm particularly special, I just don't watch that many old movies.<p>The point is, spoiling it adds nothing to the conversation: ""I watched the movie and <i>you</i> got this plot element that, while important to the film, is completely unimportant to your point ... wrong!"". On the other hand, not spoiling it lets anyone a bit too young to have seen it the first time around not have their experience of the film permanently altered for the worse. There is no contest. Don't spoil things, even if it's old as hell. It really, honestly ruins things for some people who are a bit behind the times and care about this sort of thing.",1271343682

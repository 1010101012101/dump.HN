It seems that auto safety was much more slow to catch on, and required odd forces to bring the topic to the forefront.<p>This also has an interesting interaction with a small startup essentially searching for the important metric for its survival.",1252367981
809957,comment,809890,809890,0,0,gk,,,"Not bricking stolen toys is a form of price discrimination. 
The fact that stolen toys are not bricked and therefore have a resale value creates an incentive to, well, steal toys. Manufacturers profit because people whose toys are stolen almost always replace them, so lots of theft means lots of additional sales. Service providers profit because cheap used devices mean more people can afford ownership, so lots of theft means lots of demand for connectivity, or electronic books, or whatever.",1252367964

While E is/was pretty cool, the mental overhead required to jump to it from Java (given the general pool of java coders) seems to have been too high of a hurdle for any sort of critical mass to develop.

809948,comment,809935,809935,0,0,blasdel,,,"<i>Here’s what Reed learned: everything done and said by a car salesman—the test drive, the patter about city mileage versus country, the talk about air bags and safety—is simply an effort to get the buyer into the room where my father went back and forth at Foley Cadillac. Everything said before the room is like the forgettable small talk around the keg at the frat party—upstairs, in the room, with the lights out, that’s where the true artist, otherwise known as the closer, is revealed.<p>The room is bugged—know that. A manager in back is eating a sandwich as he listens to every word you say. When a salesman excuses himself to use the bathroom, he is really going to talk to this manager: get orders, execute a plan. At the beginning of the process, the salesman takes out a piece of paper divided into boxes. This is called a four-square. He writes a number in each box: the price of the car, what you will get for your trade-in, the amount you will put down, the amount you’ll pay each month if financing, which you probably are. “[The manager] stressed the price of the car should be written in large clear numbers to give it a feeling of authority,” writes Reed. “He added we should always write ‘+ fees’ next to the price of the car…. Good penmanship is essential,” he said. “This makes it harder for them to negotiate.”</i>",1252367253

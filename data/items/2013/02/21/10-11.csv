That's normal behavior. In same way, if you stop someone at the airport, the first thought people will think is ""I am not a terrorist!"".<p>You right however that saying ""I am not a terrorist"" is a bad strategic thing in a discussion. It anchoring you to something bad in people mind. It would be better to say ""I am not the president of the air line, but I am a VIP priority customer for united"", thus anchoring ""the president of the air line"" and ""VIP priority customer"" to peoples mind.",1361444337

This is common at startups, and there was more to point #6 anyway.<p>Aside from that typo, confluence's points closely match my perspective. Just rational risk management. Understand the system you're you're getting into, without illusions. drusenko rhetorically asked if this all makes him sociopathic. (That is, an ideal rational amoral self-interest.) Frankly, I think that's a type error -- he's not sociopathic, but his corporation probably is. And that's just plain institutional constraint; startups already have a huge failure rate, even when acting in that kind of rational way. I am not a sociopath, but my corporation overall acts like one. With my support. Otherwise we court extra chance of failure.",1361444222

A bunch of marines with medics (or hydralisks) for example just kill the interceptors quickly enough so carriers aren't a threat anymore. Goliaths worked very well with their range upgrade. Psi storms work wonders and don't even need to be targeted that accurately.

Making a scene increases his blog's visibility and has a decent chance of resulting in corrective action. For him, this may outweigh being late for Baku.<p>As Francis Fukuyama notes, ""unlike money, which can simply be divided, dignity is something inherently uncompromisable: either you recognize my dignity, or the dignity of that which I hold sacred, or you do not"" [1]. Trading immaterial dignity for getting to one's destination on time makes sense for most travellers.<p>That is, unless you are trying to make a statement. Fukuyama continues: ""for democracy to work, however, citizens of democratic states must...develop a certain irrational thymotic pride in their political system and a way of life.""

5256704,comment,5252054,5253509,1,0,jongraehl,,,"??? If I may risk the typical mind fallacy, most people <i>don't</i> think in words most of the time. Just like typing or writing can serve as structure or canvas, imagining words is for special circumstances. For planning to say or write (and sometimes suppressing). For remembering something you heard or read. For imagining interactions or temporarily believing in hypotheses. For prayer, if you're into that.<p>(I have known people who talk out loud often enough about whatever preoccupies them that I must assume that they're in-their-head doing the same thing much of the time, so these people <i>do</i> exist - I just question if they're <i>most</i> people).<p>I do find myself remembering things I've read, said, or heard, when they seem relevant. I have vast amounts of ""knowledge"" that's waiting to be connected to real life experience.<p>That said, I wouldn't put too much stock into anyone's description of what their whole brain is doing. Why would we know? I find it's sometimes best to just pause, stop trying to steer, and wait for my brain to come up with something, no pressure. Just whatever comes up in response to a question or puzzle in the next X seconds (pick a small amount of time and commit to not act at all until it passes seems best).",1361443656

As an employee the primary thing you should worry about is not whether the company is going to be 100x or 1000x return, it's whether it's going to succeed at all and you are far better equipped to do this than you realise.<p>An investor's job is to catch the winners. An employee's job is to avoid the losers.<p>As an employee, your main interest is not in what the top end of the stock may be, you don't have a portfolio, you aren't doing ""black swan investments"" you are investing your life and your time. It makes sense for professional investors to go in even at ridiculous valuations because one win can carry 19 losses.<p>As an employee you do not have a 20 strong portfolio. If you start young you have maybe five or six swings at bat and then you'll have a mortgage, kids, family. The return as an employee simply doesn't justify high levels of risk, the main job is just to ensure you're a part of something that works.<p>So how can you do that? Ask the questions you know make sense. Are you working for company run by founders who can sensibly and calmly articulate why they will succeed. Do the people around them also believe this and do you trust their judgement? Does the company have a justifiable burn rate and is it on track to make sustainable money in a market that's not unreasonably small? Would you pay money for the product or do you feel your customers are being duped? If the answer to the above questions is yes then put value in your stock. If not then don't.",1361443198

If it's the passenger, kick them out, if it's the staff, likewise. In that sense I totally agree, but someone who can't even make eye contact is not up to this; so it's up to the airline weither they feel comfortable having weak staff on board of expensive equipment.",1361443074

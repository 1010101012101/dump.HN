It is factual, but performed from a perspective of an engineer.  An engineer not looking for loopholes and not looking for how to stretch the meaning of the broad wording to attach it to something else entirely.<p>Attorneys are paid to find the loopholes, and to stretch the meaning of the statutes to fit the desires of their clients.  Broad sweeping definitions just make it infinitely easier to stretch the bill's language to make it apply to unrelated areas.<p>If the bill was honestly and truly meant to be what it purports, then the language would be nice and tight, with no wiggle room to stretch it to fit something else.<p>For example, here's passage (B)(1)(i) of the bill:<p>> `(i) use cybersecurity systems to identify and obtain cyber threat information to protect the rights and property of such protected entity; and<p>The bill does not define ""cybersecurity systems"" - leaving this term open to be just about anything.  Nor does the bill define ""cyber threat information"" - leaving this term open to be just about anything.  So long as they are ""protect[ing] the rights and property"" of a protected entity.<p>So, with this broad language, a deep-level packet inspection system sniffing every ISP's users data streams looking for purported copyright infringement would be perfectly legal, because it would be a ""cybersecurity system"" protecting against ""cyber threats"" in order to ""protect the rights and property"" of a ""protected entity"".  Where ""rights"" is the copyright and the protected entity is a MPAA/RIAA member, and the ""cyber threat"" is that of supposed lost profits from supposed copyright infringement.<p>That's the trouble with broadly worded bills.  They allow attorneys to stretch them to fit something they were never intended.

3820068,comment,3817840,3819531,1,0,Domenic_S,,,"> It doesn't matter if you run a hedge fund, a VC fund, or a trust fund. A 2x return is a 2x return, and anybody would take it any day. Anybody who wouldn't has no business working in finance. Just because you assign a ten-year time frame to your portfolio does not diminish the return on that investment, so the return on your $50mm is 2x, not 1.1x.<p>This is your key misunderstanding. When the fund starts, you lock up the money for a specific amount of time (say, 10 years), and once the money's been in, it can't go in a second time. So if you're near the beginning or middle of the fund, and the fund was < $500MM or so you probably wouldn't take 2x on $50MM today, because that $50M will be out of play for the next (say) 9 years.<p>In other words, it <i>does</i> diminish the return on that investment, because that $50MM is now out of play. Every dollar gets one shot of multiplying, and when it's done it's done, as far as the fund is concerned.<p>If the fund is near the end of its life and for some odd reason they still have $50MM sitting in it, then yeah, it'd be a great move.",1334018389

3819953,comment,3818046,3819581,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"I'd argue the real problem here is that too many people are taught to rely on <i>shared</i> mutable state in concurrency.  Mutable state and concurrency mix very easily as long as you stick with something like message passing for your cross-thread communication.  Erlang stands out as a stellar example of how successful that approach can be, but it can just as easily be done in C.  Event-driven and client/server programming, as close cousins of the Erlang model, are concurrent even when they aren't parallel, and have given us a couple decades' worth of proof that good programmers don't really have a problem with it, and even mediocre programmers can manage it.  The point where everything really gets hairy when the word 'lock' gets introduced into the mix.<p>If we take, for the sake of argument, that the primary motivation for writing parallel code is some version of scalability or performance, then I don't think we should be so hasty to jettison mutability.  After all, concurrency is only a means to an end.  The real goal is performance, and it's generally much easier, if not more possible, to write performant code if you allow yourself some mutable state, however judiciously it is used.  The hash table example from my earlier post is an elephant in the room here: Hash tables can give near constant-time performance.  The closest anyone has ever gotten with a purely functional equivalent is O(log n) plus a healthy dose of cache-unfriendliness to boot.  If that must be the cost of pervasive parallelism, perhaps we should be reconsidering how pervasive parallelism really needs to be.",1334016334

I figured this out while I was driving down the street next to the downtown trail where I run, and I tried to point out to my passenger how going for a run is always a great reminder that I'm a slow, fat, horrible slob.  I say ""tried"" because at the same time I was saying it, I realized it wasn't true, and I couldn't even twist it in a way that reflected the truth.  The only truth in it is that when I go running, everyone on the trail who is slower or fatter than me is invisible.<p>I noticed instances of this much earlier in life, but I didn't generalize.

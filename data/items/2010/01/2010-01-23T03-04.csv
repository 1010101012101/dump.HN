1071323,comment,1070604,1070882,0,0,bmm6o,,,"> He kept saying, ""But so then you add that new number to the list!""<p>I think if you get down to it, this reveals an interesting point.  I think it suggests that the logic behind the proof wasn't made clear enough, that it's not a constructive proof, it's one of the first sophisticated proofs by contradiction that a student sees.  Since you aren't disproving a concrete thing - you are showing that some hypothetical number doesn't appear on some hypothetical list - it can seem very unsatisfying.<p>Also, why is it so ridiculous to try to add a missing number to the list?  There's an intuition that you're fighting with a proof like this:
0: Create an empty list
1: Find a real number not on your list
2: Add it to the list
3: goto 1
Obviously this process never terminates, but I think you have to think pretty hard before that bothers you.  After all, what is fundamentally different if I replace ""real"" with ""integer"" or ""rational""? (rhetorical)<p>Finally, students are comfortable enough talking about the ""set of reals"".  Showing that there's no such thing as the ""list of reals"" reveals that there must be some difference between a set and a list - but at the time this proof is presented, has that distinction been made sufficiently clear?",1264218551

I'm talking about the simple fact that Firefox users cannot view certain content that is being deployed on the web today (h.264 in <video>) because Mozilla has chosen to use the size of its user base to ""encourage"" the adoption of Theora. This is not freedom. This is stupid.<p><i>if mozilla starts accepting patented or proprietary technologies</i><p>Nobody is saying they have to.

For that to be possible, you first need to bootstrap the implementation, and to do that you first write an ""informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp"" in C or something, and when you've done that, you're self-hosting, meaning you can produce newer versions of your implementation that are more formally-specified, less bug-ridden and faster. Eventually you have an accurate and fast implementation of Common Lisp, which is a pretty well-specified language.<p>So there.",1264217981

They also don't consider it recouping revenue for the artist. All label obligations are fulfilled and are usually based on total album sales minus recording, production, legal and PR costs.<p>It's important to note that most contracts a label will offer, reward the music copyright and ownership to the label, not the artist. Artists have very little grounds to sue for anything by the time the label is done with them.<p>Unless you are Metallica, Radiohead, Prince or some other huge band that has fulfilled your 5 album label contract, and now have [a]leverage for a new more even-weighted contract or [b]millions to start your own label and produce and promote your own albums, it is likely you will sell your sole and your ownership of your music to sign a contract like the one described above.",1264217607

And if there is one intermediary who is oh so very ripe for being kicked into the gutter it is certainly the middle manager. How do we get along without him/her? To my ears such a question has the ring of ""how will we get along without cholera?""<p>So, here's some bullet points: greater individual autonomy/responsibility/return (e.g. profit sharing & equity); more peer relationships and fewer superior/insubordinate relationships (though not the absence of such), note carefully that this is not identical to a flatter hierarchy; more freelance-style and partnership relationships (whether across or within corporate boundaries); more reliance on leads instead of managers; more mentor/apprentice style relationships.

Well, it cannot be 1 because you could then cancel the 1's and 3 would become 0, but 3 isn't 0, its 2, because we just said so. 1+3 is obviously not 3, because by the same reasoning of cancellation, you'd end up with 1 equals 0, which it ain't cause 2 is 0.

Openssl implicitly uses a md5 as a kdf during encryption [1.1][1.2]. Cast5 requires a 128bit key, and the kdf helps stretch the user's password to fit this key requirement.<p>I can understand the confusion, as scrypt is typically referenced in kdf discussions. It's actually somewhat difficult to extract the kdf functionality from the scrypt source code because the code is geared towards single file encryption. See this post for a confused q&a with scrypt's author [2]. Wrappers around scrypt like this python package[3] have made the ""mistake"" of using the entire encryption pipeline when they just wanted the kdf.

A bug report is essentially a set of instructions for a person who knows how to operate the software, but not necessarily anything else about the user's situation to follow. Most people are not used to writing instructions without conversational feedback and have a hard time figuring out what information in relevant and what to leave out.<p>For a high-volume end-user project like Chrome or Firefox, a wizard/flowchart type UI probably ought to be the default, with a more streamlined UI available to people who have been approved by admins or met some criteria programmed in to the system. An example of the process a user might go through is:<p>What's the problem? -> A web page doesn't look right in Chrome -> Have you tried it in another browser? -> No -> What other browsers do you have? -> None -> Ok. Here's a list of browsers that run on your OS and where to get them -> Firefox -> Ok, does it look right in Firefox? -> Yes -> Do you know how to take a screenshot?<p>And so on until the user has likely provided enough information for a good bug report. There could be short-circuits in the process - for example, when asking if the user has tried another browser, a small link a bit outside the main UI could say ""I've tried another browser and I have screenshots from both"".",1360203065

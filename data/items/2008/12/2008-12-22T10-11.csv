There is a bunch of relative right ways - some more appropriate than others. Given enough vigor, perseverance, sweat, tears, luck and timing, the right team can make most things work.<p>The thing which quantifies how ""successful"" they are is the equity they walk away with. It doesn't have to be 100% (because 100% of nothing is worthless), but you sure hope it isn't so diluted to no longer be worthwhile.<p>I subscribe to delaying external financing as long as possible to build up the business and maximise the mileage of the equity (ie trading 10% when you have nothing costs more than 10% when you have a healthy/profitable business).",1229940447

406254,comment,406010,406010,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Why does PHP need to use crap like echo and all those dollar signs instead of something more universal?</i><p>This strikes me as a bizarre statement.  What's more universal than ""echo"" and ""$"", which are found in nearly every UNIX shell?  UNIX has always been the backbone OS of the Internet, thus a language designed specifically for that purpose would naturally bring along some of those conventions common to administrators experience.  (Technically, it probably happened this way in PHP because of the restraints of the way PHP began, but that's not to say $ and echo wouldn't have been natural choices, even if PHP had been more ambitious early on.)<p>There are many things to complain about in PHP, but these two conventions were not invented for or by the PHP developers.<p>I get your point, of course...but when you use examples like this, picking on what is very likely the most popular language in the world for developing web applications, it just makes me think you're really saying, ""Why does PHP suck?""<p>Why doesn't Ruby use PHP syntax?  After all, if we're going to agree on syntax, shouldn't the one that the largest number of people are already fluent in be the one we choose?  Should we go back to earlier languages?  Should Python have gone with C-like syntax, like Perl, since C syntax is far more common?  Who decides what the <i>right</i> syntax is for all languages to converge on?<p>I think I have to conclude your question is invalid.",1229940216

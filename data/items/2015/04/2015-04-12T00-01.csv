Those binary packages are managed by the pkg_* tools, which allow users to install, verify, upgrade, delete, etc., packages.<p>The binary packages are available on the mirrors if you don&#x27;t want to compile them yourself. You just &#x27;pkg_add <package>&#x27; and you&#x27;re good to go. This is actually the recommended procedure, and users are discouraged from using ports unless they really need to.<p>> Apt knows how to consume variant packages from alternate sources and then upgrade back into mainline...<p>If someone else builds a package (mtier, for example), then you can install that package from them, and then upgrade later to a newer / different version of the same package from someone else later. You can have as many package sources as you want just by adding them into the PKG_PATH environment variable.<p>If you want to build a custom version of a package - in the event that you somehow need one - then you can do that. This is equivalent to modifying the port, which you would do if you were personally updating the port to a new version (before the maintainer did it for you), or adding a new variant, or patching the port in some way. The resulting custom package can generally substitute for the &#x27;official&#x27; package, so long as you haven&#x27;t somehow broken it. If the mainline port is then updated, you can upgrade to it without issue.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to upgrade a particular package, then just don&#x27;t upgrade it - the system will not complain at you unless some other package eventually requires the newer version.<p>> Apt has an &quot;install from source&quot; system<p>Building from ports is literally building a package from source. The resulting package is the same as every other package, and will even be signed with your own package signing key (if you set that up). It can be cleanly removed, upgraded, etc., just like everything else.<p>The OpenBSD packages system is pretty great, and I&#x27;ve used apt. I personally find the pkg_* tools easier to use and more transparent than apt-*/dpkg, but I am sure this just boils down to familiarity. YMMV.",1428800366

9361507,comment,9360827,9361147,0,0,tete,,,"> RPM/yum and dpkg/apt are not perfect, but they are vastly superior to ports in every dimension.<p>After about ten years of experience with ports and apt (and some minor experience with zypper and yum) I have to say that this as well as most other statements you made are wrong.<p>I broke things with yum and apt, never with ports. Regarding knowing what port installs what. That&#x27;s indeed possible, the statement that it isn&#x27;t is wrong. On the port level itself you have PLISTs on the package level you have even more.<p>> With ports, it is likely you will, over time, end up with multiple versions of some things (libraries, languages, etc.) installed. This is common on Linux, as well, but the ability to determine what is built against which versions, and to be able to keep up with whether, say, an insecure version can be removed without breaking things on the system, is much weaker (non-existent, as far as I can tell).<p>Wait, what? Have you ever used ports/the BSDs? Actually this particular problem, being able to cleanly decide which version of a library or piece of software I want to use is one of the main reasons for me to use BSD in favor of Debian or CentOS. Actually that was the reason to switch from a Debian/Ubuntu setup to FreeBSD and we never regretted it. The worries about everything related to packages just went completely away with that change. It really is a main benefit of the BSDs in general.<p>Did you ever have to deal with multi repositories on a Debian based system, maybe using backports, maybe even requiring unstable branches. It can be a horror. One is constantly between software that&#x27;s too old to compete or unstable or when upgrading sometimes too new. It is an enormous pain and you can keep a team of sysadmins or devops busy trying to work around all the problems that appear when you do that using apt.<p>Even things like security updates often make their own problems. Especially when these things try to be smart about which services to restart. Either your server restarts while under enormous load and your infrastructure has a giant hickup that may lead to downtime or you update OpenSSL and things remain as they are.<p>Another problem is how packages often get modified, split, etc. and behave completely different everywhere.<p>One more benefit of the ports system is configurability. I set up a system like FreeBSD&#x27;s poudriere, have a simple, global configuration, specifying whether I want documentation with my packages, whether I want Xorg-Dependencies for my command line tools, things like which databases I want to use, but also and that&#x27;s probably one of the greatest things, whether I want my packages to be built for Postgres, 8.4, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 or whether I want to use PolarSSL, GnuTLS, OpenSSL, LibreSSL, just with one single option.<p>The port infrastructure prevents a lot of duplication of work. Many features added to it simply become available for every port there is. You don&#x27;t need some maintainer to have exactly the same setup and (compile time) configuration as you. That is a huge plus.<p>Actually many systems like Arch ABS to build packages are basically a ports collection themselves. Many ideas were taken by projects, like the RPM-based OpenPKG. None of them are as powerful as what the BSDs offer, though Gentoo&#x27;s Portage comes close.<p>Speaking about reliably rolling back versions. That actually is yet another reason for me preferring ports. It tends to work way easier than trying to do that in apt, at least when you want to do that in a sane/safe way. But to be honest, it is not the thing you need to do on a daily basis.<p>Another feature is to be able to hack into it, if it really necessary. You have way more, easily accessible possibilities to quickly change something. Try to do that on apt or yum and you will easily end up with a broken system. That&#x27;s what I consider fragile.<p>Also your statement about checks on packages is simply wrong. Why wouldn&#x27;t you be able to? Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t rely my security on that. Package Managers are no intrusion detection systems. If you use them like that you may want to overthink that approach.",1428799738

That&#x27;s a violation of our freedom to work as many hours as we want.<p>I do support you in that all of people shouldn&#x27;t <i>have to</i> work in order to meet the basic needs of life today (food, housing, and connectivity). Agricultural and industrial efficiency and automization has advanced to a point where we can provide these basic needs to 90% of the populace with only 10% of people maintaining/operating these machines.<p>A lot of people will continue to work 50 or 60 hours, because a lot of humans are naturally inclined to work. They derive pleasure and satisfaction from it. I would myself personally continue working, perhaps even harder than I do now, but would direct my efforts towards things that I enjoy more, and that are potentially more impactful, meaningful, and beneficial to society. Ensuring that everyone&#x27;s basic needs are met would give people great personal freedom to pursue what they want.<p>How would we implement this? One possible way is <i>basic income</i> -- although it might be beneficial to incentivize productive and meaningful use of freedom that basic income gives people. We don&#x27;t want a country where 50% of the population spends time watching soap operas, and eating junk food.<p>Just some of my thoughts...",1428799391

If you wanted to do newspapers, you&#x27;d want Quark.<p>While there may have been certain platform quirks that tilted the initial creation of those tools in one direction or another (such as genlock support for video for the Amiga), platform mattered far less than application, and early application traction in a niche would paper over a lot of other platform issues.<p>WYSIWYG output for printing was largely still an application issue, not a platform issue, for example. Exactly for those kinds of reasons, an application lead also translated to a platform lead for those kind of niches where people would buy the platform to support an application rather than the other way around. People would buy Quark, and a Mac to run it, not pick a system and see what desktop publishing would run on it.

Interestingly Commodore apparently choice PA-RISC primarily with the intent of being able to run Windows NT (at the time of the decision, the lower priced PPC - and MIPS - alternatives were not supported for NT) - something which would have been massively controversial with a lot of Amiga users.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Hombre_chipset"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Hombre_chipset</a>",1428798820

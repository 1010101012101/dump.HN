However, that does not in any way diminish the value of the metaphor, because the <i>vast majority</i> of people who encounter the word sharecropper think of the kind of farmer who can be evicted after harvest and often were.<p>Further to that, I <i>strongly suspect</i> that most of those who are aware that the practice has evolved since those draconian times read the metaphor and immediately grasp that the metaphor refers to the historical meaning of the word and can go on to extract value from it without belabouring a pedantic point.<p>I will go further and challenge you: When you read the above posts, were you unaware of the historical behaviour of landlords and sharecroppers? Is it news to you that this practice was so abused that the word has pejorative overtones even though the practice may have evolved in modern times?<p>Or is it simply that you wish to share with us the interesting news that times have changed for farming sharecroppers even if they havent for developers on proprietary platforms?",1316800575

Actually, those sectors are probably the ones that need disrupting the most.<p>There's two distinct things here: medtech/biotech and software.  The former is riddled with patents, government approvals, waiting periods and stonewalling by the very hospitals and insurance companies that are supposed to want healthy people, etc.  Software is easier: an easier EMR (they exist) might remove complexity in daily life for medical professionals, but I'm waiting to see a startup make an impact in the way of meaningful doctor-patient relationships, especially outside of a static, single clinical visit.",1316800492

Regardless of stalkers and people who browse your past for kicks, this is an insane utility for profiling individuals down to the minutiae of every day life. What's more is that it's a catalog, itemized down to the hour of activity on your Facebook. Yes, this has been available in theory for awhile, but now it's highly accessible and easy to find and scrutinize any moment in anyone's life (that is, if they've been posting to their Facebook).

I don't dispute that bulk messages can be banned, sometimes capriciously, by the big guys. My point is that for social emails, i.e. emails between people, the email system is a very open, free system. Overall, that's the kind of system I want to base my livelihood on.<p>To give a concrete example: a few years ago, I set up an email server in my garage using an old computer that was being thrown away at work. I used all free software. It successfully sent email. None of my emails were blocked. I engaged with my social network, (my ""friends"") using it. If my ISP had blocked my email sending, there were many, many other providers willing to send my email for the price of the connection. Given that spam cannot be eliminated, despite decades of trying, I think it's fair to say that I won't run out of alternatives, especially given that the email I want to send is innocuous.<p>By comparison, I cannot set up a Facebook server in my garage. If Facebook blocks me, I'm done. If that was my livelihood, I'm fully screwed.",1316800364

He pulled a postdoc into his office and they talked to me for about an hour on a huge variety of topics. He taught me the Y Combinator, gave me a pocket protector (same as the author's) and signed my copy of SICP. (Hal, unfortunately, was on sabbatical at Google at the time.)<p>What impressed me about Gerry was the incredibly wide variety of topics he could speak on, not just computer science and electrical engineering but many other hard sciences and I even remember him mentioning something about the ambiguity of ancient Hebrew. He had something intelligent to say about everything. A few other interesting points are that when he was my age (high school) he used his knowledge of chemistry to make explosives for fun, and he had a chair hanging from the ceiling he had built himself. Being around someone that knowledgeable and intelligent has the potential to automatically make you more ambitious, and it's something I recommend every young person do as soon as possible. (PG said something similar about showing founders how to be relentlessly resourceful: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=508048"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=508048</a>)<p>I came back and visited Gerry a few months later for a briefer visit. At the time I was deciding between colleges. He asked me about where I was considering and provided me the most helpful overview of the strengths and weaknesses of each of their cultures. Needless to say, he was a pretty big fan of MIT. ;)<p>He told me an interesting anecdote about Marvin Minsky that I haven't heard anywhere else so I'll put it here. We were discussing good procrastination. He said Minsky advised putting all mail in a pile, newest on top, and only processing the pile top-down. Then, once a month throw out the bottom half of the pile to save time. ""Anything important will come twice,"" Minsky said.",1316799701

Sure you can run your favorite <i>good</i> browser from the desktop but for all intents and purposes with as much focus they are putting on Metro they clearly intend for Metro to be the primary interface. Primary meaning the interface regular Joe users will (only) utilize.<p>The more we find out about Metro UI the more I'm <i>hating</i> it. Hate is a strong word, but in this case I'm afraid its deserved. Under the cover of its ""fresh"" and ""innovative"" appeal there are some really seedy forces like monopolization and censorship [censorship coming from the inability to sideload apps for Metro--everything must be approved and delivered through the store].<p>What Id like to see to resolve this issue, is a simple implementation of having Metro app require permission from the user to launch desktop apps. The permission could be granted on a case by case, range of time or permanent basis.",1316799181

We're disrupting the movie distribution space by bringing new movies directly to consumers via streaming online.<p>For consumers, we feature a single new unseen movie each day.  The movie remains on Prescreen for 60 days. Customers who purchase the movie have a 48 hour period to view the movie once they start watching.<p>For independent filmmakers, we provide a launchpad to getting distribution. Films are like startups in many ways - you get a bunch of great people together and work your ass off to produce an awesome product. Then comes the hard part - generating enough interest in the film to get distribution, which is analogous to getting enough traction to land series-A funding. Prescreen provides an initial audience for the film, and more importantly, provides insights into the addressable market.<p>We produced our MVP in about 3 months with 3 engineers, leveraging a bunch of newer tech including MongoDB, the Lithium PHP framework, and Cloudfront.<p>Would love your feedback on the product and the space.<p>https://prescreen.com<p>Regards,\nTyler",1316799053

We know that if Einstein's theories of relativity are not true they are at least very good approximations over a very wide range of scales. It would take truly extraordinary evidence to justify a conclusion about the falsehood of relativistic theories at large scales.

Separating the streams into high-signal deliberate sharing and low-signal 'ambient' sharing is interesting, but seems kind of fiddly/inelegant.<p>An obviously better way to do it is to auto-share into a private queue that you can then go through and approve for sharing into specific lists/circles. Maybe that's a bit too fiddly, though, and probably too cognitively expensive. I suppose it also creates an update bunching effect, where your updates come in bursts instead of a steady stream.<p>Either way, passive auto-sharing just seems like it makes embarassing situations too easy.<p>It also sometimes seems to me like Facebook is actively and deliberately trying to make human communication/interaction as reductive as possible.<p>[Edit: I think there's another angle to this that's kind of quietly subversive in a pervasive way: If auto-sharing of your various web activity is on by default, then you might have some low-level filter on your actions, because you're always a little bit afraid that everyone can see what you're doing.

I couldn't sell you the chips of wood that went into the MDF of your Ikea dresser for anything near the price of the dresser, though it's a major component.\n * The cost of assembling furniture on a large scale is greater than the cost of manufacturing the components.  Putting pegs into holes using a machine is a hard enough engineering problem (that's one reason behind surface mount electronics), let alone the rest of the assembly.  Of course, the way a piece of furniture comes together is different with machine assembly, but there is still cost here.\n * The volume of flat-packed furniture waiting to be assembled is a small fraction of the assembled volume.  This impacts shipping as well as warehousing costs.<p>Both 'build-it-yourself' and 'low price' are true for Ikea furniture, and due to their correlation, it's easy to pick the wrong one as the cause of success.\n(Of course, correlation does not imply causation, but as I said at the start of this comment, I think price is causing popularity)",1316797555

After a decade of working in the digital agency world, I left a well paying job at an agency in Los Angeles to start my own studio in early 2009.  Because I was fortunate enough to have amazing connections I managed to land large projects with UFC, Picnik (now Google), Microsoft, Volcom and others.  I was running the studio solo and operating as the creative director while I outsourced various roles.  The business was off to a great start financially, but the time required was insane.  It was full of 100+ hour weeks and frequent ""I know it's Friday, but can you have something ready to show us on Monday?"" emails.<p>During a gap in between two client projects in May 2010 I got an email from a designer at Tumblr asking if I would be interested in selling premium themes on their platform.  As an experiment I took a few weeks to design, develop and launch a theme.  Instantly I realized this would be a great supplement to the client work.  After launching the third theme, it hit me that with just a bit more work it could replace all the income from all the client accounts I had.  By October 2010 I officially stopped taking on clients and the theme sales revenue surpassed the client services revenue.<p>Officially I opened up shop as Style Hatch - <a href=""http://stylehatch.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stylehatch.co</a>.  Earlier this year I was able to hire my first full-time employee as a director of customer experience, and now I'm looking to hire a designer and developer.  As of right now we still only have Tumblr themes for sale, but we're working on a few new platforms to launch for in the next few month.<p>For the first time I was able to truly control the amount of time that I wanted to put into the business, as opposed to being controlled by client schedules.  With two young kids I have taken advantage of the success by taking plenty of half-days off to go to swim lessons, head to the beach, or just being there.  This summer was also the first time that I was able to take a two week vacation and completely unplug from email and work.",1316797261

3030680,comment,3029845,3029845,1,0,jrockway,,,"QA is the wrong solution to this particular problem.  The problem is that in Java you can call methods on uninitialized objects.  If Foo can ""foo"" and Bar can ""bar"", Foo can't ""bar"".  But if you have ""null"", then suddenly it can ""foo"" and ""bar"" even though it's not a subtype of anything that can do that, and it doesn't implement those methods itself.  Does that sound fucked up?  Well, that's because it is.<p>QA is nice, but it's a finite resource that you should save for things that actually matter, not stupid things that a computer can fix for you in 30 seconds.",1316797249

But with the rest I'm not sure I can agree.<p>Because again the Valley is a kill or be killed environment.  The assumption is that others will look out for themselves.  So, for example, if someone were to promise me something I'd ask for a contract.  If I don't get a contract I'd assume that person was planning to violate that promise some day.  Because that's how that environment works.<p>And I'm not sure it could be any other way.  Because the stakes are so high.  It is human nature for people to forgive themselves if they feel they're acting for a higher cause. So if that person believes their company will make them billions of dollars and make the world a better place then they're likely to forgive themselves for telling a lie here or there.<p>It may not be right but it's the way the world works  (and honestly it's why I don't live there anymore)",1316797232

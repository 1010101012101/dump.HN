5846085,comment,5845272,5845562,7,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>What really scares me about all this FISA and PRISM stuff is that they treat foreigners as essentially non-persons.</i><p>Something that struck me a while ago is that while most of the modern world talks about protecting &quot;human rights&quot;, the ruling classes in the US always seem to talk about protecting things like &quot;Constitutional rights&quot; or &quot;citizens&#x27; rights&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure what that says about their underlying attitude, but it can&#x27;t be good.<p>The trouble is, a lot of places have at least tendencies in the same direction, it&#x27;s just hard to see them if you&#x27;re a native and get to go in the &quot;EU citizen&quot; queue at customs or whatever it might be, so you don&#x27;t see how others visiting your country are treated even from the moment they arrive. And since typically those outsiders have no direct influence on policy in places they visit, there is no natural political incentive for each country&#x27;s government to treat them as much more than a source of revenue for the tourism/education/commercial sector.<p>With the rise in modern times of ubiquitous international communications networks and relatively quick and easy physical travel between countries, unfortunately this seems to be a race to the bottom, with a lower bound determined only by the point at which people actually stop visiting/communicating with your country, which as a practical matter is going to be difficult for many people to do.",1370721307

To the extent that the USA publicizes what it does, people in other countries around the world will get concerned and develop alternatives that are not subject to US jurisdiction.  Alternatives developed for legitimate reasons by non-criminals then provide options for terrorists to use that are hard for US authorities to monitor.<p>Let me give a specific example.  Around the world, terrorists are forced to use sites like Facebook to promote their views because that is where they will find the people that they want to convince.  They take precautions, but they are still forced to use the tool, and it is still easy for them to slip up and get caught.<p>If, however, distrust of the USA had pushed the people that they want to convince to social networks based outside of the USA, then the exact same terrorists could use those networks in the exact same ways and it would be much harder for the US to capitalize on those inevitable small mistakes.",1370721293

If an employee provides value X and receives wages X-10, the amount of exploitation is 10.<p>However, depending on who you talk to, workers are not &#x27;exploited&#x27; in a loose sense because they can move to another organization that pays the prevailing wage.

Laws limiting the radius of his free activity multiply year by year: It is now practically impossible for him to exhibit anything describable as genuine individuality, either in action or in thought, without running afoul of some harsh and unintelligible penalty. It would surprise no impartial observer if the motto In God we trust were one day expunged from the coins of the republic by the Junkers at Washington, and the far more appropriate word, verboten, substituted. Nor would it astound any save the most romantic if, at the same time, the goddess of liberty were taken off the silver dollars to make room for a bas-relief of a policeman in a spiked helmet. Moreover, this gradual (and, of late, rapidly progressive) decay of freedom goes almost without challenge; the American has grown so accustomed to the denial of his constitutional rights and to the minute regulation of his conduct by swarms of spies, letter-openers, informers and agents provocateurs that he no longer makes any serious protest.<p>That was written by H.

If you say communists are members of the organisation called Communist Party (including main - USSR - party and foreign branches) and terrorists are members of an organisation like Al Qaeda that has terror as its tactics - then yes, they are - or, more correctly, were - nearly equivalent. Communist Party&#x27;s official goal - at least back in the middle of the last century where it was at the peak of its power - was the overthrow of the capitalist governments, or at least sufficient weakening of them to render them unable to interfere with the Party&#x27;s goals. In the service of this goal, they did not hesitate to use violence, murder and any other criminal activity. They also waged a multitude of actual wars in many places, including against the US and US allies. Of course, not every rank Communist Party member was engaged in active violence - but also not every rank member of terrorist organisation blows himself up in Baghdad market or flies a plane into a New York building. There are many supporters and enablers that contribute their part to make the final strike possible - by giving money, material support, logistics, cover, etc.<p>Of course, now that communist parties are mostly a sad joke, the equivalence is absent, but back in the day I would say being a communist - especially outside of Communist block were you didn&#x27;t have much choice and also almost always did not possess relevant information to make correct conclusions - was not much different on the substance than being, say, Hamas supporter now, even though I realize many people did not understand that.

Mozillas IonMonkey and Googles Crankshaft are examples of these DFG compiler.&quot;<p>&quot;DFG&quot; usually refers to some sort of dependence graph. What IonMonkey and Crankshaft have is a traditional CFG (control flow graph) in SSA form. That means the code is represented as a set of straight line code paths (basic blocks) connected edges in a graph representing possible control-flow transitions. The instructions are in SSA form, which means that each variable is assigned only once and pseudo-instructions called &quot;phi instructions&quot; are used to merge results when a basic block is accessible from multiple predecessors blocks, both of which might assign the same variable. A &quot;syntax tree&quot; is different yet. It&#x27;s a higher level representation that preserves the syntactic structure of the code. For example, it represents loops and &quot;if&quot; statements as nested elements in the tree. Translation to a CFG throws away most of that information (e.g. reducing loops to simply control flow edges in the CFG).<p>For a (relatively) approachable set of materials on the subject, see: <a href=""http://www.cs.rice.edu/~keith/512/2011/Lectures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~keith/512/2011/Lectures</a>.

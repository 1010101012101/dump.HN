I see this problem all the time in my own code and that of my colleagues: callbacks that have been registered either more or less times than the author of the code expected. Usually more times.<p>This can manifest itself in many ways. Usually in the form of a UI element being displayed more than once, but often more subtly such as a HTTP request being sent more than once. Often the bugs only manifest themselves after a certain sequence of actions, for example: click this UI element, check this radio box, then hit submit and watch the net tab.<p>It's so often the root cause of Javascript bugs that if I or somebody else on my team has a Javascript problem, I often start by asking myself if it looks like it could be this.

You must remember that democracy is governance ""by the people, for the people"", not governance by some arbitrarily selected subset of the people. There <i>is</i> an age below which the majority of people are unable to make informed decisions about political representation (either due to lack of understanding or pressure from third parties like family), but I'm not convinced that 18 is that age.<p>Mind you, age cutoffs aren't the only way of tackling this problem.<p>> I don't know about you, but I learn more every year, so I imagine by the time I'm 75, I'll know at least three times as much as I know now.<p>Unlikely. Net knowledge growth rate usually decreases significantly with age. You'll likely accumulate more knowledge between now and when you're 75, but certainly not <i>three times more</i>[0]. Ask a 75 year-old ;-)<p>> Nor do I think being in school adequately prepares or informs anyone to be a citizen.<p>I couldn't agree more. In fact, that was the point of my proposal.

One is, as you mentioned, involvement in the current system in a positive sense (steering in the right direction). Another is involvement in the system in a negative sense (destruction of it). The third is abandoning the system and using something else altogether.<p>The last option has the side effect of bleeding the existing one dry through inaction (within the boundary of the current system). It is similar to a software fork. We have seen many a project where the ones in charge have become rigid enough in their ways that, for all intents and purposes, the cost and probability of convincing them outweighs the cost of detaching from the infrastructure and moving in a new direction. For example, XFree86 and X.Org.<p>An issue that we face with activism is that the structure in place is supported by individuals with orders of magnitude more wealth and influence than what the activists have access to. This is evident in the case of Mr. Swartz where he was rapidly running out of money to fight his battle in court. We are at a disadvantaged position in that sense.<p>As such, every [insert your unit of currency] we pay in taxes go towards feeding the policies we so emphatically disagree with. With a nod to The Art Of War, a valid tactic in such a case is to starve your enemy and wage a war of attrition - in other words, reduce their material wealth while increasing our own. The end result is that nobody gets hurt yet they slowly lose their influence and the new guard have the opportunity and resources to build theirs.",1358072116

It sounds sound objectively empty, and you could easily be depressed in addition to that, but ""empty"" isn't the worst thing in the world, and isn't permanent, unlike death.<p>Why not just contract (so the 6mo thing isn't a problem), and ramp down the coke/liquor.  Other than that, it sounds like things will get better with time, just a few years.  Also it sounds like you're in the UK or Europe; GTFO and move to the US or something.<p>Hollywood or LA is a bad idea; SF or NYC if you want to be a SW engineer (which will probably make you happier and more fulfilled than being Lindsay Lohan).",1358071435

People who voluntarily affiliated with the Nazis suffered a permanent black mark on their reputations, even when they were not aware of what was going on at the time. Those who, after the extent of their evil actions were known, continued to choose to be affiliated with them, were considered exceptionally vile.<p>Those retaining voluntary affiliation with MIT after these events are vile. I choose, as a matter of personal morality, going forward to have nothing but disgust towards them and will not cooperate or affiliate with them anymore than I would with Neo-Nazi Skinheads. Those who had affiliation with MIT in the past, such as graduated students, provided they disavow all connection or affiliation with this organization might be redeemed, just as Nazi youth who have since disavowed their affiliation have become tolerable. The affiliation though will always be a black mark on someone's record regardless of whether they knew the details of the evil committed by their organization.",1358071433

5050430,comment,5048699,5048699,2,0,Elle4,,,"I found on the Internet that Steven P Heymann was honored at an awards ceremony by Eric Holder. Prior to the year 2010, there's not that much on Heymann from a cursory search. But he was moving up by busting cybercrime in concert with Secret Service Agents and FBI. The power-boys club. And certainly enjoying it. \nI found evidence of intent to misrepresent Aaron Swartz when they referenced him as ""not attending MIT but enrolled in an unrelated Boston college."" They deliberately concealed the fact that Aaron was at Harvard, to make sure that he was not viewed in any way favorably in this report of their indictment. I read the indictment and it makes every minor step into a hyped depiction of criminality. That is a legal tactic and technique, designed to persuade towards the impression of guilt.<p>Strategies are a collaborative effort in law enforcement.\nWhile I do not know much about these LE agents, I do know that they intended to destroy him, exploit his history of depression (which was common knowledge and surely part of a file work-up) and put him in Federal prison at age 26 and not able to be released until he was 76 years old. As I stated elsewhere, in many states, murders and pedophiles do not face that scope of incarceration. This was more of a targeting than a criminal prosecution. They has just come off a highly awarded prosecution and unfortunately Aaron was next in line for them to reap more awards in a ceremony. I am so sad this young man was overwhelmed by the horror of the circumstances.\n    I hope there is ultimately a WIKI each for Steven P. Heymann and his Director, Carmen Ortiz, so that their impact on the life of Aaron Swartz in the name of ""justice"" stands as the award they get from the public.<p>In effect. Aaron Swartz was given the death penalty for being a freedom fighter. His love of freedom was expressed in radical creativity and breaking down artificial barriers.

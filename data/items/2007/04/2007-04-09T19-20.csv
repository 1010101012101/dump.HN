10946,comment,10898,10903,0,0,brett,,,"I think it's an interesting point, but using Rails doesn't mean you have to structure your business like 37 Signals. I <i>did</i> read Getting Real, but with a grain or two of salt. It had some really good points, but understanding their point and trying to emulate their business structure (as they suggest you should) are different things. <p>Busting your ass and forming a company with a larger growth potential is still an option. It makes things riskier, but some people are fine with that. <p>The point of this really should have been that you need to be cognizant of the type company you are creating, realistic about its chances for success and aware that VC funding is only a means to an end.

10944,comment,10928,10931,0,0,boris,,,"I think it depends at what stage you are. If you are at the beginning then the answer is in the (conservative) estimate of how long it will take you to start getting some real money in. This can be very tricky to get right so be very conservative.<p>If you are already at a stage where you have some cash inflow from sales then I would say 6 months reserves is what you need. If you see that you have more than enough cash in the bank to last you 6 months without any sales then I would say expand.",1176147941

I often ask myself this so as to know that I am always following my hopes and dreams rather than following money.",1176147855

Or anyone with an ""I have all the answers, everyone else must be crazy or a moron because christ look at what they're doing"" attitude?<p>People use Ruby on Rails and still go after VC funding might just do so because <i>they need it</i>.<p>Or maybe not!  Maybe they want some sort of prestige, or maybe they're scared, or maybe they just want the experience. Who cares?<p>There is such a loud din on the Internet about the right method to follow, or in this case the right ""wheels"" and the right ""car"".  Most of these articles do not reference any real supporting research, but instead rely on the author's vague intuition.  The author of this article, Giles Bowkett, is talking about people who haven't failed yet - so who's to say if their picking up a serial entrepreneur founder wasn't a wise decision?<p>My computer chair advice: use your own brain.  Precisely identify the problems you need to solve and the questions you need to answer.<p>For example, one of my problems is that it's difficult for me to focus on side projects in my spare time while doing client work.  To solve this problem I'll need seed funding so that I won't have to do client work while I work on the project I really want to do.  Thus, I've applied to ycombinator (and have experienced 7 days of stomach churning apprehension hoping I'll be accepted). This doesn't make me illiterate, nor does it mean I have to go memorize Getting Real. It just means I'm relying on my own judgment.",1176147847

10938,comment,10875,10875,0,0,dhouston,,,"if you're thinking of developing a web app in lisp but haven't looked at python or ruby, you might consider them -- remember, it's not just the raw language but also the surrounding infrastructure, and python (django, turbogears) and ruby (rails) have arguably much more developed frameworks, and also arguably have most of the interesting language features that would draw you to lisp in the first place.<p>the point is the language is only one piece of the equation -- you want to be spending your time developing your app, not rolling your own supporting elements (templating systems, init scripts, form validators, sql bindings/mappers, etc.) and of course i'm sure others will point out reddit's switch from lisp to python.",1176147475

Of course, then I explain to them that while this <i>could</i> make us really rich, it also has tremendous risk and that I start start-ups FIRSTLY because it is my passion before anything else. At that point, almost everyone I know just finds it easier to maintain their good GPA instead of risk their GPA and degree for a start-up.<p>A good test I have is asking someone what they would do if they are taking an exam and find out midway through that their high traffic server and website is down.

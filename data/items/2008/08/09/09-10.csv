271578,comment,271437,271532,0,0,qw,,,"I agree. I do most of my work with my desktop anyway, so if I'm going to buy a new laptop I will make sure that it is <i>portable</i><p>I once bought a 15.4"" heavy Dell laptop, but I ended up not using it because I couldn't be bothered to drag it around. Now the laptop is 100% stationary since it given to my mother to browse the web.",1218275071
271577,comment,271560,271560,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think it's way too early for an API, and here's why:<p>- API's are generally only interesting if there are already some users, accounts, etc. to interact with.<p>- API's are not a main feature of the site (I could be wrong here of course) and are quite a way down the list. Fix the obvious problems first. I searched for Dire Straits and got no results.<p>- API's aren't used by a lot of people.<p>Basically what I'm saying is that you should get your priorities straight: An API has no value before the rest of your site works well, and has a lot of users.",1218274948

271574,comment,271247,271418,0,0,qw,,,"I don't know if you are trying to be funny, but downmod'ing a comment because you disagree with it is not acceptable.<p>Modding should only be used to improve a discussion, and in a discussion it is very common that people have different ideas. So when you downmod a comment, you are actually trying to remove it from the discussion and therefore damaging the discussion.<p>Only downmod comments that hurts the discussion",1218273946

271570,comment,271437,271561,0,0,Erwin,,,"I suspend my desktop nightly (which saves about $100/year).<p>I have SSH sessions to 6 machines: they just run while:; do ssh -t hostname screen -dR. After a resume, a ""killall ssh"" kills the broken connections and starts a new one which will bring up exactly the same terminal as before, due to screen.<p>Depending on how long you suspend for the SSH sessions might still work (assuming you get the same IP address, and there's no NAT with short timeouts, and there's no SSH timeout configured).",1218273474

271568,comment,270809,271337,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>It's true of painters, but not mathematicians.</i><p>I'm not sure about that.  The words ""homeless drug addict"" don't exactly bring ""mathematician"" to mind, but thats' exactly what Erdos was, and he certainly qualified as one of the best mathematicians of the 20th century.<p>EDIT: Oops, it wasn't methamphetamine; it was dl-amphetamine and methylphenidate.  Somehow my brain squished those two together.",1218273025

Flimsy as hell, and it's keyboard is unusable.\nI know this, b/c I was shoping for a mac a couple of months ago.<p>You have to go for MCB Pro in order to get anything usable with macs, for which you have to shell at least 2k.  Or go the iMac route.  Either way, it is much more expensive than you can get out of pc.",1218272934

They overly simplify something so that it 'feels' right to the masses, when in actual fact it may not be.<p>Going for a popularist vote rather than forming a cohesive argument.",1218272641

If so, you would want it to be a transaction so that the cache and database is not out of sync.<p>Maybe a write cache, like on hard drives with write back caching. If you first wrote the update to a cache (queue of updates).

820199,comment,820094,820094,0,0,mustpax,,,"The more play around about Erlang, the more it makes absolute sense. This is a concurrency done right. And I say this having done concurrent programming in Java and C (both pthreads and LAM/MPI).<p>The share-nothing, message passing paradigm beats the pants off Java concurrency. Threadpools and monitor based locking is fine if only 10% of your codebase is going to be concurrent, but it gets old fast.<p>MPI is pretty cool. LAM is a decent implementation. But as with any C API, there is a lot of low-level cruft to doing it right. pthreads is both cumbersome and fragile. Also kernel level threads, while they have scheduling benefits, tend to be more expensive to spawn/kill.<p>Erlang really abstracts away all this messiness and provides non-blocking send and selective receive with message buffers. If only it had better string literals. (Implementing infinite loops with infinite recursion also gives me chills. But then I guess you couldn't implement a while loop with single value variables.)",1252857185

820184,comment,819983,820167,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think you've never learned UML.<p>UML is a tool, a language. It's not a process, nor does it require that you specify anything. It's just a way of talking at a technical level.<p>I've been in the software field for 25 years delivering production code in a lot of venues. I <i>always</i> use UML as a way of doodling and talking about the way we're going to attack a problem.<p>Remember the four Cs of modeling: communication, coordination, collaboration, and consensus. There is a 5th C, Control, but it's bad medicine. Once you think that UML controls stuff, you run off in to architect astronaut land drawing lots of complicated diagrams with lots of little details.<p>That's what people think of when they think of UML, and it's about the furthest thing from the truth as you can imagine.<p>Just to rant a little bit more, a couple of years ago I wrote an agile project management tracking tool. As part of that, my customers and I had a 30-minutes requirements meeting. From that I created an analysis model. From that I created a database and a DAL. The whole process took about 2 hours. When people wanted changes, I could change the model and have the database and code change in 5 minutes. It left me to work on the UI and Business Logic and not be wiring stuff up everywhere.<p>UML can be nothing more than a bunch of boxes with arrows between them. In fact, 95% of UML is never or very rarely used by effective projects.<p>Tools can be very useful or they can cut your arms off.  Doesn't make the tool bad or good. It's just a tool.",1252856331

The address book does not become good magically, because it is rendered as HTML page.<p>To finalize my point, the default state of software is ""crap"". Anything else must be engineered on top of the underlying ""crap"".

820179,story,,,5,4,cousin_it,"Ask HN: Flash game devs, why don't you cover other people's games?",,"So, I was wasting my time yesterday and stumbled upon this little Flash game: http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/ . The author says it was made in just five days, but it's extremely well-balanced and hits the right emotion perfectly. This got me thinking: why don't Flash game developers make cover versions of other people's games that they adore, like musicians do with songs? Faithfully reproducing a good piece of work, capturing all the little details and maybe fixing the little shortcomings, sounds like the perfect workout for technical skills involved in game development.<p>------<p>For example, here's a short list of minor details about Canabalt that I'd fix if I were making a cover:<p>- When the character hits the void below a crane, it shouldn't stop him like a wall.<p>- When the character hits a crumbling building and falls, the building should continue crumbling instead of freeze.<p>- The jump button should be a little less twitchy, because right now it's too hard to reliably make the smallest possible jump.<p>- The randomly generated map shouldn't include jumps into windows below the current roof level, because judging from Internet comments, this rare situation reliably kills most players regardless of experience.<p>- The music shouldn't contain those long lulls every now and then.<p>- Remove the falling rocks from the bomb death animation, they look lousy.<p>Note that none of those are new features per se. New features are things that require creativity, and they sound more like this:<p>- Add a speed indicator.<p>- Replace bombs with hostile robots digging from below or falling from above, with identical mechanics.<p>- Add the option of jumping into a friendly gunship and escaping at the 5km, 10km, 15km marks etc.",1252856142

It is hardware (e.g., waterproof button worn around the neck, communicating wirelessly to a base station which includes a specialized loud speaker phone) plus a data-rich monitoring service.  When the button is pushed, the base station connects 24/7 to a service rep who can use the loud speaker phone to converse with the wearer.  In case of emergency, the rep has a list of nearby friends and possibly distant family to notify, and also has prepared data on hand to summon the correct local emergency services and tell them how to gain access.  Monitoring services offer other functions, including calling the senior's base station regularly just to check in and chat briefly, or calling to prompt and check on specific medication.  Additional hardware is available, such as motion detectors which activate the base station in case of unusual or missing activity, and multiple units to cover larger living spaces.  A lot of development has gone into solving this specific problem, so possibly specialized service would work better than just an intercom.",1252856056

However, I suspect these small groups are far more common.

I would be annoyed if someone wasted extra time (and, likely, money) on a UML-aware tool, when it would have been faster and as useful to just sketch something.<p>I've also tended to rely on automatically-generated-and-therefore-always-correct diagrams (e.g. Doxygen, through GraphViz).  This is especially true given that the majority of my documentation, even outside the code, leans toward plain text formats (e.g. man pages, simple text files, reStructuredText, or HTML).

820159,comment,819865,820068,0,0,caffeine,,,"What I did in Rails on a previous app was:<p>- Tie hooks into the logger so I can track exactly which ActiveRecord models are accessed in a given page view.<p>- Have 100% test coverage AND make sure coverage pattern (i.e. frequency distribution of line execution) at least looks something like production AND use subset of production data for testing.<p>When tests are run:<p>- Use the logger hooks to build the <i>tree</i> of partials included in each view, and models included in each view/partial (i.e. we got a User which had Friends and an Avatar which had a PicResource .. etc.),  where the models are linked by foreign key relations, and pages/partials linked by inclusion.  This is why you need 100% coverage & real data - you don't want to miss anything.<p>Then:<p>- Tie cache-busting code to ActiveRecord's after-save hook.  When a table is updated, you go to every tree in which that model appears and go up until you hit the highest partial.  You bust the partial and then you bust the top-level page.<p>- If you want to tune this further (for expensive pages), you can differentiate between CREATE and UPDATE.  On CREATE you need to bust the whole cache for those partials/pages.  On UPDATE you only need to bust existing cached renders of those pages.  So you can just store the N most-viewed pages/partials with those models, and keep their IDs around.<p>Why we did this:<p>I realize this isn't typical for a web app.  Our app had to render binaries for embedded devices, so we had to compile everything into a single file before it went out the door.  This was a highly interactive app, so pages changed all the time.  Using this system, we could:<p>a) maintain quick response times by almost never rendering on page view (rendering was compute-intensive and required about 500ms per page)<p>b) pre-render often-used and often-changed pages<p>c) save our precious database from wear and tear<p>d) do all this WITHOUT harassing the page/content developers, who could throw together new rails views/controllers using whatever AR models they please, without having to maintain onerous ""cache-busting"" lists or strict model-controller ties.<p>(I've omitted some details here, like dealing with cyclical dependencies .. no fun otherwise :)",1252854902

However, the exchange of ideas that results can be meaningful.  This is especially true of emacs, since there's so much room to use it creatively, but is applicable to all those other editors as well.",1189637734

54045,comment,54008,54008,0,0,mhartl,,,"This is basically the ""you throw like a girl"" phenomenon.  With a sister who played NCAA Division I varsity softball, I can assure you that girls can learn to ""throw like a boy"", and then some.  And yet, many more girls than boys ""throw like a girl"" (hence the stereotype).  The reason is simple: throwing well takes practice, and boys throw more than girls. <p>But <i>why</i> do boys throw more?  Boys and girls have different preferences, and many of these preferences have biological as well as cultural roots.  (Indeed, are there any cultures where athletic prowess is more valued in women than in men?)  And so we're right back on the African savannah, where men who liked to throw learned to throw well, and thus killed more game.  <p>It seems that, even with a ""cultural"" explanation, you can't escape nature.",1189635990

Simply select what you want and go watch it in comfy seats with food served to your seats. Whilst your watching the 15 mins of trailers any other people can choose to also come watch the film. Then on the way out pick up a copy of the DVD..",1189635946

54039,comment,53965,53965,0,0,bharath,,,"I suspect that an economic downturn if it does come will be good news for online advertising. Why? Only because there is nothing quite like a downturn to accelerate efficiency. Last time round, the recession was great news for Indian IT companies -- simply because it became efficient for American companies to outsource certain things that they do. Though I dont have figures to back it up, there are quite a few articles out there that point out that the following 2 ratios are not the same (which by implication points to an inefficiency in the allocation of advertising dollars):<p>Time spent by people online:Time spent by people on old school media\nDollars spent on online advertising:Dollars spent on advertising in old school media<p>The 1st ratio is of course larger than the second.",1189635069

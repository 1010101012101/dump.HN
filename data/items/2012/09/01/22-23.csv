What we, I anyway, want is for the CS ""population"" to reflect the population of people who are naturally good at and enjoy CS. This may not have the same gender ratio as the population at large, but I'm pretty sure we're not there now either. And that means some people are not doing what they they're best at, what they were meant to do, which is bad for both them and society.<p>Now as a tactical concern on the road there, there are definitely some men in the system who will not react well to there being more women. Trying to change them with reason will have limited effectiveness. I think what we need to do is put enough highly competent women in front of them that they either have to shut up or look like idiots, thus marginalizing them and their bad attitudes. This will make it easier to get to the natural, aptitude-based proportion of people in the field. This is, IMO, a good reason to encourage well-suited women to go into the field.

4465399,comment,4463526,4465012,2,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Sad fact - fascism and virtually every other ideology of 30's incorporated racism. Racism was just an easy way to garner support. It's also a sideshow to the intellectual basis for fascism, which is collectivism and authoritarianism. (The name is derived from the word ""fasces"", which is Italian for a bundle of sticks.)<p>That said, fascism isn't all that accurately classified as left wing either. While modern left wingers do embrace the collectivism that fascism is based on, fascism doesn't care much about ""social justice"", ""inequality"", or any of the other big left wing buzzwords.<p>Similarly, fascism cares very little about various other right wing values, e.g. traditional protestant values or whatever. They are a convenient way to convince particular corporates to join your syndicate (making it stronger), but that's all.<p>This is why I characterize it as ""center left"" - it doesn't fit easily with any mainstream ideology, but collectivism does point more left than right.<p>Racism is also irrelevant when attempting to determine where fascism lives.

We seek to empower everyone in the world who wants to be a leader to build their community, whether they're a film-maker, a blogger, a grandma, a political dissident, a small business owner, or all of the above.<p>To do this, we have assembled a world-class team of Ruby on Rails hackers. Everyone is a full-stack developer and committed to the highest possible standards of excellence. Unlike everyone else in this space, we are fundamentally a tech company - not a consultancy, a think-tank, or the tech wing of a political party.<p>We practice continuous deployment. Committed code can be pushed to production in less than 5 minutes - and that INCLUDES running the full test suite on our CI platform.<p>We practice promiscuous pairing. You will be working directly with great people who know the product inside and out.<p>You will be using the latest Retina Macbook Pro or Macbook Air, working in one of the coolest spaces in Downtown LA with access to the best restaurants, arts, culture and weather in the US. The cost of living is low and the lifestyle is great. There is an epic 2-level restaurant/bar on our roof.<p>We have a real product with thousands of customers, yet our tech team is just 11 people. Anyone who joins today will have a massive influence on the product and market.<p>Our recent Series A was led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sean Parker, and angel investors include Chris Hughes. Sean Parker and Ben Horowitz are on our board, and our co-founders Jim Gilliam and Jesse Haff built Brave New Films and took on the Iraq War and Walmart while creating an entirely new model of film financing and distribution.<p>If all this sounds interesting, get in touch.

4465308,comment,4462553,4463281,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Yep, that's the point. Now, I'm just a nobody and that's a bit of a joke but if that project were to take off (which is a very relative thing to judge but I'll know it when I see it) then I'll absolutely take that down and actually try to legitimately get featured in those places (except the app store because I will have an app there so it'll be true).<p>It's one thing for a nobody like me to do that but for a somewhat well known and popular service to blatantly lie without even giving a hint to the deceit is pretty low rent. I've got 13 people signed up to test a beta, 50 users from the original version which was a quick weekend project but if I saw those numbers grow at a rate that told me my project could attract a few hundred to a few thousand users I'd take those logos down so fast your head would spin.<p>ButI got the idea from others who have done the same thing with the heading saying something like ""Soon to be featured on"". Anyway, my whole point is that at a certain point it's not even okay to do that sort of thing jokingly and to fabricate a quote when you've got backing and so much visibility is dangerous because eventually someone will catch you like the OP did here.",1346537340
4465307,comment,4463875,4463875,24,0,karpathy,,,"I've experienced something similar from the other point of view. I was one of the 15 guys in class and sat next to the only girl in the class. I remember the teacher giving us exercises and I would type up the code in few minutes, while she would struggle for half hour. She kept telling me how much smarter I was and how she didn't get it, and I would help her through it.<p>What she never realized was that I've already implemented a 90% similar code twice in the last month in my spare time. Or that after she got off the school to hang out with her friends, I went to the library to do some reading, or write the next module of the awesome game I was developing.<p>What I'm trying to say is that in my experience the smarter ones is a lazy way of saying ""the ones that had more interest and spent much more time on it already than you did"". And of course, the argument isn't unique to girls and applies just as well to other guy friends. But in the end, in my experience it has always traced back to raw interest in the topic. So I've always said that girls are not different in any mystical raw Mathematical intelligence way, it's just that for some reason they tend to have less interest in these topics, on average. And why is that? Upbringing and early biases is my best guess - The mother who pulls away the rocket ship from a girls hands and puts in a Barbie is at fault. (But realistically, it is probably only one of the factors.) Worst of all, there is a positive feedback loop involved  where if someone thinks they are not good at something, they will only become less and less interested.",1346537312

4465301,comment,4464057,4464944,1,0,dalke,,,"Right. You say ""We have laws against 'copyright infringement', a wonky idea that essentially nobody understands or cares about, but not against plagiarism, which is what most people actually are against and will work to combat.""<p>Plagiarism does not have a legal definition. It is based on moral/ethical principles which are specific to a field of endeavor. For example, academia has very strict rules against plagiarism while in artistic fields ... well, to quote Picasso, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" People are against plagiarism in the same way that they are against bad art, excessive noise, and foul manners - because by definition plagiarism is something people are against.<p>""So that's what the law should prohibit, now isn't it?"" My point isn't tossed away so lightly. Current copyright law says that my scenario is illegal. Let's suppose then that we change the law. Can you tell me in a non-wonky way what that new law might be?<p>Under this moral law, can I take the text of Harry Potter, replace ""Harry"" with ""Henry"", and redistribute the modified text? (Crediting Rowling, of course). Why or why not? Can I translate Harry Potter into another language? What about fan-subs? Make my own MST3K-like version of the movie? Replace Potter's head with my own? Project the movie onto my garage for my neighbors to watch? And charge them money for it? There are people who would say ""yes"" to all of those. And people who would say ""no."" What is your guiding principle?<p>How would it affect the decision in Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.? Do you consider Dastar guilty of some sort of moral right which is punishable under the law? If so, then what is your view on Scalia, writing for the 8-0 Court: ""A video of the MGM film Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the musical was based), and to Prosper Mrime (who wrote the novel on which the opera was based). In many cases, figuring out who is in the line of origin would be no simple task."" When does one give up figuring out the line of origin?<p>I think anything you come up with will be as wonky as copyright law.<p>Do you realize that the GNU GPL is based on strong copyright law, and that removing it means the free software movement, who can enforces freedom through the GPL, would be almost powerless under your proposal? Does that affect your thoughts?",1346537212

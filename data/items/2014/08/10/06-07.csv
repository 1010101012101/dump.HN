I complained that I wanted to study the fundamental laws of physics, not how they were tested.  They university advisor replied that in order to understand how the world works, first we have to know what it looks like.<p>This is basically my view on this matter.  We can only take for granted the existence of the objective universe.  Everything else must be derived from experiment, including concepts that seem fundamental like time or causality.<p>One interesting thing about causality is that the fact that the macroscopic world obeys cause-and-effect laws is usually attributed to the second law of thermodynamics.  But where does the second law of thermodynamics come from?  I&#x27;ve heard it stated (can&#x27;t say if this is universally held by physicists) that the second law of thermodynamics holds because the initial state of the universe had very low entropy, while the final state of the universe will have very high entropy.  That is the second law of thermodynamics is &quot;caused&quot; by both the initial <i>and</i> final states of the universe.  So causality and time are something that we don&#x27;t fully understand yet.",1407653194

In other words, the very definition of time is intertwined with the relationship between causes and effects.  And Physics does not yet claim to have understood what time means (AFAIK):  It is really real?  Is it something just within our heads? ...<p>If you do not treat causation as a fundamental notion, do you treat time as one?  If yes, how do you explain the dependence between the two.  If not, well, that becomes a subject of even more basic discussion since then I would ask what do you treat to be fundamental notions.  :-)  (There does not seem to be a way for us to get around fundamental notions completely.)",1407650967

8159004,comment,8158832,8158832,21,0,jandrewrogers,,,"This is a pretty limited view of distributed systems engineering, particularly at the high-end. Some topics that are essential for designing efficient, massively distributed systems:<p>- Greedy routing theory i.e. protocol design that is robust in a Nash equilibria sense. It still amazes me how many distributed systems are built on protocol designs that are provably unstable and inefficient.<p>- Space decomposition data structures. The only class of data structure that is efficiently distributable at massive scales due to their mathematical relationship to space-filling curves. Hash tables are often inadvertently implemented as space decomposition structures but there is a much richer and more expressive universe of data structures that exist.<p>- Game theoretic schedule awareness. This is a concept sometimes used in massively parallel systems for HPC but distributed systems designers seem to be unaware of it. It allows extremely high throughput by eliminating much of the need for distributed coordination with respect to accessing shared resources because every process can dynamically schedule its operations based on its modeling of the decisions of other schedulers it interacts with such that it almost never conflicts. I&#x27;ve never seen a paper on it but people have designed systems based on it (hell, I&#x27;ve designed a number of massively parallel systems based on it).<p>- Practical topology. On the surface it is about understanding how to maximize the throughput of a fabric of switch fabrics and most messaging patterns used in distributed systems today are naive at an elementary level; HPC has a much better understanding of packet flow optimization. There is also the more theoretical algebraic topology that hints how you efficiently do computational operations over space decomposition structures (mentioned above) with minimal data motion. Algebraic topology is enormously relevant to massively distributed and parallel databases but I rarely meet people who understand it outside of Oracle and similar (not that most of them are using it well).<p>A lot of distributed systems were engineered without any awareness of these things. Most of their fundamental weaknesses follow from that. The kinds of distributed systems that you can design if you really know the above topics greatly exceed the capabilities of popular distributed systems used today.<p>To reduce it to a simple metric: if you can show me a competitive algorithm design for the Graph500 benchmark, you actually understand massively scalable distributed systems. The efficiency at scale demonstrated in that benchmark is so far beyond common distributed systems because the designers of the top entries actually understand the above points I raised.",1407650899

From dealing with bad, aggressive drivers who will get you and themselves killed, to rapidly changing road and weather conditions, to widely disparate entrances and loading docks, inaccurate GPS, etc. it just seems like the times that the self-driving would benefit are so infrequent with regular cross-country driving and delivery. This seems so different than a self-driving car that mostly is going to take you to and from work and the grocery store, etc.<p>There is also the liability issue, I mentioned that things are rigged to dump the hassles on the drivers and this is one of them. You&#x27;re economically pressured to falsify log data, so when you nod off and accidentally kill some people, your employer is off the hook. A nice working self-driving truck would reduce fatalities caused by gross driver error, but I guess it would put the trucking company back on the hook in the cases where a catastrophe did happen. In the short term self-driving vehicles might be undesirable to some companies because it might eliminate their ability to shove negative externalities onto a third party (the drivers.)<p>self-driving commercial trucks will happen, I just think 5-8 years is not likely.",1407650793

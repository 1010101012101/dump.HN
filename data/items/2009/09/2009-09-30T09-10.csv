They had an enormous database (half a terabyte or so) due to their decision to store cached content in database tables.  Their backup strategy was to try to sync their live DB files to another machine over firewire.  When the master database eventually got corrupted, they dutifully rsynced the corrupt files over to the ""backup"".<p>Once the database finally rolled over and died, they claimed to be unable to recover any user data at all from the hard drives.  But it seems they never bothered to go to a  vendor specializing in MySQL recovery.  Offers of help from Percona went unanswered, at least in public.<p>Full disclosure - I run a competing site (pinboard.in).  Magnolia's stunning negligence in securing user data, and Larry Halff's attempts to cast himself as a victim of internet trolls when confronted by his angry users, are pretty much what motivated me to start the project.",1254304380

I don't think I can go into specifics, having been one of the original programmers on clicker.com, but going more towards the decision of allowing the users to decide, and not telling the users what they want, is a very good strategy.  there is nothing wrong with changing directions based on what your users want.",1254302908

Your legal representation can explain the significance of these to you.  Without them it is impossible for me to conclusively evaluate whether ma.gnolia could possibly infringe on your registered trademark.<p>As a matter of US law, your trademark is likely not to the word ""Magnolia"" in all senses, but probably scoped to its use in CMS software.  As ma.gnolia does not sell CMS software, there is no possibility of market confusion with regards to the purchase of CMS software.  We both have presences on the Internet, but frankly, trademark law is not a guarantee that you will be the only mention of the word Magnolia on the Internet.<p>You claim that ""[ma.gnolia's] graphic appearance can be totally related to our CD"".  It is unclear to me that you are making a claim here based in trademark law.  If you are, I would need a copy of your registered specimen to compare it to our logo to determine whether the claim is valid.  That being said, a cursory inspection of the logo present on your website shows the word Magnolia.  A cursory inspection of our logo shows the word Ma.gnolia with a giant flower on it.  Your claim that these are confusingly similar is baseless as a matter of law.<p>Your lawyers are welcome to contact my lawyers if they have any other questions.<p>Cordially yours,",1254302655

852123,comment,851971,852100,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Im confused; dont you think he has a right to feel cross Microsoft screwed him (if that is what happened)?<p>The rest of what your saying is irrelevant (I agree: patents used in a broad way are evil) because it appears he has a specific complaint against a specific company :) not a general attempt to enforce his/a patent?<p>I get the impression you haven't read the background? It does appear MS might well have done an injustice by him in '93. If that is what he is trying to right; then I guess I support him. If he is, as you suggesting, just trying to sue his patent all over the place (which I see no evidence for yet) then I am with you totally.<p>I worry that the patent trolling leaves cases like this, where there seems the makings of a reasonable complaint, out high and dry :(",1254302226

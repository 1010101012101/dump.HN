The mnemonic I learned 40 years ago is shockingly racist, violent, and sexist--and so impossible to forget. The mnemonics taught to kids nowadays are boring and easy to forget.<p>Ha ha ha<p>I just memorized the sequence as a &#x27;word&#x27;. Like the beginning of each word, so would be like BlaBroReOraYelGreBluViGraBla
(but not in English, so it&#x27;s shorter, since I take only the first letter of some of the colors, so maybe BlBROYGBlVGBk)<p>I didn&#x27;t use a phrase because I made this mnemonic myself.<p>Another electronics mnemonic I came up with, which is the Cathode and which is the Anode of a diode. So if you see it&#x27;s something like this: --->|--- the left side is the Anode (since it looks like an A) and the right is the Cathode so it looks like a K (mirrored in this case)",1433059100

A few points.<p>The time tested old school way to avoid this problem is to limit openness and impose internal structure. The long lasting subcultures of old, namely the ancient mystery schools and the fraternal orders that flourished from the Renaissance until roughly the post-WWII era, were initiatory orders with oaths, degrees, and governing bodies. Sometimes they were secret as well, or at least secretive. Most historians seem to say that this was to avoid political persecution, and that&#x27;s undoubtedly true, but it was also perhaps a way to avoid the dumbing down and dissipation described here.<p>I&#x27;d adjust the author&#x27;s dates. It&#x27;s not 1975 until 2000. It&#x27;s more accurately roughly 1950 until 2000. The subculture was the engine of cultural creation in the postwar era. It gave us rock, psychedelia, hippies, punks, disco, hip hop, hacker culture, goths, and ravers, and all the immense cultural, musical, technical, and artistic expressions that went with.<p>My personal sense is that rave was the last postwar subculture. I was there and watched it go through precisely what this author describes. There does not seem to have been another.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just a loss of faith. I personally blame the Internet a bit, especially social media. It&#x27;s no longer possible for a subculture to stay underground long enough to build up any energy. The entire life cycle now occurs before the first song is over.<p>Who knows... Maybe we need another occult revival.

9633376,comment,9630335,9630978,0,0,Gibbon1,,,"I think seriously the intrinsic thing is that the language itself doesn&#x27;t marshal (right word, not sure) anything that&#x27;s particularly fat. The classic is if allocating memory require dealing with a general purpose garbage collector. If that&#x27;s the case you&#x27;re pretty much dead as far as systems stuff goes because now you can&#x27;t predict how long anything will take to run.<p>And the minimal libraries usually need to be light weight as well. Or at least such that you can strip out what&#x27;s not wanted. Here again garbage collection becomes an issue. If the language supports it natively then it&#x27;s going to be impossible in practice to prevent the libraries from using it for something unexpected.<p>The last bit is escape. There are always some cases where the language doesn&#x27;t have the ability to implement a critical bit of stuff and you need a way to seamlessly mess with that something. In simple you need to be able to insert a bit of arbitrary code and have it work properly.",1433057490

I absolutely agree support should be charged for on a case/time based basis, but limiting updates essentially means the site will be broken after the license term. WP moves fast enough that keeping up with core/plugin/etc revisions on at least a quarterly basis is necessary if you don&#x27;t want your site to be broken or hacked.<p>I think the minimum for at least security/compatibility/bug fixes should be 2-3 years. The products we sell have a 3-year warranty for all defects, yet your proposed software business model wont do that.<p>Last point: you want $90-1000/year to upload databases to S3? Isnt this a trivial amount of developer effort to automate? I am not a developer by any means, and I could do this fairly quickly. Numerous high quality plugins will do backups for free and writing a cron job to upload these to S3 would take a few minutes.

That was a long time ago.<p>The big problem in the early days was getting a compiler. DoD had a test suite for the compiler, and only compilers that passed could use the Ada name. They also had a &quot;floor equals ceiling&quot; rule - no missing features, no extra features. Compilers were to be feature-compatible.<p>That&#x27;s how aerospace does things.  The interface spec defines the interface.  If something is incompatible with the interface, it&#x27;s defective. It&#x27;s why you can take Pratt and Whitney engines off a 767 and put on GE or Rolls Royce engines.  DoD took the position that a compiler was a part with a specification.<p>Ada was a big language back then, and some of the compiler companies underestimated the job. Ada compilers were quite expensive - one for the M68000 was $40,000.  I ordered that one when I was with a big aerospace company.  When it showed up as a magnetic tape, it came with an unexpected cover letter, saying that this wasn&#x27;t a validated compiler, and the validated compiler would follow - someday.  No go.  Quality control reject.  Red tag attached: &quot;REJECTED BY INCOMING INSPECTION - DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO SPECIFICATION&quot;. Purchase order says &quot;validated compiler&quot;. Tape returned to vendor. Vendor tries to get out of giving refund. Legal department hammers vendor until they pay up.  Meanwhile, another vendor ships a validated compiler, and that is ordered and used. That&#x27;s how aerospace used to do things.<p>The compiler price was a big problem for non-Government customers.  That contributed to the lack of adoption. We had great hopes for Ada, having used Modula successfully.  But it was not to be.",1433056291

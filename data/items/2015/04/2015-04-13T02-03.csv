9365747,comment,9364342,9364342,0,0,Animats,,,"I used to keep a horse at the horse barn on the Stanford campus, and I&#x27;ve met many Palo Alto high-achieving high school kids there.   I asked a group of high school students, mostly from Palo Alto High School, who were discussing grades &quot;What&#x27;s considered a good grade point average now&quot;, and was told, in a bleak voice, &quot;4.5&quot;.<p>Some of them thrive on learning.  They show up back at the barn, years later, after graduating from a big-name college. It&#x27;s tough on the ones who aren&#x27;t quite bright enough for the selective colleges but have parents who expect that level of achievement.  I&#x27;ve seen the pain in some who know they&#x27;re just not bright enough.<p>It&#x27;s getting worse.  Suicides for Paly and Gunn students (those two high schools are the closest to Stanford) have been climbing since about 2009. I knew about the five suicides from Paly, but didn&#x27;t realize it had reached the point that there are now guards watching the railroad tracks behind the school.",1428893875

I tested into the best public magnet school in Philadelphia.<p>The whole thing began to unravel in High School, really... got a &quot;No Credit&quot; for an extra-curricular college course, had to retake a year of Geometry, barely made it through High School Trig. But, I went to college to study Computer Science. And failed out. Failed the same Intro to Pre-Calculus class seven fucking times in three semesters. (Half-semester course.)<p>I took a semester off, and enrolled in a local community college. Changed my major to English. Graduated with a BA in 2008, in the middle of the economic crisis. I didn&#x27;t have any Internships... couldn&#x27;t afford to take one as I was working to pay my way through college part-time in the evenings. Got a shitty telemarketing job for the benefits, got fired, spent a year out of work, worked for the Philadelphia welfare office for a year and a half, and quit.<p>I lucked into a startup job as a Community Manager, but the environment was borderline abusive, and beyond the border unethical (buying lists of email addresses for their target market to add to their mailing list and calling them active users in fundraising presentations). After getting fired/quitting, I found a decent job doing Web Production for a speciality publishing company.<p>I&#x27;m 31, in debt up to my eyeballs with student loans, barely making ends meet, and working a job that offers no challenge and little opportunity for advancement. I have personal projects where I can get some joy, but it&#x27;s hard to find the time to do those when you&#x27;re working forty hours a week, with an hour commute each way, and seeing a huge chunk of your cash go towards paying off the creditors for your borderline useless degree. If I didn&#x27;t have my self-taught HTML and CSS skills, I&#x27;d never be where I am, so that&#x27;s something.<p>I still feel like I should be further along because of all the pushing I was given as a kid. They told me I&#x27;d change the world. Instead, I&#x27;m just some underemployed schlub. I&#x27;m not about to jump in front of a train, but for those kids with more pressure, I can&#x27;t blame &#x27;em.<p>Wow, that got long.<p>(I kept the names of the companies I worked for silent, because I try to keep this account semi-anonymous.

That 16+ years of studying your ass off is an investment someone else made in you, hoping you become a productive member of society that makes life a little bit better for someone else while earning a living for yourself along the way. There are roughly 3 billion people on this planet who are desperate to get any sort of education, let alone the education you were given, for free (before college). I get your complaints, but a 9-5 gig (or even an 8-7 one) would be considered a life of leisure and luxury for most of the world for pretty much all of history. In fact, the only time a life you are wishing you had has been common has been in the last 50 years or so in the developed world. I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re pretty damn lucky. If you want to get ahead, instead of thinking you need to out-compete your rivals, I would instead focus on ways to make someone&#x27;s life significantly better, then figure out how to do it for 10 people, then 1000....see where I&#x27;m going with this?",1428891525

</code></pre>
This is precisely the feeling I had right before I resigned from my position at Amazon. Though I worked at a subsidiary, not Amazon proper, the culture at Amazon everywhere can be absurdly stubborn. In the presence of a bad team, the &quot;leadership principles&quot; can be used for evil, and not for good. Which is why I was consistently told that bugs in software were OK if a majority of customers didn&#x27;t care to call up and complain about it to our poor, overworked customer service teams.<p>Amazon thinks that it already has &quot;the customer,&quot; in its most broad abstraction, already in its grasp, and doesn&#x27;t ever need to fight to keep any of them there. That is why, when I departed my Amazon subsidiary in December of 2014, they were only just starting to hire a UX team. These principles can be made so dogmatic to the point of destructive company culture that outwardly resists change, be it to marketing designs or entire technology infrastructures that entire teams comprising hundreds of people rely upon to get work done.<p>This is why it is very hard to keep talented people in positions of management at Amazon.",1428891468

Power8 has 230GB/s sustained on a 12 core chip while Xeon Haswell-EP has 102GB/s on 12 core.

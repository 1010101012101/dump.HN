I don't consider the federal reserve (a monopolist on money) to be a free-market institution. I don't consider government-guaranteed mortgages to be a free market program. I don't think forcing banks to give loans to people unworthy of credit is how a market should operate.<p>But with all that meddling causing the current crisis, we look for yet more government involvement to solve the problem. I look at history and theory and see that the injection of government involvement throughout the economy doesn't work. Ask the people who tried to hop over the Berlin wall!",1320504942

With that argument, I think publishers could sell a variable fee.<p>Maybe there's a slightly more middle ground--pay based on the number of peak _simultaneous_ borrows in a period. Just as a library would have to pay for each physical copy lent, is it too Luddite to suggest Amazon do something similar? Not pay for each borrow, but based on the peak simultaneous borrows?",1320504923

3199851,comment,3199463,3199653,9,0,WildUtah,,,"Most of the manufacturing jobs are already gone -- even as manufacturing production rises -- and yet just a few years ago in the developed world nearly everyone who wanted to work could find a job.<p>In fact, developed nations in Europe and the Americas are importing vast numbers of low wage workers to do low value per hour jobs where humans are still better than machines. It continues in the face of a prolonged severe recession.<p>So the emerging problem of no available work to do does not seem to be materializing. In fact, it's hard to imagine. Does every public park and private garden in your city look as clean, inviting, and pretty as it could possibly be? Is every street paved smooth without cracks and potholes? Does a bumper crop of fruit never go bad for lack of harvesters?\nIs every home clean and freshly scrubbed all the time and is a freshly cooked meal always waiting? Does every corner have a crossing guard during school hours?<p>There's a lot of intellectually undemanding work to be done in a utopia if we want to pay for it.<p>Right now, we import foreign workers to do cheap labor but we could take unemployed citizens and subsidize their wages to have our own do those jobs instead. The unemployed citizens are living on private or public welfare and social insurance today but they could be working. We could kick in public money to make it possible to pay a legal wage with benefits for the jobs undocumented workers do and the employers would prefer to stay legal by hiring citizens. We could even document the undocumented and add enough subsidies to employ them too.<p>Economic change driving social change is disruptive. But let's remember that technological productivity is a positive change that makes us wealthier.<p>Unemployment that follows from energy shortages or global climate change, if those ever get serious, would be a much bigger worry.",1320504892

If you disagree, try to recite for me how much popcorn costs at your nearest three major theaters right now. Do you check before you decide where to go for a movie?<p>This is well in line with my own pet theory of the free market, which says that people's brains can handle optimizing on one or _maybe_ two things when making a product decision, and anything else is overwhelming. For a theater, that's what movie you want to see, and what price you have to pay. Anything beyond that and you have to start making spreadsheets, and it's not worth it to anybody. So beyond the price and the main desirable quality of the product, producers aren't really forced to compete, because nobody will call them on it.",1320504764

Why is now the time when the majority of the population becomes too dumb to cut it in the ""new economy?"" Especially when technology acts as a multiplying effect for what someone without specialized education can do? Generally, depressed wages (i.e.: decreased price of labor) should drive up demand. If that doesn't happen, that means there is a bottleneck somewhere else.<p>I think a key observation missing in all of these analyses is the most obvious one: that bottleneck is energy. What's different between 1995 and today? Well a barrel of oil cost about $25 2010 dollars back then, and costs almost $100 dollars now. We have an economy that is entirely driven by oil. When the cost of that goes up, because we've run out of the easy-to-reach stuff and have moved to expensive and difficult methods, then it's no surprise that the economic equilibrium shifts to a point with lower activity.",1320504610

If, instead of trying to impose an artificial scarcity on copyable works (which includes inventions), we had a pool of ""awards"" that were distributed to creators proportionally to the value of the works, then of course that would provide incentive to disclose copyable works.  So what if Knuth would get paid for work he would have made available anyway?  There are plenty of people in our economy getting paid to do what they love and would do for free/much less.<p>The main problem with the idea is that it eliminates negotiations between self interested parties as the means for value estimation.  ""Voting"" on the most valuable works is quite simply a terrible idea.  With copyrightable works, we could probably have some technological way (think DRM) of tracking popularity / frequency of use.  But for patents, I'm not sure how it would work.  I suppose that as long as you make it where the total tax levied on an individual to fund this system doesn't depend on how many or which works they used (though it could depend broadly on what they produce, what industry they are in, etc), they won't have an incentive to hide what they used.

This time, it's for a highly successful software engineering company, so I like to think I'm making the right choices.<p>Step one is getting grounded, for me, that was understanding the basics of web development, how web pages work, and how to get them onto the web. Full stack development even with static sites can be very valuable: know how to bootstrap a brand new project, add it to version control, set up a production stack(e.g. Apache/passenger), have a basic workflow set up for yourself, do diverse things and solve stupid problems you're having for yourself. Got freelance clients? Give an invoicing app or client portal a go, it won't hurt for people to see you fix problems and don't dally with newnew technologies for now.<p>Try to stand out, for me, a lot of developers I meet don't grok photoshop and basic UI/UX, so I made it a months long focus to be able to design static mocks and live sites from scratch, and trying to make them as elegant and experience friendly as possible. Knowing HTML and CSS extremely well also has helped, for every programmer I meet who is a DOM wizard with JS, they don't understand modern HTML standards or how to write elegant CSS. I also understand photoshop as well as most graduates from Ringling(I know, I'm marrying one) and took serious time to grow my tool set(like using bash and vim effectively). Make yourself stand out, grok shit engineers aren't interested in or don't have the desire to fully learn(JavaScript is a fair example) you'll be thankful for it come interview time.<p>Finally, be modest. Once you have a professional looking online presence, you've done all you really can to make a good first impression. The rest is all desire to make shit work, to do something you've never, ever done before. Don't act like you can be put in over your head, know that the nights and weekends for many young people in technology are when you catch up to senoir peers.<p>I tend to agree somewhat with the 'get Into the community' observations people have made, but am employer has never asked me 'which meetups do you enjoy?' or 'what kind of open source things have you contributed?' - they honestly largely do not care in my experience, it can help you get a strong recommendation from someone inside the company, but this is unusual so don't lean on it, look at it as a badge or ribbon to accent your developer coat.<p>Which leads me to my last point, my best opportunities so far have come from very strong software engineers who appreciate my attitude, attention, and willingness to ask\nSmart questions while trying to explain what I do understand. They go to bat for me when they have an opening in the company, and that's huge for me. Something insane like 80% of professionals received a recommendation from family or a friend to land their position; in fact just a few weeks ago there was a forrst post from a UK kid who needed a rails job, he had a so-so online presence, but a bunch of people went to bat for him, saying that he showed real competience and that someone should really give him a chance; within the same day as the original post, he was employed( p.s. he had a compsci degree).<p>The market is starving for competent developers, I must get 5-10 hits every month from recruiters for all kinds of positions in San Fran and NY, so there's hundreds of people looking for new talent. Ask yourself why they haven't called you for an interview yet, and take example from the people you admire who are getting those calls.<p>Addendum: Just for the sake of clarity; these tips aren't necessarily the way to get into an entrepreneurial company, or one that's particularly very small.

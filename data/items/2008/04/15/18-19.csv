And there is scalr too,  but it would have been much better if Amazon provided a very robust solution themselves, as they know their systems better than anybody else.<p>Then Google's app engine would really pale in comparison to Amazon's offering.   Right now google is providing an engine that scales up, and which is very easy to get started (their main advantage), but the downside you have to be tied to a very cripled enviroment.<p>If Amazon provided the glue that sticks all their offerings into one comprehensive package that is easy to use that this would be the best of both worlds.\nWho would even use google's app engine where you can have great scalability, easy to use, and have your own linux systems running on Amazon?",1208285931

I've also screwed around on the 'net since Mosaic, and dialed in to local BBSes before that (I started young :-).<p>In my opinion, any form of two-way communication which allows anonymous entry will be vulnerable to spam. I certainly can't think of a workaround for that, and nobody else has managed to yet, either. I agree that Twitter spam has a good chance of being eradicated once they tighten things up a little. However, in part they have that chance because Twitter isn't fully bidirectional -- there's no way that I know of for a Twitter user to send messages to someone who hasn't signed up to follow the user.",1208283931

The follower spam problem described in those links (this too: <a href=""http://www.stoptwitterspam.com/blog/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stoptwitterspam.com/blog/about/</a>) is indeed spam but could be could be fixed without it breaking the essence of the twitter approach.<p>I'm convinced that spam is a result of weaknesses in the model of the email system and not inevitable as you suggest. If we had our time again we would be able to standardise on a better model and for this reason was a bit surprised that you just accepted spam as part of life.<p>The blog link at the top describes some of my thoughts.

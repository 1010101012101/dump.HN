467295,comment,467146,467157,0,0,smoody,,,"Here's a Mac example. Sometimes I keep an iCal alarm alert dialog box open for long periods of time -- I know, not a great habit, but when I'm focused on programming, I just kind of push it off to the side. At a regular interval (every 10 minutes perhaps? just a guess), it steals the focus and moves to the top of the window stack. If the purpose is to re-remind me of an overdue alarm, shaking the dialog box or playing a sound would be better because I can mentally make note of it and keep working vs. having to re-click in my editor, for example, and retype whichever keystrokes disappeared into the iCal alarm abyss.",1233817192

On one side, we have the product guy, on the other, we've got the consulting guy.<p>You've got Joel, Jeff, Paul Bucheit on the product side saying that ""Yes, automated testing and some of the OOP principles are great, but let's not go as far as Uncle Bob""<p>Check out the SOLID principles. Some of the principles are alright, but when Uncle Bob explained that Rectangle class thing, I don't know what to say other than I just changed my mind leaning toward not to buy his ""Clean Code"" book.<p>On the other side, you've got Kent Beck, GoF, Uncle Bob, Martin Fowler, etc. (and possibly Gilles Bowkett). They're what you would consider ""war-proven"": they've done numerous ""IT projects"", leading a team of corporate developers, probably making a website for clients, and etc.<p>I don't mean to be rude (and perhaps this is an overgeneralisation), but I haven't heard any software product made by the consulting group. Yes, they wrote code, but the code is based on requirements given by some clients that:<p>1) Change the requirements frequently\n2) Keep cutting costs\n3) Ask for more\n4) Cut more time<p>There's a huge different between writing code for commercial software that you steer versus writing code driven by someone else who knows almost nothing about software development but knows a lot how to save money.<p>Would you TDD-ed your UI code?<p>If you wrote API, yes, I can understand you do heavy unit-tests.<p>A side note for having your own unit-test framework:\n1) Developers shouldn't write them\n2) Developers should provide minimal to enough unit-tests\n3) Go hire your own test team to do the rest<p>Developers aren't meant to be full-time testers. Testers aren't mean to be a full-time developers.<p>What I'd like to see is a team like this:\n1) Joel becomes the product manager\n2) Paul Bucheit becomes the software architect\n3) Jeff, Kent Beck and Martin Fowler do the coding\n4) Robert Martin and those infested TDD people can build a full-blown suite of unit-test frameworks, acceptance test and etc.<p>Microsoft has a category for the people in (4), it is ""SDET"". For those of you who think developers must write a comprehensive TDD (not just a minimum or ""just to pass""), here's a challenge to you: why don't you try and be SDET. You'll see some of the serious full-blown test code, black-box, UI test code, UI automation and a serious CI process. I'm sure the experience will make your TDD and unit-test code look pale in comparison.<p>Google seems going to that (MS) direction slowly.",1233816906

Let a new comment by an orange user rise for the first hour or so, and then drop it back down to where it would be if it was posted by a normal gray user.",1233815225
467216,comment,466592,466592,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"<i>A few random thoughts about Ruby's traditional unordered Hash:</i><p>The Hash#keys method should have returned a Set, not an Array. That way no one would have been baffled by the lack of predictable order. But, unfortunately, Set is not a built-in class. Hence, Hash#keys has to return an Array.<p>Since Rails came out, there's been, I think, an ever increasing use of Symbols as Hash keys. If you want to examine your Hash in a specific order--perhaps in a test--it's tempting to sort the Array of keys. But there's no Symbol#<=> method. Therefore, an Array of Symbols cannot be sorted (without monkey patching).<p>If, for whatever reason, you create a Hash whose keys are of various types, the keys are probably not sortable. Hence, there's no way to examine its contents in a predictable order.<p><i>A few thoughts about the new ordered Hash:</i><p>Personally, I see no need for the <i>built-in</i> Hash to be ordered. I'm so accustomed to thinking of hashes as unordered. And, because I don't have Ruby 1.9, I don't use the newfangled hashy syntax for passing parameters.<p>But one of the commenters (Radarek) points out something about parameter passing. He/she says, ""It's another big + for ordered hashes because they are used as replacement for named parameters [in Ruby 1.9]."" He/she mentions a project in which a method must process its keyword parameters in the order they were given.<p>The thought of trying to process keyword parameters in the order given is very jarring to my old-fashioned Ruby brain, and to my Python brain. Yet, evidently, someone out there wants to do this without telling the client to pass an Array of Arrays.<p>So I wonder what the major use case is for the predictable ordering of the <i>built-in</i> Hash. Perhaps it's for ease of examining and comparing Hashes in tests? Perhaps it's for processing keyword parameters in a specific order when they're passed using spiffy syntax? What?",1233815219

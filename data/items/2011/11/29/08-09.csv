As soon as I realized that if I buy anything that isn't a Kindle means I can't access all the books I've already bought from Amazon, I knew I'd have to buy a Kindle. This is a bad situation for a consumer, since I'm locked in to a specific platform. Right now it's fine for me, since the Kindle also happens to be the cheapest offering.

Here are the key points, quoted from the paper:<p>* ""What Cohn and Umans realized is that under certain conditions, matrix multiplication, too, can be embedded into the group algebra of a finite\ngroup G, although the embedding is more complex and the group must be non-abelian to yield a nontrivial bound.""<p>The conditions that must be satisfied are as follows:<p>* ""...the group has three subgroups, H_1, H_2, H_3, with the property that whenever h_1  H_1, h_2  H_2, and h_3  H_3 with h_1 h_2 h_3 = 1, then h_1 = h_2 = h_3 = 1"" (AKA the ""triple-product property,"") and<p>* ""|H1||H2||H3| > d_i^3,"" where the d_i's are the dimensions of the square submatrices into which we decompose the original matrix.  (AKA ""beating the sum of cubes."")<p>The groups that have been found to have these properties are ""wreath products of abelian groups with the symmetric group S_n.""",1322555756

However, sometimes you may want to watch MP4 videos or movies at home in a more easeful way, for example, to play it on your home DVD player. On this occasion, you need to burn MP4 to DVD. In fact, converting MP4 to DVD is very easy if you choose the right DVD burning software. For Mac users, here we highly recommend you use Aimersoft DVD Creator for Mac, a professional DVD converter to help you directly burn MP4 video and movies to DVD for playback on any home DVD players on Mac (Snow Leopard, Lion included).

3289609,comment,3285742,3285742,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"""Statistical significance"" is starting to tire me.  It is too binary for my test: either a given result ""achieved"" statistical significant, or it is not.  Obviously you have to choose a threshold, and which it should be is much less obvious.<p>Couldn't we just do a way with statistical significance, and just publish likelihood ratios, or decibels of evidence (in favour of one hypothesis over another)?  That way, we should know <i>exactly</i> how much an experiment is supposed to be worth.  No arbitrary threshold.  Plus, you get to combine several experiments, and get the compound evidence, which can be much stronger (or <i>weaker</i>) than the evidence you get from any single one of them.  And <i>then</i> you may have found something worthwhile.<p>This is especially crucial when said evidence is expensive. In teaching, for instance, one researcher can hardly do experiments on more than 2 or three classrooms, over little more than a year.  This is often not enough to accumulate enough evidence <i>at once</i> for reaching statistical significance.  But <i>a bunch of</i> such experiments may very well be.

Sure, most startup minded are likely single and focused on business, but non work considerations are important to many people. Under current immigration law, family members of green card holders and naturalized US citizens get preference in visa allocations; whatever you think of this as policy, it's certainly a significant benefit for some people in the country of origin which wouldn't be available with the sea borne approach. Likewise potential business or investment partners in a non-US country would probably prefer to deal with someone who has a secure foothold in the US capital or retail market.

3289589,comment,3289261,3289493,1,0,po,,,"Django also calls the functions/classes where you define the logic of selecting the models to operate on, validate, pick output, etc a 'view'. The template where you map the data to html is just that: a template. People coming to Django from Rails often get confused by that. In the end, it's very similar but with a different name.<p>I'm reminded of the old Microsoft Foundation Classes with their Document-Object model that lacked a controller. Their promise was that you could reuse views and documents but in practice the lack of a controller to handle user input meant you never could. At least, I never could.",1322554669

3289583,comment,3288671,3289503,2,0,kamaal,,,"For all those people who are not getting it. Today success of most software shops is about business innovation not technology innovation. Yes there are instances of Google and other big web giants innovating greatly in the technology area. But they amount to less than 1% of the software crowd.<p>We are all writing software to solve business problems. We are not writing software for Software innovation.<p>Unless you are doing something special. Most software today is written in IDE's. You don't have to remember syntax at all these days. The IDE will do it for you. It knows what libraries you want, it knows how many exceptions your code can run into. It knows how to compile, build and package your code. I can give you your code coverage. It can even do documentation for you. There is hardly anything IDE's can't do these days.<p>All you need is a little semantic awareness. And there are solutions to nearly every problem you are likely to run into a software shop. There are libraries, API's and frameworks that have understood and defined your problems as a generic case and solved them. There are forums to help you out on edge cases.<p>All you do these days is know a solution to a generic pattern of problems. You fundamentally pull out those logical solutions from your brain and parameterize them for the solution need at hand. And remaining is simply IDE play.<p>Very little or really a non quantifiable of highly intellectual work is happening in business based software shops today. Google, Facebook are exceptions, not the normal.<p>And this isn't surprising. We need armies of programmers to do all the bulk of the business job out there. If you are still thinking that as a software guy you are going to work with math theorems, then you have got it wrong.<p>Given all these, my success depends on only two things. How much aware of the reusable solutions. How quickly and how many problems can I solve using them. Which is productivity.<p>This is drag and drop programming demystified.",1322554516

3289576,comment,3289261,3289452,4,0,bad_user,,,"I agree with you - checking if a user is logged in, authorization, validating the request, choosing the right view to handle the response (html, json, csv, redirection if you just did a POST and so on), these all belong in a controller action. The framework <i>can be</i> smart about it, relying on conventions and all that, but if there's one thing I've learned is that the rules are meant to be broken and I never met a project that fit perfectly in the sweat-spot of any framework (which is why I do not think middleware cuts it for specific scenarios).<p>To me the rules are pretty clear:<p><pre><code>   * data-processing stuff belongs in models\n   * business-logic belongs in *business models*, \n     if said logic is related to the UI (i.e. repeat-password),\n     although for simplicity you can choose not to bother\n   * request processing (authorization, choosing the models, \n     choosing the view) belongs in a controller action\n   * response processing belongs in a view\n</code></pre>\nRegarding view forwarding, I once had a request that based on a parameter, instead of rendering HTML it would forward to a view that sent an email to the user with a CSV file attached, then redirected to a notification message. But only if the user was properly authorized. So the controller's logic was getting reused, forwarding to multiple views depending on expected output. Now that's a real controller and a real view.",1322554360

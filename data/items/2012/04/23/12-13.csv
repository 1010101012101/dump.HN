It's disturbing though, that the first improvement touted is the removal of ads.  For a free service offered by an an advertising company, the GMail ads are about as unobtrusive as they could be.  And hiding the ads doesn't do anything for privacy concerns.  If it's ad-free email you're after, you really should be looking to pay for the service from someplace else.",1335185930

We're not talking about the government, here.</i><p>Yeah, but in this country, it's corporate (not governmental) malevolence that is the problem.<p><i>Any company should be wary about hiring someone who has a history of airing their dirty laundry in public.</i><p>Attitudes like yours, while not uncommon, are the reason companies are able to pull so much unethical shit. People are afraid to speak up because they're worried about what will happen to them in the future.<p>If companies don't want to be disparaged by ex-employees, they should treat them well. And if things get to a point where someone decent still needs to be fired, they should write a severance contract. If you fire good employees without severance, you deserve to have your name dragged through the mud. If you're completely cash-strapped and can't afford a severance check, at least have the decency to (a) write a good reference, and (b) not contest the person's unemployment.<p><i>The truth is that if you want to, you can create change, even in large companies like Microsoft, and even without being in a management position. Most people are simply too impatient and not willing to do the work.</i><p>Ha! Not so. Important change steps on the toes of people who are entrenched and powerful. Always. Sure, you can clean up a few desks, but <i>real</i> change is just hard to push through.<p><i>It takes time to build influence and figure out what has to be said in public vs in private.</i><p>Right or wrong, many people find white-collar social climbing to be disgusting and slimy. One could argue that this attitude reflects defensive dismissal or ""sour grapes"" (i.e. because people aren't good at it, they decry it as an immoral mode of combat) but I think there is some valor in that attitude, nonetheless. Ideally, decisions should be made based on whether they are right or wrong, not based on political extrinsics.<p><i>When I've decided to move on, I've always made sure to send my manager an email describing what I think the company was doing right, what it was doing wrong, and what made me decide it was time to leave.</i><p>I've never seen that have any kind of effect.

No. That's not it.<p>When you factor in morale damage and the amount of managerial time spent on them, it's more expensive to run a PIP than to let someone go with a severance package.<p>PIPs are paper shields in a lawsuit, and do nothing about disparagement, which severance contracts usually cover. A PIP doesn't actually establish that the employee was an objective underperformer, only that he ""should have seen it coming"".<p>The real purpose of the PIP is two-fold. First, it's to make the employee feel like he <i>deserves</i> to be fired or that he has no recourse, even though that's not true. Second, it's to make the HR and finance offices look good because they ""saved money"" on severance packages, when what they actually did was externalized the costs to that employee's team.<p>PIPs make no sense. When companies fire people, it's typical to close out that person's computer access and take him out of the building immediately, as if it's a danger to have him in the building for another minute. Yet companies have no qualms about keeping an essentially fired employee in the office for <i>a month</i> on a PIP.",1335183848

You can't beat all of them, and chances are that you can't even beat <i>one</i> of them.<p>The problem with OP's letter to the upper management is that he thinks they actually give a rat's ass about ""the company"", rather than their own careers. He actually believes that company-man drivel and that these people care enough about the firm to stand up for a ""rebel"" who is good for it. Not so. They won't.<p>One explanation of large-company idiocy is <i>corporate consistency</i>. People would rather be consistently wrong than admit past error and be inconsistent. It's the same with companies. The companies has already made the decision (right or wrong) that the manager outranks the employee. Asking a higher-up to do something about a shitty manager is asking him to override the corporate consistency, which people seldom do-- <i>especially</i> the sorts of people (ethically flexible, lacking creativity, politically minded) who get into upper management in the first place.",1335183071

If you're smart, competent and hard-working, in the world we live in, you can be well off and deserve to be. Being broke is not a badge of honour. Making money is not a badge of shame - nor is it an incidental event that just happens while you weren't looking.<p>What you're implying (though you're not saying it directly, so I could be misunderstanding you) with both of your stories is the exact opposite of what I believe. In the first story, you're putting up a straw man of the money-obsessed fool and warding people off the pursuit of money with that. In the second, you're implying that making money is incidental to other pursuits.<p>The reality, which I'm advocating for, is that money is a useful tool that is worth pursuing - not with soul-destroying obsession, sure, but with some portion of your mind. It makes your life better, extends the reach of what you can do for others, enables you to leverage your intelligence to achieve more in life, etc. And since most of the ways of making money that people on this site would consider are honest and value-creating, if you do something clever and make money from it, it's well earned, well deserved.<p>The answer to the second point is, as I've repeated many times, that making money will not happen incidentally while you're looking somewhere else, or at least not in 99.9% of cases. If you like those odds, buy a lottery ticket. I can assure you that your mentor and his business associates spent a lot of time sweating the details of how their business model would make lots of money, before it did. That was no accident, and it was not solely the result of customer focus. It was the result of customer focus <i>and</i> commercial acumen. Both are essential.",1335183018

If you have good tech skills, a the default/fallback option is a pretty nice one, materially speaking: a low 6-figure programming job at a big company. There is very little chance of ending up unemployed-and-homeless, given how much companies are scrambling to hire technical people.<p>In that context, it makes more sense to me to encourage people to think about something other than money as their main/only goal. It is indeed something you can only afford to do if you're privileged enough to have the option, but being a tech person in Silicon Valley means there's a high probability that you do have the option, because if you ""fail"", you can always fail back to the 6-figure corporate job, which is a pretty soft landing.

Attaching an actor library to ""X"" language can give us many of the features offered by erlang with our existing codebase, and allow us to continue using our existing skills and paradigms.<p>Erlang does an excellent job at solving certain issues, but it's lacking in many other areas that ""X"" might do a better job of. If my project needs both the fault tolerance and concurrency of erlang, and feature ""A"" which language ""X"" is good at, but erlang not so good at, then choosing erlang all the time might not be the right solution.<p>I'm personally a fan of polyglot programming. We should pick the most suitable languages for each task, then we wouldn't need to keep re-inventing programming languages and libraries to emulate other languages. It's quite an idealistic view, but there's certainly ways we can improve the interoperability between languages, including erlang's - which is quite limited so far.<p>An example of such approach is the (now discontinued) Axum project from Microsoft Research. It offered many of the ideas of Erlang, but built onto the .NET framework and largely compatible with existing code. Axum could call, and could even contain almost any C# code inside it, although it was a restricted version of C# which had isolated states, and no static variables - something that high standard codebases omit anyway, regardless of the whether language allows it, because it's been known good practice for a long time that shared state causes problems.<p>The Actor Model existed long before Erlang, and will feature in many other languages other than it - whether or not they are successful is a different matter, but programming language designers would be wise to have a good knowledge of Erlang, and many other languages, so they're not re-inventing the wheel badly. Concurrency and fault tolerance should be considered from the start.<p>I personally think we can do better than Erlang - or at least offer the same without sacrificing every other paradigm to achieve the aims of erlang. (And Haskell will probably be the language to better it).",1335182512

When I put up the initial landing page for my latest startup ( <a href=""http://questcompanions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://questcompanions.com/</a> -- finally launching next week!), the 'Enlist' button said 'Start' instead.  Due to the non-traditional input box and the text on the button, people would just click 'Start'.  Due to a lack of error handling in the frontend code, the empty email would go up to my server, go out to Mailchimp, and they'd hand back an error.  All the user would see is ""Invalid or duplicate email"", then they'd move away.<p>When I integrated Mixpanel, I saw why immediately and was able to fix it, but by that point I'd already wasted an easy $10-20 on Facebook ad clicks leading to the page.  Tiny sum of money, but those were good clicks.  Implementing error handling, better button text, and slightly different text on the input box caused the conversion rate to go way up, and the rate of people clicking the button without filling in an email dropped to nearly zero.<p>Long story short, measure everything and be very, very smart about your messaging.",1335182481

We avoid working at companies that have a reputation for not respecting engineering talent. The difference is that we don't protect the malevolent or incompetent among us.

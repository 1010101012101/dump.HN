I once asked Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security, about this.

--<p>The implications of this reality have to be considered. The TSA does not exist to protect passengers on the planes.

So for example, you win a pot of 1000$ and the casino takes 100$ in rake from that. After rakeback you receive 30$ of that original rake.<p>1. Sites typically cap their rake at $3 per pot, so $100 is very unrealistic.<p>2. You qualify for return of the rake that you contributed by <i>playing</i> a pot, not by winning it. So if it folds to you in the blinds and you shove all-in and the big blind calls, that's two players who have put money in the pot. If they take $3 rake from that pot, you each get $1.50 contributed rake.<p>3. Not all sites use contributed rake. Some sites just equally divide the rake by all the players who received a hand, without regard to how much money they put in the pot.<p>As far as folding to profit from rakeback, let's look at a 1/2 game. If 40% of hands see a flop, and the average postflop pot is $20, we're looking at $1 rake per postflop pot for 40% of hands, so $0.40 rake per hand. Divide that 9 ways and you have about $0.045 rake paid per hand. Get 30% back, and you're only looking at 1.5 cents per hand, or 13 cents per orbit. You pay $3 per orbit in blinds, so clearly folding is not going to work to make any money.<p>""Rakeback pros"" (a derogatory term) make money by playing near-breakeven poker for a huge volume, let's say 250,000 hands per month (200 hours per month, 1250 hands per hour (a low estimate)).

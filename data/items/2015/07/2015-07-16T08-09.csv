One bit of evidence against this is the amount of the Extra&#x27;s script Ricky Gervais had to rerecord for an American audience. Most of the change was for unshared cultural references (local food brands etc.) and only a couple for words (fanny).<p>Due to the level of exposure, I believe the difference between generic Brit and generic US is less than the dialects within the countries e.g. older generations of Yorkshire vs. Cornish, Glaswegian vs. Cockney etc. can suffer great difficulties understanding each other.<p>The number of unshared words is much higher, methods of denotation and sentence construction are different and even the pronunciation of shared words become unrecognisable (I&#x27;m not a linguist, so open to correction). I&#x27;m sure there are similar extremes in the US.",1437037193

9896079,comment,9894014,9894014,0,0,crispweed,,,"If you have a child with OCD, or know someone who does, I really recommend this book: <a href=""http://www.dawnhuebnerphd.com/OvercomingOCD.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dawnhuebnerphd.com/OvercomingOCD.aspx</a>
(No affiliation with author!)
It takes a cognitive behavioural psychology approach, and is written in quite a child friendly way which works pretty well to defuse a lot of stuff that can get wrapped up with OCD. For example, OCD is very much about fear and fear about the fact that you are basically going insane can compound the whole thing, so just talking about and understanding what is going on can help a lot.
(For a child with OCD, it&#x27;s actually helpful to have a book which is a bit &#x27;childish&#x27;, i.e. targetted at a younger age group.)
Also, it&#x27;s a good thing to be aware of as a parent, and to watch out for if your child is taking a long time to get to bed, or whatever. If you have a child with OCD it&#x27;s really good to catch this and do something to help them with it, if possible, before puberty, when a bunch of other stuff can basically bundle on top..",1437037125

9896076,comment,9895838,9895838,0,0,nkoren,,,"There is no precise and official way to identify something as a &quot;language&quot; rather than a &quot;dialect&quot;.<p>For example: there are five major dialects of Hindi, some of which are mutually unintelligible -- yet few people call them separate languages. On the other hand, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with Urdu -- they use different writing systems, but as spoken languages are roughly as close as American and British English -- yet they are considered different languages. Similarly, China has a vast diversity of mutually unintelligible languages -- or, rather, what outsiders call &quot;languages&quot;, and what the Chinese government insists are merely dialects of a single language: &quot;Chinese&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s going on here? Max Weinreich&#x27;s quip that &quot;a language is a dialect with an army and a navy&quot; seems to hit the mark. If Britain and America had not become allies in the late 19th century, then the ongoing antipathy between them would have required their speaking systems to be classified as &quot;languages&quot;. But that would have been a political necessity, not a linguistic one.<p>As an aside -- as somebody who grew up in America and emigrated at age 31 to Britain -- I must say that the oft-cited differences in spelling and pronunciation are the least important areas of divergence. Much more significant (and confusing) are the idiomatic divergences. For example: in the UK, people commonly say &quot;are you alright?&quot; as a greeting, equivalent to the American &quot;how do you do?&quot; or &quot;what&#x27;s up?&quot;. But in American, &quot;are you alright?&quot; is an expression of serious concern -- something you might say to somebody walking around in a state of confusion with an apparent head injury. It was extremely disconcerting when people kept asking me this -- I thought I must be acting/looking really strange to provoke such continual concern!",1437037082

From what I&#x27;ve tried hard to forget: Everything is abbreviated, single letter functions everywhere.  The database is a giant persistent hash table, accessed through programming language variables, with no schema, types or type checking (keep in mind this is used to store <i>medical data</i>).  Everthing is global.  There&#x27;s virtually no structure in the language, I think they had subroutines but IIRC there were no named parameters.  Existing programs were just unreadable spaghetti.<p>Edit: Not Co-Star, but COSTAR:

For my purposes back in the 90&#x27;s, PostgresQL was the best fit and it has worked out well.<p>Meanwhile EHR systems have become a huge industry, but now having to catch up is hard.  Learning about VistA is mind-boggling in its scope and complexity, and especially since it has been open-sourced for a long time.  It&#x27;s a point of curiosity that it&#x27;s not been discussed more than a little here and there in the FOSS media.<p>So I appreciate the informative article, as it gives me some starting points to explore this vast field.  Might even give another stab at MUMPS, though it&#x27;s a hill to climb.  However some of the open-source projects that grew out of (or on top of) VistA offer some interesting ways of approaching it.<p>One project with immediate appeal to me is EWD.js, which is a node.js javascript implementation of server and client via WebSockets, and a MUMPS DB backend.  Should be interesting to try out.  <a href=""http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/EWDjs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/EWDjs.pdf</a><p>I could be wrong but it seems someone just starting out could find opportunities in the field of health care computing.  Given the political thrust to have EHRs everywhere seems logical the field will grow.<p>Above all, the need for security expertise in the EHR domain is enormous and will greatly expand in the next several years.  The FOSS aspects might well create openings for innovators with creative products and ideas to reduce the cost burdens that high-priced EHRs have been contributing to health care systems.",1437036992

It is also part of the specification for sh at opengroup.org:<p><a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/sh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/sh.h...</a><p>Interesting note about emacs mode though:<p>In early proposals, the KornShell-derived emacs mode of command line editing was included, even though the emacs editor itself was not. The community of emacs proponents was adamant that the full emacs editor not be standardized because they were concerned that an attempt to standardize this very powerful environment would encourage vendors to ship strictly conforming versions lacking the extensibility required by the community. The author of the original emacs program also expressed his desire to omit the program. Furthermore, there were a number of historical systems that did not include emacs, or included it without supporting it, but there were very few that did not include and support vi. The shell emacs command line editing mode was finally omitted because it became apparent that the KornShell version and the editor being distributed with the GNU system had diverged in some respects. The author of emacs requested that the POSIX emacs mode either be deleted or have a significant number of unspecified conditions. Although the KornShell author agreed to consider changes to bring the shell into alignment, the standard developers decided to defer specification at that time. At the time, it was assumed that convergence on an acceptable definition would occur for a subsequent draft, but that has not happened, and there appears to be no impetus to do so. In any case, implementations are free to offer additional command line editing modes based on the exact models of editors their users are most comfortable with.",1269460704

This is entirely based on my non-scientific monitoring of the various mailing lists, twitter feeds and articles. The big problem I personally have with Cassandra is that it is Java based. Not because I think Java is inherently bad, but rather because I don't know it well.<p>Personally, as long as I'm gonna jump into the nosql deep end and pick up some new skills I figured I would go full boar and spend some time with Riak (<a href=""http://riak.basho.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riak.basho.com/</a>). Not as mature as Cassandra or even MongoDB, Riak is Erlang based with strong support for JavaScript and the http protocol stack. Further, Riak adheres to Amazons Dynamo paper very closely which meshes well with my overall philosophy re. data distribution and persistence. Riak as a project is moving along well and if you spend anytime kicking the tires you'll soon notice what is lacking and start thinking about how to work around those issues. Needless to say, if you follow #riak on freenode you'll also get a feel for what Basho has in mind for the roadmap. From what I can gather, Lucene hooks of some flavor are in the works.",1269460313

I am sure CIA and other such agencies have blood on their hands, and they have done many morally questionable things in the name of 'national interest'.<p>For them morality is only manifested as legal limits -- the amount of stuff they can get away before being found legaly guilty of something. This means two things, they will try to influence the legislative branch to widen up the laws so they can have more 'freedom' (this happened after 9/11, Patriot Act, torture laws etc)., but it also means that they will do things that are clearly illegal if they are sure these things will never be publically released or opened. I think we are dealing with the later -- as set of things that will be hidden forever but un-exectedly got out.<p>Wikileaks breaks govt.'s modus operandi.  At some point there will be a person working for them that will hold morility above their freedom, and professional duty ( and /put tin foil hat on possibly their life).  In the past it was much easier to handle and contain such leaks, this becomes much harder with the wikileaks infrastructure.<p>I am not defending the government here.

Sure, you can insist that people ought to cook everything from scratch, but given modern lifestyles this is really just a moral high horse, and stands little chance of being realistic advice that will be followed. Not to mention that a <i>lot</i> of home cooking is dangerously unhealthy for you (meatloaf, anyone?).<p>The information that led to my dramatic weight loss wasn't some kind of holy secret grail, it was simply training on what foods I need, how much of it I need, how to read nutritional labels, and the common pitfalls (e.g., trading fat for sodium) that one ought to watch out for. Instead of harping ""fries are bad for you!"" the program taught me was <i>was</i> good for me, which in the end was infinitely more helpful. We publish a pretty good guide on food groups and recommended servings, but the whole system doesn't account for the world of processed, industrialized food we live in today. How good are those crackers? Unsalted? What does that mean? It can still be an invitation to a coronary unless you are smart about scrutinizing labels.<p>> <i>""obesity is less about knowing what is in your food and simply eating less of it""</i><p>True and false. Most obese people (including myself) eat too much, but much of it has to do with <i>what</i> is being eaten as well. Trading fat for carbs, trading fat for sodium, etc etc, all contribute to bad health.<p>Also, nutritional education also opened my eyes on <i>how</i> bad certain foods are for you. We intuitively know burgers and fries are bad - but <i>how</i> bad? Even most ""normals"" don't know this quantitatively, and this knowledge has helped me avoid a lot of foods. There are shades of ""bad for you"", and it's important to know this. ""Stop eating burgers and ice cream"" is a moralistic stance to take, and technically correct, but ultimately unhelpful.",1269460054

You didn't stop being obese until you chose to act on the available information.<p>What makes you think that a significant number of other people are different?<p>Like you, most obese people know where to get the relevant information (if they don't have it already).

1216573,comment,1215736,1216250,0,0,fnid2,,,"Is there a correlation between the availability of good information and informed decisions? We know that fast food is bad for us. Even stepping inside one to buy something means that you're going to get something not good for you.  Availability of information at McDonald's does not help you buy and consume good food, because if you are <i>at</i> McDonald's it's already too late.<p>You are probably an exception because you were motivated to lose the weight in the first place.  I suppose I'm one of the lucky skinny types that overweight people hate, but it seems to me that obesity is less about knowing what is in your food and simply eating less of it.  If calories consumed are greater than calories burned, you gain weight.<p>While traveling around Europe, I happened to be at the same hostel as a Canadian doctor and he was more than happy to share lots of opinions with me -- especially about the U.S. health care system.  So I asked him about weight and food. He said simply: People get fat because they eat too much.  He also said, drink a lot of water and eat slower.<p>Later, I read an article that most people can't tell the difference between thirst and hunger.  If you drink water when you <i>feel</i> hungry, often the hunger pangs go away.  Of course that couldn't be true for me!  So I tested it and sure enough, when I got hungry, I'd drink water and I wouldn't be hungry anymore.<p>Food is just like TV or cigarettes.  It alleviates boredom. It gives us a good feeling to eat.  We eat foods that are too dense with calories.  Steak. Chicken. Twinkies.  We are emotionally trained to think meat is better.  In my rural area, vegetarians are <i>weird</i>.  ""You don't eat meat??  Why?!?  OMG, I could never live without meat. What are you a sissy?""<p>But it isn't like that.  Food is mostly emotional -- always has been. The reason all those women in the really old paintings are plump is because it was a sign of wealth.  Rich kings could keep their women fat.  Turns out they were the ones who could afford to pay painters as well, so we don't see all the skinny people who lived back then, but skinny is the norm, not the rule.<p>In the U.S., people think it is hard to be skinny, when the opposite is true -- it's hard to get fat.<p>Funny that your username is potatolicious and you're commenting on a food thread...",1269457842

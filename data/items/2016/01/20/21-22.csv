WISE was able to detect objects the size of Neptune (17x the mass of Earth) out to about 700 AU, so it should be possible to find the object proposed by the Caltech astronomers here (10x the mass of Earth at around 600 AU).  I don&#x27;t know if WISE&#x27;s current condition would allow it to perform such a search, as it&#x27;s completely out of coolant.",1453327184

It&#x27;s OK for something like a firesale at your favorite retailer, but definitely not good on a more intimate scale, like a job or investment. If they actually want you, they&#x27;ll let you take your time regardless of what their offer says, and an exploding offer is a big signal that you probably don&#x27;t really want to work with them.",1453327164

10941687,comment,10937704,10937964,0,0,nugget,,,"I tend to agree with you but I also think that the IAB is recognizing the unique threat that ABP specifically (as opposed to adblocking generally) poses to the industry.  I&#x27;ll explain what I mean.<p>ABP has a mafia-style business model based on extorting advertisers for inclusion on an acceptable ads list.  Whether you agree with the concept of acceptable ads or not, it&#x27;s pretty clear that ABP&#x27;s narrative is hollow and their implementation is focused on their own bottom line: nearly every programmatic ad exchange who is willing to pay money is whitelisted as &#x27;&#x27;acceptable&#x27;&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a client-side tollbooth erected between users and the sites they visit, extracting money from the ecosystem for little value in return.  At some point it isn&#x27;t even &#x27;&#x27;adblock&#x27;&#x27; any more because so many ads are whitelisted, and (as a former user) I think ABP clearly passed that point awhile back.  Their brand, momentum, and marketing allow them to keep users captive.  There&#x27;s probably opportunity in creating new adblock clients with no whitelist, growing the userbase, and then selling out to someone with an acceptable ads list, as there should be slow but eventual migration (which uBlock&#x27;s growth points to).<p>At the point that the acceptable ads business model becomes normalized, it&#x27;s fair to ask, where does it end?  You will see every company with client software rolling out adblocking features (with tollbooth, of course).  It&#x27;s senseless, inefficient, and doesn&#x27;t reward good actors (actually, likely rewards bad actors).  I&#x27;m not saying that web publishers and their ad tech minions didn&#x27;t bring this sandstorm upon themselves (I believe they did, and shed no tears for them), but even so, the future of the web is not dueling mobs of client-side adblocking thugs with variable rate cards for ad networks to bypass their intended functionality.  At least I hope it&#x27;s not.<p>I&#x27;m no fan of the IAB but I can at least admit to being impressed that someone there had the insight to take this stand, if that&#x27;s indeed what it is.",1453326998

Glad to find out that Dan feels the same way, according to the tweets linked to in this article [1].<p>Has there been any efforts to make use of js-csp [2] to handle async operations in Redux, like how ClojureScript apps make use of core.async channels?<p>Cycle.js definitely looks promising, but I have a vague suspicion that its approach of handling effects strictly through the output of the main function, although elegant, might make interop with the rest of the JS ecosystem a lot more painful, since many JS libraries don&#x27;t have such clean separation of concerns. I believe JS interop is also one of the most commonly cited pain points for working with Elm as well, which uses a similar approach.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/689639582120415232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/689639582120415232</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp</a>",1453326881

The examples given in the blog seem mostly about syntax/verbosity in nature which is not as interesting as evolving clarity of thought and mental overhead.<p>I haven&#x27;t explored Cycle.js or Elm, but a few comments on the React/Redux side as I&#x27;ve recently adopted it at work and have found it to be a huge pleasure to work with. There does tend to be a lot of syntactic boilerplate/wiring up of things in Redux which is definitely a bit of a drag, but the most important thing that Redux has done for me is make data flow very clear and easy to trace and understand. Even with Facebook&#x27;s impls of Flux, and Backbone before that, data flow was very tricky and cloudy at best.<p>As for the criticism that setup has a lot of moving pieces, I sort of agree, but I found myself up and running in a few hours after reading the (incredibly well written) documentation and within a few days I was already more productive than I was previously without Redux.<p><i>Elm also gets out your way by having immutable types built-in, signals built-in, “dispatcher” (Mailbox) built-in, and ADTs for action types built-in. The experience is great for a developer and the initial setup is quicker.</i><p>Built-ins are a tradeoff just like anything else. Redux gives you enough to get going, and has a strong ecosystem and community of libs that most people will use (react-redux, thunk middleware). Built-ins might help you get started faster, but maybe that doesn&#x27;t fly for a company of 100 engineers where use cases vary and customization is important.<p>Lastly, the author claims Cycle.js lets you &#x27;focus on features&#x27;. From past experience, this makes it sound like there&#x27;s just a lot of magic and it&#x27;s easy to get lost in it all (see Rails). This may or may not be the case with Cycle.js, but that is immediately my gut reaction. I feel Redux gives a pretty powerful philosophy and clear way to handle front-end apps that can scale well to larger apps. If there are some things Cycle.js is doing well over Redux, I want to hear more about those! The arguments against Redux without that context feel pretty weak.",1453326744

Users generally knew before us that this or that application was not working. The monitoring tools we were using only checked the status of routers and servers and were not good at detecting partial/performance failures that users experienced.<p>NetBeez agents monitor the network and applications from the user perspective. You can apt-get our software agent and install it on different linux boxes, then start running PING, DNS, HTTP, and Traceroute tests agains web applications. By doing so you catch two birds with one stone, because you validate (1) network connectivity and performance at the locations where the agents are installed and (2) detect problems with the web application itself.

That&#x27;s probably necessary, but it makes it harder to put tubes in freeway medians.<p>Nobody seems to have a good solution to emergency escape. There&#x27;s an assumption that vehicles can be pushed or driven to the next station. That&#x27;s probably not good enough. Experience with subways and Eurotunnel indicates the need for escape systems.  Emergency exits at the ends of cars, escape stations from the tubes, and emergency repressurization systems for the tubes will probably be necessary.  Airlock doors across the tube will be needed so you can repressurize a section rapidly, without waiting to repressurize hundreds of miles of tube. That&#x27;s all possible, but it adds cost. Remember, the whole point of this is that it&#x27;s supposed to be much cheaper than maglev, because the tube is cheap and dumb.<p>This is a classic problem with monorails, too. Look at pictures of fictional monorails[2] vs pictures of real ones.[3]  The real ones have bigger and heavier track. Single track sections usually have walkways, while double track sections can use a rescue train on a parallel track.  Here&#x27;s a list of monorail fires and evacuations.[4] Remember that Hyperloop cars are powered by lithium batteries.<p>At least HTT is trying to build a closed loop.  Musk&#x27;s prototype is just a straight run. Straight is easy for this; it&#x27;s turns that are hard. Turn radius is the big constraint on high speed anything - route planning and land acquisition are very tough for large turn radii. That&#x27;s why the Northeast Corridor rail system runs so slowly.<p>Maybe people will be more tolerant of high-G turns if roller coaster videos are played inside.<p>The Hyperloop system is probably buildable.

No Money processing is done in JS (maybe because JS lack BigDecimal? or no standard Money library that deals with ISO-level currency?).<p>LinkedIN used NodeJS for their mobile app back-end if I recalled. I would assume that NodeJS is just a front-end appserver talking to myriad back-end microservices written in other languages.<p>So this is where I stand given the lack of good stable solid libraries provided by NodeJS: its place is just sitting as a gateway front-end appserver that pass processed request to a bunch of services in the back-end and get response back from those services, do minimum massaging, and spits JSON back to the front-end. This is why I kind of labelled NodeJS as a niche. Sure, Trello uses NodeJS all the way left and right but I suppose you can write web-app back-end using Go or C++ too. Painful but works.<p>My faith in JS for back-end is definitely pretty low given that working with either callback or promise isn&#x27;t fun but that&#x27;s personal preference more than anything else.<p>Anyhow...

Putting that aside, this section seems unfair at best. Firstly the JSX syntax is disregarded due to verbosity[0]. Okay, not to everyone&#x27;s taste. However the author then goes on to making a comparison between React&#x27;s createElement/createFactory APIs and the hyperscript-helpers npm package, which is incredibly uncharitable as the former is a performant, low level API intended for building ergonomic APIs on top of, and the latter is a high level, ergonomics-centric API.<p>Redux is a small library, which needs to be used underneath  application-specific abstractions to avoid boilerplate. Not everyone will want to come up with such abstractions themselves. I can certainly see the value for an ergonomic, high-level, Rails-like project on top of React + Redux.

And I&#x27;m perfectly find that you question the performance :) I encourage you to try it out.<p>My first problem/observation is that Haar cascades looove running on a GPU due to their Float-y nature. But dealing with them on a CPU frankly stinks. I was getting 1 frame/10 seconds at 800x600 with the included Haar face detector. That&#x27;s effectively unusable.<p>Turns out there&#x27;s also LBP cascades, which are integer based. And they run <i>fast</i> on a cpu. But, from my observations, they have many false positives. But they seem to have no issue with false negatives, so I grab all the faces, plus a few &quot;junks&quot;.<p>The speedup is, is that I can use an LBP and then throw the region of interest (the potential face) onto a Haar cascade eye detector. Now that I&#x27;m dealing with much smaller pictures, haar runs acceptably. Literally, if \n(eyes.size > 0){is valid face.....}<p>Then I proceed to use the built in function on OpenCV contrib Face library.  The problems with the library are numerous. Mainly, the settings are provided without good descriptions, or whatever the defaults of whatever academic papers had them set as.<p>Because I&#x27;m also an academic, I was able to get ahold of quite a few large datasets of face data. After doing so, I wrote a few small programs that attempted to calculate the ideal settings for the FaceRecognizer call, which I believe I did so. (The settings are in the call, in the source.)<p>Of course, I do get some slowdowns depending on how many faces there are (mainly, stay away from google searches for faces).

For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree with the parent that whether Avery is guilty or not is secondary to the miscarriage of justice that has clearly happened.<p>The physical evidence on the car itself is suspicious: (1) there were no fingerprints, yet there were blood; (2) at least one smudge looks _exactly_ like a bloodstain would look if you applied with a Q-tip [1]; (3) from the armchair perspective of someone who has only seen the not-terribly-high-resolution photos, Halbach&#x27;s blood looks rusty, whereas Avery&#x27;s blood looks bright red, almost a week after supposedly dropped there (EDTA-preserved blood does not fade like normal blood); (4) the dashboard blood is unlikely given the position of the cut on Avery&#x27;s hand [2].<p>What Kratz claimed was &quot;sweat DNA&quot; (there&#x27;s really no such thing) on the hood latch was only <i>speculated</i> as such, and was never entered as evidence in the trial because it was considered contaminated; the technician did not switch gloves after examining the inside of the car and then touching the hood. It&#x27;s worth adding that it&#x27;s evident from transcripts that the investigators certainly imprinted Brendan Dassey with the idea that Avery had opened the hood; this is also the case with the other details that Dassey comes up with that match the investigator&#x27;s evidence. Don&#x27;t forget that Dassey also said a ton of things which could not possibly be true, such as Avery cutting Halbach&#x27;s throat in the bedroom. (The investigators also tried to get Dassey to confess that Avery had molested him; they quickly give up when Dassey describes Avery playfully trying to grab his genitals during play wrestling. Yet the molestation part has been repeated by the press.)<p>The key found in Avery&#x27;s trailer is also highly suspicious. (1) It was supposedly found after numerous searches, and the investigators claimed to find it only after violently rattling the bookcase they claimed it must have fallen out of, despite the photo evidence showing that it could not possibly have happened that way (notice the coins on top of the bookcase). (2) The key was a spare; at least one photo shows that Halbach had a larger keychain, never recovered. (3) Only Avery&#x27;s DNA was recovered from the keychain, but no other DNA, not even Halbach&#x27;s.<p>As for the calls, prosecution tried to frame the narrative to make it seem Halbach was extremely uncomfortable with Avery. However, she had visited his home many times, which easily also explains why he specifically requested her. She would have known that the seller of the car, &quot;B. Janda&quot;, was Barbara Janda, Steve Avery&#x27;s sister and immediate neighbor. The only evidence of Halbach&#x27;s &quot;discomfort&quot; was that she had once told a colleague about how Avery had once opened the door wearing only a towel, which she found distasteful. Apparently Avery frequently hid his caller ID; he also called her <i>with</i> caller ID. This isn&#x27;t even circumstantial.<p>There are a bunch of other points, not touched upon in the documentary, worth adding: For example, the prosecution clearly were not able to determine where the crime scene was — the lack of blood evidence shows the garage could not possibly have been the place of the murder. There are several clear signs that she was murdered elsewhere, and also that she was not burned next to Avery&#x27;s house. The sheriff ignored an anonymous letter, received early in the investigation, stating that the smelter had been used to burn a body the night following Halbach&#x27;s disappearance. The woman who found Halbach&#x27;s car specifically requested (and was the only one to do so) to be permitted to search the Avery property, and she found the car after just a few minutes of walking among hundreds (or thousands) of cars, which seems too absurd to be a coincidence. And so on.<p>A lot of good discussion is happening on Reddit [3] these days, most of it pleasingly level-headed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/4VXXzvB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/4VXXzvB.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Br9KET3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/Br9KET3.png</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/</a>",1453324571

For a pre 1.0 project it&#x27;s surprisingly stable and once you figure out what you&#x27;re doing I&#x27;ve been able to move relatively quickly.<p>The big holdup has been the supporting libraries. Some have been an absolute mess  but the solution to that is that once I got it working, just don&#x27;t touch it and don&#x27;t buy into the promises that it&#x27;s always going to be the next version that solves the issues. I didn&#x27;t opt for Redux and went with Fluxxor instead which has worked reasonably well but I kept getting errors and ended up forking it to fix the problem. I&#x27;m not going to go back and use Redux for everything because someone told me it&#x27;s better.<p>I am now on my 3rd build tool over this timeline. I am now on Webpack because people kept promising that the next one would be better. I struggled to finally get React-Hotloader to work and occasionally it works but most of the time I just get Invariant Violation errors and have to do a full reload.

Once you have a working solution there isn&#x27;t really much incentive to change things. This guy laments that there is not a good way to do pure JS instead of JSX but you know what? JSX is fine. I already need a build tool to use ES6, and as long as you are consistent you shouldn&#x27;t run into too many issues using the pure JS solution that comes with React if that&#x27;s what you really want to do. \nJSX might be ugly but I would rather just deal with the ugliness and settle for good enough then keep creating extra work for myself in search of perfect.<p>My goal is to build an app. I don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to try out libraries like cycle or elm every time someone brags about how perfect they are just because they might provide me with a little benefit in terms of ease of development.

10941413,comment,10937633,10941047,0,0,superuser2,,,"These are real problems. However they are solved elegantly by central banking, and indeed that is what we have in the US: ACH and FedWire. Each bank holds an account with the Federal Reserve, and can make cheap instantaneous or free nightly batch transfers between its Fed account and other banks&#x27; Fed accounts. The strong central system extracting guarantees and ensuring minimal abuse is a major production, but we still use it for all electronic transfers.<p>The problem is that many American banks <i>also</i> process their own transfers in a nightly batch on the same 60s mainframe application they&#x27;ve been using since mainframes were cool.<p>First business night: money is taken out of your account.<p>Second business night: money is moved between banks via the Fed.<p>Third business night: money from the Fed is credited to recipient account.<p>If both banks were to actually do online transaction processing (like MC/Visa) then you&#x27;d only wait for the Fed&#x27;s nightly batch. Some institutions like Alliant Credit Union have the rare differentiator of actually transacting with you and the Fed on the same day, instead of in separate nightly batches.<p>FedWire is actually instantaneous settlement, but the banks have all apparently conspired to charge an enormous markup on it. It doesn&#x27;t help that cheap ubiquitous wires would outright destroy MC/Visa, who effectively get to tax all consumer spending by being the only system with live/online transaction processing for authorizations.",1453324465

I work well at that time of day and there are times when I would love to just keep cranking away.  Maybe some of them, like btilly says, get there late.  I could see that working: spend some time with the kid(s) in the morning and then work later.",1276848434

Different people really have different needs, and it's very hard to define open salaries without having a ridiculously complex system. For example, some people have a family to support, others don't; some need financial help relocating, others don't, yet others are local; sometimes people have domain knowledge you just can't pass on, and you have to pay them outside the range to convince them to join. Equity makes things even more complex, and different people are interested equity/salary ratio.<p>We're pretty committed to the open system, but you can see how it can get really complex really fast, and is very difficult to implement. It works well for us so far, but I wonder how well it will scale as we grow.",1276848414

Web? Got that too. How about via an iPhone or Android? Check.<p>In Clayton Christensen's book The Innovator's Dilemma, he discusses two types of disruptive innovations:<p>1) Low-end disruptions<p>These serve less demanding customers with low-priced, relatively straightforward offerings using low-cost business models. Look for markets with over-served customers and offer a simpler product or service.<p>2) New-market disruptions<p>These serve new customers by making it easier for them to do something that previously required being or hiring specialists. Look for unfulfilled needs and create new products or services for them.<p>Posterous is a great example of a low-end disruption. They're offering a product so damn simple that few realized it would have such an impact (like Dustin Curtis). And now they've got features that early adopters and perhaps some early majority want as well (the rich-text editor). Pretty shrewd of them.",1276848333

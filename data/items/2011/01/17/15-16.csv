2112462,comment,2111278,2111278,0,0,cplamper,,,"Hi,<p>long time lurker here, but now felt compelled to open an account and post.<p>Your post hits very close to home to me. I'm deaf on my left ear, nearly deaf on my right ear after being born hard of hearing and having a series of hearing losses during my childhood and teenage years. I can't phone, can't understand anything on TV, podcasts etc. but can converse quite well in one-to-one talks and very small groups of 2-3 people. I don't know any sign language. I have massive problems in noisy environments or really large groups. Accents are also difficult. Lip reading and a hearing aid helps. Luckily I've had amazing parents who made sure that I received a good education and can speak and write very well. I also like presenting and speaking in front of large groups. Unfortunately too many deaf people have really weak spelling and oral speaking skills.<p>Networking has long been something that I dread and tend to avoid. I am a young German marketing consultant (freelancing mostly for other consulting groups and startups) and - as yourself - a wannabe entrepreneur. So networking is a must. I constantly have to find new clients, new projects, new trends and markets to tap into. My biggest problem is that phone calls don't work. I ask for IM or video chats via Skype instead. It's still a massive problem when the other person doesn't know about your disability yet or when you're dealing with a conservative client (typically people in larger companies). Phone calls are an issue which I have not yet fully solved.<p>Some advice:<p>* I hate approaching people as the environment is often noisy and it's akward to explain that you're deaf or hard of hearing. When attending conferences or meetups ask for the list of attendees beforehand. Try to set up meetings and plan your pitch. Most people will be understanding and you have a list of people you can connect with. Wear nametags always. Have really minimalistic business cards ready with only your name, your company and your e-mail address and your skype/IM handle. Turn down meetups where you know it will be extremely noisy or where there is background music playing. Ask attendees for personal meetings the evening before or day after instead.<p>* Get yourself an iPad or another tablet where you can demonstrate your product for other people to see. Have it with you always.<p>* Obviously: Ask for IM or Skype video chat instead of phone calls. Better yet: Set up your own secured Jabber chat server for technically inclined clients or contacts and if possible a secured chat site, too.<p>* Have an incredible elevator pitch ready for IM, e-mail etc.<p>* (I know it sucks) On your website - should you have one - always say you're deaf or hard of hearing. It establishes trust and causes people not to be surprised when you decline phone calls.<p>* Ask other people to introduce you and if necessary explain that you're deaf/hard of hearing. Use other people, even your parents. Don't be too proud for this but always explain why it is important for you and what you gain by it.<p>* Create a blog where you demonstrate knowledge of tech, markets etc. This makes it easier to evaluate your skills without contacting you. Same goes for social networking.<p>* If you have a product, a popular website or a lot of people trying to contact you use a virtual call center which collects and answers questions, contacts and mails/IMs everything to you.<p>* Be incredibly persistent. It's very easy to get discouraged when getting a bunch of new contacts and each one requests a phone call. I set myself a goal to get ten new contacts per month to a face-to-face meeting or an IM chat and reward myself when hitting the goal.<p>* The best though would be to work in large companies or in a larger team. Solo freelancing or starting a company yourself without being able to phone is incredible hard if not downright impossible (I tried it myself). Ultimately you need people who handle phone calls for you and who assist you in handling issues with clients. It really takes a lot of weight off your plate. The only reason why I'm doing freelancing is that right now I have stable clients who pay the bill.<p>Best of luck and feel free to contact me anytime.",1295279944

2112453,comment,2112358,2112358,0,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>I'd like to learn programming but I have trouble finding the right starting place.</i><p>There is no <i>right</i> starting place.  There are lots of good starting places though.  What have you looked at so far?  Have you tried anything yet?<p><i>What language should I pick up if I am interested in creating a dynamic website?</i><p>Expect at least one ""use X"" answer from fanbois of every language ""X"" in existence.   Ultimately you can use Java, Python, Groovy, Scala, Ruby, Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, Fortran, or COBOL; whatever floats your boat.  But if you're looking for a recommendation for a language that's particularly good for ""Getting started,""  I'll throw out Groovy, Python and Ruby as good choices, especially if your interest is in building web-apps.  You'll also want to learn some Javascript in either case.<p><i>How can one get started learning something like Python or JQuery?</i><p>Buy a book titled something like ""Learning Python"" or ""JQuery in Action.""  Google ""Python tutorial"" or ""JQuery tutorial.""  Go to the python.org website and/or the jquery.org website and browse the docs... look for links like ""tutorial"" or ""Getting started.""  Start writing code.  Get stuck, Google for answers... get really stuck, post questions on Stackoverflow or on relevant mailing lists.  Pick a project to build and start building it... iterate over those last few steps.  Find a user's group for the language you pick in your area.  Attend the meetings and ""hack nights"" (if they do something like that.)  Write more code.  Look for interesting videos on youtube, watch those.  The Google Tech Talks series offers all sorts of stuff.  Write up a blog post when you learn something cool or implement something interesting.    Fork interesting projects on Github and play around with them.  Make some minor improvement or add some new feature.  Release an open-source project on Github.<p>If you get that far, you should be good to go.

2112451,comment,2109993,2112415,0,0,trezor,,,"I actually think hardware stability, predictability and closeness is central for this to work.<p>Once a platform is new, nobody really knows what it can do and how it can best be exploited. Like on the Commodre 64, you had a limit of 8 hardware sprites, each one either 32x32 pixels mono-coloured or 16x32 pixels tri-coloured (iirc). This didn't really allow you to do much fancy games or graphics.<p>But once people discovered that you could <i>reuse</i> those same sprites multiple times during a single screen-refresh by timing your sprite-programming to whatever scan-line the machine was outputting, the genuine was out of the box: The Commodore 64 and its games would never be the same again.<p>With changing hardware or a hardware abstraction layer, this would probably never have been possible to do reliably or at all. I'm willing to guess that having hardware stability, predictability and closeness can be listed as a requirement for allowing developers and games over time to discover just how far something can be stretched.<p>For phones and a million other different mobile appliances I think this will be much harder, although not impossible. I doubt will see the same sort of mad capability leaps over time on these devices. But hey, you never know ;)",1295279732

For socializing in groups I can't help much (I'm still trying to figure that one out), but for taking questions at conferences or presentations, you should consider CART. For phone calls, if you want to avoid the coldness of Relay, consider the VCO variation.<p>Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) is what I used sporadically throughout college to understand those professors with a particularly heavy accent, and consists of a person in the audience typing out the audience questions  on a laptop or transcribing machine. You hold a pager-like device which the typing is transmitted to. There's a slight delay while they type, but I found CART transcribers on a whole to be quite a bit better than Relay transcribers, in terms of speed. The downside is that it is expensive, $100-$200/hr here in the States, so it's only viable for important presentations. I was lucky in that my university had an accessibility program and covered this expense for me.<p>For phone calls (not so much busy conference calls, too slow), IF you are confident in your speaking voice and want to be able to convey the emotions behind your words, see if you have Voice Carry Over (VCO) available to you. This variation on relay is a 3-way call between you and the person you want to talk to, with the relay operator on the line as a non-speaking party. They will type the speech of the other party out for you, and you can speak for yourself.",1295278531

Don't get too hung up on the analogy: a rock star programmer isn't one who's into sex & drugs & loop unrolls.<p>The main origins of this meme revolve around some studies done many years ago that show there's a productivity difference of 10x to 20x from mediocre programmers and the top performers. It's been noted that the salary range is much smaller, often in the 2x range. So why not hire top performers, paying them twice as much and getting ten times the productivity?<p>There is and has been ongoing controversy about this on several fronts. The most substantial criticisms have to do with the validity of the studies. The rest of the criticisms seems to revolve around pushback from people because hiring rockstar programmers is difficult and care and feeding of such doesn't fit within the management structure of most companies.",1295276427

If there's a country that knows about Airport security, it's Israel, for obvious reasons.<p>Let me tell you this - most of the security procedures in U.S airports are pointless and ridicules. Taking off your shoes and your belt. Holding your hands in front of a screen. Pat downs. We have the technology to avoid this (and have had it for the past 20+ years). If you've been to Israel, you know it's a completely different procedure, and I can guarantee you it's way more secure. They focus more on behavior profiling through multiple inspection points and with a series of questions they ask you AS YOU WAIT IN LINE for checking in your luggage. No fuss, no body strip checks, no taking off pieces of clothing. X-ray screening is done by simply walking through the machine, while your baggage passes a different machine.<p>Airport security in the U.S feels like the result of bureaucracy and procedure for the sake of appearance.<p>EDIT: clarified what I meant by profiling.",1360796388

To them, I'm a second-class citizen - no question about it.<p>I avoid flying like the plague; I'd gladly take a 12 hour train ride over a 2 hour flight <i>just</i> to avoid this treatment.<p>It's been 12 years, and I still haven't gotten used to the degradation. I hope I never do.<p>> Because I remember the peace and freedom I long enjoyed here to welcome visitors to the United States from around the world, I want the leaders and active participants in terrorist networks to identified through constant surveillance and intelligence, and I want terrorists to be attacked relentlessly where they live, so that they have to hide in caves while people all over the world who renounce their goals get to lead civilized, peaceful lives in the Twenty-First Century.<p>There's a certain degree of irony in that statement; the Beirut bombing, the (first) World Trade Center bombing attack, and 9/11 were, at least in large part, a response to the destruction that the US has been wreaking on foreign soil for years.<p>> The people who are destroying diplomatic buildings and killing diplomats are declining to use thoughtful discussion to show that they are anything other than blights on humankind<p>This same line of reasoning could be applied to the US - we're a little bit better at disguising it, but we've been responsible for terrorism abroad (and domestically!) for <i>decades</i>.",1360796296

Totally unsorted dump at the moment, I'll eventually sort through it, but might still be useful.<p>Yesterday I spent the whole day watching a Google tech talk by Hadley Wiggins (creator of GGPlot) talking about exploratory data analysis with ggplot and plyr, and replicating every single step in RStudio with RMarkdown (mix of code and text). I played with every single line, took arguments apart, tried out variations, until I understand what each piece did.<p>Here are my notes: <a href=""http://rpubs.com/houshuang/ggplot-notes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rpubs.com/houshuang/ggplot-notes</a> (RStudio makes it ridiculously easy to publish these kinds of documents online).

It would be a lot of fuss and hard to interest reformers in, while easily arousing lobbying pushback from trolls. There would be continual pressure to compromise the purity of a well tuned working system into something that still has room for the trolls to continue their trolling. And when the spotlight was off it, it would start to slip back towards the way it was, with extension bills being nodded through.<p>Honestly it'd be both simpler to rouse interest for, and simpler to argue for, a total repeal. The squawking would be louder, but the final result would throw the ball back into the troll's court - to sneakily extend something is a lot easier than to re-implement it when it has been scrapped entirely.",1360796152

There is no evidence presented. It just presents a metaphor that explains what he thinks is going on not what causes it or if it even exists in the way he thinks it does. Is there some part of it that I am missing?<p>><i>It's not there to condone or promote sexism (or racism or any other unfair discrimination) towards straight white males.</i><p>It could be argued that constantly telling men (and boys) that they have it easier without presenting evidence of specific areas where this is true is sexist as well as damaging to both men and women.<p>><i>If your whole point is ""well, it's not right to be sexist towards men either"", then I agree with you completely, but the relevance of your claim is questionable in this discussion</i><p>My original comment was in reply to klodolph's assertion that sexism towards men is so far fetched that one needs to imagine some alternate reality to our own where sexism towards men exists in order for a man to understand sexism. My argument is that it does exist in this reality and it is far more wide spread than people would have you believe. Klodolph claims that I misunderstood their use of this alternate reality argument so that makes my original comment pointless. Subsequently, halostatue replied with an extremely frustrating comment that suggested that any issue a man has with regards to sexism is always inconsequential because some author wrote a blog post where he claims that men always have it easier to anyone else in the same position. Not only does that make very little sense but condoning the dismissal of sexism towards men in such a way is sexist in itself.<p>I replied to your post because I am tired of this belief that men need to imagine what sexism feels like in order to understand it. We don't need to imagine what sexism feels like because we experience it all of the time, just like women do.<p>><i>1) nobody originally claimed it's right to be sexist to men</i><p>Yes nobody claimed that it's right to be sexist towards men but no one seems to acknowledge that it even exists on the scale that it does.<p>><i>sexism towards women is so much more prevalent, especially in our industry, that it's a problem that has higher priority than sexism towards men.</i><p>This is difficult. I honestly do not know which type of sexism is more prevalent but I feel that that is irrelevant because sexism needs to be seen as a single issue, not as two different issues. In order to get rid of sexism you need to do it in a non sexist way otherwise, you are merely shifting sexism from one group to another. Perpetrating sexism towards men in order to solve (or while solving) sexism towards women does nothing but but cause anger and frustration among men and women.",1360795869

I've talked with people who, having gained this insight through LSD, psilocybin, or other methods, gain an interest in meditation.<p>Either way, it's not so much that it cuts through socialized anxiety. Another insight you gain from this kind of experience is realizing how much you participated in creating the socialized anxiety within you. The anxiety doesn't go away so much as you become less attached to it. Being less attached to it, you see how it no longer serves a purpose in your life, and you're free to pay attention to the stuff that is more important. Like experiencing what time you have left -- and make no mistake, whether you have a terminal cancer, or not (or whether we make it to technology that allows someone to transfer personality into silicon), you too will eventually die.<p>One day, I hope that we'll have socially sanctioned initiations, not just for treating existential anxiety in people facing terminal illness.

5216204,comment,5215820,5215820,63,0,tokenadult,,,"I remember a more innocent time almost three decades ago when my work involved frequent flying, such that I have been to most major airports in the United States repeatedly and have logged weeks above 30,000 feet of altitude. I have a photograph from those days showing me seated at the controls of a commercial airliner, which the crew of the airliner took after I boarded a flight early in the boarding process. In those days a business traveler could sit down to pose for a snapshot inside the aircraft cockpit, with the crew having no concerns about a person who was not an airline employee being there. That's the carefree ease of flying in the United States I remember from the beginning of my adulthood.<p>1329 days ago I wrote here on HN, in reponse to one of the recurring complaints about airport security procedures, ""Hear. Hear. I was just on flights out of town over the weekend, and it occurred to me that the terrorists have won by making air travel so inconvenient and annoying for every American who ever flies domestically. 'Maybe Secure Flight is a good use of our money; maybe it isn't. But let's have debates like that in the open, as part of the budget process, where it belongs.' This is the general answer for review of current security procedures: we should check whether they are worthwhile for the amount of improved security they promise to provide.""<p>334 days ago another participant, who came to the United States from another country, wrote,<p><i>It's also the only place that made me take my shoes off before the metal detector, which I found quite humiliating</i><p>This appears to have been one of the calculations of the terrorist group that put up the shoe bomber<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_shoe_bomb_plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_shoe_bomb_plot</a><p>to trying his failed attempt to blow up an airplane with a bomb hidden in his shoe. Some of the co-religionists of some of those terrorists consider it extremely degrading to be bare-footed in certain situations deemed to be ""holy"" situations (I know this from having been warned about how I oriented my feet in flip-flop sandals once when I was overseas in 1984), and thus they have probably been glad to humiliate Americans as Americans have reacted to the failed shoe bomb plot. My proposal is that United States airport security give up on requesting passengers to remove shoes. Yeah, maybe have chemical sensing devices with air intakes at floor level to screen for bombs on shoes, but let us all wear our shoes onto airplanes and throughout the insides of airports. The screening procedures at present appear to be an overreaction to the actual risk of a shoe bomb destroying a passenger airplane, especially in view of other countries not having the same screening procedure for airline passengers.<p>I've summed up my reaction to the past incidents of terrorism directed at Americans overseas or civilians in the United States in a more recent Hacker News comment: ""It's important for all of us to remember the basic issue here. The basic issue is whether people in free countries, like most readers of Hacker News, are going to be able to enjoy the right of free speech throughout their country, on any subject, or whether any American or Dutch person or other person accustomed to free speech who happens to be within reach of attack by a crazy foreign person has to prepare for war just to continue to exercise free speech. On my part, I'm going to continue to comment on public policy based on verifiable facts and reason and logic, even if that seems offensive. I am not going to shrink from saying that people in backward, poorly governed countries that could never have invented the Internet have no right to kill and destroy just because someone in a free country laughs or scorns at their delusions. The people who are destroying diplomatic buildings and killing diplomats are declining to use thoughtful discussion to show that they are anything other than blights on humankind.""<p>Allow me to reemphasize this point. The many participants on HN who criticize Transportation Security Agency ""security theater"" as a meaningless reduction in the freedom of people who travel to the United States are right on the basic point. If free citizens of free countries can't live in freedom because of fear of terrorists, the terrorists have already won. You and I should be able to speak our minds and express our opinions in the manner of all people in free countries--sometimes agreeing with one another, sometimes disagreeing, but always letting the other guy have his say. To engage in self-censorship because of fear of violent thugs is to be defeated by the thugs.<p>We should also be able to fly freely about the country with no more than strictly necessary security precautions. I want to be able to walk into an airport with my shoes on and walk calmly to an arrival gate to greet arriving passengers there. I used to do that. And I want to be able to carry a Swiss Army knife in an airline carry-on bag. Grandmothers and mothers and children should surely be able to board an airliner unmolested in a free country like the United States.<p>That said, I remember when conditions changed in the United States. I stood on top of the former World Trade Center in New York City twice while traveling with foreign visitors to the United States during my earlier frequent flyer days. Because I remember the peace and freedom I long enjoyed here to welcome visitors to the United States from around the world, I want the leaders and active participants in terrorist networks to identified through constant surveillance and intelligence, and I want terrorists to be attacked relentlessly where they live, so that they have to hide in caves while people all over the world who renounce their goals get to lead civilized, peaceful lives in the Twenty-First Century. Taliban delenda est. Al Qaeda delenda est.<p>AFTER EDIT: Thanks for the several interesting comments. I think it is important to acknowledge that, yes, the United States government as a matter of official policy has engaged in assassination of foreign government leaders, and plotted the assassination of others, as well as committed and plotted break-ins in foreign embassies (but not random bomb attacks on foreign embassies, to the best of my recollection). I think the United States has been chastened by some of the results of those earlier policies. The movie <i>Argo</i> has been watched by many Americans, and it frankly acknowledges the assassination of an elected prime minister in Iran by the CIA back before I was born. I think now the United States is much more interested in information openness as a means to make sure that countries all around the world trade peacefully rather than waging war one one another, and I think that is the only long-term way to defeat terrorist networks. The current armed warfare strategy of drone attacks on specific terrorist leaders rather than mass bombing attacks on cities (as in World War II) is a step forward in war-fighting effectiveness and an improvement in reducing civilian casualties.<p>Yes, the United States is still second only to France as a country destination for foreign tourists (and rather more of the tourists to France can drive cars or ride trains to France than can many visitors to the United States). So as obnoxious as current TSA security procedures are to me and to many, they are not so obnoxious that people have stopped visiting the United States for fun.<p>Oh, yes, and my ""half-Asian"" children look very Central Asian, as one might expect, and my oldest son with his full black beard looks like someone from the latest news story about Al Qaeda. I'm not sure what his experience has been traveling around the country for his study and work. He barely remembers the old days before the TSA. Certainly we should also make sure not to harass citizens or visitors who happen to have the wrong name or the wrong pattern of physical appearance, but identify threats on the basis of more relevant information. Another top-level comment in this thread says that Israel succeeds in doing that for the most part.",1360795339

Too often the work requires\nsome custom input data gathering and some custom\nsoftware writing.  Weeks or months of such work are\nnot welcome for some one-shot question.<p>(2) Algorithm Power.  Too often one wishes for an\nalgorithm that shows that P = NP with a polynomial\nof small degree with small coefficients.  Of course,\nthe question of P = NP? remains one of the grand\nchallenges in pure and applied mathematics.  Instead\nof such an algorithm, too often one must look for\nand exploit special problem structure, write some\ncustom, one-shot software, and struggle.  The people\npaying the bills don't like to see the struggle,\neven when it is successful.  More welcome is just to\npush a button, ""Optimize"" and get a best possible\nanswer.<p>(3) Uncertainty.  The OP is correct about the role\nof uncertainty:  E.g., the Dean of Engineering at\nMIT, Tom Magnanti, gave a Goldman Lecture at Johns\nHopkins on designing a large IP network, e.g., a big\nchunk of the Internet.  Yes, it's a big problem in\n'combinatorial' optimization as in, say,<p>George L. Nemhauser and Laurence A. Wolsey, 'Integer\nand Combinatorial Optimization', ISBN 0-471-35943-2,\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<p>Yes, these problems are apparently the original\nmotivations for the question of P versus NP.<p>At times companies have tried to attack this network\ndesign problem.  There was work in PLano, TX\nassociated with SMU, some early Bell Labs work, and\na Cisco effort to help with multi-protocol label\nswitching (MPLS).<p>Well, much of the real challenge of this network\ndesign problem is the uncertainty:  That is, we know\nthat the traffic and network capacity will be\ngrowing quickly and that we will have to continue to\nmake major changes in the physical network.  In\nprinciple if we had a probabilistic description of\nthe growth, then we could minimize expected\ndiscounted cost over time.  Alas, we don't have that\nprobabilistic description, and if we did mostly\nusing it would be too difficult for the algorithms\nand computing.<p>More generally for the real world I see three\nproblems, one need, and one solution:<p>Three Problems.<p>(1) Professionalism.  Such applied mathematics is a\ntechnical field in part trying to be useful in the\nreal economy.  There are other technical fields\ndoing this, but often they have a big advantage of\n'professionalism', that is, government licensing,\npeer review, official continuing education, code of\nethics, and liability.  The practice of applied\nmathematics has none of these and, thus, is taken\nmuch less seriously.<p>(2) Interface.  Large US organizations, one big\nenough to pay for such applied mathematics for their\ninternal use, are still organized much like Henry\nFord's factory floor 100 years ago where the\nsupervisor is supposed to know more and the\nsubordinate is supposed just to add routine effort\nto the work of the supervisor.<p>So, there is a severely awkward interface between a\nsubordinate working as an applied mathematician and\na supervisor who does not understand the applied\nmathematics.  And, unless the CEO and COB are such\nmathematicians, going up the management chain there\nmust always be such an awkward interface.<p>The in-house legal staff solves this problem with\nsome aspects of their professionalism that the\napplied mathematicians don't have.<p>Further, a norm in such a hierarchy is that the\nsupervisor's job is just to do what has been\nassigned by their superior; making some innovative\napplication of applied mathematics is not part of\nthe job description; and pursuing such a project and\nfailing could ruin the supervisor's career.<p>Also, no one had their career ruined from failing to\nmake an innovative application of applied\nmathematics.  And if a supervisor somehow does make\nsuch an innovative application, then every\nnon-mathematician up the management chain to the COB\ncan be afraid of their job.<p>Really, then, nearly only a secure CEO can sponsor a\nproject in applied mathematics that is serious for\nthe company, and only a small fraction of such CEOs\nwill want to put such a project on their calendar.<p>(3) Power.<p>In US business, the top few people have a lot of\npower, want to keep it, and don't want it\nchallenged.  To them a project in applied\nmathematics can be a nuisance to be swatted down\nlike a fly.<p>So how does computing solve the problems (1)-(3)?\nAwkwardly.  The best situation is that the company\nis just a computing company -- Microsoft, Adobe,\nIntuit, Google, Facebook, etc.  Otherwise usually\nthe computing is so important that the non-technical\npeople in the company struggle to work with the\ncomputing people.<p>The Need.<p>In broad terms, computing has often programmed what\npeople did before manually.  So, what was to be\nprogrammed was well understood.  Now that work is\nslowing, and for more progress computing will have\nto program work that never was done manually and,\nthus, is much less well understood.<p>Then there is a challenge:  Just in computing, as we\nmove away from what was understood manually, we are\nleft without means of knowing what the heck we are\ndoing.<p>Let's take an example, finding a spacecraft\ntrajectory to Saturn.  That was never done\nmanually.  So, how was it done?  Sure, with some\nmathematical physics, ordinary differential\nequations, and some numerical methods for those\nequations.  With that work done, the corresponding\nsoftware could begin.  We were quite sure that the\nsoftware, if written as specified by the physics and\nmath, would work.  So, it was the physics and math\nthat let us know what we were doing.<p>Then, sure, in part computer science has tried to\nmove into such applied math and, at times, the\nphysics.<p>Here's the need:  More progress in applying\ncomputers needs more use of math so that for good\nsolutions to more real problems, never solved well\nmanually, we can know what software to write and be\nmore sure the results will be good.  That is, the\nmath does the logical connection from the real\nquestion to the real answer, and the computing then\nimplements the data manipulations specified by the\nmath.<p>The Solution.<p>I believe that the solution for computing and\napplied math has been presenting itself via some\ngood examples.  The theme is, the CEO needs to be\none of the main technical guys.  So, the founders of\nIntel, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook were the main\ntechnical guys.  For applied mathematicians,\nconsider J. Simons at Renaissance Technologies and\nA. Viterbi at Qualcomm.<p>So, for both future applications of computing and\nfor careers of people studying technical fields\nwithout solid professional support, the path forward\nis for the technical person to be a company founder\ninstead of an employee with a stack of many\ndifferent business cards.<p>The opportunity is there, but don't expect the\ncurrently powerful non-technical guys to reach out\nwith a welcoming hand!<p>Final point:  For an entrepreneur with a valuable\napplication of some powerful mathematics and with\ncurrent attitudes in business, just let the\nmathematics be an advantage in getting a better\nsolution for the real problem but don't mention the\nmathematics and, instead, let everyone else just\nassume that all the technical work was just routine\nsoftware.",1360795217

The big issue here is the sheer amount of difference between the free plan and the lowest priced plan. In order to get people into your monthly billing cycle you must focus on getting them to take little steps. First get them to sign up. Then move them to a free plan. It doesn't matter if its profitable, just get them to overcome the barrier of taking out their credit card. Second step is to get them to upgrade their plan to a profitable one. This is much more easy because they are your customers. No need to pitch them the idea anymore. All you need to do is show them that the other plan meets their needs. You can also upgrade them for free for a limited time (say 3 months) to overcome the barrier of upgrading, and then start charging them at the upgraded pricing. This way they get to integrate into the new plan. They will feel the pain of downgrading, and will mostly decide to not do so. Third, you upsell additional services not included in plans. Use the same technique in the second step. Give them free trials, and start billing automatically once the trial is over. They can always cancel, but most won't bother or want because they have already been using the product for so long.<p>Realize that people will pay money in order to not lose something.

If you go back and read through the W3C mailing lists people really really hated Netscape (the by-far dominant web browser at the time, for which books on HTML would have sections dedicated to optimizing for and would even go as far as to say being Netscape-only was fine) for seemingly making up HTML as they went along (almost all of the stuff in HTML that is deprecated, including all of the markup that was for style and presentation only, were Netscape-only HTML extensions) and refusing to take up the charge of CSS. Microsoft was even occasionally described as the potential savior that would come in with a second implementation that paid attention to them (and in fact you then find a ton of praise on the list from Microsoft publishing open DTDs from IE).<p>Despite all of this, Netscape (a company whose business model at the time relied on selling web browsers and getting contracts with ISPs to bundle their software with subscriptions) managed to get Microsoft's hands slapped so hard by the justice department for having the gall to give away a web browser as part of an operating system (something we now all take for granted: no one complains that Apple pushes Safari with OS X, nor do nearly enough people scream loudly about the fact that alternative web browsers on iOS are only possible if you use Apple's rendering engine in a crippled mode, defeating the purpose, despite Apple having near-monopoly status on the mobile web) that Microsoft never quite got back the courage to keep moving forward given the new constraints they were under. Thankfully, in the process, Netscape still died, and from its ashes arose the idea that an open-source web browser would be interesting and viable, leading to the ecosystem we have today.",1360794676

If we keep the error and bias level below a certain threshold, it looks factual enough. I think this attitude that modern journalists have--that we're all equally biased, so just admit your bias up front and then we'll all figure it out on our own--is lazy and wasteful. It's lazy, because if they would simply make an effort at being unbiased they would find they can do it, and it's wasteful with my time, because now it's assumed that I'll go read a bunch of other biased sources and form my opinion. This means I need three times as much journalism, and I didn't want any to begin with. So I'd say, yes, it's a fact that reporting creates a new reality, but it doesn't have to do so with the kind of audacious intentionality that most modern news does. A small amount of unintentional change is a lot more manageable than flagrant, unnecessary meddling.<p>As for Gladwell, I really enjoy his essays.

Let that sink in for a moment. In an 8 player game of SupCom every player has an identical copy of the game state and follows an identical code path. Instead of transferring over per unit state information (position, health, etc) over the network only player input needs to be sent across the networks2. If all players have an identical game state and process the same input then their output state should also be identical.<p>In other words, if your game is a function, instead of computing the result of one iteration and transmitting the <i>state</i> between players, you just transmit the input and let each player calculate the following states in the same number of steps. If the game function doesn't include random variables, you end up with the same game between all players.<p>That's very useful not only for games, but pretty much any ""divide and conquer"" algorithm.",1360793442

There's really only two things you have to worry about when naming classes, variables, etc. That the name conveys properly what it's trying to represent, and also that it won't conflict with other names. A more minor point would be sticking to a naming convention (ie all_like_this or allLikeThis). Variables are the easiest, since they represent something specific at all times, even if the value changes (something like position.x for a sprite). Functions while harder, are still (if you're not overpacking functionality) a concrete input and output. Data goes in, data comes out, the name should describe what that processing is going on within (such as forierTransform). Classes are a lot like variables, they represent specific things no matter how they are changing inside (if your class is capable of representing a giraffe or an elephant for instance, then a broader Animal or Mammal title would apply better.)

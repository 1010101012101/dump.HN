557240,comment,556687,556687,0,0,10ren,,,"I think there are strong parallels between PhD research and invention (though most startups these days don't have that basis). A patent requires researching prior art (literature) and describing your idea formally (papers/thesis). A PhD must be original and substantial (novel and non-obvious). In both cases, you are need to obtain your examiner's approval. :-)<p>In other words, formally describing a new abstract idea in the context of what has gone before is common to both - but actually creating a working technology, that people want, is different from a PhD.<p>That said, the beginning part of a PhD is <i>great fun</i>.",1239424914

Although that is most effective when you are researching a narrow subject and it does sometimes require you too pay too have access too the journals, something which my university provides.<p>Lastly there are quite a lot of recorded univerity lectures published online that cover just about any subject you'd want to study from the comfort of your computer. I'm verry happy google has made an effort to gather them at: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/edu</a> recently altough there's other places.

It's faster to setup and start tracking something, as all you have to do is send us a tweet.  This might work especially well for stuff you just want to track for a couple days, when setting up a bunch of search feeds is overkill.<p>2. A lot of people still don't use RSS, but use Twitter.<p>3. I tend to only check my RSS once a day or even every other day, while I'm likely to be on Twitter all day, so I'll see stuff more quickly than I will with RSS.<p>This is just off the top of my head...as I said, this is an experiment for us, so all feedback is useful :)",1239424257

In one year, they'd gain about $18,000.  If you set the fee lower, that's not too bad for a skilled worker.<p>problem is, the bigger issue with immigration is unskilled labor.  these people wouldn't be able to pay back loans for entrance fees, and its there that most of the issues with enforcement arise.<p>maybe this would work, but it seems like its solving only a small part of the problem",1239423310

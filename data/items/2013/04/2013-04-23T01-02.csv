5592902,comment,5592371,5592371,13,0,bane,,,"A few anecdotes:<p>1) A few weeks ago, a 15 year old girl in my neighborhood, learning to drive on a slow side road <i>with her parent in the car</i>, mistook the gas for the break while practicing backing up and ran over three young children putting them in critical condition.<p>2) A relative of mine was given a new big ""safe"" vehicle for her 16th birthday. The photos from the event were full of incredible excited smiles.<p>Three months later, while leaving her part-time ""earn your own gas money"" job, she met a ""cute guy"" friend of hers from school who wanted to bum a ride. Foolishly she agreed, on the way to her vehicle, two of her ""cute guy""'s friends suddenly showed up asking if they too could bum a ride.<p>Peer pressure and hormones fully kicked in, they all loaded into the vehicle and started on their way.<p>On a clear evening, doing about 40 on a paved road with no other traffic, she veered off the road surface, over-corrected getting back on, cut sideways across the road into a field and hit a tree straight on.<p>She was killed instantly, one of the boys is paralyzed from the neck down and the other two spent a bit of time in critical condition in the hospital.<p>3) After that happened I thought back to when I was a 16 year old, with a used beater car and what kind of stupid stupid driving I did back then. It was a miracle I survived almost any time I got behind the wheel.<p>This was even considering that, growing up in a rural area, my parents taught me to drive on the back roads when I was about 11 (in case of an emergency). They had me practice regular driving up until I got my actual license. Even after almost 5 years of sporadic driving lessons, including a minor fender bender in my parent's driveway. Despite passing the driving exam on my first shot with no practice and no studying, I still drove like a damn fool. (and in my state at the time we had to have something like 20 hours of professionally supervised behind the wheel instruction and 20 hours of classroom before being allowed to take the test).<p>It wasn't until I hit about 20 that I started to drive like a person concerned at all with preserving my lifespan.<p>Younger American's <i>shouldn't</i> drive. We should get a learners at 18, be required to have a fully licensed person over 25 (or better yet a parental unit) in the car with us until 19, then no passengers at all till we get a real license at 21. It's not just familiarity with alcohol or any of that, young people are just simply not yet fully wired to deal with complex social pressures, impulse control or any of the other kinds of ""maturity issues"" needed to operate a 2 ton block of iron that can be coaxed to 100mph in under 30 seconds.",1366682271

There is another large obstacle: acquiring subscribers to fund the production. Netflix already has a massive subscriber base.

Now all it needs to do is convince them to watch it.<p>EDIT: I think my post addresses filmgirlcw's point well. Yes, it took 15 years for HBO to cultivate their seal of approval. But that is partially because cultivating a seal of approval required HBO to build its subscription base, which takes time. Netflix already has its subscription base, so it only needs to convince that subscription base to watch its content. It can do that by 1) advertising prominently within Netflix (near zero cost), and 2) producing quality content, so that once people watch the first episode of a Netflix show, they want to watch the second. Therefore, the highest cost to Netflix is that of producing quality content. But as long as they can do that, they will succeed because they already have the audience. Of course, they do need to recognize that they only have a small window of opportunity to show that they can, in fact, produce quality content -- or else they will lose the willingness of their subscriber base to watch their originals.",1366681981

Early on, ""DOS isn't done until Lotus won't run.""  They pulled the same trick several times against competitors, for instance Microsoft Word took dominance with Windows 95 because there was a period of 9 months where WordPress was not available on the new OS while Microsoft Word was.<p>This was one of the issues in Novell's 2004 lawsuit against Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior.  The last I heard was an appeal filed late last year, see <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121123221716522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121123221716522</a> for details.  I do not think that the appeal has been decided yet.<p>There have been other, less nefarious, sources of breakage.  For instance at one point Microsoft changed malloc() to try to assign recently deallocated memory if possible.  The purpose is laudable - it is to push developers to notice and fix memory bugs.  However, it naturally caused many programs that had been working to quickly crash.  (Previously they would have run for much longer before crashing - long enough to be useful, but quickly enough to contribute to the perception that Microsoft software was buggy.)<p>Therefore Microsoft made a list of important programs that it knew would crash, and for those programs only gave them the old behavior.  Many small companies did not make the list, and the result is that their programs wouldn't run after that upgrade.<p>Microsoft's behavior here was defensible (in fact I like it), but it was a deliberate incompatibility.",1366681769

That scale is partially a product of capital, but also one of  point number 2:<p>Experience -- This one can't be underestimated. HBO first started toying around with original content and series in the early 1990s but it wasn't until Larry Sanders that the show really started to resonate beyond the periphery. Even then, the established TV world didn't start to pay serious attention to HBO until the late 1990s, when you had a swath of hits become bonafide cultural phenomenons (Sex and the City and The Sopranos were hits of a massive global scale beyond anything that cable, let alone premium cable, had seen up to that point).<p>Netflix has had to start from ground zero. They are essentially right now where HBO was in 1997, when HBO started to shift from acquiring content to paying for original content (Larry Sanders) to making the content in-house (Oz).<p>Now, granted the current world moves faster -- and Netflix is already potentially approaching the 1997 spot in just two and a half years with this strategy -- BUT content is also now more expensive (The Sopranos and Sex and the City were not $100m shows for a total of 26 episodes like House of Cards is), competition is fiercer than ever and the overall economics of television are not as advantageous as they once were.<p>I would also say that a third advantage is cable. Yes, cable is an advantage. Why? Because cable often serves as free (or nearly free) advertisements for HBO shows and the bundling of HBO for 3 months free or half-off or whatever is a huge driver in subscribers. Now, Netflix can replicate this, but they'll need to do it at a price and obviously they'll need to assess if giving the cable companies 30% of their monthly revenue is worth the advantages of being bundled.<p>None of this is insurmountable, but just as starting a movie studio from scratch is hard -- pivoting from a pure distributor into an original content creator/distributor is hard too.",1366681375

So it's not a grab-bag of random partials  it's the same folder structure an application would use for its regular views, but instead with a parent sync folder. ie, if a views/users/ directory contained ""_profile.html.erb"", you would move the sync partial to views/sync/users/. Having to run an additional process is the best case scenario right now unless we can get websockets into Rails/Ruby land, but I'm a believer that this approach is the best solution for current tooling suits the problem quite well. In regards to russian doll caching I'll have to take a look and verify what's going on under the hood, but sync will work fine with fragment caching outside and within a sync'd partial as long as the cache keys properly account for the resource/scope. When a model is updated on the server and `sync_update user` is called, Sync will render every partial to string in the views/sync/users directory, and dispatch a message to listeners on each channel for each partial. So the sync will only re-render what's contained in the sync'd partial. If you have fragment caches within your sync'd partial, they will only bust if their cache key has expired just like a normal render. Hopefully that helps.

They articles always then declare the difference in salaries to be the value of any college degree. These comparisons are absurd and statistically invalid.<p>People who drop out of high school are more likely to be mentally incapable of doing high paid engineering work than those who are also able to graduate from an engineering program. The people capable of graduating from an engineering program were capable before graduating. Those who are high school drop outs are more likely to be incapable.<p>There's a cool study (can't find the cite) where they looked at lifetime wages of people who were ACCEPTED to a given university and then compared those who actually went to college and graduated to those who decided not to go to college after being accepted. The lifetime wages were the same, showing that it was the selection process of getting admitted to college that was simply choosing for talent and not anything that college does to anyone. Those who benefit from burdening the next generation with massive education debt don't discuss this though and claim that it is not selecting for talent. To show that is the case, take people who are in that illiterate high school dropout category, send them to college, and then compare their lifetime salaries to the ones who were not illiterate. This study has not been done. Yes, I am aware there are hundreds of studies proving that college graduates make more than non-graduates, I am not contesting that there are such studies or that they are the majority of studies on this topic.<p>In any case regardless of whether you believe in the existence of the unnamed study I regret I can't name, I hope it is obvious that the set of people who are high school drop outs and the set of people who have graduated with an engineering degree are not randomly selected people differing only in if a machine called college molded them into a higher earning resource asset. Since they are not randomly selected people differing only if a engineering education has been applied to them as a black box function, it is not correct to assume that salary differences between the two are solely attributable to whether or not they have been run through this black box.",1366680810

If two objects have the same prototype they will have access to the same methods.<p>Now, unfortunately, the native Javascript way of saying ""please set the prototype of this object to X"" is not very intuitive.

And that $8 a month per household is probably half of what HBO is getting per household for its 29m subscribers (plus what they get from home video, licensing and international).<p>Netflix has pivoted from trying to be cable to trying to be HBO. That's all well and good but let's not try to spin this as how cord-cutting is ""winning."" It's not. If cord-cutting was winning, Netflix would have had more subscribers than HBO quarters ago. Instead, Netflix's next big strategy is to get bundled WITH cable providers (which incidentally is a smart approach and could be what really lets Netflix's subscriber base balloon).<p>HBO, Netflix and Showtime require original content to really push the needle. HBO has an advantage of having spent the last 20 years (since Larry Sanders, really) cultivating the best showrunners and writing talent that have in turn, brought in some of the best programming in the history of the medium.<p>Moreover, HBO has a financial advantage in that they make most of their original series in-house. Netflix does it two ways. They fund series outright like House of Cards and Arrested Development (but to be clear, 20th Century Fox still produced and owns the video and syndication rights to AD) or they acquire the first-run rights (Lillyhammer, Tom Fontana's Borgia). Even in the cases where they do fund the development, a secondary production company usually still does everything -- it's not in-house. HBO, by virtue of being a subsidiary (and the most profitable subsidiary) of Time Warner, has access to Warner Bros. Television, which cuts down on a lot ancillary costs before it comes time for distribution.<p>It'll be interesting to see if Netflix can afford to acquire or do full-contracts with certain production companies and creator shingles to get rights to future projects. Alan Ball has a longstanding deal with HBO and David Milch has a semi-exclusive with them too.<p>TL;DR This is great for Netflix, but all it really does is make them a real contender as a premium content network.

4061345,comment,4051699,4051699,1,0,vermasque,,,"First, I go through a light language overview:  fundamental concepts and syntax.  This gives me a feel language, whether or not I want to pursue it (I keep revisiting and abandoning Clojure), and what I can learn from it and apply to other development in other programming languages I already know.  For example, playing with programming languages with functional influences (Python, Scala) has influenced how I write Java code in my day job (more static functions, object composition over class inheritance, more re-use) even if I rarely touch those influential languages.  For examples of a light overview, take a look at anything on w3schools.com or take a look at <a href=""http://tour.golang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tour.golang.org</a> which I read recently.  I've taken notes before and it seems to provide very little value, especially if you have access to the light overview again.<p>Then you must build something to exercise that learning.  If you just read and don't build, it'll slip away just as quick as it came.  Solving an actual problem that you have is a good motivator for building something.  Recreating something as you believe it should be is another one; for example, build your ideal word processor.  Complete learning involves building things of significant complexity.<p>I would learn complementary languages to diversify skills.  If you know C#.NET, time spent also learning Java is not necessarily that beneficial.  They are similar.  However, learning Bash for shell programming is at a different level of abstraction and is optimal for tasks that the aforementioned languages are not.",1338746202

I understand the need to weed out applicants that lack skills.  This can and should be done by technical screening conducted by qualified individuals.<p>FWIW this opinion is based on experience. I've conducted more interviews than I have given. As an applicant I once went through a fairly lengthy interview process that first did a screening interviews including live coding exercises. They were conducted and critiqued in real time.  I have no issue with these.  You can either do what you say, or you can't and it becomes apparent fast.<p>The next stage is where I started to question the company's processes - They requested a small ""project"" followed by an interview.  I _nearly_ pulled the plug on this, since it was a request for 10+ hours coding, but did it anyway.<p>The next interview involved a fairly in depth defense of my code and design choices, white board work that again put my skill set to the test real time. After several hours of this, I was requested to do another ""small project"" and I walked away.<p>TL;DR  Ask me a million questions, put my skills to the test on the spot, but don't ask free work...

I will take a similar example but in a classroom.<p>Say students in a classroom take a test scored from 0 (worst) to 20 (best). The result of the test is as follows: forty students get a 11 and ten gets a 1. That makes a mean of (11x40+10)/50 => 9. Hence all forty students are above average. If we plot the number of people per mark this gives a very special (and artificial) distribution since we made it up to make the point that it is possible for most people to be above average. In more realistic scenarios and unless skewed by external factors (bad test, wrong population, cheating) the distribution is often close to being normal, i.e mean and median are approximately the same (hence it's an impossibility to have 80% of people above mean).<p>Yet what's really interesting in Dunning-Kruger tests is not the <i>actual results of the tests</i>, it is the <i>comparison</i> between one's own assessment and real results, which actually abstracts from distribution problems and 'average' discussions, since each one person is compared to oneself.

Of course, this philosophy fit within the nature of the jury system itself, by which parties could only elect a jury trial in cases ""triable by jury"" as prescribed by the U.S. Constitution and the implementing rules of civil procedure. If claims were triable by jury, and if a party elected to have them tried by a jury, this right had to be preserved at all costs and it was regarded as inappropriate for a judge to be too aggressive in attempting to screen and bounce claims at any part of the pretrial stage or to use too much authority at the trial itself to limit the scope of assertable claims. Judges from this school of thought typically had been trial lawyers themselves, often having honed their skills in a context (e.g., personal injury) where legal technicalities mattered less than the big issue of how a jury might find the facts at a trial.<p>The minimalist philosophy had worked well in a day when claims were few and limited in a typical civil case. In the modern commercial era, though, and especially in the federal courts, this approach of letting the parties run wild leads to many problems of case management and opens up the door to abuse for aggressive litigants who throw power and money around freely as a means of enlarging the settlement value of their cases. Thus, the judge for whom I had clerked (who, by the way, was a superb and much respected judge in his own right, having been many years ago the Chief Judge of the Northern District of California, the same district in which Judge Alsup sits), would have some 400 active civil cases on average at any given time while those who applied active case management were typically down in the low 200's. Parties would have <i>huge</i> delays in having a trial date assigned to their cases because so many others were in line before them. And trials themselves could run for weeks and months just because no check was placed on the lawyers throwing out everything they could to see what might stick in front of a jury.<p>Judge Alsup, in contrast, applied very strong case management skills to this case: (1) he forced Oracle to pick its strongest patent claims and to forego the rest (in theory, he had no power to do this but he effectively managed it by telling Oracle that, if it did not trim its claims, he just might exercise his powers to stay the entire litigation until the whole lot of them got full patent reexaminations before the USPTO); (2) he gave the parties very strict time limits within which to put on their evidence; (3) he set out strict rules for discovery and then enforced them; (4) he was ultra-aggressive in knocking out wild expert claims by which Oracle had sought to inflate its alleged damages into the billions and put Oracle's expert through multiple cycles that amounted to telling him, ""OK, now come back with something credible before I will let it into evidence in my court;"" and (5) he brilliantly handled the tricky copyright issue relating to APIs and ""structure, sequence, and organization,"" which, being a very knotty legal issue in light of Ninth Circuit precedents, he allowed to go before the jury on the assumption that it could find infringement on the issue even as he reserved the ultimate authority to decide the issue regardless of what the jury concluded (the article here calls this a ""feint"" but, in reality, it is just smart case management in giving the court of appeals the full range of options on what to do with the case if it ultimately reversed his ruling).<p>The case management aspects are the ""under the hood"" part of the case. Very few observers besides the insiders focus on it. It was, however, vital to the ultimate outcome. Just imagine if Oracle would have gone to trial with dozens of claims and if they all got tossed to the jury for ultimate determination, including the ultimate decision on whether APIs were copyrightable. That methodology - which could respectably have been applied to this case by a federal judge - would have given Oracle an open ticket to abuse and game the system and would <i>significantly</i> have enlarged its prospects for success in sticking a gun into the side of Google. The biggest downside, though, for the rest of us would have been in the resulting uncertainty on how such claims would be resolved in the future. Imagine how the developer community would fare in a lottery system where every API-related claim imaginable were tossed to a jury with prospects for a crap-shoot outcome. If that is a horrific thought, then you have one more thing for which to thank Judge Alsup. Smart case management, a smart judge, and a superb outcome. Be thankful this landed the way it did. It could easily have been very different.",1338745113

In many aspects it can be mechanically more difficult to deal with SQL UDFs but that is a usability weakness that just needs some more treatment rather than anything particularly fundamental, I feel.<p>There are three common reasons I write UDFs:<p>* The SQL type system and dependency tracking are deemed helpful.  This applies only to 'LANGUAGE SQL' functions, which are just regular queries.  Unlike dynamically generated SQL from the application, type checks and dependency tracking on other SQL objects can be employed.  This is hard to address in any tooling without having a complete copy of the catalogs (and many databases are not as self-hosted complete as Postgres' catalogs, so sometimes that may not be enough...) and semantic analyzer.<p>* Diverse language and/or library access.  If there is a series of obscure rules to hold simple invariants locked into exactly one application's libraries, it makes it pretty much impossible to use any other library.  This can be addressed, but it's often expensive to do so.<p>* Performance, in rare cases where network round trip dominates execution time and I need more than one plain SQL statement; this is only the case for the integrated 'procedural' languages.

All of the methods presume some model of the problem, and some of those models are more flexible than others. When a model is more flexible, it allows solutions to take on more shapes and must burn more of its training data choosing among those shapes. Models that are more biased toward a particular shape, on the other hand, can use more of their data for convergence and so converge more rapidly.<p>Which method is best depends on what you know about the problem. Does its optimal solution look a certain way? change over time? and so on. If youre willing to bet on your answers to those questions, you can choose a method thats biased toward your answers, and youll converge more rapidly on a solution. The risk, however, is that youll bet wrong and converge on a poor solution (because your biases rule out better solutions).<p>If youre not willing to bet on your answers, you can choose a method that will place bets for you based on what it sees in the data.

It depends a lot on where you want to adjust the slider. Which depends on your knowledge, aversion to risk, and expected payoffs.<p>In life, sometimes one size does not fit all. If youre going to test one shoe size against another, make sure you know which foot will end up wearing the winner. Likewise, if youre going to compare algorithms for solving the multi-arm-bandit problem, make sure know the particulars of the problem <i>you</i> need to solve.",1338744060

Other times intellectual property may be more valuable. Many activities are important to most businesses, but some are more core to your business than others.

Multi-armed Bandit testing can be good, just as standard A/B testing can be good. But the factor which trumps all of these are the total costs of testing (and the return on investment to the business). One must consider the following before undertaking any of these testing methods:<p>1. Implementation Costs - How much time will it take to implement the testing code? Some tests are easier to implement than others.\n2. Maintenance Costs - How much time will it cost to maintain the test for the duration of the testing period? We've ignored this in the past only to realize on occasion that implementation introduces bugs which incur cost and can be disruptive.\n3. Opportunity Costs - What is the cost of doing the test versus not doing the test? Consider setup time, analysis, and final implementation.<p>After going through a few tests now, we have a pretty good sense for what the total cost to the business is. We don't really look at it as adopting one test method over the other, but instead rely upon the projected ROI to test this versus that, versus doing nothing.",1338743151

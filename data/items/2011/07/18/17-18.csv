The trick, as others have described, is getting your data into a usable format, choosing features, and experimenting to find the method that gives the best results. As far as I can tell, the Prediction API doesn't do much to make any of that easier.",1311011997

In the market in question you have to fight for dominance in each city individually having to attract both workers and customer.<p>Even if Zaarly and TaskRabbit launched in the UK tomorrow it would still take years for anyone to become established. And the fact is that both of them have only penetrated a handful of American cities at the moment, it would be crazy for them to pursue a tough international growth plan when they've barely penetrated their home market.<p>If you look at a history of two-sided market startups (job boards, classified listing, auctions, daily deals) what happens in most cases is that you end up with a large number of local players who end up merging or being acquired to form a global player.",1311011984

You get to interact a lot with people who have experience with those industries that have long been important in New York: television, movies, publishing, travel, sports, news, fashion, dance, design, architecture, music and the various other arts. If those fields interest you, and especially if you have an idea that combines tech with some aspect of one of those fields, then I think the New York tech scene can be highly enticing. As it happens, ideas about re-inventing publishing interest me, so this is a great place for me to be. Even when I run into old-timers who hate the Internet and who wish publishing could have survived forever in its 1980s form, I enjoy the conversations we have, the different perspectives -- and it is, for me, surprising and important to be reminded how many people remain loyal to old notions of publishing, even as the business models melt away or are irreparably altered by the Internet.",1311011977

It has the most extensive dictionary (including many computer terms), more (quantity and quality) useful examples, it also has better features for jumping across dictionaries and makes it really easy to quickly look up other words in definitions, and finally, it has much better written Kanji recognition than the DS and phone.

For an open source project, any person opening a link will gain access without delay. For private projects, the viewer gains access immediately after acquiring the project owner's permission.<p>Cloud9 IDE incorporates HTML5, and supports Python, Ruby and PHP.

It's also pretty obvious that the tribes in power consider production to be far more important than anything else, where even self-expression and art are turned into commodities.

I would have to rent a textbook during the test, or arrange to borrow one from another student taking the same class at a different time. 3) Physical textbooks are really, really good at random-access. This has often been very useful when looking for constants without losing track of the pages equations are on.

2777078,comment,2776938,2776938,4,0,pmjordan,,,"The problem this solves is a serious one, in my experience, even though I find their choice of syntax rather curious. Given that JavaScript 1.7 introduces the <i>yield</i> keyword, it would make sense to add support for that to V8 and implement the infrastructure for concurrent asynchronous I/O around that as a library. The concurrency aspect is, after all, orthogonal to the blocking vs. callback situation, and can easily be done even when using callbacks, with a single callback function called upon completion of all concurrent I/O. I believe the Dojo framework provides such a utility, and I wrote my own simplistic stand-alone mini-library for exactly this a while back. [0]<p>I've run into the problem of endless chained callbacks in C, where it's much worse due to the lack of nested functions, let alone closures or garbage collection.[1] I ended up using the switch block ""coroutine"" hack [2] for the worst cases, along with dynamically allocated ""context"" structs to hold ""local"" variables. A proper macro system would have helped transform blocking code into CPS form. I tried to integrate a SC [3] pass into our build, which could have done it, but ran into all sorts of practical/yak shaving problems, so I ended up with the C preprocessor macro/switch solution for now. In user space, explicit stack-switching with something like <i>swapcontext()</i> is probably preferable, if you can get away with it, but in the kernel this is rather problematic.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/pmj/MultiAsync-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pmj/MultiAsync-js</a><p>The reason I wrote my own was because I originally needed it in Rhino, the JVM-based JS implementation, and I couldn't find anything similar that worked there.<p>[1] Yes, there are garbage collectors that work with C, but to my knowledge, none of them can be used in kernel modules.

Searching ""Voice over artist"" was useless though. Ok, now I've got a list of Twitter users that I want to put my request in front of. But  I can't reach them. I could follow each and hope for a follow-back. I could @mention each of them and ask. I can't DM them because they're not following me. Not very easy on Twitter.<p>I tried a search on Facebook. I can find pages for individual voiceover artists, but not a ""Freelance Voiceover artists of the world unite"" page that I was hoping for. So now I can message each artist individually or like each of their pages and write on the wall of their page. Not very easy on Facebook.<p>I tried repeating their Google+ search. Not only do I get a list of voiceover artists on Google+, which I can add to a circle and message (though they'll have to add me to a circle or check their Incoming to see it), but there's a ""VoiceActors onGPlus"" Google+ profile already that 105 people have added to their circles.<p>Unless I'm missing some Twitter or Facebook tricks, Google+ clearly wins that contest and I don't think it's just because it's new and people are checking it, though that certainly helped in this case.",1311008682

It creates a lot of potential targets for the mother of all patent lawsuits (IIRC, the community promise only covers the ECMA standard). Don't forget that, when Microsoft exits a market, it still owns a lot of patents in that space and can thus act like an NPE.<p>> they will discover that Mono is inferior to ""real"" .Net.<p>OTOH, it runs on far superior OSs ;-)",1311008660

And I think they demonstrated those incentives (or at least attempted to) with Buzz and Wave.<p>Google's policy of reciprocation struck me more as a way to open up the existing silos than as a data protectionism measure.<p>While I'm slightly concerned with how closed Google+ appears to be, I have hope that that's a temporary situation that will change as soon as they think they can execute well on the promise of open, interoperable social networks.",1311008645

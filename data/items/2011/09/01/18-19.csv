2951258,comment,2945689,2949637,1,0,ansy,,,"The deal may get blocked, but your argument and thinking are completely wrong.<p>Just like in any criminal or civil trial in the United States both sides can settle and the plaintiff (i.e. the DOJ) can drop the suit. Once the plaintiff drops the suit the trial is done. The judge and court are immediately removed from the equation.<p>Also, the DOJ just filed the suit. A lot of preparation needs to happen before a judge even decides if the court will hear the case. Much less actually go to trial and reach a decision.<p>While the trial moves forward AT&T will desperately try to reach a settlement with the DOJ to get them to drop the suit. Taking a case all the way to a judge or jury decision is the least desirable for both sides. It costs way more in legal fees, mountains more at this level, and the trial could drag on for months or years. Then there is the appeals process. Horrifyingly expensive and time consuming and in the end AT&T could still end up losing.<p>The DOJ has AT&T by the balls so if it wants something there's a good chance AT&T will agree to it now that the suit is in motion. And the only reason the DOJ got AT&T in this position is because it initiated this lawsuit. Without the lawsuit the DOJ had zero leverage. AT&T has enough skin in the game it might try to fight to the end, but it could be almost as bad as giving up and paying the fee if it won and twice as bad if it ended up losing.<p>What is interesting is that AT&T is saying the DOJ didn't ask for concessions before filing the suit. Or maybe it did and AT&T didn't think the negotiations were going this badly. Either way, the DOJ probably wants more than it thought it would get with or without more leverage.",1314903183

2951255,comment,2950671,2950671,1,0,bendmorris,,,"I disagree with this on so many levels.<p>""My biggest problem with celebrating the young age at which some people started programming is that it sends the wrong message. It says: 'Programming is so hard that in order to be good at it, you should've started when you were young.'""<p>In what way is this the ""wrong message?"" I think it's perfectly fair. Yes, programming (well) is difficult, and yes, starting at a young age will have more of a transformative effect on the way you think.<p>As the son of a computer programmer and a math professor, I was exposed to large amounts of math at a young age, and learned a little calculus before finishing elementary school. High school didn't have anything more advanced than calculus to teach me, so my peers (the math majors among them, at least) have more or less caught up to me in how much math they've been exposed to. But - in my opinion, at least, and maybe I'm just a narcissist - I'm fundamentally more of a quantitative thinker than they are.<p>""Were you programming non-trivial apps soon after you wrote your first line of code? Did you immediately proceed to program lots of apps, even complex ones, all by yourself, and collect payment for your work?""<p>Most people who start programming young make games, because that's what kids think computers are for. As a kid, I made scores of computer games. Games are complex and, when done well, independently developing games can be extremely stimulating. Before I turned 10 I was tackling things like I/O, creating intuitive user interfaces, sound, 2D graphics, and rudimentary AI. In each instance I had few resources and no training so I had to come up with ad hoc solutions myself. That I went through this process, and that I did it <i>young</i>, has been a huge benefit to me throughout the rest of my life.<p>And, side note: payment makes absolutely zero difference to your ability to do something well.<p>Disclaimer: I started when I was 7, so I may be biased.

I spent the majority of my time standing, but sometimes it's great to sit down.<p>I purchased a (relatively) inexpensive hand-cranked base from <a href=""http://www.kitchensource.com/table-bases/gb-1000-1001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kitchensource.com/table-bases/gb-1000-1001.htm</a>. I also got a cheap ($30) 48"" x 24"" x 2"" wooden tabletop which I was able to sand, finish, and easily mount to the base. I added a desk-mounted monitor arm (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IWOBGI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IWOBGI</a>). The price for all of this compares extremely favorably to most other adjustable desks I've found.<p>This setup has been a huge help for my back issues. If I were to try to quantify the cost of having a sore back that renders me unable to be active, it'd be vastly higher than what I payed for this setup. If I am offered a position where I need to go into an office, I would make offering me a similar setup a precondition of me accepting the offer.",1314902414

Make sure you set very specific milestones and a very concrete go-no-go milestone, so you fail as quick as possible.<p>I'm assuming you're a smart person who can make $100k+ in a real job.  If so, add a guarantee that you'll pay back the full borrowed amount within one-two years if you don't make the go-no-go milestone.  This option opens up more funding sources.  For example, an older relative with savings in the bank near retirement will need that money, but not for a few years.  If it were a typical investment scenario where the money was borrowed and if the company failed, the money was not repaid, that person could not invest because they need the money.<p>The other option is to get a loan from a local business development department.  I don't know what ON looks like, but most cities in the US have these types of BD programs that have a goal of creating jobs in the community.  Relatively easy to get, just have to jump through a few hurdles.  The requirement in my town is the ""get rejected by a traditional funding source.""  Haha...that's a pretty easy thing to do!<p>I would be very hesitant to receive any money from a professional investor at this point in your startup.  You'll have to give away too much of the company and you'll have a boss that has your balls in a vice for the rest of your time at the startup.<p>Wait for professional investment until your profitable and then it makes way more sense.<p>Keep us posted!",1314902126

I wanted to put an ad banner across the top (or bottom) of my Landscape app at all times. My app used UISplitViewController which must be full-screen at all times and must be the root view controller. AdBannerView must be in a UIViewController and must be visible at all times. I have no problem with AdBannerView being visible at all times and UISplitViewController taking up the rest of the screen at all times. But the requirements conflict and to overcome them, I tried tons of different hacks but nothing was stable or guaranteed to work.<p>I would have loved to use iAd in my iPad app but since it was not possible out of the box, I didn't bother trying to use it in production. What turned me away from iAd was not the difficulty in implementation but the realization that not ONE person at Apple thought ""hmm, how does one put AdBannerView in an app that uses UISplitViewController?""",1314901396

The best thing we can do is constantly remind ourselves of something that encourages us. I look to Frost's beautiful poem ""The Road Not Taken"", especially the ending stanza:<p><pre><code>  I shall be telling this with a sigh\n  Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n  Two roads diverged in a wood and I -\n  I took the one less traveled by,\n  And that has made all the difference.</code></pre>",1314900571

Without the composability, STM has no appeal.<p>Yes, you still don't want long-running transactions and you will seek to minimize them, but the entire point is that you <i>can</i> write an STM action that may cross a few modules coming from different authors and put a selection of such actions together, and one must only apply normal amounts of thought to such minimization instead of insane amounts of thought and effort.<p>It may be worth pointing out that I've made non-trivial use of the Haskell implementation. For Haskellers and Clojure programmers, STM isn't a pie-in-the-sky tech, it's a relatively straightforward library, because if you can manage effects or build it into your language very early (respectively), STM is almost boringly easy to implement. It's only hard (to the point of apparent impossibility) if you try to bodge it onto an existing imperative language.",1314900103

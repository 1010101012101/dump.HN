JavaScript, on it&#x27;s own, does not give you enough to write proper large-scale applications. You will have to commit to some framework, whether one your wrote yourself or one you got from somewhere else. And this isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> a JavaScript issue. Even better designed languages (Java, C++, C#) will require some sort of framework to augment their language constructs, in specific cases and when working with code of a certain size. Packages and classes are just not enough sometimes.<p>>I feel for people migrating from ExtJS to AngularJS for instance , it basically means rewriting all the code.<p>Then don&#x27;t do it. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having a code-base in ExtJS in a world in which Angular is popular. If ExtJS is doing its job and your software is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, why would you migrate to Angular? Why would you rewrite anything? Because Angular is more popular? So what?! You may have 100k lines of working, battle-tested code, 3 developers have been working on for several years. No sane person would just throw that away with a rewrite.",1390106371

I grew up a relatively poor, at times in the lower-middle class. I took a weird path to college and graduated very late. $750k doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge amount of money to me anymore, but perspectives change.<p>I did a thought experiment...had I graduated high school, went straight to college and graduated and decided to do a startup...at that point (22 year old me), how many steps out in my family would I have to go for their <i>entire net worths</i> could combine into $750,000 at that time.

That&#x27;s the entirety of their assets.<p>Having family who could pitch in that much runway without it bankrupting them is something I could never have conceived of at that age.

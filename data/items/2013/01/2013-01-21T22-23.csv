5094263,comment,5090717,5093895,7,0,sltkr,,,"> GNU sort is designed to sort on disk though. If you actually watch it working on a giant file, you'll see it generating lots and lots of files in /tmp containing the merge lists.<p>The number of files created is just an implementation detail; you could easily do everything in one file if you wanted to, or at most 2N files if you're not allowed to seek or overwrite files at all, and you want to do N-way merges.<p>Maybe GNU sort is just trying to avoid creating files larger than 2 GB (which is a problem on legacy file systems).<p>> Specifically here: sort is making up for the lack of memory by exploiting the comparatively (relative to virtual memory) fast streaming behavior of storage media.<p>Yes, also the fact that GNU sort can sort multi-terabyte files on 32-bit platforms, which otherwise wouldn't fit in memory. (Though systems with smaller process memory space than disk storage space are an oddity that will soon be outdated, I suppose.)<p>> I'm not at all sure a Haskell merge sort of the form used in GNU sort would do well at all<p>Well, even the on-disk sort starts by sorting chunks in-memory, which we have already established Haskell is bad at.  However, the merge sorting part of the algorithm may well be I/O bound in practice, in which case Haskell should be able to do it just fine.<p>The only good reason I can think of why C could be faster, is that if you can merge more efficiently, you can choose a higher value of N for your N-way merge,<p>> stateful filesystem I/O is also an area where Haskell tends to fall down<p>What do you mean by this? AFAIK Haskell can read/write files just fine through the I/O monad.",1358809125

5094243,comment,5091684,5091684,0,0,gfodor,,,"As someone who's been asleep at the switch with regards to responsive design I get the sense that it's, well, hard. Has anyone written about the ""responsive design vs forking the website for mobile"" tradeoff? If I were to start hacking together a site today I would probably just create two or three completely different layouts and DRY things up as much as I could in code, instead of trying to get the stars to align and get my browser to render the same assets correctly in all browsers.<p>In other words, responsive design seems to bring under the fold a use case that does not exist: physically resizing a browser window from a desktop size to a mobile size and having a page render correctly as you do it. Its a nice trick, but unless you assume the <i>same client</i> is going to need to see the content ""respond"" to changes in window size, then it seems prudent to take that use case off the list and simplify the implementation around the real use case: a client with a pre-defined browser window size hits a page and renders it, full stop. (with some small flexibility since users on desktop browsers do resize their window by some % occasionally) (Ie, if you focus on this case, simplest solution may be to fork it at render time in code where you have to and keep the CSS/etc straightforward.)",1358808774

The other reason is the vast functionality FastSpring provides as part of its full-service, all-in-one solution, enabling developers to skip the months or even years of dev work and instead focus on product dev and marketing.

5094237,comment,5073721,5074741,2,0,hosh,,,"Exactly. So what we are thrashing out with digital rights right now sets up for the kind of future when physical goods are more about the design licenses and rights to manufacture.<p>Thinking in those terms, we cannot actually discount the role that digital rights management plays. What makes DRM unfair and oppressive has a bit to do with who holds enforcement powers. If the seller also manages the DRM servers, then it holds all the power and can do whatever it wants. If the seller disappears, your access disappears.<p>One interesting around that is having a third-party rights management. Something like using Bitcoin contracts: <a href=""http://codinginmysleep.com/exotic-transaction-types-with-bitcoin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codinginmysleep.com/exotic-transaction-types-with-bit...</a><p>In their example, you would have bitcoin signed three way: a seller, a buyer, and a mutually-agreed-upon arbitrator. Two sides of a party can complete the transaction. If both seller and buyer agrees, then the bitcoin's ownership transfers over. If there is a disagreement, they can talk to the arbitrator.<p>The article also talks about other examples, for example, using technology like Bitcoin to sign a loan agreement on a car with the car as a collateral. As long as the owner is making payments for the length of the loan, the car is accessible. When the payments are in arrears, the car is not repossessed; it is locked out remotely. It will be unlocked automatically <i>by digital contract</i> when payment resumes. It also means you can digitally sign over the contract to someone else -- effectively, selling to someone else the rights to use the car if they can get the payments back up and running again.<p>Something like that would work with digital goods. I can say, hold a contract specified in a Bitcoin-like token to a book. I have the right to loan it out the book to any number of people, but I can only loan it out once. If I loan it, I register via the same p2p mechanism that such a person has the right to read it. When I want it back, I can get the book back, or have the access rights automatically expire.<p>It doesn't keep pirates from it. If you can read the book, you have access to the raw data, and you can pirate it. Like any social <i>agreements</i>, it depends on that <i>most</i> people will abide by this. It's an iteration on the kind of strong property laws that allows entrepreneurialism to flourish in America.<p>I can have something similar in a world of powerful microfabs. I purchase manufacturing rights of a design, and it is registered publicly via a p2p mechanism that is not controlled by any private interest. If I purchased the right to manufacturing 100 units, I can split it off and sell or transfer 50 manufacturing rights to someone else. If I wanted to make derivative work, I'd get a separate derivative works license, also registered via a p2p contract system.<p>Further, I would essentially be paying the designer the perceived value of the good, while decoupling that with the material cost to manufacture such a good. I can choose to purchase additional raw material to feed into the microfab, or I can choose to recycle something I want to get rid of, break it down into its component parts, and make this new thing that I want.<p>And if I didn't want to pay the perceived value, I find or develop an Open Source version.<p>Your comments about ""A new Carnegie in a global economy"" -- that is the premise for Neal Stephenson's <i>Diamond Age</i>. Personally, I think it is far more interesting <i>not</i> to control and be the sole supplier of the raw substance. Why do you want to control it? To be wealthy and powerful. Why do you want to be wealthy and powerful? <i>That</i> gets into some really interesting discussions.",1358808729

This is the bottom line for the article.<p>She doesn't at all say that perceived sexism is ""the problem,"" I think that is your interpolation. She does say that if the reason a woman doesn't join the industry is because she fears sexism will limit her, that woman is missing out (implied: it's worth it, it's not that limiting). But nothing is asserted about perceived sexism having primacy. So it doesn't necessarily follow from this position that the main issue is to remove the sexist reputation of the gaming industry. But even if it were, you will see a different approach if the reputation is accurate vs. if it is overblown.<p>There are lots of reasons for why a demographic might be under-represented in an industry, which do not require that the demographic is being abused to a point where there is no point in their getting equipped to join that industry",1358808370

5094158,comment,5093809,5093809,4,0,droithomme,,,"There's two separate claims in Atwood's essay that I don't agree with.<p>First, a lot of social networking involvement is a waste of time and is emotionally exhausting. A lot of times it can be highly addictive and participation becomes dysfunctional. People quit communities all the time when they recognize that things are just not working out. There is nothing wrong with that and it's a good thing. When other members feel they have to defend the community to the point of attacking others just for leaving, using divisive and derogatory terms such as ""ragequitting"", then it is no longer a community or social board, but is a cult. Cults defame members who leave simply because they have left, which is perceived as an act of betrayal and heresy. Communities do not.<p>Second, Aaron didn't quit anything. He picked a meaningful date to end his life. Aaron was highly rational and carefully thought things through, it's clear in his writings. He knew he could have handled six months or 7 years in prison. This was an act of self-immolation, the ultimate protest of injustice. It is a time honored and effective last resort message used only in extreme situations of injustice, which is certainly the case of the judicial system in the US which has in recent years descended into a police state like system interested in power and control but not justice. Self-immolators almost never leave suicide notes. There is no need to since it is obvious to all why they have committed their protest. This is clear here, just looking around people are upset and they know and understand exactly why he did this and it has to do with the Federal Prosecutor, not a chemical imbalance in his brain. No one in Tunisia was talking about chemical imbalances in Mohammed Bouazizi's brain, it was obvious that his act was a protest as well.<p>Additionally, regarding depression, Aaron wrote he was glad he had insurance to allow him to see someone, and his family has stated Aaron has never been diagnosed with depression and was not depressed. Those claiming his action was because of suicidal depression have only weak circumstantial support for their case based on blog entries, and have to completely ignore all the circumstances of what was going on. Blogging that you sometimes feel depressed is not evidence of mental illness. Seeing a therapist is not evidence of mental illness. Occasional depression itself is not evidence of mental illness. It is a normal part of the human condition. Remote medical diagnosis here by the general public is similar to the remote lawyering in the commonly made but unproven claims that he did anything at all criminal other than misdemeanor trespassing. An indictment is not a conviction. Violations of terms of service do not rise to the level of criminality according to the Drew appeal decision, so the whole basis of the case is very questionable.",1358807780

5094132,comment,5090717,5093825,3,0,tikhonj,,,"The point is that you use a <i>single</i> function for <i>any</i> type. So in Python you'd have to do int() or float() or customType()... In Haskell, all of these would be just `read'. The type system can figure out which instance to use for you, without having to specify it. Moreover, it's also trivial to write a function that works on <i>any</i> readable type, something hard (although not entirely impossible) to do in Python.<p>This makes it much easier to use: whenever you want to get any type from a string, you just read it. This is just like being able to print values of any type, except for parsing.<p>This can also be used with constants rather than functions. So maxBound is the maximum value for <i>any</i> bounded type. In Python, the closest you can get to that is something like float.maxBound. (Except, apparently, it's actually sys.float_info.max.)<p>As I mentioned, this also lets you define new numeric types that can still use the same literals. For my most recent project, I needed 18-bit words. I could do this and still write expressions like `x + 1` using the Word18 type. Moreover, it would be very easy to make my code generic over the exact type of number used--this would make it possible to use numbers of different sizes or even something more exotic like random variables. (It happens to be tricky because some of the semantics I was working with rely on having exactly 18 bits, but that's an issue with the domain and not with Haskell.)<p>In another language, I would either have to use the normal int type and make sure to always keep track of the overflow myself or I would have to wrap every literal in a function that turned into an 18-bit word.<p>So the special quality is being able to dispatch on the <i>return</i> type of an expression rather than on the types of the arguments. I think this is very special indeed and extremely useful. I hope this clarifies everything.",1358807490

Along the years I have received much criticism and help and am immensely grateful to the people who took the time out to answer every question I had, trivial and otherwise - and believe me, there were plenty of them. However the idea of constructive criticism on HN, and sadly, in the hacker community at large is ironically more political than logical. ""Criticism"" seems to be code for ""I'm smarter than you and I'll be damned if I don't make sure you know it."" The hostility towards, not just kids, but people's projects in general borders on the pathological and that's what needs to be addressed. I wholeheartedly agree that kids who are building fun projects do need that nudge and that encouragement to go deeper down the rabbit hole, however we should indeed distinguish between encouragement and patting on the back. The problem is the risk of creating a Hollywoood mentality (Hollywood may be the bastion of acting but really most people are more attracted to the prospects of fame than actual acting). We need to give them encouragement that lets them enjoy the process, not just massaging their egos, and moreover we need to get them to enjoy constructive criticism and see it not as ""boo-hoo they didn't like my stuff"" but as ""hmm I never thought about that.""

The Haskell community generate an unprecedented amount of bad science, setting out to draw the conclusion that Haskell is great and using every trick in the book to make that conclusion seem feasible. In many cases, it requires quite some effort to uncover the truth. For example, Saynte published results for ""naively"" parallelized ray tracers and concluded that Haskell was the easiest language to parallelize efficiently, requiring only a single line change. This deception was perpetrated by starting with a ""serial"" version that had already been extensively reworked in order to make it amenable to parallelization and then disabling optimizations only for the competitors (and even adding their compile times in one case!) in order to make Haskell appear competitive. Moreover, that reworking could only have been done on the basis of extensive benchmarking and development. Even the academics publishing Haskell research are up to it. For example, in the recent paper Regular Shape-polymorphic parallel arrays Manuel Chakravarty et al. artificially close the gap between Haskell and C by benchmarking only cache ignorant algorithms (that spend all of their time stalled on unnecessary cache misses), incorrectly states that such algorithms are ""widely used"", describes the one-line change required to parallelize the C code as ""considerable additional effort"" despite the fact that both the serial and parallel C solutions are substantially more concise than their Haskell counterparts, refused to provide me with their C code so that I could try to verify their findings (until I published this blog post, their code is now here) and cherry picked Haskell's highest performing results as a function of the number of threads (which peaks at an unpredictable number before seeing performance degradation). When I voiced my concerns, Don Stewart abused his moderator status on the forum by deleting my criticisms.

I think David Foster Wallace gives the most accurate comparison I've read, and I always want to show it to those lucky souls who have never had to deal with this type of depression:<p><i>The so-called psychotically depressed person who tries to kill herself doesnt do so out of quote hopelessness or any abstract conviction that lifes assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fires flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. Its not desiring the fall; its terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling Dont! and Hang on!, can understand the jump. Not really. Youd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.</i>",1358806224

5094025,comment,5086182,5087547,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"""Real"" and competent QA is darned hard to find.  I've worked with people practicing QA as a profession (in stable, big-corp environments) whom I wouldn't trust to sign off on a shipping product.<p>First, what you're describing is really more in the nature of QC (Quality Control).  Quality Assurance, when practiced well, has oversight over much more of the development process than simply testing what is ""thrown over the wall"".  This may, where people are clueful and budget allows, sitting in on requirements meetings.  It can also include the handoff to the customer -- whether internal or external.  QA doesn't manage the project, and it doesn't manage the product.  It pays attention, makes sure people are understanding each other, and makes sure that the result does what everyone needs it to.<p>Testing can be a significant portion of this.<p>Too often, with black box testers, I've seen them run through a set of fairly superficial tests and call things done.  It doesn't help when those tests are written before hand -- perhaps, due to lack of communication earlier in the development process -- with an incomplete, outdated, and/or simply wrong understanding of the product <i>and its environment</i>.<p>Many black box testings also don't pay much or any attention to what they consider -- if they observe them at all -- to be superfluous anomalies.  Something outside the written test parameters and description glitches, and they shrug their shoulders and move on.<p>Better testers look into those glitches -- and they are given the time, permission, and perhaps resources to do so.  Which is more important?  That the text in your dialog is spelled correctly, or that the application is borking your data one time out of thirty?<p>White box testing...  Well, there can be the predilection to write the tests too close to the code.  This can be somewhat akin to what can happen to testing, overall.  The testers have a (too) limited understanding of the application and environment.  When they sit down with the developers, the developers essentially tell them what to test and how.  The result is that the testing ends up very much carrying the perspective -- and limitations -- of the developers.  Developers are too important/expensive to do testing, so they ""dictate"" to the testers what and how to test.<p>Some good amount of a common perspective towards testers (""second tier staff"") may come from this.<p>In <i>good</i> white box testing, testers use their understanding of the code to better test edge cases, analyse potential bottlenecks, etc.  They may also be able to edit and recompile.  This can -- with sufficient understanding and caution -- enable them to more quickly, thoroughly, or at all execute test cases that would otherwise take much more effort, time, and the involvement of other staff.  They may also tweak the test environment in this goal (in a manner often not permitted -- for example, giving them some traditional devops control over the environment).<p>White box testing isn't just about understanding the code.  It's about being able to control the environment to get into all the nooks and crannies that otherwise might be outside the bounds of patience and/or the time and resources available to the project.<p>It should <i>not</i> be a... ""code review"", per se.  A style review and criticism.  QA is not <i>writing</i> the code.  They are analyzing its performance -- its resulting correctness.<p>Finding people who can really, competently do this latter is not easy.  And in addition to a smaller number of candidates and higher salary, it requires more in other resources from the organization.  Time for these people to become thoroughly familiar with the environment, and the project.  Respect from the rest of the development staff, and real and ongoing dialog.<p>It requires QA who are smart enough and knowledgeable enough to get up to speed without being a drain on other resources.  And who can understand the changes they make and correctly analyze whether they represent real concerns and also and particularly the real application and environment as they do and will or could exist.<p>(Could, both presently, or in the future.  What may be acceptable this month and year may cause problems down the line.  A project focus may not catch this, and a product focus may not catch this, but an environmental focus may.)<p>I've cleaned up enough garbage overlooked by the all too prevalent superficial, and/or just too poorly informed and under-resourced, testers, that I have little patience left for that kind of approach.",1358806161

In fact, I think I'm honestly really bad at 'pressuring' people in other teams to do things that our team needs. Everything comes with a cost, I guess.<p>> People outside the engineering department tend to be a lot more well-versed in making a case for priority and instinctively push more than the engineer pushes back.<p>I've also noticed that a lot of times, an individual sales/mktg/bizdev person actually <i>doesn't know</i> what the overall priorities are, since she is only aware of her customers and her items that need to be addressed. The person rarely has a sense for what the relative importance of her items are compared to those of the person sitting right next to her also asking the dev team for their time.<p>In a similar vein, I think it's very hard to push back as an engineer since she will rarely know all the projects that are going on concurrently, who the customers are, what the estimated revenues are for each project, etc. This is exactly the kind of information you need to fight against an interruption request: ""Sorry but I'm working on item X for customer Y, with deadline Z, which is a higher priority item compared to your item W.""<p>Now, an engineer probably shouldn't even have all this information, since the information is kind of a distraction in itself. So when a rogue customer-facing guy comes up to an engineer with a request, a much easier solution is to answer with, ""Sorry I don't have the authority to change what I'm working on. Can you please go talk to my engineering manager A or my project manager B? I'll be happy to change course once I get updated instructions from them. Thanks.""",1358805790

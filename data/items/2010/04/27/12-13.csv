1298042,comment,1297927,1297927,0,0,mdasen,,,"This seems to be the best buyer for Palm from my perspective.  HTC and others are currently selling popular Android devices and there's little sense for HTC to sell Android, Windows Mobile, and an HTC owned webOS to consumers.  RIM, on the other hand, could use Palm much like Apple used NeXT.  webOS could become the foundation of the next generation of BlackBerry devices.  It provides the same all-in-one experience that RIM does on a more modern platform.  They would just need to integrate it with the tools that business people buy BlackBerries for.  Combined with the BlackBerry name, it could go far.<p>Other manufacturers have already cast their lot with Android and it wouldn't make sense for them to offer both Android and webOS since they would have to keep pouring money into webOS development rather than getting mostly free Android development.  And, to be frank, consumers have shown that they prefer Android.  RIM is really the company whose weight could change that.  A ""BlackBerry"" webOS running with one of RIM's keyboards and integrating with their Enterprise Server could do well in terms of market-share.",1272372926

1298037,story,,,3,3,TallGuyShort,"Ask HN: Diplomacy Tips",,"Dear Abby (ha ha - I'm such a comedian),<p>I'm a programmer, and I recognize I don't have a very good mind for business. I was recently approached by an old friend of mine about participating in a startup. He already had a business plan, had several investors that were interested, and seemed to know his stuff - so we seemed like a good match to work together. I agreed to work without pay until there was more money, but I was promised 33% equity, maybe 30% since our most promising investor at the time wanted 10%. I began doing the site, but quickly informed them that I would need more details of what they wanted before I could go further, and that I really needed my role to be on paper - I was told that they trusted my ideas, and I should do what I think is best. Within a couple of weeks I found out that there was yet another 'partner', and my share was down to 20%, and even more frustrating - I kept being told conflicting things about what they wanted in the web-app, and being told that what I had done wasn't what they wanted. As politely as I could, informed them that I was happy to work with them, but would be unable to do any further work until my role was on paper, and my compensation/ownership was satisfactorily defined. I left it for a couple of weeks, understanding that they've been busy finishing school, etc... I was told that when this semester was over, we would sit down one day, incorporate, and I could ask for all the specifications I wanted. In the mean time, I specifically told them that until we had an agreement, the code was mine, and it would be wise for them to assume they had no code until I had specifications and owned something. I even sent them a contract and said if this is what you want, sign it, if not, I need to know what you want.<p>I got an email last night informing me that an incubator they applied to had asked for a demo, and they had said, ""Yes, we'll upload it!"" It's become apparent that 2 of the other partners have done absolutely nothing, no one has put anything paper other than my constant requests to do so, and they have ignored all my messages regarding what needs to happen before we can have a decent demo.<p>I realize I shouldn't have even worked this long, and I plan on absolute refusal to do anything until this is resolved, but any tips? I'd really like the project to go forward, if nothing else so I have my name on a really cool project with no NDA attached. But I no longer feel comfortable doing business with this group, however they don't seem to understand that if I leave, the code goes with me, no matter how bluntly I say it. Incidentally, they have no physical access to the code - my main problem is how to resolve this diplomatically, and how to do it in a way that the business might have a chance.",1272372784

1297972,comment,1297898,1297898,0,0,jamesbressi,,,"The points are kind of silly.  I'm not defending the iPad, only challenging the neglect on the writer's part to fully ""adopt"" what he has purchased or is reviewing and use it correctly. It's just a bit misleading to someone who may not own an iPad or iPhone or iPod Touch or something with a similar experience. His points are like saying, ""I bought a new Canon Rebel, but my Nikon lenses don't work.""  It reads like he is a shill (especially with a snide comment or so and references to XP, Microsoft, etc).  I will pick out 5 points below:<p>1. ""The iPad doesn't remember my Facebook password, so when I want to check Facebook I must reach for the netbook. A small thing you say -- but operating systems are collections of hundreds of small things, and new operating systems like the one in the iPad don't have them and old ones like XP do.""<p>A: Use the Facebook app...<p>2. ""I had pictures in my camera the other day. No way to get them up to Flickr through the iPad. If I had had the netbook with me, no problem. (I used my Droid instead.)""<p>A: Use a wifi sd card? Or, buy the adapter if you must use ""USB""<p>3. ""The netbook has a real keyboard. I'm writing this blog post on it. It's taken a couple of minutes so far. I'd still be on paragraph 2 if I had used the iPad. And I'd be entering it on one of my WordPress blogs because my customized content tools don't and will never run on Apple's new platform. (Unless they change their mind.)""<p>A: While I cannot stand the iPad's virtual keyboard, if you are going to do this task get the keyboard attachment. It's not what it was really meant for, but if you want to use it more like a netbook or laptop or desktop, get the keyboard. And, with the real estate of the iPad and the external keyboard, it is not adding that much more bulk to your travel bag if necessary.<p>4. ""I hate the font they chose for Safari. How do I change it? There does not appear to be a way to do that. That was a new feature in Windows in 1995. Or was it 1994?""<p>A: This is where it starts to sound ridiculous.  I understand his point, but what was the point in the third sentence? While totally ignoring how to use this properly, he then moves on to a point and opinion with a jab like this that make him seem somewhat of a shill.<p>5. ""Apple has a long way to go before the iPad is a useful tool. Lots of little things to fix and tweak, and a philosophy that's going to keep the really innovative stuff flowing elsewhere (where -- not determined yet).""<p>A: Maybe he has a long way to go before writing a proper and useful review?",1272371428

The neural structure has hierarchy: cells wire into microcircuits, which combine into mini-columns, which  combine into columns. These neocortical columns are more or less repeated across the surface of the cortex. The brain is not just a jumble of cells.<p>It's Markram's hypothesis that this is a tractable problem: understand each of the bits (ion channels, dendritic arbors, gene expression, etc.), understand how they're put together, run it through a massive supercomputer, and you've simulated a brain. Moreover, if you've done it right, that simulation should behave similarly to a biological brain. I think he's optimistic on the time scale, but I think he's within an order of magnitude and I agree his approach is sound.<p>3) Pretty much everything about the brain is an emergent property. As an example, the Blue Brain Project's neocortical column simulation shows alpha wave-like oscillations (private corresponence; but I believe Markram mentioned this in his TED lecture). Nowhere is there a cell ticking at 8-12Hz to create the waves. The oscillations emerge because the cells spontaneously synchronize at that frequency.<p>4) We can't define consciousness because it's an ill-posed question. Common definitions rest on the everyday experience of the 'ghost in the machine', when in reality that experience is an illusion of coherency created by our brains to help make sense of itself and the world. If there's one thing cognitive and neural science has shown over the past several decades, it's how small the domain of the unknowable consciousness is.<p>Take the work of Gazzaniga, 1998, on split brain patients, as described in the book <i>Brain fiction</i> (page 154, starting from the top):<p><a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=_rkKxbevFZEC&lpg=PP1&ots=9gZT3BFmNq&dq=split%20brain%20confabulation&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=split%20brain%20confabulation&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.ca/books?id=_rkKxbevFZEC&lpg=PP1&#38...</a><p>Et cetera.",1272370459

Regardless of this, if creating intelligence out of silicon is where the research is heading, we would have to first prove that silicon is at least an equivalently suitable substrate for hosting a model of our carbon based brain as opposed to merely assuming that whatever brain model we create can exist on any substrate.<p>I think more progress will be made in the meantime towards enhancing existing intelligence as it will be more immediately accessible in many cases.",1272369908

Don't be surprised when pacman pulls in a new kernel without noticing, your machine fails to boot because it has nuked all of your old kernel modules.\nWhile I agree that the rolling release model is attractive, it requires a much more robust package management system to be practical for people who do not live on the bleeding edge 24/7.",1272369672

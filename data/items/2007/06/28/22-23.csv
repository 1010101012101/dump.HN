31492,comment,31467,31489,0,0,britman,,,"Well it is a fair point. 2 main drivers for me doing it this way are:<p>1. Learn to build on the facebook platform because I'm a geek and want to see how things work and are engineered.<p>2. Create an application that has a use for me.<p>I have no expectations of this applicaiton apart from learning how the facebook application eco system works and hopefully offering an application that will be of use to my friends and a few other facebook users.<p>I'm sure others with more time and resources will do what you describe and it will be interesting to see if they bring about a viable business with them.",1183069562

31485,comment,31190,31190,0,0,tx,,,"I've worked with famous people who wanted to ""do it again"". The reality is that most of them refuse to admit that luck played <i>some</i> role in their last (successful) venture. This made them very annoying to work with in practice.<p>Do not forget, however, that <i>""luck is when opportunity meets preparation""</i>, but I find it amusing that most tech celebs cincerely do not believe that they got a bit lucky in the first place and seem to think <i>very</i> highly of themselves. And asking kids to drop out of college because ""they might buy a house for cash"" proves (IMO) that Max is probably falls into this category.<p>This is why it is very rare to see them ""do it again"". Seriously, how many can you name? Besides Jobs. <p>My point is that statistically most super-successful companies (PayPal, Google, Microsoft, EBay, YouTube, +hundreds more) were started by <i>smart and lucky amateurs</i>, this makes it less likely (statistically) for potential college dropouts to buy house for cash if they go with Max.",1183068367

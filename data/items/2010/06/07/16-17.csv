[1]<p>He exerted relentless pressure on the people reporting to him ( He tried to get me to go along but I was thankfully a peer [2] and not really subject to his fancies)   till they all had these ridiculous ""brand statements"" stuck to the sides of their cubicles. The best engineer in the group (he left the company soon after this)  had  a big picture of Two Face with ""Either you die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" written underneath. The manager didn't understand what that meant,(but was suitably impressed by the picture) and he showed off his ""initiative"" when some VP chaps came around [3] and in due time was promoted to ""Director"" for his ""team building"" skills.<p>The engineers all fall around laughing  if you mention ""personal brand"" to them, but hey they are still doing the same job wrestling with ancient horror codebases [4] and the manager fellow is now earning twice what he was for half the work so who is cleverer? :)<p>Nothing to do with the content of the posting really. Just something that came to mind when I read ""Personal Brand"".<p>[1] All kinds of management fads swept Intuit periodically. This kind of stuff was very normal there. A lot of nice people but very very ""corporate"".<p>[2] I was supposed to do technical ""architecture"" work , but had a ""manager"" in my title and was sufficiently high in the hierarchy (and boy does Intuit believe in hierarchy!) that I was this guy's peer. The cost of being so ""high"" was death by meeting. When I found myself in a ""meeting about a(forthcoming) meeting"" I knew it was time to quit.<p>[3] One  VP was a sharp fellow and he had a bemused expression on his face after seeing  the Two Face ""brand"" but he didn't say anything.<p>[4] Example 1: The code for QuickBooksOnline is <i>the</i> most terrible code I have seen in  my life. I had no idea you could write Java like that. I still have nightmares about it and it wasn't even something I was working on.<p>Example 2: There was this ""engineer""  who built a flash application to view a database table (not a database, a <i>table</i>). The app wasn't ""advanced"" enough to order the entries by primary key (or by anything else) so the team (of which this fellow was the ""lead engineer"")  would bring up the flash app and scroll desperately to find the right row for debugging etc. No one ever used a ""Select * from .."".<p>The creator of this abomination was given a spot award by his manager for  ""building useful tools to support the company technical strategy"" (which at that point of time boiled down to   something like ""flash frontends and cloud backends"").",1275929417

1410999,comment,1409721,1410774,0,0,rbanffy,,,"> Can't just quote out of context... there's a lot of other stuff around that quote...<p>I try to make quotes brief. It's always easy to go to the original message and acquire the context. A small quote serves as a pointer and should not be interpreted as the whole thing.<p>That said, the comment stands. It's not sane to demand people to choose between what's morally right (leaking the chopper video was right) and facing capital punishment. Others in his place would have leaked only the video and not other sensitive documents and could be charged with treason the same way as someone who leaks logistics to enemy operatives.<p>I agree the logic is tortured, but if you found yourself trapped in the middle of an unjust war (and this one is about as unjust as wars can possibly get) maybe the only sane alternative is to do your best to try to end it by the means you have. I agree not all the data he stole and leaked is at all relevant to the American people (the ones he swore to protect, I assume) and that they could cause lots of harm.<p>> In practice, there's millions  of moving pieces in the war, and some things like best practices for specific events can't be changed.<p>So, creating an impossible situation would possibly make the war impossible to fight effectively and, with some luck, end it sooner. Mind you - for the hypothetical tortured soul I imagined for this exercise, whatever causes the earliest return of the troops home is the winning scenario. Under this, it doesn't matter who wins the war, as long as it ends quickly.<p>Manning was reckless in both ways - leaking material he should not have leaked (along with material he really should) to people he should not trust (who is to vouch for every anonymous analyst at Wikileaks?) and then bragging to someone he should never, ever, under no circumstances, trust. I have a little, just a little, sympathy for him, for the helicopter video. I may have some more if the leaked diplomatic dispatches lead to some cleaning of foreign policy. I have no sympathy for indiscriminate release of information that may endanger personnel whose worst offense is a perhaps questionable career choice that led them to the worst possible place to be.<p>Exposing the dirty secrets of a dirty war is important. It may start with urinating on toilet seats, but it may as well pass through having pleasure when you take down a target and may as well as go all the way up to entering a war on known faulty intelligence.<p>If I had access to (for whatever reasons) sensitive information, I wouldn't tell my wife. I wouldn't tell my mother. I wouldn't write it down.<p>note: I did some minor edits<p>another note: I seriously doubt the Wikileaks folks have access to anything Really Bad Guys don't.",1275929149

I'm not sure you should spend the time to clean up and generalize your Goliath stuff. It may not be worth it.<p>But in the context of this post, it just came off as a little bit ""holier-than-thou"" to hear you say more-or-less: jeez everybody, what's your problem? We've solved this so why is it taking everyone else so long to catch up?<p>Now I believe you didn't mean it that way, but it seems like a helpful way to push things forward is to release bits and pieces of what you have, or at least write up a bit more detailed descriptions of the various pieces. That would be very helpful :)",1275926571

As soon as a good idea is seen as profitable, a bigger company with more resources (connections, time, money, employees) could come along and run with it.<p>Once companies got to a certain level, they could just sit there on their laurels and poach ideas from others.  Over time, this would result in less and less innovation and we would probably have a few big companies in each industry.",1275926453

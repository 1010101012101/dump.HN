If the costs of fighting terrorism outweigh the damage that a genuine terrorist group could inflict... who really wins?<p>As a US citizen, I don't doubt that <i>some</i> of our spending has directly stopped particular terrorist plots. However, my  point for the past ~10 years has been: they [terrorists] are tricking us into burning money chasing them around the world. If we had invested a fraction of this to take care of people who have suffered from non-terrorist causes we would result with a net benefit.[1]<p>I want to reiterate that there undoubtedly threats to be addressed, but sometime I wish that politicians (and a fair amount of the general population) would leave the whack-a-mole terrorism game alone, take their (our) coin home and find something better to do.<p>[1]\nAdmit, this is an assumption.

Dropping bombs and sending soldiers is MUCH easier than trying to tackle the very complex social problems that drive people to blow themselves up.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and claim that this attack is only the latest in a long bloody series of consequences of Partition.<p>The history of armed communal militancy, both Hindu and Muslim, began with the Kashmir movement in the late 80's; this itself was a side-effect of Partition. This was the first time communal tension took on a decidedly dark tone with armed militants entering the picture. Since then, things have only become worse, with the Pakistan establishment actively supporting and arming anti-India militants and Hindu nationalists in India attempting to derail any possibility of reconciliation by repeated acts of religious intolerance. The current situation vis-a-vis Mumbai is quite pathetic, with politicians falling over each other to get a quote out; and the people of Mumbai developing a horrible sense of resigned apathy, touted regularly as 'resilience'.<p>What is the solution? I don't know. (War, of course, is guaranteed to always be the wrong answer). A reasonable answer, as always, is economics. If the economies of both countries improve, the resulting improved education and decrease in poverty might provide a solution. India seems to be on the right track here; Pakistan, not so much.",1310932439

If there is 1 actual attack attempt per year, then your chance that a flight you are on is a target is only 1 in 36,500,000 or so. Then, of course, many such attacks apparently do not succeed if your one-per-year rate is accurate, and even a successful attack may not kill you, so your real odds of dying due to a terrorist attack on an aircraft are going to be lower.<p>Even someone who flies a few times per year probably has lifetime odds of dying due to such an attack of 1 in 1,000,000. In other words, you're more likely to be hit by an asteroid, drowned in a tsunami, blown up by a firework, or fatally attacked by a dog. Of course, you are also 50x more likely to die in a non-terrorism-related air accident, and 200x more likely still to die in a motor accident. (See, for example, <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/3780-odds-dying.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/3780-odds-dying.html</a>)<p>The one I find most amusing is when the advocates of the virtual strip search machines trot out the line about how statistically only a handful of people per year are likely to get cancer as a result of those machines who wouldn't otherwise have done so, while conveniently overlooking the fact that the odds of being killed in the hypothetical air-related terrorist attack they are ""protecting"" us from are even lower.<p>Basically, the reality is that terrorism is real but the threat it poses is insignificant compared to numerous much greater risks that we don't rewrite our lives for. The extra danger created directly by the ""improved security"" is probably at least as bad. The extra danger created indirectly, for example because more people choose to drive than to fly, is very much greater than the original threat.",1310932378

Non financial information, but most of the information we have about users they would never want other people to know or find out about.  Each day the average active user gives about 10-15 new bits of information (willing-fully, thats why they use our service, we are not just tracking users to get the information).<p>That being said, a lot of users when they close their account contact us and demand us to verify we have deleted all of our their information.  We do our best to anonymize by blanking out their name, location, email address, etc... in our database.  Then we mark the account no longer active.<p>However, we can never confirm their data is fully gone.  We can not retroactively go back and remove them from our countless number of backups.  We snapshot ever night and keep the backups for differing amount of time.

They have the time and resources to invest long-term in employees, and often have extensive explicit mentoring programs in place.  I suspect any of the major players will do, but I've heard Microsoft and Google have the best reputation for bringing interns and junior devs up to speed.  Facebook gives junior devs a lot of responsibility, but you really have to be a self-starter to succeed there, since the pace is such that there really isn't much time for focused mentoring.<p>When I was working at a startup, the lack of time for mentoring was one of the parts I hated most.  I joined initially because their chief architect literally wrote the book on Java (and wrote curses, and rogue, and worked on vi and BSD UNIX), but he ended up quitting between my internship and when I started full-time.  And the CEO offered to train me as a quant when I was hired, but time for such training never materialized because he was always busy with business stuff.",1310929573

(The python indentation rules are easily understood.) Haskell layout has been somewhat more difficult to understand (at least for me). I have been writing Haskell code and usually it works, but there have been problems due to failure to indent when I should'v, which were incredibly confusing to debug.<p>In python, it's hard to fuck it up: after a colon, you always newline and indent.",1229284422

397582,comment,397440,397483,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"I developed a relatively large web app with Python. Python's meaningful whitespace is the primary reason I no longer use python.<p>When one is working on a server, the editing tools are sometimes limited and they thus can make seeing the whitespace hard. In another, smaller, Python project, we had whitepace errors that appeared and disappeared like ghosts. Even if you have tools that make seeing everything easy now doesn't that you will have them later, on another system - especially, sooner or later spaces and tabs will get confused and be invisible.<p>I haven't programmed in C for years but the meaning of C programs is still obvious at a glance to me. After being away from python for a couple of years, the meaning of python program is opaque to due to the meaningful whitespace syntax. I know I could pick python up again if I tried but this indicates to me that python's syntax is not as natural as what Steve McConnell calls block structure. The end of a block is just as important to find as the start and so should be just as visible.<p>Writing one-line functions is, if anything, easier in Ruby than in Python.<p>Oh, and a syntax that requires as comments to show a normal program constructs is broken virtually by definition.<p>I can understand the appeal of the syntax. The syntax indeed appealed to me at one time and I enjoyed the rest of the language. But I think ultimately meaningful whitespace just does not work and will confined python to being a niche language.",1229283865

397570,comment,397343,397343,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A question to those here who have experienced both IT work in both the US and in India:<p>Over the past year, I conducted well over thirty technical phone screens in hope of finding a single, somewhat-skilled Java development contractor. The majority of those interviewed were Indian people who were working in the US on H1B visas.  Interview results ranged from the mediocre down to the abysmal.  The resumes of all these candidates claimed several years of work exclusively in Java, and many also purported to have had lead/architect roles.<p>My screening technique is an insult to a good developer.  I ask questions that anyone who has written any decent Java code should be able to answer without pause.  For example, I email a small snippet of code containing a try/catch block and ask the candidate to trace through the flow of program execution if the checked exception is thrown.  Literally half of candidates think that program execution terminates whenever a catch block is entered and the contents of that block done executing.  How could someone have written any quality code and not know this?  I'm not asking Java trivia.<p>What's going on here?  If I was going to travel half way around the world to work as a Java developer, I'd be sure to read a couple of Java books on the plane.  Is there something uniquely American/Western about expecting people to ""know their stuff""?  I'd attribute my observations to general, world-wide idiocy except that the rate of ineptitude relative to claimed experience was far worse with Indian candidates.  Perhaps a Mid-Western, Fortune 1000 company isn't a compelling place to spend six months on a contract?  The role was to do back-end engineering work on a pretty large, well-know site -- something I would think would be compelling compared to the average ""maintain a crappy legacy banking system"" gig.  If I claimed to be a Java developer and didn't know much Java, I'd be so embarrassed that I'd study every night to achieve competence.<p>I feel like such an Ugly American asking this question, but I can't discount my observations.  What am I missing?  Is there some selection bias in my data set that I'm unaware of?  I also find a general lack of creativity in these candidates, but I attribute that to the rote nature of Indian education (at least that's what I've read about most schooling in India).<p>Note: I'm not trying to start a ""Java sucks"" language war here...When looking at a candidate for the long term, I don't care if he/she knows Java at all.  However, when you claim to have done Java for five years and don't know basic stuff, I have to question if you know anything at all.",1229282794

It's too bad the student undertook it so close after 9/11... it would have probably been much better received, and perhaps even productized, today. I suspect he could tell a lot of large corporations things about their exposure that they didn't know.<p>On the topic of hosting, you don't say why you're not satisfied with the coasts, so I can't qualify my suggestions. Here are some unordered thoughts, perhaps they will send you the right direction:<p>1) Without doing a detailed analysis, I'd guess that Dallas is probably the best location to host a server outside of the Pacific/Eastern timezones. There are some very large colo centers (the infomart, <a href=""http://www.infomartusa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infomartusa.com/</a> comes to mind) that resell space to large carriers/providers. Many providers peer with each other in these spaces, which is the internet equivalent of being at an intersection. Even if you don't colo at one of these centers ($$$) you're bound to reap the benefits from this, as your traffic will likely end up backhauled to a place like this anyway.<p>2) If you're talking about a decent amount of capacity (more than a couple rack-U or more than about a T1 of bandwidth) call a couple carriers and ask for maps. Sales often has maps / diagrams that are a little more detailed than the stuff you can find on carrier sites, and they'll generally be happy to give you some suggestions for spaces in the area that are served by their products (i.e. where they terminate).<p>3) Unless you're solving for a specific problem the variability of individual colo providers generally outweighs the differences in locations. That is to say, you'd be better served by a well run provider in your home city than a bunch of imbeciles 5ms from a PAIX peering point.

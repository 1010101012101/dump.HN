From what I've read about it, it sounds like the setup on the servers had some issues that made the queue time issue into a problem where it wouldn't necessarily be for another, or even most other, customers. If you are or want to be, known as a technical company, that means you have to take responsibility for your mistakes, even if your mistake was thinking that the vendor was going to catch and fix all the mistakes and bugs in the service that they are providing to you. 
Building web services that are performant, stable and economical is hard work; you can't take your eye off the ball, and you can't just blindly hope that vendors will take care of your shit for you, you have to know what you're buying, and what you should be getting.<p>And, if you're going to go public with your complaints, it's best to do so in an understated, fact based manner. In this case, Rap Genius comes off like a guy screaming at the waiter in a fancy restaurant.

Do not try.<p>When the anger passes, the harsh light of reason prevails. Clearly, an inventor cannot succeed in disrupting large, powerful entities without friends. Innovation on it's own is naked, vulnerable, and weak.

5314769,comment,5314436,5314436,32,0,tikhonj,,,"One really cool thing is that you do not you do not need to stick to lists.  Many of these functions naturally generalize to other data types.<p>The simplest is map. It turns out that there are <i>a ton</i> of types that you can map a function over, and many of them are extremely useful. There are obvious examples like trees and arrays, but they don't even have to be containers. In Haskell, we call any type with a map function that behaves like the standard list function a <i>functor</i>. This is all a functor is--pretty simple.<p>The next interesting example is fold. We can also fold over non-list structures. In this case, the structures are usually containers like trees and arrays.In Haskell, this is what the Foldable class represents.<p>You can also think of zipping--in a very abstract sense of applying a multi-argument function to a bunch of structures--as generalized by applicative functors. However, lists by default form an applicative functor with pairwise application rather than zipping; there is a wrapper called ZipList that does a normal zip. Applicative functors also come up very often, not just for container types.<p>All these generalizations let you take all the powerful list functions you're familiar with and use them in new contexts. They also let you write more polymorphic code.<p>Interestingly, you can also generalize these functions in a different way--instead of taking a different structure, take a different function. This is where monads come in: you can generalize these functions over monads. In Haskell, the generalized versions are named by a trailing M: foldM, mapM and so on.<p>At a high level, this lets you customize how functions get applied. So you can have a fold that maintains internal state, propagates errors or even computes the result non-deterministically. The exact behavior is specified very declaratively by your choice of monad.<p>And, of course, as with any good abstractions, you can combine these. Particularly, you can take a foldable and use a bunch of the monadic functions on it. So you might end up using a non-deterministic fold on a tree. Just by itself, this seems exotic and hard to grasp. However, since it was built up step-by-step from familiar abstractions, it's actually easier to understand. Each step along the way is relatively simple and intuitive; you just have to put them together.<p>Now, what are the benefits to all this? The main one is that it gives your code more structure. A map a fold always behaves the same way for a given type where a for-loop could be doing anything. This makes it easier to read because you know the structure of the computation just from its name. It also makes the code easier to write since all the iteration logic is hidden away; you only have to write the function dealing with one ""step""which means you cannot accidentally mess up how the steps are combined (no more off-by-one errors) and you can't accidentally couple the computation itself with the iteration logic. They're guaranteed to be separate because one is encapsulated into the higher-order function.<p>In many ways this parallels the transition from goto to structured programming.<p>Another advantage is that it lets you write more generic, more polymorphic code. This sort of code is easier to write because the types are more restrictive.  There are simply less ways to mess up. Also, naturally, the code is more general, letting you reuse it in more places.",1362336959

On sober reflection, I don't buy this logic any more. Haskell's ability to be generic is really cool, so cool that it has a massive standard library of itemized, tried and tested bits of logic that can be used anywhere, and I do mean anywhere. All of which you as a new programmer are tasked with getting acquainted with. As a new programmer you must abstract your program out in a way that fits one or more these component pieces, that can fit the standard library. Ouch.<p>Of course, this library only gives you a toolbox to cover some fundamental logic, you can express really interesting things in short lines if you're skilled enough to abstract your problem out into general behaviour. Even I got this far, but when the problem your working on is best modelled through state, which is basically everything, you now have to understand monads.<p>What portion of the population do you think can utter these words confidently? ""I Understand Monads""<p>Haskell provides no ramp up, there is no learning curve.

5314668,comment,5313989,5313989,1,0,muraiki,,,"I know exactly how you feel! Every day I read HN and bookmark a ton of stuff, and I had been wondering how I'm going to go through it all. But what helped me the most were two things:<p>1) I explored around enough to find the particular technologies and problems that interest me. Basically I reflected upon all my bookmarks and tabs and though, ""this must be what I'm drawn to!""<p>2) Create a project to serve as the basis for learning. I had been spending a lot of time reading and evaluating possible things, but I hadn't really sat down and worked on a project. Not only does working on a project solidify your knowledge, you will be exposed to new techniques as you solve your problem which can lead you into other areas of interest. While you are adding more things to look at, you at least have a path where your knowledge is interconnected.<p>Here's how my own story has gone so far: I had taken the web development course on Udacity (it's in Python and you learn how to make a simple blog and wiki; I highly recommend it). But as I played around with things I realized that functional programing mapped really well to the way that I solve problems.<p>I sing byzantine chant, and realized that there's no standard and open file format to exchange notation in. I got something working decently, but then realized that at my current level it was a bit too big of a project for me! But my point is that you should examine your hobbies and interests outside of programming, because they could lead you to a particular avenue of inquiry.<p>Even if you don't ""complete"" your project, you will learn a lot in the process, and it will give you a path to follow through a network of technologies. And it also doesn't have to be something that nobody has made before; I also play sax, so maybe something to help learn scales might have been a more straightforward project. And if you get stuck on something that somebody else has already made, you can always hit up Github to see how someone else solved it. :)<p>While I put that project on hold, my friend came up with the idea to work on a poker visualization program. He's a professional programmer so he has been able to serve as a guide for me for things that I don't know much about, like algorithms and statistics. After a lot of hard work and with help from him I was able to get things working. The domain of the problem mapped well to functional programming, and his desire to have it run in a web browser led me to the right technologies (Clojurescript with C2 for visualization).

He was a traveling salesman in California, selling frozen foods when Birdseye just came out with the concept.<p>He gave mew a few shares of stock, I sold them for cash a few months later when I wanted to do something I just _had_ to do at the time.  He also gifted me with a Bicentennial Coin set, still in plastic.  It got spent, probably within the year.<p>He last gave me the life insurance policy, saying that when he set it up, it would require no payments.  It had changed to needing annual dues, so he suggested I cash it in.<p>I kept it.  Years later, after he had passed, my wife and I were trying to get our financial act together, and lo and behold - A whole life insurance policy has a cash value.  We borrowed against it and paid of the worst of the debt I owed when we met.  We paid it back.<p>It became the starting piece of our financial planning.  We had life insurance, then we built up 6 months of living expenses.<p>We bought our first piece of investment property to provide for our own retirement (I seriously don't expect there to be much of the Social Security I have been contributing to - matches your complaint about pensions, I think).

It's a multi-paradigm language making it easy to use it like a better c++11. However, idiomatic Scala is functional, and so you're pushed in another direction by the community (but, importantly, not forced). However, starting with a blank slate, then Haskell might be the easier language to learn.<p>But if we consider the resources to learn the language along with the language, then I think Scala dominates Haskell. Haskell was painful for me to learn because to become proficient I had to trudge through not only books but wikis, blogs, and code. There is nothing like Odersky's Scala book in Haskell. Learn you a Haskell, the Haskell wikibook, and Real World Haskell are all _terrible_ at preparing someone to become a proficient haskeller because while they show you the language they don't train you to think functionally.<p>In imperative languages you're giving a lot of sequential instructions to a robot.

I was 16 at the time. I came home from playing tennis and my dads car was replaced by my one of my moms friends. It wasnt very long after it happened. Initially I figured my dad was running late, not an unusual thing and I didnt think about my moms friend being there very much. When I walked in my house, I was a little shocked to see my moms friend there with her husband. I usually only saw the husband at the synagogue and such, but my mom and his wife were best friends. I walked by the husband, who was standing there with a look of shock on his face. My mom on the phone, My son just walked in I have to go. She sat me down and told me, someone came by the business tonight and shot dad in the head twice. My mom didnt know what to do, she stayed very strong, credit to her, scrabbled for a hot towel to lay on my forehead. I remember thinking that I have to remember these last sequence of events vividly because the rest of my life will never be the same. At this point it was around 7 at night and my older brother wouldnt be home from a concert until 11, at which point of course he would know what happened. He dropped to the floor when he walked in the house and that moment still hurts me. The eldest sibling, my sister, turned 21 2 days before and came home around 820 to a house packed with cars outside and people inside. I am 100% positive she was thinking it was a surprise birthday party for her. I couldnt listen when my mom had to tell her. Shes not all there mentally, my sister, so she doesnt function like the rest of us. For sure she wont ever recover from this. Never. Its still a mystery if any of us will.<p>I wanted to share a motivational story about shit. Quite literally poo. I grew up in an old factory town and my family owned a auto salvage business which my dad proudly ran for about 20 years. My dad had a super power than enabled him to work 7 days a week without a break on top of being severely ill with chrons disease. The guy had a hernia removed once (a year or so) and when the doctor came back to check on him he realized he removed a different hernia, not the one the surgery was intended for. My dad endured a lot of pain. He had a cyst centimeters from his tumor removed in 1999. Longest time he ever took off work. Still went back early though. Damn I miss my dad.<p>Every night when my dad would come home from work he would be filthy from working at the junkyard all day. Immediately he would strip down to his underwear and throw a bathrobe on and sit for dinner. All of his underwear, 100% of the time had shit on them. The chrons was vicious, and he was working too hard to let that stop him. I mean come on, this guy went to work every day despite being sick as shit and would come home beat to hell every single day. I had more than one person tell me my dad was a hard worker and one of the sheriffs at the trial commented that he had called my dad the hardest worker in the county. But thats the point; he had what it takes.<p>None of this was necessary, but we lived in a beautiful custom built home in a nice neighborhood. We werent rich by rich people standards, but when you grow up around poorer areas a little bit of money seems like a lot. And that little bit and some more my dad lost in the stock market before his life was taken from him. As well the business started to collapse immediately and even with my brother stepping in and my mom taking out loans the place just wasnt meant to run without my dad. Somehow my mom sold it and paid her bills. But I am left asking myself was it all worth it? From 16 until 26 I felt like my dad sorta wasted his life torturing himself by working all the time and not enjoying what life has to offer. It seemed to me like time is now even more limited and I gotta make the most of things by enjoying myself. But recently my perspective has changed. I recognized that my dad loved the grind. Everyday he went out there to stuff his socks with money to bring it home. It was his duty and he persevered through more shit than anyone can imagine.

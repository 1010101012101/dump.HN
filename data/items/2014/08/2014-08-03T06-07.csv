They changed the law on that some years ago.<p>The &#x27;free speech area&#x27; (Hong Lim Park) is just the only area where you can have a demonstration WITHOUT applying for a permit.<p>The normal anti-free speech laws applying (i.e. you&#x27;re not allowed to incite racial hatred in Hong Lim Park either), but you&#x27;re allowed to go there and demonstrate without a permit (with a few restrictions). IIRC, they held the pink dot rally there.<p>They had a protest against immigration somewhere up in the north east too. They allowed that to happen (protest application was clearly approved) even though they were protesting government policy and closely allied with the opposition parties.<p>These protest laws and their application aren&#x27;t really a whole lot different to what you see in the west these days.

Our local distributors have been spending lots of money installing new lines and upgrading the network, and the retailers are changing the meters because it means we get an accurate bill every month (rather than an estimate for two out of every three months) and they don&#x27;t need a meter reader to visit every property every three months.

I haven&#x27;t done a lot of Ruby but I imagine it&#x27;s nice as a day to day language. I enjoy Objective C&#x27;s message passing syntax and dynamic runtime so Ruby is likely a good fit for me.<p>Personally the reason to use Perl over Ruby is the community. I gel a lot better with the members of the Perl community I&#x27;ve met compared to when I was poking my head around Ruby. I don&#x27;t mean this in a bad/flamy way. No one was &quot;mean&quot; to me or anything. My brain is just damaged in the Perl kind of way rather than the Ruby kind of way.<p>Anyways, the actual question shouldn&#x27;t be why Ruby over Perl, rather it should be &quot;why don&#x27;t we have Moose (or something like it) in every language.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing about it that ties it to Perl. A dynamic runtime isn&#x27;t a bad thing to have but I can&#x27;t really see why most of the really nice parts couldn&#x27;t be implemented in other languages at compile time.<p>Simply put, Moose is awesome. You can build so much functionality with not a lot of code and it actually glues together well. Type coercions are awesome and super useful in day to day programming. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of API work where I need flexibility in terms of output (JSON, XML, RSS, etc) where a plain object dump to the specified format isn&#x27;t enough. In the case of the XML there is an XSD it needs to match against and the structure isn&#x27;t particularly amicable to sane JSON output.<p>Care of Roles, Type coercions, Attribute meta roles, and some preemptive thinking I basically just create objects with attributes and a few methods containing business logic and not a lick of serializer logic.<p><pre><code>  package My::Foo;\n\n  use MyCo::Moose; #Exports a few things I usually need like aliasing,\n  use My::Type::Exports qw(:all);\n\n  with &#x27;My::Role::AwesomeSerializer&#x27;;\n\n  has &#x27;some_attribute&#x27; => (\n    is          => &#x27;ro&#x27;,\n    isa         => MaybeSuperComplexObjectType,\n    coerce      => 1,\n    traits      => [&#x27;UseMyJsonSerializer&#x27;],\n    json_name   => &#x27;someAttribute&#x27;,\n    xml_name    => &#x27;My::SomeAttribute&#x27;,\n    alias       => &#x27;some_call_it_this&#x27;, \n  );\n\n  # yatta\n\n  __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable();\n\n  1;\n</code></pre>\nIn my types package I have various coerce methods that accept different data formats. The logic in the class doesn&#x27;t have to change, nor do I need to write a new constructor/factory like I would in other languages, when the data I&#x27;m being given changes in some non-trivial way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pacman.blog.br/blog/2014/02/07/moosex-a-new-ruby-dsl-for-object-oriented-programming-and-much-more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacman.blog.br/blog/2014/02/07/moosex-a-new-ruby-dsl-...</a>",1407048577

You can buy old refurbished analog/digital meters for cheap and measure what you want and it will consume no power nor will it send your confidential data (privacy). And you can combine it with a Arduino if you want the data on your computer. Many smart meters also send the data over a GPRS modem every 15min (have an inbuilt SIM card), that you cannot snoop so easy.<p>The whole smart meter movement is not about technical advancement, it&#x27;s about they want that you pay higher prices for consuming less and they don&#x27;t have to build a better power grid infrastructure in the next few years.

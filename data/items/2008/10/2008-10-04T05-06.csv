That being said, after looking at his portfolio, I was not impressed. Some of the logos he created did not seem memorable at all, had unnecessary detail, etc.<p>You can't just follow a set of rules to come up with a nice logo. You kind of need to have talent and an eye for colors, typography, etc.<p>Nevertheless, give him credit for listing out some helpful things to keep in mind for designing things.<p>The one thing I would say differently is that if you really like a certain logo's style, it isn't a crime to adopt similar styles for your own. All art is influenced by others in some way, and don't stick with something that sucks merely because it's 'original'.",1223097765

I've used both the Mac and the Windows version. The Windows version crashes regularly, and the Mac version racks up sizable memory leaks after a few days of use. They both use more disk and CPU resources than it seems like they should need, too. At least they aren't as bad as the Google Music desktop client, though.",1348696794

If you've ever seen actual Nokia marketing photos, e.g. for the N8 or the 808, they tend to be exactly what you asked for.

The only difference here is representation.<p>Those are two different resources (made plain within the context of my approach by the fact that they have two different URLs). Those resources are ordered collections. They contain the same totality of resources within them, but ordered collections are <i>not</i> semantically equal if the order is different. Therefore I argue those are two distinct collection resources. The fact that they both contain the same resources is irrelevant because the ordering is central to the identity of the resource here.<p>The URL is <i>not</i> the representation no matter how you look at it [1]. `/orders/groupByCustomer` identifies a resource which could, for example, give you an XML representation, a JSON representation, a PDF representation, etc., depending on content negotiation.<p>An API change which introduces different methods and data is fine. A resource returned under the new version will expose that, old versions won't see it. There's no reason why the resources <i>can't</i> be the same across versions, but maybe a request for v2 of Customer returns a zip code now and v1 doesn't. Still the same Customer and you have one URL for it.<p>As for a version-independent URI that points to the latest version (assuming no version in the header), the argument made elsewhere here is that it can break clients that use it when the API is changed.<p>> Header manipulation is much harder to deal with in practice and isn't easily supported by every client.<p>I don't think it's that much harder. Granted, if you're dealing with existing clients that only support a small subset of HTTP your choice of style might be made for you. If I'm designing a brand-new API I think I'd be inclined to say ""it's 2012 and this is an HTTP service, deal with it"".<p>PS, Thanks for the interesting discussion. It's definitely making me think this through more deeply than I have in the past.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Guiding_principles_of_the_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer...</a>",1348695658

My motto for years has been ""you can pry pointers and address spaces from my cold, dead hands.""<p>Of the new languages I've seen lately, Rust is my favorite.  I love how it gives me better ways to express things I actually want to say without imposing GC on me.<p>But even so, I can't see myself actually using it for much, because writing in a language other than C means buying in to that language's runtime.  Buying into one language's runtime means that your code won't play nice with <i>other</i> languages' runtimes.<p>If I write a library in Rust, how can I expose my types and algorithms to Ruby, Python, Lua, etc?  How will Rust Tasks play with Python threads?  What if I use a Rust Pipe to send a Python value between tasks?  How do I keep Rust from doing a GC pass while I'm holding the Python GIL?  etc. etc.<p>Programming Languages by their nature want to be at the center of your world.  If you buy into their abstractions, everything works nicely.  But if you try to mash two of them together in a single process, you start to suffer from the fact that their abstractions overlap and don't interoperate at all.<p>If you're only writing an application (ie. not a library) and never want to embed other languages into your application, then this might be ok.  But I'm more interested in writing shared functionality that is useful <i>across</i> languages.  Why should the whole stack of parsers, crypto, compression, etc. have to be written separately in each language?  Life is too short to do some great work that is only usable by one language community -- computing is so big and changes so much that one-language-only functionality is at best limiting your market and at worst dooming your code to obsolescence when the next big language comes around.<p>So as much as I instinctively like Rust, I think I'll be sticking with C.",1348694641

People who actually edit plain text files regularly (programmers and such) probably have a preferred editor that they use, and wouldn't really want to edit in a little <textarea>, unless you are proposing they build a more advanced text editor (I assume that's not what you mean though, you said it wouldn't be difficult).<p>2) Sure, but again, just because they can add a feature doesn't mean they should.<p>3) Interesting, I didn't know that.

It's simply a communication tool for notifying car owners of ANY issues with their vehicle. You can of course always tow if someone blocks your driveway. By using CurbTXT, you are not granted any immunity from parking violations, but you are allowing people to contact you directly. It is simply giving them a choice in how they make contact. If you are abusing the use of CurbTXT by say perpetually or indiscriminately parking wherever you want, you most likely will be towed, CurbTXT sticker or not.<p>However, if you happen to have left your lights on, or forgot to rotate your tires when on a hill, any neighbor can help you out with a friendly reminder. Other benefits would allow people to contact you if they noticed your car was being vandalized (by say someone keying your car).<p>Of course, CurbTXT isn't for everyone.

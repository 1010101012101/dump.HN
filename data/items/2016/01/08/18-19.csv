They won&#x27;t just say &quot;driving 5 mph over the speed limit on the highways raises rates&quot; for no reason. The reality is probably though, at some speed increase above the posted limits there is a relationship with claims activity. If that limit is 4 mph or 10 mph, I think it&#x27;s fair to charge more.<p>And can car computers tell if blinkers are on? At some point, changing without signaling is likely to be trackable if it isn&#x27;t already. Ultimately, clueless driving will leave trackable indicators. This is driving, it&#x27;s behavior based, and the outcomes are observable.<p>At any rate, I hope this makes usage-based insurance more common. I currently use MetroMile as my car insurer, which charges per mile of car usage. I&#x27;m a city-driver, my miles are insanely low.

(Thus all those Orientalizing synagogues.)<p>Of course, suicide bombings and suicide terrorism are bad because they&#x27;re bad, not because they&#x27;re Nazi-associated. (Conservation, sustainable forestry, and high minimum wages were also Nazi causes, after all.) But there&#x27;s a Nazi element in modern Islamic terror, which makes it particularly unsettling when a Westerner who&#x27;s apparently on the far left defends supporters of Islamic terror and supporters of a new Holocaust more or less in the same breath.",1452278727
10867156,comment,10821986,10863289,0,0,mikermcneil,,,"Thanks for following up, Clay.  Sorry sailsjs.org caused trouble for you last year.  You&#x27;re right-- fixing SEO permalinks in our docs (i.e. converting sailsjs.org from an SPA to a site w/ server-rendered views) was a pretty slow and involved process.  This was due in part to the fact that we switched to deeply-nested navigation in the docs, but also because of the sheer number of old links we had to maintain from two different past versions of the website.  We weren&#x27;t able to preserve them all, but we did our best to maintain the functionality of as many legacy hashbang (`#!`) and Angular-style (`/#/`) links as we could.  I&#x27;m glad to hear the doc links are working for you now.<p>We also owe Kevin Burke from Shyp a big thank you for drawing our attention to the SEO problem in the first place.  Regardless of where Shyp goes with their tech stack long term, it has been immensely helpful to learn from Kevin&#x27;s experiences using the framework there.  Those lessons have already impacted the direction of Sails, and will continue to influence its future development.<p>On the subject of documentation, I wanted to share two other resources from 2015, in case either of them might be helpful for you: The first is a free Sails course on Platzi (<a href=""https://courses.platzi.com/courses/develop-apps-sails-js/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://courses.platzi.com/courses/develop-apps-sails-js/</a>).  It covers best practices for authentication, blueprints vs. custom actions, and multi-instance deployment to Heroku, and contains some great Q&A.  The second is &quot;Sails.js in Action&quot; (<a href=""https://www.manning.com/books/sails-js-in-action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manning.com/books/sails-js-in-action</a>), a Manning book about Sails written by Irl Nathan (creator of Sailscasts) and myself.  It is set to be published this Spring.<p>Finally re: the next generation of Sailscasts-- I don&#x27;t want to speak for Irl there, but I should point out that there are 6 episodes of the second series of tutorials available (<a href=""https://github.com/irlnathan/activityoverlord20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/irlnathan/activityoverlord20</a>).

Farmer grows some years of high yield, high drain on the soil crops.  Good times, until they aren&#x27;t.<p>Greed may see sucking it dry as a good thing, but the expectation of high profit at low investment just won&#x27;t last.  What happens when the bounty in a rich, fertile soil is gone?<p>Tepid returns, that&#x27;s what.  Increases in risks and costs too.<p>Edit:  One could seek new, fresh ground, and repeat this.  At some point, there is a lot of sour, drained ground with the winners all fighting over the ever shrinking fertile ground remaining, a clear case of diminishing returns at the macro level, despite many success stories suggesting otherwise.<p>On the other hand, either taking a little less, say by staggering crops or resting ground, or reinvesting some of what is gained to keep the ground healthy and fertile, act together and the bounty possible goes from an awesome peak to something less, still good, but sustainable longer term.  Wealth can still be accumulated, but perhaps less liquid and larger amounts happen over longer periods of time.<p>In a very general sense, this all feels a lot like placing blame and shifting risks and costs around to avoid the more simple, direct and growing issue of how many of us just aren&#x27;t able to participate in the economy in a growth meaningful way.<p>In this sense, disruption is like crack.  Big gains are often had, and we like, want and need those, but it&#x27;s all just buying more time, not actually getting at root causes.  Because of that, many larger gains are offset by problem growth and tepid demand growth, neither of which do any of us longer term good.<p>And while each success appears to hint at an answer, we in a macro sense, just can&#x27;t seem to string enough of them together to make sustainable gains.<p>GDP limps along, while we all chase bright spots... and for many, standard of living declines, despite some growth which should seemingly preserve at least parity.",1452278702

Holistic verification of systems is extremely costly but necessary where human lives matter. However if someone finds a weird side-channel attack in a bitmap parsing library I think we can be more forgiving.<p>The whole idea that C programs are insecure by default and can never be secure is where theory wants to ignore the harsh realities. We can write languages with tighter constraints on the verification of the programs they create which will lower the risk of most security exploits by huge margins... but we have to trade something away for the benefit. The immediate costs being run-time performance or qualitative things like maintainability.<p>What I ultimately think will make these poor security researchers feel better is liability.

He plays by a completely different book than almost everyone else. He is not in the game to make money, he is in it to fix a few big problems for the whole mankind. His companies are only the vehicles to achieve this goal. SpaceX wasn&#x27;t created because he was looking for a way to make money and found that satellite launches are a market ripe for disruption. It was created because he wants humans to go to Mars, and (after failed attempts to buy ICBMs from Russia) starting a very innovative rocket company was the best way for him to make it happen.<p>I agree that what Elon did would not be possible if he was taxed at 80%. But he is an extreme case. He is an outlier in the outliers group. Most rich entrepreneurs, frankly, don&#x27;t give a shit. The few that do have often tied hands (there&#x27;s only so much you can do if your company has shareholders deciding about stuff). But most don&#x27;t give a shit. Can you imagine, say, CEO of Oracle investing all his wealth to literally force an electric car into market viability because he believes that we need to do something about sustainable energy <i>right fucking now</i>? I can&#x27;t.<p>So maybe that 80% tax would stop an occasional Elon Musk from saving the world. But if it also makes everyone much better off, then maybe it&#x27;s worth it.

They&#x27;re only 4 light-years away, so we should pretty easily be able to detect their TV broadcasts and other RF emissions at that distance.  The main problem with SETI&#x27;s approach I think is that it assumes RF emissions are strong enough to detect from huge distances (AC is the closest system to ours, everything else is farther), and that the ETs are at a similar level technologically and use strong RF transmitters rather than short-range spread-spectrum stuff, so that&#x27;s a pretty short time window technologically, combined with the distance (it takes decades or centuries for signals to travel here from other star systems).  But for a hypothetical humanity clone in the AC system, these problems don&#x27;t hold, and we really should be able to detect them I think.

It&#x27;s got all the snapshotting and build/distribution infrastructure.

The interspersed moving GIFs were a nice touch as well.<p>I&#x27;ll add places I&#x27;ve been to that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned:<p>* Hangzhou, China - I spent about three days hanging around West Lake/Xi Hu (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake</a>), a large, BEAUTIFUL lake adjacent to the city. Sprawling mountains in the background, an endless amount of Chinese gardens and beautiful greenery surrounding it. Cheap boat rides that you can drive yourself, and an extreme dearth of Western tourists - even by China standards. Though, I went during the summer and the place was swarming with Chinese tourists. Maybe my favorite meal in China was in a modern restaurant in a random mall there. I&#x27;d honestly consider Xi Hu one of the most beautiful places I&#x27;ve been.<p>* Malmo, Sweden - I didn&#x27;t go to the countryside like the article recommends though did a day trip to the nearby University town of Lund, which is nice but nothing cooler than most small European cities. The city itself has nothing in particular worth seeing - it&#x27;s still fairly expensive, though probably cheap by Scandanvian standards. I did stumble upon some good restaurants. I enjoyed Stockholm a lot more, and wouldn&#x27;t return to Malmo if it weren&#x27;t for a friend I have there. Gothenburg\nseems a lot cooler but sadly I never made it out there. Definitely avoid in the late fall / winter due to cold weather.<p>* Kansai, Japan - I spent a little over a weekin Osaka and various small towns in the area (Nara, Ouji). I got the sense that besides Tokyo and its surrounding area, Kansai contained a good chunk of the interesting tourist things in Japan. Himeji castle is an hour or two bullet train ride away (and many of the towns nearby have similar castles), Mt Fuji is in the area, there are great onsen / hostsprings, Kyoto and the closeby area appears to contain the strongest density of old shrines and temples, and Nara is famous for the thousands of wild deer intermixed with old shrines and temples. Hiroshima is a few hour train ride away and has a lot to see: the A-Bomb museum, memorial, infamous bombed dome remains, and Miyajima - a beautiful island also with wild deer and shrines that I unfortunately missed due to rain. If you have enough time and railpass duration, take a (~3-6 hour) train to Fukouka and then the (~$100/each way) fast ferry to Busan, Korea. I LOVED Busan. Also: be sure to buy the Japan rail pass BEFORE you get to Japan. You can&#x27;t get it in Japan.<p>* Malaga, Spain - this one has been mentioned, but I&#x27;ll add it did seem much more touristy and built up than other parts of Andalusia. The pros of this are there are some nice restaurants and bars and still some good historical stuff - like a nice Moorish fort and Roman ampitheater in the center. I was there in the winter (still ~60 degrees F) but there are beaches. I&#x27;d recommend checking out nearby Granada for Alhambra and Sevilla was also cool. Cordoba is overrated and this is coming from a huge history nerd.<p>* Phnom, Penh - this one was also mentioned. I found this place incredibly depressing. Nearly everywhere you go there are often disfigured or limb-missing locals begging (I am guessing this the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge). They&#x27;re not actually begging for money, but rather to give you a tuk-tuk ride, which was unusual to begging in other places I&#x27;ve been where people usually just ask for money. It&#x27;s very dirty - like usually you rent a tuk tuk (think 1970s era chariot - motorcycle with wagon on the back), and I remember getting really dusty just from driving around. The Cambodians are incredibly nice and speak remarkably good English especially compared to the even more heavily tourist-exposed neighboring Thais. You can shoot an AK-47 for $50 at an army range and even a bazooka if you&#x27;re willing to pay ~$300 (though I found out later in my trip it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to shoot an AK and Russian weapons in the Baltics - mainly Estonia and Latvia). Angkor Wat in nearby Siem Reap is a MUST see.",1452276580

Famously, the NRA supported the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (which banned new automatic weapons from going into civilian hands). There was a shift in the organization away from the Fudds in the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s.

Which by the way, NASA had achieved long ago.<p>SpaceX innovated with their cost cutting, and maybe now their manufacturing processes, and by being lucky by benefitting from a period of cost cutting by NASA whereby they could hire a bunch of NASA engineers/scientists.",1452276187

If I&#x27;m declaring a simple loop variable that&#x27;s I know is going to have a small lower-bound, I just use an int. The chances are pretty good that &#x27;int&#x27; maps to a good size for the platform, regardless of what platform it is and what it actually provides. &#x27;int_least16_t&#x27; probably does too, but it&#x27;s much more likely I have &#x27;int&#x27; around then &#x27;int_least16_t&#x27;, and between the two &#x27;int&#x27; is much more self-explanatory as to why I choose to use it.",1452276186

Many Linux users have been able to avoid it thus far, by sticking to 6.x Of RedHat and derivatives, or Debian 7. As these versions become longer in the tooth, it will be interesting to see if more people will switch over to FreeBSD. Popularity may not be a good thing however, with the recent political drama and institution of a code of conduct getting in the way of FreeBSD&#x27;s meritocratic approach. Thankfully, there&#x27;s still plenty of choice available in open source operating systems. Thankfully, we can always trust Theo to keep OpenBSD&#x27;s purist approach to technical correctness :P",1452276138

Communism isn&#x27;t the solution, capitalism is better but has problems as well. We should all work to resolve those problems even if capitalism is currently the best possible solution. Extreme Wealth inequality is a problem of unfairness and we should strive to resolve the problem without giving up the benefits that come with capitalism.<p>I disagree with the fact the billionaire can&#x27;t be replaced. The billionaire isn&#x27;t some special human being. I would argue if you replace the current CEO of apple with a random apple SW engineer, the company wouldn&#x27;t change much.<p>In fact I would argue that skilled work, the work of software engineers is by far much more irreplaceable. The person who coded the critical infrastructure for the apple operating system, he is by far harder to replace then the billionaire on top.

In casual language, it&#x27;s easier to say something like<p><pre><code>    They [it&#x27;s always &#x27;they&#x27;] planned this! The people pushing the TPP are\n    trying to scam us!\n</code></pre>\nwhen what is really intended might be closer to<p><pre><code>    The people in a position that has actual decision-making power or influence\n    usually got to that position by using large amounts of money. The sources of\n    that money vary, but in any case an attitude is cultivated where money ends\n    up as the primary indicator when judging success.\n\n    When considering future policies, people with this type of attitude will\n    tend to prefer plans that maximize what they see as &quot;success&quot;m which is \n    any plan that maximizes money, regardless of other effects. Hence concepts\n    like the ISDS (both as an idea and it&#x27;s idiotic implementations) are seen as\n    absolutely necessary to &quot;protect investors&quot; (maximize money/success), while\n    national sovereignty, health-and-safety regulations, and the possibility of\n    laws that require exposing source code are all seen as roadblocks to success.\n\n    Therefor, without any need for conspiracy, plans such as the TPP can gain \n    significant support because it aligns with the priorities of the people in power.\n</code></pre>\nor something like that. Obviously, the latter is harder to say and probably impossible to say as a sound-bite. The former statement - which <i>sounds</i> like it requires a conspiracy - is often used as a shorthand, sometimes for brevity, sometimes because the speaker doesn&#x27;t know how to articulate the longer variation in detail.<p>Of course, sometimes people actually intend to make an accusation of conspiracy... and sometimes villainous people actually do get together and make harmful plans.<p>I suggest that it&#x27;s useful to assume a charitable interpretation when reading this kind of statement for two reasons: 1) Hanlon&#x27;s Razor, and 2) often the details don&#x27;t really matter (an international treaty can be just as damaging regardless of it&#x27;s origin).<p>Unfortunately, American politics has always had a certain <i>paranoid style</i>[1].<p>> TPP has only a marginal impact on US public policy<p>That <i>may</i> be true in the short term, but it&#x27;s hard to change treaties and the laws they create once they are enacted. If our position in the world changes in the future, we may find the tools the TPP creates being used against us.<p>The American Empire is <i>rapidly</i> in decline[2]. While it&#x27;s hard to say what that means for the political and economic future of the world, it&#x27;s probably safe to say that at least some of the power that America currently holds will move elsewhere.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics#Recurring_paranoia_in_American_politics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjY-FW7-dc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjY-FW7-dc</a>",1454644035

I&#x27;ve never tried this on an external monitor and external input devices. There&#x27;s also a gap because you need a separate vnc client.<p>Maru, if it exists, seems to work off the same concept, but with some polish. They have an install of Debian that can run on your phone. The Maru app will run in the background and detect when an external display is connected. This tells it to spin up the debian OS. Then it must do something to connect to debian&#x27;s desktop (vnc, nomachine, or proprietary solution), and output that solely to the secondary screen.<p>This last bit seems the most magical to me (and probably device dependent), but then again, my experience with android and secondary displays is somewhat limited to the mirroring that happens when you attach a monitor. Alternatively is the chromecast concept where your app turns into a control and the content is sent to the chromecast.

I also know that many people have worked on these sorts of histories, even if Haigh and Knuth say it&#x27;s less common now. Are there any lessons from those experiences?

We&#x27;ve been a customer for 2 years, surely they could pick up the phone and call us.

The author is totally right... demystifying what was going on was key to getting my feet wet.  I soon learned that BASIC was an interpreted language (which is why I couldn't just run it at the command line), and that I needed a ""compiler"" to make machine code, or learn assembly, so then I wanted a compiler, and I learned C, etc. etc. etc.<p>Twenty something years later, I don't think the experience left me with any scars or bad habits, but I might not be a programmer today if I hadn't started with BASIC.",1261364273

The negatives, less so.  But even when the quality of immigrants is high, you have issues.  For instance, there are large numbers of Chinese in Malaysia, the Philippines, etc, and they are exactly what you'd think you'd want: They're smart, hard-working, entrepreneurial.  The effect, however, is resentment and affirmative-action-style laws against them.  They certainly improve the GDP of the geographic areas they live in, but it's the <i>per capita</i> rundown of that GDP that matters to the natives.  European immigration to America really did improve the place a lot, unless you're on a reservation.  It's not unusual.<p>In practice, however, you aren't going to get your dream migrants, but a hit-and-miss assemblage.  Entrepreneurs and professionals, yes, but also servants for the UMC and peasants for big agra and chicken-packers for Tyson, as well as criminals and parasites.<p><i>There's plenty of empty housing stock</i><p>Think twice when you say, essentially, ""Well, we have shit to sell so let's import some customers.""

I could certainly see people absolutely exploding when they see that they've been flagged as uncivil.  Add a message on top of it, and things will definitely get out of hand at least some of the time.  But if the connection starts to just get dropped, they maybe keep refreshing, maybe go somewhere else.",1261361474

This is much different from 'cutting' type 2 diabetes risk.<p>It is more likely that not drinking sugar water (i.e. coke, mountain dew) that cuts type 2 diabetes risk.<p>(As stated in the comments).<p>Tea and coffee are merely a means to quit drinking as much sugar water. You could likely replace tea and coffee with 'tap water' and 'bottled water', and get similarly good results.",1261361441

The article strongly supports immigration, which is to be expected from the economist, but I'd say it expresses no opinion on unlimited immigration, other than to mention that ""No rich country allows unlimited immigration"".<p>I find it frustrating that a country that admits 1.2 million immigrants a year is so often accused of being ""anti-immigrant"" because it does not adopt the unique policy of unlimited immigration.<p>I'm also a little surprised to see the economist describing immigration as a ponzi scheme, even if they do call it one that works.  Ponzi schemes always appear to work for the first few iterations.",1261361011

I can think of times where I wanted to comment directly to the poster privately. So maybe there is an even more generalized solution for providing feedback/responses.<p>Flags are a good idea too. The HN feature set is still minimal and polished compared to other similar sites. So the community is really sensitive to any changes. From seeing previous feature experiments I think the only way to really see if it works is to implement it and get feedback. I remember some previous features that seemed like they would be great(!) when they were written up and first implemented. Then after a few hours or days were frustrating.

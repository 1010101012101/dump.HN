7810226,comment,7805144,7809634,1,0,mixonic,,,"Web accessibility, as we commonly use the term, pertains to creating a website that disabled users can interact with an navigate. It does not pertain to those who choose to or are forced to disable JavaScript (the RMS example). Creating an accessible site is a challenge regardless of what technologies you pick, for sure. Just as saying &quot;just because your screenreader supports JavaScript does not mean you have no accessibility issues&quot;, just because your website uses JavaScript doesn&#x27;t mean you have accessibility issues. A plain HTML website can have accessibility issues. So can a JavaScript one.<p>AFAIK, nothing in WCAG says you must have a non-JavaScript fallback to adhere to their standard. If you can back that up I am all ears, I would be interested to read it.<p>> Google making this change makes it possible to have your non-fallback JS-only application be indexed. It does not make it more attractive from an SEO or accessibility viewpoint.<p>The attractiveness of JS heavy development is not in an inherent SEO or accessibility benefit. Absolutely true.<p>The benefit is a development style that is more productive, giving me more time as a developer to focus on solving the problem at hand, be it business logic, SEO, or accessibility. You can debate this benefit, but don&#x27;t imply that single-page apps cannot have SEO on par with HTML sites and good accessibility.",1401288539

Rust emphasizes zero-cost abstractions with compiler-enforced memory & thread safety. The popular web development languages are dynamically typed and interpreted, with an emphasis on rapid development, which is a very different niche than Rust claims to fill.<p>Perhaps Rust could be used to build a highly optimized server for a large site, but at that point it would probably better  to write the application to run on the JVM.

It seems like this GC advocacy is based upon a checkmark more than a reality.<p>My experience has been that Go has very lightweight GC. The compiler intelligently turns a significant number of allocations into stack allocations (the same allocations would be heap allocations in .NET and Java, by comparison). It, by design, minimizes the amount of work that the GC needs to do, and in most real projects it just becomes a complete non-issue.",1401287849

Why don&#x27;t people get on board?<p>First, they don&#x27;t trust you to be right about all the trade-offs. This mistrust only <i>increases</i> when you tell them to get with the times; it&#x27;s clear distaste for their preferences, so it only signals that you don&#x27;t value their input.<p>Second, <i>even if</i> your new society model is better, you have to get people to use it.  And if the way you transition is &quot;everyone give up your old thing, then we will all move to the new thing, trust me,&quot; they will do the opposite of trust you.<p>Self-driving cars are a very nice transition, because no one is forcing them into use.  You can have one if you want.  You can hear your friend talking about how useful they are.  You can try it out, and if you don&#x27;t like it you don&#x27;t have to use it.<p>&quot;No one owns a car&quot; is not a nice transition, no matter how awesome you think it is in the latest novel you read about able-bodied and pretty 20-somethings.  Public transportation really sucks in a lot of places precisely because making public transportation awesome gets less priority than a bunch of other things, like demanding that people get to bring their pets or bikes on board, or the homeless people using it as a place to sleep.<p>You can make a very good case that social justice requires letting the homeless sleep on the buses.  That&#x27;s fine. It may even be the right call. But it means that no one else will want to use the buses.  (NYC has cops every block to keep the homeless moving along, and their public transport is pretty nice.)<p>Buses <i>could</i> be awesome, if they were managed like Google buses.

I am a former chemical engineer turned programmer a couple of years ago, currently doing web development full time (Python/Django)<p>I have been trying to compensate for my lack of formal training by following the Stanford CS program as many courses are available online. I can’t believe all those excellent courses are available for free (thanks Coursera!). In particular I have been enjoying the lower level stuff compared to my day-to-day job as a web dev. The cryptography, networks, algorithms, FP and compilers courses have all been real eye openers for me (look mom, built a compiler!).<p>Anyway, I don’t have any mentors or the like to bounce my ideas, so that’s why I am posting here. I am thinking about contributing to open source projects to get more experience, and perhaps switching jobs to something related to my new interests?<p>I am also thinking about focusing on newer fields, where you are not expected to have 10 years of experience to get in the door.

One good approach to using Excel is to always be in one of two modes: changing the structure (equivalent to coding) and entering values (equivalent to using software).  Of course, at the early stages of designing something you will be entering lots of dummy values (e.g. ARPU) to check that your formulae work.<p>However, many people don&#x27;t distinguish between collections (rows, columns or other contiguous areas) of cells which _should_ contain values, and those which should contain formulae.  I, like many, prefer to indicate input cells with a yellow or orange background, so that I know everything else is a formula.<p>You can do even better:<p>- If you&#x27;re done designing a spreadsheet, and expect to use it for a production process, then mark the input cells as unlocked, and protect all the sheets.  Then the end user won&#x27;t be able to mess up the formulae.<p>- Always write formulae in a way that they can be copied across or down whilst pointing to the right places.  This can be achieved through use of one or more $ signs to fix a reference.  I&#x27;ve seen a fair number of spreadsheets where there are a large number of similar formulae, but they have been entered/adjusted manually.  This is fine only if you never make mistakes, and if no one else needs to change the formulae later or verify they are correct.<p>My point is that &quot;formula results that got turned into static data&quot; can be avoided with just a few easy rules.

Modern Perl came out 5 years ago and was really just codifying best practice at the time.<p>It&#x27;s still the same language if you want it to be. Backwards compatability is taken very seriously. Which - yes - does mean that you can write crappy old perl in it if you want to. (And also that all the crappy old perl you have lying around will continue to work).<p>But it&#x27;s also a pretty vibrant, modern language. Any new project or new perl codebase can and should be written in modern perl. And - despite your assertions - it&#x27;s still very much the same language.<p>Just now with extra, better stuff too.",1401285729

Instead of giving reasonable arguments against mocking, the author offers an example where mocking was used wrong and therefore propagates that it shouldn&#x27;t be used at all.<p>The problem is not mocking. I found it to be absolutely helpful if used right (and right often means sparsely).\nThe problem is this &quot;all or nothing&quot; mentality that many programmers have. Either they mock the hell out of the codebase or they don&#x27;t use it at all.<p>I don&#x27;t use mock objects, unless it&#x27;s message based business logic, often located at the topmost layer of abstraction.",1401285700

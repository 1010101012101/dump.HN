He assumes the purpose is to increase brute force search complexity or somehow add additional secrecy, and is correct that it fails at both.<p>If you are already using user specific salts and a strong SHA hash, the next place you should be looking to add security is increasing the number of rounds (i.e. sha(sha(sha(hash+pass)))) or switching to bcrypt (which takes advantage of an expensive key setup phase in blowfish to make brute force searches very painful).",1305330894

2546626,comment,2546171,2546362,8,0,sigil,,,"> Encrypt with Truecrypt, share with Dropbox. Problem solved.<p>Not so fast. How big is the binary diff when you change a file within a Truecrypt volume? Ie, how much Dropbox bandwidth will you be using, even with a small change?<p>I performed the following experiment. Start with a 250M Truecrypt volume. Mount it. Create a 1M file from /dev/random. Unmount the volume.<p>Now, look at what blocks in the Truecrypt volume file have changed. Dropbox uses a 4M blocksize [1].<p><pre><code>  seq 0 63 | while read i; do
    { dd bs=4M skip=$i count=0; dd bs=4M count=1; } < truecrypt.bin.before | md5sum
  done 2>/dev/null | sort > md5s.before

  seq 0 63 | while read i; do
    { dd bs=4M skip=$i count=0; dd bs=4M count=1; } < truecrypt.bin.after | md5sum
  done 2>/dev/null | sort > md5s.after

  comm -13 md5s.before md5s.after | wc -l
  8
</code></pre>
Conclusion: in this case, Dropbox will transfer 32M (8x the normal 4M) because I added a 1M file to my Truecrypt volume. Note: I haven't tried adding bigger files, but suspect the number of blocks changed will go up linearly but steeply with the size of the added file.<p>It's not actually that surprising that TrueCrypt mixes file changes throughout the volume file.<p>Why bring this all up? Because something that does client side block encryption (tarsnap is an example) would only transfer the affected block. 4M, if that's the block size.<p>And you don't have to trust the cloud storage provider at all.<p>EDIT: My pipelines were wrong on the first go, suggesting a much larger number of differing blocks.

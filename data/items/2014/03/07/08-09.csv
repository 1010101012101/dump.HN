Why should developers need to learn your specific wrapper on top of a popular 3rd party component? The internal thing is most likely not documented as well, and common problems don&#x27;t have answers on Stack Overflow. It requires extra work to use additional features of the library.<p>I&#x27;m similarly wary of convenience libraries that provide marginally simpler APIs on top of standard libraries.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good idea. I wish I had your experience. Any good reading material?",1394182788

What the hell? It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.&quot;<p>Asked if he was technically able to come up with the idea for bitcoin, Nakamoto responded: &quot;Capability? Yes, but any programmer could do that.&quot;</i><p>For someone who only recently heard about BitCoin this seems like an odd response.  It almost seems like if you made a factually incorrect technical statement about BitCoin in his presence -- he might correct you.",1394179809

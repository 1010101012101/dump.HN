OK, there are real limitations, like the BBC censorship of comments on their website (they call it moderation). But mostly it is orwellian double-thinking occupying the mind of the average Westerner. Examples?

The same day a guy wrote on his t-shirt something to the effect of ""kill pigs for fun hahahaah."" This is a stupid thing to do. I would have thought the police might confiscate his t-shirt. Nope, that wouldn't have been sufficient. He got 4 months in prison.<p>After any major crime you hear that someone has been arrested because they have set up a fan page or wrote some stupid comments online praising the person who did it. I would have thought Facebook moderation would be sufficient.<p>Most recently.. a girl went missing. Some muppet on Facebook wrote how he ""woke up"" next to her. Not all of his comments were posted but these appear to be on his Facebook wall. He wasn't trolling the family or abusing memorial pages. He is now spending 3 months in prison...<p>You then have the frustrated traveler who said he would blow an air port ""sky high"". He was arrested, found guilty and fined. It took a year or two to finally win an appeal.<p>I am not defending these people. They have done stupid things. Some should be warned by police. However, there appears to be a crackdown going on quietly if you cause even the slightest offense. As a citizen of a western country this worries my greatly.",1350291231

4654270,comment,4652827,4652827,1,0,adaml_623,,,"2 unclear articles.<p>Antirez's philosophy seems to be: <i>In general if there is a problem at the work place between individual A and B, I think it is always an error to talk about sexism, even when the root cause is some asshole not respecting you because you are a woman. Instead the problem should be addressed in a sexual agnostic way.</i><p>Shanley's rebuttal to this is: <i>Oh, OK, Salvatore. Lets definitely not talk about sexism in the workplace, even if THATS THE f</i><i></i>ing ROOT CAUSE OF A PROBLEM. * ... * even though sexism is BY ITS f<i></i><i>ing NATURE a systemic force, especially in the workplace where issues around gender inequality are created and enforced on a cultural and institutional level. </i>
And goes on to say <i>What you are proposing is not a viable solution in any way </i> (apologies if censoring swearwords offends.)<p>Shanley's point seems to be that that sexism isn't just/merely an interaction between individuals and any simplistic solution that tells person A to act identically to person B regardless of any attribute of B except for skill in performing their job is naive.<p>If my summary is correct then I agree with S that this is not a problem that can be solved simply.

4654269,comment,4653370,4653370,1,0,netcan,,,"There is another aspect to this. A ban on blasphemy, in a wide sense of the world is very natural to us. We are used to living under these restrictions. They are imposed by religion, law & taboo/culture almost everywhere including the west.<p>The blatant simple versions are religious laws often absorbed into law about denying the truth of a religion, worshiping other gods, etc.  There are often also similar restrictions  on criticism/denial of monarchs. When these get stronger and more elaborate, we tend to call these ""State Religions"" (eg north korea) hinting at how closely we associate religions with blasphemy/heresy laws.<p>A more modern ""light"" varient has cultural pressures at the core. It is considered bad form almost everywhere to openly criticize someone's ""beliefs."" Beliefs must be mutually respected. They cannot be held against someone. They are treated as a part of one's ethnicity. As far as I can tell this has two sources. The original religious law one (Dawkins has fascinating memetic explanation for this) and a sort of cultural compromise reached enough times following religious wars that it has become deeply ingrained in cultures.<p>We are predisposed to respecting blasphemy and heresy laws.",1350290949

You cannot uphold a dictatorship of unsubstantiated claims if everybody is allowed to openly ask questions. This pattern is always the same in every authoritarian structure and is in no way specific to religion, religion only has a special word for it. Blasphemy is what the kid in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" did at the end of the tale: publicly questioning authority, which led to authority breaking down.<p>> What the heck is a ""hate crime""?<p>For example public calls for Jews to be gassed.",1350290862

4654263,comment,4652857,4654135,4,0,philwelch,,,"What feminists and theologians have in common--and how I differ from them, based on more familiarity with epistemology than you think--is that they never seem to entertain the possibility that they are wrong. I, on the other hand, don't actually claim to know anything about anything as mysterious as gods, or as complicated as human society. I just have working estimates.<p>I trust that other people have evidence that I don't and that they can't give to me. I can even accept it as some sort of indirect evidence, so that if other people unanimously tell me that Nevada exists and practically no one disagrees, I accept the claim. What I can't do is accept a seemingly dogmatic ideology like feminism based solely upon trusting some, but clearly not all women. I can be influenced by it, and when presented with direct and indirect evidence I can allow that evidence to upgrade my estimate, but in my experience feminists are unaccepting of anything short of full, dogmatic agreement. That--the attitude of any ideologue--is as good a marker as I've ever found that someone isn't using their evidence correctly.<p>My working estimate so far includes a pretty reliable heuristic--it's always more complicated. Feminism, like any ideology, is actually pretty enlightening from a certain perspective, since it raises a lot of issues that can complicate our understanding of the world. But the problem is, the world is even more complicated than the feminists themselves think.<p>So yes, I listen to indirect evidence, but I don't buy other people's conclusions wholesale. And far from being arrogant--I'm often more willing to throw my hands in the air and admit I really don't and can't know the answer to the question. I struggle with things like voting a lot because of this.",1350290688

Look at the number of bizarre little cults and would-be prophets among humans today; multiply that by 6,000 years or so of recorded history, and it's no wonder some of them have turned out to be world-shapingly successful.<p>The exact formula for a successful religion is different for different religions, places and times.  But it doesn't stretch the imagination to think that violent suppression of expressions of disbelief, doubt, or disrespect might be part of a formula that allows a religion to spread and maintain power.<p>In other words, maybe religions that <i>don't</i> have prohibitions against blasphemy are quickly torn apart by heretics and skeptics -- or at least limited in size and power.<p>This isn't a <i>justification</i> of blasphemy prohibitions; it's merely an <i>explanation</i> of why a successful religion (in terms of number of believers) might have such a rule:  because the rule is what <i>causes</i> the success.",1350290574

I can honestly say that I have never seen any of these come up.<p>In case anyone is worried, the sizeof('i') one looks, at first glance, like the most worrying one.<p>However, it is less serious than it might look. Given ""char c;"", sizeof(c) evaluates to 1 in both languages, it is just a single character constant like 'i' which causes a possible problem.<p>For anyone curious why, I'm not sure why character constants are int in C, but in pure C I think it is impossible to tell that a character literal is an int (as there is no function overloading, or type deductions).<p>In C++ however, with function overloading, we can tell. In particular, we really want:<p>std::cout << 1 << 'i' << std::endl;<p>To print the number 1, followed by the letter i. Therefore we need the letter i to be of type char, rather than another int.<p>(Fixed last 'C' to 'C++' : Thanks dbaupp)",1350288696

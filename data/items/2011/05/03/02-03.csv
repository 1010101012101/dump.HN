It's not necessarily sexist for Barney to _only care about looks,_ or at least: since we all care about looks to some degree, it is dangerous to imply that caring about looks is sexist.  And if his analysis of his desires is based on his decision to only try for attractiveness, how is that analysis sexist instead of revealing the frailty of being so shallow?<p>So the comparison is basically that there are two orthogonal traits, one negative and one positive.

2508726,comment,2506918,2506918,4,0,dustingetz,,,"there's a better reason, per TomF's blog[1] linked below by JabavuAdams.\n--<p>""any time you do a subtract (or an add, implicitly), consider what happens when the two numbers are very close together, e.g. 1.0000011 - 1.0. The result of this is going to be roughly 0.0000011 of course, but the ""roughly"" is going to be pretty rough. In general you only get about six-and-a-bit decimal digits of precision from floats (2^23 is 8388608), so the problem is that 1.0000011 isn't very precise - it could be anywhere between 1.0000012 or 1.0000010. So the result of the subtraction is anywhere between 1.2<i>10^-6 and 1.0</i>10^-6. That's not very impressive precision, having the second digit be wrong! So you need to refactor your algorithms to fix this.<p>The most obvious place this happens in games is when you're storing world coodinates in standard float32s, and two objects get a decent way from the origin. The first thing you do in rendering is to subtract the camera's position from each object's position, and then send that all the way down the rendering pipeline. The rest all works fine, because everything is relative to the camera, it's that first subtraction that is the problem. For example, getting only six decimal digits of precision, if you're 10km from the origin (London is easily over 20km across), you'll only get about 1cm accuracy. Which doesn't sound that bad in a static screenshot, but as soon as things start moving, you can easily see this horrible jerkiness and quantisation.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://home.comcast.net/~tom_forsyth/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BA%20matter%20of%20precision%5D%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.comcast.net/~tom_forsyth/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BA%...</a>",1304389223

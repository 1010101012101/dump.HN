After creating an account, the app is basically empty, telling me I have to share some music on my computer. Weird, but ok, so I come back here and try your link again, and I still get the same page asking me to install your app. Is this how it's supposed to work?",1332003591
3717493,comment,3717021,3717021,6,0,Stwerner,,,"While programming I love scribbling down notes and ideas on a notepad.  There is something about the change in mindset or context from screen and keyboard to pen and paper that helps me see the whole picture of what I am working on, or even just get a thought out of my head temporarily to be able to stay on the current task. Does anyone else do this, and have you found any piece of technology to replace that?",1332003584
3717492,comment,3717084,3717084,23,0,ma2rten,,,"I feel like I have just seen the future and it is very bright. This would make mobile development so much easier and open up a completely new range of possibilities.<p>Just imagine ....<p>- writing just one app that runs on every desktop and mobile phone out there.<p>- apps which update entirely automatically, without any extra line of code, because they are basically just cached versions of a website.<p>- a designer, who just knows CSS & HTML, can make an entirely new GUI for your phone.<p>- an eco-system where the development of the interface (HTML) is completely separate from the kernel/browser and you can choose which kernels/rendering engine to run on your phone, independent of the user interface and vice versa.<p>- etc. etc.<p>Kudos to Mozilla for their vision and for not just developing the technology, but making a good looking prototype to demonstrate it.<p>However, I am a little bit skeptical that a web-based OS will perform the same as a native OS, especially in terms of battery consumption. But smartphones only get more powerful and html rendering engines only faster, so it can only be a matter of time. Also a little nitpick with respect to the title: the OS not entirely build using HTML, CSS and JS, it's just the user interface, which is just small part of the OS (compared to the kernel, etc.).<p>EDIT: I know most of this is already possible in principle, but the user / developer experience would be completely different.",1332003580

Spotify lets you look at what other users listen to and their playlists (if they haven chosen to show them to the public) and I can subscribe to those playlist as well.  The thing I guess they talk about is that you can't see who listens to a specific artist, you won't be able to get a huge list of usernames that listen to a certain artist.

Being proud of an intrinsically limited product (this is a linux that runs only one program by design, so this is less capable than an android or whatever) for the improvements it can brings as side effects is one thing, but a statement like ""this is running the web directly"" is misleading because it will be understood as the real stuff by less knowledgeable people who will believe in some kind of incredibly innovative magic, like a magical processor ""running the web"" or i don't know what idiotic fantasm, instead of taking the thing for what it is: a system that can do less, with maybe <i>some</i> advantages as a side effects, but of course some inconveniences too.",1332003546

You have 3 different means of markup being parsed from the get-go: HTML/SGML, XML and JSON. HTML is a quite lightweight component, OK. But then you get CSS. CSS used to be simple, but it's getting incredibly complex with tons of new standardised features and vendor prefixes. Initially it just drew lines and boxes in colour with text, positioned correctly on the page according to a few simple positioning systems. Now it draws coloured boxes and lines with 3d transformations, animated, with alpha transparency, a drop shadow and rounded corners, at the same time as rendering text, and positioning them correctly on the page using several different layout systems. Then, there's the image formats commonly supported. PNG, JPEG, GIF, and ICO (Windows, favicons). SVG, a fully-featured vector graphics format which also uses CSS, as well as having its own, different animation system, and its own scripting system! Then we have common audio and video formats. MP3, WAV, OGG, MP4/H264 and WEBM. As well as the subtitle formats. Oh yeah, MathML parsing is in there somewhere too.<p>And then we have Javascript, a simple, not terribly complex language. OK. But we also have tons of APIs for it. The Document Object Model API. The XMLHttpRequest API. The Canvas API - a complete 2d rendering context AND full OpenGL ES 2.0. WebSockets. Local storage and session storage. IndexedDB. Game controller API. Page visibility API. Audio composition API (forgot proper name). Touch events. BlobBuilder. Geolocation. History API.<p>Just to name a bit of it.",1332001230

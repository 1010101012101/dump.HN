Last summer, one of these was blocked by an accident [1], leading to a complete gridlock on the highway for five hours, and downtown traffic was taking roughly ~30 minutes to travel a block.<p>It would be relatively easy to cause five significant wrecks on each of these corridors. Rent a moving truck and crash it into several vehicles at high speed. Traffic would be so congested, it would take hours for emergency crews to get to the scene. If you did this during morning rush hour, I imagine you could shut down a lot of the city for the day.<p>[1] <a href=""http://westseattleblog.com/2014/06/4-miles-of-highway-closure-5-hours-of-gridlock-this-cant-happen-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://westseattleblog.com/2014/06/4-miles-of-highway-closur...</a>",1446490787

Polling at 0% isn&#x27;t exactly fixed by a televised debate. Sanders is competing with Hillary on a fairly close scale and yet a lot of people still say he has no chance (though I definitely think he does at this point, but I&#x27;m not a US citizen so...), so what could possibly happen with Lessig?",1446490760
10494141,comment,10488991,10492369,0,0,lucozade,,,"> The resistance to change is stunning<p>If you ask a bunch of people who are analytically trained to ignore all the evidence in front of them you should expect this reaction. Especially if you tell them, to paraphrase, all they need to do is change their culture and all processes and everything will be rosy.<p>Pointing to books written by quality consultants isn&#x27;t going to help your case much either I&#x27;m afraid.<p>Which is a shame. If you&#x27;ve ever been in an organisation that has this deep-seated view of quality it is quite an eye-opener. Of those that I am familiar with, only GE really were able to take it beyond manufacturing and definitely the only one where I saw it applied to software. It felt a little &quot;religious cult&quot;y at first but was pretty impressive nonetheless.<p>Your focus on Edwards Deming is a little unfortunate too, as I would expect that most people with an engineering bent will look at his work on SPC and, rightly, consider it inapplicable to software. It requires a high level of repetition to be valuable and software development doesn&#x27;t have that.<p>His work on organisations could be applicable but it would require most companies to fundamentally change the way they approach almost everything. On the basis that it&#x27;s not necessary to do this, I can only see it occurring if it became necessary. A special set of circumstances brought it to prevalence in manufacturing and by no means universally. If it happens to software I think it would need an equivalent set.",1446490741

10494122,comment,10492824,10493800,0,0,ConceptJunkie,,,"I thought &quot;First Contact&quot; was not a very good Trek movie.  It always struck me as a movie that was made from a non-Star Trek script that was retroactively made into a Star Trek script.  I also thought Captain Picard&#x27;s behavior was wildly inconsistent with how he was portrayed in the show... not where he went all &quot;Goodfellas&quot; on the Borg in the holodeck, that was a fine character moment, but when he &quot;mercy killed&quot; one of his crew.  This was something the TV Picard would never have done.  He would have risked his life and the whole ship to save that one crewman and not just given up so early one... after all, he was dragged off and assimilated himself, but he was rescued and recovered.<p>&quot;First Contact&quot; also played fast and loose with established canon a lot more than any other movie had done.  I didn&#x27;t care for the portrayal of Cochrane as a drunk loser (although this has no bearing on James Cromwell&#x27;s performance... he is always great).<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with action in Trek... it&#x27;s built into the concept, but the action was always less important than the Big Ideas... at least until some of the movies, and especially the vapid JJTrek reboots came along.",1446490630

There is no way to guarantee success at just any given goal.  Sometimes the opportunity to have a good goal fall into your lap, or things to line up in support of the goal you chose, is just luck.  If nothing else, there&#x27;s an element of luck in whether your heart continues beating (even if your goal is within reasonable constraints of life expectancy and health.)  Sure, if you care about something, work as hard as you can to find out whether you have that luck.

But finding strong correlations between twins raised apart would seem to indicate that many of the genetic factors are <i>not</i> entirely environment-sensitive.<p>> I also don&#x27;t think any genes actually code for intelligence as it&#x27;s commonly understood. Intelligence is, basically, knowledge (including knowledge about how to acquire knowledge). Genes affect brain chemistry, which influences intelligence in different ways, within a given environment.<p>Twin studies seem to contradict this. From Wikipedia (heritability of IQ [1])<p>* Identical twins—Reared together .86<p>* Identical twins—Reared apart .76<p>So yes, environment has an impact, but there&#x27;s still a high degree of correlation in intelligence between identical twins raised apart.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ#Correlations_between_IQ_and_degree_of_genetic_relatedness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ#Correlation...</a>",1446490347

I was a sysadmin for a biotech company doing this kind of stuff, and in the end we evaluated fpga/asic and just couldn&#x27;t justify the costs, not just hardware costs but time and barrier to entry costs, such as having to hire more programmers. I also kept a close eye on GPUblast, but it just wasn&#x27;t keeping up with official, and due to pipeline specialties, mostly revolving blasting against all kinds of data, it didn&#x27;t fit the bill. That&#x27;s the main issue, that people doing blasting and related often have very specialized pipelines and different types of data and would almost be required to spend a lot of money to get such a system to work for them. It much less about the speed of the computation than it is about moving the data around. When you start dealing with 100Tb&#x27;s of output a day...<p>What we did end up doing was two things, one, we wrote worker system that basically distributed the computation to almost every computer on the network, and two, I figured out that due to how embarrassingly parallel the computation was, AMD&#x27;s newer opteron chips actually outperformed Intel&#x27;s, and I build some beast servers, and took computation down from average of 1~3 days to ~4hrs. (think 64 actual core&#x27;s via quad cpu motherboards... truly some of my favorite servers I have ever built.) Bottom line is that IO is the main bottleneck, so even things like ROCKS clusters or other distributed systems don&#x27;t work as well as many of the big data people like to think.<p>We also had a very different than normal pipeline mostly revolving around which data to blast against and the methods we used, which were considered the core IP/proprietary, but the real IP was in the analysis.<p>As FPGA&#x27;s, Asics, and GPU&#x27;s make it easier to get the data, you still have to understand it and analyze it, and that is much harder than people understand IMHO.<p>I left for personal reasons, and I&#x27;m still under a non-compete, but I am very thankful for the opportunities I had to learn the bioinformatic&#x27;s side under the eccentric genius I did, and perhaps one day I will turn some of my knowledge into a system that is useful for those wanting to do this kind of work. Also, I will never forget it as the first place I ever got asked to build a petabyte system...<p>For example, IO limitations were mainly centered around accessing large amounts of data that wouldn&#x27;t fit in 128/256Gb of RAM setups, which ended up usually on disks. Even on ZFS/btrfs raid0 ssd&#x27;s, interface limitations were being hit daily..(sata, backplanes, etc) and the recent PCIE-SSD revolution would really be able to make a big dent in that particular issue.",1446489984

One is to buy all the tickets on an event that is expected to sellout immediately.  Another is to find an event that you expect to sellout at some time before the event that will allow enough time for demand to build, and you buy tickets before it sells out.  In the end, ticket prices change over time, therefore there will be a market.  Even if the primary seller (e.g. TicketMaster) raises prices, if you bought at a time when they were cheaper, you can resell at a profit.<p>Event ticketing is a market, and as such there will be people that want to invest (even if it&#x27;s just fans who intended to go and then decided they couldn&#x27;t, or the money they could get for the tickets is too much to pass up).  Scalpers (brokers) provide a service, liquidity.  Often they go too far, and use technology to get tickets in unethical ways (ignoring site policies, bypassing captchas, using software to tie up thousands of tickets they have no intention of buying, etc).  But the fact that they continue to exist is because there is demand (and now TicketMaster is in on the game as well, their TM+ service allows you to resell tickets on their site along-side their own, unsold tickets).",1446489849

When you have thousands of independent genes, then they add up to a normal distribution like the one we see when we measure a lot of people&#x27;s intelligence. The exception is that there are too many retarded people; if the normal distribution was the whole story, then retarded people would be as rare as geniuses, but they are much more common than that. We explain there being too many retarded people by saying that they have one or a few very rare mutations, mutations which are very harmful. But another theory might be that the retarded have very few normal intelligence genes, or that intelligence genes don&#x27;t simply add up but interact in complex ways, or that they have very harmful environments. How do we decide which theory is right? Well, we look at the retarded people vs their siblings; if their parents were lacking a lot of good genes, or they were being raised in a toxic waste dump, then we would expect the siblings to <i>also</i> be near-retarded themselves since they also inherited few good genes or are affected by the toxic waste. But they&#x27;re not; they are almost average! This is more consistent with there being one bad mutation and the retarded sibling had bad luck than the other theories. This theory has since been confirmed by finding hundreds of unique and harmful mutations in retarded people. So we conclude that the effect of intelligence genes is indeed a normal distribution, with an occasional bad mutation overriding that and making someone retarded.<p>This immediately raises a question. If we admit that on the low end intelligence may be controlled by a single rare mutation, why not on the high end too? Maybe there are special genius genes floating around. This would be important because it means that you can&#x27;t make much progress by just looking at the genes of regular people, and it also means that SNP studies will be extremely limited in what they can find. How can we check this? We can do the same thing as on the low end: if there is a special genius gene, then geniuses will have much higher IQ than their siblings do, who will be close to average; but if their parents have lots of good genes and there is no single special gene, then the siblings will also be well above average and similar to their genius sibling.<p>Using a very large set of siblings and twins, OP finds that very intelligent twins/teens <i>are</i> similar to their siblings. So this is the opposite of the retardation findings. There are rare genes for retardation, but there are not rare genes for genius.",1446489196

If you&#x27;re like me, you also notice the utter lack of progress we&#x27;ve made in this area. Pharma has hit or miss symptom management approaches that many cannot afford; once symptoms are noticed, intervention is unlikely to have much of an impact, except to further degrade the quality of life of the patient. We should be aggressive when it comes to new approaches, and I have been closely following studies and the experiences of those who self-experiment. I did trials of vinpocetine, among other nootropics, follow the community, and if a promising compound is released, procure a sample prior to someone patenting it. When my Grandmother was showing signs, I took a course of memantine to help stall with growing ineffectiveness of medication that I relied upn, and also to let the family know about what to expect if they decided to go that route. That was several years ago; they chose not to use meds, and it was too late at that point anyway, as I came to realize upon arrival.<p>BTW, after a week of acclimating, I was pleasantly surprised at the effects offered by that compound. I&#x27;m currently obsessed with certain types of inflammation, and am using a dietary approach, augmented by certain supplements, yoga (oxygen!), socializing, challenging myself (SICP, why not), and meditation (more oxygen! and meta-cognitive benefits to boot - observing changes in cognition is not easy without it, and observations regarding mental status decline from others is hard to accept). I&#x27;m not young enough anymore to believe hype on longecity, e.g., but I&#x27;m not going to discount personal experiences either.<p>One thing to remember about the O2 hypothesis you propose,is that dementia sufferers often do not get sufficient nutrients. The forget how cooking works, what food is, that water should be consumed on a regular basis, develop phobias around food, security, paranoia, and in my case as a temporary (but almost full time) caregiver is showing me the limits of care. In the morning, I systematically walk through the house, open all windows, blinds, remove barricades, turn on all fans, and prepare meals (was a chef in a past life, luckily), ensure the food is labeled, with a note to enjoy, and we cook a meal (I cook, and give out busy-work assignments while the meal is prepared. It is important to do an evening meal and do what you can to make it &quot;fun&quot;; oftentimes that is the best part of the day for someone experiencing cognitive decline. Food is intimately tied to memory, and I notice the effects, especially when incorporating ingredients from her childhood. Ah, I don&#x27;t know... If you are young (I&#x27;m early thirties), now is the time to become an expert. Doctors are not equipped or understandably risk-averse when it comes to dealing  with our new era of elongated morbidity. I&#x27;m getting a tattoo that reads &quot;DNR&quot; somewhere on my torso whe I hit 60. The devastation to family in the case of unclear wishes regarding such matters cannot be overstated. I have been doing this for just under a year, almost burned out twice, and have radically changed  my own life to decrease stress, engage in primary prevention, and live as well as I can.",1446488442

The cube-ships would be ruthlessly harvesting our most shareable lolcat videos, and everyone would be walking around in identical jeans-and-hoodies outfits and calling everything &quot;amazing&quot;.<p>A reboot is really the only way to restore the franchise to its original mission to simplify today&#x27;s social issues and frame them up against the backdrop of a more progressive starfaring society, so that people can get some perspective on those things that might otherwise be too close to home in a somewhat entertaining way.<p>For instance, given the South China Sea situation, I would guess that at some point, the new Star Trek series would introduce some alien species as proxies for China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, and maybe even Brunei, and the China-aliens would be constructing artificial dwarf planets out of hazardous nebulae using unlicensed Genesis devices, and using them as bases to harass passing scientific and mercantile traffic.

TWOK opens with Kirk pondering his own mortality and some of the universal concerns of aging.  ID opens with a Spock apparently deciding to off himself, with no real motivation or development of that decision given. We can quibble about the intervening parts but for my part I find the action and suspense in TWOK much better, and more importantly, logically motivated. What was the point of the entire battle on Q&#x27;onos in ID, other than to just look cool? What sort of character development occured between Kirk and Spock?<p>Finally, we get to the end, and the most egregious difference between the two. In TWOK we get a tense cat and mouse chase through the nebula, which is won, CRUCIALLY, by out-thinking your opponent. The whole &quot;2d thinking&quot; thing and what not.  I admit it&#x27;s probably not the most air-tight of plot points, but it perfectly demonstrates the difference between the two movies, because ID ends with a loud (visually and sonically) fist-fight that is won by the person who punches hardest.  Yay I guess.<p>Anyway, Star Trek is definitely not all sunshine and rainbows but it is crucially several things that the new movies are not: It prioritizes communication and curiousity over violence and dominance. It is not trying to be cynical or &quot;edgy&quot; in an attempt to be mature. The struggle of people working together to overcome a problem and find a positive solution or compromise can and is every bit as exciting as a phaser battle. And finally, that it is fundamentally optimistic, not in a the sort of &quot;magic technology makes everything awesome&quot; way that the new series seems, but that humans can come together and make things better for each other, the no-win scenario does not exist (mostly) and that we have to work hard to make this come true, but it is do-able.",1446487569

I consider myself somewhat moderate where it comes to regulation, though that&#x27;s probably because, as a programmer who hangs out on HN, I interact with a very tech-ish libertarian crowd.  In short, I do see an important role for regulation of industry, housing, and so forth.  I also do tend to agree that a lot of regulations are onerous and harmful, but I don&#x27;t nod in agreement when someone simply says &quot;government&quot; or &quot;regulation&quot;, as if the problem has now been adequately identified and analyzed.  I do prefer that people actually explain what regulations caused this problem and how, and consider what problems might exist in the absence of regulation.<p>So… if you are pointing out that SF has caused a problem with anti-grown measures, I&#x27;d generally agree.  If you are pointing out that that peninsula towns have contributed to this problem, I&#x27;d overwhelming agree, the behavior from places like Mountain View has been pretty shocking.<p>On the other hand, if you are telling me that zoning is obsolete and that the concept of residential neighborhoods in urban areas, where residents of <i>some</i> neighborhoods trade their right to run a hotel out of their house in exchange for for a legally enforced expectation that they won&#x27;t have to live next to a house suddenly converted into a hotel - if you&#x27;re telling me <i>that</i> regulation is the problem, then it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;d agree with you, though I am all ears.",1446487311

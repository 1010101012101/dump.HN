Unit tests catch most of the stupid stuff and plenty of the sophisticated stuff (and are a useful thing to have for a lot of other reasons anyway).

Most of the bugs that resulted in serous production issues for me were a result of rather complex interactions between complex components, not something a debugger would have helped anyone with.<p>That said, I have no doubt that there are a plenty of people who are amazing at writing code in VS and are much better developers than I am.",1314820703

2947259,comment,2945822,2946647,2,0,azakai,,,"> You only run type inference after you detect the hot loops.<p>That is the traditional approach, yes. But it will only get you so far. If you just analyze the current piece of code, you will miss out on a lot of potential optimizations.<p>For example, the types of the variables in the current function may be always of the same type, but without analyzing all the callers you wouldn't notice that - which means you would need to check the type each time you enter. With a more global analysis you could detect that once and be much faster.<p>There are a lot of other optimizations of that sort, like global variables - you can prove statically the type of many of them, just by looking in the whole program.<p>What is cool about this new Type Inference engine is that it is a hybrid approach. It does both local and global, and both static and dynamic analyses. You are very correct that local/dynamic type inference is a known thing, and JITs like TraceMonkey have done a form of it for a long time. But this new engine is something much better.",1314820660

Thanks to the B+Tree ""indexation"" you can do a prefix scan and list folders (e.g. ""ls /home/user/""--> all keys starting  with ""/home/user/"").<p>In the case of e.g. ReiserFS they actually use B+Trees.
They have a caching layer managed by the OS. Most of them have journaling which would be the equivalent of a ""write ahead log"".<p>Map reduce based ""view"" generation can easily be done by pipes and utilities like grep.

Very nice.<p>Asshole consultant inside of me kept nodding early on: ""You just don't get it, Sebastian! Charge more!""<p>You see, there's a very sad truth consultants learn early on: it doesn't matter how much you know that can help somebody. All that matters is how much influence you can have.<p>The reason some consultants charge ten times what others do for the same information? It's not that they are ten times as smart; it's that they don't want to waste their life giving great advice to people who aren't going to value it. If you walk in the door at 10K per day, bet your bottom dollar people are going to listen to you. And that means you can help. Walk in the same door for free, just to help out a friend? Your advice, by definition, is worthless. You'd be lucky getting them to accept just a tiny piece of advice.<p>But then I got to the key of the piece: when you do finally ""get it"", it changes your relationship with ""normal"" folks.<p>I think Sebastian's being a bit over-dramatic here, but I firmly agree. There is something very crazy about making money from thin air. Especially how it's done today, with some keystrokes and a bunch of virtual magic. At least in the old days if you met a millionaire he could take you down to his factory or something. Maybe told you about all the hard work he's done.<p>Nowadays the same type of guy made much more money that than that <i>and there's not even an office.</i> For most people, it just doesn't compute. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that to most people, there's something just <i>wrong</i> about making money the way it's made today on the net. Something shady. If you're lucky you get the ""odd weirdo"" label. If you're unlucky you attract attention from people you would rather not.<p>Because of that, I think I'm giving up on the $40Mil dream. I'm happy just to make enough to free up my time to work on things I love doing. I'll let the other guys be the really extreme weirdos. :)<p>Short side story: I sold a piece of land a year or so ago. It wasn't much, but it was in the tens of thousands of dollars. The guy who bought it paid cash. He was a contractor. Over the past decade he had been saving here and there, scrimping up enough in cash to make his dream come true. He kept it all in hundred-dollar bills in a large ziplock bag. It wouldn't have been my choice but it worked for him.<p>As he paid me, he told me he had gotten stopped for a bad taillight by the police a few months back. Once they saw his money that he had been saving, he had a hell of a time convincing them he wasn't a drug dealer. While I understand that carrying large amounts of cash is suspicious, to hear him tell it the police went far beyond suspicious and started thinking there was definitely something wrong going on. You see, to those small-town cops, you just don't carry that amount of money around. Somebody who looked like that should not have the amount of money like this. Just having the money was an indication of something really bad, even if it could all be explained.<p>He almost lost all of it.<p>You can only stand out so much -- the forces of society will gently (or not so gently) pull you back into line. You either have to conform or move to some place where the definition of ""normal"" is different.",1314819040

I miss them on the tablet side already, which means that messages sent from that device necessarily have a different signature from those sent from my desktop. It's not necessary or even desirable for mail recipients to know I was using one device or another. Some people like to signal that they are on the go with 'sent from my phone' or the like, but I would rather have some basic editing functionality, and this would not be hard to add. On a tablet it's annoying, on the desktop or a laptop where I might need to work offline it's unforgivable. On the up side, this is a good starting point for building an editing/configuration interface that could find its way back towards the tablet space. With wide-format screens the norm nowadays, I was struck by how much more pleasant the panel experience was on my desktop monitor and could see myself switching to this from the page+widgets approach of existing gMail, which is beginning to feel very long in the tooth.<p>This goes double for Google Docs, although it's slightly off-topic. I like working on my tablet a great deal and find I can type surprisingly fast even with the on-screen keyboard as opposed to an external one. But Google Docs on a tablet is so unusable that every manufacturer ships with some open-source office suite to make up for the deficiency.  since Android does not have the same mind/market share as iOS/iPad,  Google needs to offer compelling software alternatives. In many respects it already does so; but productivity tools are noticeable by their absence or abridgement. A minimally-capable version of Google Docs made sense on a smartphone, but on a full-size tablet it's absurdly self-defeating, and inimical to a corporate or academic environment. <i>I would pay for a 'power user' tablet version of core apps like gMail and gDocs. The fact that there is no easy way to leverage forms into an Android clipboard/data-entry interface is a major missed opportunity.</i><p>This really needs to see some movement in tandem with the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich launch. I know both Docs and Android are outside of your remit, but hope you could circulate these concerns in the cafeteria, so to speak.

Until they do, blocking this merger is the best course.<p>Taking the infrastructure into government control is political suicide, no one is going to do it. I'm not interested in giving a protected monopoly without a stronger interpretation of anti-trust law similar to United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.<p>Specifically, a company with a natural monopoly on distribution (wireless, cable, POTS, or fiber telecom companies) should not be able to operate or have exclusivity deals with companies in production or exhibition markets. No Sprint only phones and no Comcast owned television channels, or I'll do everything in my power to at least make sure they have plenty of healthy competitors who can keep them in check, even if it means I pay a premium.",1314817704

Device portability would add real competition to the market, but in reality, AT&T would never agree to that because their whole rationale for the merger is to reduce competition (per the leaked memo).<p>Verizon would also take major issue with this and most likely not allow any such AT&T devices on their network... and if VZW did certify a device, they would only permit the most crippled hardware from AT&T on their network.<p>True competition between the two telco giants is an exciting proposition though, hopefully this is eventually accomplished.

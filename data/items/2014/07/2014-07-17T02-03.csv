8045824,comment,8045510,8045510,1,0,tokenadult,,,"I saw the chart of &quot;more than half a mile from a supermarket,&quot; and I recalled that for as long as I have lived in my current neighborhood (since mid-2001), all my children have known how to walk along with me a mile out and a mile back to shop for groceries and carry them home. I have been doing something more or less like this most of my adult life. Sometimes I would walk for a while before catching a bus home from my grocery shopping, or sometimes share rides with friends who had cars and go on shopping trips together at especially inexpensive discount grocery stores, but whether traveling farther or nearer, I always preferred buying food in grocery stores and preparing it at home to buying fast food. Always. My children have grown up into slim and athletic adults, perhaps because for them eating is something they do after engaging in exercise. Yeah, some places in the United States (and some of those are featured in the article kindly submitted here) are a lot lousier even than the Near North Side of Minneapolis for taking walks outside or for finding any access at all to a grocery store, but for the most part the first thing to change here is the trade-off of how far to travel by what means for what kind of food. That will promote better health, even with very low incomes.",1405565999

8045806,comment,8045510,8045510,3,0,apsec112,,,"&quot;In 2006 the U.S. government replaced “hunger” with the term “food insecure” to describe any household where, sometime during the previous year, people didn’t have enough food to eat. By whatever name, the number of people going hungry has grown dramatically in the U.S., increasing to 48 million by 2012... &quot;<p>There are lots of people in the US in terrible situations, and we should try to help them, but that does not give reporters a license to make up facts. &quot;Food insecurity&quot; <i>does not mean</i> that people are going hungry. It means people who are &quot;at risk of&quot; going hungry, a much broader group. From the Texas Food Bank Network (<a href=""http://tfbn.org/food-insecurity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tfbn.org/food-insecurity/</a>):<p>&quot;What does “food insecure” NOT mean?<p>Food insecurity is not “the government’s definition of hunger.” It is a broader term that captures outright hunger and the coping mechanisms that households use to avoid hunger.<p>Food insecurity is a household situation, not an individual situation. While food insecurity affects everyone in a household, it may affect them differently. Therefore it is not correct to state that specific individuals in a food insecure household (such as children) definitely experience outright hunger or specific coping mechanisms. Rather than describing these individuals as being “food insecure”, they should be referred to as “living in a food insecure home.”<p>Food insecurity is a year-long measure. Therefore, it is not correct to assert that every food insecure household is experiencing food insecurity “right now,” will experience hunger “tonight” or “does not know where their next meal is coming from.” Research shows that food insecurity tends to be episodic and often cyclical.<p>Food insecurity does not mean that a household lacks access to grocery stores, lives in a “food desert,” or does not have time to shop/cook. It only refers to lack of food access based on financial and other material resources.&quot;<p>A much better, but less pageview-generating, term for the problem a large number of Americans face is &quot;malnutrition&quot;. If you are malnourished, you may not be going hungry (and may actually be overweight), but still don&#x27;t get the nutrients you need to be healthy.",1405565678

Perhaps calling it a &quot;tech&quot; company would have been more clear.<p>AWS&#x27;s $3.1B revenue in 2013 would be year 3 of the graph. Everything after that is speculation, but is compared to actual historic data from other companies (without explanation).<p>Several of the other companies lines seem significantly off also. For instance MSFT&#x27;s first billion dollar year was 1990. By year 3 they were making $2.76B, not the just under $2B shown. By year 4 they were showing $3.75B, not the under $3B shown. By year 6, MSFT was making $5.94B, not the $4.5B shown. Similarly, the lines for CRM and VMW are showing lower revenue numbers than the actual ones for the later years. For instance CRM should be $3.72B in year 4, not the $1.75B shown.<p>If you stop the graph at year 3, where actual AWS data stops, AWS has grown only a little bit faster than MSFT. Also, the periods graphed for MSFT, CRM, and VMW all include recessions, whereas AWS is growing during a boom.",1405565451

Material such as in the OP would be some of the best in the book, along with much, much more about girls that boys just have no clue about.  They should have much more than a clue, as boys, when meeting, dating girls, when picking a wife, and certainly when they have one or more daughters.<p>The old norm that boys/men get to ignore such things about girls easily leads to a lot of hurt and harm.<p>The lessons are not very complicated, but they are next to impossible for a boy to discover when following through the usual paths in life.  E.g., I&#x27;ve been a student in five colleges and taught in two more, and I doubt that any of those schools had a course that covered what is in the OP or what would be in my book.  Why?  The norms are, just don&#x27;t explain that stuff, especially to boys/men.  So, get hurt and harm.  Bummer.  Instead, get the info out there.<p>E.g., an approximation to the lesson in the OP is the Erich Fromm remark in his &#x27;The Art of Loving&#x27;.  I paraphrase:<p>For humans, the fundamental problem in life is doing\nsomething effective about feeling alone.<p>This statement is especially true for girls/women.  A man who does not appreciate this statement has some modules between his ears powered down.<p>Fromm went on to say that only four solutions have been found, and one of those was &quot;membership in a group&quot;.  Presto:  That&#x27;s the solution the girls in the OP were working for.<p>Then the father needs to know about two of Fromm&#x27;s other solutions:  One of them is &quot;love of spouse&quot;.  So, such a girl can be very tempted to get a boyfriend, maybe sooner and more &#x27;intimate&#x27; than her father might wish.  Another is &#x27;orgiastic&#x27; behavior, that is, get drunk on alcohol, high on drugs, have an orgy, and, thus, suppress the pains for a few hours at, of course, some costs in addiction, infection, social rejection, etc.  Fathers need to know this, too.  From some news stories, apparently some college girls with &#x27;the hookup culture&#x27; and &#x27;bar scene&#x27; have discovered this solution.<p>This stuff, and more should be taught.  If I write the book, then one thing to do with it, maybe good, would be to have some good Hollywood people dramatize parts of the book, that is, illustrate with facial expressions, tone of voice, body language, scowls, tears, etc.",1405565386

Couple the accompanying fees (?) with pricing structures that are less declarative (food advertised sans tax; tipping expected), and it&#x27;s more difficult to budget.  Further, having/using credit means it&#x27;s always tempting to dip further into it.

All assets depreciate, which is to say they become less valuable over time as they become outdated and suffer wear and tear. Both financial accounting and the tax code recognize this. Depreciation is how the tax code handles investment expenses; if you disallow this, you would be essentially levying extra-heavy taxes on capital-intensive businesses.</i><p>There&#x27;s a big difference between depreciation of your plant and machinery that form a core part of your business and that of luxury purchases for the C-suite. Airlines should certainly be able to depreciate their jets, so should companies like UPS and Fedex that run large air freight operations. So should any business for which flying is part of the business model.<p>But I&#x27;m not convinced that flying executives, investors, and suppliers around in a Lear Jet is essential in the same way.  Rather, that seems like a really nice intangible bonus for the upper management to enjoy. And if firms want to spend money on that and shareholders don&#x27;t object,* then OK - but either tax it as benefits-in-kind or disallow the depreciation.<p>* Not that the views of American shareholders are generally welcomed by management, but that&#x27;s another issue.",1405564052

The global average appears to be about 23.57%.<p>KPMG state that the US corporate income tax is approximately 40% with the following reasoning:<p><i>&quot;The marginal federal corporate income tax rate on the highest income bracket of corporations (currently above USD 18,333,333) is 35%. State and local governments may also impose income taxes ranging from 0% to 12%, the top marginal rates averaging approximately 7.5%. A corporation may deduct its state and local income tax expense when computing its federal taxable income, generally resulting in a net effective rate of approximately 40%. The effective rate may vary significantly depending on the locality in which a corporation conducts business. The United States also has a parallel alternative minimum tax (AMT) system, which is generally characterized by a lower tax rate (20%) but a broader tax base.&quot;</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-res...</a>",1405562900

The browser could crash all it liked, but the system would always be responsive. But now browsers take advantage of all cores, meaning that if they crash, they can block your entire system.<p>I wish there was a way of telling the browser to strictly use only K cores on Windows.

Since this is HN, I'll guess it means becoming a programmer, but you might also mean non-technical startup partner, other entrepreneur, or something else.<p>If you are dreaming of being a programmer but have no programming experience, I'd have to wonder what it is you are dreaming. It's not a glamorous profession when seen from the inside, but if you've been programming for a while and love programming enough to want to do it whether you are paid or not (like me), then it makes sense to try to get paid for it. But you'd have to program for a while before you could know that.<p>I think someone in your position should just find a job, any job that leaves your evenings free--Home Depot is hiring--and try to teach yourself to program every evening after work. Programming is frustrating for quite a while, so don't let it make you feel stupid. Just see if it starts to grow on you eventually or you gradually lose interest. If it grows on you, then start attending in-person meetups, participating in projects online, building things of your own and (later) showing them off, and talking to people you meet about your interest in a programming job somewhere.<p>Continue building skills, relationships, experience, and your resume by being strategic about gaining experience. If you can live with a Home Depot-level salary, you'll probably find small companies that won't care about your lack of college if you don't care that they don't pay much. Big companies like Google or Apple probably won't even talk to someone without either an impressive degree or an impressive list of professional accomplishments. You can eventually come up with the latter if you really do come to love programming, but until then, a bootstrap strategy suggests starting with programming for free (after work), then programming for a small company (that might not pay much), then specializing your skills a bit into whatever area you do best, then working at better (but not giant) companies, then deciding what to do from there.<p>If you find that you hate programming, don't despair. My Silicon Valley plumber makes $140/hr and thinks my programming job sounds like having to do math homework all day long for a lifetime (as if that were a bad thing, go figure), while his is driving around saving people and socializing, running his own company, working whatever hours he feels like...and the grime washes off at the end of the day.",1360237659

It's relatively simple to include a bit of JavaScript on the login page to fetch webfonts for the rest of the app <i>before they are needed</i>.<p>Furthermore, if you use JS to load your webfonts, you can have the site display in ""web safe"" fonts until your custom fonts are loaded.<p>Example: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader#Styles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader#S...</a>",1360237590

Large companies use Windows, and will continue to use Windows for at least the next decade. Fashionable development may have mind share, but corporate practice isn't particularly fashionable. Corporate licenses must make up a huge proportion of office income.<p>Apple's made no real moves to become more corporate friendly in the desktop space (and things like their recent blocking of Java definitely won't help them) and Linux on the corporate desktop is miles away from adoption (some public bodies which did adopt it have moved back to Windows).<p>People talk about the new era of tablet computing, but tablets are pretty much useless for a lot of typing-heavy work. Perhaps eventually a descendant of the tablet (perhaps something like the chromebook) will start to dislodge windows for lighter-weight corporate usage, but I believe it'll be a long time coming.

I would rather see relevant ads than irrelevant ads.<p>I used to work at Microsoft.  I heard second hand that some exec (I believe they said it was Ballmer) in the last couple of years made the decision that Microsoft would make privacy a competitive differentiator.  This sounds great on the surface, but it has lead to seriously unfortunate behavior.<p>For example, I worked on one of the first server manageability products that was completely hosted on the web.  I was really excited to apply what I was learning from HN and the Lean Startup movement to a real online product and not boxed software.  Then reality sunk in when we wanted to implement some very common features like A/B testing, surveys, email open rate tracking, exposure control, et al.  Our legal and privacy teams were highly reluctant to allow us to do these because it could violate Microsoft's stance on privacy.<p>Some of the most memorable arguments were:<p>* ""A/B testing and exposure control are not acceptable for our paying customers.  Every customer must see the exact same version of the software at the same time."" [Would you rather have a bad feature affect 100% of customers or 1% of customers?]<p>* ""Google is getting a lot of bad press for all of the data Chrome sends to Google so we should minimize the amount of data captured and stored from this product."" [I heard this in an official privacy training the same day that Chrome overtook IE in market share. Also, my product was specifically meant to capture lots of data about servers and analyze it for potential problems.]<p>* ""We understand that these practices may be common place at [name any internet company here, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Bingo Card Creator], but we are not them.  You must find a precedent that is set inside Microsoft before we can proceed.""<p>I hope that Microsoft does succeed in making privacy a competitive differentiator, but I feel they lack tact and common sense in many cases.",1360236140

  ads; but, it does mean that the ads you get won't be personalized anymore

  for example, the news articles displayed on MSN and the results you get

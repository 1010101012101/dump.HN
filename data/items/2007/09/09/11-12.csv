We went from nothing to acquisition on $0 of outside investment and essentially $0 of inside investment.  So I am here to say that it is possible.<p>However, there are a number of reasons taking VC money would be ""desirable or necessary.""  Here are some I can think of:<p>1) Good VCs are often hooked into potential acquisition targets.  They can get you noticed and possibly help you fetch a higher price.<p>2) If you need good targeted seed traffic to get you going, that might take a substantial amount of money.  This can take many forms, e.g. a PR firm, adwords, traditional advertising, etc.<p>3) If you have a working customer acquisition channel that requires money, and more money will help you grow faster, you might want to do it just to grow faster, outpace competition, etc.",1189337893

I almost see no way to not believe in AI.<p>As for people not caring: most people don't know how the world ticks, they take for granted that electricity comes from the power socket and food comes from the super market. They will have to care when everything changes (ie their jobs are being taken over by machines).",1189336871

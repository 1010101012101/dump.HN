Sometimes if it feels right you just go ahead and F*ing do it.<p>Otherwise the fear of making a wrong decision will paralyze you into inaction - which is worse than a screw-up (usually). So it is a balancing act - think enough but not too much. Analyze but not to the point of paralysis.<p>Edit: Spelling",1394312398

These census operations were intimately intertwined with technology and cards supplied by IBM&#x27;s German and new Polish subsidiaries, which were awarded specific sales territories in Poland by decision of the New York office following Germany&#x27;s successful Blitzkrieg invasion.&quot;",1394312386

I stored basic information about the M&A targets (approx. revenue, # of employees, etc.) as well as CRM type information (last contacted, relationship owner,etc). I then created a two documents that could be generated based on a unique identifier I had created for each M&A target. The first document was a &quot;one slider&quot; on the prospect. A user could enter the unique identifier of a prospect and what was returned was something that looked like a one slide summary on the prospect created in PowerPoint. I formed the &quot;one slider&quot; by re-sizing all the cells on the spreadsheet to 2 by 2, for design flexibility, and using a combination of vlookups and hlookups to retrieve data. Similarly, the other document produced was a questionnaire that an executive could print out before a meeting with an M&A target so that he/she knew what information we already had on the target and what information we still needed.",1394311886

7366317,comment,7365812,7365812,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting approach, rather than normalize to 1 it normalizes to the largest whole number. The positives of this are that you don&#x27;t run into issues with encoding things like .1 that you do in binary (or any repeating binary fraction), the downside is that you lose precision when you have more than 16 digits of precision. And the of course the complaint most folks will throw at it is that it fails differently depending on what &#x27;end&#x27; of the number you&#x27;re losing precision. The largest decimal number you can represent in 56 bits is 72,057,594,927,935 so the largest decimal number you can represent will any digit value is 9,999,999,999,999 (16 digits), and you have &quot;extra&quot; space at the top (0-6).<p>However, to Doug Crockfords credit, the number space it covers is pretty useful for a lot of different things and in scripted languages and other uses that aren&#x27;t safety related I can see the advantage of an &#x27;fractional integer&#x27; type.<p>Edit: Mike Cowlishaw, who is also quite interested in decimal arithmetic has a much deeper treatment here: <a href=""http://speleotrove.com/decimal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speleotrove.com/decimal/</a>",1394311070

Its also a great example of cargo cult thinking. Law firms see their clients merging and think: we need to get bigger too. Thus, there has been a huge trend in law firm mergers the last couple of decades. Yet, law firms as businesses bear almost no resemblance to the sort of traditional companies that benefit from mergers. There&#x27;s very little economics of scale in a law firm. They have little to no physical capital, and almost all their value is wrapped up in their people, who are only there as long as it suits them.[1] And legal ethics rules penalize larger firms, because they impute conflicts of interest for every lawyer onto the whole firm.<p>The only value to merging beyond a certain size,[2] is for the managers and administrators, who can use the mergers as an opportunity to funnel more profits up to themselves. At Dewey, Di Carmine and the CFO, two non-lawyer administrators, were making over $2 million per year. They also had golden parachutes and clauses saying they could only be fired if they committed crimes. Their justification for all that was of course the role they played in the merger. Its notable that at lockstep firms, where partner pay is based strictly on seniority, and there is not a huge incentive for partners who take on managerial roles, merger mania has not taken hold.<p>The collapse is also a wonderful example of how intelligent people can make dumb decisions based on the narratives they create for themselves. Prior to the merger, LeBouef & Lamb was financially sound, while Dewey Ballantine was facing declining revenues. The folks pushing the merger, Davis and the consultants, painted this narrative of LeBouef merging its way into a prestigious brand, and Dewey shoring itself up with a profitable marriage-partner. Of course in hindsight the narrative was ridiculous. The pedigree of the brand wasn&#x27;t particularly valuable in the end, and LeBouef was not large enough to successfully absorb an ailing firm that was almost as large as itself.<p>[1] Law firms face a more extreme version of the &quot;talent exodus&quot; problem that plagues tech companies. At a firm, almost all of the value of the business is wrapped up in the partners. If they leave, they take their billings with them and your bottom line is in trouble overnight. The top partners might want to stick with the firm through a rough patch, but they have an enormous game-theoretic incentive to jump ship because if the firm does implode, the folks that don&#x27;t leave will be left holding the bag.<p>[2] Practice areas ebb and flow, so you need enough lawyers to support diversified counter-cyclical practices and to be able to cross sell clients internally. The point of diminishing returns for that are probably a quarter of the size Dewey ended up after the merger.",1394310767

I want to be able to bring this problem to the attention of the people performing it, without making it seem that I am accusing them of ill intent.<p>Quite a few people (myself included) are/were of the belief that &quot;discrimination&quot; is the correct term to apply in this context. (To us) the word &quot;discrimination&quot; is a description of effect, not intent. In a technical sense it only means treating two groups differently (it&#x27;s a common term in systems analysis), without implying judgment.<p>Apparently, some people think that the word &quot;discrimination&quot; does imply intent. That&#x27;s fine, words mean different things to different people, and I&#x27;m glad I learn that. But, that leaves me in a bit of a quandary: if discrimination is not the word to use here, than what is?<p>Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards compound terms like &quot;accidental discrimination.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen &quot;indirect discrimination&quot; used elsewhere (as a UK legal term), but I don&#x27;t like that one. If &quot;discrimination&quot; implies motive, adding &quot;indirect&quot; to me implies being sneaky about it as well.",1394309874

The whole concept of a &quot;reference implementation&quot; leads to an entire class of nightmarish problems.<p>What happens if there is an unintentional bug in the reference implementation that causes valid (but incorrect) output for certain inputs? What if feeding it certain input reliably produces a segfault? Does that mean that other implementations should mimic that behavior? What if a patch is issued to the reference implementation that changes the behavior of certain inputs? Is this the same as issuing an amendment to the specification? Does this mean that other implementations now need to change their behavior as well?<p>Or, worse, what if there is certain behavior that should be explicitly left undefined in a proper specification? A reference implementation cannot express this concept - by definition, <i>everything</i> is defined based on the output that the reference implementation provides.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the fact that it takes time and effort to produce a proper specification, and this process usually reveals (to the author) complexities about the problem and edge cases that may not become apparent simply by providing a reference implementation.",1394309603

One was not even a developer.  I hate to give too many details, as litigious as this &quot;beast&quot; (your word, good description) is, but I would say that a very large percentage are just junk/obvious crap.   There are quite a few divisions within IBM and some are obviously very much dedicated to research and high-end engineering (e.g. IBM Almaden).  You would expect patents coming from there.  However, when practitioners in services divisions &quot;reinvent&quot; the wheel on something trivial, document it sufficiently and vaguely enough (especially after it has been through cycles of lawyer-ese) ... and patents are issued, it is laughable.<p>Here is an example of one that is not exactly it (for reason stated above), but similar enough to illustrate absurdity:  Think of a Firefox plug-in that would let you right-click at a certain point on a long web page (e.g. on a word, a highlighted paragraph, anyplace .. that is a couple pages down on a long news article) and choose &quot;Bookmark&quot;.  This would save a &quot;Bookmark&quot; to your toolbar that you could later click and it would not only take you to the web page, but also scroll you to the exact spot you were at before on the page.<p>This type of stupid simple functionality ... would actually be patented by IBM.  Yes .. that functionality had already really existed in one form or another, from multiple methods, yet ... no other company had the absurd gall and audacity to try to actually patent it.   You would now search this patent # on USPTO.gov and read it and be amazed at how absurdly abstract and broad this vague function would be described.  I would guess it would take you 10-15 minutes of reading and deciphering to even begin to realize what it was for (and would be as stupid simple as what I mentioned above).  This is IBM&#x27;s patent machine.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for IBM&#x27;s research divisions, but I know of no quota for other IBM practitioners (say in one of their services divisions).   It is a &quot;badge of honor&quot; in someways (or so they think for some of those folks that submit this stupid crap) as you do have a &quot;Patents&quot; section on the internal profile intranet where it lists if you are a (co)-creator of any patents.

Decimal floating point can accurately represent fractions of the form 1/((2^n)*(5^m)).  Either can only approximate fractions with other prime factors in the denominator (1/3, 1/7, 1/11, ...).<p>In terms of a programmer having to be concerned with accumulated errors due to approximations in the representation, I&#x27;d assert that decimal floating point in no way changes the scope of concerns or approach to numeric  programming compared to binary floating point.  I&#x27;d guess even in a domain with a very precise need of fractional decimals, a programmer would still need to reason about and account for numeric representation errors in decimal floating point such as overflow and underflow.",1394308929

As I recall, the Concorde was something like 30% more than a first class ticket. It&#x27;s hard to imagine such a thing being built in the foreseeable future unless there are radical breakthroughs that totally change air travel economics.<p>As I said elsewhere on the thread, for most people under most circumstances, the main thing is the overall travel experience rather than the number of hours. I don&#x27;t find flying business transpacific all that unpleasant--just boring. And the first class setups for some of the Asian etc. carriers who have 3-class configurations look pretty amazing though I&#x27;ve never experienced them first-hand. The technology and capability exists to make long-haul air travel almost arbitrarily comfortable (and connected).

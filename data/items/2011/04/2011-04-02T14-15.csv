In the US, there's a cult of small class sizes. It frequently seems as if class size itself is taken as a proxy for the quality of the education, to the exclusion of any other factor.<p>But all the literature I've been able to find is inconclusive on the impact of class size -- and the very fact that it's inconclusive should boldly demonstrate that it's not the single, overriding factor. The only thing I can find that seems to be accepted is that smaller classes can help ""at-risk"" generally minority inner-city students who aren't getting educational support at home. But in the general case, nobody's been able to show conclusively that it's got any impact at all.<p>So why do we still make this an end goal rather than a means to an end?",1301756258

It's a big framework and there is a lot there but if this not your first rodeo it's not going to take long to get it. You know what MVC is and rails is just anther (good) web framework with some nice code generation to start you off fast. Oh and that ORM can be handy too!<p>If you are new to Ruby or web dev I would suggest you first start with Sinatra (<a href=""http://www.sinatrarb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sinatrarb.com</a><p>That will give you an idea of what basic basic web dev looks like in ruby without the overhead of a huge framework to take in.<p>After you have a simple hello world running with Sinatra then see about adding an external gem. (Maybe the 'shotgun' gem mentioned on the Sinatra site) then learn about bundler <a href=""http://gembundler.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gembundler.com</a> and get Sinatra running with that setup. Look at the template languages (erb, haml) and play with those. When you find yourself playing with middleware then maybe look at rails and see what it has to offer. At this point you will already have a felling for how everything fits together with a rack based web app (Sinatra and Rails both use Rack) at a little lower level and I think you will have a better experience with rails and be more productive because of it.<p>EDIT: Submissions that have links to articles with questions marks in the title are annoying.

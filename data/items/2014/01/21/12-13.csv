7094938,comment,7091495,7093223,1,0,mbrock,,,"&quot;In this sense programming is like writing a poetry - it must emerge and form in ones mind before it could be written down. The best poetry is written exactly like this - committed to the paper suddenly as it emerges, without any later changes.&quot;<p>Are you sure that&#x27;s true? Can you cite some examples?<p>Lisp is famous for its interactivity: the read-eval-print loop, SLIME, Lisp Machines, Emacs, etc. Avid Lisp hackers even edit code inside of running systems. The &quot;bottom-up approach&quot; to programming (as advocated by Paul Graham) is almost the opposite of what you describe, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Generally speaking, I think both programmers and poets work in a dynamic way with their texts: moving stuff around, seeing what works, doing experiments, asking others, etc.<p>That&#x27;s one reason why Knuth&#x27;s idea of literate programming seems so academic and remote for most programmers: how are you going to keep all of that text up-to-date when you start refactoring?",1390309168

7094936,comment,7091635,7091906,3,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;If the govt said if you get even 1 cent of grant money from us, you can&#x27;t patent your drug. Well .. few researchers will take that money&quot;<p>I doubt that -- researchers do not have many sources of funding available to them.  Grant money basically dictates the direction of research in the majority of fields.  Grants come with all kinds of annoying strings attached (in grad school, I was once paid from a grant that specifically forbade us from purchasing desktops or laptops; we could, however, purchase rack mounted servers) and researchers still take them.<p>What you need to understand is that researchers are usually more interested in padding their CVs than in getting patent rights.  A professor trying to get tenure needs to bring in grant money, publish papers, and graduate some PhD students (who in turn need to be publish papers, etc.).  There is not much room for turning down funding, just like there is not much room for pursuing lines of work that the government is not willing to fund.",1390309137

7094929,comment,7094408,7094408,24,0,tptacek,,,"I don&#x27;t understand this article. Unless its author can predict the future, or knows a lot of things that nobody else in the public knows, they can&#x27;t possibly draw conclusions about exactly what Snowden did.<p>Snowden himself has made it clear that he took documents from NSA <i>en masse</i>, far more documents than have ever been disclosed in the media.<p>How many of those documents have been released to the press? We don&#x27;t know. But what we do know is, of the documents he gave to the press, only a subset have been released. In Greenwald&#x27;s case, that&#x27;s because it was decided that a titrating drip of stories would keep the narrative alive in the media and, not coincidentally, better serve the interests of the publications releasing the stories. In other cases it&#x27;s because journalists have resisted full disclosure out of concern for its propriety.<p>What&#x27;s been done with the zero to a billion documents that haven&#x27;t been provided to the press? Who knows? Have they been encrypted and stuck on the Internet as an insurance policy? Have they been provided to Russian intelligence? Were they stolen from Snowden in an embassy in China? Are they vouchsafed with his acquaintances? Does Wikileaks have them? Nobody knows. Including the author of this blog post.<p>There are places those documents can go that will alter history&#x27;s judgement on Snowden. For instance, if he offered wholesale access to US intelligence secrets to Russia, a country which painstakingly and overtly spies on its own citizens and routinely kills journalists (Barton Gellman is not in hiding in the US, for what it&#x27;s worth), there aren&#x27;t going to be any adoring spreads about him my grandkid&#x27;s history book.<p>You can tell by the questions that jump to my mind what I generally think of Snowden. But nobody who (a) is skeptical of Snowden and (b) posts on Internet message boards could possibly be unaware of how out-on-a-limb that impression must be, because Snowden skepticism invariably whips up a frothy swell of criticism. Unfortunately, the author of this blog post doesn&#x27;t seem to have the benefit of a critical readership; it&#x27;s clear that he hasn&#x27;t actually thought through what&#x27;s happened.",1390309008

That&#x27;s kept me fascinated for at least 3 years, learning macros from Let Over Lambda,  abstractions and FP/OO from SICP, interpreters from PLAI, and syntax from Clojure Programming.<p>I just started learning type theory from F# Programming and Real World Haskell.

Those who were equally if not more successful than Jobs just didn&#x27;t bounce from company to company, but invested their efforts in one place.<p>As to the latter question, I think you&#x27;ll find that there are quite a few people who could lay equal claim to (a) producing that many great products, and (b) having created the products Jobs is credited with.<p>Personally, I think you&#x27;re all overlooking something. The people who work in our industry are by and large professionals. And a professional does what the boss says because that&#x27;s what the salary is for. It&#x27;s not like we get the salary anyway and then do what the boss says if we feel like doing it or think he&#x27;s inspiring enough!<p>So, to give an anecdotal example, when the iPad prototype comes to Jobs and he does that fish tank routine and says &quot;aha- air bubbles, therefore you can still squash it down more&quot;, that&#x27;s just being an arsehole to people who work for you. What, you think they had a dozen prototypes just so the boss could dunk one in water, destroying it? They&#x27;re paid so that if he says &quot;squash it more please&quot;, they go do it. That&#x27;s what engineers do. The teenage drama queen nonsense isn&#x27;t required.<p>And if you believe the arsehole-ness is a necessary thing to be a genius and get things done, you have been watching far too much House for your own good.<p>Honestly, the more you learn about Jobs, the less you see that you&#x27;d hold up to your kids as a role model; whereas the more you learn about Wozniak, the more you see that you&#x27;d hold up.<p>And we&#x27;re still only talking about the technical work; nobody&#x27;s commented yet on the moral issues surrounding the actual manufacture of products like the iPhone.

Mental comparison for you: what&#x27;s the largest agency you count as a client paying you?  Would $250 times the number of accounts they rep be a substantially larger number than that?  They probably make substantially more than that.<p>My brother works at a PPC agency.  Typical client: a company you&#x27;ve never heard of in Chicago which does, without loss of generality, weatherproofing.  They have a PPC budget of $IT_WOULD_BLOW_YOUR_MINDS_HN.  Like many PPC companies, they charge (WLoG) 20% of spend every month.  $250 doesn&#x27;t make that account meaningfully lucrative and if you give them 1 extra conversion a month to brag about it&#x27;s net profitable for the client.<p>I am aware of other marketing software companies which get into very cozy relationships with their favorite marketing agencies, to the tune of four to five figure checks monthly.  That would, presumably, lift your average from $70 to an even happier number.<p>Bonus points: if you do it right, you can pitch this as a straight moneymaker to the agency, on some model like &quot;You add a line-item to all your invoices of +$500 for $FOO_SOFT, so after we get our cut, that&#x27;s $12,500 that your agency grosses which is <i>totally free money</i> to you.&quot;",1390307030

But the few times you do like the new tech, you might expand your options to whole new horizons.<p>Currently I&#x27;ve learned:<p>- TI Basic (when I was very young, for the TI-99/4a)<p>- LotusScript (ancient tech, yay!)<p>- Visual Basic (the horror!)<p>- Objective-C (cool language)<p>- C# (sweet language)<p>- Java (yuck! - the crappy version of C#)<p>- a bit of HTML / JavaScript (hate browser differences)<p>- Python (pretty nice language, except for the indent requirements)<p>- Django (pretty cool framework, but eventually didn&#x27;t &quot;click&quot; with me)<p>- C (cool language due to very small library, still need to figure out some pet project to use it on).<p>- Xamarin (very nice to build iOS / Android / WinPhone apps with 1 language but still optimised UI per platform)<p>- SQL (I know enough to get around databases, but don&#x27;t particularly enjoy this)<p>Hoping to pick up Lua in the future, perhaps in combination with a C or Objective-C program. Dabbled a bit in OpenGL, would like to make a real game with it one day, not just the very lame Pong clone I created.<p>If you don&#x27;t enjoy learning new stuff, better move out of software development I think. Cause you won&#x27;t invest your free time which means you&#x27;ll get behind on other software developers who take their job more seriously. This in turn might make you much harder to employ.<p>Also: put stuff out on Github, be active on StackOverflow. Since I&#x27;ve put several (mainly abandoned) products om my Github this week, it seems a lot more recruiters have shown an interest in me. Though maybe it&#x27;s just coincidence, I&#x27;ll have to see how it works out in the long term ...

Those pays everything from 20 cent to couple of bucks per download.<p>App runs barely any hosting cost, and this generates a nice little passive income. I have an admin panel to turn on more ads, but as of now I would rather grow with as little intrusive ads as possible. When, and if I turn on more intrusive ads, users can purchase a &quot;pro badge&quot; to get rid of ads. (turned off now).<p>Best side effect is that I have gotten a LOT better at obj-c development since I started playing with it, and now run a small mobile development company that actually pays the bills.

So there&#x27;s basically no work to do other than cleaning the bedsheets, which I do as part of cleaning my bedsheets anyway... I do this for a maximum of 1week/month, which gets me roughly £4000/year and since it&#x27;s tax exempt in Scotland (under lodger laws), it&#x27;s the easiest money I&#x27;ve ever made.",1390305991

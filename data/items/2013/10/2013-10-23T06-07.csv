Before there was Microsoft, there was IBM (Apple and MS started at the same time, roughly). Before that, there were no PC clones, only sanctioned hardware running sanctioned software, all with big fat IBM support contracts. Even Apple practiced this, very closed-source proprietary; Microsoft was actually the &quot;open&quot; alternative back then (Stallman was probably playing around with PDPs, very much proprietary uncloneable hardware systems that came with an open Unix).<p>Then Microsoft comes along and disrupted the entire industry. How? By shipping an operating system for commodity hardware that could easily and cheaply be cloned (IBM&#x27;s accidental doing as they needed to ship the PC quickly). This happened in the early 80s, which occurred before the 90s.<p>> Fortunately, the situation these days is much better than in the 90s since now there are real alternatives. What was once hatred is now just suspicion.<p>Fortunately, the situation these days is much better than in the 90s since now there are real alternatives (DELL, Compaq, Gateway).

This is a common issue on many forums.<p>Anti-X sentiment takes a lot less effort than writing a cogent pro-X message supporting something, and everything has it&#x27;s pro- and anti- crowd. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of posters complain that this, and other forums are anti-Apple, anti-Linux or anti-Microsoft when in fact there&#x27;s a fairly healthy mix of opinion.<p>Maybe there is a trend against Microsoft in the news and forum world though. It doesn&#x27;t seem all that long ago that most tech news and most interesting tech articles were about Microsoft products and technologies. Maybe that&#x27;s still the case and I&#x27;m living under a rock, I doubt it because I still use mostly Microsoft platforms at work but it&#x27;s possible, but there just doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that much new and interesting stuff coming out of Microsoft these days. It&#x27;s fairly rare that anything by them moves the needle in terms of tech punditry. They need to radically increase the value proposition of Windows and Metro just doesn&#x27;t cut it.

6597203,comment,6596018,6597127,2,0,mbell,,,"Most consumer routers actually work fairly well as APs. Once you&#x27;ve turned off all the routing functionality, which are the most complex and resource intensive bits, they seems to actually be pretty stable.  I&#x27;m currently using an Asus RT-AC66U, which is complete overkill, but I wanted reliable AC wifi and it was the best option at the time.  Prior to that I was using an Asus EA-N66R AP.<p>As for how this relates to the exploit discussed here, your only using it as an AP, you&#x27;ll very rarely need to login after the first setup since it really isn&#x27;t doing much, just Wifi <-> Ethernet bridging. If using a consumer router the WAN port isn&#x27;t connected to anything, no outside access to worry about (unless you did some funky forwarding on the pfsense box). You should also disable management via Wifi. That limits any access to a wired connection to the network, meaning someone is already in your apartment to physically patch in with an ethernet cable.  Any security bets are off at that point.  If you want super extra special security you can setup firewall rules on the pfsense box that only make the AP&#x27;s IP address accessible from a particular port.<p>As dumb as this exploit is on the part of netgear, remember that to exploit it the attacker had to have already broken the WPA2 security to access the wifi or physically plugged in with ethernet. The first vector can be avoided by simply turning off management via wifi.",1382508665

6597200,comment,6578749,6578749,1,0,mimilee,,,"Heatoe&#x27;s Fourth Article Published.<p>Title: You Found A Condom In Your Daughters Purse? What Harm Reduction?<p>Mother, suppose you found a condom in your teen-aged daughters purse? How would you feel? What would you say? What would you do?
It is likely that you would be shocked to find evidence that your daughter is, or at least is prepared to be, sexually active. You would worry. You would be concerned about your daughters reputation. But more than anything, you would be worried about her safety. There are many dangers lurking for sexually active teen-age girls.
But as a mother you will probably have already sensed that your daughter was at least thinking about sex. And if you found a condom in her purse, beyond feeling shocked, you might feel some relief. You will have learned that your daughter is proactive in protecting herself. Because of all the dangers out there for sexually active young people, the most important are the risk of unwanted pregnancy, and the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), especially AIDS or HIV.
Maybe the fact that your daughter is carrying a condom will start you worrying about what kind of friends she has. But if your daughters friends worry you, isnt that all the more reason that she should protect herself by carrying a condom?
Modern public health thinking is guided by the principle of harm reduction. The idea is to reduce the harm that comes from behaviors which are inherently risky, even those which are viewed by many as immoral, or which are even illegal. The behaviors include use of alcohol or recreational drugs, patronizing prostitutes, and engaging in pre-marital (or extra-marital) sex. Where some people draw on teachings of morality and try to ban or prohibit those behaviors, people who are guided by the principle of harm reduction try above all to protect our children, our friends, and others from harm. Those who believe in harm reduction are just as moral as those who want to ban what they see as bad behavior. But the principle of harm reduction is based partly on a recognition that attempts at prohibition often dont work at all. 
Abstinence only and Just say no campaigns have been unsuccessful. Harm reduction programs work.
Would you tell your daughter, Dont carry a condom. I forbid you to to carry a condom? That idea is frightening, isnt it? You wouldnt really say that. You wouldnt deny her protection. Maybe the only thing worse than the thought of your daughter carrying a condom is the thought of her needing a condom and not having one.
Instead, you should sit and talk to your daughter about the dangers of sexual activity, especially of promiscuity. You should talk to her about her life and about her friends. You should advise her. But you would not expose her to risk. You would not deny her harm reduction.
If the condom in your daughters purse is conspicuous, perhaps you should tell her to make it less visible, possibly by using a condom compact. Another form of harm reduction is to avoid embarrassment and a possible bad reputation by concealing ones condoms in a condom compact. 
Maybe its time that you, her mother, should start thinking about carrying a condom too. Protect yourself. You cant always rely on others to do it for you.",1382508483

They worked out of a garage and finished in less than 4 months.<p>The code others are speculating about is the backend enterprise application, written by an entirely different company, CGI Federal, that runs the marketplace portion of the site.

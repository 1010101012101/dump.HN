More and more I'm thinking the latter.  Perhaps I need to disconnect myself from the internet for a while :-)",1237603830

And the worst thing is that I work, read, study & sometimes even eat on my bed. I'm not at my home there's very little room to make big changes with.

525886,comment,525625,525797,0,0,spot,,,"1) I am sorry that you have been misinformed.  The only genomes I ever pulled was a group of about 6 about 4 years ago, a group that I selected exhaustively from about 100000 myself to make large format prints.  And the archive pages for those sheep still stand, including their ancestry.  I don't know why your friend thinks otherwise, but I'm sure it's a simple miscommunication.  If you can point at the ""hole"" in the archives, I would be more than happy to take a look at it.<p>2) My work at Google has nothing to do with it.  If anything my time is worth more now because I am so much more busy.<p>3) You are right I have to be extremely careful.  And I have been, and my user base is quite happy as a result, both voters and designers.  My big problem is server overload.  We just did a survey and of the 836 respondents, 98% would recommend Electric Sheep to their friends, and only a fraction of a percent objected to me making money from it (""making"" is a dream, for now I just want to recoup my investment).  Nearly everyone recognizes that I have and continue to put an inordinate amount of time effort and money into this.  Donations have spiked with the traffic I have received from this announcement.  Because people love it and they support me.<p>I hope you will reconsider.<p>Thank you, -sp0t",1237603297

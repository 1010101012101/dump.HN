That makes for an incredibly flexible system if you&#x27;re willing to put in the leg work, but at the end of the day I wasn&#x27;t seeing a lot of value add from knowing that 24% of my spending was on travel or that I exceeded my average monthly spending on gifts by 215%. The biggest benefit for me was just seeing all of my transactions in one place (fwiw, I used Mint for 6 years).<p>With Penny, you have fast access to all of your transactions in one place (the left pane is a history screen), and you can categorize them into one of five categories. But, the main value add is giving you context on that spending. Graphs are great, but graphs that are interpreted in a meaningful way are better. Essentially, the bigger vision is to do for finances what Google Now is doing for day to day life: pushing you useful information (now cards, or in our case conversations with Penny) rather than you having to ask for it.<p>That said, we know it&#x27;s a huge ask to convince people to try something new when it comes to their finances, so totally understand where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>btw, to clarify: when you go to the website you should be seeing animations unless you&#x27;re coming from iOS 7.

9942863,comment,9940469,9942614,0,0,koliber,,,"Well said. What needs to be considered also is that a manager may have different types of negative feedback. He may have major issues, which would be strange to hold on to until the annual review. However, there may also be a bunch of smaller pieces of criticism, which will fall under a particular threshold and will be held back, either entirely, or until an opportunity for a review arises. That opportunity may be a long ways away.<p>The trick is having constant feedback. Weekly, bi-weekly, or even monthly review-like events allow both the employer and employee to share wins and discuss areas of friction. Having lots of such mini-reviews allows for quicker resolution and prevents things from boiling up.<p>Fantastic managers do this intuitively and do not need instruction or tools for it.",1437753519

Instead I had a recursive function that worked from the entered cell to:<p>-- parsed a string DSL of &quot;=sum(B4:B8)&quot; into a javascript function, that pulls some premade functions like sum, vlookup etc, and makes a string list representing what an arguments getter will need to fetch (&quot;a_r3c1_r7c1&quot; ie array, row 3, col 1 to row 7 col 1). The user still just sees &quot;=sum(B4:B8)&quot;<p>-- note who &quot;I depend on&quot;,<p>-- note who &quot;depends on me&quot;<p>-- recurse &#x27;outwards&#x27;, skipping cells in &quot;depends on me&quot; that are still waiting on &#x27;needs recalc&#x27; of their own &quot;I depend on&quot;.<p>The update algorithm is not the hard part. Microsoft also has a very detailed documentation of their own update algorithm online (cant find it at the moment though).<p>The hardest part was updating the string representations of the formulas when you insert a new column or row, and then re-updating each cell&#x27;s dependencies arrays.<p>Definitely not a performance problem, but more of a &quot;how the fuck do I wrap my head around all the different ways someone could want to insert, cut, copy and paster here&quot;.<p>One mistake I made was trying to impliment the undo/redo to be totally reversable at every step. So every command stores the way to go both back and forward. In hindsight, I should have just stored forward commands and rebaked from the beginning when someone wanted to go back in time.<p>I wish I had more time to work on the project, but I&#x27;ve been busy with other work.<p>notes:

That library has some major design flaws. We used it in our git style version controlled spreadsheet app (<a href=""http://www.gridhub.xyx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridhub.xyx</a>). Handsontable only takes simple &#x27;number&#x27; or &#x27;string&#x27; value for each cell. It should have been an object that could store CSS for that cell, formula for that cell, and the value for that cell. I made a few pull requests, but they largely ignored me.

9942837,comment,9941712,9941712,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"If we want to have a meaningful discussion about sexism in tech, it&#x27;s time to talk about what we&#x27;re up against, and it involves all of us: not just women and minorities. If it doesn&#x27;t involve us now, it will in 20 years when we&#x27;re two decades older, because ageism is just as much of a problem in the tech industry as the other &quot;isms&quot;.<p>There isn&#x27;t an above-baseline sexism among long-term professional programmers. Sure, there are bad apples, but the culture that you&#x27;ll find at a gray-haired research lab or even a more traditional, supposedly conservative, enterprise shop is not nearly as exclusionary as the supposedly progressive and new Silicon Valley culture.<p>By stereotype, you&#x27;d expect 60-year-old men writing elevator controllers in Indiana to be far more sexist and exclusionary than 25-year-olds in California. It ain&#x27;t true. First of all, someone who&#x27;s 60 now was born in 1955 and has no meaningful memories of the bad old days; by the time he or she was starting a career, women were already in the workforce and it was accepted by many as a good thing. Second, if you control for education, the age vs. exclusionary behavior correlation goes away. Third, most people actually get more mature with age, and while there are some who mature at a lesser rate than society advances and become the &quot;racist grandparent&quot; trope, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s the norm. (Also, American society&#x27;s rate of advancement has slowed in the past 30 years compared to the 30 before that, but that&#x27;s another topic.) Fourth, anyone who thinks the dominant Silicon Valley culture is still liberal has been asleep for 20 years.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that private sector tech doesn&#x27;t have a sexist, exclusionary culture. It does. It doesn&#x27;t come <i>from the programmers</i> (although there are individual programmers who are assholes and keep it going). Rather, it comes from <i>the mainstream business culture</i> (MBA culture) that colonized us. In fact, the sexism of the Damasos (see: <a href=""https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/vc-istan-8-the-damaso-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/vc-istan-8-t...</a> ) who are sent West to boss nerds around is a lot more severe than that of the mainstream MBA culture. Banks might make it harder for women to advance; venture capitalists, on the other hand, will outright hit on them and threaten to &quot;pick up a phone&quot; and make them unfundable if they don&#x27;t acquiesce.<p>You know how when a criminal gang kicks out some of its underperforming members and they form a new gang, the upstart young gang is typically more violent than the one it splintered off from? The sexism of the VC bros and the Spiegel types they fund is analogous. The demigods of the Valley are people who got kicked out of mainstream business culture because they weren&#x27;t smart enough to do statistical arbitrage at hedge funds, so they were sent West to man this colonial outpost (from the MBA-culture perspective) called Silicon Valley. As MBA-culture failures, it&#x27;s not surprising that they amplify some of that culture&#x27;s worst traits, and that they&#x27;ve created a dominant culture in Silicon Valley that is (a) very negative and (b) far worse than the more superficially conservative (no sandals at work) but generally professional culture you see in more traditional companies, including the ones doing (say) hardware work and low-level programming, the latter of which seems to be the OP&#x27;s interest.<p>She had a positive experience because she was hanging around Real Technologists, who aren&#x27;t nearly as sexist as the Silicon Valley wunderkinder. The Shanleys of the world aren&#x27;t complaining about 55-year-old men who still say &quot;Oriental&quot; (meaning no harm, and not holding racist views) but are generally professional and not very sexist (many are married and have daughters). They&#x27;re complaining about 22-year-olds who get funded to the gills because they were in the same rape frat as a leading VC, and who go on to create horrible work cultures.",1437753324

Even without the dignity of equal power, women have believed in the redeeming potential of love. There has been—despite the cruelty of exploitation and forced sex—a consistent vision for women of a sexuality based on a harmony that is both sensual and possible… These visions of a humane sensuality based in equality are in the aspirations of women; and even the nightmare of sexual inferiority does not seem to kill them.

But you did it!<p>- Almost every developer was converted to .NET to work there, because Microsoft&#x27;s credibility among startup-focused developers is not great outside of a few specific tools like SQL Server. It&#x27;s a lot easier to get enough hands to get the job done when you let them use Node (which, I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t even really like, I&#x27;d personally rather write C# but I don&#x27;t write application code here so it doesn&#x27;t matter) instead of <i>making</i> them write C#.<p>- The legacy stuff isn&#x27;t being rewritten. It&#x27;s going to be ported to Linux, using Microsoft&#x27;s own CoreCLR. Parts will be broken out into their own services in order to directly scale them and make it easier to provide separation of concerns; whether it gets rewritten or just parted out is an engineering decision, but so far they seem content to part out legacy code instead of rewrite.<p>- I&#x27;m a DevOps guy. I automate. And you can automate a lot more, to go a lot faster, in a Linux environment. Chef&#x27;s made strides in Windows, and that&#x27;s honestly and truly cool, but it&#x27;s only a first step. There&#x27;s a reason that most devops folks I know have settled on disposable architectures, where a config change means that the machine should be canned: it reduces ambiguity by removing convergence in favor of guaranteed state. This is <i>extremely difficult</i> in Windows because of the amount of drag induced by the tooling. It takes literally-literally twice as long to bake a Windows Vagrant box as it does a Linux one--I&#x27;ve timed it. It takes longer to build a Windows AMI. It takes longer to deploy one, making your auto-scaling groups less responsive.<p>-This company&#x27;s load patterns are unpredictable enough and spiky enough that there is an actual, no-bullshit need for scaling on the order of seconds, not 5-10 minutes, and you literally <i>can&#x27;t</i> do that in AWS with Windows (and I don&#x27;t think you can with Azure, either); containerization technology (ECS, Mesos, whatever) is making it very practical to meet these sorts of response requirements.<p>- Languages must be approved; right now it&#x27;s just Node and Mono (soon to be CoreCLR), but the build environments (both through Chef and, later, through Docker) support multiple languages. To use something else, one will have to make their case. But instead of assuming a certain level of professional rigor, you started frothing and assuming everything would be written in whatever struck somebody&#x27;s fancy.<p>Seriously: fanboy harder.

They are far removed from Korean culture, it&#x27;s the fact that Japan doesn&#x27;t give citizenship to what it considers impure blood yet at the same time, if you are half Japanese, you are eligible. What does this say about Japanese society? There&#x27;s a deep rooted institutional level of racism. I&#x27;m sure those that have lived in Japan will know of this ceiling.<p>What&#x27;s remarkable about Masayoshi is that despite the odds being against him, he pulled so far ahead of what an average Japanese could achieve. One of his earliest childhood adversity is some Japanese kid threw a rock at him for being Korean yet with no repercussions for such hate crimes.<p>Looking at Japan, celebrities and businessman of Korean descent but nowhere are they considered to be Korean in Korea unless they speak the language and appear on Korean variety shows (like Korean-Japanese UFC fighter and Judo master Yoshihiro Akiyama), and they seem to be treated like shit in Japan. It&#x27;s no surprise that even Yakuza membership have lot of Koreans given the poor level of opportunities available to them in Japan.",1437752764

Unless you have a <i>lot</i> of cores, my general experience is that you need sequential performance first and only then can you think about achieving speedups from going multicore. Compiler optimizations matter even more on ARM than on x86 due to shorter pipelines, smaller caches, super-expensive synchronization primitives, and so forth.<p>Of course, to be fair to Go, the primary alternative is Java (though the performance-critical parts of Android tend to be written in C++), which as implemented in Android doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot of optimization either.<p>I think Go could be a great choice for application development, mind you.

A woman has a body that is penetrated in intercourse: permeable, its corporeal solidness a lie. The discourse of male truth --literature, science, philosophy, pornography-- calls that penetration violation. This it does with some consistency and some confidence. Violation is a synonym for intercourse. At the same time, the penetration is taken to be a use, not an abuse; a normal use; it is appropriate to enter her, to push into (&quot;violate&quot;) the boundaries of her body. She is human, of course, but by a standard that does not include physical privacy. She is, in fact, human by a standard that precludes physical privacy, since to keep a man out altogether and for a lifetime is deviant in the extreme, a psychopathology, a repudiation of the way in which she is expected to manifest her humanity.",1437752204

Since (B) happens so frequently, this means many parts of every system are harmful precisely because the system isn&#x27;t perfect yet (and every part can be minorly adjusted so long as other parts of the system are adjusted - and this latter part is never discussed (probably because the complexity involved is actually complex and someone else would be like &#x27;dude, that&#x27;s also harmful - your solution has side effects&#x27;))).<p>If it was easy to implement new things people would do that instead of complaining.

A ranking process that buckets employees into performance categories allows you to determine the company-wide increase in salaries and the bonus pool first and work backwards to arrive at each employee&#x27;s raise/bonus. And since bonuses are usually timed with the end of the fiscal year, that increase (or lack thereof) can be based entirely on the numbers they deliver to investors.<p>Also, by forcing a relative appraisal of each employees performance, you force managers to view employees with a more critical eye. If I were to simply have to answer, &quot;did X do a good job on this project?&quot;, my answer would almost always be yes, absent any incentive to say no. But there are members of my team who deliver significantly better than others, so the calibration process forces me to find a way to put them above the team members who perform at a lower level. Getting rid of performance reviews would, from what I&#x27;ve seen, create a culture of &quot;don&#x27;t screw up&quot; rather than one of taking risks and trying to do as well as possible.<p>As a manager who both received an annual performance review and delivered 10 of them in the past week (our FY15 ends 7/31), I hate the process more than most people. But I think this discussion is ignoring the advantages just because we all hate the process. We run the risk of creating a whole new process that we hate just as much as the old process. Because it all boils down to finding an impartial way to evaluate performance and, unless you can crack that nut, your process isn&#x27;t going to work. Top performers will move on and you&#x27;ll be left with only under-performers. And that&#x27;s because humans naturally evaluate their circumstances relatively rather than absolutely, once you get beyond the basics (i.e. can I pay rent and bills). Someone making $100k/yr is going to feel underpaid if someone they feel they&#x27;re better than makes more. Just because the current system for ranking is flawed doesn&#x27;t mean that there doesn&#x27;t mean that ranking isn&#x27;t necessary.",1437751098

Astigmatism with soft contacts means toric lenses, which have a few annoying &quot;quirks&quot;.  First, they never quite fully correct most astigmatism because the corrections are quantized in a way that makes it difficult to get a bang-on correction.  Second, they lose acuity if the wearer&#x27;s head is tilted.  Both of these flaws relate to how toric lenses work: they&#x27;re weighted to maintain their orientation.  They&#x27;re only in correct position when your head is straight up-and-down.  Tilt your head a bit and they start to float off line.  The worse your astigmatism, the more annoying these deviations become.  As such, when I&#x27;m in for an eye exam no one recommends soft lenses for me anymore.<p>That leaves modern rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses.  I don&#x27;t mind the feel of wearing these, and the vision is <i>excellent</i>.  They don&#x27;t need weighting for correct orientation, which eliminates the aforementioned limitations of soft lenses.  The visual acuity for my correction is in all ways superior to soft lenses I&#x27;ve tried.  The central vision nearly rivals good glasses, and the sharp peripheral vision blows glasses out of the water.  But even with the newest, most permeable lens materials my eyes can&#x27;t really ramp up to tolerating them for a full day&#x27;s wear.  And there&#x27;s the rub, since RGPs require a ramp up to acclimate to wearing them, they aren&#x27;t really amenable to just popping them in &quot;weekend warrior&quot; style.<p>I haven&#x27;t taken the LASIK plunge yet, but the above might illuminate why it&#x27;s an appealing option for some people.",1437751057

The total numbers of Bitcoins that will ever be mined is finite but miners will have to pay their electricity bills forever (or at least until Bitcoin ceases to exist). The only way that miners could cover their costs would be that the price of Bitcoins goes to infinity which is of course a bad thing. And a Bitcoin is mined only once but can be transacted an unbounded number of times. The costs occur at every transaction because transactions require the Bitcoin network and therefore you have to pay for transactions.

9942448,comment,9940910,9940910,0,0,sqldba,,,"We had this &quot;problem&quot; at two of my workplaces; one where I was the one doing it and the other where someone else was doing it.<p>In my case I lived nearby but sometimes was 5-10 minutes late despite having moved to live literally 5 minutes walk away. Why was I coming in late? Because while my direct coworkers and manager were amazing, we had been acquired by an evil company, and being ordered by senior management (from the safety of another state) to treat customers without human decency.<p>The only way I could continue to work, aside from the feeling that I was in the belly of the beast and secretly helping all the customers that I could, was that I was in control of that 5-10 minutes in the morning. I was the one doing it, they weren&#x27;t doing it to me.<p>After some poking and prodding my boss decided it was not a big deal. Yes the phones had to be answered, but it wasn&#x27;t an issue when a few people were likely in the office, they can call back a minute later and have someone, and my mobile number was also published for outside of hours contact. No big deal, no internet post, no ego, no whinging.<p>At another company an employee was even more late; 30-60 minutes every day. I wasn&#x27;t privy to the conversations about why (I think it was just more convenient because they had kids and both partners worked) but the boss had a talk with them and changed their working hours to start at 9:30. Again, the phones have to be answered, but it&#x27;s also useful to have someone who stays later in the day. No big deal, no internet post, no ego, no whinging.<p>Do you see the pattern here? An employer and employee talking about something, realising they both want different things, and deciding well it&#x27;s worth it to retain the talent. The idea of a manager and their bruised ego trying to force everyone to fall into line as if workers were cattle is disgusting.<p>What amazes me from the post is the number of managers (or manager wannabes) who insist that the employees are either insulting them, insulting co-workers, refusing orders, or failing to meet a contract.<p>* I can guarantee at every company, anyone with kids, comes late at some times and leaves early to pick the kids up. Nobody bats an eye.<p>* Coming late has nothing to do with you, the company, or the job. Some people just work this way and you can judge them on the work or be pig-headed and lose their talents. (There may be a slight correlation to being a bad boss and having employees come in late because they hate dealing with you.)<p>* As for not fulfilling a contract, if your lawn gets mowed once a week, or the paper or milk is delivered, or you&#x27;re in the doctor or dentist&#x27;s waiting room and they&#x27;re ten minutes late - try refusing the bill and tell me how it goes. Good luck.<p>* You may write a cheque but you will never own a person and get to push them around however you like. Let them go if you must. But if doing so doesn&#x27;t strongly benefit the business to the tune of the tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars of investment it costs to retain an employee - versus ten minutes a day - then if you do it you&#x27;re just a bad manager.",1437750177

First reason is that this would block criticism within feminism, such as the one made in the post.<p>Second reason is that women aren&#x27;t all equal, women don&#x27;t all have the same problems, so if feminism embraces the sorority concept, it would lead to minorities&#x27; issues just getting ignored, i.e. no one would care about autistic women. So, it&#x27;s not that feminism isn&#x27;t for women, but women do have their differences and they need to deal with that.<p>Lastly, feminism isn&#x27;t about being against men. Sure, some radical feminists are against men, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re taken seriously. Actually, there is a debate among feminists about whether men should or not be allowed to engage in feminism, and there are plenty who think they should.

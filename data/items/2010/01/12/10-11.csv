1047262,comment,1045758,1047231,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"<i>One</i> reed only! (Soprano, alto and baritone saxes -- never got along with a tenor for some reason, even with a ""doubler's"" mouthpiece -- and clarinet.) Or no reed (flute, piccolo, tin whistle, zampona -- even did a wee tune on an upended Royal Doulton figurine once at a gig for a lark). It's not that two reeds are fundamentally bad, but the lack of exhalation with the oboe gets real old real fast, and the twit who decided that a <i>thumb</i> should be the source of all power (bassoon) ought to have been shot before it was too late.",1263293979

1047260,comment,1047077,1047077,0,0,samstokes,,,"""The idea behind the book, nutty as it might seem, is to teach assembly language as your <i>first</i> programming language.""<p>This is a really interesting idea.<p>In the debate over whether every programmer should still learn C, a common argument for is ""managed languages don't teach you about pointers and memory"".  Learning assembler would surely do that even better than learning C (albeit probably less practically useful overall).  I can't decide whether that's a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> for the pro-C argument, or support for this book's thesis.",1263293661
1047258,comment,1047238,1047238,0,0,mixmax,,,"Based on your posts here and your blog, if I look at what I would want to use that expertise for in my company it would be something different. You have an experience in tech and entrepreneurship that is one in a thousand, and that shouldn't be wasted on helping companies doing powerpoints. I would much rather want you as a boardmember/advisor. This would give a company two distinct advantages:<p>1) An extremely knowledgeable person who has been there before with which to talk on complicated issues. Experience in startups is rare as you point out. When it is coupled with deep tech knowledge it's even rarer.<p>2) Your name on the businessplan/presentation. Namedropping seems to be a major thing with investors. Unfortunately.<p>Also, companies that are out raising money often aren't good customers as patio11 points out. Besides there's no repeat business, meaning that you'll have to constantly be on the lookout for new customers. Equity payment is great, but it's a lottery ticket. I don't know your personal situation of course, but if you need bread on the table it's probably going to be hard.<p>But I'm sure lots of companies would pay in either equity/cash to have you onboard as an advisor. I know I would.",1263293551

We may be assigned a project that we know nothing about. We may have to use a new tool or environment. We may be working with people who can seem intimidating. The natural temptation is to retreat to a place of safety, but that wonâ€™t get the job done.

1047242,comment,1046948,1047003,0,0,mock,,,"While I agree that being an asshole is more frequently harmful than helpful, I don't think the behaviour in question here is actually assholic in nature.  Every community needs to have a way of enforcing community values or that community will dissolve.  That enforcement can be a police officer, a drill sergeant, a moderator, or just a loud mouthed member of the community that expresses the group's scorn for the behaviour in question.<p>What is important is that everyone who witnesses the policeman deliver a lecture to delinquent teens, the sergeant chew out a new recruit, the moderator remove a troll or flamebait, or the loud mouth deliver an invective laced screed to the newbie who just doesn't get it, gets the message that ""certain behaviours aren't tolerated here"" and by extension, other (more polite) behaviours are.<p>When the policeman gives you the nod on the street corner on your way to work, when the sergeant says, ""Nice work"", when the moderator uses something you wrote as an example of what a good post looks like, or when the community loudmouth bastard says ""SHUT UP AND PAY ATTENTION TO HIM"" and you realize he's talking about you - that's the point when you realize you're part of the community.",1263292356
1047240,comment,1047117,1047141,0,0,dkersten,,,"IMHO Clojures steeper learning curve comes from having more features built right into the language. Scheme is refreshingly simple, but Clojure gives me so much more, right out of the box: instead of being based around lists, as Scheme and Common Lisp are, Clojure is based on <i>sequences</i> (which are really just an abstraction over lists, vectors, maps, sets and regexes - but this means you get lists, vectors, maps, sets and regexes built in); Clojure has direct access to the JVM and therefore Java objects; Clojure has built in multiple dispatch, concurrency support (with transactional memory) and a bunch more.<p>So, while Scheme is definitely a lot simpler, Clojure has a lot more built right in (I'm fairly sure Scheme provides libraries for a lot of, if not all, of these features though). Actually, since most of Clojures advanced features can be ignored, I think the only thing thats more complex is the way the syntax uses () and [] (though, IMHO it does make the code simpler once you understand it) and the list/vector/maps/sets - since instead of everything being a list, it can now be one of many different data structures (though in practice having them makes life easy).<p>Clojure also benefits from a wealth of libraries, since you can use any Java class directly from Clojure.<p>Disclosure: my experience with Scheme is limited to reading SICP, but I've been using Clojure a LOT over the past 4 or 5 months, so obviously Im biased :-)",1263292007
1047238,story,,,29,24,jgrahamc,"Ask HN: Would people pay for this service?",,"I realized the other day that I have an experience that not many people do: I've worked for five start-ups, founded two, raised money for four.  Of the five, one went public, one was an asset sale/close the door, one was bought out, one is alive and well, and one is new.<p>I also worked for the top VC firm (Accel Partners) and I've raised money from Greylock, USVP, Mayfield, Accel, ... and I've talked to all the others.<p>At Accel I sat through presentation after presentation by entrepreneurs. I've seen the good, the bad and the truly weird.<p>Now imagine the following service.  You are a start-up looking for a series A investment (something >$1m).  Suppose I consulted for you on how you present yourselves to VCs in exchange for a consulting fee in $ and a small equity position (perhaps as a stock option).  The fee would only be payable once series A closed.  No series A, no fee.  No cash up front.<p>Is this useful?  What help would people like?",1263291945

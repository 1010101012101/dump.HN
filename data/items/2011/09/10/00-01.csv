I much prefer non-fiction books - because I feel like I am learning.<p>However, I love the screen adaptations of science-fiction. Game of Thrones is an all-time-favorite of mine, as well as many movies that started as a novel.<p>Seeing this list has kinda tempted to me to partly revise my position, but I would love to hear from fellow HNers that were either like me and have since dove in and loved it, or just loved it from the beginning.<p>I love words, and language.<p>I just fear that if I sit down with a sci-fi book, then I am wasting time. It's not as if I will ever recall any of that information to reference in the future.<p>But I kinda feel like I may be missing out on something huge (e.g. interesting wordplay that authors use, or anything else that I might be overlooking).<p>Help convince me.",1315616342

Music has been for me, as a listener and as a musician who sometimes uses samples, effectively free and without copyright for years now. It's already nearly impossible to make money by selling recorded sound. This just slows down the decay of the music industry, easing the transition to whatever new model will arise. And I don't mean economic model - I'm prepared for the recorded music industry to die completely. What replaces it may be an industry based around live, communal, algorithmic, etc. modes of music creation or music may lose importance to Western culture altogether.

No works are being removed from the public domain.<p>Furthermore, this only applies to sound recordings. Under current EU law, the copyright in a sound recording does not last as long as the copyright in the underlying musical work. Wouldn't that mean that even if the sound recording passed into the public domain, the public would not be able to make use of that recording because the underlying musical work would still be under copyright?<p>The only ones who benefit from the sound recording going out of copyright before the underlying musical copyright, it seems to me, are the record labels--they get to go from paying royalties on both the performance and the composition to just paying royalties on the composition.",1315615425
2980379,comment,2980119,2980119,1,0,languagehacker,,,"Nice proof of concept. It'd be more impressive with more sensible markup. The <b/> and <i/> tags are deprecated, and have always been intended to define the display of their innertext -- not much more. This requires the tags with or without any actual text inside them to function. Without them, it's just a box. With text within them, it looks terrible.<p>I've dealt with designers who do this before -- implement HTML and CSS approaches that are not quite ready for the big leagues, to the absolute detriment of sensible markup within a real web application, or even a simple website. It's not just a problem for implementation (since you often have to unnecessarily decorate the data you're displaying), but it's a problem in terms of intelligently applying semantic markup to improve the machine-readability of what's being displayed on your site.<p>It's important to keep in mind that effectively implemented markup is leveraged not only by search engines, but by individuals with disabilities. You should always aim for informative, compliant, and forward-thinking markup before bending basic rules to make something look nice.",1315615417

I went with Chef, since it seemed easier to setup, and I liked the methodology behind it better. That said, there are a few issues around its choice of dependencies (solr, how I hate you).<p>Basically, I liked how chef treated the terminals as ""dumb"" and the configuration could be stored in source control. All of my nodes/""cookbooks""/recipes/users/data bags are stored in version control, with a few simple shell scripts to batch load the data. Also, chef nodes ping back to the server, which could cause problems (if you had tens of thousands of nodes hitting frequently), but also solves issues like ""what if a server is offline when an important update should be pushed""<p>I believe that puppet has far more tools for seeing what's going on with your servers, when they last updated, that kind of thing.

2980357,comment,2979405,2979934,5,0,leot,,,"Well put, as pg's essays usually are. But I think there are rather large gaps:<p>1) He glosses together reduction of income inequality with elimination of it. The zero inequality thing has been tried and failed.<p>2) one of his arguments is that better education of the poor will increase wealth inequality, because it will increase the number of customers and the number of possible entrepreneurs.<p>While the premises are no doubt true, the conclusion isn't. There are other inequality-decreasing factors that might well have a stronger impact. At the very least, a better educated population might have the wherewithal to organize and vote for increased taxes on wealthy people. Less cynically, better educated people need less stuff to get by (e.g. their cars last longer), and they are savvier consumers. And empirically, if one excludes the U.S., the best educated countries tend to also have the lowest income inequality.<p>3) pg neglects the <i>costs</i> of U.S. monetary policy on risk taking. The past 20 years have seen low inflation. When inflation is low, there is less need for money to be invested in order to preserve wealth.  With higher rates of inflation, investors have no choice but to try and extract greater value out of the wealth they have if they want to keep up.<p>4) A related point: pg's argument is that high taxes reduce the large rewards founders get, causing them to take smaller risks. Yet there is nothing intrinsic about taxation that necessitates the burden fall primarily on the recently wealthy. PG's argument doesn't easily apply to ""old money"" -- would the decrease in upside of a wealth tax outweigh the incentives to invest imposed by a wealth tax?<p>From a tech progress/startup perspective, wouldn't the elimination of capital gains in favor of a tax on wealth cause exactly the <i>right</i> kinds of incentives for starting companies?",1315614735

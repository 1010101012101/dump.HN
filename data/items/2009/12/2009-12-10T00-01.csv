I really hope that's not true, but a lot of what I see around me appears to confirm that. Around here, kids run around and well, act like kids -- they get absolutely filthy in record time. My 9 year old walks half a mile home from the school bus stop without anyone panicking that he'll be kidnapped on the way. Subzero temperatures are not an excuse for him to get out of doing outdoor chores. He plays with the outside cats that are not declawed and live on a diet of mice, baby rabbits and the occasional unlucky bird. Who knows what parasites they carry. I've watched him drop his pants and pee in the middle of the road when he though no one was looking. And he perpetually amazes me with his talent for finding wet, sticky mud within seconds of walking outside. OMG!!! We're such awful parentz!!!!<p>Yet he is the very picture of health.

An institution cannot act except via the individuals who comprise it. Diffusion of responsibility is anathema to a moral society; great evil can be performed on behalf of institutions by ""good"" people when it isn't their ""responsibility"".<p>The reality, of course, is that people usually rationalize their way out of being complicit in evil, and in any case are almost never held responsible for their participation, but I don't often hear people promoting that as a <i>good</i> thing!",1260406455

The website gives me a feeling that I'm buying something unique (almost) directly from the artist.  I like that feeling.<p>My first impression of the site is that I see a big blank white space on your home page (next to the green holiday gift certificate).  That feels like a glaring hole, especially above the fold on your front page.  Perhaps you could use that space to emphasize the relatively small text above it: ""Real art, from real artists. No prints, no reproductions.""<p>Speaking of the holiday gift card, the green banner says I can save $100 on a purchase over $500, then the product details page says, ""Holiday Special: Get $50 off a $500 order.""<p>The ""Zoom & Explore"" feature isn't useful.  The magnifier shows me a pixelated version of the regular image.  I think I would prefer to just see a higher-resolution image with your watermark.

My point was that birth rates in America were very low during WWII due to men being off at war and incomes were astonishingly high, while at the same time there was little to spend it on, resulting in high savings rates.  So this phenomenon of a growing economy and low birth rate has occurred before, right here in the USA.  And the results of that -- the post-war boom time -- are generally looked upon as an idyllic time in America's past.

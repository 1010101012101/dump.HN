520239,comment,519928,520080,0,0,jwilliams,,,"All the research I've seen seems to draw the conclusion that the only strong predictor of performance in a job -- is past performance.<p>Puzzles and psychometric testing are useful, but have a lot of limitations. However, you may have a job that involves a high level of responsibility (e.g. people's lives) and you want to assess their response to stress/crisis. Again, it's not perfect -- you don't truely know how someone will respond in a unique situation -- but in those circumstances you might want all the information possible.<p>References, by and large, are useless.<p>Cultural fit is incredibly important, but there are very few interviewers or interview techniques that do this adequately. There is so much bias in this it's hard to assess very well.<p>So what are the keys for me? Validating what they have on their CV. If they have experience with a particularly technology, I ask about it. I propose problems that they are likely to encounter every day in their job, and see how they go about fixing it. From what I've seen, abstract problems do not exercise this sufficiently.<p>What is it from there? Well, if what they have been doing is a fit for the job, then that's great. If there is a gap, there is an assessment on what it will take to bridge. How a person has conducted their career is a good indicator on how achievable this is.",1237312776

520215,comment,519928,520146,0,0,raganwald,,,"I love discussing the manhole question because the alleged answer is not the point. The point of such a question is for the candidate to think aloud and walk you through their problem exploration process. Such questions select for people who are a little meta about themselves, which is why they can think about something and talk about their thinking at the same time.<p>The infamous retort is this parody: <a href=""http://hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/000962.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/000962.php</a><p>But that really illustrates the trap of almost all interview questions. The interviewer is obsessed with the correct answer, when in reality it's the process of arriving at any answer that matters.<p>My personal beef with ""Aha!"" questions is that if given one that I actually solve on the spot, I can't tell you much about how I got it. It just came to me.<p>The only exception I can remember is a question about finding whether a linked list has a cycle in it. The ""proper"" answer involves a pair of cursors, one of which operates at double the speed of the other. I came up with a much less efficient but equivalent solution because the problem reminded me of something we did with Turing machines in college back in the 80s.<p>So in that particular case I could actually explain how I arrived at an answer. Now that I think about it, I think I'm a pattern-matching machine. My algorithm for solving problems is to perturb them until they resemble something I've seen before.",1237312123

Sure, a lot of these businesses will fail, but at least the whole point of a business is to create value, and there will be a lot of winners, too.

To give a very simple example, I personally do not like writing code in an interview. I strongly dislike trying to ""Guess the coding style the interviewer is thinking of.""

The problem most people keep bringing up with these things is that you will miss some good people that they have worked with who couldn't have done these problems.

The total number of all Esperanto speakers in the whole wide world (at any given level of proficiency you care to define) is less than the number of new speakers added by English or Chinese in a single year. There will always be much better return on investment of time, money, and effort to learning any of the top dozen or so natural languages than to learning Esperanto. And that's why Esperanto is the language for which tomorrow never comes as to it being widely used as an auxiliary international language.<p>Studying Esperanto is a fine hobby, and one I have engaged in, but it is a poor solution to the practical problem of communicating with more people who don't know your native language.

2057833,comment,2057704,2057704,0,0,lkrubner,,,"In New York City there are a lot of jobs. I went to 3 job interviews and got offers from 2. All 3 had tests of my programming skill, though the 3rd was ruthless about minor syntax errors. For instance, the guy talking to me asked me how to find all of the Apache servers running on a server. He just wanted the number. I typed:<p>ps aux | grep apache | wc -l<p>but this wrongly included the command I was typing. We were working on their dev server and I was typing the commands into the terminal. I got back 12 when the real answer was 11. He eventually showed me what I should have typed:<p>ps aux | grep apache | grep -v grep | wc -l<p>The grep -v screens out the line I had just typed which had ""grep apache"" in it. Of course, there are other ways to do this, but this was the first thing I thought of. Of my error, I thought that was somewhat minor, but this guy had recently been hired to clean up a sloppy programming department, so he was looking for programmers who were flawless.<p>The other 2 tests at the other 2 jobs covered the usual questions (write a JOIN statement, write a sub-query, what is the difference between GET and POST?). On one of the interviews, 2 programmers came in to talk to me and they gave me a short PHP script which was working but which was badly written. They asked me how I would re-write it. Easy enough.<p>My sense is there is a lot of hiring going on in New York City. Possibly not enough local talent to fill all the jobs, but the businesses are here for other reasons (other than programming talent) so I think eventually programming talent from elsewhere will get drawn to New York City. There are some cities in the USA that are in deep economic decline, and will probably remain so for the next 5 years, so perhaps some of the programmers from those cities will migrate to New York City.",1293901121

The applications will interoperate both with each other and with the OS (background services/tasks, quicklook, spotlight, etc, etc, etc). The interaction model will already be familiar to the user, visual cues will be understood, the speed and inertia of animations (such as scrolling) will be expected.

Every time you see a crash which is caused by jumping to some unknown address, there's a pretty good chance that the crash is exploitable - but you can't tell that easily without going through the source / poking around the binary.<p>Basically in many cases the jumps into non-code areas mean that some buffer overflowed (or some pointer got corrupted) and overwrote the stack frame return address. As long as you can control what was overwritten, you're likely to be able to point at the data you supplied yourself (back at the stack with some text you control). If that condition is true, you can provide new code for execution straight from html - that means the crash is exploitable.<p>Then again, even if you can't see how is that specific crash exploitable, it doesn't mean it isn't. For some time double-free crashes were just bugs. Then someone found out you can manipulate the pointers in possible later reallocations. What I'm trying to say is that every crash caused by user supplied data should be looked at from the ""might be exploitable in the future"" perspective.",1293898828

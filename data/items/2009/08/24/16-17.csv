Maybe we've lost the ability to build cheap nuclear plants like we could in the 1960s. Maybe modern regulatory and labor problems are unsolvable. But I don't think so.

But every time I've witnessed a company pre-announce an aggressive hiring binge like this, what happened was a hiring surge followed by an equally precipitous exodus less than 18 months after the announcement. It's funny that the article mentions cash flow because the exoduses I have seen have been precisely because cash flow got out of hand with the implementation of the strategy. It's not just salaries that increase. People need places to work so new office space needs to be acquired; the IT infrastructure needs to be updated to accommodate the new hires; people get promoted into positions overseeing the new hires where they prove to be incompetent and this results in wasted labour and duplicated effort; etc. One of the reasons I think such a hiring binge is terrible is because it usually causes forward momentum of the company to slow drastically if not stop entirely. The 12 month transition period where the company is trying to come to terms with everything is a prime opportunity for competitors to pounce and steal away revenue, resulting in cash flow to slow.",1251131139

Since I'm a contestant (alertme.tv), I've been able to browse all the 157 teams who were able to get deployed. Here's an sneak peek at 11 amazing entries that I think could easily be successful as startups if they are given a chance after the competition ends. All of these apps were built by a team in 48 hours.<p>#1 LowDown - http://mcp.r09.railsrumble.com\nIf you are into cucumber (cukes.info), you'll love this app. It enables you to build specs, and share them them with your clients before implementation. Amazing interface, and huge SaaS potential. I would for this pay right now.<p>#2 Hi, I'm - http://hi.im\nCool way to build a landing page for yourself. This is what google profiles should be. Landing page urls look like http://hi.im/jacques<p>#3 Omnominator - http://omnominator.com\nCute & useful site to choose restaurants among groups. This would be huge as a google wave widget, or integrated into an existing communications platform. The site is incredibly useful on its own though.<p>#4 Thingivore - http://thingivore.com\nIf you've used delicious library on the mac, this is basically the web version of that. Insanely nice ui and interactivity. This app could make a fortune off amazon's affiliate program.<p>#5 Neighborhood Watch - http://neighborhoodwat.ch \nA new peer 2 peer way to monitor web site uptime. You install it on your server and everyone checks everyones websites. Tons of additional data and alerts you could with all the additional servers checking up on you.<p>#6 Techmeets - http://techmeets.com\nNice looking alternative to meetup.com - focused on technical meetups. Crowded market, but this is a decent niche and easy its especially easy to monetize developer eyeballs (job boards, dev tools, etc).<p>#7 Straightlist - http://husohuso.r09.railsrumble.com\nAllows you to post and browse installation / deployment steps. Every linux blog on the planet could integrate with this site. Some sort of simple website integration widget is needed.<p>#8 SmackSale - http://smacksale.com\nReddit like tool for tech bargains. Lots of sites already like this, but this one is nicely built and could easily compete among the others. Obvious affiliate potential if they can get traffic.<p>#9 Nybbl - http://nybblme.r09.railsrumble.com\nA way to publish small bits of knowledge, with micropayments. Any good hacker comes up with tidbits of useful knowledge every week that he runs across. This could be a neat way to try to monetize that knowledge by getting paid subscribers to these tidbits.<p>#10 Last Percent - http://lastpercent.com\nNice and simple tool to check a website. Looks for broken image links, html validation errors, and css errors. Every developer should use something like this.<p>#11 Table Surfing - http://tablesurfing.com\nCool way to meet new people by setting up dinners with strangers. Would be tough to get enough people on the site to make it useful for finding random dinners, but the site's well designed and looks like it would work well just using it amongst friends<p>Some awesomely ridiculous apps that deserve mention:\n- lazeroids.com (online massively multiplayer asteroids). Seriously.<p>- stomachly.com (restaurant ratings based on bowels)<p>- celebritypassage.com (tribute site to dead celebs)",1251129932

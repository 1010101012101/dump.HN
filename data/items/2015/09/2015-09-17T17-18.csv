It doesn&#x27;t matter if you spend $600k on one thirty second television slot, a full page ad in the newspaper, or 10 million Facebook ads.<p>I disagree with you based on personal experience.<p>I know several companies with an online marketing cost per order of say (number fuzzed just in case someone links me, but order of magnitude), <$5 and average order size of $100 and gross margin of 40%, and average time between entry and purchase of an hour or two.<p>I&#x27;ve heard several instances at these companies of someone saying &quot;let&#x27;s make our end of month numbers look better&quot; and subsequently blowing extra cash (sometimes millions) on online advertising with immediate results, and little change in company CPO. The budget is literally a function of what capital is at hand to be allocated to marketing. E.g. you don&#x27;t want to grow too fast or you get operational issues, so you cut marketing spend a bit and sales slow down a bit so the warehouse can catch up.<p>At a (very high) CPC of $1 those $600,000 are up to 600,000 visitors... that&#x27;s a lot of data to think about. Spending it in chunks, optimizing for ROI instead of fluffy &quot;KPIs&quot;, and doing a bit of stats, is usually enough. As the original article effectively says.<p>What is true is that how &quot;X&quot; is doing (where X can be any marketing platform, channel, magic solution sold by slick suited, Rolex wearing sales guys) is impossible to generalize. I was fortunate enough to see the same methodology used in around 40 countries around the world and yield vastly different results: sometimes Facebook display ads are your best channel, sometimes they cost you 100x what you make back; sometimes Google is amazing, other times display retargeting is it. You should always try everything and make decisions once you have enough data.<p>And sometimes it even changes after a few years: e.g. a country which goes from blackberries to large screen touch phones with massive CPUs is going to see an improvement in display ads. So you keep dipping just in case. It&#x27;s a high dimensional problem, further complicated by the quality of your own team (and evolution of the product) - as Ogilvy wrote at length, the intrinsic quality of the ad goes a very long way towards its success.",1442511462

10234710,comment,10231905,10233320,0,0,EGreg,,,"The question of utilitarianism rests on the opprotunity cost of doing one thing versus another. Sure, some costs are relatively easy to estimate - vegging out on your couch for days watching TV will not likely lead to a lot of good for others (except possibly if you are actively doing research). But since even great investment firms don&#x27;t always know which entrepreneurs to back, how are you supposed to know whether your current entrepreneurial efforts won&#x27;t pay off more by reinvesting what you earned into building your business?<p>Perhaps at the other end, the focus on individual contribution is arbitrary as well. This is also a focus of libertarians who are methodological individualists - who say only individuals act, not orgabizations, and eg paying taxes to have a government agency pay for schooling is always less efficient than a charity that funds private school admission for poor students. But who says? That&#x27;s quite an extreme position.<p>Who says YOU can do the most good? Perhaps if they hired someone else to make the money they&#x27;d make more and donate more correctly. Maybe you&#x27;re better off getting out of the way.<p>Who knows maybe your company when led by someone else can do even more good? Maybe you should step aside after you&#x27;ve built it?<p>Perhaps giving your time and money to educate a kid or invest in someone else&#x27;s work will go further because they&#x27;ll earn more money?<p>Perhaps robots can do a better job than you.<p>With more and more technology and automation, it really does seem like there are diminishing returns from a growing class of people, and demand for their labor is falling. Perhaps the best thing people around the world can do is use condoms and prevent overpopulation in their respective areas.<p>From a purely utilitarian calculus, is it better to have as many kids as you can if you can maximie the QUAYs? What if you could have less kids but they&#x27;d all have a higher quality of life? Isn&#x27;t that better than having a society crammed with poor kids, who as the article points out are nearly as happy as the rich? Is it really additive? Or are we risking an ecosystem crash that can suddenly lead to greater misery?<p>In short, we don&#x27;t really have all the answers. I&#x27;d advise erring on the side of admitting we don&#x27;t know what we could so to an ecosystem and not try to rape externalities to satisfy unchecked population growth and growing demand. Ecosystem collapse may be the thing that crashes your QUAYs down, and even if after the whole mess your sum was still higher due to sheer population numbers, I question the additivity.<p>Finally the problems come down to this: what is the definition of SHOULD?<p>I believe there is a hidden premise that many people omit when they say should. It is a ternary relation:<p>A should do B <i>if A wants C to happen</i><p>Without individual goals, there is no should.
As for the responsibility of the individual, here is my simple answer and the motto of our company:<p><i>People live lives. Companies create products.</i><p>Yes it is a bit ordinary and not as catchy sounding as &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;. But it at every point make it clear who has responsibility to do what. When you are working for a project, you create a repeatable product and drive down costs through maximizing re-use. When you are off the clock, you live your life and honor your relationship, which are deeper than just &quot;I don&#x27;t know you from a hole in the wall.&quot; In the marketplace, there are less promises and moral obligations than in an intimate relationship, where shared goals are formed.<p>Remember - poverty is already going down around the world. The biggest issue we can face today is an ecological disaster caused either by us or an outside factor. Given the history of life on Earth, we can say that the probability of an outside event exceeding what we&#x27;ve seen in the last 10,000 is slim. However, our own population growth in the last 200 years is staggering and unprecedented! We should worry about collapse of various ecosystems that we put pressure on.<p>At the very least, these utilitarians should read about the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument</a> and stop focusing on mere additivity of QUAYs.

I sometimes need a little time to assess the project&#x27;s scope or technical detail, but personality wise, I know almost instantly if the client is going to be a problem.<p>Clues:<p>Does the client respect your time? Texting me at 11:00 PM to talk about your project isn&#x27;t going to work. Bad. Do not let the client intrude like this. It will drive you mad.<p>Does the client want to defer payment because they&#x27;re talking to a big customer who needs to sign on? That&#x27;s utterly unrealistic. Bad. Clients who are about to sign big customers are well past the dev hiring stage. This speaks to poor business management skills.<p>Does the client have leave a wake of unreliable developers in his path? If so, tread carefully. One is ok- there are a lot of flakey devs out there. Two is not. I once had a guy ask me if I could asses his previous dev&#x27;s work as support for a small claims case. Um. no.<p>Does the client want to offer equity instead of cash? This is almost always bad. People who know what they&#x27;re doing generally have some cash to get started, and generally prefer to use it. You <i>might</i> find a good client doing this, but it&#x27;s very rare in my experience.<p>Does the client want to talk about entrepreneurship or does he have something to build? I get a lot of talkers. See the part above about respecting my time.<p>Has the client actually thought about what it is he wants?<p>Does the client have wildly misplaced sense of the technical scope of his project? Just say no.<p>Does the client come off as lacking in confidence? This isn&#x27;t horrible, but they tend to be short lived, one off projects.<p>Can the client communicate clearly? This can be a real problem if they can&#x27;t.<p>Does the client want you for crunch time because he planned poorly? <- Reread the last 4 words of this sentence.<p>Does the client want you to work with some cheap overseas code because they blew half their budget on what they thought would be a good deal and don&#x27;t realize they have to start over now?<p>The theme is people in over their heads.

I just came from a startup on .NET. The develop/build/test/deploy cycles were really slow (mostly due to tooling/infra, not the language), which meant devs didn&#x27;t ship frequently and didn&#x27;t test their code much. That affected the culture quite a bit: no rapid experimentation means no hacker mentality.<p>It may be that you can develop rapidly with C# or Java (I just wouldn&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t ever used either in a highly-productive environment) but if they hold you back from shipping quickly, they hold you back from the hacker/startup mentality.",1436324202

The first system Wirth and Jurg Gutknecht designed was Lilith [1]. They improved Pascal to make modular software in the form of Modula-2. They made a P-code-like assembler language called M-code to make compilation easier and raise assembler abstraction slightly. They then wrote most of the system in Modula-2. They had in about 2 years a computer, OS, compiler, and some apps. ETH used these day-to-day and they later morphed into Oberon system.<p>The brilliance of Wirth was keeping things simple. I think he overdid it but it served him well in many ways. He also kept things consistent where possible. Just having a simple language, compiler, libraries, and consistent + simple bytecode target would be better than what I&#x27;ve dealt with coding. Each iteration, he tries to improve the language and platform with lessons he learned from the first. He also ensures the lowest common denominator is easy to port, compile efficiently, and produce efficient code for.<p>A lot of inspiration. He&#x27;s recently put Oberon on a custom, simple processor running on an FPGA. The latest incarnation of the system is A2 Bluebottle [2] with downloads here [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2/Lilith.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2/Lilith.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sage.com.ua/en.shtml?e1l0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sage.com.ua/en.shtml?e1l0</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/downloads/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/downloads/index</a>",1436322439

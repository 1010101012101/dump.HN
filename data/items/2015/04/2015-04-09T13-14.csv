How can you insist that economics of software development equate to the economics of human labor?<p>Economics drives everything but one of the main points of software development is the economic advantage it brings in terms of skill and cost.<p>All things considered, software is cheaper to be skilled, and economically speaking, will always outperform equivalent modern-cost human labor at these tasks. Dollar for dollar at scale, at least.<p>Software isn&#x27;t perfect but if it wasn&#x27;t economically superior to human labor none of us would have a job right now.",1428587961

Having taken several of these classes, it all seemed kind of silly to me.  They&#x27;re great for curiosity and continuing education, but nowhere near replacing a college degree.<p>Seeing the kind of money that&#x27;s going into these ventures, there are obviously people still betting big.  I think they face a real challenge marketing these classes and certifications as valuable to the students and employers.  Coursera used to award a free statement of accomplishment (a PDF, basically).  The classes that I&#x27;ve taken recently only recognize students who pay for a verified certificate.  The fee is really small, but it&#x27;s not really worth anything to me.<p>I&#x27;ve very much enjoyed having free access to so many different classes.

When I was in high school, I worked in a little computer lab in my small hometown of Ojai, California, that taught classes in Photoshop, Fireworks, web design and development, Flash, and more. That little technology education company was just called &quot;Lynda,&quot; and classes were taught directly by Lynda Weinman, Bruce Heavin, and others. There were maybe ten or twelve employees. I learned a lot from them over two summers about the intersection of development and design, about teaching and working with people, and so much more. It launched my interest in user experience design and development. Not to mention the epic LAN parties we used to have in that computer lab with all the top-of-the-line graphics workstations... good times.<p>I have a lot to be thankful for, and I&#x27;m so genuinely happy to see their success.

The common theme I find in all three is the quality and health of a dependency. I agree with OP that stars and latest commit are not clear indicators of quality.<p>I think more useful indicators are tests, documentations and pull requests.<p>* Tests. These are things you can actually run to see if the library actually works. In most cases, you can read them and understand how it is supposed to be used. On some platforms even if the tests passed in the past, they may not pass now, for example using different version of the language or platform. The coverage of the tests would be nice, but it is hard to measure at first sight, therefore using the ratio of tests LOC to library LOC might be an indicator.<p>* Documentation. The documentation itself does not change how the library behaves but it is a clear indicator whether the author expected someone else to be able to use it or not, and shows a sort of responsibility. Most of weekend hacks would not have one.<p>* Pull Requests. If there are old and open pull requests, that seem useful, it is a bad sign for the maintainer of the project.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hawkins.io/2015/03/on-ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hawkins.io/2015/03/on-ruby/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/04/its-ok-for-your-open-source-library-to-be-a-bit-shitty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/04/its-ok-for-your-open-source...</a>",1428587597

It was very recently (last year or so) that Lynda started doing more business courses[2] (how to calculate ROI, how to write a business plan, etc)  Since those business courses are probably their thinnest and weakest offerings, I can only speculate that it was a partly a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; to show a prospective acquirer (such as LinkedIn) the breadth of topics the content platform could deliver.<p>In that case, LinkedIn is really buying Lynda&#x27;s content delivery platform (<i>the technology</i>) as opposed to seeing value in the existing portfolio of courses (<i>the copyrights</i>).<p>It will be interesting to see how it plays out.  I&#x27;m somewhat saddened that a controversial company like LinkedIn (UI dark patterns, creepy privacy invasions) was the one who bought them.

It has everything to do with managing costs and acceptable risks, and not some inherent insafety of flight. An airplane can be made just about as reliable and reliable against pilot errors as you want. The technology is there, has been for decades, it&#x27;s only matter of costs and performance.<p>The crashed plane was a two-engine model, designed so in case of one engine failure it could still fly safely. However, the <i>margin of safety</i> was small enough that once the wrong engine was throttled back, the plane became uncontrollable before the engine regained enough power. Spinning up engines takes certain, well-known, time.
It&#x27;d be entirely possible to design and build a plane that would handle such accidental throttling gracefully. All you need is one more engine, or larger wings giving more lift at slow speed and thus allowing it to remain in the air long enough to recover.<p>The crux is the airlines choose not to go for either option simply to cut costs, accepting lower safety margin.<p>Now consider fully automatic plane flown by computer -- designing and debugging a robust hardware/software solution is very costly.
Especially when it comes to handling tricky, rarely-occuring cases, like unexpected failures. Throw in both cost of handling of multiple versions of planes -- different engines, different avionics, and handling of flightworthiness reduced by wear and tear. Also attach the risk of mismatched configuration, with no experienced pilot inside to spot the problem.<p>In the end, the amount of money spent on development, and the level of redundancy of software/hardware autopilot would be dicated by cost-cutting and going for what the airline deems acceptable risks.<p>The computer pilot would be just as (un-)safe as human pilot, for the reasons of economics. Safety is calculated and kept per passenger * mile, not dictated by current technology.",1428587190

9347387,comment,9345026,9345773,0,0,ssharp,,,"Dog breeding and cat breeding are two very different things. Sure, you&#x27;ll find cat breed loyalists, but nowhere near the numbers you&#x27;ll find with dog breed enthusiasts. Most people are fine locating a cute domestic long/short hair cat and adopting it. People are much pickier with dogs. Sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for superficial and arbitrary reasons.<p>People tend to have stronger bonds with dogs and different dog breeds behave much differently. If you want a smart, energetic dog, and enjoy doing things like agility, you&#x27;re probably going to go after a herding group dog rather than a bulldog. But that herding dog probably isn&#x27;t going to make a great pet around children, so if you want a family dog, maybe you&#x27;re going to go after a calmer breed like a Golden.<p>And for people who use dogs for jobs (which is a big reason breeding came to be and still exist), the breeds excel at whatever they&#x27;re meant to do. Sport dogs for hunting, herding dogs for working livestock, terriers for chasing out 
vermin, etc.<p>While I largely agree with you that commercial breeding is far too rampant, there is some value in maintaining breeds. One positive side effect is that you can still get rescue mutts that exhibit positive qualities of breeds while also being much healthier than if it were a purebred. For example, I used to have a mixed breed dog that had clear herding blood and she did great in agility, learning tricks, etc. but didn&#x27;t have the genetic issues that many Border Collies, Australian shepherds, etc. have.<p>Unfortunately, you&#x27;re right in that people choose breeds for illogical reasons. For any dog breed, it&#x27;s very easy to find their strengths and weaknesses online and find a breed that&#x27;s actually a good fit. Instead, people pick a breed because they like the way they look or because they had good memories of a dog in that breed. Breed-based rescues always have dogs that are dropped off because the family didn&#x27;t properly research the dog and when the dog exhibited traits that could be fully predicted by doing research (e.g. their Aussie herded and knocked over their toddlers or nipped their ankles).",1428586849

Here, they spend money to make it a good experience because it&#x27;s a revenue driver. They can provide personalized assistance, but the techs can also build a relationship they can use to sell more stuff. Apple also spends a lot of time making their products intuitive (or at least &quot;fail safe&quot;) so many customers don&#x27;t need support in the first place.<p>Phone support? Not so much.

Many of these folks have been burned by fake job leads and/or false promises -- they aren&#x27;t likely to spend their time on you unless you give them a good reason to do so.<p>If you want to recruit those people, you need to offer higher quality compensation, and make it <i>exceptionally</i> clear that the claims in your job ad aren&#x27;t lies or half-truths. Make it clear that you actually want to hire someone, that you want someone good, that your position is worth having, and that a candidate isn&#x27;t wasting their time trying to apply for your position.<p>- - -<p>Salary and benefits are a great place to start. Another option is more interesting, less mainstream technologies.  Another option is increased flexibility, lower demands, or improved career growth (for example, 35hr work weeks, or paid conferences, ability to move up within an organization). There&#x27;s lots of other interesting ways to do this, but make sure you cover the fundamentals well first, before getting creative.<p>- - -<p>If you are offering a high quality position -- don&#x27;t hide it behind vague words, be <i>overwhelmingly</i> specific so that it doesn&#x27;t look like you are lying (because many other companies do).<p>For instance, Many people will mentally translate &quot;competitive salary&quot; into &quot;low-ball salary&quot;, as that&#x27;s what most companies use that phrase for. If your salary is actually competitive, you don&#x27;t need to hide behind those words, you should just say the specific dollar range your offering.<p>Similarly, if you actually offer great benefits, be sure to list them specifically. &quot;Great benefits&quot; will get mentally translated to &quot;standard or shitty benefits&quot;, because that&#x27;s what most companies use that phrase for. &quot;100% employer covered HMO medical, for yourself/spouse/dependents.&quot; or &quot;4% employer match 401k.&quot; is always more attractive than &quot;great benefits&quot;.<p>Do this for everything &quot;We value networking and learning&quot; means little, but writing &quot;the company will pay 100% of the food/lodging/travel/ticket expense for one tech conference per year of your choosing&quot; is valuable.

9347286,comment,9346920,9346920,0,0,_petronius,,," >> If the environment that produced this horrific behavior in Atlanta is “toxic,” blame the people who control that environment, not the testing regime that attempts to hold those people accountable. The teachers unions that run our schools view public education, first and foremost, as a jobs program for adults. That is why the unions fight so hard to keep open failing schools and want seniority—rather than teaching ability—to determine layoffs.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author of this piece manages to back up his argument very well. The teachers&#x27; union says that the testing regime is flawed, and that the toxic environment is created by it; the author says that the testing regime is &quot;flawed&quot; but not &quot;fatally&quot; so, without substantitively adressing that concern. The &quot;people in charge&quot; of this environment are in turn governed by No Child Left Behind and state/federal regulation and laws -- there&#x27;s a chain of authority here, and the brokenness of the system can rightly be argued to flow down from the highest policy levels all the way to local middle-management.<p>>> Would you want your child taught by someone who flunked the certification test five times, let alone 10?<p>This is a silly argument. How many people take multiple tries to get a driving license? The test either ceritifies you or it doesn&#x27;t.<p>>> And would that instructor be more or less likely to resort to changing student test scores to hide his own incompetence?<p>Absolutely no logical connection, other than a wild assertion by an author clearly hostile to the teachers&#x27; union, and it seems to me, teachers in general.<p>Like it or not, public school teachers in the US are vastly underpaid and overworked (especially in urban school districts with low budgets), and have their ability to teach severely hampered by testing requirements that may or may not be beneficial to their students. The whole system is broken, but demonizing the people that are attempting to educate in these conditions without trying to understand the pressures at play isn&#x27;t very constructive.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/transcript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/275/t...</a>",1428585775

If your uncle invested ten grand in your iOS App, then it totally tanked, I expect your uncle would still manage to get by somehow, but you would always regret having asked him to invest.<p>Of more concern to me, in my actual experience, is that it is quite common for VCs to demand control of the company&#x27;s actual operations, and then to rocket it right into the ground, because their concern is the exit revenue, and not for the end-users of the product or service, or for the company&#x27;s employees.<p>Not all VCs are this way, many VCs are quite good.  I have scads of respect for people like Ann Winblad (<a href=""http://www.humwin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humwin.com/</a>).<p>However there are far more startups than their are wise, or even ethical VCs.<p>Thus I have been determined for many years to demonstrate that one can succeed without investment of any sort.

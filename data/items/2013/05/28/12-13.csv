5779657,comment,5779246,5779246,3,0,wittysense,,,"Flat Design is a great discipline which has history in older, more popular disciplines. I believe it's fair to say ""flat"" has much growing to do, but it comes close to breaking with the traditional metaphor of print design. Obviously newspapers and magazines do not have leatherwork or fabric textures either: This is what makes flat design its own, it is a break from the metaphors of Print, not just skeumorphism. Skeumorphism is just one technique like the brush stroke.<p>That said, no one is really talking meaningfully about what makes flat its own discipline. You keep talking about all the points where flat intersects with one albeit ubiquitous technique. Talk about ANIMATION. Why does animation seem like a structural component of layout in flat design? Layering, microcosm, harmony, semantic colors, ""pageless"".<p>You guys just keep talking about one technique which is getting boring because it devalues these incredible designs which need true analysis.",1369745873

5779574,comment,5775324,5777112,5,0,vanderZwan,,,"> <i>As such it is inaccurate, smug, racist and ignorant, and reflects an implicit assumption that the world should be organized so that it is benign to the interests of affluent westerners.</i><p>I understand why you read it that way, but you couldn't be more wrong about what I think about Africa. As rattray mentioned: I wasn't judging them, just making an observation of how things are there.<p>Your interpretation of my standpoint is kind of ironic: I was born in Ghana, lived there the first four years of my life. I feel more of a connection to Africa than to my supposed roots in China (I'm half Chinese too), and I <i>hated</i> growing up in the Dutch countryside. While I was visiting my birthcountry for the first time in 25 years, it was the visiting Westerners that pissed me off. They were always complaining about being treated disrespectfully, and refused to see how their insistence of interpreting situations through a Western lens plays a huge role in all the misunderstandings.<p>So this is getting very off-topic, but let's talk for a minute about white folks not ""getting"" Ghana, as I understand and experienced it. There's plenty of things, but I'll focus on the wealth sharing issue.<p>First of all, if you are wealthier, in the local traditional culture it is perfectly acceptable to be asked or expected to share the wealth. Not in the form of money (more on that later), but material wealth, or ""spontaneously"" paying for something they need. Of course, there's a difference between actually <i>being</i> rich and being perceived as such - and by the way, the locals suffer from this more than we do: ""hey cousin, you moved to the city so you're rich now and can support your family in the countryside, right?"" Well no, but try telling your family that. It's hard to get a break in Ghana, because as soon as you do everyone wants a piece of the pie (and don't get me started on Ghanaian funerals, if there's one example of a tradition being warped and now bankrupting families...[1]).<p>You have to realize that if you're from the West, you are considered rich by definition, so you have to mentally be ready for <i>constantly</i> being asked for support. It's tiring, but it's not like you can blame them. From our point of view it might feel like reverse-racism, but look at it from their perspective: you can afford a plane ticket (<i>return</i> ticket even) and taking a few weeks/months off of earning money and going on holiday - how rich do you have to be for that? Just because Weber-Fechner[2] fools you into not feeling rich back home doesn't mean you're not.<p>Where things go sour is that <i>if</i> you say no, which is perfectly fine, you're supposed to do so with an excuse, so that the person asking doesn't lose face: ""I'm sorry, I can't give you my sunglasses, they're the only ones I have."" Business and social life are not separated there. Because most Westerners instead feel like being hustled, or are just tired of the never-ending stream of requests, they just bluntly reject the haggler, resulting in him/her feeling insulted and going ""well, screw you too then."" So the next time they'll just be more rude and blunt like the Westerners, which can result in this weird cycle of everyone slightly pissing off everyone. If you don't know how to haggle respectfully and understand the social component (and it takes a while before you ""get it""), you will be hustled disrespectfully in return. Luckily there's some locals who ""get"" Westerners and are capable of bridging this.<p>Also, there's a clear correlation between how bad this Western/local culture clash has corroded things and how close to the capitol you are: the closer, the more bluntly the people will ask you for money.<p>Another communication breakdown example: if you stay over at a family, traditionally they would insist you <i>don't</i> have to pay them. Not because they actually mean that, but because you don't discuss money exchanges out in the open - everyone will want a piece of the pie and they might end up with <i>less</i> than what they started with. The exchange happens discretely when nobody is watching, and you have to 'spontaneously' offer it, sometimes insisting on it a few times (although these days nobody is that naive towards Westerners anymore). Also, a Ghanaian will not tell you to your face that he thinks badly of you - you kind of have to infer that indirectly from others.<p>So more than once this has resulted in a Western family leaving without paying, thinking ""wow, those Ghanians are so generous!"", while the Ghanaian family thinks ""those disrespectful jerks exploited us!"" resulting in them being blunt and openly ""Western"" (as they interpret it) towards the next family. And then that family will be openly pissed off and haggle about payment (remember: in Ghana, you <i>never</i> dismiss someone to his face, and are supposed do the haggling indirectly/implicitly by giving excuses so the receiving party's social status isn't compromised - things are never ""just business"" there). So in the end, the local family is even more insulted and the tourists are pissed off and stay away.<p>More than a few local tourism initiatives have failed because of this. These days, the successful tourist villages have a tourist center, where you pay for the whole experience of staying in that village at once, and everyone in the village gets a share later (again, secretively).<p>What pisses me off is that every other visitor I met (implicitly) complained about how the Ghanaians weren't more like us, and more than once I've started an angry rant towards them that fell on deaf ears. No, that's now how it works: we're the visitors, so it's our responsibility to understand the Ghanaian point of view. And they actually have a point in their judgement of us being rich. Not that we should accept being treated as walking fountains of cash, but the <i>""it's unfair, it's not like I have endless supplies of money just because I'm white!""</i> gut reaction is very short-sighted, as it's also unfair that we were lucky enough to be born in an economically privileged position. Think of it as an investment in the local economy, an actually working trickle down effect. Yes, it can be tiresome, but you should have done your homework and realize what you were getting into when you went there. As long as it's no too blatantly disrespectful, and you know how to talk your way out of ridiculous requests with a bit of humor, it's all fine.<p>BTW, this is generalized of course: Ghana is full of different ethnicities and cultures, and things differ from place to place. I had a wonderful time being ""back home"", and in my experience most of the annoyances could be attributed to past miscommunications souring things as explained above.<p>So anyway, back to my original post: it's <i>the local population</i> that is hesitant to pick up internet, because they associate it with Nigerian scams and their reputation being smudged. I'm repeating what I was told by <i>them</i>, and was just being curious how this easy access to internet will change things and how the local cultures will adopt it. Also, if you <i>really</i> want to know more about this issue: <i>""Invisible Users, Youth in the internet Cafs of Urban Ghana""</i> by Jenna Burrel[3].

That's quite generous of you.<p>Thing is though, I find that when we do try to do North American style customer service, we tend not to like it and find it fake and tacky, and judge actual US customer service in the same way. We simply don't trust it and think we are being BSed. When some one serving us in some way says ""have a nice day, Sir"" or some such, the British mind seems to internally mumble ""Yeah, like you give a toss, don't think I'm falling for that one old chap"", or worse!!!<p>But equally, we get really agitated when something happens like the previous poster experienced. We too would want the alternate information to help us on our way.<p>So, we tend to get neither the information we need, nor the NA style ""Sir"" and ""have a nice day stuff"". What we too often get is the nice words, but not the information or action required. Its like the nice words are seen as a cheap replacement for action.<p>Of course this is all rooted in the centuries old class resentment thing. In short many here still see service as subservient. Both ways. Those serving resent serving, those being served look down on those doing the serving. Isolated, its ridiculous, but in historical context, you can understand why.<p>Oh, also there is nothing in it for us. In the US, a lot of service work is usually tipped, coupled with a low initial wage, right? Not so, generally, in the UK. Good service gains the employee little. Might be great for the business, but again, there is this them and us thing between the business owner and the employee. So, the employee just looks at it as gaining them nothing while making the owner more prosperous.<p>No idea if things are improving, as I live here. That is a question that a frequent foreign visitor would be better placed to assess for us.<p>On one hand I think its all very amusingly ""British"", but I do think the whole class resentment attitude really holds us back. But, I have to be honest and admit that even though I think I can see through it, and I can see the really problems with it, I still ""feel"" in those limited class resentment terms.

Oh who knows some kids are just like that.  Thats just how some kids are, why don't you wait and see if he catches up.  I'm sure that's not the case.  Well some kids just develop at a different rate mentally and physically than others.  They'd rather MRI my son for suspected stomach cancer than test for allergy antibodies (or was it just xray?  It was awhile ago).  Seriously.  They had us all in suspected cancer mode before they broke down and tried allergy testing.<p>Eventually, after much arguing, the pediatrician ordered a blood test, referred him to a gastroenterologist, who did some crazy stomach wall tissue biopsy after draining about a quart for innumerable blood tests, and finally, they're like ""yeah, he's severely allergic to gluten per both biopsy and blood tests, so stop eating that"".  And casein and soy.<p>I found it remarkable how hard you have to push to get tests done for a diagnosis like that.  I believe in for profit industry, follow the money.  The worst medical scenario for the patient or the parents is probably cancer or something awful like that.  The worst medical scenario for the doctors and adminstrators is an illness that is treated by a ""simple"" diet change and requires no expensive pills, no expensive followups, no expensive surgery, diagnosis wasn't too expensive other than the tissue biopsy work... that's why you have to fight fight fight to even get tested because that diagnosis is a nightmare scenario for the docs.<p>The point of all this is his development rate skyrocketed once we got him proper food, and he's pretty near caught up to his peers, which is cool.  So you'll have to fight extremely hard to test for food allergies, but it might (or might not) pay off. (edited to add there may be other financial nightmare scenarios for doctors which are hard to get tested.  Hmm, how about vision testing?

Even if you don't agree with it-- even if you'd rather people see how you really are so you don't end up in inappropriate roles-- you're expected to make nice and play along.<p>Job applicants have to overstate their willingness to subordinate. Very rare is a talented person who wants to be a subordinate. Protege to an obvious superior (by which I mean person of superior <i>skill</i>)? Sure, but that's different because there's an obvious symbiosis. Subordinate order-follower? No, no one wants that.<p>On the flip side, hiring managers often overstate the autonomy and future prospects associated with the role.<p>Companies overstate their need for ""passion"". Passionate people never see themselves as subordinates. Proteges, possibly. Not subordinates. Never happens, never will.<p>If you want people who are good at subordinating, you need to go to the other end of the passion spectrum and find people who are happy just to have a job. But no one wants to hire those because, even though they're often good at well-defined tasks, they're taken to be kind of a bummer.<p>I feel like when people go too far to the good-not-nice extreme, you end up with dialogues like this (obviously, more subtly)...<p>Hiring manager: all of the ""vision"" questions and tough technical brainteasers are a false lead. In reality, we're looking to add excess capacity to which we can delegate undesirable work. Also, the reason why we're overhiring is because it makes managers happy to have overqualified subordinates so they can say things like, ""I have four Ivy Leaguers working for me"".<p>Candidate: I don't <i>really</i> see myself as a subordinate, and unless management takes a direct interest in my career and I get the best projects available, I'm going to start serving my own career interests in a matter of about 6 months.<p>No one would hire anyone if people were that honest.",1369742916

The process for determining who is sent to extreme isolation is arbitrary – there is virtually no guidance or limitations on who can be sent to extreme isolation, for what reasons, or for how long.”</i><p><a href=""http://www.nyclu.org/files/publications/nyclu_boxedin_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nyclu.org/files/publications/nyclu_boxedin_FINAL....</a><p><i>The practice is theoretically intended to separate violent and dangerous inmates from the rest of the prison population. The New York Civil Liberties Union, however, uncovered that the majority of those in solitary confinement were given the punishment for nonviolent, low-level offenses. Nearly 90 percent of the men placed in solitary confinement between 2007 and 2011 were there for breaking one of the minor prison rules, such as having unauthorized books, disobeying an order or growing their mustaches too long (“an inmate shall not grow a beard or mustache over one inch in length”). Other documented infractions that led to solitary confinement included one man who had gambling chips in his cell and another who received 45 days for tattooing himself. </i><p>Took me about 3 minutes. Given that the ACLU report was indeed about New York (NYCRR) and you were <i>""unable to find any examples of it""</i>, I suspect you're a tainted or biased source.<p>Given the ""down votes"" (a Reddit term, I think?) on my response that contained decent sources, I'll disengage from this.

Their current way of doing things reminds me a lot of how GitHub works with open source, with the major difference that where GitHub builds completely new systems when they're needed/the alternatives aren't up to par, Canonical builds them all over the place, when many times it would be better if they contributed to the existing projects (Wayland, systemd) and expect the same community support that GitHub gets surrounding their open source code (Resque, Chronic, Jekyll, etc).<p>It's kind of disheartening that Canonical keeps trying to ""disrupt"" existing open source projects by muscling their way behind their own projects, developed in secret, with little to no community input. /rant",1369742806

How does enabling referers ""save the world""?<p>A few weeks ago, I ran across a website (can't remember their domain) that refused to show me any content unless I enabled third-party cookies, and even contained a lengthy argument explaining why disabling third-party cookies hurts the web. IIRC the whole argument was 24K bullshit, written by people who feel entitled to keep making money with their outdated business models and who were obviously alarmed because modern browsers were doing sensible things. And now we're seeing a very similar argument, only this time it's about referers. Why do you think it matters whether I came to your site via Google, Reddit, HN or someone else's blog? What makes you think gives you the right to know that?<p>Webmasters never had the right to know where your visitors were coming from, any more than the owner of a random gas station on the Interstate has the right to know which city his customers are driving from. If SSL is making Referer headers disappear, good riddance. We just closed a privacy hole, 99 more to go. Next in the TODO list: get rid of referers even when the referring website doesn't use SSL, because as the article correctly points out, we've got a bit of inconsistency there.",1369742779

I really like the idea behind systemd/upstart (they're quite similar in practice) and was glad to migrate to systemd when Arch sorted out most of its integration issues.<p>But to be honest, I prefer upstart much more. It's simple, it does one thing, it's clear about what happens (most of the time). With systemd I find myself quite often with no idea where to even look for information about something not starting. I still have a service in the system that I don't know how to remove (it's failing to start apparently, not even sure where does it get created). I spent hours debugging issues and trying to get it all-green on my system... and failed. In my opinion it's just too big and complex for it's own good.

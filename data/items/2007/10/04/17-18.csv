63115,comment,63042,63094,0,0,axiom,,,"I'm not claiming that autonomous driving won't happen or won't be a massive industry in the near future (30-40 years.) My feeling is just that it won't happen there first. Here's a couple of reasons:<p>1. It's a very complicated problem compared to others that could have a similarly large impact.<p>2. The cost of a mistake made by the robot is quite likely to kill someone. This isn't just a problem as far as lawsuits go, but it's a problem because as soon as the first accident occurs you're going to get a barrage of regulations (and quite possibly bans) on autonomous driving.<p>3. As soon as you can build a robot that can clean your floors, walk your dog, and bring you a beer when you want it, you're going to sell a million units in a year. Just look at the success of a fairly simple device like the Roomba.<p>So my thinking is that autonomous dirving will be one of the later things happen as compared to other adoptions of robotics.<p>Edit: this just reminded me of something. Not too long ago the University of Toronto solar car team was driving their solar car down the 401 highway. The driver lost control and ended up getting killed. Within a month all solar cars were banned from driving on public roads in Ontario.",1191520621

I naively thought that it was going to be done immediately because it had been possible and it looks like no one is doing it.",1191520524

63111,comment,63009,63009,0,0,tx,,,"Many influential and smart guys like Paul are saying that starting your own company today got a lot cheaper, but what does it mean in practice? <p>While it depends on a nature of the business you are starting, in many cases ""build something quick"" advice does not work as well as advertised IMO: for most non-trivial ideas ""something quick"" still means a few months of full time commitment which means tens of thousands of dollars that many ""younger nerdish"" founders <i>still</i> do not have.<p>I guess what I am saying is that a million dollars is no different from fifty thousand when that's the money you need but do not have. Sure it probably easier to find an external investor with 50 grand, but is it really? Especially for ""nerdier"" types? <p>This is why YComb exists, but that is only about 30 deals a year.",1191520407

Better Judgement Needed<p>If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people whose job is to judge startups are going to have to get better at it. I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers. We now get on the order of 1000 applications a year. What are we going to do if we get 10,000?<p>That's actually an alarming idea. But we'll figure out some kind of answer. We'll have to. It will probably involve writing some software, but fortunately we can do that.",1191519999
63106,comment,63042,63097,0,0,rms,,,"OK, you're right, Navlab was doing too much at once for that technology to ever be deployed, but it was still important work for the incremental improvements we are seeing, like the auto-parallel parking functions... with everything computerized in a car anyways, it really shouldn't cost too much to implement things like this even on entry level cars.",1191519835

63100,comment,63009,63009,0,0,davidw,,,"> Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.<p>Hrm... one of the things that makes markets work so well is that it brings ""the wisdom of crowds"" to bear, and doesn't require small, homogeneous groups to attempt to pick winners.  So something about that section raises a flag in my head - if there are more startups in the future, maybe more of them will have to go it alone, instead of this ""easy out"" of being bought?",1191519307

63097,comment,63042,63069,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I'm pretty familiar with automated driving, and see a clear path for incrementatl deployment over a few years.<p>It wouldn't start with full automation. It starts with gps/ins/lidar positioning, camera & lidar based car and obstacle detection, camera based lane finding, etc. and built up from there.<p>As I mention in another comment, the regulatory burden is exaggerated considering the human driver still in the vehicle for the early stages of incremental deployment.",1191519016

Between his own liability insurance, the insurance companies not paying up, and the privacy/medical records red tape.<p>This guy's model is actually my Dad's dream: be able to go treat a patient for 30mins, get paid for it(versus fight for hours with the insurance). The actual bill would be lower too because for most part he only has to charge pennies on the dollar since there won't be as much red tape.",1191518862

I for one, don't know any of the rest of you in person, so all I can offer are my experiences.<p>If enough people offer personal experiences, the reader should be able to extract his own pattern from them (that is, after all, what we humans are good at). Just because we are offering raw data (in the form of personal experience) instead of analyzed data (in the form of qualified statements), doesn't make the data any less true (but probably a bit less insightful).<p>I agree that one person's experience doesn't disprove another persons research about the overall pattern, but nor is the experience completely useless.",1191517551

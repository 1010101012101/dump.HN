I understood the parent's point as this; using Sinatra to give yourself the convenience of the {get,post,...} methods for working with HTTP vs. Rails, which forces upon you its more opinionated structure for websites.<p>I agree with the parent, that I have no use for the complexity of Rails and Sinatra is convenient. Other people are free to choose as they wish, and Rails might be the more appropriate library is some cases regardless of preference (like in the sibling post about teams).<p>But there's a ton of utility on the spectrum from Rack to Rails and it's perfectly reasonable to choose a midpoint, and perfectly reasonable to choose it because you think Rails is too much but Rack is not enough.",1347591560

Many applications require your passwords in order to run, and the Keychain is the way OSX apps get those passwords.<p>After a little thought, there are two solutions. First, and best, is to log out, and let your guest use a guest account. Or second, watch over the persons shoulder (which is probably a good idea anyway for the security conscious.)<p>But, personally my biggest concern is that it highlights how  trivial it is for locally installed software to access my other passwords!

Democrats openly channel benefits towards government and private unions as a way to buy their votes.<p>What ""then"" and ""now"" are you talking about? Democrats have been aligned with unions since at least FDR.<p>> If a being from another planet landed in the US and listened to Obama speak it would conclude that the only important people in this nation are ""teachers, police, firemen and construction workers"". Why? Because that is all he mentions in his speeches. Translated: ""union, union, union, union"".<p>I don't know why you think this is the case. Lets see, let's take an example from a speech directly to the audience most friendly to him; the DNC. And let's list all of the occupations that he mentions in a positive way:<p>1. soldier in Pattons Army\n2. work on a bomber assembly line\n3. people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill\n4. teachers\n5. students\n6. scientists and engineers\n7. small businesswoman\n8. construction worker\n9. workers ... who feared theyd never build another American car\n10. business leaders\n11. manufacturing jobs\n12. jobs today building wind turbines\n13. farmers\n14. scientists (again)\n15. construction workers (again)\n16. teachers (again)\n17. principals\n18. students (again)\n19. Americans who still serve in harms way<p>So, he mentions soldiers several time, scientists several times, businessmen/women several times, teachers several times, construction workers several times, students several times. He mentions farmers once, principals once, engineers once, and a few assorted manufacturing jobs (whether you count that as one item or not depends on how you categorize them). He mostly criticizes Wall Street and bankers. So, yes, he does mention the people you mention, but he mentions a bunch of other people as well.<p>> The last thing this country needs is more union workers earning $300K for life when they retire.<p>You are going to seriously have to stretch to find such unionized workers. Sure, you may be able to find one or two here or there to use for anecdotal evidence, but a few anecdotes do not make good evidence. Median wages for unionized workers are $917 per week (~$48,000 per year), median wages for non-union workers are $717 (~$37,000 per year). Source: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm</a>. And the premium for union membership is much higher for lower-wage jobs than higher wage.

I was educated in three different cultures and graduated high-school in both the US and Argentina.  What can I say, my parents got around.  They are entrepreneurs and had businesses both in the US and Argentina.  My father tells some amazing stories about what it was like to do business there.  One of my favorites was when his clothing factory got a surprise visit from a high-ranking local military general.  He showed-up with two trucks and fully armed soldiers.  Went into the office with my father and walked away with an envelope with cash as well as a huge pile of merchandise. The cost of doing business.  Talk about having to have balls of steel.  Not sure I could do that, and I've been around.<p>> Still, I can't agree with your ""Democrats are shit, so you should vote Republican"" argument<p>I didn't really say that.  I drew a parallel between the way Democrats, effectively, throw money at union workers to buy their votes, the votes of their families and those of retired union workers.  Unions, in the US, are a solid unified voting block that always votes Democrat.  That does not happen across groups of millions of people unless their vote is being bought through benefits and more.<p>Please tell me, what are our options?  Only two people have the ability to win the race:  Obama or Romney.  I supported Obama in 2008.  I can't rightly do that today.  His re-election would mean that union will grow stronger and receive more benefits and support than they should.  That, as a single issue, is a deal-breaker for me.",1347589137

Unfortunately, for me at least, I am unable to find very articulate and brilliant threads, content and not humour, on Reddit - either they do not exist or the admins do a very poor job at SEO. More importantly, nearly always are there people who would mess with the mood of the thread using a lame-ass pun or in most cases dumb wordplay initiating a series of similar worthless replies all over. Of course, you would mention that in some of the more serious forums they would be downvoted to hell but then they are no better than Quora anyway, according to your standards.<p>> ""intellectuals who don't have a stick up their behind""\nAnd please stop calling names.",1347588388

They invest, then they try to help but that's it.<p>Beyond that, weird generalization about VC funded companies to say they're all building things that don't matter. As a percentage they mostly don't matter and they mostly fail, but many of them become things people care passionately about and matter a great deal.",1347588371

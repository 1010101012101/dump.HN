In the OOAD world, we call this moving from the problem domain to the solution domain.<p>Is an RGB value just a tuple? Depends on what the problem is. In the context of just one pixel, yes. In the context of an image processing application, you may need an alpha channel, a grid of pixels, an undo, and so forth. By identifying just one type instead of talking about a problem, RGB, the author has created a circular reference. Why do you need more than a tuple for RGB values if you only have RGB values? Well you don't. But programs are not about tuples, they are about solving problems. Yes, a problem can only require one simple datatype to solve, but in my experience that's only for a very small subset of problems.<p>OOP concentrates just on assembling various pre-existing datatypes into something new in order to solve a problem. It concentrates on the type. FP concentrates on what you are doing with the type. Either way you still need to assemble various datatypes. The construction of a new type doesn't go away. The emphasis is just different. You don't need to worry about a copy constructor or any of that anymore because the goal isn't to create reusable types that can last forever. Multi-core processing and our experience with large systems is killing that concept -- most types don't scale as advertised.<p>So OOP skills aren't going anywhere. It's just instead of creating a complex type, we're using those skills to create the minimally-complex type sufficient for our immediate needs. Big change in focus.",1352886563

The BEAM implementation is built to be used in products, it is very stable and bug-free and the OTP team are very cautious when making changes.

4782702,comment,4780359,4780549,1,0,jelpern,,,"Spam does not mean unsolicited marketing. Door-to-door sales, direct mail, telemarketing, billboards - even the guy who in every tourist trap in the world who begs you to come eat at his restaurant - are all unsolicited marketing, but not spam. Spam refers to bulk-generated, unsolicited marketing over electronic mediums.<p>The distinction is important, because in non-electronic mediums, the conversion threshold for unsolicited marketing is high enough that the market more or less self-regulates. Email, or electronic mediums broadly, became a new territory because the CPM of unsolicited messages effectively went to zero, meaning all but the lowest conversion rates would generate positive ROI.<p>As such, sending strangers unsolicited messages about new services over email, twitter, etc is legit, as long as you are doing so manually and are not deceiving them. I have no idea what the AirBNB folks did, but I suspect that it was manual.<p>For a graphical illustration of the history of the word spam, check out this google ngram search: <a href=""http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=spam%2Cjunk+mail&year_start=1930&year_end=2012&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share="" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=spam%2Cjunk+mai...</a>.

It's easier to spot services that spam, or that leak your email address (I became aware of a leak of email addresses on Box... luckily it was only emails that got leaked, at least according to Box support).<p>3.

4782662,comment,4781563,4781563,17,0,MortenK,,,"To ""just work harder"", in this case 36 hours, is the easy decision to make when something goes wrong. It smells deliciously of heroics, bravado and top performer mentality. Most importantly, the soul drenching, exhausting late hours, gives the illusion that ""we are doing all that is humanly possible to resolve the problem"". How tough are we, right?<p>But as the author points out, heaps of literature clearly show that ""crunching"", like it's affectionately called in the games industry, is contra-productive. One guy working 8 hours, going home for a good sleep, and coming back to work an additional 8 hours will vastly outperform the developer-turned-zombie that's been at it for 24 hours straight.<p>At that point, short term memory is gone, stupid mistakes (blunders even) are rampant. Fixing simple issues takes extraordinary amounts of time, because the ability to focus is all but lost. You effectively have tunnel vision and your reactions and logical skills are reduced to that of a drunk.<p>This is not anecdotal - there are an immense amounts of studies done on the subject. But time and again, the knowledge gets discarded because it's just easier to ""work through the night"" at a frantic pace, rather than take the necessary step back, let people rest and do the work in an orderly and planned manner. By burning the candle in both ends, at least no one can challenge your commitment to solving the problem.<p>While it may sound counter-intuitive to go to bed while the house is on fire, it is, at least if 40 years of research is to be believed, actually the only correct thing to do in a software development crisis. Note this doesn't mean ""stick 100% to 8 hours and always go home at 17.01"", but it does mean if you are still there at 23.00 you are much better off going home, getting sleep and resuming work when well rested.<p>The games industry seem to be especially vulnerable to this problem. It might be due to the general inexperience level caused by games development being a young mans game, or it might be due to a failure to understand that games, while glorified in the industry, is ""just"" software, and therefore also subject to all the established rules of software development.<p>In any case, I agree with the author that Molyneux should know better than to tweet from the rooftops how many hours everybody is working, but I guess he is not thinking entirely straight after 36 hours of work.",1352885495

But since Intel doesn't seem willing to support 4.3 at least until 2-3 generations from now, that means there won't be a whole lot of laptops out there that support OpenGL ES 3.0 out of the gate.<p>And of course supporting the full OpenGL 4.3 also means they are as serious as Nvidia and AMD about graphics drivers. But apparently they aren't at that stage yet.",1352883653

204851,comment,204563,204563,0,0,ajross,,,"The most important trick is just to name a price in the first place.  Especially in software, if you're good at what you do and the position is a good fit, you are almost guaranteed to be able to get what you ask for, as long as it's not ridiculous.  At worst, you'll get a counter-offer.  If someone drops you outright it's because they really don't want you and the salary just forces them into a decision.  (Or, rarely, it's because they truly can't afford you: you don't want that job, becuase it won't be there for long anyway.)<p>Employers actually hate it when people come in with squishy responses like ""Oh, I'm not looking for salary specifically..."" because it just makes more work for them.  It's much easier if they can say ""this person costs this much, do we pay it or not?"".  Coming up with a ""fair"" salary is much harder.",1212180809

CompuServe (or was that AOL?) was one of the first to have keyword-based navigation. A few years ago, I met an entrepreneur in London, UK, who was building a company through which you create a unique number for yourself, and that gets associated with all your contact details - sort of like a phone number but to all your contact details (a bit like a LinkedIn public profile I guess). There are other variations.<p>Personally, I find this way of navigation weird and I don't like it.

I got SBCL and Clisp to work.<p>I'm having trouble explaining why I had such a hard time, but I think that's because I was a noob at the outset, but I'm not such a noob any more.  Sure, now I can install Lisp on a friends computer in a day, tops.  For good hackers, installing lisp is trivial.  Of course, there are lots of things that good hackers can do in a tiny fraction of the time it takes anyone else.  But from a noob's perspective, everything is very different.  There might be a place that works, but there are many that don't, and those dead ends are really going to set you back.<p>Maybe I can't see things through a noob's eyes any more, but for whatever reasons, installing lisp took me two months, working full time.",1212178949
204828,comment,204565,204597,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Arguing between 3 or 4 clicks doesn't change anything. There are a lot of problems with beginners and lisp, but they're far from how to get to the first implementation. As a newbee myself, googling for lisp environments was damn easy and instructive: i knew within 20 minutes that I should use linux, and if i really wanted windows (as I did at first) there was only one choice. When I finally had access to a decent linux it took me maybe another 20 to confirm that sbcl is the one I wanted. All that gave me lots of background information on the side.<p>Now the first brush with asdf on the other hand was a nightmare. I still don't understand why I have to become an expert in pgp (definitely not just a beginner) just to use asdf-install.<p>I think the main problem for beginners is the effort it takes to install a reasonable environment. I tried two versions for a web application server: ucw and weblocks. Weblocks meant installing more then 10 different packages and source code is pretty much standard documentation - but it's ok because it's understandable and officially beta anyways. UCW is the standard - after a year and a half I still couldn't produce an installation running on a port different then 8080 (I use 8080 for tomcat for all my machines).<p>All this effort is way disproportionate to the effects. Installing emacs and slime is may not be a breeze, but once you discover that googling ""emacs configuration"" brings up a bonanza it's worth it. (Also that .emacs in windows is _emacs... that's half a day I'll never have back). But so much effort just to get a server running... if you want to help beginners write a better ucw tutorial, don't just rearrange the links on the frontpage of lisp sites.<p>(btw, I hit ctrl-C before hitting reply, I just knew there was an ""expired link"" comming.

But the scientific intent of these tests, if you could call it that, is simply to give your therapist an idea of when to start when trying to figure out some deeper issue.

  <@developer> Don't do that manually.  Use the Session and ACL plugins.

What happened here is that newbie was half way into his half-baked solution, and couldn't figure out how to get it to work.  The developer knew that they were solving the wrong problem, and pushed them in the right direction.  (It does come down to reputation in cases like this, I admit.  If it's someone we've never heard of, they're probably just trying to write an app and they don't need to understand the internals.  If <i>I</i> asked the same question, someone would probably immediately give me the answer.

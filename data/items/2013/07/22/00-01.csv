Songs will be sung in the opsen bars about about this battle.<p>From the sound of the email it suggests they have records of some data (perhaps not sensitive data :-) being compromised but no root cause on how it was compromised, so they are re-building systems from the ground up validating, configuring, and then moving to the next step.There are times where this is faster than spending time trying to root cause the exploit.<p>That said, this is where privacy and security collide. Since logs going back months of what everyone has done on every system really helps reconstruct things, but of course if you have those logs it means that someone else can abuse them.",1374454799

I was addressing the second part of your comment not your questioning of allowing nulls.<p>Nulls have their place I believe, but they are grossly overused.  For example, if you have a Person table, then something like a nullable DateDied is logical and acceptable over a sub-type solution.  But something like HairColor should not be nullable to cater for bald people, it should non-nullable and reference a table that has a &#x27;none&#x27; value.<p>On another note, I don&#x27;t think you can eliminate the null concept because they are the implicit outcome of outer joins and therefore means of comparing and aggregating nulls needs to built in.",1374454788

Community soccer, basketball, baseball, once or twice a week.

Then there is a problem with the central argument. For regular files, and in fact all method of creating file descriptor, <i>except</i> pipes, opening in RW mode creates a single descriptor. The reason for pipe() special behaior is two pronged:<p>1. The raison d&#x27;être of pipes is for sequential communication between producer/consumer processes. There is no other reason for their design. As such, it made sense to break the convention of a single FD.<p>2. At the time of their design, the 70s, memory footprint was a crucial part of any design. Thus, sharing buffers between the producer and consumer FD was primordial, and the best way to make it happen is to create the FD at the same time.<p>The other problem is that the pipe analogy for TCP is wrong. Which client / server protocol over TCP ever had single direction data transfer? Close to 100% of all TCP usages are between a single client and a single server, communicating both ways.<p>The design for socket is practical for their intended purpose.

Why is using NULLs <i>easier</i>, such that it&#x27;s the &quot;lazy&quot; thing you can &quot;succumb&quot; to? UI is fundamentally about <i>incentives</i>--making good things easy to do, and bad things hard--and an API, or a protocol, is a UI for programmers.<p>Sure, instead of a NULLable column, you can have a pair of columns, one with an ENUM type to represent the sum-typeclass&#x27;s type-instance, and the other to represent a value of that type. But that sounds like you&#x27;re working at the wrong level of abstraction, fundamentally.<p>You&#x27;re using an RBDMS because it lets you speak in terms of tuples, relations, projections, and other Relational Algebra concepts, rather than in terms of keys, values, and indexes. I can see doing the pair-of-columns thing in a NoSQL store--but why did the designers of SQL let this implementation detail infect my RDBMS?<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny, actually. I see developers treating their RDBMS as a dumb object store... but then implementing a &quot;domain model&quot; layer right beyond it, basically creating a &quot;model server&quot; accessible over an API, which enforces the <i>business domain</i> constraints on the objects it sends and receives. In other words, they&#x27;ve Greenspunned an RDBMS of their own in all but name, with its own custom protocol and half-assed validation logic. I feel like a large reason for this is that current RDBMSes just aren&#x27;t up to representing the types and constraints and relations that developers need to express, so they put up their noses and say &quot;business logic doesn&#x27;t belong in the database!&quot; ...and proceed to build a database for their business logic to reside in.<p>It&#x27;s times like this when I almost get an urge to develop my own RDBMS that actually keeps the Relational-Algebra abstraction clean. No concept of a &quot;table&quot; or a &quot;view&quot; or an &quot;index&quot;; just relations between projections of an infinite theoretical tuplespace, where tables are created to store data that can&#x27;t be inferred from an existing view, and garbage-collected behind the scenes when their values are no longer referenced by any projection. Indexes created gradually when a tracing-JIT-like query planner notices repeated access patterns. Strong, structural, parametric type declarations on every piece of data. Constraints that actually allow you to express things like &quot;a user-to-user &#x27;friend&#x27; relationship must be symmetric&quot;, rather than just being a weak declarative dress over triggers. Etc.<p>Would anyone be interested in such a beast?",1374453322

Store each user&#x27;s key, transformed in such a way that you could get it back only if you have the password. Serve the key to the user&#x27;s session on login (maybe -- depending on how long you store the session, you may want to require password reentry to initiate any charges). Encrypt all sensitive data with the user&#x27;s key, such that only that logged in user can read it back.<p>The major drawback would be the same as the benefit. Since you can&#x27;t know your users&#x27; CC numbers, you also can&#x27;t make recurring charges.<p>Pipe-dream solution to that -- you should be able to get a token from your payment provider that authorizes you and only you to charge the CC. Should that token leak, you barely even need to revoke it. It can&#x27;t be used by anyone else, because you need both the token and your company&#x27;s api secret to charge anything, and even then, all they can do is send (easily refundable) money to your account.",1374452637

Although even in the US how the US economy ran under the New Deal/Square Deal/Great Society into the 1960s is different than how it is now.<p>As far as liberal democracy...the FRG reinstated the Nazi ban on voting for the communist party...some democracy - you&#x27;re OK, as long as you vote for a pro-capitalist party.  This was a time when French and Italian workers almost voted in communist governments, something American&#x27;s today tend to forget.  The FRG&#x27;s federal Intelligence service was run by Reinhard Gehlen and his crew, the  Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations and  Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Association were run by former SS officer Hanns-Martin Schleyer (later kidnapped and killed by the Red Army Faction).  Not all that much changed in western Germany after 1945.",1374451573

There are bonds of friendship, but between people of comparable social class and experience. There is nothing that binds me to the people in my neighborhoods, etc, at least nothing that compares to the depth of the ties my wife experiences in her religious community.<p>Re: (2), it is an interesting open question to me. I don&#x27;t yearn for the spiritual aspect of religion. I don&#x27;t fear death, I don&#x27;t lack any sense of purpose, etc. I do lament not being able to participate in the communal aspect of religion. I haven&#x27;t encountered any secular alternative. I&#x27;ll give an example: my wife had our daughter dedicated in her church. I have encountered nothing like that in the secular realm. Maybe you can offer a baby shower as an example, but our baby shower would involve other upper middle class people, not a broad cross-section of the people who live near us.",1374451410

They are currently used in prototyping labs or for niche hobbies, but not in most businesses who could use them.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect consumer adoption soon if I don&#x27;t yet see, say, small household electronics repair shops using a 3d printer to make spare plastic parts on the spot instead of keeping inventory or long waits for deliveries; or tacky accessory/imitation jewelry stores printing rings/whatever out of metallic substrates with custom sizes and coloring right after order, or stores that sell handheld items (any, from computer mice to firearms) offering to print custom grips to match your hand exactly.<p>If I&#x27;d want to do business with 3d printing, then I&#x27;d start with such B2B usecases; or wait for the &quot;right time to swing&quot; at consumer market after this professional market is already full.<p>By the way, &quot;designing a 3d model&quot; is out of pretty much any of these usecases, the model is either premade by others or generated by specific software from some scans/measurements; and there could be a lot of money in making this software or models for the many businesses that want to sell stuff, not design it. On the other hand, building stuff &quot;on order&quot; is speed sensitive as if you can do it with a waiting time comparable to, say, Starbucks, then you open up much more business models than if customers need to wait an hour for the printing.",1374451396

9592129,comment,9591650,9591650,0,0,logn,,,"The talking points that keep coming up in discussions about reform center on metadata and phone records. This is only a small part of the story and I wish groups like EFF would do a better job publicizing the rest of what Snowden disclosed. And the pro-liberty talking heads feel the need to tell us everyday that metadata matters and surveillance is bad which hampers their ability to ever get any other message into the discussion.<p>Also regarding metadata, if we don&#x27;t even have a definition of what it is, that&#x27;s quite worrying. For instance, you could take my comment, run it through an NLP summarizer, AI sentiment analysis, etc (along with cross-referencing back to everything else I&#x27;ve ever written and analyzing that). I.e., they could be generating their own metadata which is basically the data, but more useful.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if metadata is construed to mean that it&#x27;s the actual text/content since it&#x27;s metadata to other data (just depends on your frame of reference).",1432360720

9592127,comment,9591739,9592073,0,0,agwa,,,"Java, before version 8, couldn&#x27;t handle DH parameters larger than 1024 bits, so that may be a motive.  But I suspect a large part of it has to do with the fact that OpenSSL left DH parameter configuration (also ECDH curve selection) up to application developers, who don&#x27;t really have the qualifications to make an intelligent choice.  As a result, some applications make the administrator provide their own DH parameters file (and if you don&#x27;t, no DH for you), others just hard code parameters (usually 1024 bits long, or 512 bits if the export flag is set) into their source code, and others dynamically generate them (and may or may not let you specify the length to generate).  Unfortunately, this means that it&#x27;s not a question of what OpenSSL can do to mitigate this, but what every single server application using OpenSSL has to do.",1432360707

The $700 is what we get to hold onto most often, unless we are saving towards big repairs like new roof, outside paint, etc.  And (crucially) I left out that we had enough first year expenses to legitimately lower that perceived income, as well as the interest that we get to deduct (interest being far higher at first in a mortgage payment).  Next tax year will have different numbers, since we will have had different expenses and different occupancy (unfortunately they do not stay 100% occupied).<p>I am just trying to get out round numbers that show that it can work.<p>Most people have this concept that their house is their biggest asset, when a residence is really a liability for the person who lives in it.<p>I should not have taken the shortcuts in my math, but regardless, we do well.  We have used the profits to invest in more education, and have recently purchased another unit in Florida that will start cash flowing in about two more months.  Well, actually it cash flows now, but we had to pay for some new appliances, so in my head, we are negative for two more months, then we start paying off ourselves for the down payment.  Again, I am more conservative.<p>So it is a slow path to wealth, but a valid path, nonetheless.",1432360698

Those egregious violations of human rights need to be prosecuted, not &quot;reformed&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any part of the PATRIOT ACT that is &quot;uncontroversial&quot; the entire thing should god.  The claim that it will cause &quot;utter chaos&quot; is kinda silly.  We didn&#x27;t have utter chaos before it was law.  IF you think there are bad side effects people don&#x27;t want, then name them.<p>Too many people think that government is a good thing and that most of what they do isn&#x27;t evil, and thus they just give the benefit of the doubt time and time again.  Well, you may not be doing that, and that might even be true for the government as a whole, but the PATRIOT ACT does not deserve the benefit of the doubt-- the provisions that are clearly abusive and extremely offensive to the constitution show that none of it deserves the benefit of the doubt.<p>I looked at the section titles of your wikipedia article on it, and all of them are either criminal acts for government to do or administrative enabling of criminal acts.<p>What the Church Commission confirmed is what the founders knew, which was that a federal &quot;law enforcement&quot; agency would become the secret police, and that&#x27;s why they forbade it in the constitution:<p>The only enumerated power for such enforcement is here:\n&quot;To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations;&quot;<p>Everything else, and including everyone involved in propagating these crimes, should be prosecuted.  Their crimes are felonies if committed while armed, under USC 18-242.<p>So yes, repealing the PATRIOT ACT doesn&#x27;t go far enough, the government has been abusing its powers since nearly the late 1700s.",1432360503

9592075,comment,9589039,9589610,0,0,greenyoda,,,"<i>&quot;I am not sure how well this would work in the US as apparently you can be charged for inbound calls there.&quot;</i><p>Right, in the U.S. you&#x27;re charged for &quot;air time&quot; on both outbound and inbound mobile calls. However, the trick would work with land-lines, and is especially useful when one party has a calling plan with flat-rate monthly billing and the other pays per-call. I had some family members who did this many years ago, long before there were mobile phones.<p>Answering machines (for land lines) are also designed to exploit the &quot;missed call&quot; trick: if I call my home answering machine to remotely retrieve my messages, it will answer on the first ring if I have messages, otherwise it will answer on the fourth ring. Thus, if it rings twice, I can hang up, having learned that I have no messages without having paid for a call. (Even if I&#x27;m calling from a mobile phone and paying for the call, I&#x27;ve spent much less time to find out that I have no messages.)<p>The only problem with this scheme is that it&#x27;s somewhat unreliable. The &quot;ring tone&quot; that the caller hears is generated by their local exchange, and doesn&#x27;t exactly correspond to the ring on the callee&#x27;s phone, which is generated by the remote exchange. So the caller may hear a ring tone and hang up before the callee ever hears a ring. (At least that&#x27;s the way it works in the U.S.) So it&#x27;s probably more reliable to hang up after the caller hears two ring tones.",1432358497

Nevertheless, couldn&#x27;t this be mitigated somewhat by having openssl[1] dynamically generate dhparams?  Isn&#x27;t that what they do for ECDHE?  1024 bit DHE would still be crackable by the NSA, but with dynamic params it would take much longer since they wouldn&#x27;t get to precompute anything.<p>[1] Do schannel and other ssl implementations use static dh parameters by default, like openssl does, or do they dynamically generate them?  And do they default to 1024 bit or are they smarter about it and default to match the RSA key size?",1432358442

I think the contention is that having a subgroup in society with 1% of their people willing to kill cannot possibly be contained by a police force, and cannot possibly peacefully exist alongside other groups.<p>Add to that the fact that 50% or more of those muslims will protect the 1% extremists from the police force in all but the most offensive cases.<p>Let&#x27;s face facts here : islam is a religion that was created in a massive war, that is on occasion blamed for starting the dark ages by cutting off all sea based trade in Western Europe and more than half of land based trade. The ideology internalized war during it&#x27;s formation period. Hell, in the hadith you find plenty of references why the early caliphs &quot;chose&quot; islam, and the reason was they were at war. The religion survived only because it could convince large amounts of people to fight anyone else around them. Further in it&#x27;s history it spread by war and it is absolutely unique in the sheer amount of genocides that just happened to take place just at the edge of islam, at the point where it was spreading. The biggest slaughter in history, the Mongol conquest of India, with the lower end of death toll estimates at over 3 times the WWII total death toll (over 30 times bigger than the holocaust), and may have killed half a billion (close to 100 holocausts), was an islamic expansion war.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t worry about them going to the middle east - or anywhere - that&#x27;s temporary. This will spread, and the time will come when the fight is simply local.<p>THAT is the contention.",1432358355

Asset values no longer have any relation to local economics, in <i>various</i> different ways.   In the US in the housing bubble, it was loose credit.

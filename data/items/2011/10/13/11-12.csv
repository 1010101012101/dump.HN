Find a problem.\nAsk pointed questions, but if you get too specific you'll only cheat yourself.  Example (to steal someone else's) is the dog nail clippers.  If you ask ""What troubling you these days?"" they can say anything from the market to the weather.    If you say ""What's troubling you about dog maintenance?"" you can probably end up with nail clippers.  If you ask ""What's troubling you with cutting your dog's nails?"" you've shot yourself in the foot.<p>As far as criteria for startup goes it went something like this<p>1) Billion+ dollar market.  1% of a billion is still a million.<p>2) Growing at 5% a year.  Even if you do nothing your business is growing.<p>3) Money is spent on it already.  No one spends money on it?  You're either a genius or no one cares. For instance, deodorant. Somehow some people convinced us all that we need to smell good, so we need deodorant.  So while you could make the next deodorant odds are you're not.  As a corollary  to this there will be competition.<p>4) Control your own distribution. For example: Magazines are difficult to sell. It's $$$ upfront to even put your magazine on the rack in a store, and they don't guarantee sales.  You don't want this.<p>5...) Find some criteria that you would be happy with on a personal level.  It could be that you reject running a business a certain way (""It has to be moral in this way"") or   something like that. Don't limit yourself to one technology or revenue stream.<p>Now go through your list of problems and find something that matches all these criteria. Pick something that matches.<p>Are their multiple matches?  Pick whichever you feel strongest about.<p>2 or more tied?  Pick one at random.  You made the criteria because anything that matched it would be something that you would be happy doing and would be a good business.  So just pick something and go do it.<p>Disclaimer:  Even if you do all this, you could still fail, but you've just reduced the odds compared to every guy with an idea looking for a problem.",1318505368

It reminds me of both the dotcom and property bubbles and before it was obvious these were unraveling how people defended their positions.  The biggest thing I get reminded of is those who bought property on credit at high values with the intention to flip them quickly at a profit.  This reminds me of those who raise a lot of money for a company in order to flip it to the next guy.  These are the people who will attack any perceived coming decline the hardest.  They will tell you that this time it's different because 1% of China is now online.  That technology is here to stay and will always grow and so will the market, with mobiles etc.  This is true, but so was it true during the dotcom bubble.  We got the timing wrong, and we got the business models wrong for sure.<p>In reality, like after the dotcom bubble, there are startups that formed over the recent years that will survive all this and be as well known as the giants we have today that formed during the dotcom era.

3106821,comment,3105182,3105983,1,0,lien,,,"well, arduino can only take you so far and is limited in where you could go. I've known arduino as a prototyping platform only and there's very little you can go after that.<p>I'd start with the EVK because it has the temperature and light sensor on the board built in. GainSpan did a demo recently to control the board over an iPhone. This is something you can only do with Wi-Fi.<p>Well, once the prototype is done, you should be able to buy the module and look into the module datasheet to develop your own products. Also, note that GainSpan modules currently work with Freescale MCUs so you get access to their customer support team as well. (Basically you could turn on the ARM core in the GainSpan chip or use an external MCU.)",1318504352

These protesters love to scream about Wall Street all while tweeting about it on their computers that were built by companies that are traded on Wall Street. Many of the people that read HN are hoping to one day have an IPO -- all handled by those same banks that are supposedly 'bad.' Perhaps they should e protesting the Solyndra loans where billions was given to a company because they bribed the right people in the White House.<p>I support people's right to express their opinion, but when hypocrisy such as demonstrated by these protests reaches this level, I have to call bullsh#t.<p>I would much rather see a 'Smaller Government Tea Party Hackathon' or perhaps an Occupy the White House Hackathon. The problem isn't the banks it's the government. A government that feels like profits are something to be punished when in fact, profits are the reason innovation happens. No one is forced to have a Bank of America account, but all Americans are forced to pay for bad policies every day. Any time the SIEU is involved in a protest you know the motives are suspect.",1318504160

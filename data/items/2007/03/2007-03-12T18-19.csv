3760,comment,3727,3739,0,0,Readmore,,,"I agree that his views on schools doesn't really translate to coding. The author talks about the prestige of programming being low, which in IT it is, but there are obviously coders that have prestige. John Carmack, for one, is very highly regarded in the computer science field, but he never went to a prestigious CS school. What I find interesting is that programmers only get prestige from actually DOING something. This can happen at a big company but more often than not it happens at a startup. Lawyers and Doctors 'get' their prestige from going to school and getting their title, whether it is deserved or not, but programmers have to earn it through solving problems. I find that much more rewarding, it will mean much more for me to be prestigous because of my work than because of where I went to school. ",1173724904

3757,comment,3712,3712,0,0,pixcavator,,,"That seems like a good idea. But what I think is missing in Photoshop is image analysis features. These features will allow you to take image editing to an entirely different level. This is a self-promotion, of course Â– you can read about some of these features at Pixcavator.com. I have been working on a technology for computer vision/image mining/image search, but recently I realized that being able to analyze the image gives you totally new tools for image manipulation. If somebody is interested in pursuing this, write me a couple of lines.

3753,comment,3746,3746,0,0,danielha,,,"The mind sharing concept is interesting. I see an inherent flaw in the ""traditional model"" that you posted:<p>---<p>Advertiser posts ad<p>Consumer views ad  <p>Advertiser pays media <p>---<p>You missed a crucial detail: the advertiser posts the ad to the media to publish. It's a critical detail that bridges the next step.<p>When a potential customer sits and views your ad for a set wage, it's much different than encountering the ad in a targeted environment. I noticed the targeted aspect of your service, but it's difficult to gauge its effectiveness just yet. As an advertising medium, I'm skeptical. The concept definitely has merit in getting something of yours read or viewed.

After reading this, though, I decided to make a list of the web applications that I have actually paid for.  I could only think of one- it was one of the ediet ones that lets you pick your diet (out of many popular ones) then emails you meal plans and shopping lists each week.  I'm not even on a diet.<p>The fact that it saved me time and thought thinking through healthy meals was what got me to pay.  And it made me realize also how few web apps actually end up saving me time in the end (which is the make-it or break-it factor for me, but I realize probably not for others).<p>So here's my question- what web apps have you other news.YC'ers ever actually paid money for?  Any?",1173723919

3748,comment,3727,3727,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I personally love programming.  I'd gotten to a point a few years ago in my career where I moved out of programming roles only to discover that I missed it.  Helping my younger brother through a CS programming really got me going again, and I credit that experience with getting me going on a startup.<p>That said, sure there's very little cool about being programmer #45 for an insurance company.  The truly gifted developers need to be at a software firm, a consulting company (more new dev, less maintenance), working on an open source project, or (best yet) creating their own software.

3747,comment,3714,3714,0,0,jwecker,,,"nice post.  In my experience also the lowest paying accounts are the most difficult to maintain- out of proportion certainly to the revenue they bring in.  However, one thing it didn't mention here is to remember not to discount market share.  In lots of apps the higher subscription plans will only be upsales- no one will jump straight into the business account, for example.  And in some cases your low paying accounts are doing a lot of evangelizing for your product, or not using a competitors product, etc.  Keep it balanced, for sure, but get lots of users.",1173722903

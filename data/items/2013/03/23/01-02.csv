We're not in as deep is as America is (from my basic understanding of our benefits vs. American welfare) but if the government were to talk about the problems with Incapacity Benefit they would also have to address the problem of <i>another</i> 2 million unemployed people with no recent job history and no jobs for them even if they could work.<p>Things are just about ticking over now, imagine the shit storm that would occur if every unemployed person was told they're now competing with another 2 million people, keeping this a ""secret"" is as much in the governments interest as it is every person that votes.

Otherwise I worry that I may have reviewed the evidence but drawn a completely wrong conclusion.<p>But it seems that most of the people involved in the discussions I read want to have an emotional argument, unsupported by any explainable moral or legal framework.<p>And that annoys me to no end because our current legal framework seems to be a pretty good one for most parts of the discussion. Can someone be fired for telling a sexual joke at a conference? Yes. Most employment is at-will, telling sexual jokes is not a protected action, and there's nothing which implies that it's a pretext for some other protected action. Can someone take a picture of others at a Python conference, without their permission? Yes, excepting certain narrow legal limits.<p>Can someone 'name and shame'? Yes, truthful accounts are protected under the First Amendment. Is ""name and shame"" ethical? The law just says that it's legal, since there's no slander involved. But I don't want to get into the name-and-shame topic because a quick scan shows that there's no effective way to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable publish shaming and still have free speech rights. At least, I can't come up with one and no one has described one that looks the first bit achievable.<p>Is it okay to fire someone who files a report about sexual discrimination? Only if it's a false or spurious report, and the benefit of the doubt is given to the person who makes the report. Otherwise it's a protected action. Can someone be fired for not being ""unprofessional""? Yes, unless it's a pretext for retaliation against a protected action, in which case the answer is no.<p>See, with the law in mind this discussion seems a whole lot easier. And with it in mind the questions are things like ""what moral principles should guide changes to the law?"", ""how would changes to the law affect previous decisions?"", and ""what can we do to improve things without changing the law?""<p>But saying, eg, that it's acceptable to fire Richards for taking pictures of people at a conference without their permission is to ignore the law and society expectations entirely and to live in a fantasy world.<p>What do I do? I'm a self-employed person who writes software for the computational chemistry industry. I'm also a member of the PSF, which is the organization that sponsors PyCon. Over the last few years, we've been struggling with having a code of conduct for meetings like this. As such, I have a personal interest in understanding what went on, so that I might be involved in affecting change. Before last week, I had very little interest in this topic.<p>And as for argumentum verbosium, were it so easy. Then I would just ask to highlight the flaws in my fallacious logic and be done with it. But, no, I have a chronic case of logorrhoea.

With that in mind, I think the data in Ireland supports the grandparent's claim that anti-abortion is a right wing movement in Europe.<p>I think perhaps the confusion here is due to the fact that the Irish don't see themselves as being divided according to the French tradition of left and right, but according to which side of the civil war they think was right.<p>It's perhaps instructive to note that the people and organisations that oppose abortion in Ireland today are often the same ones that supported Franco's rebellion during the Spanish civil war and that both things were supported for the same reason: catholicism.

5426868,comment,5424671,5424671,4,0,freework,,,"My best interview advice is this: Don't ask questions to judge, ask to learn.<p>A lot of interviewers have an interview process that is mainly designed to eliminate candidates. Therefore, the process contains interviewers asking ""fake questions"" that are designed to trip up candidates and eliminate them. An example is a question like ""How would you design a database engine"". If I really had to build a database engine, the context and details of that situation would dictate how this database system should be approached.<p>Instead you should ask questions to learn. If you ask me what a cache is, you better be asking me because you don't know what a cache is. If thats the case, I'd love to explain it to you, because I like teaching people things. Its very awkward to explain something to somebody that obviously knows that concept very well.<p>When you ask questions like that, you end up subconsciously comparing candidates by their explanation of cache matching up with how you would describe cache. In other words, this process favors people who think the same. A team full of people who all think the same is a company that has many weaknesses. A strong company has people who approach problems differently. You need people who approach life differently.

But if we do follow the party risks losing control.<p>That was not the bind Deng Xiaoping faced.  He took over china right after the cultural revolution which occurred right after the ""Great leap forward"".  He had a floundering nation that he needed to jump start.  State controlled capitalism is the answer to that problem, and fits well with the Socialism narrative (i.e building capital, is the first stage before sharing it).<p>> Deng did take the risk and the loss of control seemed to be offset - however this time the rifts in the party are deeper, the gulf between rich and poor wider.<p>This again misrepresents the facts.

5426851,comment,5424241,5424773,6,0,wyager,,,"There is some strange mental block that makes it difficult for people to understand that technological progress does not and will not result in mass unemployment.<p>Here's a clearer example with humans instead of horses:\n200 years ago, Shoemaking was one of the world's largest industries. Today, it represents a very small fraction of the world economy and almost all shoemakers have been replaced by machines.<p>What happened?<p>As shoemaking machines became commonplace, shoemakers were suddenly unable to compete. Some of them found other jobs, some of them became destitute. Most were probably able to keep shoemaking until they retired, as the shoemaking machines took a while to roll out.<p>However, the Shoemakers' children and other children in that generation were perfectly aware that shoemaking was no longer a viable industry. No one born after the popularization of shoemaking machines studied to become a shoemaker.<p>What is the result?<p>First, we now have less expensive, higher-quality shoes. This is not always an effect of mechanization, but it usually is. Second, we don't have mass unemployment.<p>Why do we not have mass unemployment? Because when you replace workers with less expensive machines, one of two things happen; either the factory owner makes more money, or shoes start to cost less. If the factory owner makes more money, they spend it on a yacht or something. If the shoes cost less, the consumers have more money to spend on food or books or whatever.<p>So, there are now very few people employed in the shoemaking industry, but all the shoemakers' children can now go into the expanding yacht-making or food-cooking or book-printing industries.<p>Recap: Mechanization does not cause long-term unemployment. At worst, it causes unemployment for a single generation of workers. Ultimately, decreasing costs in one industry contribute to the growth of other industries (either via increased profits for the wealthy or decreased costs for the non-wealthy), so there is not a significant net change in employment.",1364001520

So, where in Django, you might execute a .save() on a model to commit it to the database, that same .save() operation in backbone will execute a PUT or PATCH request to your API endpoint to which its bound.",1364000563

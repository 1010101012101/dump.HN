In my position I would be worried about the following:<p>- hiring - will I be able to find talented people to work on the codebase? Especially if I am not located in a startup hub.<p>- Scaling - I haven't seen many sites using scheme or other flavors of Lisp that are able to scale. As a management type I would want to see more than just 3 or 4 sites that have scaled well.<p>- available libraries - the more traction a language has, the more libraries will be available for it. Can a (supposedly) better language make up for this?<p>And yes - I have read Paul Graham's essays on the subject and find them insightful, but since I am sure that almost all hackers have and I see no large sites written in anything but mainstream languages I am not convinced.<p>Disclaimer: I am in management, and I am merely curious - not bashing scheme or any other flavor of lisp.

(ducks)<p>Steve Jobs has done an amazing job turning around the company and much of this enthusiasm is warranted.  However, the stock got way ahead of itself.<p>I considered shorting the stock also, but that is just way too risky.  A stock only has to double to wipe out the entire investment.  And, if a stock is already irrationally high, it could very well go substantially higher in the short term.  However, put options may be a good way to bet on the downside while limiting risk.<p>At this point, I do think they are pretty close to an appropriate valuation.

Well, that's just a DSL - pg is always saying ""write a language for the problem, then write your program in that language"".  That's about as small as you can get.  Other views of the same problem are accidental complexity or Steve Yegge's rants about code compression (Java vs Ruby/Javascript vs Lisp).<p>As far as your stock market example, you could use a genetic algorithm to predict a formula to invest with.

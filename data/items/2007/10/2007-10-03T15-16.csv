It's an incredible user experience.  It lets them in on the excitement.  It gives them a story to tell others.  That's why they want in.<p>And no, it's not ""cheap"" to give them a discount, it's rewarding them for faith and it's fair.  (You can think of it as interest if you'd like.)  It's also fairly standard practice.<p>Do it right, and they'll be out there selling more ""pre-release"" subscriptions for you.  Deliver, and they'll be your best salesfolk.<p>Of course, it is poor form to take their money if you're not going to deliver.

Sorry for the misunderstanding.<p>""most programmers are clueless on the UI side anyways and would be happy to offload that stuff""<p>Where are you meeting programmers?  This statement is troubling to me on multiple levels.  A web app is a holistic organism.  ""Offloading"" or decoupling UI from server side processing is a recipe for an incongruent app.  Maybe you need to find less clueless programmers.

62608,comment,62519,62557,0,0,imgabe,,,"It is a one size fits all kind of deal. You just have to  try putting it on the right appendage. The difference here is that surgery is a service and software is a product. I think that basically they're the same. You ""develop"" a service the same way you would develop a product. You practice. In effect, practice is the iterative design of a service, just like rapid prototyping is the iterative design of a product.<p>Now, the surgeon can't just crack open your head and see what happens, but before he ever does that he's going to have practiced cracking open heads and mucking about with them somewhere (probably on a cadaver). He's probably going to have made some mistakes doing it too, and learned from them the right way to go about cutting up people's brains. <p>Likewise, you don't just ship the first piece of software you scribble out and see what happens either. Now, certainly with a web 2.0 AJAX calendar-organizer-automated-fish-feeder there's a greater margin for error than brain surgery, but it's a difference in degree, not in kind. If you launch a site that just returns ""Internal Server Error"" when someone surfs to it, you're going to be about as successful as a brain surgeon who never learned how to handle a scalpel.<p>So the surgeon cutting up a cadaver seems to me to be the same as a programmer blasting out a broken version 1.0 of his software. They're both trying something out in a situation where they can fix mistakes and reincorporate them to product. The surgeon makes a cut, looks to see if it's in the right place and is the right size, if not he keeps trying until he gets it right. When he can make the right cut every time without thinking about it, his service of cutting people is finished being developed. Likewise, the programmer writes some code, and checks if it produces the right output. If not, he tweaks the code until it does. Same thing. You can't compare a finished version of one product (performing brain surgery) to the development process of another product (writing software).",1191425100

One of the main fears/complaints of programmers in startups (without funding) is ""will I be doing the majority of the work while everyone else is sitting pretty?"" Even if you (think) that you still suck - it'll still win you respect, not to even your start is off and running.<p>Personally ""programming"" to me includes good knowledge of UI related stuff like css AND javascript, both of which the typical hacker knows little of (at least in my experience hackers typically suck at implementing and designing UI). If you have knowledge of that - probably no real need to learn python, ruby, or x language...<p>""5.

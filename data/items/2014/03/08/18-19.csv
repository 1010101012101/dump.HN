7365969,comment,7365354,7365804,5,0,intelliot,,,"It&#x27;s too early for anyone to say whether this concern is a real problem, but here are a few points that you should analyze further:<p>1) ASICs. In the early days of Bitcoin, one of the biggest concerns was: &quot;Now that computational power is worth real money, aren&#x27;t malicious hackers going to become rich and powerful by harnessing botnets? And more normal people&#x27;s computers will join botnets as hackers are directly incentivized, by bitcoin mining, to exploit users more often.&quot;<p>With the rise of the Bitcoin-specific ASIC, that suddenly became a total non-issue. It&#x27;s completely worthless for a normal desktop PC to mine for bitcoins now: their total computational power, as measured in SHA256 hashes per second, is a tiny drop in the ocean compared to the high-end ASICs that are mining today.<p>Problem solved.<p>Though governments will try to get involved, and no one can definitively predict the winner in advance -- I believe it&#x27;s most likely that private industry, incentivized by Bitcoin&#x27;s mining rewards, will create the most advanced specialized chips for Bitcoin. They&#x27;re already pushing much lower nanometer processes than general purpose CPUs!<p>2) Energy expense of current monetary system. People, computers, ATMs, POS&#x27;s, paper, time expenditure, inflation/hyperinflation, uncertainty, economic/debt crises, counterfeiting, unemployment - all problems that could be reduced or eliminated by Bitcoin.<p>3) Future technology. Before cars were invented, one of the biggest concerns was: &quot;How are we going to get rid of the horse manure that&#x27;s piling up in the world&#x27;s densest cities?&quot;<p>Infrared radiation isn&#x27;t the only way to release heat to space. And even if it were, no one could say that it&#x27;s not possible for humans+technology to amplify/improve this process.",1394305092

7365964,comment,7365382,7365917,4,0,_delirium,,,"On #1, the answer would be yes if they really did co-own it and had no other contract regulating terms of their co-ownership (unlikely). Under U.S. law (not true everywhere!), co-owners of a patent each have an independent right to exploit and/or non-exclusively license the patent, without consultation with the other co-owners, unless they&#x27;ve entered an agreement providing for other terms of co-ownership. This is also true for copyrights on jointly authored work, incidentally.<p>However, companies usually just get the patent assigned to them by the employee, in return for some token compensation (varies, sometimes it&#x27;s really token, like $1, other companies will pay employees $100-$1000 per patent).<p>One place where it can sometimes come up is that a co-inventor who was omitted from the patent application can later try to get him/herself retroactively added. Trying to dig up such people, get them added, and then buy a license from that person is one strategy for defending a patent lawsuit. E.g. if IBM bought a patent from a university spinoff, you could try to dig up a grad student who can document he/she co-invented the relevant technology but wasn&#x27;t listed on the patent, get them added, then license it from them. Since they now co-own the patent with IBM, you only need to license it from either them <i>or</i> IBM, so IBM&#x27;s suit fails. I think doing this successfully is pretty rare, but there&#x27;s a fairly famous case: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8929550350181055569"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8929550350181055...</a>",1394304996

Nobody has any problems with this, the education doesn&#x27;t lack because of it. So the problem does not lie in testing, but it might lie in what you test for, and how the teachers perceive what the most efficient way of teaching is.</i><p>I think you may not be able to fully relate to how different American-style standardized testing is from the tests you are used to and what they do the education system because of how incentives are structured. Compare, for example, questions on the French Bac [1] with SAT questions [2]. Even though both supposedly test preparedness for college, there is a world of a difference between the two.<p>Testing is generally a crucial part of any education system; it provides feedback, incentives, and a lot of other things. There is absolutely nothing wrong with testing as such. There is a lot wrong with US-style standardized testing.<p>First of all, much of US standardized testing is not about evaluating students, but about evaluating schools and teachers (this is alluded to in the article). Schools may lose funding and teachers may even lose their jobs because of poor performance on standardized tests. This is why the school in the article is in such a state of panic over even just one family avoiding the tests and which is also why students could opt out in the first place (because it isn&#x27;t really about the students).<p>As a consequence, this creates strong incentives to make sure that test results are good, no matter how that is accomplished. (In some extreme – and rare – cases, there have been teachers and schools with knowledge of tests who prepared their students accordingly beforehand.)<p>Because of the nature and design of standardized tests in the US, teaching deep understanding is a poor use of school resources to accomplish this goal; it&#x27;s generally more efficient to fake a sufficient amount of understanding and rely on rote stuff. This, of course, creates a negative feedback loop that affects how material is being taught and – eventually – even how curricula are designed.<p>On top of that, the effort of dealing with standardized testing – especially as pervasive and frequent as it currently is in America – eats up a great many teaching resources.<p>You are of course correct that standardized tests couldn&#x27;t be a problem without other parts of the education system creating negative feedback loops. For example, in the US, teachers are underpaid relative to other professionals with graduate degrees [5], and given the degree of inequality in America and the cost of a college degree, this creates a strong incentive for the best and the brightest among a generation to do something other than teaching. This in turn means that schools are trying to weed out the poor teachers, and the methods for that tend to punish the good teachers and the students as well.<p>(I note that European systems have plenty of problems of their own, such as the myriad of issues with badly thought out approaches to tracking [3] that many European countries have [4]. But these are independent problems.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://gfbrandenburg.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/a-look-at-one-version-of-this-years-french-math-baccalaureat-exam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gfbrandenburg.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/a-look-at-one-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-practice-questions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-practice-questions</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(education)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(education)</a><p>[4] It&#x27;s not that tracking as such is harmful – not all students are alike, after all –, but many implementations of tracking are harmful in that they further social segregation or create incentives for good teachers to work at upper tier schools, leaving lower tier schools with poorer teachers.<p>[5] To be clear, US teachers are generally not poorly paid. But with a graduate degree, they can earn more – generally much more – elsewhere, which leads to a sort of brain drain out of the education system.",1394304130

Here is an old IRC log extract I pulled out for someone else who didn&#x27;t believe this: <a href=""https://people.xiph.org/~greg/brainwallet.txt*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/brainwallet.txt*</a><p>   More recently he really was in IRC asking for information on faster cracking mechanisms, right after whining about needing money. But uh, he might have just been trying to further convince himself that brainwallets really are secure and that it&#x27;s really the users fault (or a MITM on the site) when they get robbed.<p>   I&#x27;m less inclined to assume malice, and more inclined to assume that he&#x27;s clueless— both of the insecurity of these schemes, the acceptability of blaming the victims when users inevitably choose poor keys, and how scammy his own actions look. But thats just my own impression.<p>  When you choose to use something like that you should start with the assumption that the creator is malicious and ask yourself why its safe to use anyways. For the Bitcoin reference software you can point to the large amount of open public review, processes which prove the binaries agree with the source, etc. For brainwallet.org? Not much.<p>  So if ever you find the prospect that the creator of something might be a bit black-hat and this concerns you thats potentially a red-flag.&quot;</i><p> <p>Probably more concerning, the first &quot;random&quot; key the website displays is &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot;, which people get their funds stolen from almost constantly.<p><a href=""http://blockr.io/address/info/1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blockr.io/address/info/1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3L...</a>",1394304065

And sometimes kids need to hear that, or they have no reason to step up.</i><p>This could apply to boys as well as girls, and indeed to anyone at just about any age; sometimes we need to be told that we&#x27;re not measuring up. I am reminded of Philip Greenspun&#x27;s story about the venture capitalists who wrecked ArsDigita, the company he had built (from <a href=""http://waxy.org/random/arsdigita/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waxy.org/random/arsdigita/</a>):<p><i>[F]or most of this year Chip, Peter, and Allen [the VC Board members and CEO] didn&#x27;t want to listen to me. They even developed a theory for why they didn&#x27;t have to listen to me: I&#x27;d hurt their feelings by criticizing their performance and capabilities; self-esteem was the most important thing in running a business; ergo, because I was injuring their self-esteem it was better if they just turned a deaf ear. I&#x27;m not sure how much time these three guys had ever spent with engineers. Chuck Vest, the president of MIT, in a private communication to some faculty, once described MIT as &quot;a no-praise zone&quot;. My first week as an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student I asked a professor for help with a problem.

2226018,comment,2225884,2225884,0,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Experts Exchange's need to talk about Stack Overflow is a sign of the shifting dynamic between the two sites and that they feel the need to make it negative indicates, to me at least, the relative strength of the two sites.<p>The issue is that EE is having to justify $12.95 a month worth of value over SO and, as a user of both sites, it seems to me that for a vast majority of people that value simply doesn't exist.  Yes there is a free option but it's so badly hidden that it's clearly not something they have any real interest in and feels like it's there purely so they can say it's there.  If that's not the case then then put it next to the various paid options.<p>Like many companies before them, they've found that their market has changed.  What was previously a salable product is now something that is available for free (or at least something broadly comparable is available for free).<p>To be clear I have no issue with EE's right to charge for their service, I just think it's doomed to failure when the guy down the road doesn't.<p>There seem to be two options from here:<p>1) Tough it out and hope that SO doesn't last and that they can keep going with their existing business model.  Suggesting that SO is going to run out of money sooner or later is fine.  Maybe it will, maybe it won't but don't expect me to pay for your service while they are there and don't charge.  That's the reality EE needs to deal with and if that's their strategy they need to hunker down and dig deep because it's going to cost them in the short term.<p>2) Look for a new business model.  Either something totally new or at the very least a tweak to what they're doing now.  No idea what it is, if I did I'd probably be doing it myself, but it seems to me that a new reality demands a new model and that simply denying that is railing against the dying of the light.<p>Maybe there is another choice they can look at but whatever it is, I don't think bad mouthing the competition is going to cut it.",1297856786

2225995,comment,2220133,2224767,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"Nginx can have workers, but the default number is one. nginx doesn't need a separate worker per time to handle each request. Anything that happens on a given connection is an event (connected, received some data, finished receiving data, got a response from the backend, closed the connection), and nginx just responds to events in the order received across all connections. It doesn't have to hang out and wait for the client to finish sending it's request, doesn't have to wait for PHP to process the request, just goes about handling the next event until those time-consuming things finish.<p>If you've looked at using PHP with nginx, you might be thinking of the fastcgi workers. Rather than including PHP in the web server process, fastcgi keeps a pool of PHP processes around, and whenever you get a PHP request, nginx passes it off to the fastcgi backend (then goes about other business until the backend responds). I don't know of any reason that PHP run this way should be faster than as an apache module, but the whole system ends up faster because the web server part is using a lot less memory and CPU. And depending on your site, there are some really low hanging optimizations you can do with nginx. E.g., just need a couple of configuration lines to cache all PHP GET requests for 5 min (unless you have cookie X, if you want). Since nginx seriously will not bat an eye over serving a redditing worth of static files, that means even your unoptimized word press site can stand up to the front page no problem. (Not verified from actually attempting it. But I did setup a simple PHP site on a 512 Linode that served 250k page views per day without excessive disk activity or the CPU usage crossing 10%.)",1297856037

Why does a company famous for perfecting the user experience create this roadblock for its users?<p>It is to convert iX(Phone/Pod/Pad) users into iTunes users. You have a revenue stream from iX user for maybe 2 or 3 years . . but you've captured an iTunes user potentially for decades.<p>It's been a long term plan. I remember nearly a decade ago when Apple broke their iPod so that MP3 files couldn't be transferred onto it using the standard USB mechanism. It was no longer an MP3 player - it was a portable iTunes player.<p>The goal is no less than to acquire 30% of the price of every movie, TV show, book, game or any other digital product sold and to make them profitable long after they've stopped innovating.",1297855359

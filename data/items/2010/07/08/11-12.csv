Just tell me how it would work.<p>If it helps, imagine that you run a pharmaceutical firm, and you have the choice to spend hundreds of millions of dollars researching a drug which, once perfected by your researchers, is not owned in any sense (even temporarily) by you, but rather immediately becomes a generic commodity worth fractions of a cent per unit, and which cannot possibly earn you back the money you spent developing it.

Also, the framework has evolved, and a lot of things I had to do by myself at the time are now in the core.<p>In the end, what took me time is: back office stuff (end of day jobs, tracking user actions), design integration (we brought a designer in, though), UI (caching and ajax calls to speedup the site, and effects using scriptaculous), having our email platform good to go through spam filters.<p>Also, even when it seems straightforward, it takes more time than you may think.

Think about it - a drug may be trivially simple to manufacture, the hard part is developing it in the first place then shepherding it through the FDA approval process. So they rely on patents because secrecy at that scale is impossible.<p>For an example closer to home, did you never wonder how RMS working alone was able to put Symbolics out of business? Because he waited for them to discover what users wanted, the hard part, then he simply copied the implementation and gave it away for free.

The controller died while trying repair a degraded array. At this point, we valued the data enough that we weren't going to screw around with replacing the controller and restarting the recovery. The whole RAID array went out to DriveSavers, at the cost of several thousand dollars. Now, DriveSavers are really awesome folks, but my goal is to never do business with them again. :-)<p>After this incident, our policy was simple: If our data mattered, it had to be replicated.<p>A 3 server configuration is, admittedly, pretty high end: Even if one node is down, you still have redundancy. You can keep the remaining 2 nodes live while rebuilding the failed node.<p>I know lots of people who care _deeply_ about data integrity, but who keep their databases on a single server. I find this a bit mystifying: Even the most expensive hardware can die in ugly and unrecoverable ways.

And I suspect, so are you.<p>It looks like you think that for pharmaceutical to thrive, it needs corporation to be ""encouraged"" to invest lots of money.  You also seem to think that patents are a major provider of that encouragement.  If so, the introduction of the patent system should have accelerated innovation.<p>Empirical evidence shows that it didn't.<p>I see only 2 explanations: either patents are not an effective encouragement (compared to already existing ones), or their disadvantages nullifies the additional encouragement.",1278587509
1497012,comment,1496683,1496783,0,0,10ren,,,"Generally speaking, an ""algorithm"" can be implemented in many different ways. A ""piece of software"" is a specific implementation. In patent terminology, a specific implementation is an embodiment of an invention.<p>Implementations can vary in trivial ways (eg. different variable names), substantial ways (eg. different languages), in representation choices (eg. a graph as a list of arcs; as a matrix of connections; as pointers/references from data structure to data structure; using ""pointers"" that are indices into an array etc); in execution choices (recursive; iterative; immutable; mutable); in a million details that are non-significant for the algorithm. Ask two people to implement Dijkstra's algorithm; they're unlikely to produce identical code. (Although, when marking at uni, assignments were often <i>strikingly</i> similar - not always due to cheating, since one of them was almost identical to code I'd written, and no one had seen it. There are often only a few obvious ways to approach a problem and convention dictates the other decisions. But I digress.)",1278587507

I used to examine and grant software patents on behalf of the UKPO (now UKIPO) Comptroller (sic).<p>The UK practice had substantially changed since I left (after Macrossan, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotel_v_Telco_and_Macrossan%27s_Application"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotel_v_Telco_and_Macrossan%2...</a>), the UK Patents Act has harmonising terms such that various sections are interpreted to match EPC articles. In the EU software patents were ruled out ""as such"" and traditionally the loophole was that as long as a ""technical effect"" (beyond that expected from mere computerisation) was demonstrated in the application of a patent then the software patent was allowed.<p>Generally the EPC and UKIPO treatments have differed as software patents were actually ruled out ""per se"" in UK Patents Act 1977 S1(1)(d) referencing 1(2)(c) and UK has been stricter in interpreting this (see Macrossan).<p>UK law also states that [pure] business methods and mathematical algorithms are unpatentable (again Section 1; see examiners manual - <a href=""http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-001.pdf</a>) amongst other things.<p>However historical quirks meant that compression algos were allowed in certain areas (imaging) that wouldn't be allowed unless they were couched in the right way (that's my interpretation, I couldn't understand why they were granted).<p>The Macrossan tests are spelt out clearly in the above Patent Examiner's manual link as is the UK practice (but this can be amended by court decisions).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_the_European_Patent_Convention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_the_Euro...</a> and the corresponding UK page appear to be thorough treatments for those that wish to read more.",1278587397

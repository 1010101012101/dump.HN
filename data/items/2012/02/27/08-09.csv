The idea of an ""online newspaper"" is like a horse-drawn carriage with mechanical horses are powered by gasoline  it obviously should be a car, but that's what you'd end up with if you were too tied to the idea of horses to let it go.<p>The trouble for newspapers is that they're used to having a certain scale and mode of operation. The future of news is small teams running a website with little of the ceremonious structure that defines a newspaper. As long as they're lean, they'll be able to take in enough revenue to keep writers living like writers mostly do today. But I don't think there's any way to squeeze the New York Times into that shape.",1330333189
3638288,comment,3638014,3638236,4,0,DannoHung,,,"I think there is a distinction to be made: While there is value in grasping things that are complicated or hard to understand, there is little value in designing something that is intentionally complicated or hard to understand. In a certain sense, the problem that a tool maps to must reflect the inherent nature of what it works upon, but the designer of the tool should always intend to make the tool a map more fit for human use.<p>Many of the things Gerrand cites were not created full form with the problems and uses clearly understood. This led to iteration and backwards compatibility, which introduced complications because now there were many ways to do things and not all suited for each other. I don't think his argument is that everything should be simple, but that the design should not feel iterative and piled upon. Instead it should reflect a consistency of vision for a problem and its solution.<p>If I may offer an example: In Haskell, the Prelude defines many types and functions which are imported into all modules (sort of similar to namespaces). Many of these functions have commonly understood names but only apply to certain data types. Within the extended set of libraries available in Haskell, there are many other implementations of these functions in terms of more general data types. The types represented are not simple, really, though they are limited and isolated in purpose.<p>Ideally, if one could go back and rewrite history, these more general functions and data types would be the ones exposed by the Prelude. Instead, the Prelude provides an earlier and less consistent view of common functions and datatypes, while the more consistent view is somewhat obscured inside of a number of neatly organized libraries.<p>Both the Prelude and the hierarchy of libraries seek to solve the solution of common tools for working with data and functions, but one has a more clear cut and comprehensible perspective while the other has an older, less consistent view.",1330333106

If you change the URL structure you break the links. If that's what you want then a version number in the URL makes sense, but in a properly RESTful API that's probably not what you want.<p>I think for a lot of people the reason they don't see the benefit of things from REST is they try to use them in isolation. You say ""this is useless for my RPC style API!"" and you are right.",1330333088

VisiCalc does not run on Vista and up as Microsoft dropped 16-bit compatibility.<p>Nonetheless, I agree with your general point that Microsoft puts a lot of effort in backward compatibility. But <i>so does Google with Android</i>! What makes you think the Android API breaks backward compatibility?<p>I have some (light) experience with Android development (Bluetooth app, basic UI, etc), across Android 1.6, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2, and I have for example never come across an API that broke backward compatibility. I often hear theoretical arguments like yours being made, but I have <i>never</i> been shown a concrete case, like ""they broke X in the new version Y of Android, so I had to do Z to workaround it"". In my experience, once an API call is stable and works in a given Android version, it never breaks in subsequent versions. I am sure there are some rare counter examples, but they are so isolated that they don't warrant all ""Android fragmentation is a problem"" articles I read around. These articles do <i>not</i> represent the opinion of the average Android developer like myself.",1330332817

3638262,comment,3637148,3637148,2,0,Tinned_Tuna,,,"I would argue that an ORM does get in the way in a good way. A decent ORM can do things such as extra full-text indexing behind the scenes (Thing Hibernate and Lucene) to provide a much better search over almost any database. You only have to tell it to do so (i.e. configuration) and it springs to life.<p>Similarly, if you decide that you don't like PostgreSQL and want to move to MySQL. You can go through your code and change all of your SQL to match the PostgreSQL dialect. Or (with Hibernate) you change one configuration parameter (the hbm2ddl one) to use the MySQL dialect as opposed to the PostgreSQL one.<p>Hibernate (I'm using Hibernate a lot, because it's the one I use at work, so I'm quite familiar with it) can also be configured to check the database schema at start,  update it to match your models, create a new schema or create a new schema and schedule it all to be dropped when your application terminates. This is useful, because your test configuration can be create-drop, and your live can be validate. When upgrading the live system, you can just redeploy with ""upgrade"" as the configuration.<p>In short, ORMs do have a lot of behind the scenes magic going on, but they can also offer developers a heck of a lot. Not to mention that they're thoroughly tried and tested bits of code. Hibernate even has the capacity to take on various transaction managers (Bitronix allows you to do one transaction over two databases, even if those databases are from different vendors).",1330332542

Counting these people in the GDP statistics skews the whole thing. Yet many of these people live just fine by farming, but do not need to use money, or use very little of it.

3638236,comment,3638014,3638014,10,0,krig,,,"I don't like this statement at all, sorry. It's a very anti-intellectual statement. Are any concepts that are difficult to grasp inherently worth less? That would make all of logic and math bad. Logic is not inherently easy for humans. We are a very emotional and irrational bunch.<p>I don't agree that technologies are bad just because they are difficult to master. The learning curve is utterly irrelevant to their inherent value. There are lots of things that are both incredibly difficult and amazingly valuable.<p>I also think this statement betrays an incredible short-sightedness. You are looking at the technology you know and think ""Wow! This is so simple! Why aren't those things I don't know this simple?"" Your technology appears simple to you primarily because it is yours. That's not a relativistic statement to imply that all technology is equally difficult to learn, it's just how our perspective shifts as we internalize new concepts.<p>To me, C++ is a lot simpler than Go. I've tried to grasp how to use things like interfaces and channels in Go, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. C++, on the other hand, has been my primary tool for over two decades. The things that appear unreasonably complex to you make sense to me because I am familiar with the reasons they are there. Does that mean that Go is difficult and C++ is simple? Of course not. To someone who doesn't know a thing about programming, they are both absolutely arcane. Even the concept of variables is fundamentally difficult for people to grasp. It's an entirely abstract concept, and abstraction is not easy.<p>A better measure for the utility of the technology would be to ask how well it solves the problems it is intended for. Empirically, it would seem that C and C++ are both the best tools available for different sets of problems. Go is new, but I don't see it being adopted anywhere outside Google yet. I've looked at it, and while it has some attractive traits, it is fundamentally shaped by a different set of priorities than my own. I just don't find the problems it claims to solve all that problematic.",1330331718

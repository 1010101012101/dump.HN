It's just a number... unless there's more to it than ""I like 90 more than 60,"" it's lacking any kind of reason or direction, which might explain why he's having such a hard time figuring out how to attain it.  A goal that you'll be able to reach comes from a need or desire you can feel and likely articulate.<p>As for the rest...

In fact, it's remarkably effective at preventing scammers from draining people's accounts, as long as you're not stupid enough to take a photo of your card and post it online (yeah, people do that). That little card is what prevents the whole ActiveX fiasco from crumbling down like a house of cards, precisely because it's so low-tech (i.e. requires physical access).<p>A lot of the other crap is understandable when you take into account the fact that online banking was first introduced to Korea in the mid-1990s. HTTPS was useless at the time because of U.S. export restrictions limiting it to 40 bits. Home-brewed ActiveX controls were used to implement 128-bit encryption. Korea also decided to use public keys and X.509 client certificates to identify people, way ahead of the rest of the world, but of course no browser supported them so someone had to write custom software. After that, inertia and regulatory capture allowed what was supposed to be a stopgap measure to continue for another 15+ years, long after proper HTTPS became available in every browser.<p>The only benefit I can think of is that Koreans don't have to worry about those stupid password restrictions that a lot of American banks impose on their customers :)",1365645464

Replace ""Euros/Yens"" with ""gold"" in my sentence, and my point stands with gold being backed by <i>nothing</i>. Basically the US government is totally fine with side markets that they cannot control directly and that exist in parallel with the USD (whether it is EUR, gold, Bitcoin, whatever).<p>Your other argument also fails to convince me that the government would want to declare Bitcoin illegal. You say it can be used for money laundering, but gold and cash can already be used for money laundering (and even more discreetly since trading gold or cash does not leave a trail like in the Bitcoin blockchain). The US govt does not make gold and cash illegal because they realize it is silly/unenforcable/pointless and would hurt the economy more than it would manage reducing illegal activity. Case in point: the US did attempt to criminalize possession of gold in 1933, but they eventually realized how silly and stupid this was, so they decriminalized it!<p>When the Internet was being developed throughout the world, were you the kind of person who looked at it and envisioned that its censorship-resistant decentralized aspect could be used to facilitate the transmission of potentially illegal information (software, data, child porn, ideas, etc, especially in countries with no freedom of speech) and said ""geesh I bet governments are going to make Internet illegal""?<p><i>""For one, the government doesn't care for 'startups springing up everywhere'""</i><p>I think my point was clear that these startups are potentially the start of a big new economy complementing the current one that could financially benefit the government with revenues from taxes. So, yes, the government would love to see a big economy pop up.<p><i>""Plus, if bitcoin is banned, its economic activity will just migrate to conventional money again, it wont be lost.""</i><p>No. The world economy is not a zero-sum game. It is possible to <i>create</i> wealth (wealth is stuff we want, not money, see <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a> ) and Bitcoin and its economy would certainly create extra wealth. Another example showing how silly your assumption that the economy is a zero-sum game is: since the start of e-commerce, do you think that it has <i>stolen</i> commerce from or mostly <i>added</i> to the brick-and-mortar industry? Obviously, sometimes stolen (journals, etc) but e-commerce has mostly added wealth and economic activity on top of the brick-and-mortar one. In other word the size and richness and wealth of the current economy far surpases the one of the economy pre-Internet.",1365645402

Today this is solved by medallions, imperfectly, but tomorrow this can be solved by technology.<p>What can't be solved by technology is the number of cabs trolling around.  You can have perfect GPS based dispatch, with your next fare always ready to get in your cab just as you're dropping off the last fare, and there would still be huge problems, because there's nothing to stop this ideal set of 100% in-use cabs from being diluted into five times as many 20% in use cabs.  People will take the closest cab and drivers will drive around to make sure they're the closest cab.<p>You can charge a per-mile tax on empty taxis, but that just raises cab fares for citizens (or forces caps) for no good reason.

If we have to adopt ourselves and our society to it, instead of adapting it to our preferences, goals and morals, then it's not a tool, it's a ruler.<p>In this case, cryptography might be a solution.

Second it breaks lots of workflows and conveniences (e.g full text search of emails).<p>Second, I don't want the government, Google, or anybody else to have it be legal to look into my email if they can break the cryptography or find the key.

The second you stop having money is the second you are on the street without anything.  So money is <i>something</i>.<p>You can go through and live in a decent house with a decent car and you'll be happy if you make yourself happy but I just don't see how people can argue that money doesn't make you happy or happier.  I get that in and of itself if you fuck yourself over and you don't keep your friends or family or kids and you work so much that you will be unhappy even with money, but money can make you happier even if its indirectly.  You may be one to sit at home and do nothing on the weekends and I get that, but having money allows you to go out and experience things.  It buys experiences that you normally couldn't have.<p>Having no money does limit what you can do in life.  The case can be made that you are happier not doing things but I think if you are the least bit adventurous money can buy you pleasure, joy, experiences shared with loved ones, and in the indirect result happiness.  I believe family and friends are more important, but saying money should't be a goal is just silly in my opinion.  Why not have both as the girl on the taco shell commercial would say?<p>With no money there is a slew of problems that come your way..late rent, bills, struggling to always be on top, etc.  With a lot of money I'm sure there are issues as well..but I'm pretty positive you can't find anyone that has a lot of money that has good relationships that would trade their large bank account to gain more happiness and be more free.  If it's not your personal goal then that's your decision and your life.<p>I'm NOT saying that chasing money should be your only goal.  Working crazy hours in a field you don't like while ruining relationships is not healthy and isn't good.  But strategically gaining money by working hard and smart and taking risk isn't such a bad thing.  I'm a big believer in doing what you love and being the best at it and getting money that way, I'm not a fan of getting a degree in a field and working your life in that field just because of the money.<p>Happiness starts with you and ends with you.  Whatever you surround yourself with should be things that make you happy.  It's also not relative.  Having more money shouldn't just make you automatically happier, but it should cut out some stress to let you be free to be happier and enable you to do more things that make you happy.<p>/rant",1365644742

It's also possible that Keynesianism makes a substantial bet on the possibilities of human technological progress which can be stated as the following:<p>If our economy moves forward at a quick enough pace we can engineer our way out of the most serious problems that arise along the way (due to physical constraints such as resource limitations, environmental degradation, etc).<p>Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.<p>An example of this might be your example of  carbon emissions. The economy might solve it thusly: As soon as clean energy sources such as solar and wind reach such a price that it does not make fiscal sense not to have them, they will proliferate as fast as we can build them. Worldwide carbon emissions will take a nose dive and the problem of global warming may reverse or at the very least stall.<p>We might get ourselves to this price point faster by employing Keynesian policies of government spending as China has - i.e., providing government funded subsidies to push the price artificially down.<p>If this happens, then we will have bought ourselves time to deal with the next set of potentially lethal problems that arise due to our economic growth.<p>(Your links touch on this but I do not agree that our economy will keep going full steam ahead until collapsing due to insufficient energy supplies.

Very often you get the traditional notation above the tabs, then you have all you need. Most guitar training nowadays is very non-classical, the summit of that modern learning route is being able to improvise freely. You are actively being trained to LISTEN and pick it up that way, you pick up chord changes, rhythm and melody, even the key, just by listening and then repeat them or improvise over what is there. You end up applying quite a lot of theory but most guitar players don't study 100% dry theory but are taught to use certain patterns or to use their instrument to find out certain correlations others are learning by heart. It is more about expression.<p>In contrast, the highest point you can reach in typical classical training is being able to perfectly sight-read and reproduce the music exactly as it is on the sheet, hence the very clear and detailed instructions. The focus lies on re-production and precision.<p>A Jazz guitarist's lead sheet can be as short as half a page and he could still play for hours.<p>Both ways have their merits and disadvantages, this notation actually helps neither. It is still way too complicated for the average tab user - while the proficient classical player is missing vital information.<p>On top of that I find it EXTREMELY hard to read, the difference between the circle being filled on the side or on top is practically indistinguishable when you are a little further back, so are the tiny little lines sticking out of circles pointing up or down.",1365644235

It doesn't have any government to back it, and it has properties that make it not very likable to any large government.<p>Banning bitcoin wont be like banning Euro or the Yen, which are legitimate, sovereign national currencies.<p>It would be like banning or freezing assets in off-shore accounts (which governments have been known to do). Or like banning the private buying of gold (which the US had done, from 1933 to mid-seventies:<p><i>""Executive Order 6102 is an Executive Order signed on April 5, 1933, by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates within the continental United States"". The order criminalized the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.""</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a><p>Private / alternative currencies have been banned in several cases all over the world. One example from Wikipedia:<p><i>In Australia, the Bank Notes Tax Act of 1910 practically shut down the circulation of private currencies by imposing a prohibitive tax on the practice. It was later repealed and a fine imposed for private currencies (Commonwealth Bank Act 1945). Many other nations have similar such policies to eliminate private sector competition.</i><p>Or:<p><i>The co-operative society Jord Arbejde Kapital was founded in Denmark during the Great Depression in 1931. The society issued a popular local currency which was subsequently outlawed by the Danish government in 1933.</i><p>Not to mention that the whole idea that the US doesn't care at all about Yen and Euros is flawed BS. The US would very much like to keep the dollar unthreatened as the ""golden world standard"". But those currencies belong to very large economies and countries for the US to be able to do anything about it. Not to mention that the Yen is tied to the dollar in intricate ways nowadays (Chinese own trillions of it).<p>Still, when any third world or developing country expresses a desire to do business in Euros (something that happened oftentimes before the Euro crisis), the US exerts as much political and diplomatic pressure as it can to have them revert course.<p>So, using the fact that the US does not ban the Yen and the Euro as an ""argument"" why it cannot ban bitcoin? Really, not the very best in informed thinking. To call one ""paranoid"" about arguing the possibility of the bitcoin ban? Even worse (and rude to top).<p>You might as well say that since the US hasn't entered a war with China or EU, it will never enter a war with a terrorist group operating outside any government. Seeing that China and EU are huge countries/unions, whereas the Bitcoin community is just an ad-hoc random assembly of people investing on an alternative monetary system.",1365644124

Do you still think you have an reasonable expectation of privacy?<p>The problem with your argument is that it is based on the idea that if people <i>want</i> privacy, they are entitled to it <i>even if they do nothing to protect that privacy</i>.  There is nothing wrong with expecting people to be a bit proactive when it comes to their privacy -- closing doors, drawing their curtains, encrypting their email.  People should not just shrug about someone filming them on the toilet, they should do something to prevent it (and if a person started to drill holes in the door, sure, prosecute them -- for destroying someone's property).<p>""If someone were going into a restroom taking pictures, people would feel rightfully violated""<p>No, if someone were going into a restroom <i>taking pictures of other people going to the bathroom in a closed stall</i> they would rightly feel violated.  Any weaker standard is basically saying that nobody can take pictures in public, because they might accidentally catch a person peeing on a wall and thus violate their privacy.<p>""The ease with which it can be done is irrelevant to the legality of it.""<p>No, it is very relevant to the legality, because when we make easy and popular things illegal we worsen an already out-of-control criminal justice system.  We do not want to start arresting people just because they are using their cameras, even if their cameras are mounted on their heads, even if they wear their head-mounted cameras into bathrooms.  If cameras are everywhere and used by everyone, the answer is to build bathroom stalls that go from the floor to the ceiling, not to open the door to waves of prosecution (which will almost certainly be used selectively against ""undesirable"" people).<p>The appropriate place to draw the legal line with privacy is with people taking proactive and reasonable measures to be private.  Putting letters in envelopes, closing curtains, closing doors, and yes, encrypting emails.  You have no expectation of privacy in public parks, nor if your door is left open, nor if your curtains are left open, so why should you expect privacy when you send unencrypted email?",1365644084

Certainly not by force, and almost never by doing an end-run around the CEO to the Board of Directors, except in the case of fraud/violations of corporate policy - which I don't really consider a Mutiny, but more of a reporting of violations to the Board of Directors, in which the Board makes a decision.<p>I agree with the parent - It really is very, very rare (still trying to think of an example) in which anything more than a departmental mutiny takes place.  The CEO's job is usually quite secure (until the Board decides otherwise) - it is much more often the case that those individuals simply leave and go form their own venture (The traitorous eight)",1365642705

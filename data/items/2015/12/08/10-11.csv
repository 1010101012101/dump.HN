10695721,comment,10689499,10689499,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"Discussion of conditions with certain attributes always seems to be a can of worms.  By <i>attributes</i> I mean characteristics such as highly variable or difficult to describe symptoms, association with anxiety, depression, pain and other &quot;subjective&quot; states, and where the patient&#x27;s state crosses over poorly defined boundaries of &quot;mental&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; domains.<p>As commented by tudorw, an issue is &quot;mind-body dualism&quot;, a philosophy often associated with Descartes.  Dualistic belief is not exactly delusional, but certainly it&#x27;s not in accord with contemporary scientific work.  The problem stems from our modern materialistic disregard for the immaterial mind vs. esteeming the tangible body.  Dualism remains a principle source of stigma against acceptance of conditions involving difficulties integrating emotion, thought and action.<p>Adopting a scientific approach is assuredly optimum for health professionals, but given dualism is the predominant view in Western societies, the prescription to replace dualism with monism gets little uptake.  The problem as it exists among physicians only mirrors the broader culture, it must change in both subsets to have any effect at all.<p>As I recall the myth of &quot;objective reality&quot; has been discussed many times on HN. &quot;Embracing the scientific method&quot; is more problem than solution in this context.  That is, equating science with a distorted version of objectivity is a basis for the trouble dealing with FM, et. al., in the first place.<p>In a way, exposure to the class of illnesses like FM evokes responses somewhat like we&#x27;d expect on first hearing about quantum physics.  It&#x27;s confusing to people, it doesn&#x27;t compute, doesn&#x27;t make sense, doesn&#x27;t follow the rules we are used to.  Mind == body?  Wait a second, you mean there literally is no <i>mind</i>?  When we&#x27;re ready for that, then and only then will we begin to make progress.",1449572125

I think he’s just misremembered, as this has never been the case. Until the last few years or so, when the SF novels started to achieve something approaching parity in sales, the mainstream always out-sold the SF – on average, if my memory isn’t letting me down, by a ratio of about three or four to one. I think a lot of people have assumed that the SF was the trashy but high-selling stuff I had to churn out in order to keep a roof over my head while I wrote the important, serious, non-genre literary novels. Never been the case, and I can’t imagine that I’d have lied about this sort of thing, least of all as some sort of joke. The SF novels have always mattered deeply to me – the Culture series in particular – and while it might not be what people want to hear (academics especially), the mainstream subsidised the SF, not the other way round.

I&#x27;m envisioning a future where email is a web application framework, so that the internet as a network of machines becomes a background detail, and application development happens at a higher level--on a protocol for a network of people. For example, if you&#x27;re a developer and you want to be able to do something in your email conversations that you can&#x27;t already do, you could write a plugin that performs that task (assuming you couldn&#x27;t find a pre-existing plugin that did what you want), and then you could use it with everyone that you can communicate with via email because it would be directly integrated into your conversations. No server-side coding would be necessary, and you wouldn&#x27;t have to bother with getting people to use your application because it would already be in a convenient place for them.<p>Coming back to your question: I see the potential use cases for this as <i>primarily</i> a superset of the current use cases for email. For bulk mailing and automated notifications, SMTP remains superior by nature of its simplicity (mostly... though this application edits self-generated notification messages to append notifications when there are multiple in a short time period). Email clients for personal use tend to have an immense number of bells and whistles, but if you assume that those will inevitably creep into this application as well over time, it should eventually be wholly practical for personal email.<p>Business emailing needs can be significantly more specialized, but they&#x27;re also more likely to want advanced capabilities from their communication software. Assuming that some additional plugins offering desirable features are created, this could be very useful in a business setting.<p>I&#x27;ve added some gifs to the README that show editing, adding an inline reply, and adding a plugin. I know the flow to add a plugin is pretty gnarly at this point. I&#x27;m planning to pull them more directly into message content in the near future, because I tend to forget they&#x27;re there when I have to click a button to even see that area. :)",1449569904

By convention, you leave address 0x0 empty, since dereferencing the NULL pointer is bad form :) At address 0x4 you have a int containing the target temperature.

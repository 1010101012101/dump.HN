4480534,comment,4479671,4479671,1,0,hexagonc,,,"I'm not sure what's new here.  All the Windows Phones (7+) had a unique user interface.  The array of live tiles, the emphasis on a narrow array of primary colors and the lack of UI customization always characterized Windows Phones.  Also, Nokia phones have been known for good build quality for quite a while.  Producing phones in colors other than black and white isn't new either.<p>Considering the limitations that Microsoft imposes on customizing the OS, I'm not sure how many avenues for differentiation remain for the phone body itself.  There is only so much you can do with pure design.  I think the more radical and original designs are only enabled by superior core technology like the size of the SOCs, batteries and other internal components.  If you want a smartphone as thin and flexible as a credit card, then you're going to need advancements on a whole lot of fronts, most of which aren't within the purview of the designers.  I think that Nokia needs to bank on something more than just phones that are outwardly a bit fancier than the competition.  4.7 inch screens and Gorilla Glass are old news.",1346867923

But I am not agree with you in the sense that an statistic approach is not possible. There are so many opportunities but the reality is that game designers don't want that to happen.<p>The main problem I have found in this regard is the fact that designers love to have control over the behaviour of the game, and I believe they don't even want to understand how a machine learning AI can be possible. I even discussed my master thesis (an SVM based controller for enemies) with a veteran RTS game designer and his response was very heart breaking, he just told me that Game AI was good enough and that ""people"" wouldn't care about a better AI (after that he just turned out and walked away)<p>I am still optimist that eventually that would happen.

It's pretty clear what's in Romney's returns at this point (a lower than average income tax rate, though it's hard to say whether it's closer to 5% or 15%), so I don't see a huge downside risk for him in them being released. If they upped their demands to, say $10 million, we're talking about real money, even for Mitt. Enough to get an extra percent of the vote or so in a moderate sized state. Unless there's something genuinely illegal in the returns, a couple days of renewed interest in them might be preferable to giving up a bit of money at the margin (though, paid media is fairly well saturated now, so it might not be that useful).<p>From Romney's point of view, too, there'd be no guarantee that paying 10 million would prevent them from being released.

If so that number should be reduced down to about the ~5000 apps that are actually worth a crap in Android in which case Windows phone would probably stack up pretty well.<p>- It can't be moentization, just yesterday most of read of the heartbreaking case of Retickr (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4475918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4475918</a>), after a year of nearing the top of the app store for iPhone (which is assumed to be a more profitable demographic) they still shut down after burning through (some/all?) founder savings, plus a seed round plus a funding round.

But it ""converted"" me for a few reasons:<p>- The screen size.  I write iOS apps at work and get annoying having to use that tiny screen.  I had hopes the iPhone5 would address this.  Making the screen a little taller is a weak answer.<p>- More customizability.  The Verge had a thread recently where they asked you to show off your phone/tablet home screen.  It was a stark contrast to see the way android users personalized their home screens vs. the same grid of icons the iOS users posted.  The widgets I have on my home screen tell me all kinds of things without having to run any apps.<p>- More control.  I can run whatever app I want on it, and I can sell my apps to other android users however I want with my own billing methods if need be.  Selling Android apps is  easier than dealing with the iOS App Store.<p>I (obviously anecdotally) think the scales have tipped.  I'm running into more people loving their Android phones instead of tolerating them.  The latest fad apps have launched with Android counterparts (Draw Something, SongPop). When we show our software to potential clients running on a SGSIII and an iPhone4s, they all want to touch the SGSIII phone and play with it.  Side by side with the screens turned on, there's no comparison.<p>It's a fun ""fight"" to watch, and we're benefitting from it.",1346866450

I even didn't believe the leak at first because I thought it was a clear step backward for Apple.<p>The Lumia's have a few things going for them: A really sturdy unibody shell that's much more scratch/dent resistant than the Androids I had before, without the shatteriness of the iPhone 4 back (and minor scratches don't hurt the color, it's not just a surface finish). The curve is much more pleasant in hand than the iPhone or most other Androids I've tried. The back of the case is extremely clean, without the logos or fine print of an iPhone. And the 800 and apparently 920 have a curved glass front which is really slick (I hate that the 900 missed out on this).<p>The press-to-focus/press-all-the-way-to-shoot dedicated camera button is really really nice too.<p>The side-center sleep/power button location is also a nice subtle touch. Pick it up with my right hand, and it's right under my thumb. Pick it up with my left hand and its right under my middle finger. Easy to press to turn the screen on or off. I didn't think it would matter (and it looked weird at first) but it really is nicer than reaching up to the top of the device to shut off/lock the screen on my old Evo.<p>But in a world where well over half the people I know with iPhones have them in bulky or just plain ugly cases... how much does hardware design really matter? Everyone has an iPhone like everyone else, and then they put it in a usually-boring case.

The element being added may be one from the head so it's best to work out where it goes first and then pick the extension direction that requires the fewest number of elements to be shuffled up. Also the shuffling can be done in bulk using memmove() (can't use memcpy since the areas of memory will overlap when shuffling up by more than one position); this should also be faster than doing them one at a time.<p>Anyway, i'm off on holiday so I've got about another 15 minutes to look at this so I'm not going to get far.

There is a lot of info, a graph I dont get and a list of seemingly unconnected events with no exposition.<p>2.  It took a couple of plays to work it out - its really about the categories you have set up.  Clicking the filter gives you a good sense of what the person has behind them\nNow I get it, I like it.<p>3. So that leads me to: If I am a non-speaking, non-hackathoning (Whats a hackathon) uncharitable, non conference goer - my statuschart will look pretty thin.  \nCan I alter the categories to suit me?  At worst just change the labels<p>4. I definitely want to expand the 'projects' section - I would want to do F/OSS, Salaried jobs, contract work, education etc.<p>5. pricing - I think it was on the PR piece you got - $5 a month and 30/year.  That sounds good but why make people sign up before they can follow / read a page.  If I wanted to give this to a propspective employer, I would be forcing them to sign in before seeing my CV - or have I missed something<p>6. Instead of category @all@, which is just a big long list of confusing, can I suggest <i>top</i> - where i can weight each event and then there is a simplish algorithm to float the events I weighted highest to top (perhaps weight / days since).  That way there is a default page open that has my best stuff listed right at the top, and only then does someone have to filter out.<p>7. I am thinking of this as a CV - I would want to put a small paragraph onto some events to explain them, maybe in a popup.<p>Otherwise really good - there is a rash of github resumes and other 'show off my stuff' sites.  Its going to be an interesting area - good luck iterating.<p>cheers<p>Edit: kicked off a bit strong, toned it down a littel",1346864909

I'm disappointed in the response, and disappointed in the demand rapidly outpacing the supply. I understand the engineers do what the engineers do, but other complaints about RPi hold as well: they're not good at communication, they're only really transparent on spotty occurrences, and it's been six months since they launched and they're still having a hard time producing the units being demanded. What I was hoping for from this new revision was a chip that wasn't sold out. The email notifying me of the delay said their CPU was sold out so new boards could not be made. Shame on RS for telling me I had a unit coming to me when that unit apparently hadn't actually been produced yet.<p>As for the other distributors, some people apparently got great service from RS as well. My frustration is with the entire operation, top to bottom. It's hard to call this a success, and there's no indication it's going to get better. I have to wonder how they're going to supply the educational market if this is how they handle the hacker market they need so badly.<p>I know this sounds like a hit-job on my part, but you have to realize this is incredibly frustrating, and the news I'm hearing from people who received them is that the users aren't really interested in units to begin with (see below, ""I never turned mine on"").",1346864895

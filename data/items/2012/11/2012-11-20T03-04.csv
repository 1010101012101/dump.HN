Why I said <i>misleading</i> was not primarily because I thought or maybe assumed (as I am no legal expert myself) but because the way you made a sweeping statement which might have been either done knowingly or merely in the flow of writing that comment you included the line. Incorrect because it was actually incorrect and when I wrote the comment I didn't have Set Theory in mind.<p>I just wanted to clarify the scenarios where laws are intertwined with religion, tribes or caste. Regarding the last term <i>caste</i> I have not been able to find any instance but have read in articles that there are such provisions.<p>I would like to add that your mention of <i>Polygamy in India</i> needs few lines - it's not enforced in India until and unless you are someone famous where people take interest out of the celebrity nature and hence state intervenes or the case/issue has blown up. It's present even in religions other than Islam. It's 'sort of' legal in most of the tribes based on <i>tradition</i> (this term often comes up in all sorts of legal cases in this country and is given importance) and it's common in rural areas.",1353383867

4807663,comment,4804081,4804457,1,0,dkrich,,,"My point is that the title suggests that the content of the article explains how to build a business as a solo founder. So I would expect that it talks about things you should do to get your business going overcoming challenges, etc. that are unique to a solo business owner. Just going on about why a team is important and how to build it seems almost the opposite of what the title suggests.<p>Conventional wisdom is that you have to have cofounders. I was interested in reading an article describing running a business solo. This article did not do that. It basically reads: Don't have cofounders? That's okay, you can hire them. But whatever you do you shouldn't try to run a business by yourself.<p>That does not explain how to start a business as a solo cofounder. It's basically like writing an article with the title ""You can read with terrible vision"" and then writing an article about why you shouldn't try to read without getting glasses to improve your terrible vision first.",1353383705

4807645,comment,4806894,4807380,1,0,ohashi,,,"My first web hosting company ran away with my domain and I never got it back until it expired [0]. They ran away with 40,000 customers' domains. I had to learn how domains expired and catch it. I am thankful I guess, because I got involved with domain catching and made a fair bit of money from buying expired domains. But I don't wish those months of downtime and uncertainty on anyone because the hosting company went under or did something malicious. That isn't to say that registrars are immune either (RegisterFly is an example). But at least that is only 1 layer in many cases, you and the registrar. In that example, ICANN intervened and GoDaddy took over their accounts if I recall correctly. Many web hosting companies have reseller agreements, so you are stuck in between the hosting company and registrar. That can complicate things. Some even put domains in their own name rather than yours.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.carrierhotels.com/wiredspace/archives/000148.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carrierhotels.com/wiredspace/archives/000148.html</a>",1353383217

Toyota's employees still enjoy lifetime employment, but most of the manufacturing needed to make a car gets done by Toyota subsidiaries or subcontractors. These employ people on a contract basis, and they can stop renewing the contracts at any time. E.g. while Toyota was bragging about not laying off employees, their subcontractors were slashing jobs.

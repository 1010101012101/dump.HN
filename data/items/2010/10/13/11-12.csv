The tracker doesn't do a lot computation. It's mostly I/O, isn't it?<p>Another interesting choice would be node.js. A framework that seems to be optimized for that kind of architecture.  \nA bit of caching and a scalable backend (e.g. Riak) would be a nice combination...",1286971142

That's the type of meta programming that made Rails so popular and productive (and slow) for some cases.

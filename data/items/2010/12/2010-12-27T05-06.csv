Imagine if there were no property rights and you could appropriate anyone's property for your own use.  Then there would be no motivation to produce, because the fruits of your labor could be taken by anyone else.  What you did produce- you would be inclined to consume what you produced as soon as you produced it...

I more often than not have enough for myself, and any dependents, however I find myself stealing from X, (X = shops, mom and pop store, chain stores, offices, friends' houses). The things that I pick up are more often than not objects that catch my fancy for a while, and sometimes it is just to feed the rush to steal something. I understand that it is not socially accepted behavior, and there are various religious/moral arguments against this. I got suspended from my high school for something similar, and went in for counseling. I have been diagnosed with Kleptomania, and talked with the lady more about it, but she wasn't able to give a definitive answer about why it was wrong, beyond the fact that it wasn't accepted by society and some other obscure reasons.<p>I tried looking up stuff on the internet, and well it wasn't really clear to me.

So given that a 486 was about a million transistors, and a modern Nehalem has about a billion, you could probably make a chip with a thousand 486s on it today.<p>A clock frequency of 10 GHz is crazy talk, on the other hand. It would use way too much power. The power dissipation of a circuit is something like<p><pre><code>    P = C * V^2 * f
</code></pre>
where C is the capacitance, V is the voltage, and f is the clock frequency.

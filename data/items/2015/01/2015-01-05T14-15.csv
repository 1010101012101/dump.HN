The application[0] was in the store for 11 months, I then updated for Material Design/Lolipop and puff, app suspended.<p>I&#x27;m using the TMDb.org API for displaying actor and movie images which--in my understanding--is allowed if I attribute TMDb as the source. I did that in the settings/copyright section. There are also a bunch of other apps that use the same API yet they are still in the Play Store. I didn&#x27;t make a single dime off of it and spent roughly 250h on it with all the fine tuning and third party integrations.<p>I responded and asked what exactly the issue is and got another generic response.

If it&#x27;s radar evading abilities aren&#x27;t that great with a combat loadout I have to wonder if the expense of designing the F-35 to be low observable will be worth it.<p>Because, as you said, if AA missiles are becoming so advanced that dogfighting really is dead, having a quasi-stealth aircraft may not be the advantage that it was originally billed to be.<p>Crazily enough, the program is having problems with heat melting off the stealth coatings, which is why the current fleet is not cleared for supersonic flight.

So it makes sense to use the two different technologies together.<p>Second, notice that the connection is peer to peer - no video data passes through your server, which saves you bandwidth and cpu cycles.  This is the coolest thing about WebRTC.  Even though you have to maintain websocket (or long polling, etc) connections on your server for each user, none of the data transmitted between peers will cost you anything.<p>In short - WebRTC is good for somethings, other things will be fine using only websocket.",1420469742

If your select query contains a tables primary keys, then the results from a query can be edited inline. Example if you run SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id IN (1,2,3)   then you can actually edit the results directly without needing to switch back to the data view.<p>3. If you have a trigger or view that depends on a specific column or table, and the column/table gets renamed, SQLite Professional will prompt you with the details and alter the underlying trigger/views to be updated with the new proper information.<p>4. SQLite Professional will automatically reload if your database is modified by an external app (such a directly via a sqlite3 prompt, a php script, etc).<p>That said, Base is a great app. If you already own a copy of it and the above functionality does not interest you, I would probably just suggest keeping with it.",1420469714

8839030,comment,8838712,8838712,0,0,exDM69,,,"Now this is very interesting!<p>There are plenty of compiler writing tutorials for conservative, imperative programming languages with a straightforward static type system (like C).<p>I did study a little bit of compilers for functional languages from Simon Peyton-Jones&#x27; old book &quot;The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages&quot; [0]. It predates the Haskell programming language and uses a contemporary research language called Miranda as the target as well as the &quot;host&quot; language.<p>... which brings me to another topic: Monads. The SPJ book has a few chapters on implementing a Hindley-Milner -style type inference algorithm. It&#x27;s written in Miranda without any Monads and uses a clever trick for coming up with unique temporary type names. There&#x27;s an infinite list of integers [0..], which is &quot;split&quot; when traversing the syntax tree so that the left branch of the recursion tree gets the even numbers and the right branch gets the odd numbers.<p>The method works fine and is indeed very clever but try comparing that code to the same algorithm re-implemented (by me) with Monads (State and Error monads + transformer) [1]. The original algorithm is rather long and hard to follow (because lists of unique integers are passed to all functions).<p>I had a blast writing this algorithm, and I wanted to share it. It&#x27;s been a few years since I last worked with it. It was my first non-trivial use of monads and I really like how it turned out in the end.<p>[0] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>

An Iterator can be a Monad if you provide a flatMap / bind implementation with the right behavior and lo and behold, this operation doesn&#x27;t care about how the items are produced (synchronously or asynchronously or in what order). In OOP terms, you could have Iterator be a subtype of Monad, with the Monad being the more generic interface.<p>So it&#x27;s hard to explain because it is very generic, can be applied to many things and everybody has an aha! moment once they spot the resemblance in the various monad implementations, hence the urge to write a blog post.",1420468645

At some point the ROI curve stops making sense.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s not pure business though - people in the media live off their creativity and seeing people pirate your stuff can be emotionally difficult. I would not be surprised if some places over-invest in DRM because they feel a moral and emotional imperative to defend their work from piracy as much as they can.<p>BluRay DRM is probably as good as you can technically get for movies distributed on discs. For movies distributed via the internet it&#x27;s easier. But the economics of DRM are tricky - the key thing that hurt BluRay DRM (and the designers were fully aware of this problem) is that movie producers have a strong financial incentive to push player prices low, and player manufacturers have a strong financial incentive to push movie prices low. Movies and players are &quot;compliments&quot; of each other in the economics jargon. Not surprisingly, player makers make the absolute minimal effort when it comes to DRM and that&#x27;s one reason why cracks keep happening.<p>One of the most obvious tension points here is PC software players. They&#x27;re much harder to defend. But they increase the size of the player market (and therefore the movie market) a lot. So movie studios ended up deciding to allow them, despite knowing it&#x27;d weaken the DRM.<p>BD+ was designed to try and resolve this problem by allowing movie producers to spend the money on copy protection rather than player manufacturers, and it was remarkably effective for a long time. BD+ ended the era of open source players for good, only full time reversing teams that are willing to keep up continual effort on a disk-by-disk basis can break it. But in the end it wasn&#x27;t enough for a fully convincing solution.",1420467772

8838834,comment,8838362,8838362,0,0,VanL,,,"(Disclosure: IAAPL, but this is my view and isn&#x27;t reflective of any former clients or my current employer.)<p>The key problem with the patent system is the problem of <i>disclosure.</i> We always say that the patent system is a bargain between the inventor and the public. The public gets new knowledge and the inventor gets a period of exclusivity for the using/making etc that knowledge.<p>Where the system falls down is in the &quot;disclosure to the public&quot; part of that bargain. Patent language has become so abstracted that most of the time it fails to inform someone of skill in the art how to actually make the promised item. This has some corollary effects:<p>- The patent system becomes less useful as a source for knowledge (as argued by the article)
- Novelty and obviousness (and later, infringement) all become less certain. This results in poor quality patents coming out of the patent office and high costs to litigate for infringement.<p>In the end, though, the result is that the patent system is (for most of the computer arts where I spend my time) not very useful as a store of knowledge. If there is a choice, I will almost always seek out a paper (or source code) rather than an accompanying patent to get an understanding of new technology.<p>This is due to the incentives associated with each type of publication. The source code is designed to convey certain algorithms to the computer in an unambiguous way. Papers are designed to get read and cited - and they don&#x27;t do that unless they communicate what is new and meaningful to an audience of peers.<p>In contrast, patents are designed to cover a range of possible solution spaces, with as much room for reinterpretation later as is possible without being insoluably ambiguous.<p>This problem is hard to undo because the push to abstract the descriptions in patents was done with the best of intentions. 
- Congress wanted to allow new things to be described without constricting the form of the language used. 
- Prosecuting lawyers (and their clients) wanted to get the maximum coverage for their new ideas. 
- Courts want to reward inventors and disallow trivial workarounds (nail->screw) not addressing the core inventive concept.<p>All of these points are valid ones - but in combination, the result is that patents have become too vague, particularly in anything computer-related.<p>As an aside, the mechanical arts (and some others, such as many bio/chem arts) don&#x27;t suffer from this problem to nearly the same extent, and so you usually don&#x27;t see the same problems.",1420467280

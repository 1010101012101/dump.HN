409909,comment,409467,409467,0,0,pmarsh,,,"Hurt my lower back coding years ago on a wooden chair so here are my tips.<p>- Eat healthy, plenty of greens and veggies and as little sugar as possible. If you're young get in this habit and you won't need to break it when you're old (late 20's being old)<p>- Switch up coffee and caffeinated beverages for green tea.<p>- Get up and move around often during the day. Might hurt the end LOC numbers but being away from a problem can help you come up with a solution. Plus it gets you away from your desk and be social for a bit.<p>- Exercise. Seriously. I don't care what your deadline is, you can put aside 60 minutes to run/walk/shower. If you can't, then go for a longer walk and find a more realistic goal/job. You'll gain health and be able to stay awake longer without aides.<p>Nothing is more important than your body. Take care of it you only get one.",1230260163

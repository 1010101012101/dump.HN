779174,comment,779108,779108,0,0,sfwc,,,"I think ""Factor"" is a good name for a programming language, it's memorable and it conjures up appropriate mental images. That the word has both of these qualities ensures that it will be used for many other things, and this will be true of most good names. Instead of worrying about the googlability of ""Factor"", can't we count on people to at least search for ""Factor programming language""? And if Google isn't already returning good enough results for that now, I think I'd rather wait a little while for search technology to catch up than compromise on the names of my programming languages.",1250931563

Do they just have a load of links to news aggregated articles with comments from anyone they can grab around their office, and a lot of empty space on the site? Genuine question - how does it work? How do they drive their traffic in there?",1250931339

His argument applies much more to gotos that can jump across procedure boudaries. Most surviving gotos (including the PHP goto) are not that unconstrained so they do represent a compromise between Dijkstra's position and the pragmatic use of goto where it actually improves the readability of code - especially when exceptions are not available for some reason.",1250931066

People have tried, over many years, and the results - as we just saw - seem to be all round mediocre. In my view the main reason we have not ""solved"" this domain (as we've solved operating systems, databases, file systems, word processors, spreadsheets, email, data representation, etc.) are that the problem has been too arcane to interest enough engineers.</i><p>I believe every statement in that paragraph to be incorrect.",1250931039

For example Python (in the cPython version).<p>And there's a continuum between interpretation and compilation.

779161,comment,778593,779008,0,0,gruseom,,,"You're assuming your conclusion: that the languages are equivalent in power and differ only in syntax. If that were true, then sure, one would simply make an arbitrary choice based on taste. But it isn't true. It's profoundly untrue.<p>The syntax in that first example you quote isn't arbitrary. It's essentially the only notation that exists for representing the structure of a program explicitly in language. Is that valuable? Uh, yeah. It's incredibly valuable. It's worth a lot more than syntax in many cases.<p>By contrast, the syntax in the second example <i>is</i> arbitrary: the delimiters and operators could just as easily be organized differently. Perhaps this particular organization makes certain programs clearer, but it loses the ability to represent programs in general.<p>If that doesn't make sense, think of the fairy tale of the goose that lays golden eggs. Everybody's obsessed with their particular golden egg. Lisp - precisely because of the difference visible in those two examples - is the goose.<p>There's nothing in this that PG didn't already express in his comment. But what you wrote deserves more than one protest :)",1250930794

This piece struck me as pretty good journalism on something pretty important, and I think it would be good for credibility all round to give them that.<p>Admittedly, the sources are anonymous, but could one expect otherwise given the material? I also appreciate the piece's directness, which is a refreshing contrast to the mealy-mouthed, there-is-no-truth-only-opposing-opinions cowardice of the MSM. (Of course, if you're going to say outright that someone is lying you had better be sure you are right.)<p>By the way, was the Techcrunch story on Last.fm definitively discredited?

779148,comment,778593,778593,0,0,billswift,,,"I'm not much of a programmer yet, and a lot of the C bashing I read complains about pointers and how necessary they are in C, yet according to this:<p>""Dynamic typing. In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers. Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.""<p>They are even more fundamental to LISP. Also if dynamic typing is good and most posts seem to claim it is, and dynamic typing more or less equals pointers which is what this seems to be saying, doesn't that mean using pointers is good?  Also, I have seen frequent complaints about C's ""static typing"", but if using pointers results in dynamic typing, doesn't that suggest that static or dynamic typing is a stylistic choice in C programming?",1250928486

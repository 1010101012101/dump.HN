No idea if it’s true or not, but it’s an interesting insight:<p><i>As one of the engineers who worked on Kindle, I'd like to point out that most people at Amazon are pretty anti-DRM themselves - it's the PUBLISHERS who insisted on it, and we put in DRM so as to keep THEM happy, because without publishers, there are no books to sell. We knew full well that the device and DRM would be hacked eventually - the hope was that we could just stay ahead of them for long enough to prove the feasibility of selling books in this way to publishers.</i>",1261565383

Even though /b/ contains the best and worst of the net, the other boards are quite reasonable (as long a /b/ stays up to keep the trolls from wandering).

It tries to define OOP and considers it necessity.<p>Personally i think FP is complementary to OOP and Haskell could be OOP according the articles definition (OOP=polymorphism).

1011882,comment,1011258,1011720,0,0,demallien,,,"No, really not.  Australia is not being taken to task for several reasons:<p>1) Unlike China, Australia was a signatory to Kyoto (actually, I'm not 100% sure if China was a signatory or not, but at any rate they didn't have binding targets).<p>2) Unlike the US, Australia actually met its Kyoto targets.<p>3) Everyone knows that most of Australia's economic activity is geared towards exports of primary produce to the rest of the world - as already noted, Australia's own population is small, certainly not big enough to consume even a tenth of what is being produced.  As such, at Kyoto it was agreed to not heavily limit Australian emissions, as these emissions would more fairly be placed on the books of the consumer countries.<p>4) Australia was willing and able to play ball in Copenhagen, unlike the Chinese.<p>5) Australia does not have very much diplomatic clout, so it is not being held accountable for the failure of diplomacy, as the US is.<p>6) And, finally, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what Australia does per capita, as its population is simply too small to make a difference on a global scale - even if we accept the dodgy figure of Australia emitting 11 times more per capita than the Chinese, that still means that China is emmitting more than 5 times more than Australia. Using more realistic figures, China is emitting about 10 times more than Australia, and the US is emitting nearly 20 times more.  And that is why no-one is pointing the finger at Australia.",1261564545

1011859,comment,1010997,1010997,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I find it interesting the he suggests <i>requiring</i> a minor in another field. I largely agree with this, but at my school, you can't get a minor if you're a CS major. For instance, by the time I graduate, I will have the required credits for a minor in math. That minor won't be recognized by the university, and I can only say that I've completed the courses for a math minor without actually earning one.<p>The same is true for double-majoring. I have a friend that wanted to double major in CS and linguistics to do AI, but he was told that he couldn't. Instead, he has to stick around for an extra year to get two distinct degrees. He's had to waste time because some of the courses he needed to take required you to have declared a major in that field.<p>This is from a school that probably has a more vocationally applied view of a CS degree. We are, for instance, required to take two semesters of software engineering. They're obviously interested in giving a student an education that will be useful in the industry, but they also have inane rules like the one described above.",1261562515

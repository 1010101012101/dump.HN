Once you find yourself in the right place at the right time, there is also the matter of recognizing a great opportunity and risking your own capital and reputation by pursuing it with full force. That is much harder than most people imagine.",1256065155

Which is what I believe.<p>""'The government' is hardly a single entity.""<p>The people are different, but if the Milgram experiments (and sociology in general) have taught us anything, it's that a person's social influences are as important to their decision making as their intrinsic character. And the laws, rewards, and punishments are largely the same across departments.<p>I realize the EPA is different from the FDA. However, the reasons why the EPA buried studies about the amount of mercury in freshwater the day before issuing new guidelines on acceptable mercury levels are largely the same as the reasons why the FDA approved OTC plan-B only for women 18+.<p>The takeaway is that bad things don't (usually) happen because of bad people. They happen because organizational behavior, psychology, and sociology allow us to make an educated guess that if an organization looks like X, then what tends to happen will be Y.<p>Now if I see patterns across organizations that you don't see, maybe that makes me a conspiracy theorist and maybe I'm seeing patterns that aren't there. Or maybe I just see patterns that you don't see.<p>I agree that at the end of the day you have to think about these problems individually for yourself. I don't actually believe the vaccines are all that dangerous, but at the same time I'm not going to take them just because the CDC or NIH or whatever say they are safe. The reason is that the people running these departments are operating under largely the same structures and incentives as the people running every other government department, and history as a whole shows that these sets of structures and incentives tend to produce unsavory behavior.",1256064966

We all know how time consuming building websites and apps can be. Due to our daily activities- work, school, ect, we can not devote a lot of our time to coding software to satisfy the need or needs of our user base. As a result, some programs get strached, and other aren't sucessful. That being said, KATO opensource can be used to reach your core audience in ways not yet imagined. With KATO, one can easily and quickly code up an agent( micro -programs), or group of agents to satisfy the needs of their end users.Currently, KATO opensource supports JAVA and PHP. Other languages will be added in the future. From a developer's standpoint, KATO is a proactive, and innovative way to interact with one's customers and end users.<p>Take a look at the following example: Mark is a developer who developed a piece of software that allows users to subscribe to multiple blogs and news website, and categorize them by topic. Instead of an devloping an entire website with a UI, system architecture, etc, Mark can use KATO which already has a UI, databases, backend, etc to quickly code up an agent or group of agents to satisfy his end users.<p>KATO equals a faster, and efficient way!<p>. \nvisit  <a href=""http://kato-agency.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kato-agency.blogspot.com/</a>  for more info\nfollow KATO on twitter:  <a href=""http://kato-agency.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kato-agency.blogspot.com/</a>",1256062925

You can't sustain forking per web request on a really large site but at this scale it's not going to matter.<p>The author is being stupid: the size of the process that you're forking doesn't really matter (it might start to matter if you didn't call exec() or exit() right after you forked, but that's not the case: you're just execing another program, which replaces the current process in memory).

There are no credible studies pointing to ill health effects outside of extremely rare cases in which a person is allergic to some part of the vaccine or has some other pre-existing condition.  And there are numerous studies indicating that you're more likely to get struck by lightning than to have any reaction to a vaccine, outside of a sore arm.<p>2) ""The government"" is hardly a single entity.  You're displaying conspiratorial thinking here, which is pretty tough to take seriously.  You're discussing the EPA and NY city government, which is not the same as the NIH and CDC.  Additionally, it's not only the U.S. government which is strongly recommending these vaccines.  If you'd like to continue that line of argument, you'll have to take it up with probably every single first-world government.<p>3) Being an intelligent and rational person means evaluating claims individually, regardless of the source.  Starting from the position that the government is lying to you is just as stupid as assuming they're always telling the truth.

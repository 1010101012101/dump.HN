You might think it&#x27;s a problem, that the NSA is going to spy on you, or China is going to inject attacks into your requests to my server, but that&#x27;s your problem.<p>I&#x27;m not going to run a massively buggy TLS library with an API guide that would take a whole team of engineers <i>weeks</i> to decipher, just because you&#x27;re intensely paranoid about accessing game-related data over HTTP.<p>Seriously, look at the GnuTLS documentation sometime. It&#x27;s psychotic. As is MatrixSSL, PolarSSL, OpenSSL, and NSS. The closest to sanity I&#x27;ve ever seen was libtls, which is only on OpenBSD, still has lots of CVEs popping up, and can&#x27;t do non-blocking mode.<p>> What exactly is the massive burden with HTTPS?<p>1. write your own HTTPS server. I&#x27;ll wait a few months, or<p>2. find a library that&#x27;s easy to use and won&#x27;t expose my server to Heartbleed-like attacks, and<p>3. pay me $70/yr for the wildcard cert I would need.<p>I&#x27;ll cover the extra CPU costs, since you say they&#x27;re so small. (even though when people say &quot;small&quot;, they&#x27;re counting overhead as a percentage against a site running a bloated beast like Wordpress in PHP + MySQL.)<p>> there are free cert providers like StartSSL and more coming soon<p>That don&#x27;t provide wildcart certs (and I have a wildcard CNAME entry; and I make use of that.)<p>> The number of websites where I wouldn&#x27;t prefer encryption and identity authentication is around zero<p>And you&#x27;re free to not visit my site, just like I wouldn&#x27;t ever patronize a webstore that wasn&#x27;t HTTPS. That&#x27;s how markets are supposed to work. I don&#x27;t see why your browser has to make the decision for the both of us.<p>> and the number of websites where I&#x27;m okay with someone injecting arbitrary JavaScript is exactly zero<p>Honestly ... I would be okay with blocking Javascript over HTTP. But I think that&#x27;s more because I just hate Javascript :P<p>> would be much better spent actually trying to improve those circumstances<p>You seriously want me to write a TLS library?<p>My dream goal would actually be to have it built-into the sockets layer. If it could be enabled as easily as a setsockopt(SO_TLS_CERTIFICATE, (void*)certificatedata, ...); and OS updates could fix the security, I&#x27;d be a lot more inclined to get on board with the programming side.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution to the wildcard cert issue. I can&#x27;t well start up my own CA to give them out for free. I guess it would at least be nice to see if they ever tone down self-signed certs from &quot;WORSE THAN HITLER&quot; to &quot;at least equal to HTTP&quot; in terms of warning messages.

However not so many people are starting families when compared to former times, they are starting later too. What this means is fewer purchases of family cars and all those journeys to shops and schools.<p>We are also creatures of habit so we stick to the transport we know. What happens when previous generations literally clog up all the roads with their cars so there is no room for the cars that a new generation would potentially own? I think that this has happened, owning a car would be impossible in many parts of most city or town centres. If not actually impossible, just very expensive or a lot of hassle when it comes to parking. Why go through all of that when you can just hop on buses and trains, to catch up with games/reading/emails on the phone/tablet?<p>Once you have a generation that have settled in to using public transport or cycling the barrier to entry for motoring is quite high and there is no peer pressure or real benefit to having a car - unless a family comes along.<p>Whilst pockets of &#x27;peak car&#x27; may exist in cities realising that the car is totally impracticable, there will be growth in more pointless journeys between pointless places beyond the realms of suburbia. Outside the cities there is universal belief that you have to learn to drive as soon as possible, getting a job would be impossible without an ability to drive there.

And when they do, the police force will behave quite uncooperatively, testify only in favor of the accused police officer, evidence will get &quot;lost&quot; mysteriously, and so forth.<p>Plus, if somebody sues a police officer for brutality, the usual reaction is to counter-sue for slander or false accusation (falsely accusing somebody of a crime is itself a crime under German law). In these cases, the best one can hope for is that the police drops its charges if you drop yours.<p>I remember a case from a few years back that exemplifies the problem over here quite well: The police had a warrant so search the home of somebody accused of drug trafficking. They did however, by accident, drive to the wrong address and - because of alleged &quot;imminent danger&quot; - kick down the door. They did not find any drugs or other illegal stuff at the place (because it was the <i>wrong</i> place). But the person whose appartment they searched wanted the police to pay for his door. The police refused, so he sued. The judge&#x27;s statement when he dismissed the case came down to &quot;Tough luck, dude, deal with it&quot;.<p>I find the very idea of a &quot;Police Bill of Rights&quot; repulsive. The police&#x27;s job - formally speaking - is to enforce the law; as such, the law should be applied to them the same as to everybody else. \nIf anything, the police - precisely because they are allowed, under certain circumstances, to beat and kill people - should be held to a stricter standard.<p>It is also interesting that the police union here in Germany rarely if ever does what a union is supposed to do, namely to work towards better working conditions - better pay, shorter hours, and so forth - for their members, instead they mainly seem to advocate for more surveillance and against police accountability.",1430644584

After that point just trust the compiler.<p>It&#x27;s not too hard to get a mental model of lifetimes, really, and once you have it you can look at lifetime parameters and figure out what they mean and how they work with each other. You&#x27;re anyway implicitly thinking of them as scopes. I usually just ignore lifetime parameters -- they&#x27;re something you learn to gloss over whilst reading Rust code, and I only really read them (and try to understand them) when I have lifetime errors. Sometimes the lifetime error is due to something unfixable, in which case the compiler will often lead me through a wild goose chase saladifying the entire codebase, or the lifetime error is fixable, in which case the compiler&#x27;s suggestions <i>usually</i> work.

Ebooks\nsolve this problem completely. Moreover I mostly read books to do\nsomething with their content, to transform it, to think about\nit. Searching paper books, even when they have a good index (a rare\noccurence), is incomparably slower than &#x27;grepping&#x27; through my\nelectronic texts. The ability easily to cut-and-paste is also helpful.\nAs others have pointed out, Ebooks, at least on the devices I use to consume them, have one\ndisadvantage: the infinite amount of discraction that internet\nconnectivity brings.

And the problems need to be solved to receive the gift.. And I read these workarounds or solutions are basics of successful entrepreneurship.<p>Focus - Staying focused requires significantly more effort (even not doing anything is an effort). This is stressful. When I am working on X, my brain wants to switch to Y, and it goes on with multiple tasks. This used to drive me crazy in early days and had to find a solution early on. For me the solution was a bit change in work schedule, exercise and one ginseng based multivit a day.<p>Passion - I can work 100+ hour week consistently without burn out - only if I have do some creative work. For a repetitive or not-creative task - it gets boring soon and even 15 hrs a week is a struggle. This makes it very difficult to keep up with processes and discipline. This forces early delegation/automation of boring work and forces me to find out areas I like to work on. (Clearly this doesn&#x27;t work as an employee).<p>Attention to detail is deficient naturally, we have to work around this with discipline and practice even in non-entrepreneurial jobs. After some time we get pretty good at it (because of practice).<p>ADHD folks are likely to have failed a lot in early life. And I believe they are better equipped to tackle failure as adults.<p>People with ADHD may have a very diverse experience, they know something about everything - probably because they cannot focus/disregard in a natural way. Gaining expertise is more than just hard work for us.<p>When one cannot remember a lot of things, it forces you to keep it simple. Being a bit forgetful was a bad thing, but now it feels like a good thing - I am a programmer, and I tend to forget my own code if I do not work on it for couple of weeks. However that limitation forces me to write modularised intuitive code. I would consistently forget syntaxes of a language I worked for 5 years - but I would forever remember the patterns/designs I followed. I think, the world to us is more about patterns and behaviours rather than facts and figures. And it is easier to learn with the glass half-full.",1430643768

I got a Kindle a few years ago as a way to have a lot of reading material in a small space (and weight) for long trips.  It has served that purpose admirably.  Even at home, being able to change the type size as my eyes tire in the evening is pretty nice.  I can read any time and any place on my phone, including times and places where I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought a book (e.g. at lunch alone), and my reading progress is even synced with the Kindle back home.

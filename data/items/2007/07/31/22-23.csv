38193,comment,37928,38086,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'm saying that Y Combinator is a very small number of people providing startup and venture capital mentoring to a correspondingly large number of bright young people (not all of whom are technical).  I'm saying that if you tried to take a similarly small number of technical experts to support a similarly large number of fledgling companies, it probably wouldn't work.  <p>I'm not saying you have a bad idea, but it's an important question and ""hiring programmers"" isn't really a good answer.   If I was a good hacker, and I could take 6% from 30 little companies and do all their coding in 3 months, that might be fun and profitable.  I think the chances of you finding someone that capable and willing to take the risk are slim, is all.",1185922246

You try to make a point but suddenly mention an irrelevant point that is correct but unrelated to the argument you are trying to make.  <p>Yes that is one of PG's themes(habits can be changed)  but it does not relate to believing that advertising is behavior control and holding this to be true will lead to full savings.<p>",1185921801

38186,comment,38028,38044,0,0,palish,,,"While I can agree with some of what you said, penny-pinching can be really bad if you take it too far.  One of the Xobni guys wrote something like, ""A good startup founder can create (some value >= $50 per hour) of wealth.  So if you spend an hour and save $10, it costs you.""",1185920945

You're not the contents of your wallet.""<p>The first rule of YCombinator is..<p>This is a good essay.  My mother has a basement full of stuff, hallways full of stuff, and recently moved into my grandmother's house and filled her living room with stuff.  Magazines, boxes.. Any average person would be appalled.  <p>She'd probably read this essay and go ""Hmm.. Yeah, that's about right"", then go buy another piece of furniture from Ikea.  ",1185920528
38184,comment,38028,38172,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""It used anecdotes from childhood claiming X is bad, then mentions full savings as if that is the direct correlation between the two.""<p>I actually believe there <i>is</i> a direct correlation - anecdotes (sometimes) lead to habits, and then habits lead to savings.  It's much easier to form habits in childhood, which is why I picked childhood anecdotes.  But it can be done late in life too - I think that was part of the point of PG's essays.",1185920470

I should not have responded as confrontation is bad on boards that could lead to meeting others in real life.<p>Basically I found the comment that I commented on deceptive.

Then we haven't really advanced the discussion much, have we?<p>Maybe you want to have a ""big government"" argument, but forget all of that. I'll assume you are correct. This is a type of thing that of necessity needs regulation. There are other enterprises just like this one who were not regulated. So why now? Why this? Certainly you don't feel like the actions were just random -- somebody rolls a dice and picks these guys out. I mean, as good and as wonderful and as healthy as all these restrictions are, they have to come from <i>somewhere</i>, right?<p>Pick your favorite thing you wanted the government to do or not do over the last 20 years that never happened. Why did the government do <i>some</i> things and not others? Is there some secret logic or calculus that is used to determine which things to fix and which not to fix? Or is it just votes?<p>I mean, you understand the reason for political parties, right? The use of force to protect interests. The speeches are all about bunnies and apple pie and protecting orphans, but bunnies and apple pies and orphans don't vote or make campaign contributions, do they?<p>Sorry about the cynicism, but there's a very interesting economic lesson going on here that has to do with startups, so I thought it worthwhile to point out.<p>Not trying to get in an argument, although I have no doubt that I've gotten into one.

This assumption rests upon causality.</i><p>There have been sci-fi space drives involving the separation of inertia and mass.  I wonder about a space drive based on the separation of causality and time.  Perhaps there is a ""causal dimension"" or axis which happens to be the same for everything in this universe, which is what we call time.  What if we can rotate this causal axis in a small region, like something the size of a ship?  We should be able to exceed the speed of light.  Something like this is supposed to happen when one falls through an event horizon.  Inside an event horizon, all of the timelike directions intersect the singularity.  That would be an interesting conceit: The observations that would easily reveal the physics of FTL travel are only available to observers who have passed an event horizon.",1279982915

And I didn't even have to take the class to figure it out: I just listened to one recorded lecture by the guy.<p>His <i>idee fixe</i> is understandable. It's a story as old as the Greeks, who wrote the myth of Cassandra for a reason: You set out to discover something important, and you <i>do</i>, and the answer is seemingly <i>obvious</i>, especially to a highly rational person... and yet society just can't seem to act on that obvious answer, and people's lives just continue being screwed up. It works on your nerves, over the years.<p>(I used to work in cancer research, and I get a small pang of this feeling every time I see a lit cigarette. So far I have been able to control my impulse to whip out the scale model of the diseased human lung and confront people with it, like that guy in the movie <i>Clerks</i>. But if I spent another twenty years in the field I'm not sure I'd be so restrained.<p>Similarly, I met a cardiologist and the guy was pretty animated when selling me on the advantages of exercise. There's something about watching people die on a daily basis that makes you a very forceful salesman.)<p><i>what's going on with all of these people who write such glowing reviews of the process?</i><p>I also think it's partly the Efficacy Fallacy: When you make a decision to do something, you have a powerful internal motivation to defend the efficacy of that action. After all, nobody likes to think of themselves as stupid, and it actually is a bad idea to second-guess yourself every ten seconds. So your decisions have a psychological momentum that takes time to wear off.<p>That would explain why people embark on these life-changing crazy ideas, then enthuse loudly about them for a certain number of months, and then <i>quietly</i> give them up. I've been there.<p>It's also worth remembering that, like drunkenness and drug addiction, chronic sleepiness has a ""death spiral"" pattern: It impedes your judgement, which causes you to do stupid things, which may impede your judgement further...<p>It is also likely that this weird sleep cycle <i>does</i> ""work"" for some people. A few people may have really odd biological clocks. Others may find that the ill effects of messed-up circadian rhythms are canceled out by some <i>good</i> effect, in their particular circumstance, or for their particular psychology. If you desperately need to escape a miserable home life, becoming a marine and being shipped off to war might be a net win, and if you desperately want to hack on the lab full of million-dollar equipment -- or you desperately need to get out of sync with the time-wasting meetings that dominate your daytime office life -- having a crazy sleep schedule might be a net win.

But here is the thing – do you think it is fair for someone else to subsidize your children (at the cost to themselves)?<p>It is usually the duty of parents to raise their children (and pay for their education). The left however feels that it “takes the village to raise the child” (nice way of saying that someone else should pay for education, etc…). This means that dysfunctional people and families can externalise the consequences of their actions.<p>If we think of it in a crude way: wouldn’t the most fit evolutionary strategy in such a system be to just get as much children as you want? Since someone else will bust their but to pay for the raising and education of your child.<p>This is unfortunately what happens in many countries, and it is quite sad. In my country there are 13.4 million people on government grants and there are 12 million people working. Of those that work, only about 3 million pay tax (75% which is paid by 750,000). Of the 13.4 million receiving “social grants”, about 9 million are child grants (government pays them for each child under 16, thereby encouraging people to get children. Many people receive the child grant from their children before they stop getting their own grant).<p>The point of this is that each tax payer is paying to raise 3 children that are not theirs. Is that fair? Should someone really be allowed to get children if they cannot afford them?<p>This is also one of the reasons I believe that democracy does not work in most countries – especially countries with a high population or which is not homogeneous.<p>The excuse of “family location” is BS. Many people have put off or postponed having children until they can afford them, and at least kept the number of children to a minimum. Many people also at least put in the effort to raise the kids that they have properly.",1279981394

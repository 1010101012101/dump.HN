If you invent a name for your menu item, or use an existing name not common in the vernacular, you avoid most psychological associations with those words.  You can describe a Reuben without ever using the words &quot;sandwich&quot;, &quot;meat&quot;, or &quot;bread&quot;, for instance.<p>Reuben: corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on rye; lightly toasted<p>You can even avoid saying &quot;beef&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, or &quot;dressing&quot;.<p>Reuben: cured brisket, sauerkraut, Emmentaler, and Thousand Island on marbled rye; lightly toasted<p>&quot;Reuben&quot; is not a replacement for &quot;sandwich&quot;.  That&#x27;s what it is, after all.  But for this particular menu item, no one ever reads the word &quot;sandwich&quot;, nor are they likely to say it when ordering.  And when that word is not present, people are less likely to associate the restaurant dish with the thing they can almost certainly make at home at lower cost.  That&#x27;s the whole point.  You&#x27;re trying to avoid activating certain areas of the human brain that tend to rein in impulses and encourage activation of areas that stimulate reward-seeking behaviors.<p>It isn&#x27;t rocket science, but it is a science.  People get paid to experiment on how to encourage people to spend more money in retail stores, and the results they get are often significant enough to sell to businesses.  Once you can see these particular fnords, you notice them everywhere.  It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I can hardly stand eating in casual dining chain restaurants any more: I see puppet strings attached to everything, from the moment I see the building to the second I leave.",1431356382

9525218,comment,9521867,9524014,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,">BBS was the best system ever except for the horrible busy signal because someone was signed on.<p>By the mid-80s multi-line BBS&#x27;s were supported, the question is whether the operator could afford them. When I was a kid I was dialing into a multi-line chat BBS in the Chicago suburbs. I also dialed into a few traditional BBS&#x27;s that had 2-4 lines. The BBS revolution was ultimately self-limited. Phone lines were very expensive and that limited who could call you and how many users you could support. It was tough to monetize BBS&#x27;s as everyone just kept redialing the free ones as opposed to busy-free access to the paid ones (sound familiar?) BBS&#x27;s were a stop gap measure until we could get real digital connections to the home.<p>Its incredible how the phone monopoly never really understood this outside of super-expensive and super-slow ISDN.  Why we didn&#x27;t have a DSL-like product in the mid to late 80s is beyond me. The demand certainly was there as geeks and businesses were butting their heads on POTS limitations by then.  I guess that&#x27;s just how phone monopolies work. In my neck of the woods the first available broadband wasn&#x27;t DSL. It was Comcast cable.  For all the shit cable providers get, in the early days, they helped keep the phone monopolies honest. The same way google fiber is keeping them honest today and how 2gbps Comcast service is keeping AT&T gigapower honest, etc.",1431356335

We have brunch at one of the dozen restaurants we can get to within a few blocks&#x27; walk. We can walk to the park, walk to the drugstore to get the diaper cream we forgot to buy. We can have impromptu, unscheduled social events just by running in to the 3-4 other couples with kids our age who live in our apartment building. And narrow little pedestrian-oriented streets, which we don&#x27;t have where we live but would love to, are a whole lot more toddler friendly than ones primarily designed for cars.<p>If anything, the advantages of city living are magnified for people with kids. When I was single, I thought nothing of driving 15-20 minutes on a weeknight to meet some friends for dinner. That&#x27;s a non-starter with kids.

There&#x27;s no reason we should have problem downloading photos from our phones and sending them to family. And it was easier in the pre-smartphone/early smartphone era than it is today.<p>I blame the same force that gave us our progress - capitalism, the market economy, and the mindset it promotes among management. In established markets, all the easy things have already been solved - you can&#x27;t win any more customers by creating quality products. You have to squeeze money out of perfectly working things. This is where the engine of capitalism stops being aligned with humanity&#x27;s needs.<p>There&#x27;s a business term for all that crap - &quot;value-added&quot;. When you see some &quot;value-added&quot; thing it means that the company is about to shit on you to get more money, either from you or someone else. We didn&#x27;t have that much crapware on computers until vendors realized they could get paid by third parties by bundling their worthless (for end-user) crap. It&#x27;s a gamble that worked well for the companies - people will deal with crap because they don&#x27;t have any other choice, and vendors get more profit.<p>Then there&#x27;s completely purposeful degradation. Some of the things we had much better 60 years ago than today: shoes, clothes, kettles, lightbulbs, utensils, kitchenware, various home appliances. Sure, they weren&#x27;t that shiny and plastic, they didn&#x27;t have an army of &quot;designers&quot; behind them, but they fucking worked <i>and they still fucking work today</i>. I still have a microwave bought ~20 years ago in Sweden, and it fucking works and never had a single glitch. My grandfathers have equipment bought when they were young, whereas my shoes and clothes degrade within half a year or less.<p>This is the problem. We know very well how to make good things.

The problem however (at least in my area - education) has come from the DB admins not wanting anyone to access &quot;their&quot; data due to security and speed concerns. Their solution - give someone CSV output from the table rather than allow then read only access to the data. Problem is you get CSV files saved to excel files and you end of with thousands of Excel files floating around between people all based off the same sets of data - that if given a better method of direct access could be more accurate and effective. The lack of a direct connection to the database of record is what I have seen causes much of the overuse of Excel and if more tools (i.e. Tableau) were implemented to make those connections I think (again in my area at least) the use of Excel would dramatically decrease.",1431355567

You could travel to another country where they arrest you for something unencrypted you did online in a country where it was legal. This has already happened. [1]<p>2. Your communications could become evidence in court that you &quot;always had radical leanings.&quot; So while you&#x27;re not convicted for what you did online, it still becomes evidence against you. I suspect this has already happened.<p>3. You could travel to another country where retroactive laws are allowed, and get caught because of something you said in the past in the US.<p>4. The US could eventually allow retroactive laws, and catch you for something you did before retroactive laws were allowed.<p>Note: these are just ways you could get in trouble with the law; not mentioned are things like your reputation being destroyed, death threats, identity theft, or malware due to lack of encryption.

9525022,comment,9523555,9524532,0,0,lectrick,,,"> Yet, there is seemingly no compelling answer to them that doesn&#x27;t involve bringing your passport to a key signing party.<p>The only reason I trust the source of an email by its &quot;from&quot; address is because of the history of correspondence with that person from that address. Yes, if it is compromised, I may not realize it right away, or I may (see: phishing emails from virus/malware infestations), but by and large it works as advertised.<p>Same thing with usernames in forums. There&#x27;s a certain cred that is eventually attached to a username over time.<p>If I use the same public key to represent myself in all my communication &quot;for a while&quot;, then there&#x27;s implicit trust that it&#x27;s me there, for the same reasons.<p>Key revocation is admittedly not as simple, if I want to continue to maintain my &quot;trust balance&quot; somehow. What happens if I switch email addresses? &quot;Hi guys, this is my new email address.&quot; What if I was compromised and someone else did that? (Well, how often does that happen in real life?)<p>Perhaps you could keep one key super secret (and offline) and sign all new day-to-day keys with it. I don&#x27;t know.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is- Treat it like email. Forget trying to centralize who owns what key. Forget trying to exercise absolute control over trust in a given key. The key(s) I use &quot;most of the time&quot; is &quot;me&quot;. If I need to revoke it, I will suffer some in the short term, but I will quickly build my cred back up by using a new one.<p>If it was more widespread then perhaps we could centralize SOME third-party signing. Say I could go to a bank and they could sign my key saying &quot;this key definitely belongs to lectrick&quot;, and it would work because the bank&#x27;s public key is known-trusted.",1431354810

To be fair, this is <i>one</i> incident we&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s some common occurance, nor is it in this particular case clear-cut that they wouldn&#x27;t have been extradited even if they weren&#x27;t handed over to the CIA.

9525020,comment,9523982,9524571,0,0,fullwedgewhale,,,"Google puts out free or cheap services and devices because they&#x27;re trying to draw users to their platform, which gathers metrics about usage.  These feed into the services, but they also feed in to Google&#x27;s need to be a better advertising platform.  Although we think of Google as the company behind the eponymous search engine and Android phone, it&#x27;s actually an advertiser.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still in the 95% range, but it&#x27;s still high.  I have a 7&quot; Nexus tablet which (for the time) was a great tablet at an insanely good price.  But I knew I was essentially giving up information about what I read, what I listen to, and what apps I used in exchange for the free services and discounted device.<p>In contrast my Apple devices aren&#x27;t cheap, and there is less collection of data with the intent of selling my attention to third party advertising clients, but they are more expensive and I pay an iCloud subscription fee.  For the most part the Mac software doesn&#x27;t suck and works reasonably well.  I don&#x27;t love everything about it but it&#x27;s more appealing than Picasa for photos.  I do pay for extra storage on Google to back up my pictures (over 100 gigs of family photos).  But I am definitely paying more Apple in a direct sense (buying computers and phones + iCloud) than to Google (Google Play and 1 device).  Apple&#x27;s margin on hardware is high, but they make a quality product (for the most part).<p>What I give Google is information about myself, my work, my family, the music I listen to, the books I read, and anything and everything I ever searched for.  They&#x27;re pretty open and transparent about this, and I pretty much understand what I&#x27;m turning over in exchange for their free stuff.  See the Google dashboard on you.  If there&#x27;s an application or service hosted by Google, I pretty much understand their intent is to extract data from that service or application.<p>That works for most people, even though they really don&#x27;t understand this exchange or think about it.  Free is a powerful lure and most consumers have come to expect not to pay anything at all for software and services.  That&#x27;s why they download a free game and keep playing it even when they find out it sends the contents of their address book off to some weird holding company.  It&#x27;s also why they get suckered into free games (because 4.99 is just too expensive on an App store) and then spend multiples of that amount in in-game purchases.  It&#x27;s why they&#x27;re willing to turn over even extremely intimate details of their life for free e-mail or messaging services.<p>But the incentive for Google is not to make great software or hardware because that&#x27;s how they make their money.  Their incentive is to roll out services which help them collect information to feed their need for information about your tastes and behaviors.  If that photo app you&#x27;re using doesn&#x27;t really give them more information, there&#x27;s no incentive to make it better.  Apple has an incentive to make software good enough to support their device/computer sales.  Microsoft (arguably) has an incentive to make software good enough for manufacturers to license it.  Apple and Microsoft, no matter how much people love to shit on them, actually have more straight forward, simple motives.  They have an actual financial incentive to care about the quality of the product they deliver because you are paying them (directly or indirectly).<p>tl;dr  Google only makes software good enough to draw you in to collect data.  Other vendors are selling yous something and therefore have an interest in making that thing better.",1431354744

The question is whether there are some Swedes <i>with sufficient reach</i> willing to go far enough.<p>E.g. some years back, Swedish police black bagged two political asylum seekers from Egypt and illegally handed them over to the CIA, knowing the CIA would fly them to Egypt and hand them over to Mubarak. Sweden asked for a &quot;promise&quot; they&#x27;d not be tortured, which they promptly were of course. The entire operation violated by Swedish law and international law, was condemned by the UN and Sweden has been ordered to pay restitution over it.<p>Yet a few years later, Swedish military police uncovered that the CIA were still conducting illegal rendition flights via Sweden, with the cooperation of Swedish ground staff. We know about the latter only because Wikileaks years later reported on how the US ambassador to Sweden was called in to the Swedish foreign ministry over the matter. We don&#x27;t know whether there have been further &quot;issues&quot; because it has never been investigated thoroughly by anyone that we know of, and certainly not publicly.<p>Clearly some Swedes - including police officers - were ok with blatantly ignoring Swedish law in the first matter, and some were willing to continue cooperating with the CIA illegally even after the massive uproar of the first revelations, and after it was clear political authorities at least in public opposed it, and at the same time as other parts of the Swedish government were prepared to take action against it.",1431354631

9524876,comment,9522037,9523675,0,0,CPLX,,,"I started my career as a recording studio engineer, and was in fact a regular reviewer of professional audio equipment for a national magazine for years, so I fit one of the two groups you mention.<p>The short answer, honestly, is that the two groups have little in common. The community of people in pro audio are usually very pragmatic people with comprehensive experience and context with audio (i.e. they are musicians themselves, or experts in movie soundtracks, etc) and more to the point have excellent and relatively unbiased &quot;ears&quot; and listening abilities.<p>Basically any audio engineer with actual real life professional experience and success (i.e. not a &quot;hobbyist&quot;) can name half a dozen crappy cheap things that sound way better than the high end alternative in their arsenal. Things like a $80 microphone that is just amazing on harmonica, or a 1980&#x27;s solid state compressor that is perfect for male vocals, etc etc.<p>And as a side note, professional engineers almost always have personal audio systems with pretty standard off the shelf equipment. I have never once in my life met a person who makes their living off of pro audio who has a &quot;hi-fi&quot; system of the type you see in stereo magazines. They almost invariably make equipment decisions with their ears.<p>By contrast, the high end &quot;stereophile&quot; community seems to be more of an analogue to the fashion industry. They are obsessive about concepts, like hand winding of copper, or ground isolation, or Class A or tube amplification, and so on. They care about checking off a list of things that an audio system is &quot;supposed to have&quot; and brand names and so on. Typically listening is a confirmation event for them, rather than a means for making decisions. I couldn&#x27;t speak to the listening chops of the journalists that cover these things, but the entire sector is based on fashion and spending money and its media reflects those values.<p>The high end stereophile sector is about a lot of things, but faithful audio reproduction doesn&#x27;t appear to be the highest priority on the list.<p>For anyone who actually wants to invest in a really high quality system to listen to audio on without getting sucked into this money bleeding insanity I recommend going to a high end pro audio store (such as B&H in New York or WPS in Washington DC, say) with a budget in mind ($1-3k should be more than sufficient) and getting someone to help you put a system together that will impress your friends.",1431353753

It turns out that &quot;state&quot; - like a door open or closed, is not easy to keep track of reliably. Caution is needed for anything else in the chain eg &quot;if door open for longer than 30 sec, sound alarm&quot;.<p>In the end, nothing beats a physical switch on the door (wireless battery operated), with hardware on/off states. Then the door can&#x27;t be mistaken ever as open or closed due to mis-matches in sending the state, or whatever other interference cause the &quot;door open&quot; state to get out of sync. If Ninja Blocks had made their own special little purpose-built wireless sensors and switches rather than use aftermarket, then things like state could have been sorted out early on IMHO.<p>The supplied door switch for example that came with the NB, triggered the same thing whenever the pin was moved in or out. The switch had no concept of open or closed or on/off, it just blurted the same signal each time it was triggered. Attempting to build &quot;state&quot; from such trigger data is never going to be reliable.<p>Knowing <i>without doubt</i> that your garage door is open or closed when looking at the app on your phone, is not something you want your security device to be wishy-washy about.

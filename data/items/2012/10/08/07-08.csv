But does it seem to you that the scope of the government has actually been limited as intended?<p>The problem is that all three branches gain when you increase the scope and power of government.  Therefore there is a small but consistent error on the side of expanding the government among all three groups.  The result is a government that is far larger than anything that the Founders envisioned.  Individually we may or may not think that this is a good change, but there is no question that it is not as intended by the original Constitution.<p>The place that you can see this most clearly is in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause</a>.  This gives Congress the power <i>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes</i>.<p>Until the 1930s, this was interpreted as written.  If an act of commerce didn't involve Indian tribes, multiple states, or foreign governments, then Congress couldn't justify laws about it under the Commerce Clause.  Then FDR wanted to pass the New Deal.  The courts struck down key provisions.  FDR threatened to appoint pliant judges until he got what he wanted.  A key vote switched, FDR got the decision he wanted, and the Commerce Clause began to expand to cover any activity that might possibly, some day, affect interstate commerce.  No matter how tangentially.<p>We went from, ""If it doesn't cross a boundary, Congress can't say anything"" to ""Even if you, your business, your employees, and most of your likely customers all exist in one state, Congress can still pass regulations about who you can hire.""  (Yes, I like the Civil Rights Act.  I'm just saying that it would not be constitutional under the Constitution as understood by Thomas Jefferson.)<p>From the first strong-arming of the Supreme Court to the next decision where the Commerce Clause was not upheld to cover whatever Congress asked for it to cover took 60 years.  (The Court finally hit its limit with an attempt to regulate the possession of handguns in the neighborhood of a school.)  Every expansive decision increased the scope of what the President could ask for, Congress could pass, and the potential impact of the corresponding cases that the Supreme Court had to judge.",1349681198

It may be that the factors supporting the finance of works with large creation expense are just an aberration and will disappear.

I think that arguing about absolute positions on copyright is silly. Throwing out copyright is a bad idea, but what we have in the US now-- de facto eternal copyright starving out the public domain-- is at least equally as bad.",1349679744

Correcting for an ineffective engine is a fantastic feat of engineering, but consider that the engine obliterated itself due to some other unknown flaw. The bigger issue with blowouts like tonights is that the violent nature of the event can damage surrounding engines, or the failure could be caused from a common system. SpaceX was lucky that it was a corner engine that exploded, as it was least-likely to damage any of the other engines. Excellent redundancy engineering allowed them to continue the climb to orbit, but only after they got lucky.<p>Then again, it is unfair of me to make relatively uninformed declaratives about tonight's launch. The engine blowout could have been cause by an incredibly unlucky set of circumstances, and the engineers at SpaceX could have built a vehicle that survived a catastrophic failure that would have doomed any other craft to date.<p>Given what I've seen from SpaceX, I am positive that they will get to the bottom of the incident and have it corrected before their next launch.",1349679656

As an employee of a company which sells GPL licensed software, I can tell you it's a very viable business model.<p>It's a viable business model in the small, not when you're developing software for a huge market where a handful of customers can't bankroll future versions of the software.<p>> Secondly, the idea that you are spied upon because it's free is very naive; how do you think Apple's Ad network (iAd) can target Demographics, Application preferences, Music passions, Movie, TV and audiobook genre interests and even Location? Guess what: the consumer is paying with cash and their privacy.<p>The point is that when companies cannot sell the software directly, they need to rely on alternative monetization models. A lot of those monetization models involve privacy-invasion through advertising, etc. Paying for software doesn't eliminate that obviously, but rather when software can't be sold as a product the equilibrium moves to a very different place.",1349679607

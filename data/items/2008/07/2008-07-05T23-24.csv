Basically,  you played both parts.<p>I simply offered an alternative to how those sorts of conversations go when I'm the one being asked.  You know, giving you an actual person so you don't have to play both parts.  It's more fun that way.<p>If you want to use a very particular definition of ""god""  to frame the discussion in your favor, that's great.

Let me explain...<p>I used to use what I thought was the ""best tool for the job"".  Javascript/HTML/CSS for the client, another language for the server, another DBMS, and a separate server.  And I spent half of my time trying to figure out why one thing didn't work with another.  It was never anything big, but just bad enough to slow me down (performance, scaling, security).<p>Then a friend asked why I was messing with all that.  He said to just download an Apache/PHP/MySql stack, install it, and forget about it.  So I did.<p>Sure I hate the syntax, especially the dollar signs starting variable names, but I have never had a problem getting it to do exactly what I wanted.  If I ever had a question, there were a hundred places to turn for help.  And I never had to worry about one technology working with another.<p>I've always been a non-conformist when it came to tech, probably to get an edge on everyone else.  But I learned the hard way, there's a time to conform and a time to be a maverick.  I'd rather conform with a standard platform and ""do my own thing"" with my apps.",1215301463

237399,comment,236853,236913,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Quite simply: it's insurance and state-mandated minimum child-provider ratios! The least we ever paid for childcare was $820/month and that was a very good preschool that had extremely low staff turnover -- we were lucky. When my son was younger, the costs were higher: infants cost over $1000/month.<p>That said, many people here in MN do in-home daycare which is usually much less expensive. Usually it's a parent who has decided to stay home with her baby and gets the training and insurance to care for other children as well to cover the cost of her leaving her job. 
However, as you get to the preschool years, the quality varies radically. They may give good childcare, but the learning experiences can be slim to none.
My son entered Kindergarten extremely well prepared and immediately outdistanced most of the other kids. Odds are that in-home daycare would not have prepared him for school as well.",1215299849

I know it&#x27;s rude mean and condescending but it&#x27;s the truth. And a lot of good people who simply happen to be poor end up getting caught in the same filter. There&#x27;s a percentage of poor people who are poor due to situations out of their control, luck, access to opportunity and other variables but a certain percentage are poor because their moral character is defective. HNers usually work white collar jobs and avoid dealing with the public so they never experience the bottom of society (lets say 5% of people) so they assume every human being is a good person when given the economic opportunity. That is not reality. That is wishful, hopeful thinking. There are a lot of people that are just defective by habit, character, moral values, work ethic, and will never get better. Those are the people that everyone&#x27;s trying to keep out of their neighborhoods. Since behavior laws are hard to create and enforce the only way to get away from the bottom 5% is to price them out of your neighborhood. Unfortunately it also prices out a lot of others.

In fact, I think this is -- among several other factors -- one of the primary causes of this migration.<p>The money an individual or a family has to spend is limited. For most, the rent is their single biggest expense: the less one makes, the more one has to give up (in terms of money that would go to savings, basic necessities, or food/entertainment) to live in a more desirable place.<p>Given that income distributions even with some amount of redistribution will still follow a power curve, it is quite possible that certain highly desirable areas -- themselves on a power curve of desirability -- might see great population growth, but -- on the whole -- the movement would not be to those areas. That is, unless, the supply of housing in those ares can keep up with the demand.",1389431600
7042111,comment,7040820,7041875,4,0,_delirium,,,"Yes, in general I think some paid editing is <i>better</i> than much of the free editing. People who edit for free are not all altruistic people who want to help advance human knowledge. Many of them choose an article to edit because they&#x27;re interested in advancing some specific agenda, such as their political, social, national, or other views, or engaging in general boosterism of their local city, community, university, software project, church, favorite band, etc. Many are not motivated to do proper research in libraries to support the additions they make to articles, or spend time educating themselves about multiple aspects of a topic before writing about it. People who are paid in &quot;Wikipedian in residence&quot; programs at a museum, to take an example of the &quot;gold standard&quot; paid editing programs that have worked well, typically make much better edits.<p>One <i>can</i> surely be a paid shill, but that&#x27;s just a good reason to look at whether the edits are any good. If someone is willing to fund non-shill editing that is actually good, then I&#x27;d say please do so, just like I encourage Red Hat funding paid open-source contributions. There are many situations where it is a win-win, when the interests of Wikipedia and the funder align (much like the interests of Red Hat and Linux often aligning).<p>For example, to take even a commercial example, I recently noticed that the Greek wine industry is currently very poorly covered on the English Wikipedia (even many of the basic grape varieties don&#x27;t have good articles about them, let alone any decent history of the industry itself). This is bad for the English Wikipedia (which has a geographical gap) and conceivably it&#x27;s even bad for the Greek wine industry (which has less information on its produce available to the internet-reading public). If some winemakers&#x27; organization was willing to fund a Wikipedian to go sit in a library for a few weeks and improve the articles on Greek grapes, wine legislation, producers, etc., I think that would be excellent for Wikipedia. It&#x27;s work that needs to get done eventually anyway, whether someone funds it or not, so a funder appearing would just provide resources to make it happen sooner rather than later.<p>Of course, if instead of funding a researcher who sits in a library and writes articles, they wanted to hire a promotional agent who writes fluffy PR copy, then <i>that</i> kind of paid editing should be frowned on and removed. But then it should be frowned on and removed even if it <i>weren&#x27;t</i> paid: if it were just a patriotic Greek puffing up his local wine for no pay because he loves it, that&#x27;s bad editing too. So to me it&#x27;s the nature of the editing that matters: is it encyclopedic, scholarly, referenced, or is it fluffy promotional stuff? Whether it&#x27;s paid or not doesn&#x27;t matter to me, because both paid and non-paid work can fall in either category.<p>Interestingly, this is much less controversial on some non-English Wikipedias. On the Swedish Wikipedia, paid editors are welcomed and encouraged, as long as they disclose their sources of funding and are careful about conflicts of interest. The focus is mostly just on &quot;onboarding&quot; them, to ensure they understand what is appropriate for a Wikipedia article and what isn&#x27;t. One heuristic is that paid editors generally shouldn&#x27;t <i>remove</i> information from an article, and shouldn&#x27;t engage in attempts to &quot;own&quot; a page (such as watching it over months and trying to control its direction). But just showing up and writing new material that was previously missing seems generally appreciated, as long as it&#x27;s suitably referenced and not PR copy.",1389431485

A true missing link would be an intermediate stage ...<p>They&#x27;re all species. There&#x27;s no such thing as an intermediate non-species. Species are conventionally defined as a group that breeds with its own group, and are distinguished by the fact that they cannot breed with other species. So all those intermediate stages were also species.<p>Some species didn&#x27;t last very long, and the farther back in time we go, the less chance we have of locating clear evidence for particular species. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t species, as that term is defined.",1380185201

Many people think that MS and traditional PC makers are taking a risk by making convertible/dual-use devices, but Apple is also taking a risk by not doing it. If the market decides that having a tablet that can multi-task as a fully fledged PC is a good idea, then Apple has a problem, because they can&#x27;t make OSX touch friendly in a hurry. Their other option is make iOS more capable and make it run on Macbook level devices, but this won&#x27;t be a quick task.<p>Many people will say that dedicated devices like tablets and laptops are what people want, but there are plenty of cases where a multi-use device succeeds.

6449554,comment,6448194,6448194,2,0,tsenkov,,,"I assume this discussion is already more about the transition from desktop to laptop, than about the PC to Mac etc.<p>Have you looked at Windows on 27&quot; Thunderbolt display?\nThe first time I saw that display with Mac OS X rendering on it, I thought: &quot;Wow, that looks awesome. The glare from the glass is bothering, so there&#x27;s that, but placed right in the room, it&#x27;s totally fine and well worth for that size and clarity.&quot;.<p>Then I went to the specs and saw that the PPI of this monitor was exactly 6 points above my own (1920x1080, 21.5&quot;, 102 ppi vs. 108 ppi)? Is it possible 6 points to be such a differentiator?<p>Of course, it turned out it wasn&#x27;t - I immediately tried windows on the same Mac machine and there it was - everything looked almost as badly as on my own PC.<p>So, I asked the guy that owns the machine (he is a graphic designer), why there is such a difference and he said: &quot;Microsoft simply doesn&#x27;t care enough about detail. Check the default icon sizes in the OS - OS X&#x27;s icons on regular-density display (non-retina) are 4x bigger (512x512 vs. 256x256 on windows) and on retina this grows to 16x more pixels (1024x1024).&quot;<p>So factor #1, IMHO, is people ditch Desktop PCs because of Microsoft&#x27;s lack of flexibility and innovation - they decided &quot;If we have a monopoly over desktop computing, why should we care what our users say? They still buy &#x27;it&#x27;.&quot;.<p>Factor #2 - Microsoft still has the numbers!!! They have locked the enterprise tight, and still don&#x27;t care about &quot;personal&quot; user experience.<p>So we have this giant corporation that gets enough money and has no incentive to innovate and we hope it will bring us the great singularity of software and hardware we have all been waiting for...<p>And the last factor I will point out is relevant mostly to developers - Mac hardware runs it all. Then having a Windows and a Mac machine, doesn&#x27;t really make sense, both as expenses and simplicity of work.<p>Apple made the, arguably, &quot;evil-corporate&quot; decision to be totally in control of the hardware running its OS. So you, developers, have the option to buy:<p>- iMac, that sits tight on your desk + Macbook (probably Air) for your work on the go;<p>- Mini + Thunderbolt + Macbook (probably Air);<p>- Pro + Thunderbolt + Macbook (definitely Air after what you paid for the previous 2);<p>- Macbook Pro.<p>Well, as I see it, most developers are headed for the Macbook Pro with eventually adding a Thunderbolt.<p>For developers in need to support the Mac ecosystem, this is not even #3 reason - it&#x27;s #1. I had to make this transition and I am glad I did, because Mac OS X turned out to be no less then great, and although smaller in size, my 15.4&quot; retina display got me into the 21st century. :)",1380184687

Web browsers and word processors gain new bells and whistles, but the basic functionality is the same as it ever was. You can run a bajillion windows at once, watch Netflix at HD resolution, and not slow down. Games are near-photorealistic. What more do we <i>want</i> a computer to do, exactly?<p>You mention resolution--once the pixels are smaller than the naked eye can distinguish at typical viewing distance, everything else is polish and marketing. Yes, I know, retina displays are indefinably &quot;crisper&quot;, or something.

You can do crypto in JS, just don&#x27;t download it every time (distribute signed packages via browser add-ons). The part of the article that attacks extensions just makes a bunch of assumptions (like, you&#x27;re going to download scripts and eval them from your extension). It&#x27;s a leap.<p>Plus that article attacks JS doing crypto that the server will <i>decrypt</i> (which, yes is useless, use TLS). It doesn&#x27;t address using browser add-ons to do AES encryption, have your data stored on the server in encrypted form, and only decrypted when you download it again.<p>Is this method flawed? Only if you do a web-app instead of a browser add-on. Once you package the client code, it can be just as hard to break as something like KeePass (assuming the add-on itself has a decent security policy, ie don&#x27;t eval()code from random places).<p>Plus, modern browsers now have &quot;window.crypto&quot; which provides a PRNG. So there goes that argument.<p>The article is just completely wrong in many ways. The only valid point I see it make is about garbage collection and potential for reading decrypted memory directly (MANY languages have this problem, not just JS).<p>One of the points you brought up is extremely valid though: LastPass is closed-source, so it&#x27;s nearly impossible to truly validate the crypto.

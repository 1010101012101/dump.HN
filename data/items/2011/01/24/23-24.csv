2137323,comment,2137019,2137306,0,0,Swizec,,,"Actually we have tried python-readability. The problem is if you want to run it on AppEngine you can't use lxml (no C code) so you're stuck with BeautifulSoup. It was also hellishly expensive, I think that experiment cost us ~$10 an hour in CPU costs.<p>As a result, it's better to stick with the javascript version of readability and run it in node.js. It's perhaps a dash slower than a python version would be, but the results are much much better and it's easier to keep up to date.",1295913271

This would easily provide the required resolution, the huge problem however is combining the images from both telescopes in such a way to realize the resolution. As far as I know right now that technology is not available. Even if the technology was available, the unsteadiness of the Earth's atmosphere would likely render the method useless.</i><p>I've read about this method being used a lot in radioastronomy.

2137183,comment,2136744,2137133,0,0,cletus,,,"Are you talking a modern condo? If so I believe it. If not, you can find places for cheaper than that. Put it this way last month I rented a 1BR in a Chelsea brownstone for $2,000/month (which is generally more expensive than Midtown).<p>But think about those numbers for a second. $2500/month is $30,000pa or a 3% gross return, even less once you factor in maintenance. To put that in perspective, 5% gross return seems to be the benchmark in Australia (although in Australia there tends to be a tradeoff between capital growth and annual income).<p>In London I've seen the gross return be 10% <i>or even higher</i>.<p>So who would invest $1 million for a <2% gross return? That's nothing but a bet on future capital gains. In other words it's speculative. So the question is: is that sustainable (meaning will rents go up to match) or unsustainable (meaning prices will stagnate or go down)?<p>On a side note, some may consider it strange that I'm talking about the rent figure as a return. I've certainly spoken to many people who can't look past the speculation but that income is really important as it does relate to the asset price. They simply can't get too far out of whack sustainably.<p>Commercial or industrial property tends to be judged much more on viewing the property as an asset that generates income (Las Vegas casinos notwithstanding).",1295910507

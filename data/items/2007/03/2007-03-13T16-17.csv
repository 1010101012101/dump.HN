I'm only 24 and still in school as of the moment, yet I'm more than willing to leave school in order to initiate my start up. Come to think of it, I'm willing to travel half the world just to get advice and connections from YC. ",1173805199

3907,comment,3857,3896,0,0,JMiao,,,"Guy gave a fantastic talk at Stanford a few weeks ago.  I'll admit that I was initially skeptical given the many posts that have appeared on the web questioning his track record.  In response Valleywag's sarcastically-titled ""Guy's Golden Touch,"" Guy had this to say:<p>""It's not really Guy's golden touch.  It's more like 'anything golden, Guy touches.'""<p>In all seriousness, though, my first-hand experience with Guy has given me a lot of confidence in him as a VC.  He's frank about his own professional experiences, going as far as to count his time at Apple a ""failure"" because Apple never realized their initial goal of dominating the personal computer business.<p>I understand how track record plays a role in fundraising, but too many people overestimate a VC's track record and underestimate personal attention/advice.  This isn't to say that the big VCs aren't good -- one of Sequoia's partners gave me great advice when I was a sophomore in college -- but I think that there is a false pretense amongst startups that raising money from big-name investors is somehow in itself a measure of success (it's like being proud of your mortgage).",1173803946

3904,comment,3891,3891,0,0,danielha,,,"There will invariably be those who don't see the success they set out for, and they fall back to their original path. <p>That's why a founder's commitment is so critical. When your one plan is to become a startup founder, regardless of school or any other factors, you will do your damndest to make something of value and succeed. It's part _doing_ it better than the next guy and _wanting_ it more than the next guy.",1173803662

3901,comment,3891,3891,0,0,pg,,,"Going back to school is not identical with giving up. Some founders go back to school and keep working on the startup while there.  However, those do so much worse than the people who work on the startup full-time that going back to school seems, in practice, not too far removed from a death sentence for a startup.<p>Off the top of my head, I'd guess we've had about 8 startups where the founders went back to school.  It doesn't only happen with summer batches.  Founders from winter batches do it too.<p>Usually the reason is that the startup isn't doing very well. However, that judgement depends a lot on how determined the founders are.  One reason we now shy away from funding people still in school is that they often unconsciously want the startup to fail, because the idea of dropping out frightens them.<p>A lot of startups look bad after 3 months.  Someone who's out of school and has to make it work or get a job in a cubicle will say ""don't worry, we'll figure out how to make it successful.""",1173803146

3899,comment,3820,3886,0,0,pg,,,"We already do this.  We actively introduce new founders to ""alumni"" that can help them.  There are now a lot of them. At the first dinner, instead of having an outside expert speak, we invite all the alumni.  This time there were more speakers than audience at that dinner.  <p>The peer-to-peer aspect of YC already scales.  The hard part to scale is what we partners do.",1173802634
3898,comment,3890,3890,0,0,immad,,,"hmm, but the Big Four are like advertiser aggregators (probably a real term for that, reselllers?) since they resell the advertising. So this doesn't seem that surprising to me, the people it affects are other people providing a similar service as a startup. Or am I missing the point?",1173802444

There are a few firms on it that I haven't met partners from personally, and quite a lot of partners I know who didn't make the list.

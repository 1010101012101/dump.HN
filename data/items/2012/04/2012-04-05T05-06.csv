The only reason I did it was because I didn't know how to customize the ad units to match the rest of the page like the previous owner had, so I just left them with the standard white background that made them look terrible. I kept meaning to figure out how to fix it but after about a month I noticed the huge spike in revenue and left it. The gains have stood for several years.<p>Conclusion: Ugly ads that catch your attention have a far superior CTR.<p>Here is the site: <a href=""http://www.starbuckslocations.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.starbuckslocations.com</a>",1333605510

The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as, effectively, a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines.[8][14] The passage of civil aircraft between the Mediterranean and Black Seas is permitted, but only along routes authorised by the Turkish government.[15]</i><p>When I sailed through the Bosphorous, we had a tour guide who told us that once a Soviet sub was spotted outside of the black sea and later spotted inside but notice had never been given and the sub had never been seen going through. They later figured out that the sub had made the journey by shadowing underneath a large civilian ship to prevent from being spotted (by sonar I suppose). After that, they decided to run chains across the straight underneath the depth of a normal ship.<p>I'm not sure how true it is, but it makes a good story. :-)",1333605138

The same cannot be said of Amazon; it regularly sells to hundreds, possibly thousands of (insert state here) customers <i>each day</i>.  This is more than sufficient to establish a sufficient nexus to Colorado so as to justify the imposition of a sales tax.<p>Note that if you read the decision, the key issue is not whether a state can impose a sales tax on out-of-state retailers (it cannot, even without physical presence, if the substantial nexus test is met), but whether the state law unfairly discriminated against out-of-state retailers (which it does, the law is poorly written).<p>The reason Amazon folded against New York and California is because it knew both states were willing to take this all the way to the Supreme Court, and it knew that if that happened, it would lose.",1333604968

The central problem is the hardest possible problem, IMHO; my suggestions are just what we <i>can</i> do about it.<p><i>how can we minimize the overall complexity of a system?</i><p>Nice clear statement. If we're minimizing complexity of an overall system that includes A and B, it doesn't matter whether A and B are distinct programs. OTOH, if we exclude one from the system, we can't measure complexity effectively - unless we're comparing code that uses the same environment e.g. A vs. A', and B is a library.<p>If MS provides an extensive framework, that doesn't quite suit your project, you may distort your project (i.e. add unnecessary complexity)  to take advantage of it.<p>I'm still not fully clear on your question/purpose (though <i>minimize overall complexity</i> seems close). You want something you can use as a guiding value/principle for your company; also something practical. ""<i>Do you accept that minimizing complexity is critical...</i>"" Critical, for what?

Your talk is an advertisement for your work, not the work itself. Your only goal is to convince people to read your paper. Once you realize that this is what you're doing, you can derive several more specific rules like ""not too much math"", ""skip the details"", ""visual slides are better"", ""make sure there's enough motivation for them to care"", ""make sure non-experts can follow along"", etc. As an advertiser, you are fighting for people's attention, not their full acceptance (yet).<p>2. Most people respond best to (and remember) stories, so make your talk into a <i>linear</i> story. From this, you get rules like ""every slide should follow logically from the previous"", ""there should be a strong motivation for why you're doing something"", ""omit boring stuff"", ""punchlines and surprise can really help if used well"", ""building suspense is also useful for some talks"", etc. Note that the traditional ""here are 3 ways our method is better than previous methods"" is definitely <i>not</i> a story.",1333602570

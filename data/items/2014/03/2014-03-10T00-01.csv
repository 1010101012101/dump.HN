7370736,comment,7370586,7370586,12,0,hawkharris,,,"This reminds me of a story I heard from a professor while I was studying public relations.<p>In her early career, my professor was a lobbyist faced with a seemingly impossible task: getting Republicans and Democrats to agree on a healthcare initiative. The nonprofit foundation that employed her wanted Congress to help provide care to more Americans who couldn&#x27;t afford it. (This is unrelated to the more recent Affordable Care Act.)<p>Here&#x27;s the interesting part: my professor didn&#x27;t just start speaking with politicians. She interviewed and distributed a survey to congresspeople and their aids. The goal was to better understand what phrases attracted or turned off Democrats and Republicans, respectively.<p>She learned that, when it came to bridging gaps between people, both parties wanted similar things — but they discussed the issues in dramatically different ways. Democrats frequently used the word &quot;inequality&quot; and phrases like &quot;leveling the playing field.&quot; Meanwhile, Republicans preferred phrases like &quot;raising the bottom,&quot; the notion being that natural economic disparities exist among different groups.<p>Researching the parties&#x27; preferences and crafting different messages, my professor succeeded in passing the initiative.<p>The takeaway is that if you&#x27;re trying mobilize people around this topic, be very cautious about the language you choose, especially the word &quot;inequality.&quot; Liberals and conservatives both want to help disenfranchised people, but, at least among those with political power, language can be the dividing line.",1394413177

There have been layoffs after layoffs in chemistry, pharmacology and biotech, math isn&#x27;t the dream ticket to Wall Street any longer - in fact the only areas with job openings are computer science and petroleum engineering.  Computer science is growing because investment there increases workers&#x27; productivity, and the jobs in petroleum are there because of domestic gas production.

7370710,comment,7369842,7369842,9,0,jballanc,,,"Given HN&#x27;s recent obsession with Bitcoins, it&#x27;s probably worth noting that the &quot;double-spend&quot; problem is a variation on the Two Generals problem (or, more accurately, the Byzantine Generals problem). Regardless of your views on Bitcoin as a currency replacement, it&#x27;s hard to deny that the block chain is a rather clever solution to this problem.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not exactly a <i>breakthrough</i> solution. As noted in the article, it is possible to increase the confidence of coordination at the expense of speed and resources. In this case, requiring the &quot;commander&quot; to commit limited resources (computational power to generate hashes) and a majority of the &quot;lieutenants&quot; to agree on one commander&#x27;s solution, then chaining multiple decision events together, the result is actually fairly robust.<p>Obviously, for most use cases something like the block chain is completely impractical.

Then somebody could start monitoring the telemetry from the the one (or five, or some other low number of planes) that were in trouble of some sort.<p>It would also be quite simple to be running a bunch of automated tests on the telemetry from every plane in the sky and flagging anything out of spec. AF447 fell into the ocean. It&#x27;s pretty fucking simple for a computer to monitor the altitude of a plane and say &quot;one of your planes has significantly deviated from it&#x27;s target altitude&quot;.<p>And &quot;highly unlikely they would have been able to identify the cause&quot; seems highly unlikely.

Oh, sure, some places do, but they&#x27;re very, very few; I suspect it&#x27;s pretty much impossible in any area where you expect to grow, simply because finding people who know it already is nearly impossible, and learning it is difficult, especially as your established crew learns new and more powerful abstractions; the amount of learning required to get someone up to speed gets higher and higher, which is not what you want as you expand.<p>But that said, as a developer even in more approachable languages, learning that cleverness has its benefits. It provides new insights into ways problems can be expressed. Most developers agree on the benefits of learning a new language; you learn a few good ideas, a few paradigms and approaches, that can carry over and affect the way you code in your day to day. Haskell, with its depth, is better still; you have a seemingly neverending set of ideas to learn and draw from. Many, yes, are too clever to see a full implementation elsewhere in production code that has many maintainers.

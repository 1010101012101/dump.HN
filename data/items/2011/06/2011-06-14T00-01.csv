If not, what are you 'modeling'?  In 'science', a model is considered useful in how well it predicts the observations of some experiment, especially experiments on effects which were not known when the model was created.  What do your bragged about models predict?  What are they good for besides talking about with other quants?",1308013084

Of course I believe that Western countries are less repressive than the likes of North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, etc.<p>The internet offers people an unprecendented ability to communicate with each other. This is causing big social changes, and big social changes always create winners and losers, so that some people who are currently powerful, but who these changes will make less powerful. For example, repressive regimes, or the copyright industry.<p>The attitude of the USA and other Western countries is inconsistent. They welcome the changes the internet is bringing when it hurts incumbents they don't like (e.g. repressive regimes except those ones allied to the West), and want to stop they changes when it hurts incumbents they like (e.g. major political donors such as the MAFIAA).<p>So on the one hand they're trying to make the internet more locked-down, and on the other hand they're trying to make it more free. It's obvious that they won't succeed in doing both, and it's also obvious that they are going to be more successful at doing anything if they have a clear goal of what they want to achieve.<p>My view is that the national interests of Western countries lie in making the internet as free as possible. Yes there will be costs -- e.g. Wikileaks will embarrass Western leaders from time to time, and file sharing will hurt political donors. But these are harms to the leaders of Western countries, not to their populations.",1308013077

Sure, on one Groupon promotion a few unused coupons can mitigate losses on the deal overall, but make no mistake about it- businesses use Groupon because it is a cool, hot, marketing play that allows them to be lazy and bring in a ton of foot traffic.<p>The root of the problem, and the reason Groupon's model is unsustainablem, is that most of these businesses are not producing a product that is different or so unbelievably valuable that people are going to continue to come in and buy it at a price that is profitable in the long run. People go to a coffee shop because it is close and convenient. All coffee shops serve a commodity that is in a price range that varies by only a few cents. Their only way to differentiate is with location. Period. With restaurants it's a little different because food costs and quality vary a bit more, but I still maintain that the only people who regularly buy Groupons are deal-hunting cheapskates who won't be back regularly.

We all prefer the quick wins to the bigger wins that can be achieved by deferring immediate gratification. (There's a relatively famous study which shows that unattended children will often eat a cookie even when they know they will get two cookies if they leave the cookie alone until the researcher returns in a few minutes.)<p>So I guess it's important that we realise that this is a deep problem and think about what (if anything) could be done to solve it. I suspect that it's actually near-impossible to change the behaviour of powerful individuals within an organisation in any meaningful way, and that having an external entity usurp the established order is about the best solution that can be achieved. (I assert that this is true on an individual level within organisations and also when considering organisations as a whole.)<p>It may turn out that this is (in general) a more efficient way to seek global maxima than to wait for a particular entity to alter its behaviour.

Columns have a long history (newspapers come to mind) that does not seem to be tied to single page layout.<p>The most important thing that columns preserve is readable line lengths. If you want to maintain good, readable line lengths on the web, you are going to end up with a relatively thin column and a lot of scrolling. Multiple columns allow us to more efficiently use the visible on screen space while maintaining readability. That seems pretty valuable to me.",1308011546

I entered the workforce expecting to learn how to be a better programmer from my more experienced co-workers. It was a bit traumatic to realize that they didn't even understand basic things like why using a hashmap is better than a nested for-loop or why one of the basic OOP principles is ""favor composition over inheritance.""<p>Since you mention data so much, I am curious, have you ever read ""Fool of Randomness"" by Nassim Taleb?",1308010262

Certainly one can find what looks like evidence to the contrary by cherry-picking - just find specific places where specific types of weather extremes happened to get ""more extreme"" over the period for which you've got good data, then write an article like the one you link to. Ask yourself this: If they had looked at some different region and found it to have a trend towards <i>less</i> extreme weather or to have no trend at all, would this finding have been publishable? Could they have gotten press for saying ""we looked at all the natural causes we could think of, ruled them out, and are forced to conclude that AGW made for <i>less</i> extreme weather in (area X)""? If not, there's a publication bias such that we'd see regular ""it's getting worse"" articles even if it were not, in fact, getting worse.",1308009937

<a href=""http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/28/a-sequential-actor-like-api-for-server-side-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/28/a-sequential-actor-like-ap...</a><p>By ""actor-like way"" here I just mean a code module (""actor"") sees one thread (at a time), and the runtime takes care of the details of scheduling threads when a module has an event/message/request to process. Also I guess avoiding callbacks. But you could be more Erlang-ish/Akka-ish in more details if you wanted.<p>node.js punts this to the app developer to instead run a herd of processes. In most cases that's probably fine, but in theory with one process and many threads, the runtime can do a better job saturating the CPU cores because it can move actors among the threads rather than waiting for the single-threaded process an actor happens to be in to become free. The practical situations where this comes up, I admit, are probably not that numerous as long as you never use blocking IO and are basically IO-bound. (Only CPU-intensive stuff would cause a problem.)<p>btw this has been hashed out to death on the node.js list:

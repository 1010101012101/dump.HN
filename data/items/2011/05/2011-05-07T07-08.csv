There are a number of very good colleges up there in the form of RIT, U of R, Syracuse U, a ton of SUNY's[1] and others.<p>Paychex and Kodak were founded in the Rochester area, for example. So its not like you're guaranteed to be in a desolate rural void just because you're in upstate NY.<p>What would you focus on if you were to go back (note: not what would you major in, but, what would you spend your time doing?)<p>1.

We are used to 7-digit numbers, since that is the limit what a human can easily remember; but there is no reason why phone numbers can't have any number of digits.<p>In the days of analogue telephony the order of the numbers dialed was important, as the switches used them to narrow down to the actual recipient of the call; but today they're more like URLs, where the whole sequence is taken into consideration. So, while once it was impossible to have numbers 1234 and 12345 in the same area code -- and when they were expanding everyone switched at the same time; I remember that vividly when my hometown switched from 6 to 7 digits some thirty years ago -- today you may have them, and even 1234567 or 1234567890123456789012345677.<p>I honestly expect that no not so far away future we will ditch phone numbers completely, and instead the phones will be just another technical details we don't bother to remember or even think of, like currently the IP address.",1304753644

I'm thinking the exploit is unescaped HTML/Javascript, combined with the ability to launch local code.<p>If you read the original post from the hack team in question, they stated the ability to at least get a local shell running as a result, so either there's something resulting in launching local file content (like an interpreter, then passing commands to it) or something able to crash Skype in an interesting and controllable way.<p>Given that the original authors also stated that when he tested this on his GF, she was unable to use Skype for awhile - I have a feeling it's chat related, was stored in the client chat logs, and was re-launching / re-executing whenever Skype was being opened.",1304753643

But the most popular guide for the revolutionaries was a document that spread throughout the soccer clubs in Egypt, which themselves were the most significant revolutionary community groups. If you read this document, you see that on the first page it says to be careful not to use Twitter and Facebook as they are being monitored. On the last page: do not use Twitter or Facebook.

In that case display:table-* will give you the same layout (neither worse nor better!) but without requiring any specific markup in the html.<p>But this poses a dilemma for web developers, because display:table-* is not supported by all browsers, so some specifc kinds of layout can <i>only</i> be achieved with table markup.<p>Developers had to choose between (1) compromising the layout (2) compromising the semantic/style separation or (3) use complex workaround like the CSS frameworks, which tried to emulate the table-layout model without requiring display:table support in the browser. Neither is optimal.",1304751736

8410460,comment,8409969,8410194,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yes, but when someone says they recently came from Liberia, and he outbreak is centered in Liberia, that <i>is</i> something out of the ordinary. I don&#x27;t expect people to have all knowledge about the management of the disease at their fingertips, but yes I do expect them to be aware of it as a potential danger, in the same way they need to be aware of things like Enterovirus D68 and the current measles outbreak, to name but two. That might simply mean asking the patient to wait while spending a few minutes looking up procedures and arranging for an unusual blood test to be performed (which was apparently done last instead of first: <a href=""http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141003-ebola-case-blood-test-delay-may-have-violated-federal-guidelines.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141003-ebola-case-blo...</a>)<p>What is the point of the CDC sending out bulletins on things to watch out for if the people with the relevant clinical and administrative expertise don&#x27;t pay attention to them? I&#x27;m sorry, I am not buying the idea that having greater domain knowledge is an excuse for being <i>less</i> aware of a major risk factor that has been a headline news story for <i>months</i>.<p>While it&#x27;s true that Ebola has only affected a few thousand people so far, it&#x27;s also true that it&#x27;s led to the collapse of public health systems in several developing countries, and is threatening the ability of the countries themselves to function. It&#x27;s fairly fast acting, fairly easily communicable, and kills 60-70% of patients. It seems to me that staying abreast of emergent public health issues is a significant part of <i>what people are paid for</i>. Again, not necessarily knowing in advance what to do about every situation, but the ability to recognize a potentially dangerous situation as something out of the ordinary.",1412452791

But I would expect that a single shot of a rifle is quite difficult to pinpoint, <i>especially</i> in an urban setting. There are audio gunfire locators that some cities have, but even then, the assassin can be long gone by the time anyone could respond. Just drive a car into a nearby parking garage, do the thing, and leave. For a drone operation, the setup and &quot;mission&quot; time is almost certainly much longer. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere near fully autonomous missions that could assassinate with any appreciable reliability, so you&#x27;re going to need to fly line of sight (very impractical because of the range) or FPV (still impractical because of the required skill, equipment and mission time).<p>Could a professional band of assassins pull off an assassination with a drone? Certainly. Would it be <i>far</i> easier to just use a rifle? I&#x27;d say absolutely.",1412452751

Entire shows and channels are based on our ability to prepare meat in delicious ways. Hell, I live in Texas, and one of the many things people think of when they think of the state is our BBQ.<p>In this kind of culture it is inevitable that many people will go through their lives without for a second even considering what it would seem is an important ethical issue.

Basically, a TP generates types at compile time, in a way that actually plays quite nicely with IntelliSense [1]. In the case of db TPs, they&#x27;re parameterized by a connection string and connect to the db to extract the schema and generate the appropriate types. Several exist [2]; SqlDataConnection and SqlEntityConnection are built-in, FSharp.Data.SqlClient and FSharp.Data.SqlProvider are community contributed. They all use query expressions (basically, F#&#x27;s extensible version of LINQ syntax) except SqlClient which directly uses SQL in a string (but still checks the query at compile time and passes arguments cleanly, thanks to the TP) and is therefore more like a (safer) micro-ORM.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156509.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156509.aspx</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://fsharp.org/guides/data-access/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharp.org/guides/data-access/</a>",1412451978

To do otherwise is to take advantage (might makes right), and that notion is disturbing.<p>In those terms, I have a very hard time justifying raising, keeping, and killing (and in most cases causing incredible suffering) to animals purely for our pleasure, when it is both entirely possible and likely more efficient for us to not eat them.<p>Basically, the only reason we eat animals today is because we&#x27;ve always done things this way.

In both cases an argument for teaching it is that it exercises the mind, developing a sense of abstraction in the case of algebra, and imagination and empathy in the case of literature, I would argue.

After kicking ass for two out of three months of contract-to-hire gig, the company said they loved my work and wanted to end the contract early. Awesome. Then they dropped a full time offer for 20% less than the minimum they advertised on Angelist, well below the market. When I tried to negotiate towards something more reasonable, they pulled that same line about the range being for a very senior dev and were resistant to negotiation, even though the advertised range is big enough to fly a jetliner through and they clearly know that no self-respecting senior dev would work for the bottom half of the advertised range. They just closed a huge round and could have paid more, but chose not to.<p>I ultimately declined their final offer which they seemed pretty surprised by. It&#x27;s hard not to take personally after working there and proving my value for two months. Instead of a bum offer from a company I just met, which is no big deal, it really felt like people I thought were my friends were trying to take advantage of the situation.  I probably will never do another contract-to-hire.

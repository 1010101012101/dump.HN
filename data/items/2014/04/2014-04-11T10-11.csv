That said, the waste is easier to handle for several reasons, particularly in the liquid fuel type.<p>The waste in conventional reactors are of two types, fission procucts and higher actinides. The fision products are the result of splitted uranium atoms. These are intensively radioactive, with halflives from milliseconds to about 30 years.<p>Then there are higher actinides, with halflives up to tens of thousands of years. These are less radioactive, but still radioactive enough that they have to be safely stored. This storage must be safe for hundred of thousands of years, something that it is hard to guarantee. Fision products only need to be stored for about 600-800 years before they are no more radioactive than uranium ore. Thorium rectors produce virtually no higher actinides, so it is easier to find storage that is safe for the period it must stay out of reach. It is also less volume of the waste (but more concentrated, as the amount of radioactivity is about the same), since the fission products are not mixed with U238 as in conventional reactors. This means that less storage is needed, which also makes it easier to handle.",1397212462

On top of that, what advantage would there be in having multiple package managers? All you&#x27;re doing is making the package management harder by splitting it up.  How would I indicate my Nuget package depends on a specific version of jQuery?<p>The line is simple to draw: Nuget should never install anything. It&#x27;s not chocolatey or aptitude. It provides versioned files, no more. That is its focus, and should remain it, no matter what those files contain.<p>DLLs are dominant, but definitely not the only type of dependency. Dependencies on text files, javascript, or just about anything else need to be versionable using the same system.  If not, you would run into the issues mentioned above.<p>Multiple projects with different version dependencies might usually be a bad idea, but it&#x27;s still something you need to support. Unlike some other systems, Nuget can&#x27;t be opinionated about how you manage your projects. If it was, it would be dropped like a rock by enterprises that don&#x27;t want to adapt to the package manager of choice. If that makes it harder to do something the platform does for you, nobody really loses.<p>Package restore is more fragile than local assemblies, yes. We&#x27;ve seen that a few times lately when Nuget was down. These are risks that can be mitigated though, by providing mirrors and a decent local cache.<p>Putting any sort of binary dependency in a version control system is a problem.  They can&#x27;t be compared to previous versions. Unless you make folders for each version of the package you depend on, you also can&#x27;t depend on different versions in your projects. And worst of all, if a dev decides to replace a package, it could break something else.  Those (and others) are exactly the reasons package managers were created in the first place.",1397212317

Was it really that simple?<p>Close enough.<p>> The heart beat request sends the text as well as the length it wants back?<p>The heartbeat sends a payload prefixed by its size. That&#x27;s perfectly normal design (for variable-size payloads), that way the handler reads the size, allocates a buffer[-1] and uses read(2) to read the payload into the buffer. Otherwise the handler would have to &quot;guess&quot; the payload size, and that never ends well.<p>The problem here is twofold:<p>1. read(2) may read less than requested, if an attacker gave a bigger size than the actual one for instance. That&#x27;s why read(2) returns the number of bytes actually read<p>2. malloc(3) hands out a bunch of memory, without clearing it[0]. Depending on the exact allocator and application runtime, chances are this bit of memory is at least in part freed memory, which is filled with the content of previous allocations such as SSH keys or passwords or whatever<p>(2.) is compounded by OpenSSL having its own freelists on top of malloc which it does not clear, making it <i>certain</i> to hit previously allocated data<p>You&#x27;re supposed to check the result of read(2) and adjust your payload size and only copy <i>that</i> to the output buffer. Or just error out if the sizes differ.<p>And ideally unless you have very specific reasons not to you&#x27;d want to use calloc(3), so that if you forget to check read(2) you return zeroed memory anyway. The first part was forgotten and the second one not done (because &quot;needs fasts!&quot;), the whole input buffer was copied in the output buffer and an attacker gets 64kb[1] worth of previous allocations data.<p>[-1] possibly adding its own constraints on top of that, here the payload&#x27;s 64KiB so it&#x27;s not relevant, in other contexts the server could refuse overly large payloads<p>[0] except on BSD with a malloc.conf using the J or Z options<p>[1] because the user-provided length is a 16 bit uint",1397211734

It&#x27;s not just local file access, which becomes a security hole when you let users pass you XML files, though that is one of the worst ones.<p>But the number of times I&#x27;ve seen production apps that turn out to behind the scenes request DTD&#x27;s or schemas from remote servers regularly have made that one of the first thing I check if I am tasked to maintain or look into anything that parses XML. Often these apps stop working or slow down for seemingly no reason because the DTD or schema becomes unavailable, and nobody understands why.",1397210848

7572052,comment,7561973,7570552,1,0,NateDad,,,"> In what way?<p>In the ways I described below that line :)<p>> It&#x27;s certainly not simple to set up! Most languages, I can put my projects wherever I want. It took me a while to find out that I had to put my projects in my Gopath for them to properly compile with third party libraries. There are lots of weird restrictions like that.<p>Python, C, and C++ all have magic directories just like that. For ex /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/<p>At least Go lets you define where to put it yourself, and the paths are just the URL for the VCS.<p>> Goroutine capture is by reference, which is why a lot of new people have trouble with goroutines in for loops.<p>I think you&#x27;re talking about what happens when you run <i>closures</i> as goroutines in a loop, like this: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/1NX39zk4NI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/1NX39zk4NI</a><p>This is just a misunderstanding of how closures work and what it means to start a goroutine.  Yes, closures capture the variables so that modifications inside the closure and outside the closure both affect each other, that&#x27;s the whole point of closures.  Goroutines, when started, may not start right away, and actually generally don&#x27;t, certainly not faster than this loop can run.<p>> Go, like most imperative languages, can suffer from global variable overload. Lots of Go code is also so badly typed that it&#x27;s impossible to tell what things are supposed to be. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen `x := poorlyNamedFunctionWTFIsThis()` or `foo(x {}interface){... x.bar()}`<p>You can write bad code in any language.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an indictment of go.<p>> There are `panic()`s.<p>Panic is intentionally clumsy and is actively discouraged.  Any package that panics as a form of replacement for exceptions will basically never get used by the community.  That&#x27;s a big difference from other major languages that use exceptions for error propagation and control flow.<p>> Rust also doesn&#x27;t even have null pointers at all, at least in `safe` code blocks. Rust uses `Option` instead.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read this is actually just inferior to Go&#x27;s multiple returns, because options don&#x27;t tell you <i>why</i> they failed, unless you use multiple returns, in which case it&#x27;s basically exactly like Go.<p>Go:<p><pre><code>  val, err := foo()\n  if err != nil {\n      return err\n  }\n</code></pre>\nRust:<p><pre><code>  let (opt, err) = foo()\n  match (opt) {\n      (None) => return err \n  }\n</code></pre>\nIs that really any better? In Rust you have to know what match does, what this magic (None) => business is... whereas the Go code just reads like normal C-ish code.  Anyone who&#x27;s ever taken intro to programming would be able to tell you what the Go code does.  To understand the Rust code, you have to know a lot of the language internals.  And that&#x27;s exactly what I mean about Go code being simple and easy to understand.<p>> a lot of modern languages have [concurrency] primitives like this.<p>Not any of the mainstream languages. C, C++, Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Javascript .... some of them can do similar things, but it takes a lot more boilerplate and it&#x27;s a lot uglier and harder to reason about.<p>[Edited for clarity]",1397210820

953261,comment,952290,952290,0,0,dasil003,,,"This article seems to stem from the ridiculous premise that <i>the</i> open source question is whether a software company should take their core product and simply open source it.  It's no wonder a lot of software companies balk at the thought.  It's ridiculous.<p>The issue of open source is about value, not cash.  With open source a lot more value is created because more users and more developers means better quality.  This extra value can translate into a winning scenario for a software company open sourcing some of their components, because they get more robust software essentially for free.<p>The trick is to release components that have broad use cases, ie. the stuff that's ripe for commodification anyway.  Thinking that stuff gives you a competitive advantage is fool-hardy because by definition, there are always going to be more developers outside your organization than in it, so anything that's broadly useful is going to be done better by open source than your company will be able to manage, so why not proactively take control of the situation and build your own open source community.<p>But there's no value in releasing your own secret sauce.  Companies like Google and Facebook inherently understand that which is why they release things like GWT and Cassandra without a second thought.  Yes it's serious software that contributes to their competitive advantage, but it doesn't give anybody a jump start on eating their lunch.",1258747196

Just like you shouldn't write code that takes as input other code and blindly runs it on the server; or serves any file on the server without any sort of checks. Using prepared statements, or if you can't, at least manually escaping user data, is part of writing functional code. A program that does not do this is not functional and as much as writing down an example that shows how to do it breeds bad code.",1258746746

953223,comment,952331,952544,0,0,rcoder,,,"When I worked on a sizable JRuby/Rails codebase, our team had a hybrid approach: ephemeral jobs (rake tasks, migrations, autospec) all ran under MRI, while long-lived processes (app servers, CI/acceptance test runs) ran in JRuby. That gave us the best of both worlds: quick startup in cases where total runtime was an issue, and better throughput (and more predictable memory usage) for CPU-heavy workloads.<p>In my experience, MRI/REE fits into smaller RAM footprints only in cases where either you start up and shut down runtimes relatively regularly, or you can monitor for runaway leaks and terminate bloated processes.<p>I do agree that switching to a different runtime just to get  access to a few libraries is probably the wrong approach, however. The big wins in using JRuby are, to me, twofold: a nice performance boost for general application code, and the availability of robust, battle-tested application servers. Mongrel, Unicorn, and Passenger are fine if you're willing to live on the edge, but if you have a more conservative ops team, or simply don't want to both with rolling your own monitoring and deployment stack, being able to drop a Rails app onto Tomcat or Glassfish as a single WAR file is pretty damn nice.",1258746705

The biggest contributor to my particular case seems to be independent finger movement. So switching to hunt and peck allows my entire hand to stay fairly relaxed and minimizes wrist tension. (I can also wear wrist braces this way.) That, combined with a keyboard with extremely light action, has been what's worked best for me thus far. Occasionally I break out one of my several Kenisis or other ergonomic keyboards and try going back to dvorak, but it always gets worse.<p>EDIT: I can't seem to reply to your question, so I'll add here. RSI can sneak up on you before you notice symptoms, and the symptoms can take years to appear.

So are water\n    vapor (the source of 90% of earth's natural greenhouse effect),\n    methane, and other gases. The natural carbon dioxide content of the\n    atmosphere has doubled in the last 200 years, climate is getting\n    warmer, so the logical conclusion is that there is a connection\n    between the two trends. If you feel uncomfortably warm at night and\n    wake up to find someone has put another blanket over you, you don't\n    need to look beyond that to identify the source of the warming.\n\n    * Nobody - nobody - argues with the carbon dioxide trend. It's\n    established beyond doubt.\n\n    * The debate over whether climate is getting warmer is mostly over.\n\n    * The debate now is over whether the connection between warming and\n    human emission of carbon dioxide is real, or whether there are other\n    causes of climate change at work.\n\n    * The real issue is whether the benefits of taking action will\n    outweigh the costs and regulatory burdens.\n\n    * There are some who argue that warming will be beneficial by\n    reducing energy demands for heating, lengthening growing seasons,\n    and creating larger habitable and arable territory.\n\n    The case for human-caused global warming is simultaneously a lot\n    clearer than George W. Bush believes, and a whole lot less so than\n    Al Gore does. There are legitimate questions about the data, past\n    climate reconstructions, and the computer modeling still to be\n    answered.</code></pre>",1258744542

Both have made valuable contributions to the science surrounding this issue, McIntyre by spotting actual flaws within datasets and Watts by driving the effort to catalogue and categorise the quality of the all-important weather stations. They're not demagogues throwing around baseless accusations who should be ignored.<p>McIntyre is the main target of the Hadley Centre scientists' ire, which I suspect has more to do with the fact that he's actually competent and knows how to interpret the data they release, something they oddly seem to fear.<p>Lest we forget, scientists like those at the Hadley Centre have their own incentives, as their funding is directly correlated to the prevailing fear of global warming.

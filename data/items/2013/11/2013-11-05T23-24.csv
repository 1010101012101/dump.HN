Good for Google. It is more than what Oracle or Microsoft or others do.<p>My opinion is this -- JS is a shitty language. It was a shitty language, no matter how many &quot;good parts&quot; books will be published or how many frameworks one builds on top of it -- it is still an ugly language that makes me want to tear my hair out every time I use it. You love it, great. I hate it.  I was hoping from day one someone, some company, would find a good replacement. I can tolerate compiling to it and treating it like assembler. It is even better if it gets bypassed altogether.<p>There were other posts here about JS&#x27;s warts, so I am not the only one who welcome any other sane, normal, language to replace it.<p>Anyway, great work Google, keep releasing new versions of Dart, Dart UI, Dart IDE and so on.",1383695757

6679378,comment,6667592,6668105,3,0,gnuarm,,,"The GA144 gets its efficiency from the fact that everything about the design is simple and it uses very few transistors.  How many transistors in an A9?  The async nature of the GA144 processors saves power if they are stalled, waiting for something to happen.  But if they are in a spin loop doing timing, they are as inefficient as any other MCU.  The static power is very low because they aren&#x27;t using state of the art, low voltage processes with leaky transistors.  With Vcc at 1.8 V the transistors can turn on and off hard.<p>I think it is a mistake to compare the GA144 to an ARM.  They are not really designed for the same sorts of tasks.  There are big ARMs for large memory apps which the GA144 is entirely unsuited to and there are small ARMs with more limited memory that have no where near the power of the GA144.  But then the GA144 with all processors running flat out uses power like the big ARM... so where is the right comparison?<p>I compare the GA144 to FPGAs.  The GA144 has an array of very small processors with <i>very</i> limited memory.  But they can be viewed as very beefy logic blocks that execute sequentially rather than parallel logic.  To use the GA144 for something useful you need to design your app to suit.  Thinking of it as a standard CPU won&#x27;t get you very far.<p>You won&#x27;t be running a useful version of Linux on the GA144 and it is too expensive to suit toaster type apps.  But it might be the right device for any number of embedded apps that need raw performance like hearing aids or other signal processing apps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the GA144 would be great at.  I can find a few apps it would be good for such as a small analog I/O board I currently build and need to respin because the FPGA is EOL.  But I&#x27;m not sure I would ever use the GA144 for this product because it may go EOL at any time depending on the company.  They are very small and I see no sign they are getting bigger.

It was an unfinished idea and just a hint at the potential behind the creator&#x27;s own idea. I think the problem you mentioned can be solved by putting the sand into a transparent hood ontop of a very thin plate made which all is made out of this meta-material: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmEE-2aJkeo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmEE-2aJkeo</a><p>That meta-material allows sound to pass through, which is perfect to reduce a loss of sensitivity in the visualization. Also you could use something other than sand, that reacts much more intense to any kind of resonance frequency. My idea would be to create lots of fullerenes, each containing elements with different resonance frequencies, mix them up and put them into a closed cage made out of that meta-material. Should be amazing to watch the material form shapes out of your brain waves.<p>(stumbled over this article, while researching for the material <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/421285/mass-can-be-created-inside-graphene-say-physicists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/421285/mass-can-be-crea...</a> maybe of interest)",1383694333

6679230,comment,6678023,6678886,5,0,pron,,,"> How so? Can you explain how you think Scala isn&#x27;t sound/typesafe?<p>Because you can do casts, and it&#x27;s not pure. It doesn&#x27;t even enforce immutability. You know what? Forget about enforcing  it doesn&#x27;t even make mutability or casts hard. 
Look, Haskell is certainly not my cup of tea. Personally, I don&#x27;t think the effort of thinking about my program twice (once in terms of logic and once in terms of types) is worth it in most circumstances, and pure functional languages don&#x27;t support concurrent data structures which is what I deal with the most. But I do recognize Haskell&#x27;s elegance, and if the elaborate type system is worth it, it&#x27;s only because it can enforce many guarantees. I mean, the whole point of Haskell is that it supposedly makes safer programs. So you pay for the elaborate types (though some consider it a plus), but you gain safety. With Scala you just pay.<p>> Uhm, can you explain to me an example of a simple OO type system that is &#x27;just powerful enough&#x27;?<p>Sure. C++, Java, C#. Almost all of the world&#x27;s software is written in C++ or Java. The question is not which language has &quot;the best type system&quot; (and even if it were, Scala can&#x27;t make up its mind because it&#x27;s got three of them). A type system is not an end but a means. Practically everyone who deals with type systems agrees that they come at a cost (and Martin Odersky himself admitted as much). But the cost hopefully buys you something. It arguably buys you better design, and it definitely buys you safety. Well, Scala doesn&#x27;t give you safety any more than C++ or Java, and as for design, it can&#x27;t even pick one type system; a cornerstone of great design is that you have to make hard choices.",1383693679

The tennis example given in the article isn&#x27;t a good one, because the point system used to determine rankings is somewhat arbitrary. I wrote about this a little more in depth [2] while I was developing a free android app to bring elo ratings to any multiplayer game [3].<p>If we are going to stick with the title of World Champion, I believe the best way to go about it is an annual double round robin tournament featuring the 10 highest rated players. Each player plays every other player twice, once with black, once with white, and the player with the most points (win = 1 point, draw = .5 points, loss = 0 points) wins.<p>The problem with having candidates matches--or really any qualifying tournaments--is that it heavily favors the current champion. Even a player as strong as Carlsen probably has a < 50% chance of winning a tournament(s)/series of matches against other top ranked players. This means that the top rated player may have a cumulative probability of <10% of gaining the title, while the current champion, even if ranked eighth like Anand currently is, could have a 40-50% chance of retaining the title.<p>This is why the title of World Champion should be based off a round robin tournament of all the top players. Chess already has a robust, accurate, and thoroughly tested and revised rating system. We ought to make more use of it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating</a>

If A regularly beats B, and B regularly beats C, it does not mean that A will regularly beat C. This is where matches are flawed--one player could have a particular weakness against the other and lose a match to him, while still being the strongest player in the world, as measured by his results against all the other top players (which is what the elo rating does).",1383692748

Not sure how one language that compiles to JS is more &quot;cheerful&quot; than an other, but we&#x27;re really a cheerful bunch in person. I&#x27;m sure you could have a beer with us if you&#x27;d like :)<p>As to the your and the OP&#x27;s point about Dart being another CoffeeScript, this is really far from reality. CoffeeScript is just syntax changes, and that&#x27;s not sufficient for fixing JavaScript major problems - which come form its semantics, not it&#x27;s syntax.<p>Dart and CoffeeScript are actually quite far apart on the spectrum of compile-to-JS languages: Dart tries to keep a similar syntax and fix the semantics, CoffeeScript tries to keep the semantics and &quot;fix&quot; the syntax (I personally find CoffeeScript very hard to read). Claiming that Dart is another CoffeeScript, to me, shows a real lack of knowledge about one or both of the languages.",1383692510

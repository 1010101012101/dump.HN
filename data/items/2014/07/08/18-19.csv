Education budgets may have been cut over the past few years but in real dollars, they are <i>significantly</i> larger than they were in the &#x27;50s, &#x27;60s, and even the &#x27;90s. So is willingness to spend a problem? Or are we spending on the wrong things?",1404845990

Lots of DSPs try to make it seem simple enough for Joe Businessowner to setup a display campaign, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they should.<p>To go about display buying properly you need:<p>- A decent budget you are ok wasting to collect your initial data set<p>- Proper conversion tracking in place<p>- Ideally an ad server and/or way of measuring the contribution of view through conversions/revenue from a cross-channel attribution standpoint<p>- Display creative, and ideally multiple variations to test<p>- Retargeting tags set to take advantage of various list-based tactics<p>- Etc. Etc. Etc.<p>Some things like an ad server might be ok to do without if you know what you are doing as the DSPs all have their own you can use these days, but it enables things like exposure-to-conversion reporting which is pretty important.<p>Advertising in general is indeed hard and expensive, and all too often I see companies who have tossed thousands upon thousands of dollars (sometimes with several zeros appended) on buys that weren&#x27;t thought out, weren&#x27;t tracked properly, weren&#x27;t managed properly, and that they ultimately deemed failures because they don&#x27;t understand how view-throughs factor into the broader mix.<p>Source: I do this for a living.<p><i>EDIT: Formatting</i>",1404845989

Regardless of the encryption there are many ways to fool you into believing the server you&#x27;re talking to belongs to some other entity, CA&#x27;s were supposed to address that but they are consistently failing at this both by accident and indifference as well as hacking.  These concerns need to be separated.  I believe the end game is for servers to generate their own certificates for encrypted communication, and ultimately it will have to be some extension to DNS to handle the proof of identity, but I don&#x27;t see an obvious evolution from the existing CA system.",1404845660

8006068,comment,8004812,8004812,1,0,IBM,,,"Net neutrality proponents regularly couch their rhetoric in being an issue for the public&#x27;s interest. To me it seems like one industry (tech/web companies) jockeying over another industry (telcos/cable) to accrue the benefits/cost savings to themselves. Start ups and other businesses that exist on the web don&#x27;t like the idea of sponsored data because it could possibly raise their costs of doing business, but it isn&#x27;t something the public should care about and that government should step in to prevent. No one is providing Jolla with protections or subsidies to better compete with Apple or Samsung, but yet the web companies in pushing for net neutrality (and waging a great PR campaign that enlists the greater public to their side) are essentially asking for one. Maybe your music start up will have to pay carriers to better compete with Spotify or Apple, that&#x27;s really your problem and perhaps you&#x27;ll have to suck up the additional operating expense.<p>As for Google, they&#x27;re staying out of this fight not just because they could benefit from sponsored data, but also because they seem intent on getting into the ISP business themselves. They recently added a new executive in charge of &quot;Access and Energy&quot;[0]. This could be their first real business outside of advertising. I think it&#x27;s befitting that a company, that is essentially a utility on the net, is getting into another utility-like business.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/</a>",1404845555

Perhaps a more obvious example would be failing, stateful computation written as follows as an order-free restricted type in Haskell<p><pre><code>    ( MonadPlus , MonadState s ) => m a\n</code></pre>\nGiven some concrete choices of monads to witness those effects like MaybeT and StateT there are two &quot;orders&quot; we can stack them.<p><pre><code>    MaybeT (StateT s Identity) a\n    StateT s (MaybeT Identity) a\n</code></pre>\nwhere Identity forms the &quot;effect free&quot; base of our stack. While functions which operate on types with the order-free signature work for each stack, ultimately the stacks represent different combined effects. In particular, the `StateT s (MaybeT Identity)` stack throws away state if the computation fails while `MaybeT (StateT s Identity)` does not.<p><pre><code>    run1 :: StateT s (MaybeT Identity) a \n         -> s -> Maybe (s, a)\n         -- failure captures the result state\n\n    run2 :: MaybeT (StateT s Identity) a\n         -> s -> (s, Maybe a)\n         -- result state always produced, failure captured\n         -- only in the result value\n</code></pre>\nSo, ultimately the semantics of your effect set depend upon the ordering of your effects.

Then optimal iodepth settings are determined for each workload and block size by running short tests with incrementing iodepth settings (targeted for maximum iops). Once iodepth is determined, 3 iterations of tests are performed, each with 36 workloads (18 block sizes, random + sequential). Each of these is 15 minutes (5 minute ramp_time, 10 minute runtime). Since asynchronous IO and variable iodepth settings were used, latency wasn&#x27;t compared.

And since certificates already have expiration dates and CAs typically don&#x27;t issue certificates for longer than a couple years this should be easy: You don&#x27;t trust any certificate signed by that CA which expires after a date two years from when you blacklist them. So the certificate some website got six months ago keeps working until it expires in a year and a half, but the certificate someone gets from them tomorrow fails immediately because it expires two years and a day after you removed the CA, which the site operator will discover in their testing and use a different CA before it reaches production.",1404842961

The pitch from the PR person wasn&#x27;t that great -- if I&#x27;m honest -- but talking about it with my managing editor, I found an angle in it that is actually interesting for me. Now, the approach and angle I take may not align with what the PR person/company intended (in fact, they might not love the final article I write), but there was certainly something interesting there if spun correctly. If I were in the PR person&#x27;s shoes, I would have pitched people like me the angle I&#x27;m going to go with, rather than the more generic party line.<p>And then there is also the unspoken, but part of the game, quid pro quo. Which basically means, &quot;I have this shitty client, I&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s shitty but if you&#x27;ll give it a chance, I&#x27;ll give you better/early access to my better clients in the future.&quot; There are some journalists and publications that will claim they don&#x27;t follow this sort of arrangement, because it&#x27;s one of he unseemly aspects of how stuff works, but everyone does it to some degree. Anyone (or publication) that claims otherwise is either lying or is inconsequential in size and influence. That doesn&#x27;t mean every journalist will write up something they don&#x27;t like or care about because it will get them access to something better, but if a PR firm has a good history of access and offering good stuff and they say, &quot;look, will you talk to X&quot; - you might have a conversation when you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t strictly on the strength of that relationship.<p>And yes, the best PR places simply refuse to take on shitty clients. And as journalists, we learn what PR people to ignore and which ones consistently bring us good stuff. There&#x27;s always a line.<p>It all comes down to relationships.

Was fio configured to bypass the file system cache and perform I/O directly to disk? (And if so, what is the rationale for bypassing it?[1]) Was iostat or other tools run during the benchmark to confirm that fio was configured and operating correctly, and that the results could be trusted? Was the same version of fio used, and built with the same compiler (same binary?).<p>The 118 page report does not include the actual fio commands used.<p>[1] Disk I/O latency can be a serious issue in cloud environments, and one that vendors can address by incorporating additional levels of storage I/O cache (eg, in the hypervisor). Picking benchmarks that bypass discourages vendors from doing this, which is not ultimately good for our industry.",1404842403

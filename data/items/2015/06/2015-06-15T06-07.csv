This really helps a lot.
When you put things out there like this you have no idea if it makes any sense so thanks again.<p>Wordpress is still a great solution for many projects.<p>However, there are a lot of web designers who need to allow clients to edit only one or two pages of a site. They don&#x27;t need to change the design or add new pages or anything else. That would freak them out.<p>Plus - they work with static HTML templates like Bootstrap themes or other and don&#x27;t want (can&#x27;t) convert it to a WP theme.<p>Lots of solutions for this purpose are around (CushyCMS, SurrealCMS, PageLime etc) - this is another in that vein - but there are differences to all of these.<p>If the right project or client came up then this would work really well.<p>Or you could roll your own with Octopress/Jekyll.<p>cheers again",1434351399

This is a design pattern I think is being repeated in systemd.</i><p>I kinda had the opposite impression. I first encountered systemd when I started messing around with arch for a couple little vps projects. At the time I was doing sysadmin that involved both Ubuntu and CentOS, and I definitely found day-to-day tasks easier with systemd (better built in monitoring, consistent syntax, etc). For simple cases, writing a unit file sucks <i>a lot less</i> than writing an initscript. The warts in systemd only started to irritate me when I was first setting up my personal machines (one laptop, one tower) to run arch [1]. Even then, the bloat in the design irked me more than actually using it. So, I&#x27;m in favor of systemd, but not thrilled (dbus everywhere is annoying).<p>Then again, I don&#x27;t maintain any packages with strange and/or complex daemons. If anybody&#x27;s had a really hard time getting their stuff to work with systemd, I&#x27;d be interested to hear stories.<p>1: Not completely true. I want my damn log files back.",1434351239

For example, the author mentions babysitting the users (systemctl edit) and config/daemon reloading as things that could be made automatic, I&#x27;m assuming with e.g. inotify change events.<p>But you often want some confidence that the change you&#x27;re making to your system is what you expect, and we&#x27;ve had them all along:<p>- visudo(8) sanity checks, for atomicity and syntax, to help prevent you from bricking your authorization<p>- an explicit SIGHUP to reload the configuration file for your daemon, after you&#x27;ve checked the config, rather than accidentally saving your file while you&#x27;re editing it and bringing down your daemon.<p>You could expect everyone to adopt new practices for editing the configurations, but the behavior would be very surprising to anyone used to the old way.",1434351227

By default, people accept that paying for things is right. The challenge is to make paying for things easier than not, and to not actively sabotage the social relationship that makes customers prefer paying for things to pirating them. Steam has actually done a reasonable job at that: by contrast, DRM and MPAA/RIAA-style tactics are, to understate, recent-severe-head-wound-level dumb business decisions; they say to customers &quot;our relationship with you is fundamentally antagonistic.&quot; Once that social message has been sent and supremely customer-hostile services like Ultraviolet (and worse earlier systems) established, piracy becomes massively attractive and the MPAA/RIAA-style cartels have cut off the ability to have a reasonable conversation about it.",1434351008

The culture at the company has improved during that time, but it wasn&#x27;t starting from a poor place, especially relative to the perception of EA or the video gaming industry generally.  Issues like poor work/life balance and &quot;crunch&quot; culture are openly talked about internally and there is a lot of momentum around improving it.  That extends from the highest levels of leadership - evident in delaying games to let teams hit a higher quality bar without killing themselves in the process - to studio/team level managers who see overtime as a failure.  Some EA studios are even recruiting on the basis of the very positive cultures they&#x27;ve created:  <a href=""http://careers.ea.com/our-locations/los-angeles-eala"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.ea.com/our-locations/los-angeles-eala</a>.<p>All of that is to say nothing about the many positives of working at EA: industry leading technology, storied franchises in a diverse array of genres, internal mobility both geographically and in role, and more.

The problem is that when I have 10 or 20 units with interlocking dependencies, it&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to try and untangle because I have to jump between so many different files.  Having to specify After=X and Requires=X seems like a prime example of optimizing for the 1% usecase.  99% of the time, when A must start after B, it&#x27;s <i>because</i> A requires B.  Having to specify both is something that is easily and often missed, and a hard problem to track down if you didn&#x27;t read the documentation carefully.  There&#x27;s also the problem that it seems to be metastasizing and taking other parts of the OS.  The longstanding /var/log/messages is now replaced by journalctl tool, and the logs are actually in binary.  The venerable &quot;hostname&quot; command is now &quot;hostnamectl&quot; because it must go through systemd.

I have to say, this is a great idea. There was some information lost in

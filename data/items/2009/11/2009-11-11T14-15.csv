You get a 'zero-knowledge knowledge environment' (everything's encrypted on the client-side before upload, and they can't even see the file names or other meta-data). You can use an unlimited number of devices, sync folders between machines, no special 'dropbox' folder is required, share folders with others, and use their web interface (though I'm not sure what the implications of using that are on the 'zero-knowledge environment'...I don't know how they've designed that).",1257948476

I'd put my weight behind XHTML2 winning but that sadly seems to look ever less likely. I'd assumed that if I kept my <img /> and <meta />, etc., void tags as is things would work fine .. it looks like they should.<p>But, the whatwg who have many more people and spend many more hours on this tell me ""it's not that simple, it won't work"" I tend to have to take that on face value - I can't afford to write 40 pages using XHTML style void tags and then have an FF upgrade baulk because some nuance of HTML5 parsing spews at my tags.<p>FWIW.",1257948019

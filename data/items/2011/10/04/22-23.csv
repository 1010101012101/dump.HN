I would be very surprised if Amazon hasn't done some downstream merging or porting of the features you mentioned, or been working on similar speed and performance improvements on their own. At this point, Amazon knows that they need a fast, performant tablet in order to do well in the market. Historically speaking, they know that moving first (into the non-premium tablet market) will not guarantee success. Quality does.<p>In regards to the tablet market, I'm not sure about 1-2 billion tablet customers. That's 1-2 out of every seven people owning a tablet, which is probably not realistic. I can see an easy 500 million customer in 5 years, which is a very conservative estimate. Whether the trend will continue past 1 billion, though, isn't really predictable right now. If tablet do end up becoming the computers for non-techies, though, then your prediction will probably hold, though it may be more like 15 years.",1317769169

3073177,comment,3071854,3071854,10,0,gasull,,,"tl;dr is in the one-to-last paragraph:<p><i>A quitter never wins and a winner never quits. In 1937, a self-help pundit named Napoleon Hill included that phrase in his very popular book Think and Grow Rich. Hill was inspired in part by the rags-to-riches industrialist Andrew Carnegie. These days the phrase is often attributed to Vince Lombardi, the legendarily tough football coach. What a lineage! And it does make a lot of sense, doesnt it? Of course it takes tremendous amounts of time and effort and, for lack of a more scientific word, stick-to-itiveness, to make any real progress in the world. But time and effort and even stick-to-itiveness are not in infinite supply. Remember the opportunity cost: every hour, every ounce of effort you spend here cannot be spent there. So let me counter Napoleon Hills phrase with another one, certainly not as well known. Its something that Stella Adler, the great acting coach, used to say: Your choice is your talent. So choosing the right path, the right project, the right job or passion or religion  thats where the treasure lies; thats where the value lies. So if you realize that youve made a wrong choice  even if already youve sunk way too much cost into it  well, Ive got one word to say to you, my friend. Quit.</i>",1317766752

It never gives any benefit. However ""may as well do it just in case it works"". Trivial to disprove but still<p>The close door button on the elevators in my work building work as follows:<p>1. After summoning the elevator, if I enter and press the door close button, the door immediately starts to close--even if I have not selected a destination. If I do not press the door close button, the door closes automatically after several seconds.<p>2. If I press the door open button to interrupt a door closing, as soon as the door finishes opening the door close button makes it close. If the door close is not pressed, the door closed on its own after approximately five seconds.<p>3. When the elevator arrives at a destination floor, if I press the door close as soon as the door finishes opening, it immediately starts closing.

I just hope that this happens before we see too much damage to companies like Kickstarter that are doing good work.",1317765866

At a certain point, I do feel like it's unproductive to keep second guessing how our answers will be parsed - we're just doing our best to listen to the great advice out here on HN, lay out the facts about ourselves, and hopefully make a good impression. Hopefully YC will like what we have to say!<p>BTW - my group of 3 is quitting Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to pursue our idea, and we will definitely do it with or without YC. It'd just be super nice to get that level of support.",1317765812

SF that purports to be scientifically rigorous in some way, or in some way predicting the future, seems to me to be missing the point. Science fiction is about today; it is about the world right now. SF is interesting in so far as it makes you consider the current condition in a different way. In so far as it is scientifically accurate, then it is speculative prediction, not science <i>fiction</i>.",1317765812

In part, that might be because the consensus is so strong; it wouldn't be overruling a handful of rogue admins, but a large portion of the Italian Wikipedia's editors (straw-poll here: <a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bar/Discussioni/Comma_29_e_Wikipedia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bar/Discussioni/Comma...</a>), which it prefers not to do unless absolutely necessary. A number of people in the organization, speaking in their private capacity, appear to also be fairly sympathetic to the protest, and not inclined to overturn it in a heavy-handed manner (perhaps there will be some informal negotiation to bring the site back online without condemning or officially ""overturning"" the protest).",1317765631

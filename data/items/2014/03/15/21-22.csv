Objectively best for what?).<p>And I severely doubt for example GitHub put the carpet there to justify that they didn&#x27;t hire some people (&quot;see, we didn&#x27;t hire you because you were not good enough, ktx bye&quot;). They seem to be more driven by idealism, which would speak for the &quot;we try to hire good people&quot; interpretation.<p>I suppose they might also refer to open source in general. Again, what other criteria than merit would work in open source? Should sub-par merge requests be accepted out of a sense of fairness?<p>Sorry, I am really trying to understand...<p>Btw that carpet article claims women are being kept out of the tech meritocracy. I just want to note that these women probably have perfectly fine other jobs (for example in medicine, law, journalism, whatnot). So they are not really being kept stupid and un-elite.<p>(Edit: I meant this article <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/01/24/github-meritocracy-rug#awesm=~oyCB2aORHeQU6L"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2014/01/24/github-meritocracy-rug#awesm...</a> and this quote: &quot;The tech industry isn’t still predominantly white and male because white men are better at their jobs than everyone else, it’s because many white men have had more opportunities to succeed than their minority and female counterparts.&quot; which seems unfounded to me).<p>Reading the article you linked to (not the carpet article), I have to say one of my criticisms of democracy is also that it exploits the stronger members of society. I guess some middle ground has to be found, but it doesn&#x27;t seem just to me to demand that people who contribute the most should also be made to pay the most.

(Quoting another comment of mine:)<p>Meritocracy is not a desirable state of affairs, because it should be obvious that &quot;merit&quot; is a false currency used to justify what is, rather than work toward what should be. It is the quintessential naturalistic fallacy. By definition, an is-ought fallacy such as Meritocracy can not be an ideal (if you misunderstand meritocracy to mean &quot;everyone gets what they deserve&quot; that cannot be an ideal either, as it would be no different from &quot;a world ruled by God&quot;, which is an imagined state rather than an ideal).<p>It amazes me time and again how people can take the term seriously, which only demonstrates how dangerous it is. Such a blatant, perverted joke, a dystopia that some intelligent people mistake for a utopia. Wikipedia says this: &quot;Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term &quot;meritocracy&quot; was first coined in the 1950s. It was used by British politician and sociologist, Michael Young in his 1958 satirical essay, The Rise of the Meritocracy, which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else... In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.&quot;<p>I still can&#x27;t fathom how meritocracy can be taken as anything but a negative. I mean, the first question that comes to mind (or, rather, the second after &quot;what is merit&quot;) is, &quot;who has merit and why, and who does not?&quot; Once this question is asked, it is immediately apparent that any attempt to paint &quot;meritocracy&quot; in a positive light is ludicrous.",1394919168

In a large company, where both the victim and the harasser are relatively small in the overall scheme of things, HR is (assuming the department is somewhat competent at its job) likely to be somewhat useful to a victim, simply because the downside risk to the company of not dealing with harassment is probably much greater than the value of even a supervisory employee. Even with a higher-level harasser, in a large company the firm is more likely to have established protocols, the violation of which would increase the risk to the company, which might make HR more useful to victims.<p>At smaller companies, its less likely that HR will be useful, and, at any company, its a given that HR&#x27;s primary interest isn&#x27;t protecting the victim its protecting the company (including, especially, against a potential lawsuit <i>by</i> the victim).<p>And, all that aside, yes, there is often a stigma attached to reporting the kind of things which constitute sexual harassment (a stigma which is reinforced by a society which engages in victim-blaming and slut-shaming), and, despite the laws against such, a very common fear of retaliation.",1394918785

That&#x27;s the definition of a disruptive innovation, right?<p>Take Uber for example.  Their core strength is logistics; they connect instantaneous demand for transportation with surplus supply.  They could try to sell this as a service to the existing taxicab/limo industry, but their incentives are seriously misaligned.  Taxis and limos have an industry structure that remains profitable because they own a supply-restricted monopoly on transportation (through medallions & branding) that lets each driver charge premium prices.  Adopting Uber&#x27;s technology doesn&#x27;t let them serve more customers (they&#x27;re limited by driving time), nor does it let them charge more (it would probably <i>drop</i> the price through higher availability), and so there&#x27;s no incentive for them to buy it.  However, if Uber targets a <i>different</i> population of drivers - say, those who are unemployed or underemployed and have free time on their hands - then <i>those</i> folks all have an incentive to adopt the technology so they could get customers where none were before.  And because the supply of Uber drivers is greater than the supply of taxicabs, this lowers prices for customers, creating wealth and a fair amount of Teamster opposition.<p>Or consider Tesla.  Their core strength is branding - they appeal to the eco-friendly, style-conscious customer who wants everyone to know they care about the environment.  If Tesla just sold batteries and a powertrain to Detroit, it wouldn&#x27;t fix the public perception of American cars as gas-guzzling clunkers at all.  This is why the public is nowhere near as excited about the Chevy Volt as about the Tesla Roadster or S.<p>I think that companies that pursue these strategies are effectively attacking longstanding structural efficiencies in the way the U.S. economy works, things that have been institutionalized because that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been.  And we&#x27;re going to see more of them in the near future, because this reliance on branding, oligopolies, and regulatory barriers to entry has been in place since the 50s, and technology has changed significantly in that time period.  There will also likely be a lot of social upheaval as well, as people get used to the emergence of new institutions.",1394918089

If there are alternatives, then you keep using Amazon and Prime only if they&#x27;re worth it. If Amazon ruins them, go somewhere else.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s <i>completely</i> wrong. I buy on Amazon because it&#x27;s extremely convenient and because I can be pretty sure that they&#x27;re going to offer a good price, likely the cheapest price available.<p>However, any time I make a purchase that&#x27;s more than $30 or so, I shop around. There is <i>no</i> shortage of other places to buy anything I&#x27;ve looked for. They usually have higher prices or worse service than Amazon and so I skip them. Occasionally they&#x27;re better, and then I buy from them.<p>There&#x27;s no lock-in, there&#x27;s no monopoly, there&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> that makes people stick with Amazon besides better prices, better service, and inertia.<p>If you don&#x27;t like it, go somewhere else. It pains me to say this because that phrase is <i>so</i> overused, but it applies to Amazon well.",1394918040

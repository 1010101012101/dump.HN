I definitely wouldn't call either the experiment or the conclusions ""trivial"".  This type of experiment and the development of bright tabletop xray sources is well worth the grant money invested.  Also I think an important point is that while the pulses used to illuminate the sample have very high power they are only ~40 femtoseconds long so the total energy used is pretty small.<p>The complaints about scientists and journalists overhyping their work to get funding, remind me of the accusations that tv networks and producers exploit sex and violence to boost ratings.

You can't just walk into a class and expect to pull a good lesson out of thin air. Knowing material and being able to teach it well to students are two different things. <i>Teaching</i> is a skill that is independent of the knowledge you're trying to impart. Developing that skill takes time and effort.<p>Professors frequently have to grade their own homework. TAs are not in infinite supply. I know my adviser commonly has to grade his own assignments.<p>I said nothing about professors getting money from the IP they created. In fact, what I said was that most professors make every attempt to make their work as freely available as possible. It is in their own best interest to do so.

Where did I argue that?<p>> <i>“hurt more than they help”</i><p>Have any evidence (or even reasoning) to back that up?<p>> <i>“shade their eyes from all the flaws”</i><p>Do you have any evidence that Mary Lou has done that? Nicholas has, in public perhaps (though I’d be cautious to say that even).<p>> <i>“deprives those kids of actual working PCs”</i><p>Can you back that up with a plausible explanation? As far as I can tell, not a single person has been “deprived” of a PC because of the OLPC project, and you’re the only one who is suggesting so.<p>* * *<p>This is a very narrow discussion, in which you insulted and maligned someone with no cause, and I called you out on it, and then you tried to make it stick rather than apologizing as would be appropriate for a reputable discussion. I haven’t made any claims about everything else being great, or anything of the kind, and I don’t even really see how you’re reading that into any of my statements.<p>* * *<p>Edit:<p>> <i>“ people like her go around thinking their good intentions mean something without end results.”</i><p>I also want to push back on this point. First, good intentions + deliberate action really does mean something, even in the unlikely even that they have no result. I personally think there is nothing more important in the world than the combination of good intentions plus the willingness to back those up with action.  (An only slightly joking quesion: What have you done for the children of the world recently?)  But second, the whole point of Mary Lou’s post is that there <i>has</i> been a result.  The “netbook” market is growing by leaps and bounds, and more and more children all over the place are getting their hands on various kinds of laptops, whether made by OLPC or otherwise.  This was always Nicholas’s primary publicly stated goal (whether he had different private goals I have no idea), and the success on that front more than justifies the effort.",1248792246

Your argument boils down to the OLPC is great no matter what so anyone who dares question it or her is wrong by default.<p>For the record, this didn't start out as an attack on Ms. Jepsen who I said probably had good intentions.  My point is people like her go around thinking their good intentions mean something without end results.  So they end up pushing things like the OLPC which hurt more than they help.  Then they laud themselves and their partners for having been such great people and done such a great thing and shade their eyes from all the flaws.<p>Every reports I've heard has said the OLPCs have major hardware and software problems and my own died pretty shortly after I opened it up.

The arguments that have been made in the last few days that suggest the OLPC is flawed are perfectly valid.  The only people I've seen deny them are people like you who worked for the project.  So assuming those flaws are real (again, I'm living proof since mine broke 2 weeks out) imagine a country who bought 1000 OLPCs for 1000 kids rather than 500 Windows or Linux PCs.

A good way to engeder goodwill from others is to start off by talking about them, and not about yourself. Compare ""If you were looking for replies,"" (starting to talk about what you want) vs ""Scala is a better language than Ruby anyways."" (which is an automatic trollish statement that puts your intended audience on the defensive right from the beginning)<p>Now, first of all, it's entirely possible that the Ruby community as a whole doesn't care about getting into the enterprise. I don't pretend to speak for the whole community, and obviously (via the article), some do. Competing on the JVM may not be the best way to promote the language as a whole. As you've said, the space is getting crowded, and if Ruby bets its cards on being the dynamic language of choice for the JVM, and then misses its target, how would that look? I won't deny that JRuby is an awesome thing, as I personally would like to see Ruby used (almost) everywhere. However, it's not as if, say, PHP gets maligned because it's not 'enterprisy' enough. It does for totally different reasons, and well-deserved ones at that. But the language is doing quite well without being able to be run on the JVM.<p>As far as concurrency and garbage collection go, I think it's hardly fair to judge all of Ruby on 1.8.7. YARV holds quite a bit of promise, and just goes to show how with just a little bit of care, Ruby can be made to be on par with every other language out there. See the link below for the comparison between 1.9 and 1.8. Now, in a pragmatic sense, this doesn't affect things _right now_, but they do change the near future quite a bit. So yes, Ruby's concurrency and gc may not be the best, but it's not as if there's no improvement or work being done.<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv&lang2=ruby&box=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=al...</a>",1248790050

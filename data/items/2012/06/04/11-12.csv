But there are for example best practice guidelines by Sun/Oracle. If you try to follow all that stuff, it will be painful.<p>Also most libraries for Java were written other Java developers. For example the other day I tried to send a simple Twitter update with Twitter4J (I think that was the name, might mistake it with another one). After an eternity trying to figure out how to configure OAuth with the AbstractAuthenticationProviderAuthenticatorCredentialsMessUpperInterfaceImpl (which requires clicking through several levels of the API dopcs to get the hang of), I eventually gave up and just used a 10 lines Ruby script instead.",1338811186

Sure you get to know the most common pitfalls, but it just feels like even experienced JS programmers get bitten every now and then.<p>By now I'm sure everyone has seen the WAT talk (<a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat</a>) which illustrates some of the more obscure (and funny) coercions.<p>It's ok to say that JS's type coercion is a misfeature, good programmers learn to not throw out the baby with the bathwater.",1338811177

At least not if you are doing ""normal"" stuff.<p>Let me give you an example of what kind of stuff you will come head to head with:<p>Recently I was installing and configuring a Riak cluster. I wanted to configure it to use multi backend with a large partition ring. What these are is not essential to our discussion here. What is essential is that I hit the riak user's limit for simultaneously open files. This is a thing controlled by the kernel, but configurable in userspace. If you are interested, you can find how to raise the limit by using Google.<p>This is the kind of ""kernel tweaking"" one usually needs to do. 1. How to make it work 2. how to make it persistent after server restart 3. WTF?! it's not the same in debian/ubuntu and Red Hat (half of the solutions I found don't work)<p>But the harder part is not finding the solution. The harder part is finding out what is the problem. In order to do so, you need to have experience. Know where are the logs, know which logs to look at. Know how different systems behave under such conditions (in my case, Erlang VM). Be proficient with shell tools for diagnostics. Be able to use emacs or vi(m) on the spot (you have no graphical environment) etc.<p>And there is no easy way in obtaining this skills. The only way is to get your hands dirty. Very dirty. Build systems, break systems, fix systems. You can't be good by just following tutorials, nor by using a sandboxed environment like a VPS.",1338810905

4063568,comment,4063236,4063236,20,0,mtgx,,,"I think the real issue with this is that it stops manufacturers from bundling Windows RT with Android. Take Asus for example. They've just made their ""big"" announcement which everyone thought it would be a dual-booting Windows RT/Android machine, and it turns out it's just Windows with the Bluestacks program that can make it run Android apps inside Windows.<p>I find that pretty silly, and I don't see a real reason why they didn't just make the machine dual-boot both Windows and Android. If users want Android apps inside Windows, they can download Bluestacks themselves. So the only explanation is that Microsoft is coercing manufacturers into not allowing Android or other OS's alongside Windows.<p>If they are doing this now, and more Linux vendors start asking for Microsoft's ""permission"" to boot their OS on the Windows machines with UEFI, what's to stop Microsoft from denying a UEFI license to someone who's starting to become a ""real"" competitor to Windows (like Android is, in some cases)? What if Ubuntu gets to 10% market share in the next 5 years, and keeps growing? Will they keep giving Canonical the UEFI license? What's guaranteeing that they will, if they are already banning Android from the Windows RT machines?",1338810815

A lot of the stuff one has to do in Java to get halfway decent encapsulation/abstraction is just not necessary if you use a more expressive language and write code in a more functional way. Not that JavaScript makes that particularly easy or that it's even a nice language, but it <i>is</i> more expressive than Java. With first class functions and closures alone a lot of the Java boilerplate just vanishes. Not that I want to defend JavaScript, I personally think it's a horrible language, especially for large programs. But I think Java seriously suffers from lack of expressiveness which results in an explosion of classes to implement convoluted design patterns and such.

1095688,comment,1095394,1095394,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"So Chanos may turn out to be wrong, but not for the reasons Friedman thinks he is.  This is probably a reasonable view.<p>Professor Pettis is also correct in asserting that the role of central bank reserves is one of the most misunderstood concepts in economics.  In fact, nowadays, almost any economic concept as it relates to governments or sovereign states are routinely misunderstood. Probably because that is precisely the part of the economy that the average person feels they understand so well.<p>For instance, many people worry, rightly by the way, about our USD1.4 Trillion deficit. They feel qualified to comment on its implications authoritatively since we can SORT OF understand the concept. Yet you see no publicly expressed concern at all over the USD500 Trillion house of cards that is the derivatives market. Very few people understand derivatives markets well enough to know the implications of this situation. I think this causes us not to think about it and to hope that someone else will deal with it before the bottom falls out.<p>Now understand that these guys are not average at all. I have attended Pettis' talks and he is definitely not average. But I think the same sort of intellectual dynamic goes on even in their circle.",1265136790

They'll be able to keep it up for a decade or two, but over time the whole thing crumbles as the base was never truly well built.<p>Our biggest advantage lies in the risk taking aspects of our culture. We're a people that celebrates the type of risk that leads to true innovation. The cool thing: It's not just the U.S. anymore. Europe has caught on as well.<p>I do think the United States is going to weaken (relatively) in the coming decade.

It's part of the whole American declinism notion that pops up every ten years or so and I've never believed it. We were there with Japan in the 80s, The Soviet Union, the EU, and now China (and India too). It's easy to believe China is going to be the next superpower if you look at its growth relative to the U.S over the last decade. But the thing that's always made me skeptical about any country replacing the U.S as the world's lone superpower any time soon isn't our resources. It's our sense of mission and purpose in the world. It's something that nobody else has. Only we have it because it's in our cultural fabric. It's not something you create on purpose. It grows organically out of a hapenstance of historical events. It informs everything else about us. You see it when you travel to other countries and come back. Americaness is optimism and hope. It's a source of our soft power, which is extremely attractive to the rest of the world. It's why everyone wants to be American but nobody secretly wishes they were Chinese or Nigerian or Brazilian. China or Russia or the EU or India don't have that sense of mission and purpose in their psyche. No amount of military hardware or GDP growth can compensate for that.Superpowerdom is unsustainable without it. So China could be a paper tiger.",1265136152

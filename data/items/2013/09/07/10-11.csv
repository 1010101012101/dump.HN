In my case I don&#x27;t care that much about grammar even in my mother tongue(s) probably because I grew up mostly bilingual (my parents only speak Spanish, but since I was 4 years old a good deal of the TV I watched and all my school time was in Catalan) but not completely, meaning that I&#x27;m likely to make (relatively minor) grammar mistakes in <i>both</i> languages. This makes me overlook this kind of mistakes (grammar) because the patterns are not that hard-wired in my brain, whereas syntax is stronger. I&#x27;m not sure but probably reading a lot (which I used to do, now I read mostly in English) made syntax stick stronger than grammar (a good question would be why: grammar is patterns, syntax is elements...)<p>Don&#x27;t worry, I didn&#x27;t want to call the syntax nazi police on you, neither the grammar police :) I just found slightly funny you overlooked the (for me) clear error but pointed things I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to: it was a good reminder that I should be more careful with my grammar ;)<p>PS: Oh crap, just read your user info...

6344655,comment,6344114,6344521,9,0,Amadou,,,"Trader Joes has a very loyal customer base, sometimes described as fanatical.  Based on their continuing expansion ( <a href=""http://www.traderjoes.com/stores/index.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.traderjoes.com/stores/index.asp</a> ) they appear to be very successful.   They are owned by Aldi Nord.<p>In my case it wasn&#x27;t really that I was attracted to shopping at Trader Joes, so much as the bullshit at all the other grocery stores pushed me away.  For example, a couple of them now have advertising videos (with loud audio) running right in your face as you stand in the checkout line.  That sent my aggravation level through the roof.  The very last time I was in one of those stores I literally abandoned my cart in the line and walked out because of it.  I simply could not take it.<p>Trader Joes isn&#x27;t perfect, but they don&#x27;t come across as contemptuous the way the extreme bullshitters do.   I think there is at least a lesson here about the &quot;arms race&quot; of marketing bullshit.<p>For decades, maybe centuries, stores have run sales.  They are a level of bullshit, it adds to the cognitive load by making customers decide to buy now or wait for a possible sale in the future.  But it&#x27;s low-level enough that few people are annoyed by weekly sales.<p>It is only in the recent ~20 years that we&#x27;ve seen a major escalation of bullshit at grocery stores.  Technology has enabled things like loyalty cards, targeted marketing, individualized flyers in the mail, purchase-specific coupons on check-out, blaring videos through-out the store, etc.  This marketing bullshit may well be feeding itself.  But the greater the bullshit, the more obvious to the customers just how much better opting out would be.  At some point it becomes obvious to the majority of customers that &quot;the only winning move is not to play.&quot;<p>At least I hope so because that end game means the real bullshitters get punished for it, rather than rewarded as hcarvalhoalves postulated.",1378550421

6344647,comment,6344363,6344363,0,0,noloqy,,,"What&#x27;s the problem exactly? Job growth has been stagnant for 5 years?<p>Productivity is the ratio of units of output per unit of input, where you can abstract input as being either capital or labor. Indeed, productivity continues to grow as a consequence of technological advances. When mankind started using oxes to plough fields, landworkers&#x27; productivity rose significantly. As we develop more tools to aid us in daily tasks, less labor - and sometimes even less capital - is required to perform those tasks.<p>During the relatively prosperous past decades, organizations have grown heavy, and were able to do so because of a continuously rising product demand. People started over-working and over-consuming. Then there was an external shock, media started talking about a financial crisis, people started being more considerate of their consumption in the face of job insecurity, and businesses that grew too heavy needed to get back into shape. This is a process that has significant feedback effects. The process of business getting back into shape means the cutting non-contributing jobs (think of excess layers of management), which by itself causes a growth in productivity. In this sense, employment growth and productivity growth can be negatively correlated, and it is not necessarily &quot;technological advances&quot; that drive productivity growth.<p>Telling us that technology is destroying our jobs is the same as telling us that China is stealing our jobs, though they may affect different industries (I don&#x27;t see Chinese laborers replacing our butchers.) The thing is that the working population is very flexible, and despite offshoring certain jobs the average American still works over 50 hours a week. Population growth hasn&#x27;t justified job growth in the US for the past 40 years, so perhaps a stagnant job growth is a good thing in that it draws things back to &quot;normality&quot;.",1378550199

But nothing you&#x27;ve so far suggested is new. I felt lectured down to and I felt supremely pissed off by it.<p>My remark that we should stop talking was because it was becoming increasingly acrimonious and I didn&#x27;t see the point in further e-peen waving.<p>> <i>you deduced this was the case by inspecting created_tmp_disk_tables</i><p>I did.<p>> <i>I then asked if you tried removing the disk from the picture by creating a RAM disk</i><p>I did in 2007, actually, on a physical server I had access to. It would reliably lock up the DomU. I might not have been the only one[1]. I think I moved to Linode in 2008.<p>> <i>So now I&#x27;m left wondering if you genuinely don&#x27;t know how to scale MySQL</i><p>Entirely possible. I have as little to do with MySQL as I can. When the site slows down I learn a little more.<p>Take for example the documentation you referred to, in particular:<p><pre><code>    Some conditions prevent the use of an in-memory \n    temporary table, in which case the server uses an \n    on-disk table instead:\n\n    * Presence of a BLOB or TEXT column in the table\n</code></pre>\nI learnt about that after a long period of fiddling with the tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size values.<p>> <i>What I&#x27;m telling you, is the notion that your blog network creating a workload for MySQL that it is incapable of operating on commodity disk is completely ridiculous, and I&#x27;d laugh you out of an interview if I pressed you like this.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t believe it either. Yet there it was, chewing up disk. I got a lot of relief from implementing various caching strategies, switching web servers and so on and so forth. But eventually it was consistently bottlenecked on the database. So I broke the site into two servers, which gave me a few more years. But eventually it was, again, bottlenecked on MySQL.<p>> <i>You&#x27;re basically saying you couldn&#x27;t make MySQL work with a <50QPS write load (I refuse to believe you&#x27;re writing more than 50QPS to MySQL) because of some TEXT columns.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s inserting. I&#x27;m saying that it creates temp tables on disk to satisfy fairly standard page and widget queries. If you thought I was talking about insertions then I can understand your skepticism.<p>88 QPS since last restart, FWIW. Hardly the world&#x27;s biggest installation. About 90% of queries are served from the query cache; but of those that aren&#x27;t, around 44% of joins are performed on-disk. That&#x27;s pretty much what I&#x27;ve seen every time I look: around 45% of joins going to disk.<p>> <i>I probably could make MySQL keep up with my blog workload, I just didn&#x27;t put much effort into it and bought SSDs on a provider I don&#x27;t prefer instead.</i><p>At the start of this thread you said that you&#x27;ve had varnish serve 3k RPS in front of a Wordpress instance on modest hardware. I agree that such performance is doable, even quite straightforward, for the common use case.<p>But if you take away caching, Wordpress is not quite so performant. And that&#x27;s my problem; the whole-page caching strategy that makes thousands of RPS fairly straightforward doesn&#x27;t work for me, because Recent Comments invalidates the entire cache.<p>So I have two choices: either I do without that particular widget and let varnish or nginx server up what are essentially static pages 95% of the time (and I have an nginx rule that does this with the gzipped pages that WP Supercache writes to disk).<p>Or I can accept that, because of the unusual pattern of usage, I am closer to the uncached baseline than most Wordpress installations are. Because the bloggers I host asked nicely, I have chosen the latter.<p>Putting my own anger down for a minute, I am happy to take any other advice you have. I projected onto you my own frustration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bugzilla.xensource.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugzilla.xensource.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1078</a>",1378549300

There&#x27;s an interesting problem with the Japanese debt - if you look at Japanese demographics the population is aging rapidly. This means that the pension funds that hold the debt will have to sell out because the money needs to be paid out. Who will they sell to? Every major institution in Japan is already stuffed to the gills with bonds, so there are two options: print money or sell to foreign investors. Printing money is balancimg on a knifes edge ( which is what the Bank of Japan is currently doing). Currently Japan pays an interest of less than 1%, and yet they spend 25% of their turnover just on interest payments. If you print money inflation and thus interest rises. When they reach 4% they will spend 100% of their income just paying interest on their loans. They can of course print more money and keep depreciating their currency, but history shows us that that doesn&#x27;t end well. Alternatively they can try to sell bonds to foreigners, but somehow I doubt that there are any takers unless the interest rate goes up.

This allows it to have an on-screen keyboard and such. It&#x27;s about half the overall size of a phone, and could easily be made smaller.<p>Assuming a device similar to that:<p>1. You can protect the device with a simple pin, and have it self-destruct or similar after a number of failed attempts.<p>2. There are a lot of great ways to handle backups.  On first thought, I would lean towards the following model.  When initializing the device, you enter a master password.  This password is fed into a ridiculously expensive KDF to create an entropy pool.  By expensive, I mean the device will spend an hour or longer deriving the entropy pool.  Since you only need to do this when first using the device, or restoring from backup, the inconvenience is minor.  The entropy pool is used to derive any and all site-specific passwords.  It is also used to derive your backup key.  From now on, as you use the device, creating new logins, etc, it can frequently and automatically create encrypted backups of this metadata and shove it to your PC/cloud.  The entropy pool is stored securely inside the device, and possibly encrypted with a pin number (see answer to #1 above).<p>Now, if you lose/damage this device, you just grab a new one, initialize it with your master password to re-create the entropy pool, and then it can sync to a backup.<p>Thanks to the ridiculously expensive KDF, a malicious attacker would need to spend one CPU hour (or more) per brute-force attempt.  Good luck!<p>Problems with this model: The master password must _still_ be a good password. None of this dog&#x27;s name nonsense.  Otherwise, anyone who gets hold of your backup(s) could chew through the top 100 passwords or something like that.  One way to help mitigate this is to mix personal information into the master KDF&#x27;s input. e.g. ask the user for their driver&#x27;s license number.  Doing this, however, exposes the user to privacy issues; should a hacker successfully crack their backup they have strong evidence who owns the now exposed logins.<p>Also, backups are still mandatory, or else you&#x27;ll be unable to re-derive your passwords and other metadata.  Since the backups are quite secure, one might feel confident storing them in the cloud.  I would prefer a fully deterministic solution, where one can just enter a website name into the device and get their password out ... but due to the varying password requirements of each site this isn&#x27;t feasible.<p>Finally, since the master password is rarely ever used, it may be difficult for the user to memorize it.  This could be mitigated by also using the master password as the device&#x27;s pin (a weak KDF can be used here), but then the user has to enter a password instead of a pin, which takes longer, every time they wish to use the device.<p>3. It can act as a bluetooth and USB keyboard.<p>The thought of such a device certainly tickles _my_ fancy.  Heck, I could build one right now, since I already have the hardware platform to do it.  But there is one fatal flaw ... you _have_ to use the device.  Suppose you&#x27;re travelling, forgot to bring it with you, and have no way to get another one.  Now you&#x27;re screwed.  The only alternative at that point is to use a software emulation of the device on a PC/phone, at which point you&#x27;ve exposed your master password to the PC and thus potential theft.  You get to look forward to coming home and cycling all your passwords later.",1378548678

Theres nothing Ive seen that would suggest that any of the major participants in the financial crisis should be in jail for their actions.<p>---<p>Misconduct of financial companies goes unnoticed and unpunished most of the time, and when it is caught the penalties are usually in the form of fines that are dwarfed by the gains accrued from misconduct. Morgan Stanley is typical of Wall Street firms in that it has been caught doing a variety of dirty deeds (which are probably just the tip of the iceberg) but has been forced to pay almost meaninglessly tiny fines in &quot;restitution&quot;.<p>The city I live in collects train-fare on the honor system.  There are no turnstiles, gates, etc..  There are machines to buy tickets and trains.  Occasionally, transit officers will perform a spot-check on a train that&#x27;s between stations and you get a fine if you don&#x27;t have a ticket or pass.  If, on average, you get spot-checked once a year, then a fine needs to cost your more than a year&#x27;s worth of passes or it makes no financial sense to buy them. Not surprisingly, the fine is several hundred dollars.  In the financial sector, the fine for being caught is a tiny fraction of buying a single one-way ticket!<p>Gorman is absolutely wrong. Penalties for financial misconduct need to be far harsher than they are now to achieve even a basic level of deterrence. This may be very difficult to achieve purely with fines.  No matter how diligently the government works to &quot;patrol the trains&quot; and set fines high enough to encourage honest behavior in the financial sector, the financial sector will find ways to game the system.  That&#x27;s their core competency! Lasting personal consequences need to exist.

Because it works (until it hits HN front page).<p>From my experience, running client sites, Google is blindly trusting anything from big brands, screwing the small business sites. It&#x27;s almost like content quality doesn&#x27;t matter at all, especially after all the animal updates (Panda, Penguin etc.) Small sites are desperate as they have lost as much as 90% of traffic for no apparent reason.<p>It must be profitable for Google too, their earnings have skyrocketed since then, even as they hit a plateau in market share. Occam&#x27;s razor and all.<p>Edit: The competing theories as to why Google does it are that Google wants to shake small business into advertising, considering that brands already do. Once you lose traffic you can advertise or close doors. Another one is that so-so search results are better to increase ad clicks. Considering that Google has a monopoly and still a strong brand, the second theory cannot be ruled out.",1378548415

The difference between 1 in 10.000 chance of death vs 1 in 1.000.000 of sickness is huge, but when presented to most people the risk seems the same (very small).",1378548252

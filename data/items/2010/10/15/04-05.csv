I have to consciously remind myself not to fall in to that trap and to recognize that my atheism is as much a result of indoctrination as your Catholicism probably is.<p>I think you're pretty brave for wearing that religious badge so openly in a place that is clearly biased towards the atheist walk of life, and filled with people who tend to see someones religion as an accident of birth rather than one that was arrived at by the scientific method or the choice of a free will but by indoctrination instead.",1287118773

After looking at your source, I then immediately realized I had to use the :body param instead of the :query param to pass in www-urlencoded values. Whether that reflects on the consistency or documentation of the API is another matter, but it just proves your point about the importance of being able to grok code.",1287118511

1793727,comment,1793436,1793436,0,0,danielnicollet,,,"Back in the days I worked at Netscape and Infoseek, two startups where early employees were raking millions in vested options sales.  I just started working then and I got in a little too late into the game.  My options never made me a dime there or at any of the 4 or 5 other companies that gave me options.<p>So to the great disappointment of recruiters I started negotiating compensation at my next jobs by always asking to trade some of the options in the package for more cold hard salary cash.  I wouldn't say no to options but unless you join a startup very early, they usually are a very risky bet to make up for, say, a pay cut from your previous position.  It's served me well.  I am not Cresus and I don't drive an expensive sports car but I do have enough in the bank for a few rainy days and I feel safe to be able to take the risks I now take as an entrepreneur myself.<p>So never forget, short of being lucky, only business owners, stockholders (not option holders) are really poised to make the big bucks if a company makes it to the top.  As an employee your options were always planned by the company CFO and its lawyers to be sufficient in numbers to just bring you the equivalent of a nice fat bonus if the company fares well.  Not more.  If you are an employee, freelancer, or contractor, try to get paid for what you do.  Don't say no to options but make sure you don't rely on them to heavily.",1287118350

They need help with their writing, marketing strategy, and approach, even if all the technical issues go away. And most of them need help with email marketing, social media, and so forth.<p>For the $200 customer, they're just going to have to figure it out on their own, using something like Wix, or Weebly, or -- if they have a little budget -- SquareSpace, GoDaddy Website Tonight, or Intuit Sites, or something like that.<p>For anyone who wants a quality site, and wants to have an effective Internet marketing strategy, they should hire someone to help them. That someone typically goes by the name ""web designer"", but a good one is as much a marketing consultant as a designer.<p>Typically, this is going to cost at least 10 times the $200 figure, but that's life. Most business people undervalue design and undervalue the web, and that's what needs to change if they are going to use it effectively.<p>So with the Webvanta hosted CMS (www.webvanta.com), we have focused on serving professional web designers, to give them a powerful tool they can use to deliver great sites to their clients. We did not attempt to make it easy for a business owner to create their own site; instead, we made it easy for a designer to create a great site, and for the business owner to then be able to add content and maintain the site.",1287118291

Their fee on $500 in that period isn't $40, it's $219.12, and I can't find any indication on their site that you can pay it off early to avoid accruing additional interest.

1793715,comment,1792457,1792457,0,0,brc,,,"To me the cause is obvious - the longer you're together, the less you try and establish what you like and dislike.  Your partner puts a plate of bacon in front of you and you eat it : they assume you like bacon.  You might tolerate bacon but not like it, but you eat it because it was prepared for you and there's no reason to say 'I don't like bacon'.  Same goes for movies : you just accept watching movies with your partner that you don't particularly care for, but you do it because you're spending time together.  The partner assumes you like that movie because you went along and didn't complain.<p>In other words, it's likely that the study miscontrues 'like' for 'doesn't actively dislike'.  I can watch romantic comedies without complaint, I don't like romantic comedies as a genre.  It's just easier to eat the food, watch the movie than it is to start a federal case over it.  After all, if you've been in a relationship for a while, chances are there might be kids, and you probably just relish the ability to watch any movie in peace and quiet.",1287117999

1793690,comment,1793400,1793561,0,0,mdasen,,,"Here are some of my thoughts on it.<p>First, a startup's advantage is that you're small.  You don't have to worry about serving 100 million users.  That means you can make your life a bit easier as you grow.  You can use a relational database while you're small, add memcached as you grow, denormalize, etc.  AppEngine makes you develop your application to your end point in some ways.  You can't use the techniques that get you out the door fast with a high-quality product.  Rather, you have to over-engineer your product to scale to a number of users you'll likely never have.  Take Stack Overflow as an example.  They're a really successful service and they're running on 5 servers and a SQL database.  Now, I'm sure they've done caching and a bit of denormalization, but the key is that they could launch without doing that and as they got more and more users they could add that in.<p>Second, Google's infrastructure doesn't really have capabilities for some of the cool things.  For example, geolocation is a pain (<a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/geosearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/geosearch.html</a>).  MapReduce doesn't really exist.  I mean, there are ways to deal with your data.  The key to MapReduce is its distributed nature - that portions of the data can be computed on different boxes at the same time and then returned.  This limits your ability to do the kind of warehouse data processing that can give you really cool results.  And AppEngine is meant for web apps, not things trying to compute stuff like Google does.  Google is addressing lots of things.  You can now get incoming email.  They introduced the task queue.  But you're beholden to a third party for a lot of things.  Part of being a startup is trying to be beholden to yourself and changing course quickly as you see something important.  AppEngine might limit you there depending on what you're looking to do.  Of course, it might also help.<p>Third, you're locked into Google's cost structure.  It isn't expensive or unfair.  However, it is likely to be more expensive than owning your own boxes if you're large and you have the issue that Google may not lower prices in step with competitors.  Amazon has been aggressively cutting prices, Linode has been upping RAM, etc.  It's a lot harder to migrate away from App Engine.<p>Fourth, you're beholden to Google for your application's health.  Google is a great company with wonderful engineers and AppEngine isn't abandoned at all.  That said, they have had datastore problems that saw the time to get one entry from the datastore rise to 1.5 seconds or higher.  Even after fixing the problem, it isn't the fastest option out there.  Note, App Engine is made to be scalable and Fast Enough.  It isn't tuned for pure speed.  Basically, you have to start closer to the more difficult to build, highly-scalable architecture that you could be building as your site grows.<p>It's a cool product.  The problem from my perspective is that there's little reason for me to engineer a site that scales to high levels if no one is going to use it.  I don't know how many people will use a site until it's built.  I have a better chance of people using my site if I can a) get it out quickly and b) add the features users want rather than the features that are easy with AppEngine.  I'm not going to get all my users overnight.  In the months it takes to get lots of users, I can optimize my code.  Plus, if it takes off, I think it would be a bit weird to be beholden to a single vendor.  Yes, there are open-source App Engine mostly compatible things out there and work arounds.  Still, it's easier to move from Linode to Amazon or Slicehost to a physical server.<p>I've rambled a little too much, but it's half past midnight.",1287116938

In the earliest stage startups with which I work, it is overwhelmingly the norm for founders and others to work for equity and often for equity alone. Such early-stage equity can be valuable if the company succeeds and is to be sharply distinguished from the ""one-tenth of one percent"" option grants that come later, after funding.<p>So, yes, at the early stages, the Valley remains enamored with ""options"" and perhaps more so than ever in the 25+ years I have been doing startups. Beyond the early stage, the lack of an IPO market has taken the luster away from the equity grants that used to excite so many in Silicon Valley and the article makes a good point that a noticeable change has occurred at that level.",1287116557

1793675,comment,1792353,1792353,0,0,annajohnson,,,"I can't speak for England or Europe but here in Australia it's typical for judges to 'award costs' to the winning party. In other words, the judge determines whether or not it's appropriate for the losing party to pay the legal costs of the winning party. It is not mandatory for judges to award costs but it is so common as to be expected.<p>In principle, awarding costs is 'fair': if Party A has caused Party B to incur legal costs in enforcing their legal rights then it's only fair for Party A to compensate Party B for their legal costs. A positive consequence of 'loser pays' is that there is far less litigation - and certainly less spurious litigation - in Australia than there might otherwise be.<p>On the other hand, while the practice seems fair in principle it can be very unfair - and financially crippling - in practice. You can imagine a situation where Party A is actually in the right, tries to appeal the judge's decision, but can't do so because they are financially in the hole because of having costs awarded against them!<p>So, while I still favour the idea of awarding costs, other mechanisms are needed to account for situations where parties are appealing decisions and the like.",1287115990

1793664,comment,1792353,1793549,0,0,grellas,,,"Actually, the individuals had initiated the suit, having been (in their view) taken advantage of by the lender. When they lost the case, they got nothing on their claims for damages and then got stuck with the tab for the lender's attorneys' fees on top of that. In this sense, assuming that they were actually right on their grievance with the lender and that the case was incorrectly decided, they got what might be called ""doubly screwed.""<p>I don't think you can have a rule that potentially awards fees to one side but not the other without creating the potential for great unfairness.<p>This item is of course anecdotal, as noted by others, but it is typical of cases I have been involved with in a career in which (apart from my transactional work with startups) many of the litigation cases I undertook involved commercial matters where the ""little guy"" had been, in effect, stabbed and left for dead by others, often a larger company. These cases are incredibly difficult to prosecute, in part because the client is often left with few resources with which to fight (for example, in one such case, which went for three years before reaching trial, a founder had his company stolen by disloyal board members who granted themselves, in serial votes aimed at avoiding any formal ""conflicts,"" large amounts of stock so as to gain control of the company, who then proceeded to terminate the founder's employment, and who then used the company's cash flow to fight his attempts to challenge the things they had <i>personally</i> done wrong - I took that one on hourly but wound up $400K into it before we won at trial and got the client restored). In these sorts of cases, the fight is tough enough and, if a client of this type also faces the prospect of paying the other side's fees on losing, the burden can become crushing.<p>All that said, I will grant that this is a difficult issue and, unlike many members of my profession, I do believe that major components of the litigation world are abusive and desperately in need of reform. My reason for highlighting a couple of examples showing the real-world impact of the loser-pay rule is not to say that it might not be a good reform but to underscore that a blanket shift away from the current rule might have unintended consequences that need to be considered carefully. After all, the ultimate goal of a court system is <i>justice</i> and not any ideological aim of helping anyone arbitrarily at the cost of fairness, whether it be big companies or the ""little guy,"" institutional defendants or consumers, or any other class of claimant or defendant.",1287115487

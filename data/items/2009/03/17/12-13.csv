519801,comment,519619,519619,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Short answer: no.<p>Long answer: I started programming when I was 13. I used to barely pass my maths exams. In 11th grade, we got to some basic Combinatorics, Complex Numbers, Coordinate Geometry and Advanced Algebra. Strangely enough, I got better at maths because I found these topics were relevant to programming and CompSci.<p>In grade 12 we got to Calculus. I couldn't figure out how it was relevant to what I was doing in my free time, and I limped along once more.<p>Don't worry. After you start programming, you'll come to like maths, if not love it. I have Discrete Maths in my next semester at college (the course is actually called Fundamentals of Computer Science) and I can't wait for this semester to end. I had calculus last semester, and I think I might fail (the results are not out yet).",1237294645

519795,comment,519619,519619,0,0,JoelMcCracken,,,"I dont think this should dissuade you. Most of my undergraduate class are really awful at math (having had to take university level calc 1 and 2 several times each), however they are effective programmers.<p>There are certain things you won't be good at, though. Like math. It will be hard to use programming to do math if you don't understand what you're trying to do. So certain things will be hard.<p>The trick is, the longer you program, the better you'll be able to ""intuit"" math. By learning programming, you develop the skills to become good at math, as long as you try hard at programming. If you want to become a 9-5 Java programmer, you probably will never have any chance at improving your math skills.<p>Programming isn't <i>that hard</i>. Not at all. I started learning younger than you.",1237294249
519794,comment,519619,519678,0,0,gommm,,,"I love learning languages but I'm not convinced it's really helpful to learn if one wants to become a programmer. That said, I would recommend to the op to try and convince his parents to let him go to another country in a host family for a few months (during summer or whatever). It may or may not be useful for programming but it really broadens the mind and it's by far the easiest and most fun way to learn a language.<p>I would recommend to just go take a python book and start playing around with pygame... Whenever you have a problem that you don't know how to do (be it 3d or whatever), ask the question on irc (after first doing a bit of research before of course) and make sure you understand the answers given to you. You can also go and ask your math teacher when it's clearly a math problem (that's what I did when I was in High School)<p>By creating actual applications (start small or you will never finish) and trying to fix problems when they arise, you will learn and have more confidence in yourself.<p>In a few years, once you have a few games, apps under your belt, it's a great time to start learning computer science more formally and read SICP or learn algorithmics because you will have a frame of reference from your previous programing that will help you really understand the materials...<p>So basically the best advice is just start programing.",1237294184

Canada, for example, can ""pull out the key"" of its CPP (Social Security equiv.) and everyone will get out at least what they put in.

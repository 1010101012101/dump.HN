This was correct.<p>His money hasn't been taken; they just won't disburse it until he does his free paperwork, as required by the US Government.  That's entirely legitimate.<p>.<p>> PayPal is the one at fault here. Don't let someone use your service without adequate ID.<p>They did not.  When OP does the rest of what he's supposed to do, he's going to have his money unlocked.<p>PayPal is being as liberal, correctly, as the law permits.<p>.<p>> Tell them and require it before you can use the service.<p>Yeah, they did.

5194862,comment,5194781,5194781,1,0,davismwfl,,,"First, I have no CS degree, instead I grew up in family businesses writing software from the time I could type.  Assuming you are good at what you do, understand how software really works, have valuable skill sets to offer and can sell yourself well I say the degree doesn't matter. When I say how software really works, I am focused on how decisions we make daily can be inefficient once compiled down or interpreted by some VM (so understanding the hardware/software interaction).  Not saying a degree fixes it, but honestly it would've shaved off some time for me in the beginning to have those base classes out of the way.  That said, I see a lot of people without CS degrees that love what they do and are better than many grads.  I think education is what you make of it, spending 100-150k to get an education at a top school doesn't mean you are any better than the guy who didn't.  And personally, sometimes I prefer the people that had to slog their way through to learn things, versus the CS grads that feel they are owed something because they have an expensive piece of paper.  But then again, I don't think that has anything to do with the degree or school as much as it does the person.<p>Just my 2 cents.  One thing I will tell you, I stopped long ago looking at whether someone has a degree on their resume.  The degree just doesn't matter if you are a smart person in general.",1360457802

5194856,comment,5194171,5194171,1,0,woah,,,"I'm not sure what the point of this article is. There's nothing wrong with governments providing their data in standardized machine readable formats. This makes it easier for groups of informed citizens, hackers looking for a side project, and non profits like CFA to process and visualize this data. They then can create tools to make it easier for citizens to see and understand what is going on 'under the hood'.<p>It's ludicrous that governments should keep the data about what they are doing with our taxes locked inside proprietary enterprise databases. Oftentimes, the only information available is a small subset or overview released once a year as a PDF. Anything more usable and parseable is a big improvement on this.<p>It's true, governments will start by only releasing things that make them look good (or at least not bad). But this is not the end goal. Eventually the stuff that they don't release becomes glaringly obvious and people start asking why.<p>The author has what sound like some valid complaints about the Canadian government. But somehow he thinks it's logical to conflate these issues with the entire open data movement.

5194853,comment,5191142,5191142,1,0,JohnHaugeland,,,"So, I'm going to hold an antithetical position here, because I've been on the other side of this, but rather than panicking and screaming ""villain,"" I took the time to understand what was going on, and I got a reversal.  I think you can too, but you'll need to discard the common contempt for PayPal and consider that they might actually have a reason for what they're doing.<p>.<p>""PayPal has closed my account because I dont have a social security number. It seems like I dont qualify for one because Im just an international student from Venezuela.""<p>I just don't believe this one bit.  People from Venezuela do use PayPal quite a bit.<p>More likely what this is actually about is that you haven't done the minimum to do business in America, which PayPal told you up front that they expected you to do.<p>They're not actually <i>able</i> to do business with you, because you haven't taken the correct steps yet.  If you say ""oh my god they're punishing me for being from the wrong country,"" you're screwed.<p>But if you figure out the problem, you can fix it.<p>Here's the thing.  In America, like in Venezuela and most of the rest of the world, you're expected to pay taxes on money transfer.  It's an income stream.<p>The social security number is how Americans track these things in their private lives.  Sure, you won't get one because you're not American, but there are foreign equivalents, and they're cheap.  We <i>do</i> want to do business with you; you just have to be clean.<p>PayPal <i>can't</i> give you your money until you do what the US Government requires.  It would be illegal.  It would make them into a criminal money laundering organization.<p>I'm not really sure; I'm no tax attorney.  But, I think what you want is an ITIN - an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.  They are free, they're available online, and they only take a couple weeks to get.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Taxpayer_Identification_Number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Taxpayer_Identificat...</a><p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Taxpayer-Identification-Numbers-%28TIN%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Taxpa...</a><p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Obtaining-an-ITIN-from-Abroad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Obtai...</a><p>It's very common in the tech community for people to hear ""PayPal shut off an account?  They're the devil!""  But in reality, this is how America keeps its money from flowing to criminal organizations, and PayPal's hands are tied here.<p>If you took the time to talk to them, and said ""listen, I didn't know there was a problem, can you help me understand what steps I need to take to get this turned around,"" it's very likely they'll actually help you, like they helped me.<p>The toxic Redditor behavior is getting out of control.  Not every time a large company does something that seems punitive is it actually in the wrong, and in this situation, they're really just following the law.  That's expected.  That's <i>correct</i>.<p>Also, to put things in perspective, you seem to be frustrated that you have to wait six months to receive five years of an average American's salary.  I mean, I don't think this is actually as bad as you're making it out to be, unless you've tied your entire life to taking money from the internet, and can't survive without it.<p>I think maybe you should consider the possibility of asking some of your users for a little spare cash through some crowdfunding site (full disclosure: I work for a crowdfunding site, which is why I'm not naming options right now, because it would be unethical.)<p>And then maybe just try to work with PayPal to fix the problem, instead of begging the internet to try to hammer-lock PayPal into breaking the law for you, because no matter how hard you try, that is never, ever going to work.<p>Try setting up a Google Voice account, and calling them on the phone.  If they can hear your fear in your voice, the human will to do good and help will come out, and they will put in effort to assist.  I promise.  That's just how people work.<p>Also consider getting in contact with the American tax authority, the IRS.  It's pretty common for people to hate and fear them, but they're actually wonderful people; their big job is to prevent rich people from cheating the system, and to support poor people, and your story is very sympathetic.  Someone from the IRS will, if you just ask, put in hours and hours to try to help you, for free.  That's what they do for a living.<p>You can choose to assume everyone's evil and out to get you, or you can choose to assume that you accidentally didn't get the rules right, and that fixing that could change things.<p>Which one of those assumptions you make will very significantly change the outcome you get.<p>There is a reason that people who expect good things from other people generally do well in life.  They're able to ask for, and receive, more help.  Bad things are fixed more reliably.  Et cetera.<p>Just make a human appeal.  ""I didn't know I screwed up.  I still don't know how.  I earned this money legitimately, and I need it.  Can you help me learn what I did wrong, so that I can fix it?""<p>Give them a chance to be good - maybe even a couple - and they will be good.<p>PayPal is not the evil faceless demon they're made out to be.  International payments are complicated, and people from other countries often get domestic law wrong.<p>But I really don't think they want to cheat you; after all, they make their money by helping you do more business.  Shutting you off doesn't do them any good.<p>Please consider approaching this like you might have made a mistake, because if it's you, and not them, then fixing it and changing this is entirely inside your power.  Taking responsibility means acquiring power.  Pointing fingers weakens you.<p>I hope the best for your situation.  Please be safe.",1360457615

And if you want a to-do list you should check out something like trello.com Otherwise, a spiral notebook and a pen is a great deal better than your inbox as a to-do list.<p>--Please feel free to ignore the following email rant.--<p>Email is a pretty impressive digital translation of the written letter. And for cases where a letter written by hand on paper would work well, email works even better. As long as by better you mean faster and without paper or stamps or penmanship. The SMTP protocol is over 30 years old and still going strong; that's pretty amazing. But email kind of sucks, too.<p>Frankly, most people aren't good at writing letters. Simply creating a meaningful subject line is difficult. And keeping a conversation germane to the stated subject is also difficult; folks often talk about multiple topics in a typical conversation. To review long conversations, one must read awkwardly from bottom to top, opposite normal English reading direction. Adding someone to a conversation in progress is also awkward. Sending another message (a correction or addition to your last message) before the person (or people) you're talking with replies creates confusion as a reply can only be made to one or the other message, dropping parts of the conversation. Attachments can be problematic. Clearly, spam the likes of which we see today was never anticipated by SMTP's authors, and neither has anyone come up with an especially successful solution to it. We've all just come to accept spam as part of the background noise, filtering the polluted stream, rather than removing the decomposing carcasses from the upstream source.<p>Creating an alternative that addresses its shortcomings would be ambitious. And I think many people were frightened by Wave, which addressed many of email's shortcomings but was disruptive in the way so many people like to claim they admire but will almost always shun in practice (kind of like how folks always claim to love to root for the underdog, unless it's Haiti). I'm not saying Wave was perfect, but it had great potential. And as far as genuinely ambitious attempts at improving email (or the kind of conversing we typically do with email), I can't think of another example.",1360457155

A 2002 experiment with this kind of usage-based e-mail pricing found that it caused senders to spend more effort targeting their messages to recipients who would find them relevant, thus shifting the cost of deciding whether a given e-mail message is relevant from the recipient to the sender (Kraut 2002).""",1360457045

It would likely take 15-30 minutes using an FDM 3-D printing process and even longer using a higher resolution SLA system.<p>+ Print-on-Demand hasn't taken off on books, why will it with physical goods? Print-on-Demand technology has been available for the better part of a decade, but Barnes & Noble and Borders never saw an opportunity to implement it. Again, this comes down to speed. For undifferentiated products, it will always be faster to mass produce.<p>+ Even taking the argument at face value that 3-D printing will help digitize inventory and create the same pressures that digital media did, I think more efficient mass production, rather than 3-D printing will be the likely case. Zara can produce limited runs of high fashion clothing and get them into malls all across the US in 2 weeks. Protomold makes low cost, small run injection molding accessible. We'll likely see more of this rather than fleets of MakerBots.<p>+ The problem with retail is the cost model of keeping store fronts open, not the way the products in it are produced. Even if we assumed there would be big box stores full of 3-D printers, they are still slow and do not have a Moore's Law like effect that will change that any time soon. If I ordered something at one of these 3-D printer stores, I'd have to wait hours to get my products. Why not just go straight to ecommerce at that point.<p>+ Producing Atoms is REALLY, REALLY hard. There are tens of thousands of different plastic formulations. Different additives, secondary processes, and assembly steps that go into high fit and finish products. Even the best 3-D printers can only handle a few materials  at most. There is no way to produce something like a pair of ""Beats by Dre"" headphones or a similarly complex electromechanical device using those systems. The simple things that can be produced would be more economical being mass produced and warehoused in a low cost location and shipped to customers rather than printed on demand.<p>Think about the difference in quality between a printer at home and one of the nice photosystems at a pro printer. Even then when dealing with paper stock and 4 colors of ink the difference is striking. Now increase the difficulty by several orders of magnitude.<p>3-D printers will have a huge impact, but more in the way open source programming languages did.

If they're interested in computers and the stuff you can do with them a gentle way to get started programming is to find and use whatever scripting language whatever programs they already use have to automate stuff and make random creative hacks, rather than starting from ""hello, world"" and learning the fundamentals first.<p>For example:<p>Have them screw with the interface of their favorite websites: pick a greasemonkey script that already does anything on that site and change it to do something different.<p>Learn the macro/scripting interface of whatever productivity software they have some reason to use already and make it do something.<p>Find a game they like that has an active scripting or modding community, and fiddle with the game rules.<p>The idea is to make the mental leap that writing software is just another way of getting the computer to do what you want, and that there's one big continuum from poking buttons in a dialog box to amateur hour hacking to writing ""proper"" software.  Eventually you'll have the ambition to do something that requires more than just plugging pieces together and making edits to stuff other people wrote, and that's when you'll be self-motivated to obtain the knowledge that will make you a more effective programmer.<p>I realize this is at a way more primitive level than most people think of as learning to program, but IMHO the CS 101 stuff where you learn a language and how to make simple programs from scratch is closer to the ""middle"" than the ""beginning"".",1360455966

I'm glad the title succeeded in that sense, as it's relevant to this article.<p>More to the point, I like this idea. I like that it focuses on the perspective of those who send you emails. I feel that many people trying to solve this idea would look to changing how inboxes handle messages or look to changing the user interface of email systems.<p>But instead, this solution actually helps reduce email by responding to senders. That's a unique approach. Very out of the box.<p>But it's true that it's ""frighteningly ambitious"" to try and tackle this problem on the sender's side. I could see this failing if the majority of senders are the type to simply send off an email and not check for a while, which would ignore the automated message query. However, if a majority of users do pay attention to it, they can edit their email options and hopefully make life easier for the receiver.<p>Excellent idea.

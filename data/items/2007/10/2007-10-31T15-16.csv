This is usually done with cryptographic signatures and that means implementing at least one other number theory algorithm with even more slow big integer exponentiation.<p>

74669,comment,74562,74562,0,0,gigamon,,,"I actually see a parallel between what's happening in web startups today and the telecom broom-and-bust that many of us older guys have experienced in 1999/2000.  Back then we had Nortel acquiring Qtera, Xros and Coretek at about $3B each, thereby setting the venture business on fire and funded about 100 startups, all determined to be better.  <p>Today we have MySpace, YouTube, Facebook and similarly numerous VC-backed startups that are trying to catch the wind.  I suspect there will be disappointments as well and recently I wrote about my own experience in surviving startup failure which I entitled ""What I learned from my Dad who taught me how to ride a bicycle"".  It is my sincere hope that this could be of value to someone.<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/riding-a-bike.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/riding-a-bike.html</a><p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu",1193844214

It only makes sense that it wouldn't be any specific social network that made it happen. I wonder if we'll see Facebook and MySpace participate in this? I'm sure it will just depend on what apps make it to what platforms.",1193843952

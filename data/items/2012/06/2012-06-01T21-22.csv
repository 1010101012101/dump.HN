I'm pretty sure that's wrong in the same way that saying every single pirated copy of something results in lost revenue (as the MPAA and RIAA contend.) It might not be <i>as</i> wrong, but it's still wrong.<p>And while there are plenty of studies that suggest piracy might help sales, there are also plenty that suggest that it does not:<p><a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-digital-piracy-really"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-digit...</a><p>In fact, while the issue is plenty debatable I'd say that <i>most</i> of the evidence comes down on the side of ""yes, piracy hurts sales, just no where near as much as the MPAA would have you think."" (Though even the article above suggests that piracy wouldn't be as much of an issue if movies were released worldwide simultaneously.)<p>Furthermore, ""hurting the creators"" needn't necessarily be financial. There are many, many artists, programmers, etc. -- not big publishers, but creators -- who <i>hate</i> piracy with a passion.  They often feel under assault by Internet companies the way that people here feel under assault by the MPAA.  I think they're misguided, but it's irresponsible to just say ""fuck you, this doesn't hurt.""<p>So no, ""hurting the creators"" is not false, probably not financially and certainly not ethically (you're doing something with their work they don't want.)  It's valid to say that the creators have to suck it up and adapt, and that many of them won't be able to make money in the ways they did before.  But they are getting hurt.",1338587747

The situation wasn't settled the first day, so my lawyer looked at the court schedule, figured out that if we asked for a continuance we'd come back to court when a different judge was presiding, who he believed - based on his knowledge of the judge's personal life - would be more favorable to our position.<p>We came back two weeks later, sat in front of the new judge, and the judge came down pretty clearly on our side, and the situation was resolved amicably.

Our dataset in Couch is 28 million records, takes up 13GB of data, and we can create a brand new view against those records and have it run the first time in less than ten minutes. Adding 20k records to this dataset might cause the view to take a couple of seconds to update. One update to the view, which is what the article complains about, takes one or two milliseconds to be added.<p>But let's hypothetically say that the author has the most complex data format in history, and the most complex view code in history, and ten writes to the database actually cause minutes worth of view index updating. Adding the ""&stale=update_after"" request parameter to your view query returns instantly, with the last-generated view. After the query is issued, the view is automatically updated. No cron jobs necessary-- it is (and should be) a drop-in addition for all of your view queries.<p>Now, about the append-only database file. We've been playing with autocompaction from CouchDB 1.2, and it seems to be working quite well, but again, at the scale the author is talking about, 20k records per day is a very predictable delta in disk space. Even running CouchDB off a 32GB compact flash card (and it is possible!) will give ample room for the size of his dataset. We run off a 120GB fibre channel mount and haven't needed to increase the partition size yet.<p>From the article:<p>""The system in question does a lot of writes of temporary data that is followed up by deletes a few days later.

Our pre-pregnancy genomic test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 1% of all births in the United States.<p>As you might imagine, handling this kind of volume puts us in terra incognita. Our situation is similar to the one faced by Amazon in the 90s, before anyone knew how to scale an operation with such highly interconnected physical and informational components.<p>To solve the problems associated with scaling the medical genome, we hire generalists rather than specialists. Our engineers are pragmatists who know when to use machine learning and when to use a simple regex, and understand in what sense those approaches are at different ends of a continuum. Many did not have a bioinformatics background before they joined, but all had strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms.<p>Experience in general means little to us as genomics is a young field; working code means quite a lot more. If this sounds like your kind of company, we invite you to apply.<p><i>About you</i><p>You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) and significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by Github account, personal web page, or prior employment.<p>You should also be a generalist, interested in rotating through the engineering team and working in one or more of these areas:<p>- Genomics: design, validate, and optimize clinical genomic assays for rare Mendelian variants<p>- Machine Learning and Data Science: extract meaning out of one of the largest clinical genomic datasets in the world<p>- Robotics: automate and scale our backend to do more clinical sequencing and genotyping than anyone has ever done before<p>- UI/UX: design the first widely adopted user interface for the medical genome<p>- Clinical Integration: solve the wide variety of practical issues associated with translating genomics into a clinical context<p>- Infrastructure: build and deploy the hardware and software systems that support secure, large-scale computations on genomic datasets<p>From a skills perspective, you should have familiarity with several of the following technologies. We obviously dont expect you to know everything on the list, but you should be nodding to yourself by the end of it.<p>- Python: Django, Numpy, Scipy, Cython<p>- HTML/CSS/JS: Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap 2, HTML5 APIs, Chrome Web Inspector<p>- C++: STL, gcc/g++, Boost, C++11<p>- Functional Programming: Haskell, underscore.js, functional reactive programming<p>- Data Science and Visualization: GNU GSL, CUDA, Netlib/LAPACK, graphviz, R, Matlab, Matplotlib, Numerical Recipes<p>- DevOps/System Administration: Amazon Web Services, Puppet, nginx, nagios, Apache, Fabric<p>- APIs: REST, JSON, SOA, and all that jazz<p>- Biological Databases: NCBI, UCSC, 1000 Genomes, Hapmap, UK10K<p>- Sequencing/Computational Biology: OLB, samtools/pysam, pygr, galaxy/bxpython, kent utilities<p>- Unix/Linux: bash/zsh, emacs/vim, git, GNU toolchain<p>- PostgreSQL: psycopg2, hstore, replication<p>- Security: skipfish, SSL, fuzz testing, preventing XSS & SQL injections<p>Again, please consider these guidelines, not absolutes. For example, if you know Chef, we figure you can learn Puppet, and if you know Ruby, we figure you can learn Python.<p>In general, you should enjoy taking care of the practical last mile problems needed to actually achieve a societal ROI on the world's multibillion dollar investment in the Human Genome Project.<p>What you'll do:<p>- Move fast without breaking things :)
- Start in the areas you're familiar with, and grow to work on the full stack
- Work closely with a small, tight-knit team
- Develop algorithms and code for all aspects of clinical genomics, from machine learning to supply chain optimization to insurance billing
- Quite literally save lives with your keyboard<p>What you'll get:<p>- Competitive compensation and start-up equity package
- Excellent health insurance
- Catered meals every day plus a fully stocked fridge
- Gym access to work it off
- MacBook Pro, 30"" monitor, iPad, iPhone, and all the gadgets you need<p>Apply online: <a href=""http://bit.ly/Counsyl_Engineering_HN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/Counsyl_Engineering_HN</a>",1338585962

There should always be a general degree of caution and since there is no way to verify that someone is a lawyer or doctor (with a few exceptions such as grellas who openly posts contact info) the assumption should be that the advice is strictly to point you in the right direction and you need to pay someone in the end).<p>With regard for the reason for this ""Ask PG"" IANAL but I have plenty to say about this by virtue of the fact that I own domains and have successfully fended off Fedx and American Express as well as several other smaller companies.

My personal experience is that disclaimers such as you gave have very little legal standing, and that what you said can be regarded as legal advice, regardless of the ""if""s, ""but""s, ""possibly""s, and ""maybe""s that you so carefully sprinkled throughout.<p>You certainly can share what you know about these things, but advice given to me in the past about similar situations is that by doing so you can be regarded by some as taking some of the responsibility for the advice you think you haven't given.<p>The law is complicated, and while you may share what you know, doing so can put you personally at serious and considerable risk.  Further, it doesn't always make sense to those who have not studied it (and sometimes even to those who have), so while what you have said may seem perfectly sensible, a lawyer may disagreed strongly with several of your suggestions, and following them may put the person you are trying to help in more trouble.<p>So despite the fact that you are trying to help, and despite the apparent soundness of your advice, you are not a lawyer, and there are very likely to be implications of which you are unaware.  I applaud your willingness to take on the personal risk of what you said, but I am concerned that you are not helping, and may be making things worse.<p><i>Edited for clarity</i>",1338585140

This happens because of fundamental physical limits, and no-one believes they can be overcome -- even the biggest proponents are talking about delaying the inevitable for a few years instead of avoiding it.<p>Right now, there is a hundred-billion-dollar stampede going on for finding out it's successor. Players include:<p>MRAM (Toshiba, Hitachi, Hynix, IBM, Everspin(Freescale spinoff), Samsung, NEC)<p>FeRAM (Ramtron, IBM, TI, Fujitsu, Samsung, Matsushita, Oki, Toshiba, Infineon, Hynix, Symetrix)<p>ReRAM (HP, ITRI, IMEC, Panasonic, Rambus)<p>CBRAM (NEC, Sony, Axon, Micron)<p>PRAM (Intel, IBM, ST Micro, Samsung, Numoxys)<p>I might have missed a few backers.

This is stuff to talk about with a lawyer, not the fucking Internet, and the person I replied to is already giving frighteningly bad advice.<p>There are legal repercussions and serious consequences to many choices we make in life; while this is a particularly tricky terrain to navigate, that doesn't mean he should go in completely blind.  If you think that the advice is ""frighteningly bad"", point out specifics.<p>> This isn't about credentials, it's about being smart when it comes to threats that can genuinely hose your business, and not listening to a bunch of armchair lawyers on HN who think they have the best course of action without any sort of context.<p>This isn't a conversation you're engaging in; you're simply shouting down the parent(s).  That's not what HN is all about.  Please rethink your approach and come back to this from a constructive angle; it sounds like you have valuable knowledge that could come in handy for OP and others, but you can't see past ""holy crap, legal advice on the internet!""",1338584429

I'd actually be surprised if anyone can find an instance of it being used as a slur.<p>Even the simple ""anarchist"" has lost popularity in the name-calling game, after the Seattle and the Iraq War protests.",1338584428

You say you ""don't steal (physical things)"" as if that makes it ok, but you <i>are</i> stealing.  It's a different form of stealing, but you do steal, you lack empathy for the act, and you are usually hurting the creators of that material in one way or another.<p>Even today, there are societies where it is ""socially acceptable"" to beat and murder women, to stone people for being heretics, etc. etc.  ""Socially acceptable"" does not provide justification for unethical acts.  Saying ""it's wrong"" and going no further than that makes you thoughtless, not humble.  You do steal, and you do hurt people.  You just don't care, because people around you are doing the same.",1338584421

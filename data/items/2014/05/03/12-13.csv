If recycling costs money (as it generally does for electronic waste, which doesn&#x27;t recover enough valuable metals to pay for the process), then people just dump things in the trash instead, even if that&#x27;s illegal. Collecting the cost of recycling up front, and then making it free to recycle at the point of disposal, greatly increases how willing people are to put their electronic waste into the right bin.<p>As far as I know that&#x27;s so far mostly for computers, not appliances, and only in some jurisdictions. How effective it is also depends on how strong the other laws around recycling are: if &quot;recycling&quot; ends up consisting of just shipping the waste to China to be processed in a questionable manner, the up-front price might not be fully pricing in the environmental damage. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good model, though, to combine responsible-disposal requirements with up-front collection of the funds to do the disposal.",1399121398
7690558,comment,7686690,7689750,2,0,tel,,,"I don&#x27;t think Haskellers bash OO that much. They bash some of the trappings of it. GoF is usually a typesafe library in Haskell because it has better abstraction capabilities. Functions form better fundamental units than objects do (but are a form of &quot;object&quot; themselves). Composition is better than inheritance. Classes are not generally so useful.<p>Really, I think Haskell has a super great object system. It&#x27;s just (a) not the central conceit and (b) so naturally embedded in the language that you can program for a long time without even noticing it&#x27;s there.<p>Codata typically indicates you&#x27;re looking at an object. In Haskell, due to it being non-terminating as a language, codata and data are unified so most &quot;objects&quot; look identical to their non-object form. You can also notice them by definitions based on eliminators. Automata are a good example<p><pre><code>    newtype Auto f i o = Auto { run :: i -> f (Auto f i o, o) }\n</code></pre>\nYou can also look for objects as ADTs. When you do this you can get a natural embedding of a prototype-based language. (<a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/adt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/adt.pdf</a>)<p><pre><code>    data ADT f = forall st \n               . ADT { unfold :: st -> f st\n                     , state  :: st\n                     }\n</code></pre>\nHere, the internal state type `st` is closed over as an existential value—when you create a new ADT you can pick what st is but the type system then ensures that <i>nobody</i> ever can access that type again. Instead, you have to use the `unfold` elimination form which projects the state into a &quot;class&quot; `f` (represented as a Functor, but that&#x27;s immaterial) which defines a signature of methods over the abstract state. Auto, from before, is definable this way.<p><pre><code>    data AutoClass st o = \n      AutoClass { next :: st\n                , out  :: o\n                }\n\n     type Auto = ADT AutoClass\n</code></pre>\nSubtyping occurs naturally with quantified types like the existentially-typed `st` variable or the universally quantified types you see all the time in type signatures. It&#x27;s a more natural form of subtyping since it&#x27;s all defined by increasing typeclass bounds. Something like<p><pre><code>        {C} : set of constraints    Ci : constraint\n    ------------------------------------------------------\n    forall a . {C} a => a :> forall a . ({C} a, Ci a) => a\n</code></pre>\nThis guarantees that these these two types are good &quot;subtypes on eliminators&quot; which satisfies the Liskov Substitution Principle if not some of the more strict definitions of subtype &quot;niceness&quot;.<p>Double/Multiple dispatch is trivially handled in Haskell since polymorphism is solved by an entire <i>Prolog</i> embedded in the type system.<p>The thing is that Haskell also has initial data, things like finite lists are better thought of as a big tree of constructors<p><pre><code>    1:(2:(3:(4:(5:[]))))\n</code></pre>\nand then pattern matched upon (defining catamorphisms)<p><pre><code>    sum :: [Int] -> Int\n    sum (a:bs) = a + sum bs\n    sum []     = 0\n</code></pre>\nand this pattern is perhaps a little bit emphasized in mainstream Haskell because it sides on the &quot;functional&quot; side of the expression problem. It doesn&#x27;t mean, though, that Haskell doesn&#x27;t like the &quot;object oriented&quot; side, but instead that Haskell favors both.",1399121309

The basic idea is that memory accesses could be observed in different order in different coherent cores, so synchronisation points require carefully placed barriers.<p>Bugs caused by not accounting for the modified Harvard architecture: the data and instruction caches aren&#x27;t coherent. If you do JIT you&#x27;ll notice odd behavior soon enough when some executable code is overwritten, but if it&#x27;s just one time dynamic code generation, there&#x27;s a fair chance most of the time there won&#x27;t be any stale data in the instruction cache. Until there is, you get odd erros and if you inspect the code in the debugger it will look just fine, since it&#x27;s fetched through the data cache.<p>DMA bugs: if the DMA peripheral isn&#x27;t connected through a cache coherent bus, it can be quite tricky to ensure you won&#x27;t accidentally transfer stale data.<p>Finally, something that&#x27;s not so much influenced by using a debugger, it&#x27;s just that the debugger is completely useless: silicon bugs. Just a few weeks ago, I found a bug in a MCU which causes it to send multiple copies of an SPI transfer for certain ratios between the peripheral&#x27;s clock and the core&#x27;s clock.

If not for a lawsuit, this tracking would&#x27;ve not come to light. Couple that with massive spending on lobbying compared to Apple and MS makes me feel uneasy. The below article makes me wonder if they use paying Google Apps for Business email accounts to build ad profiles too? Anyone know?<p>From <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.ht...</a> :<p>&quot;As part of a potentially explosive lawsuit making its way through federal court, the giant online-services provider Google has acknowledged scanning the contents of millions of email messages sent and received by student users of the company’s Apps for Education tool suite for schools.\nIn the suit, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company also faces accusations from plaintiffs that it went further, crossing a “creepy line” by using information gleaned from the scans to build “surreptitious” profiles of Apps for Education users that could be used for such purposes as targeted advertising.&quot;<p>&quot;A Google spokeswoman confirmed to Education Week that the company “scans and indexes” the emails of all Apps for Education users for a variety of purposes, including potential advertising, via automated processes that cannot be turned off—even for Apps for Education customers who elect not to receive ads. The company would not say whether those email scans are used to help build profiles of students or other Apps for Education users, but said the results of its data mining are not used to actually target ads to Apps for Education users unless they choose to receive them.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Student-data-privacy experts contend that the latter claim is contradicted by Google’s own court filings in the California suit. They describe the case as highly troubling and likely to further inflame rising national concern that protection of children’s private educational information is too lax.&quot;<p>&quot;Mr. Thiele said his district has used Google Apps for Education since 2008. Officials there have always been aware that the company does “back-end processing” of students’ email messages, he said, but the district’s agreement with Google precludes such data from being used to serve ads to students or staff members.\nAs long as the company abides by those terms, Mr. Thiele said, “I don’t have any problem with it.”\nIn an emailed statement provided to Education Week, Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said that “ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future.”&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Those plaintiffs in the California lawsuit allege that Google treats Google Apps for Education email users virtually the same as it treats consumer Gmail users. That means not only mining students’ email messages for key words and other information, but also using resulting data—including newly created derivative information, or “metadata”—for “secret user profiling” that could serve as the basis for such activities as delivering targeted ads in Google products other than Apps for Education, such as Google Search, Google+, and YouTube.&quot;<p>&quot;The plaintiffs allege that Google has employed such practices since around 2010, when it began using a new technology, known as Content Onebox, that allows the company to intercept and scan emails before they reach their intended recipients, rather than after messages are delivered to users’ inboxes, regardless of whether ads are turned off.&quot;<p>&quot;While the allegations by the plaintiffs are explosive, it’s the sworn declarations of Google representatives in response to their claims that have truly raised the eyebrows of observers and privacy experts.\nContrary to the company’s earlier public statements, Google representatives acknowledged in a September motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ request for class certification that the company’s consumer-privacy policy applies to Apps for Education users. Thus, Google argues, it has students’ (and other Apps for Education users’) consent to scan and process their emails.&quot;<p>&quot;In November, Kyle C. Wong, a lawyer representing Google, also argued in a formal declaration submitted to the court in opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification that the company’s data-mining practices are widely known, and that the plaintiffs’ complaints that the scanning and processing of their emails was done secretly are thus invalid. Mr. Wong cited extensive media coverage about Google’s data mining of Gmail consumer users’ messages, as well as the disclosures made by numerous universities to their students about how Google Apps for Education functions.&quot;",1399119861

7690482,comment,7690261,7690429,9,0,userbinator,,,"There&#x27;s also the fact that manufacturers want to make a profit, so it is in their interest to make products that last only &quot;long enough&quot; --- too short and people will complain (but gradually change this, and maybe they may not notice), too long and they&#x27;ll feel like they&#x27;re losing money. Washing machines, fridges, etc. are a mature technology that has relatively little room for improvement, so unlike e.g. computer hardware that changes at a much faster pace, the manufacturers have to drive consumption somewhat more aggressively. They also make them far (edit: more, not less) unserviceable than before.<p>I&#x27;ve always detested the &quot;newer is always better&quot; mentality that the population seems to have been conditioned into, and that the culture perpetuates; I think when the <i>only</i> reason you want to buy a new X is because your existing one is &quot;old&quot; (not unfixably broken, not slow, not missing a feature that would really improve your life), there is something seriously wrong.",1399119460

In an ideal world, we wouldn&#x27;t have to go to work for 42 hours per week and many wouldn&#x27;t need to work at all. We&#x27;d just enjoy ourselves 24/7.

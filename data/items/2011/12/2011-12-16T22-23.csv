3362707,comment,3361322,3362235,4,0,hucker,,,"I do not necessarily think the web needs generic VMs to move forward, or that JS needs replacing (I happen to enjoy JS with all its quirks quite a lot).<p>I do, however, think that such a transition is possible if the powers that be (Google, Mozilla et. al) could agree on a fairly consistent strategy.<p>Yes, 2 VMs side by side would probably be needed for some time, but 10+ years? Surely pure JS VMs could be moved to plugin status and be phased out faster than that, especially since someone would just write a compiler that compiled JS to this byte code format. No, it wouldn't be as fast as a VM highly optimized for specific JS quirks, but it could probably suffice.<p>> It would be akin to rewriting malloc.<p>Custom mallocs has been written for many different purposes like for example demanding game engines. While certainly a complicated task, it has been done numerous times.<p>> And even then, you still have to support JavaScript being written directly in HTML <script> tags, something no other language could enjoy. So every browser must include a JavaScript to (new VM) bytecode compiler. JavaScript will always be in a priviledged position.<p>Why would <script> tags HAVE to contain JS? I see no reason why if we're changing to a generic byte code web, JS in <script> tags could be phased out as well.<p>However, as I said, I actually like JavaScript and I think experiments of modernization like Dart are approaching the ""problem"" in the entirely wrong way. I only think that if we ""had"" to change up, it could be done without much degradation to the user experience if any at all. Some old sites would break, but really, who cares? If you could compile your javascript codebase to byte code and have it still work, every one would do that without much problem.",1324076087

3362705,comment,3361322,3362592,2,0,wwweston,,,"> Ubiquitous cross-platform adoption. Done.<p>Well, that's at least part of the reason why we disagree. The list is longer, and includes (but may not be limited to):<p>* view source - up until minifiers, there wasn't anything happening on the client side that you couldn't see how it was done yourself.<p>* gentle learning curve - the entry level to simple web publishing was achievable for anybody who could transfer ""view codes"" style word-processing concepts to markup and manage file transfer client. A little learning or some copy and paste could take you up the next gentle step to limited scripting.<p>* Hypermedia nature of the platform - instead of applications being little silos that only interoperate with a relatively small number of apps from the same organization (or other organizations where they've made deals), hypermedia docs were a sprawling web of connections constantly pointing to other document-applications. If you'd dropped a perfect universal VM on every desktop in 1995, it's extremely unlikely things would have fallen out like this. It certainly didn't for the imperfect one.<p>> The web grew popular (relative to the Internet population) before it got JavaScript, not after. It wasn't JavaScript that drove widespread adoption<p>A 1995 release means that the first statement is only defensible given the flexible nature of popular. The second statement is truer in decreasing terms through 2004 or so, when it bottoms out.<p>That's tangential, though. The real question is more along the lines of whether the web would be everything it is now if instead of passing around a single strain of fairly standardized (though expanding over time) markup, we instead were sending drawing instructions and collecting events. Or maybe even a single binary-encoded standard for abstracted document trees designed for optimal machine consumption, generated from various different applications or compiled from other document schemes.<p>Their answers to that question are why a lot of people think it might be a better idea to have single scripting language, and the one we've got has turned out to be pretty capable so far.",1324076002

Although I don't (can't) do everything on this list, this is more-or-less the formula I follow. I developed it while working as a manager for a variety of businesses:<p>1. Show them. Employees are less likely to care if their boss doesn't care; taking care of customers starts at the top and works its way down. For a little while I was able to manage a grocery store & restaurant with infamously bad customer service, while the owner was seriously ill. By the time the owner came back, the employees were constantly checking in with customers, straightening shelves, cleaning the store -- all the things they never did before. They did it because I would go out and do it and then ask for their help.<p>2. Don't be afraid of bad customers. Bad customers hurt employee morale; probably one of the best things I did while managing the restaurant side was walk over to a customer, kneel down to face level with them, and quietly inform them that if they ever spoke to an employee like that again, I'd throw them out. Employees will love the shit out of you if they think you have their back when it counts.<p>3. Get rid of bad employees. Everybody knows who they are; you don't have to be cruel about it, just let them know that they aren't a good fit and help them decide to move on. Bad employees are cancerous, they bring their friends and their bad attitude spreads.<p>4. Get good employees. I hire as much for an earnest and polite personality as I do for expertise. The thing is, we can train expertise; in my experience, you can't train good behavior.<p>5. Take care of your employees. If you can reduce the number of things they have to worry about when they're not at work, then they'll be happier to be at work. Pay them well, get insurance for them (and don't make a big deal of it), make sure there are clear rules in place for the occasional payday advance (and use any such occurrences to re-evaluate whether or not you're paying them well enough), be polite but firm with them, respect them. If they want to go to school and need flexible hours, support that. During the holidays, give them a little bit of paid time off, because the holidays are wickedly stressful for your staff. Don't demean them, ever; don't make them wear idiotic costumes, use stupid code words, sing jingles, or the other bullshit that makes it hard for employees to take a job seriously.<p>That's about it. It's really not that hard. Most businesses just don't care enough because the attitude at the top is that they can always use marketing to find new customers.",1324075533

Rather than trying to think of times you want to construct switch statements dynamically, try to think of times you'd like to specialize how a generic function call will respond to arguments it may not even know about.<p>In object-oriented programming, you can define a base class ""Animal"" with a method ""makeNoise"" and subclasses with a method ""makeNoise"" with that will return ""bark"" if you call a Dog's makeNoise or ""meow"" if you call a Cat's. When you first defined the Animal's ""makeNoise"" method you didn't need to know how anything about the subclasses that would eventually implement it. Your algorithms could depend on ""makeNoise"" returning the noise specific to the animal in question.<p>Multimethods are a functional approach to polymorphism without a class/prototype hierarchy. The second example in the post shows how you might implement a multimethod that calculates the area of shapes. Perhaps a separate module introduces new kinds of shapes (like new kinds of subclasses in OO). These shapes can register their area implementations with the 'area' multimethod. Other algorithms that use the 'area' multimethod will now be able to operate on these new kinds of shapes. Multimethods provide a means to polymorphism while keeping data and functionality decomposed.<p>Like swannodette says more beautifully and concisely, though, it's an even more generic/flexible dispatch than thinking in terms of OO polymorphism.",1324073601

> re-usable UI widget programming,<p>I don't think the evidence is on the side of your claims. Given the sheer number of web pages and apps out there vs the number of desktop apps, the widgets <i>built in</i> to HTML are more widely used and re-used than most desktop API widgets, and the sheer proliferation of derived DOM-composite UI elements out there (particularly contrasted to the desktop) belies any claim of unsuitability for use: DOM elements are creatively styled and glommed together with a regularity that dwarfs anything from the desktop world.<p>That's use and suitability. Re-use? There are also several well-known and a lot more lesser known libraries that do indeed provide widgets at higher level of abstraction. JavaScript provides ample facilities for abstracting the DOM manipulation behind object and method calls. Whether or not it's used is another question, but any developer that can't learn to do that job in JavaScript either can't do it because they're unwilling to learn how to wield JavaScript, or because they'd be unable to do it with any language and API.<p>> JS is frustrating for building large applications<p>How so? There are plenty of developers out there who've found that if you embrace the features the language and most runtimes offer, it isn't any more difficult to build large systems with it than any other language.

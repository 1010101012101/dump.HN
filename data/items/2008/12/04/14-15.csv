Even for new projects, if you want to depend on an existing 3rd party library that hasn't yet been ported, you'll probably have to stick with 2.6.<p>To accommodate this, they allow you to import almost all of the 3.0 features in 2.6 on a file-by-file basis.  So you can pretty much write code in Python 2.6 as if it was 3.0 provided you do the necessary ""from __future__ import XXX"" at the top of your file to do things like make ""print"" a function rather than a language keyword, etc.  You won't have the reorganized standard library, but for most tasks there's either no difference or minor differences.<p>So yes, definitely learn Python, but be sure to install both 2.6 and 3.0.  I recommend learning with 3.0, but you may have to do ""real"" projects in 2.6 for some time.",1228401462

385670,comment,384637,384752,0,0,daniel_yokomizo,,,"1. Most lines of code don't require side-effects, the Haskell way just asks you to structure your program in pure parts and side effecting parts (usually 90/10).\n2. Also it's easy to define your own forms of side effects and parameterize your code on them (so I write my code to depend on any monad m that offers references and the code runs using IO, ST or STM), not being constrained by whatever choices the language designers gave you initially\n3. Monads (and arrows and other abstractions that can model side-effects) are beautiful by themselves. It's one of the most elegant ways to express, compose and restrict side-effects. In most languages there's no easy way to create different combinators to deal with side-effects, but in Haskell 'do', ';' and '<-' are only pieces of notation, the real meat is '>>=' and 'return' and whatever combinators you build upon these.\n4. The Haskell way to deal with side effects is to use a pure language to build a side-effecting program. Instead of writing down the program you abstract its parts and use combinators to mix them. 'IO' is a value that can be manipulated not an action that was already executed.",1228400101

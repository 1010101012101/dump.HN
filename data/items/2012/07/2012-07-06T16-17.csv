4208552,comment,4206673,4206954,1,0,Strilanc,,,"Super simplified summary: because the probabilities can interfere with each other in controlled ways.<p>Bits vs Qubits<p>Suppose you have 3 bits, but you don't know what state they are in. Could be 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, or 111. There is a probability of the state being each of those possibilities. However, the bits are actually in one of these states. Any operation you perform, like 'increment', will take one fixed input and give one fixed output.<p>Now suppose you have 3 qubits, but you don't know what state they are in. Could be 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, or 111. There is a probability of the state being each of those possibilities. However, the probability is derived from a ""magnitude"" or ""amplitude"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude</a>) which sortof actually physically exists. The bits are not in exactly one of the states. They ""really"" have an amplitude/probability.<p>Ok, whatever, so the probabilities are ""magnitudes"" and ""actually exist"". How does that help? Well ... you can perform operations that 'rotate' the magnitudes in ways that make them interfere with each other in ways that give the right answer more and more magnitude as you iterate. Keep in mind these rotations are over a <i>huge</i> number of magnitudes (2^n) but their running times are polynomial in the number of qubits (n).

4208532,comment,4205553,4206042,1,0,wes-exp,,,"What about creating a system of income-based drug pricing? If done correctly, this wouldn't even hurt profits... it would maximize them. And, everyone gets treated. Win/win.<p>Note that pharma companies already try to do this (because price discrimination does maximize profits), but they break pricing down by country. Countries with low per-capita income are charged less. But this neglects low-income people living in high per-capita income countries like the US; just because you live in the US does not mean you can afford the highest price. A pricing system based on individual incomes would solve this.<p>Furthermore, individualized pricing would help to limit the offshoring of jobs. Consider that an auto worker in the US has to pay the full US price for medication, but an auto worker in China only has to pay the price in China, which is undoubtedly lower. Therefore, the current system of nation-based pricing distorts economic incentives and unnecessarily encourages the offshoring of jobs. But a system of individual income-based pricing would correct this, and make US auto workers more competitive with their foreign competition.",1341593576

4208526,comment,4207572,4208450,11,0,pbh,,,"This is a great description of R usage (import, clean, fit models), but I think a slightly erroneous explanation of R history.<p>John Chambers created ""S"" at Bell Labs.  S was a programming language designed for interactive statistical analysis.  Much like gcc and icc are implementations of C compilers, R and S-PLUS are implementations of S.  S-PLUS was/is the primary proprietary implementation of the S language, whereas R is the primary free one (also, sometimes called GNU S).  (SAS and SPSS are completely different languages/systems as far as I know.)  I think that statisticians at some point made a conscious effort to publish their work in R, rather than S-PLUS (or any other statistical system like SAS) because it was more widely available.  That in turn led R to be a viable competitor to S-PLUS (and other systems) because it had vast amounts of recent statistical libraries, often implemented by the people who developed the techniques.  That said, SAS and SPSS seem to pretty much still have social science students locked up --- the market for R is probably statisticians who are also excellent functional programmers.<p>This history is in really marked contrast to MATLAB and its corresponding free version Octave, where computer scientists pretty much refuse to use Octave, despite MATLAB's massive price tag to pretty much everyone involved (even with 90% discounts).<p>(That said, if anyone lived through the change over from S-PLUS to R, I'd love to hear if this history is wrong!)",1341593509

It's a special-purpose language made to do a specific task.<p>The general workflow for doing data analysis is 1) import the data 2) clean it and format it properly as input for a pre-built package that does the actual analysis 3) feed it to the package and 4) interpret the results.<p>To that end, typically R programs are short and pretty declarative. R packages contain C or FORTRAN extensions that do all the heavy lifting. Substantial amount of imperative R code is going to be slow. For instance, looping over a vector is always worse than applying a vector transformation, and R provides a rich set of transformations for all its data types.<p>R has gotten popular because the proprietary guys dropped the ball at the universities. I recall reading a posting by one researcher who said he switched to R because his students could only use SAS at the school's stats lab, whereas they could run R on their computers at home.<p>Once researchers switched to R, they started publishing their work with code meant to be run with R. The cutting edge is important in stats, so people want a short lead time between when a new test or model is published and when it's available. SAS's ""cathedral"" can't really keep up. Combine that with SAS's licensing costs (both arms and a kidney too) as well as its overall ""mainframey"" feel, and you can see why R is winning.<p>EDIT: Another big win for R that I forgot to mention is its support for visualizations. A step that should perhaps come after importing the data above is investigating it with various diagnostic charts (scatter charts, box charts, etc) these are all just function calls in R. In addition, R has a powerful graphics engine and there are a huge number of packages available to create more sophisticated visualizations: <a href=""http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/</a>",1341592240

The network effect is already pretty powerful and only gets stronger. AirBNB has done all the work to polish the experience, and hosts are making money using the site. That's very sticky. On top of that, as a guest, you now know that there's nowhere you can go to get a bigger selection (which co-incidentally, gets bigger everyday) of reputable hosts. Same is true for hosts, with the added benefit that guests are insured.<p>> just like the Groupon copycats, it'll be worth it for copycats to ""buy"" users to gain market share.<p>Whatever the copycats can pay, AirBnB can pay more, and even then, the hosts have no incentive to switch from AirBnB to something else. They might list elsewhere, but as long as more guests are coming through AirBnB, they wont cancel their AirBnB accounts.<p>Fundamentally - AirBnB enabled people to monetize something that lay fallow before.

It's a desperate attempt to co-opt the Red Hat approach to riches via open source support.   Revolution R has been doing pretty well in this game, so Oracle is replicating. The only contribution back to the community so far has been to do a few mild updates to ROracle, the R to Oracle connector.<p>Oracle has basically wrapped up R and made it embedded in the Database.  One nice touch is that they have made overloaded versions of most of R's base and stat functions, and let them handle the ""ore"" dataframes; these overloaded versons are basically  wrappers on the ""big-data"" functions inside the DB.<p>If this is really interesting to you, here are a set of PDFs describing Oracles approach: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-analytics/r-enterprise/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-...</a><p>Bad news is: you are limited to Oracle approaches to scale and growth; while there's some to love, there's also lots to hate.<p>I worry that some of this commercialization of R is going to cause trouble, as we start having non-compatible forks of R creating non-replicable analyses.

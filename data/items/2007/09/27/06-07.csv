Those with ultimate say over whether FB is worth $X billion are those who buy and sell $X billion companies, in whole or significant part. That includes people advising and courting FB, who know a lot about its internals, prospects, and strategic value. <p>As Swisher notes, a few months ago, when speculation centered on a $6 billion valuation, she suggested in that range, Zuckerberg would be a 'fool' to not take the money and run. Well, if the latest WSJ report is to be trusted, now valuations over $10 billion are on the table. So what was the foolish advice?",1190875968

""Thinking about x uses brain system y, therefore [some outrageous claim].""<p>In this case, you seem to be suggesting that the brain activity proves ""both types of morality are wired into us,"" but that doesn't follow at all.  Brain activity doesn't tell us whether utilitarianism or the categorical imperative accurately model what is really happening in the brain, or whether the corresponding thoughts and behaviors are innate or learned.",1190875589

It saddens me to see your operation come down to you deciding to leave it for a job. To keep it business running, I would try to get another coder, tell the marketing guy to focus on current products, not future side projects. Take control of the company...basically what everyone else has been saying. ",1190874539

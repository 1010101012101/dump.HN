4731593,comment,4729068,4729877,4,0,mikk0j,,,"For me, this perfectly sums up the futility of the Strong AI / AGI research project. So much of what we consider to be 'intelligence' or repercussions of intelligence are in fact language-based communications and culture - with an immense genetical legacy, bias, and quite frankly, burden. To create human-equivalent intelligence, most or indeed all of these evolutionary biases would have to be built in.<p>Consider a different example: constructing artificial vision. Human vision is the result of evolution, of course. It is incredibly inefficient, but evolution is blind (sorry). When we now construct computer vision, we capture an optical image and transmit it optically as long as possible, since this preserves information. The human eye does not: it sends information via neurons to the visual cortex, compromising immensely in bandwidth. That's why we need visual error-correction mechanisms in the brain, and redundancy of visual information (achieved by the eye moving rapidly many times per second, for example).<p>When we construct optical computer vision that achieves the a similar thing as human vision, the two have nothing in common. You can't plug in the artificial front end into the biological back end. The two systems produce literally different images, that are not comparable. The systems will not communicate with each other. We have skipped the legacy of biological evolution completely. To create an artificial system that accurately corresponds to the biological would be an immense waste.<p>The same goes for intelligence. Our 'wet' evolved intelligence is an entirely different picture from the project of Strong AI. They will produce very different manifestations of interacting with the world. Why would the latter ever result in the illusion of free will or the self-referentiality of personal identity, two things we assume are parts of human-level intelligence? They are like the neurological channels for conveying an optical image: hopelessly inefficient, but the ones that make sense in the light of our evolutionary legacy.<p>As a side note, yes we know of a time when there was no language, but it not a good representation to consider that a binary switch. We know of complex communication between other animals, and given that even current languages are in rapid flux, I think it is is fair to think of the transition from pre-language to language a continuum. Language is still arising.",1351839477

If you call that amazing thinking, I'd hate to see the idiotic version.<p>Even better:<p>> <i>Geoffrey Sampson maintains that universal grammar theories are not falsifiable and are therefore pseudoscientific theory. He argues that the grammatical ""rules"" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language. Similarly, Jeffrey Elman argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by Universal Grammar is based on a too-strict, ""worst-case"" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a language acquisition device (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an explanandum looking for theories.<p>Sampson, Roediger, Elman and Hurford are hardly alone in suggesting that several of the basic assumptions of Universal Grammar are unfounded. Indeed, a growing number of language acquisition researchers argue that the very idea of a strict rule-based grammar in any language flies in the face of what is known about how languages are spoken and how languages evolve over time. For instance, Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see the distributional hypothesis). It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if we assume that children employ similarity-based generalization strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.<p>Another way of defusing the poverty of the stimulus argument is to assume that if language learners notice the absence of classes of expressions in the input, they will hypothesize a restriction (a solution closely related to Bayesian reasoning). In a similar vein, language acquisition researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit negative feedback that allows them to correct their errors over time. This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of fast mapping, as many nativists assume.<p>Finally, in the domain of field research, the Pirah language is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of Universal Grammar. This research has been primarily led by Daniel Everett, a former Christian missionary. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for recursion, including embedded clauses, as well as quantifiers and color terms. Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of Universal Grammar.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar#Criticisms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar#Criticisms</a><p>Looks like I'm not the only one that sees through bullshit.<p>Let me repeat - just to imprint on people's minds:<p>> <i>This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of fast mapping, as many nativists assume.</i><p>Chomsky's theories are, and always were, DOA.",1351838818

4731552,comment,4730158,4730158,7,0,EGreg,,,"Here are a few reasons why the patent system isn't useful for software:
A) Almost no one in the industry comes up with innovative solutions to problems by reading software patents from the last 20 years. They do it by implementing their own solutions or improving existing solutions.<p>B) There is already a powerful force that has promoted innovation in software much more than patents, and that is open source. In fact, most of the web sites on the internet are powered by a stack of open source software. Therefore, innovation would take place in this industry even if the government didn't offer a 20 year monopoly to anyone who can disclose a non obvious idea to the public.<p>C) The purpose of patents is to promote innovation by encouraging the inventor to disclose the details of the intention to the public, in exchange for a 17-20 year monopoly on the implementation of the invention. However, since the industry moves so fast, inventions which are not obvious when patented become extremely obvious ""incremental improvements"" several years later. This combined with A completely defeats the positive side (to the public) of the compromise, but keeps the negative side of the compromise -- namely the monopoly. The latter costs society in the form of litigations, intimidation of small companies, and injunctions against useful products made by big corporations.<p>D) Software patents encourage patent trolls to file an invention and lie in wait, or sell the patent to someone who will lie in wait. Meanwhile, they discourage actually implementing technology, because it can infringe on any number of patented inventions. We all realize how much implementation and execution is more important than a mere idea. Thus, it might actually be thwarting the very thing that it's supposed to promote: actual implementation. In the words of Fred Wilson, it is a ""tax on innovation"".<p>E) By contrast, open source encourages actual IMPLEMENTORS of software to not only disclose the effect to the public, but release a functional piece of software which actually implements the innovations. Moreover, many Free Software licenses compel those who make use of this software to release their own software in turn. The result is people building on each other's work, promoting implementation and execution over simply disclosing ideas. This aligns much better with the interests of society at large -- and the original purpose for patents.<p>F) The industry moves too fast for the patent office to keep up not only with the state of the art (they have almost no chance), but even the state of PRIOR ART, leading to many patents being granted that don't satisfy the obviousness or prior art requirements. Sometimes dozens of patents are approved for the exact same thing. As a result, the cost to society is pushed into the legal sector, causing lengthy court proceedings rather than patent office actions.<p>G) When a small company is sued, even by a patent which can be invalidated, it can often be intimidated into entering a settlement (an unfair situation), or in fact defeated because it didn't have the funds to find the prior art. But even in cases where there was no prior art and the patented invention was in fact not obvious, chances are 99% of the time the ""infringing"" implementation was developed completely unaware of the patent's existence. See points A, and C. Therefore, the positive side of the compromise (to the public) was completely superfluous, but the negative side hits with full force and effect (see point F).<p>H) Large companies now spend billions of dollars to acquire patent portfolios for purposes of intimidation, defense against ... patent litigation, and anticompetitive practices -- by which I mean not competing on actual quality and price of the products, but rather trying to artificially reduce the quality and increase the price of the competing products. The costs to the consumer are obvious. Moreover, the costs to shareholders include money that will never be used for actual innovation, but simply the above purposes.<p>All in all, there are many reasons to abolish software patents in the USA.",1351838396

Some of these emails were from Facebook, and included links to resources that require login. These links pre-populated the username field for convenience, or in some cases auto-login the user. Facebook's engineers probably did not anticipate email notifications to users being crawled by Google. Live and learn, eh?<p>But could Facebook have done something to prevent or minimize the damage caused by these leaked emails?<p>1. Lets start with the auto-login links, as those are the scariest. Do those links use one-time-use tokens, and do the tokens expire? If either or both of those steps was skipped it makes this leak much more serious, and speaks to negligence or disrespect for user security. If Facebook has both of those security measures in place, though, they did all they realistically could. If somebody lets their private email get indexed by Google (seriously, though, how does that even happen??), that's their own problem.<p>2. The other class of leaked urls link email addresses to Facebook profiles. This isn't as immediately scary, and for a lot of people it wouldn't even matter. But it is easy to imagine scenarios where this kind of privacy would be important to someone, and this kind of leak would be just as scary as someone being able to log in as them. Frankly, I never would have thought of securing this, and I doubt Facebook did anything to secure it. Going forward, though, it would probably be worth it for them to link auto-username-populating through one-time-use, expiring tokens as well.<p>So, it looks like Facebook probably got hit with a bizarre edge case privacy / security issue. There are likely things they could do to make their system more resistant to this kind of thing, but at the same time they probably didn't do as badly as this might make them look at first glance.<p>Again, this is speculation, any confirmation or disconfirmation would be great.",1351837222

Engine braking + looking ahead to see when I need to lift = I seldom need to replace brakes. And my driving is quite spirited. (I go through brakes far slower than does my wife, who doesn't drive with as much zest, but accelerates towards red lights, etc.)<p>2. Yeah. It'd be nice to not have to worry about oil changes. But besides that, good modern drivetrains are incredibly reliable.<p>3. Not if it's engineered well. There are sports cars that can be driven hard for the better part of a decade with nothing but oil, filter, and tire changes. (This is from experience.) Sure, there are plenty of lousy sports cars out there, but the causes of their poor reliability are more rooted in lousy engineering than in their having internal combustion engines.",1351836921

1. Make a stupid status update post.
2. It appears in all your friends newsfeed.
3. You realize you said something stupid and private.
4. Panic. Delete post
5. Breathe sigh of relief that it is no longer showing up in your profile.
6. But wait a minute! It still keeps showing up in all your friends newsfeed.
7. Now that you deleted the post, you can't even modify it's visibility settings. Heck you can't even get to the url. But all your friends continue to see the post in their newsfeeds<p>So the way facebook implements a delete of any activity(status post/like/comment) is that the owner stops seeing it but everyone else keeps seeing it.

Some providers will validate the number you want to announce, and prevent you from announcing a number that they don't think you should be using. Others don't care at all. There are a <i>lot</i> of different telecom service providers, so finding one with lax policies isn't hard.<p>Almost anyone who is actually operating a phone card business has all the equipment needed to do this, for example. Phone cards are incredibly competitive, so if you head over to your local telecom hotel you won't have much trouble finding people willing to take your money in exchange for steady business.<p>The next time you are in a data center, take some time to talk to the people messing with the funky gear that doesn't look like any firewall or router you've ever seen.",1351836113

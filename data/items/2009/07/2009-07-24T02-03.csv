It was about linking together with my dorm-mates, writing silly things on each other's walls (which were just overwriteable textareas), and generally wasting time.

No, my claim was that the current economic crisis, however severe it becomes, will not make starvation typical in the United States. It is atypical now, it was atypical during the Great Depression, and it will continue to be atypical everywhere where people can trade freely and participate in economic exchange without government interference. The last mass famine in a country that should have had climate and agricultural advantages enough to prevent famine was in China, during the Great Leap Forward (around the time I was born).

when my iphone's mic inexplicably died, the apple store just replaced the unit.  I swung by a store, they confirmed the broken hardware, grabbed a new device, swapped the sim card and i went home and restored from my backup. it took 10 minutes in the store and 10 more at home.<p>when my 360 died, microsoft left it up to their partner (best buy).  who hassled me about their absurd return policy despite my having purchased their extended service plan that clearly covered the situation.  after a frustrating experience that required forty-five minutes of my time and escalation past the first tier of management, i did get new hardware.<p>I then got home and found out that the XBox Live content i'd purchased was tied to my old (now-dead) hardware.  If i didn't have an active internet connection, it couldn't be used on the new hardware.  Most times I'm connected, so it wasn't a -huge- deal -- but it still bit me in the ass a few times until Microsoft released their fix for the DRM situation (18 months later).<p>To sum-up: the value Apple offers isn't in the hardware specs.  It's in the single point of responsibility, excellent customer service and lack of bullshit.<p>I don't know a single person who fits the straw man of 'buying apple to be cool'.

This excludes about 99.725 percent of the population.  Proprietary code people are less rare.<p>So one of the reasons I chose to modify zentu.net's tagline from a ""FOSS""-oriented tagline to an ""OSS""-oriented one is precisely that . . . I admire Stallman's and Torvalds' benevolences and all, but people cannot work for free.  FOSS is too often misclassified (by the MS camp) as being cheap, when in actuality it is just as valuable as proprietary.  Anybody who wants to can get into any code base and can contribute value; it's totally binary.  So I have to agree with Torvalds here.<p>Although I've never really ""hated"" Microsoft, I have felt really robbed by its lack of payment or even acknowledgment to me for all of my hours of service on their systems.

Operations on patch queues are somewhat lower level than, say, git's rebase, but all the power is still there (and there's a rebase extension which will let you do it all in one go if that's your thing).<p>What's been interesting to me is seeing the evolution of the ""popular"" git workflow over time. Originally, people hyped things like rebasing and editing commit history, but gradually the emphasis has shifted away from that and the best practices have solidified around using those features only when they're necessary, which is much less often than a lot of folks originally believed. And, amusingly, that's <i>very</i> close to the way hg has always been used: you <i>can</i> do lots of fancy stuff, but you should have a good reason for doing so (and should typically never do so after you've pushed to other folks or they've pulled from you).",1248402250

To put it bluntly, you are wrong (particularly paragraph 1 sentence 1 and paragraph 3, mutability).<p>I'm not sure how you have arrived at Lisp being your ad hoc definition of functional programming, but it frightens me.<p>The main issue here is that the article isn't saying that only the lambda calculus is functional programming but it is saying that the whole paradigm is based on the lambda calculus and so to determine how functional a language is, you determine how similar it is to the lambda calculus.<p>Wikipedia on functional programming:<p>""Functional programming has its roots in the lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as embellishments to the lambda calculus.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming</a>",1248400802

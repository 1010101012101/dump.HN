I do mostly Java and Open Source stuff like Python and Perl w/ Postgres.  For me, Linux and OSX are about tied for most productive, with Windows coming in a close second.  For the price, I think you'd be best off with Linux.<p>Having said that, I am a bit of a Mac fanboy, so they can pry my MacBook Pro at my current job from my cold, unemployed fingers.  :)",1224457147

Mobile carriers are stingy.  Unless it's got a usability factor of ""wow, this is something I really need to be using daily"", you're going to have a hard time getting the use out of it.<p>SMS, by the nature of how it's currently being controlled is going to have a high barrier to entry as far as creating services goes.<p>Good luck.",1224456973

I think when your ""big change"" is that the body of the laptop is built out of one piece of aluminium (as Ive prounouces it), then you might be in trouble. The average consumer does not care about that.<p>The competition has figured out that design and weight matter and as a result has produced some pretty nice looking, very portable machines... for a lot less.<p>I personally am sticking with my iMac/Macbook, however as price becomes more of a factor, I think that negatively impacts apple.",1224456800

337348,comment,337080,337080,0,0,furiouslol,,,"I think it's time to dismiss one of the falsehoods perpetuated by MSM and this article: that the main reason why the credit market is seizing is because banks do not trust each other.... wrong! the real reason is they either don't have any spare cash or that they have no more risk appetite to lend.<p>The UK market would make for a good case. With interbank lending guarantee by the govt, you would expect the credit markets to resume flowing, but it has not materialized. The banks have made a decision to lend less and deleverage.<p>So don't expect the capital injection by Paulson to make the banks start lending. They won't. Which is why the Fed will have to go into the markets and be the direct lender (which is what they did in the commercial paper market)",1224456315

I have never known a regulator to want less power, so libertarians are fighting a lost cause.</i><p>I don't think that's fair. I think <i>the public's</i> opinion is being reflected from the sentiment in the public debate around the world. Politicians, central bankers, academics, big name investors, etc. The specifics of interventions (proposed laws for bailouts) have been supported by public figures usually on the libertarian side of the policy (eg Rupert Murdoch). It's true, they've still stuck to their respective positions: John McCain is still more of a libertarian then Obama, Hugo Chavez hasn't moved much, etc. Die hards are still dies hards. But, the whole debate has shifted left.<p>This is very likely to bring with it other changes. I complain about people looking at the political spectrum simplistically just like anyone else. Left on A shouldn't mean left on B. But in reality, these things seem to be associated.",1224456016

You gotta break some eggs if you want to make an omelette.<p><i>9. Make your team friendly. If there is a socially akward or shy guy who does not relate with the other members of the team, fire him</i><p>It's actionable discrimination and a shitty thing to do to an otherwise valuable but shy person, but he's too shy to bring this to your attention or to hire a lawyer, so it's a win-win.

It makes the relations with the professors easier.<p>I've been looking for ways to move storage and bandwidth to AWS, but just set up my own personal account with JungleDisk a couple of weeks ago. What utilities do you recommend for shifting webserver stuff to AWS? What can be pushed?

Of course there are many variables to consider in this dilemma, but I didn't want to make the post too long.<p>As for our roles in the startup, he is a web developer, I'm a mathematician/developer, so we complement each other. Just the two of us, at least for the coming couple of months. The idea that I'm getting, already in this phase of preparing for the startup, is this: in a startup, there's always work to be done and you get bonus points if you iterate fast. So that kind of mitigates the factor if somebody is a good multitasker or not (I'm more of a believer in focus).",1224454169

For web graphics its really all about Illustrator, and maybe InDesign if you want to get into layouts - they're almost the same, but InDesign is geared more towards print so you get a lot more visual queues for object placement, etc. I would go with Illustrator though, and with growing browser support for the SVG format knowing how to create vector images will become an increasingly important skill for developers/designers.<p>If you just want something to touch up photos, GIMP is pretty good and free. Its like an older version of Photoshop. If I just need to fix the color balance or crop an image, I usually find myself opening up GIMP just to knock it out quickly.<p>With any of these programs, its good to spend time playing around (sometimes known as practice), and then you'll have a better basis for understanding the more in-depth features.

The wide availability of cheap desktop publishing software could have made design as a profession vanish because it gave people the ability to do it themselves.<p>But that didn't happen. Instead, people did try it themselves and the market was flooded with extremely poor design. Before, not having a logo at all was the floor, the absolute minimum of branding. But after DTP, the floor was raised - having a poorly-designed logo that you did yourself was the new minimum. Today, crowdsourced logo that you paid $300 for is rapidly becoming the new minimum.<p>Nothing changes for designers, because there is no ceiling. Thinking of design in the very narrow, branding sense: it cannot be commodified, because whenever the minimum level is raised, it becomes ubiquitous and generic, and that creates the new zero point. Designers get paid to design things to stand out from what's ubiquitous, whatever that happens to be at the time.",1301946161

It's a completely JavaScript front end with much of the design of the interface done by me in Edit Room itself.<p>Drop your email in the form if you like, but if you don't care to hear more about this in the future from me, you can still check out the prototype by following the direct link below the form.<p>Next steps are to accept paid users (bootstrap FTW!) and provide the ability to save screens, semantically markup the generated html, and integrate multiple screens into an entire website.  Also coming are nested sequences, animated masks, and whatever else CSS brings to the table.  I've only implemented a relatively small set of possible CSS features so far, but it's enough to do useful work already.<p>NB: Since the animation engine is completely dependent on the CSS3 Animation spec, browsers that don't implement that spec cannot yet use this tool :(  I'm looking at an alternate animation engine that sequences CSS Transitions (remarkably similar concept to Firmin), but it's not there yet.  Priorities are those listed above.<p>Comments welcome!  Would love to hear from animators and visual designers especially - what is missing here that would get in the way of you doing all your web design work in a tool like this?<p>Thanks!<p>Kevin",1301946101

Am I misunderstanding the reason for COW?<p>Also, the most important characteristic to me is latency. I don't care about throughput that much as long as it's ""good enough"", hardware is getting really cheap really quickly anyway (in terms of cores and RAM/$). Latency on the other hand is tough. While IO is normally going to be the biggest factor here, if the runtime allows me to consistently shave 5ms off of every request - that's still a great improvement. In this sense i would say that raw speed IS important to me.<p>Perhaps I haven't encountered the use cases Ian is talking about, it was difficult to figure them out from the blog post (i'm a relative novice in Python).<p>But I am hoping PyPy can at some point help with the concerns I have above, even lower latency by itself may be compelling enough to switch.",1301945743

I'm not an Objective-C guy in the least, but am reasonably good with JS, so it's a great way to go native.<p>That said, some comments:
- JS Warnings.  It's true that one-line ifs, property existence checks, function closure suggestions, etc. can get a little annoying.  My solution is to write JS which is 100% JSLint compatible, which is fair IMO.<p>- Titanium Warnings.  These get annoying.  I get dozens of ""[object TiUIView] has an auto height value of 0, meaning this view may not be visible"" warnings which are completely useless and don't identify the offending View for me to fix.  Also, I get about a dozen errors like ""<Error>: CGContextDrawImage: invalid context 0x0"" which give me no indication which is the offending image.  Etc.<p>- Performance.  While native, our application runs a little sluggish and certain views are choppy when scrolling, and some style properties have bizarre rendering behaviour (layout: 'horizontal', width / height: 'auto', etc)<p>- Minor Revisions.  The author is right, some minor revisions introduce pretty bad issues.  1.6.0 introduced some very noticeable performance degradations in TableViews, so we're still on 1.5.1 for now.<p>- Documentation needs work.  The API reference is lacking any mention of certain parameters, which is frustrating.  The wiki has more detailed information and has essential reads to understand things like TableViews, but I didn't find this resource for several weeks into my project.  Many undocumented side-effects exist, like quirky behaviour on horizontal layouts, etc.  Here's an example of the kind of confusion which results: <a href=""https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238/tickets/1437-horizontal-layout-broken-on-ipad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238/ticket...</a>  The ""headerPullView"" feature for pull-to-refresh is currently undocumented magic.<p>- Barcode support is disappointing.  Titanium+ introduced Barcode support, but does not support the usual 1D barcode.  The additional libraries that exist (TiBar, zbar, etc.) are very difficult to compile in without XCode hackery, and sometimes don't work on the devices themselves, making debugging very difficult.<p>- Bugs in XHR with Content-Type and passing Arrays, requiring workarounds when integrating with Rails.  Arrays get sent as ""(   key1: value1\n   key2: value2\n)\n"" .. seriously :)<p>- Titanium Developer required me to click ""Launch"" to start the application until I read Gene Tsai's comment on the original article which gives you command-line aliases to start your application.  Awesome tip :)<p>At the end of the day, Titanium Mobile is a great solution, but be prepared to be patient while the platform matures, and to get creative in architecting alternate solutions when your initial approach doesn't work.  I'm confident the wrinkles I point out above will be ironed out in time.",1301945204

Sadly they seem too focused on spending VC cash on adding bells in whistles when their core functionality still doesn't work.

(The amis is the derogatory German term.)<p>Two months ago I had lunch with him, another former Wehrmacht soldier and three women from that generation.  The other guy was extremely rude.  He said many derogatory things about Americans and American prisoner of war camp guards (my dad was such a guard after the war).  I don't speak German and didn't know about this until after the dinner when my girlfriend interpreted for me.<p>I was pissed at her for not letting me know what he said until after he left.  She didn't want a scene to be caused.  No one in the group said anything to the man or to correct him or to say that he was full of shit.  They all kept cheerfully engaged in conversation.<p>What's amazing to me is that the great crime of that generation was silence.  Few spoke out against racist talk.  Few stood up against foolish rantings.  Sixty years later here was a group of Germans from that generation still afraid to speak up.  Still afraid of causing a scene (and my girlfriend too!).<p>It was absolutely shocking.  I was really pissed because my dad had died a few weeks earlier and it was hard to hear this stuff from the likes of these people.  No Wehrmacht soldier has the right to call another uncivilized and he did call Americans uncivilized.<p>The whole thing caused me to reflect a lot.  It's something I'll never forget.  My girlfriend's generation suffers from what I call ""the German guilt thing"".  Her father's generation doesn't seem to have ever come to grips with what they did.<p>This is all anecdotal of course.  But in my dealings with other Germans it's clear to me that Germans on a whole do think they are better (or their way of life is better) than anyone else.  They won't say this anymore but deep down there appears to be an ""uber alles"" bent.<p>Other people have different experiences and come to different conclusions than me.  This is all just my opinion.  I guess the crux of what I'm saying is that it is easy to feel superior and such arrogance isn't limited to Americans.  There are lots of examples in the history of the world of such thinking.  It's bad whenever it occurs and the worst form of it is to ignore it in your culture while condemning it in other cultures.",1301944997

But such an approach devolves into pop pablum.<p>I believe most other ideas here would be unnecessary if the meaning of the up/down arrows could be resolved either socially or algorithmically.<p>The ""correct"" solution would be to offer a quadrant, with contributes/detracts on one axis, and agree/disagree on the other.  But that would require a rewrite.<p>Instead of a rewrite, I'd experiment with temporarily changing the arrows to say something explicitly supporting well reasoned comments:<p><pre><code>  17 points by uptown 1 hour ago [ contributes | detracts ] link | parent | flag
</code></pre>
Some would undoubtedly still interpret these as a rightness axis like ""agree/disagree"", so perhaps an even more familiar pair of terms:<p><pre><code>  17 points by uptown 1 hour ago [ content | spam ] link | parent | flag
</code></pre>
However, the term ""content"" might lead to voting up every valid content remark, so the positive word should be something with more of a value judgment, while still being a word that can apply to points of view with which one disagrees:<p><pre><code>  17 points by uptown 1 hour ago | interesting* | spam | link | parent | flag
</code></pre>
The idea with the vocabulary choice is that a neutral comment would not be clicked on, and ""interesting"" is directly in the HN charter.<p>I think this type of vocabulary is more in line with the desire to see well reasoned or contributory discussion flourish.<p>* Mouse over the word ""interesting"" could tooltip: ""This comment made me think.""<p>// This account is ~400 days old, but a prior anonymous account is ~800 days old, giving some perspective on the trend over time.",1301944307

Or you could imagine a bitcoin2.org that generates more coins. Or you could hope for a massive surge in the value of the bitcoin.<p>I'd put my money on Paypal sticking around, though.",1301943710

Just for example - the neutron weapons deployed in Europe several decades ago were of very low yield, as low as it is possible with fissile-fusion weapon - their purpose was to stop Soviet Union tanks as intense neutron flux passes easily through the armor, yet is absorbed nicely by humans as we're 80% water.<p>>I have a hard time believing that a fusion power source would work at all like a fusion bomb.<p>No need to. The only thing what matters is the amount of neutrons generated. High intensity flux during 10-30sec. instead of super-high during 0.001ms explosion would do the same damage if the total amount of neutrons generated is the same.<p>I mentioned Sandia because what they do (more precisely what they did 10 years ago) was the most effective and promising way to get effective fusion - for energy generation as well as to weaponize it without fission part, and i think it is illustrative to look at them to see how progress has stalled (more precisely it was redirected from advancing of the engineering of the fusion into more plasma research) when it became that clear.",1301943689

They provide information, but their tone is generally exactly what people are worried about Hacker News turning into. Annoyingly, I've seen a few cases in the past where TechCrunch's post have gotten more upvotes than the original source's blogpost (I believe it was a Google announcement).",1301943667

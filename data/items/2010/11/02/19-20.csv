If the term multitasking is used commonly to refer to context switching, both in people and in computers, on what grounds do you disagree with its use?<p>Also, I question the scientific basis for suggesting that no one can do more than one thing at a time. My understanding is that the brain is massively parallel, so it seems likely to me that it is capable of running background processes in parallel with foreground processes. It's probably true that only one task can have conscious attention at a given time, but that doesn't mean that we can only do one thing at a time.",1288727776
1862053,comment,1860795,1860795,0,0,dasil003,,,"I'm not sure how I feel about phrase ""startup career path"" as concept.  Not that I disagree with what Gabriel is saying here, but be careful not to box yourself in conceptually.<p>I definitely consider myself an early-stage startup guy, and I am extremely hesitant to work for a large company, however I've actually only been in a true startup for 3 years out of a 12-year career.  Before that I worked for a public University, a new media agency, and a bunch of small freelance gigs.  In all of those circumstances I was able to do great work, meet great people, and learn a lot about business (yes even at the U).<p>Now it's true that nothing matches the ambition or intensity of a true startup, and it's definitely a place I like to be.  Conventional wisdom in silicon valley evolves quickly, but it's very inbred, and it tends to create bubbles of competition around sexy concepts, where hundreds or thousands of the very smartest people in the world are working 18 hour days on some specific concept that doesn't even have a market yet (eg. Check-in-base mobile apps).  Meanwhile, out in wider industries you find huge markets with huge inefficiencies due; billion dollar markets that are ripe for disruption, with reasonably small barriers to entry for someone with a little inside information.<p>If you bring your technical and execution skills to one of these markets you have a much greater chance of success, and with an established market you also can be sure there's something really there.  Spending a couple years in an established company could be the seed to a brilliant startup.  Likewise, working on yet another social widget just for the sake of being in a ""startup"" could land you with obsolete skills when app-fatigue turns to backlash, and silicon valley moves onto the next hot thing.",1288727771

Usually I visit this page 2-3 times a week just for reading.\n By forbidding new users to post the community will be divided in two classes ""the privileged one"" (those who have time to read and write comments) and ""the rest"" (no write access, because probably they do not have enough time for writing comments (my case)).<p>I think that ""classical"" approaches will minimize the spam.

If you care about the environment, vote for the green party. You won't change the outcome of the election but what you will change is the issues that the parties run on in the next election. For instance, if the Republicans lose your state by 5% but they see that the Green party won 2% of the vote, they will try to get that 2%. They will do this by adopting the Green Party's platform (third parties are usually very narrow so one of the big two can co-opt their entire platform).

The plane had been missing for more than a week. Luke, and his three sons, were returning home from a family vacation. There were no survivors.<p>Most of you probably don't know of the organization called The Nerdery (http://www.nerdery.com). They're a group of 120 nerds in Minneapolis who are technological wizards - building mobile apps, web apps, legacy apps - any app you can imagine - they've probably built it. And you've probably also seen their work out there in the interwebs, too.<p>They're also the creators and sponsors of The Overnight Website Challenge (http://overnightwebsitechallenge.com/), where once a year 10-15 development teams of 10 people each gather together to donate 24 hours of their time to build websites for local non profits. That's well over 2500 hours of hard core hacking, donated for FREE, to groups in need, every year. This organization has done good - a lot of it.<p>Most of you didn't know Luke. Some of you did. Some of you might know someone who worked at or works at The Nerdery. Some of you might actually still work at The Nerdery. Either way, Luke was a guiding force that made, makes, and will continue to make The Nerdery an awesome place to work for people who love code, technology, and all things nerdy.<p>To quote my friend and former colleague @malbiniak: ""He proved that you can build a successful business, based on passion, and maintain decency in the process. The more sincere the effort, the more genuine the return. Best. ROI. Lesson. Ever."" That defines Luke, and the team at The Nerdery.<p>I'm a relative newbie here, and realize I run the risk of getting flamed for this post. There are other tragedies in the world, all deserving of our attention - not just this one. But the dev community in Minneapolis is mourning right now, and so are members of this (Hacker News) community, and I don't really give a shit if posting here pisses someone off.<p>If it's your thing, head over to http://blog.nerdery.com or http://www.lukeandginger.com/, or follow the conversation on Twitter @ http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23LukeComeHome.<p>Also, please take a moment to read the thank you messages for the search and rescue teams involved in this effort: http://thanks.lukeandginger.com/",1288726745

It was the game equivalent of a deep-feature-set, enterprise-class product launch that simply hadn't been well-architected.<p>In APB's case, it likely <i>would</i> have been vastly preferable to launch with an MVP two or three years ago, the minimum viable product of APB being a game that's low on content but high on <i>playability</i>. Just as with non-game software, they should have concentrated on user experience first, with a small feature set, and have launched something that left the audience hungry for more, rather than deluging the player with content that isn't fun to play.<p>You gain a gaming audience's trust much faster promising that a fun and short game will get longer than promising that a long and un-fun game will get funner.",1288725041

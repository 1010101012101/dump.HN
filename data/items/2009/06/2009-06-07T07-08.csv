I'd assume that few of the founders on HN plan on donating 100% of all income they earn above the median level.""</i><p>There's a difference between believing that a classless society is a worthy goal and, noticing that one is not currently in a classless society and that being in an above average class has certain benefits, seeking to achieve an elevated class for the time being.<p>I would like to think I am a fairly strong believer in a classless post-scarcity utopia, but giving away most of what I own is not going to bring that any closer - all I'd be doing is reducing my own power to act. Better to retain it for now and use it to work towards the long term goal.<p>Sounds self-serving, maybe, but what can you do?",1244361449

645731,comment,645250,645250,0,0,apsurd,,,"I like the premise: To help non-coders make modern websites.<p>My project is similar in premise. 
I admit I haven't installed your framework but here are my thoughts.<p>I think you either are a coder or you aren't. I don't think its beneficial to have a middle road. Things like dreamweaver are said to allow anyone to ""make a website"". The kicker is you need to <i>learn</i> how to work dreamweaver. All you are doing is trading one learning curve for another. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm not saying you are trying to be dreamweaver, the example is meant to illustrate the problem with targeting non-coders and telling them ""hey you can make a website with my program"".<p>The point of all this is that since my project involves the same premise, and after thinking long and hard about it, I realize that enabling non-coders to make websites is all about the UI. If you tell a guy that is just starting with code ""hey you don't have to write any sql!!! Well he won't know what that means either way, so your proposed benefit flies right over his head.<p>I would say I am probably in your target userbase. I know how to code well enough to understand the benefits of your framework, but <i>since</i> I know how to code well enough to understand your benefits, that basically means I'm already comfortable writing sql and enlisting MVC to make things easier on me. (I use kohana). So as much as I appreciate all the work you've put into your framework to help me, I am extremely hesitant to abandon kohana and learn alchitect.<p>I guess my point is about marketing. Figure out <i>exactly</i> who you want to target, and make a product that fits their needs to the T.<p>In my case, my project targets non-coders. Therefore it must be 100% about the UI. Think of weebly.com That site is bleeding out of the nose with insane UI features.<p>I'm not saying in any way that this is your demographic, but rather to encourage you to pinpoint your customers!<p>Hope this helps.",1244361089

But I didn't grow up with friends/family who went to top schools, and growing up in eastern kentucky, my public school didn't let me know that I should be applying to ""good"" schools.<p>I think that many computer geeks grow up having a hard time fitting in at school, so they don't think that they have what it takes to go to the elite schools - especially if that geeks grows up poor in a rural setting.",1244360800

Only those from extremely wealthy families do.<p>All (yes, all) the top schools are need-blind, meaning they don't look at your financial situation when deciding whether to accept you.  A few of them (Stanford, Harvard I think) are offering completely free tuition if your parents make less than $100k.  For other situations, you typically would get around 75% of your tuition free even if your parents make over $100k a year.<p>The difference in first year average salary for an MIT grad vs. a state school grad is enough to make up that difference.",1244359886

Now it's true I hadn't search any content that triggered the filter in that time (I don't only think about that :-) ) but not long ago I was looking at what was the legality of having pornographic photos uploaded by users in a user generated content site and if it was better to filter them out systematically or wait for members to report such photos and those search wouldn't have worked on bing.<p>But as said, it's mostly an emotional argument on my part because I don't like companies to self-censor themselves when they could help the countries to become more opened..<p>I've also signed into Bing with a live account and didn't notice such a setting... maybe it's also disabled in Malaysia?

645700,comment,645000,645357,0,0,dkarl,,,"I don't know; I was a proud little kid and didn't ask for or accept help with my homework.  I think the advantages I had <i>could</i> be boiled down to culture.  I went to public junior high and high schools alongside really poor kids, though middle-class kids dominated the honors classes.  There weren't any kids that were truly upper-class; here and there a doctor's or lawyer's kid, but they were children of small-town doctors and lawyers.  The money they had wouldn't have meant much in a large city.<p>The advantages I had were basically four:<p>1.  My parents taught me to read before I went to school.  It is a cultural difference.  Some people take it for granted that the schools will teach their children to read.  Some people regard it as borderline child abuse if you don't teach your kids to read before they start preschool.  My parents were pretty chill, but I could read before I entered preschool at age four -- they took that for granted as one of their parental responsibilities.<p>2.  My father was an academic, I had early academic success, and I took it for granted that I was smarter than other kids.  That probably had two causes.  First, reading.  I was taught to read early, and everyone in my family read.  It was just something that one did.  Second, I was probably exposed to a more analytical style of discourse at home than other kids were.  So I was effectively ""smarter"" when it came to academic stuff, though stupider at other stuff.<p>3.  I had middle-class expectations.  Of <i>course</i> I was going to college and going to enter a smart-person profession.  I couldn't understand why other kids didn't glom on to that possibility as soon as it was presented to them.  Why did other, less enjoyable, more painful prospects seem more probable or more natural to them?  I could see an easy path for them to lots of different things:  a college education, a good job, maybe a professional degree.  They weren't stupid, but they seemed to assume a ""stupid person"" fate for themselves.  It baffled me.  This difference is also cultural.  It wasn't a physical or systemic barrier that somebody placed in front of them.  It was a barrier that was psychologically engrained in them.<p>4.  I understood how school and college worked.  Actually, I didn't really.  I didn't know that you could ask for extensions and so forth.   I didn't know you could ask professors for help; I thought only obnoxious stupid bimbos did that.  I could have known these things if I had asked my dad, but I didn't.  But I <i>did</i> know that you were supposed to study and read and turn in all your work on time, and you were supposed to read beyond the assigned work if you wanted to do really well.  And I knew you couldn't trust other people or do what was ""normal"" because a lot of people were going to fail and fall by the wayside.  That cynicism, I'm convinced, would save a lot of people.  A lot of people are good enough, smart enough, disciplined enough, etc. but at some point naively follow the example of someone they shouldn't.  I knew better than that.  You do the work, you read, you do better than everybody else because half of them are going to fail.  That isn't intellectual knowledge or insider information:  that is a cultural attitude, a different but equally important form of knowledge.<p>So yes, culture is a huge deal.  My culture was ""better"" in the sense that it resulted in a more secure, freer existence for me.<p><i>I really don’t think that the ability of professors’ kids growing up to be lawyers or doctors really says all that much about overall “social mobility.”</i><p>It says social mobility can be achieved with no social connections and only a modest amount of money.  It says social mobility is socially and economically within the grasp of a huge number of people who miss out for other reasons, and those other reasons are cultural.",1244358416

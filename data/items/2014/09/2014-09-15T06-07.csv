8317594,comment,8314354,8315832,1,0,icu,,,"Congrats on passing CFA Level 1, however I would politely ask that you consider that valuation is an art and not a science.  I have done lots of work valuing illiquid shares, for example series A in tech companies, as well as established SME businesses.  Of course this is a whole different game to valuing publicly listed liquid stocks and their options--which I trade.  I also respectfully reject that the best answer to &quot;what is something worth?&quot; is &quot;whatever someone will pay&quot;.  I know it sounds similarly cryptic but my answer is, &quot;it depends&quot;.  Therefore IMHO it&#x27;s best not to get stuck in one point of view but to try different methods and techniques for estimating value.  Some people might say, &quot;build it top down and bottom up&quot; but I say, &quot;build it from all sides&quot;.  By doing this you get a &#x27;range of value&#x27;.  There would be valid arguments for the price within the range and different buyers will sit on the continuum.  I know this is obvious, but if you are an entrepreneur your job would be to convince a buyer to give you the highest premium possible.<p>Relating all this back to the post, I&#x27;d say that this entrepreneur is trying to do just that... Basically trying to give arguments for as high a valuation as possible.<p>This is why I believe comments giving an exact figure of $x are invalid insomuch that your method for answering &quot;what something is worth&quot; is not the optimal approach.",1410764322

8317588,comment,8316230,8317424,2,0,MertsA,,,"I&#x27;m sure you probably know most of this but as a brief refresher for other viewers, here&#x27;s the basic process. So when you want to buy a SSL cert for yourdomain.com you first generate your private key yourself securely on your computer and don&#x27;t share this private key with any third party ever. You then need to prove that you really are the owner of yourdomain.com and that the new key you just made really is the legitimate key for your site. The way you do this is by creating a certificate signing request that includes your public key and the domain that you want to use that key with. You then need to get a certificate authority to sign a certificate that says that anyone going to yourdomain.com can use your new public key until 2016.<p>The big problem with this is that even though nobody knows your private key, they don&#x27;t know your public key either, they have to rely on knowing the CA&#x27;s public key and accept whatever public key they get when they connect so long as the CA says that the key is kosher. So let&#x27;s say the NSA wants to track what you&#x27;re doing on yourdomain.com, they just send a secret court order to VeriSign saying that they must turn over their private key that they use to sign certificates because computer security is a terrorist threat. Now they just use their own public key and send you a cert signed by VeriSign saying that the NSA key is the correct key to use. Because the NSA has more or less priviledged network access they can intercept traffic going to the IP address for yourdomain.com and just do a standard MITM but replacing the good SSL cert with their bad one.<p>What complicates things further is that there are tons and tons of CAs out there that are trusted by default and there&#x27;s no isolation (AFAIK) such as &quot;only these 10 CAs can sign certs for .com&quot; so when the Iranian government wants to dish out some Orwellian justice on it&#x27;s citizens they now have that huge mountain of targets to choose from because getting into one CA in the world (like DigiNotar) means that they can essentially break vanilla SSL until that CA&#x27;s public key is blacklisted and all of the clients are aware of the revocation.<p>Just as a disclaimer, this was rather simplified but I feel like that&#x27;s close enough to get the point across.",1410764204

8317586,comment,8314766,8317289,7,0,sebcrozet,,,"The one application I know for 4D collision detection is 3D continuous collision detection. If two 3D objects are moving, you can parameterize their movement through time to obtain a 4D shape.  If those movements are only translational, and the two shapes are convex and have a support function, then testing for contact is easy (e.g. using GJK). However if those movements contain rotations, the resulting 4D shape will be concave so interference detection may be hard.<p>I do not think anybody actually uses this method though.",1410764147

8317581,comment,8316757,8316757,4,0,Strilanc,,,"Not sure what I think of this. In particular, it seems to be hard-coding effects instead of deriving them from quantum-like rules.<p>This is particularly obvious if you watch the tutorial video for &quot;quantum teleportation&quot; [2]. Although there is a layout to building the teleporter, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to how actual quantum teleportation is implemented. And the final effect is just a location changer, as opposed to the dual of superdense coding that can be used for fun things like &quot;storing&quot; quantum bandwidth [3].<p>To be fair, the video and the site[1] both mention this fact:<p>> qCraft is not a simulation of quantum physics, but it does provide ‘analogies’ that attempt to show how quantum behaviors are different from everyday experience.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just not sure what the goal is. It&#x27;s a cool mod, but I feel like it will just contribute to the general confusion over what quantum mechanics is. People who use it will learn the names of some quantum things, but have only a vague or even misleading idea of what those things really are unless they go looking elsewhere.<p>1: <a href=""http://qcraft.org/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qcraft.org/about/</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebxtWnKx5k&index=4&list=PLU7oY59WpYh7YgIipHx3KHVe8Wl_G99qp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebxtWnKx5k&index=4&list=PLU...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://strilanc.com/quantum/2014/05/11/Storing-Bandwidth-with-Quantum-Teleportation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strilanc.com/quantum/2014/05/11/Storing-Bandwidth-wit...</a>",1410763986

The process of travelling to report an infection and calling for a specialist unit itself carries the risk of the traveller spreading the disease let alone the person with the symptoms.<p>The only way to contain Ebola is to give the families or communities of infected people the knowledge, the drugs, the equipment and the protective clothing to they need to treat themselves and the economic support they will need when they are isolated, which needs to be done at a local level.

Without sending the whole file to the third party, the file reputation service isn&#x27;t &#x27;outsourced&#x27; as you suggest. Sending the MD5 will not do any good if the program makes non-deterministic modifications to its binary.",1410760864

It&#x27;s parity on the CPU - both used a popular ISA CPU (MIPS and PowerPC) with custom additional PUs (VUs and SPEs).<p>As for the same hardware in Xbox1 and PS4... it depends on what degree you make the distinction. Both have AMD&#x27;s SoC however other than the ISA they are very different from programmer&#x27;s PoV: one is a NUMA (DDR3 + ESRAM) another is UMA (GDDR5), which is quite a difference even to a layperson when multi-platform titles compared.<p>My point is that while it makes a good soundbite in journalism, the availability of libraries is pretty irrelevant for a console&#x27;s success.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX_%27Reality_Synthesizer%27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX_%27Reality_Synthesizer%27</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_million-selling_game_consoles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_million-selling_game_co...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_hardware#Graphics_processing_unit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_hardware#Graphics...</a>",1410760803

Even if this fails somehere along the way, it sure will be a success for the &quot;inventor&quot; .. and thus be a success-story for other hopeful wannabes.",1410760800

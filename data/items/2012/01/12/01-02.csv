3454726,comment,3452408,3453512,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"There is a straightforward way to extend bit interleaving to bit strings of arbitrary size using bit-twiddling. The output of the magic constants just have to be shifted in a regular pattern (which varies as a function of dimensionality) so that each word in the array has its bits correctly ordered.<p>The magic constants used in the bit-twiddling example also have a very regular derivation. Designing an algorithm that computes the correct constants for Morton Numbers of arbitrary dimensionality is pretty simple.<p>There is a neat generalization of this algorithm that extends it to irregular bit interleaving patterns at the cost of requiring a few more magic constants (also derivable). I once wrote a compact engine that used algorithmically generated transform constants to produce arbitrary bit interleaving patterns in an arbitrary number of dimensions via these bit-twiddling algorithms.",1326333410

Personally, I thought the hacker dojo should have been called ""The Mountain View Computer Club""  -  it's got a nice retro feel.   I mean, I'm a member, and I like the place, the people, and the organisation, but the name is unfortunate.<p>I think this is a separate discussion from reclaiming ""hacker"" to mean ""technologist""  - Hacker news is about semi-technical entrepreneurs, and we are rather different from people of similar technical skill levels that are not entrepreneurial.  That's an important distinction.   I mean, I introduce myself as ""the tall guy""  as a reference to ""Every technical business has a tall dumb guy and a short smart guy.""   - It would be useful, I think, to have a word for 'semi-technical business guy""  because while my compatriots could also call themselves hackers, I usually act in the semi-technical business guy role.  (I mean, outside of my peer group, I'm a semi-business technical guy of unremarkable height-  obviously, this is a continuum.)",1326333258

3454681,comment,3453141,3454397,3,0,lmkg,,,"Dynamically bound values can be thought of as invisible arguments, that are passed through every function up the call stack. A referentially-transparent function <i>only</i> depends on its explicit arguments, and will always return the same value when passed the same arguments. A function that depends on a dynamically-bound variable may return different values when called with the same arguments.<p>Example (Common Lisp syntax, not actually tested):<p><pre><code>  (defvar z 0)\n   \n  (defun example (x y)\n    (declare (special z))\n    (+ x y z))\n  \n  (example 1 2)\n  \n  ==> 3\n  \n  (let ((z 10))\n    (example 1 2))\n  \n  => 13\n</code></pre>\nIn this sample, the function <i>example</i> is not referentially transparent, because it yields different results when passed the same argument. Note that this happens without using closures or mutation. <i>example</i> does not close over the value of <i>z</i> in any way because it is dynamically scoped[1]. There is no mutation because <i>z</i> is re-bound, which is conceptually different from mutation. It's effectively creating a new binding with the same name and different scope; a function called within that scope will look for the value by name, and find the new binding. The original binding is untouched outside of this new scope.<p>[1] This is tautological; The term ""closure"" is defined to refer to lexical scoping, and was invented to describe it[2].<p>[2] Actually, now that I'm writing this, it occurred to me that your confusion entirely stems from subtleties in the definitions of lexical closure and bindings. A closure is not any function that refers to symbols outside its body. The term only refers to functions that use lexical scoping to do so, and therefore need to ""close over"" their surrounding data and carry it around with them. Functions referencing dynamically scoped variables do not need to carry their data around, because they look up the call stack every time.<p>To your point, it is ""referring to symbols outside the function"" that breaks referential transparency, but dynamic bindings do so in an orthogonal fashion from closures, and unlike closures do not require mutation to do so.",1326332375

""wouldn't it be neat if ..."", I asked a few more friends and we all tried to find something that did what I was asking for but could not. I am a trained therapist and entrepreneur with a small private practice, not a programmer. I have two much younger brothers who are PhD students at major universities so my first call was to them ... ""Do you know any starving brilliant hackers?"" (Starving because I didn't have much money). Long story short - One of them had a best friend who loves writing code ... wanted a new project ... and I am awesome at selling my ideas! We brought on one other partner to manage business development/finances and began! That was 10 months ago. Miraculously, we have had a fabulous working arrangement. We divided the work - so much of the front end work was on the coding side but I have spent 40+ hours a week reading and learning as if I was in grad school again. Now - I handle marketing, PR, and manage tasks/organization of ideas every minute I am not working as a therapist! I still have not officially met my technical partner but we talk for several hours per week and burn the keyboard with emails. My most personal hardship was not having any knowledge about the technical side and being impatient while it was built but our communication started out good and has gotten better along the way. My ambition and drive are sometimes too highly energized for the other two partners but that is good as we seem to balance one another nicely. We have spent less than $4,000 at this point and have a fully functional product with several hundred users (and growing) two months post launch.

In hindsight, the PowerPC first started showing signs of real trouble when Apple had to de-rate the entire Power Mac G4 line by 50MHz between the initial announcement and the first ship, but it still did fairly well for quite a while. It wasn't until close to the switch when the promised 3.0GHz G5 failed to materialize that the differences really got big. The Intel switch wasn't announced until 2005 and didn't happen until 2006.<p>I don't have hard data, but as far as I know, once Macs went Intel, they all got significantly faster <i>and</i> cooler.<p>This was most visible at the top of the line. The last Power Mac G5 had the liquid cooling system and the top end ran four cores at 2.5GHz. I don't know about the liquid cooled model in particular, but the G5s in general were notorious for being noisy due to fans.<p>The first Mac Pro which replaced it ran 8 cores at 3.0GHz and was known to be astonishingly silent. I personally used one as my main work computer for years and it was impossible to get the fans to run fast enough to be audible unless you disabled the smart controls by e.g. leaving a kernel panic on the screen for a while. Obviously, this could be due to more advanced thermal design as well, but even allowing for that, you have twice as many cores, running at a higher clock rate, <i>vastly</i> faster in most real-world use, and with a much simpler cooling system.<p>The laptops had a similar story.

In short, the popular concept of a ""hacker"" is usually considered a cracker around hacker news and similar sites, while the term hacker refers to someone interested in computers or programming.<p>Hacking, as referring to programming, can be both a career or a hobby. ""Software Engineer"" would be a common job title, but many people from different industries enjoy programming on their own time (sometimes in addition to a programming job). Hacking as a hobby is a way to create things in the 21st century, where a digital creation such as a website can be just as real as a physical creation such as a car.<p>In regards to SOPA, there is plenty of reading material on hacker news:\n<a href=""http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=SOPA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=SOPA</a>\n(and one of the earliest links there: <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2011/11/11/stop-sopa-save-the-internet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2011/11/11/stop-sopa-save-the-internet...</a>)\nSome of the articles and comments on those threads will probably be much more useful for your story than comments on this specific thread will be.<p>A little preface to the comments around here: what most people here tend to agree is that SOPA's free speech ramifications are much larger than its ability to stop piracy, regardless of whether they feel piracy is morally wrong or not. SOPA would fundamentally transform the internet in a way that user-created content sites that have taken off over the last decade (Wikipedia, Youtube, Facebook, Reddit, etc.) would become legally infeasible to operate. It also has several constitutionality issues, primarily around free speech and due process of law, both of which would be subverted by SOPA's provisions. But others have already said everything I could more elegantly in the above links.",1326330356

They are extremely effective\n3. DO some hand stretch exercises (yoga helps here). A basic exercise is twining your forearms around each other and stretching them gently.\n4.

Many of these cities have been sold but no one lives there because if the house has been lived in the value will drop. Some houses being flipped now as new are actually 10 years old but no one ever moved in.<p>I wouldn't be too quick to call a crash. Large cities become self-sustaining after a point. Except for Detroit (where the 'city' was mostly divested of wealth in favour of surrounding suburbs), there are few examples of modern cities failing without something catastrophic causing it.<p>Ignoring scam developments, because they happen everywhere, there isn't much chance of a crash unless everyone rich leaves China. Look at places of very significant development, like Chongqing, has a population of 20 million and housing for about 30 million <i>at the moment</i>. It's marked as one of the four 'direct-controlled municipalities' and it's likely to grow further because there are few other places for young educated people to move to out of the rural areas of Southern and Central China.<p>This isn't a defence of China, I'm no fan, but there are realities that must be considered. Urbanization is a real process, people will move from the country to the city seeking wealth.

""Unlimited"" doesn't have a price tag because there's no way of knowing exactly when they'll cut you off, and they most assuredly will, but if they charge by the gigabyte then they don't have any grounds on which to terminate a contract when the customer is already obligated to pay for what they use.

It will show a warning dialog but you can just dismiss that and download anyway.<p>This age limit only matters if parental controls are enabled. You can then pick which apps can be used, based on their age limit (all of them, only 17+, …). Some OS apps like Safari get extra switches – you can explicitly decide whether Safari and a few other things can be used or not.<p>Age limits are not always the best solution, though (what some parents deem appropriate, others do not). That’s why I think the parental controls are badly designed. Ideally you would get a switch for every app, so that you can override the age based defaults. Such a list would still be pretty horrible from a UI point of view – all your apps replicated in one unstructured list – that’s probably why Apple doesn’t do it. Or maybe they just had no time to implement that feature, yet. Either way, it’s no big deal.<p>How would you rate a browser, know that you know how the iPhone’s parental controls work? You can access content with it that a vast majority of parents would consider 17+.<p>(By the way, how do parental controls work on Android? I’m really curious!)",1275785901

1407765,comment,1407576,1407633,0,0,jmatt,,,"I worked on a project where this was the aim last summer. The other founder left to return to med school. He was previously a burned out game programmer and gamer. It ends up med school is lower stress and easier than founding a startup or being a game programmer...<p>There are a few really interesting things that came out of the project. First off, getting people to participate is hard. Without friends or others publicly participating it is less fun and becomes a list of achievements / resume / bragsheet / etc. No one wants to have the fewest achievements. Verifying or other similar proof is difficult. There are plenty of technical solutions but balancing them is key. I ran through a lot of combination and there is a fine line between the verifying processing being clumsy/difficult and being trivially hackable. There have been a lot of unsuccessful attempts in this seemingly obvious space[1,2].<p>I have continued thinking about this and would love to be involved in creating such an application. Currently I'm bootstrapping which doesn't match up well with this sort of project so it was shelved.<p>I think a successful real life achievement app is likely to start out with a small team including design and marketing. So it's unlikely to be bootstrapped, at least by me. But, never say never. Something simple may very well be better than the bloat that is out there. Anything that relies on facebook or iphone won't be the overall winner. It needs to be broader than that. There just aren't enough people comfortable with facebook or using their iphone. Since a successful implementation of the idea involves the network effect the winner will need to be ubiquitous. I guess that is just another way of saying it'll likely be a webapp first then a mobile app and facebook app second.<p>Some interesting related attempts:<p>[1] Life Points

1407764,comment,1406902,1407413,0,0,sjs,,,"That's a common line from the telcos but in reality very little of Canada is actually populated and a huge percentage of our people live within 100-200k of the US border. The most difficult area to cover is BC because of all the trees & mountains. If you look at coverage maps they seem to have little trouble covering even the most rural parts of Alberta. Say Rogers has 1,000,000 3G customers (very modest). How many years does it take to pay off the cost of building the network? 2? 5? 10? At $50-80/month per customer they pull in at least $600,000,000/year. I don't care what their operational costs are they can cover it. That's assuming they have only 1,000,00 customers paying $50/month, while in reality they probably have closer to 5 or 10 million customers paying them upwards of $80/month.<p>I just agreed to pay Rogers $30 for 10MB of roaming data in the US while I'm at WWDC. I'm obviously going to go over that and will be charged $3/MB all the way up beyond the 10MB.<p>That is just greed. They take advantage of people who either have the company paying the bills or don't really know how much data they'll use. There's no way I'll use my phone normally while I'm away, but I should be able to. This has nothing to do with Canadian infrastructure and everything to do with being taken advantage of because we are locked into contracts, and even if we weren't Canadian telcos do not compete with each other. They all have outrageous pricing last I checked. Maybe things have changed with providers besides Rogers during the last couple years but I doubt it. They have no reason to compete with each other if they can fix prices and all make a killing. Prices are too similar across the board for me to think otherwise.",1275785386

It's not clear to me that the virus would just die out. I'll probably end up talking out of my hat but with graph of all the connections (sexual encounters). Would it not be possible to show that you'd need a very connected graph where most people have a small number of encounters and that almost everyone sticks to a low number. One hyper connected infected person (or multitple), could end up infecting a large part of the graph. I would assume that if he affects a large enough number of people, they (before discovering their infection) could infect their connection and ... snowball. In their model, they seem to say that even if their are very promiscuous people, getting non promiscuous people to get more connected would improve the odds. I don't see how that would reduce the number of infected people and kill the virus.<p>Like I said, I have no clue if this is correct or complete crap, never done anything related to disease and how they spread.",1275783055

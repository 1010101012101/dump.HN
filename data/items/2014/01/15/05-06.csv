At 1080p I find FLV streaming services with encryption tend to fall over unless your Internet connection is silly fast, including latency. Any delay, due to poor protocols or poor playback software, will cause the video to stop and rebuffer. Then again, perhaps the video is coming from sufficiently far away that in a live stream, I&#x27;d be right on the borderline of watchable if my ping on the wider internet spikes too much. Eh, what can I say. Every time I can boost the speed tier on my cable line, it seems to slightly improve ping and dramatically improve the reliability of my connection.

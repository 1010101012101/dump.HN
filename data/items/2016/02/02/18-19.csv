I prefer Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s rendition of the former and the translation of the latter by Burton Watson. there are passages in these beautiful works that can pull me right out of a depressive episode, or at least comfort me intellectually while i weather it. there&#x27;s something deeply and mysteriously comforting in their lines. these books have a way of putting thoughts in my head that push out the invasive, repetitive, agitating, stressful thoughts and let me breathe.<p>i&#x27;m not depressed right now, but maybe tonight, or tomorrow. i don&#x27;t mind. i like myself, even my depressed self who hates themself. they know they like themself; they used to feel guilty about hating themself and guilty about being depressed, but they don&#x27;t feel guilty anymore. it makes it easier to cope. they and i know how to keep ourself healthy better than we did before. it&#x27;s a lifetime endeavor, learning your own nature, loving your own nature, letting yourself be the way you are. i feel like this post is very disorganized, scatterbrained, incoherent. i cannot begin to touch upon all of my experiences that have improved me. even if i could, what good is it if i can&#x27;t transfer that deeply personal wisdom to others? the words don&#x27;t carry any of the power of the signified.<p>&#x27;mental hygiene&#x27;. i think this is the key concept to understand. it&#x27;s different for everyone. keeping physically clean keeps away physical disease. keeping mentally clean keeps away mental disease. you can still get sick, but you&#x27;ll get sick less, and you&#x27;ll get better faster. you may even get better for the first time in your life.<p>P.S. i also did a lot of acid but that&#x27;s reckless. it&#x27;s a good way to scar yourself. it&#x27;s also a good way to shove your brain outside of its normal operational range. both have happened to me. i believe that one day there will be a drug gentler than lsd or psilocybin that will be used in controlled therapeutic settings. if you need to escape the inescapable, these drugs will do it.",1454438884

The contents of the loans were not lied about, whether or not they were AAA was not lied about, whether or not they <i>should&#x27;ve</i> been AAA is up for contention.<p>I don&#x27;t see your point with b) at all.<p>If you&#x27;re a bank it&#x27;s not like there are a ton of avenues for you to invest your money, and outside of mortgages there aren&#x27;t a lot of ways to pass the money onto consumers.  So if what you want is the bank to pass its new found money onto consumers that&#x27;s the avenue you want.  Unfortunately the last time we did that a lot of unqualified people got loans.  So my point is it&#x27;s tricky.",1454437741

Colleges thought that they could raise rates now, and expect the economy to catch up with higher salaries later. That didn&#x27;t happen. In fact the opposite happened: the economy tanked, and a bunch of people were left with lots of debt and jobs that can&#x27;t support it.

Consider:<p>* Because we tax income, a person with $1 billion in assets who makes $100,000 pays less tax than a person with $0 assets and makes $150,000.<p>* Because we tax income, a person who loses all their assets in the housing collapse but earns $100,000 pays more tax than the person whose assets appreciate $1 million but earns only $50,000 in income.<p>* If we tax wealth, future taxes are much more predictable, enabling more efficient long-term investment and planning. I could make a pretty good guess about what my tax bill will be next year, 5 years from now, etc. The billionaire can make much longer-term projections.<p>As a rough estimate of the wealth tax rate: One estimate of total wealth in the US is $80 trillion and the federal government takes in ~$3 trillion in revenue. By those numbers, the wealth tax rate would be 3.75% for the average American, if all that revenue were replaced by a wealth tax.",1454436879

Three additional patients dropped out prematurely. The intervention is a broad-based nutritional supplement of dietary nutrients, primarily chelated trace minerals and vitamins, administered in high doses. At study entry and periodically thereafter, patients were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).<p>RESULTS:\nFor those who completed the minimum 6-month open trial, symptom reduction ranged from 55% to 66% on the outcome measures; need for psychotropic medications decreased by more than 50%. Paired t tests revealed treatment benefit on all measures for patients completing the trial: HAM-D mean score at entry = 19.0, mean score at last visit = 5.4, t = 5.59, df = 9, p < 01; BPRS mean score at entry = 35.3, mean score at last visit = 7.4, t = 2.57, df = 9, p <.05; YMRS mean score at entry = 15.1, mean score at last visit = 6.0, t = 4.11, df = 9, p < .01. The effect size for the intervention was large (> .80) for each measure. The number of psychotropic medications decreased significantly to a mean +/- SD of 1.0+/-1.1 (t = 3.54, df = 10, p < .01). In some cases, the supplement replaced psychotropic medications and the patients remained well. The only reported side effect (i.e., nausea) was infrequent, minor, and transitory.<p>CONCLUSION:\nSome cases of bipolar illness may be ameliorated by nutritional supplementation. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with bipolar I disorder is currently underway, as well as open trials in children.",1454436755

Maximal speed, fixed memory size.<p>2. Memory growth. As the article mentions, asm.js no longer supports this, but Emscripten does. It just removes the &#x27;use asm&#x27;.<p>3. Split memory. As the article mentions, this is non-asm.js. This supports not just growing and shrinking memory, but allocating each chunk of memory separately, leading to flexibility similar to that of Cheerp.<p>The article compares 1 and 3, but not 2. In practice, almost all Emscripten users use 1, a small amount use 2, and as far as I know almost no one uses 3. Also, 2 would start up much faster than 1, and run much faster than 3, so it would be an interesting comparison to Cheerp.<p>Regarding startup time, there are two things that I think should have been measured:<p>1. Large programs. The largest they test is the Bullet physics library, which is still quite small.<p>2. Execution of the first few frames. Non-asm.js code, like Cheerp output, is compiled dynamically. This generally means that startup is fast, then the first few frames are very slow, then it eventually gets smooth. The measurements in the blogpost appear to ignore that.<p>Both of those things - larger programs, and more sophisticated measurements of startup speed - are present in the open source Massive benchmark [1].

Instead of going on some punitive goose chase of enforcing an unrealistic speed limit, we (members of a neighborhood association) approached it as what it was -- a traffic engineering problem.<p>In our case, traffic light timings weren&#x27;t adjusted appropriately, so drivers felt compelled to &quot;race&quot; in order to catch a light. Lane markings were unclear, so it wasn&#x27;t obvious where drivers should be if they were turning. Crosswalks tape was pulled up, and it wasn&#x27;t obvious to a driver turning where the pedestrians crossed. Also, the pedestrian signal buttons were broken.<p>We lobbied the city council people and mayor pretty heavily, and they made a few modest investments in signals, signage, paint and a traffic study. 5 years later, accidents dropped by 40% in that corridor.",1454436380

11021139,comment,11018111,11018724,0,0,toast0,,,"> The argument about RST spoofing seems somewhat contrived - if you have the means to inject arbitrary packets, chances are you also have the means to read them, so what sequence numbers are being used is known.<p>hwh addressed this, but to add more context, there are many places where you can inject spoofed packets with absolutely no visibility into the real data flow. If you&#x27;re connected to an ISP that doesn&#x27;t do BCP 38 filtering (for whatever reason), you can send packets to any destination from any source, but can only see packets destined for you (and possibly other people in your/nearby subnets). Even if you are subject to BCP 38 filtering, that may be at the network edge, so you can likely spoof packets from any source to a destination within your network.<p>So, if you have the capability to send a spoofed RST packet and any RST works, you just need to know the connection 4-tuple {Peer1IP, Peer2IP, Peer1Port, Peer2Port} in many common protocols, one of the peer&#x27;s ip and port is well known, and you may be able to easily determine the other peer&#x27;s IP and guess the port; 64k packets sent to disrupt someone&#x27;s IRC connection isn&#x27;t a lot.  If you also have to guess the sequence number, it&#x27;s a lot harder.<p>>> What would really suck is if an operating system were to totally ignore the rule to reply with an RST when receiving a packet on a closed socket.<p>> Isn&#x27;t this behaviour explicitly encouraged to prevent port scanning and related attacks?<p>There&#x27;s a difference between sending a response to a SYN packet, and sending a response to a packet that was sent on a previously established socket. The packet trace shown is really pathological -- because the client is only willing to send one RST, the server is likely to do a lot of retransmits and only figure out the connection is closed when retransmit timers expire; this is wasted effort and resources on the server side, but also for the client&#x27;s network. At least the client should keep the socket in a FIN_WAIT state for some period of time to send RSTs, but it should also send RSTs when an otherwise unexpected packet comes in that appears to be from an established connection, that way it will stop getting data it can&#x27;t process. It&#x27;s reasonable to rate limit sending of RSTs, if you&#x27;re concerned about DDoS via reflection, or other resource usage issues.",1454436351

We started on EC2, two instances over a load balancer. We had to go for 2 medium instances as smalls couldn&#x27;t scale fast enough when the traffic spiked.<p>We had to create the logic to deploy the application simultaneously to all running instances and writing monitoring code to ensure everything was scaling properly (the load balancer triggers just weren&#x27;t up to it). Daily traffic 2k users, cost 200USD a month. About 4 non-trivial outages in the 5 months we were on AWS.<p>With GAE we push to git, deploy done. No setting up deployment, no complex monitoring for scaling. Daily traffic 15k users, costs 30USD a month. 1 non-trivial outage in around 20 months now, with 100% uptime during 2013.<p>We have run a reasonable scale, reasonable traffic production grade application for at least 5 months on both, long enough to make an extensive comparison for our application.

I was going to move them to Lubuntu; however, the USB WiFi dongle they are using refused to cooperate -- or rather, the Lubuntu live disk I was testing refused to cooperate with it.<p>The dongle&#x27;s chipset was Linux friendly and had apparently worked without major problems up to about Ubuntu 10.10 or so.  Google revealed the eruption of numerous reports of problems at that time.<p>Problems that apparently persisted through several releases, for a good couple of years.<p>The solution that people found worked was to download driver source code from the chipset manufacturer (RA) and build it, with custom settings, on one&#x27;s own machine.  Some also found success with banning one or more apparently concurrently competing drivers from being loaded on their system.  Per some descriptions, multiple compatible drivers would wrestle for control of the device, evincing symptoms matching what I&#x27;d experienced.<p>I was getting ready start a custom build and/or perhaps whacking driver loads -- after installing Lubuntu to get past the fixed Live CD configuration, when I thought to try the plain Ubuntu live disk as opposed to Lubuntu.  Problem gone.<p>Working stuff breaks.  Breaks persist for months if not years.  Ostensibly compatible/comparable systems aren&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not going to complain; it is what we make of it.

It&#x27;s enough to be a good starting point for entirely-FOSS implementations like PureDarwin.<p>Basically, from the open-source components alone, you have a kernel (XNU), userland (based on FreeBSD), init system (launchd), print server (CUPS), and X11 support, among various other things.<p>One of the key missing pieces is Cocoa, along with the other miscellaneous pieces accompanying it in the transition from NeXTSTEP/OpenStep to OS X.  However, much of it is implemented already by GNUStep, and while GNUStep isn&#x27;t advertised as being binary-compatible with Cocoa, it <i>is</i> advertised as being <i>source</i>-compatible, and therefore still useful (with XNU and the BSD-based userland, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if binary-compatibility could be achieved, but I don&#x27;t think the GNU devs are prioritizing that right now).<p>The other significant missing piece is Aqua/Quartz.  Quartz is replaceable with X11 or Wayland, and Aqua can likely be replaced by X11 WMs / Wayland compositors with good theme support.  Given the sheer number of Aqua lookalike themes floating around for the major DEs/WMs, that&#x27;s probably not a big problem (not to mention DEs like Étoilé that are designed specifically to mimic OS X; Étoilé in particular is designed to integrate well with GNUStep).",1406141316

I did try, with == and !=, and that attempt bounced because of adoption-in-full (taking in versioning and backward compatibility).<p>Number-locked versioning and related protocols such as content-negotiation via the Accept: header have failed hard on the Web, over and over.<p>Sure, lots could have been better, but the time to get it right was 1995 May, not during standardization in late 1996 or 1997. At that point, &quot;don&#x27;t break the Web&quot; prevailed, as it does still, among competing browser vendors.<p>/be",1406140326

8076052,comment,8074288,8075201,1,0,contingencies,,,"This is true. The difference, however, is that software development is often considered to be largely an art centered around managing complexity.<p>While we&#x27;re generally OK at doing this in the scope of one piece of software, we suck at doing it in workflow terms, particularly where other humans, inter-organizational dependencies, money and existing systems are involved. What this article is really talking about is shifting the complexity of the varying development and deployment toolchains and processes adopted by each different project and organization away from the developer.<p>The author cites a fairly simple example from the commercial programming world. The complexities he refers to are version control systems, editors/IDEs, build tools, language selection, database/persistence layer selection, test deployment, bug tracking, release processes.<p>Let&#x27;s assume learning basic <i>git</i>, how to use web-based issue trackers and a text editor are reasonably considered non-negotiable, per-programmer overhead. The author still has a fair point that IDEs can be a plague in some sectors (mobile and Java in particular).<p>He is also correct that build tools are numerous, but what makes them so painful? Doug McIlroy famously stated <i>Keep it simple, make it general, and make it intelligible.</i> Is part of the pain that many of them are language-specific, with zero or poor integration with external (eg. system-wide) software package databases / dependency trees? It seems that, today, every operating system distribution and every programming language running upon them generally has (at least) one half-baked, error-prone, cross-platform package management solution with its own versioning scheme, configuration overhead, network assumptions, poorly implemented caching system and probably a broken use of cryptographic primitives. They&#x27;re not <i>general</i>.<p>Database/persistence layer selection is an architectural question that is easy to either delay or perhaps - if extensive performance tuning is certainly expected, or deployment environments will certainly be heterogeneous in their persistence layers - sidestep through a layer of abstraction (CRUD) to facilitate provider abstraction. These paths are considered good practice - Ken Thompson teaches us to <i>Spell creat with an &#x27;e&#x27;</i> (ie. premature optimization is a fallacy), Eric S. Raymond restates <i>Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.</i> and RFC3439 summarizes most eloquently <i>Optimization considered harmful: In particular, optimization introduces complexity, and as well as introducing tighter coupling between components and layers.</i><p>The final points of pain (test deployment, release processes) are essentially process design and infrastructure interaction and management issues. While the author mentions the <i>additional complexity of the cloud</i>, in truth this area has become a point of pain so intense that many projects now write their code and internal test/release processes specifically targeting one infrastructure provider (EC2, docker, etc.). That&#x27;s not very <i>general</i> either, now is it?<p>So where is there clear room for improvement? The build tool issues are mostly a convention versus configuration question, which is philosophical and not going away. The process/infrastructure issues do seem to be the main candidates for change, and this does appear to be the focus of the author&#x27;s call for approaches.<p><i>Tesler&#x27;s Law of Conservation of Complexity: Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal with it - the user, the application developer, or the platform developer?</i> - Larry Tesler (ca. 1984)<p>One could take the same view of the development process itself. Well, then... who are we pushing the complexity to? Is it...<p>(1) a single cloud provider of choice (EC2)?<p>(2) a platform-specific virtualization wrapper of choice (docker)?<p>(3) a person or team within the organization who just delegates truth from above (BOFH-style)?<p>(4) Some lightweight, open source workflow solution that enables us to step beyond the provider/technology lock-in of (1) or (2) and remains painless and configurable enough for mass adoption?<p>I believe that (1) and (2) do not meet the complexity requirements of larger scale users, and that (3) is not scalable or efficient. I think (3) will exist, but focus more on policy, whereas (4) style solutions will appear in the same vein as the literate, simplistically ops-oriented command line interfaces championed most recently by <i>heroku</i>, <i>vagrant</i> and <i>docker</i>.  Regarding (4), if we get it right, we don&#x27;t even need to notice the implementation. As Minsky said: <i>We&#x27;re more aware of simple processes that don&#x27;t work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly.</i>.",1406140112

It only mitigates the issue. They double the size of the stack (by default) when they hit the current stack limit. When the GC happens they take the still unused portion of the stack memory and turn it back over to the OS by freeing it. If the recursion is still too large for the overall system memory it&#x27;ll still hit a limit (system memory), they&#x27;ve just succeeded in delaying it for non-tail recursive functions.<p>That said, it is a nice way to reduce the chance or delay the occurrence of hitting the stack limit (whether it&#x27;s on the heap or an explicit stack that&#x27;s still what&#x27;s happening).",1406139946

Or, more accurately—considering the trivial query and small payload—the overhead of the database driver and the wire protocol are significant factors.  That said, there remains a fairly broad distribution over the Single-query test and Fortunes tests.  For the low and medium-performance frameworks, the overhead of their ORM and other factors are more significant than the database.  I find it can be illuminating that in many cases, the ORM code necessary to marshal result-sets into usable objects is more costly than the underlying queries.<p>Meanwhile, the 20-query test is a bit pathological as it runs into a brick wall with the database wire protocol and efficiency of the database driver.  Many otherwise high-performance frameworks and platforms become bottle-necked waiting on those 20 queries per request.  But you and I agree, a 20-query-per-request scenario should be the exception and not the rule.  When developing a smooth-running web-application, it&#x27;s common to aim for zero queries per page load.  (For those who find this to be crazy talk, note that I&#x27;m saying we aim for that ideal, and may not necessarily achieve it.)<p>I too particularly enjoy knowing the high-water mark set by the JSON and Plaintext tests.

How do you do this?</i><p>In principle, you have that problem with almost any language that uses the system stack to pass arguments when it makes a function call. It just happens to be easier to trigger it if you use a recursive algorithm, because it’s unlikely that you would write a program with 200,000 distinct functions each of which just called the next in a chain until something fell over.<p>In practice, recursive algorithms are often used to walk recursive data structures and often have logarithmic complexity in the size of the data structure. Even structures that fill the memory of a supercomputer probably aren’t going to need more than a few hundred levels of recursion in that scenario, while the available stack space is probably several orders of magnitude larger. So to be blunt, unless you really are talking about something where failure really isn’t an option (safety critical systems and the like), you probably just treat this as the same kind of catastrophic failure that running out of system memory would be, and use some OS-level support to abort as gracefully as you can if the sky falls.<p>If you really are working in a more constrained environment — safety-critical code, say, or perhaps an embedded system with relatively little memory  — then it might be the case that you simply avoid the recursion altogether unless you’re using a language that guarantees tail recursion will be dealt with robustly. Some coding standards forbid the use of dynamically allocated memory for much the same reason, and you just have to use different tools to solve those problems if you’re working with such constraints.",1406139008

I&#x27;m not writing this to attack AppScale, as it&#x27;s providing a valuable service to App Engine users, but I don&#x27;t want anyone to be harmed by the decision to build on App Engine.<p>Think carefully before you build new projects on App Engine APIs. The idea that you will get more affordable scaling than other services without system administration is a complete fantasy. By the time you&#x27;re deploying AppScale the fantasy is obvious because you are now doing all the normal work of scaling and normal system administration, and also the work of dealing with App Engine&#x27;s flaws. But if you are green enough to get taken in by the fantasy once, then it probably won&#x27;t be dispelled until after you&#x27;ve already lost months to years wishing you had chosen something else.<p>First you pay a heavy cost in extra development time to work around App Engine&#x27;s idiosyncratic APIs, bizarre restrictions and quotas. Then you pay fees which are exorbitant by comparison with what you will get almost anywhere else. Then you may discover that support for the runtime you are using is lagging in a way that doubles your bills, and will never be fixed (and App Engine will never again have close to the interest and staffing it once had). How does it sound to rewrite in another language? Then you will discover and have to work around frequent service outages using the limited tools provided. All this with Google&#x27;s famed lack of support - unless your spend is extremely high, which means you&#x27;re losing even more money for having chosen App Engine. And let&#x27;s just hope Google doesn&#x27;t double, triple or quadruple monthly bills again.<p>If you run into any of these problems (and you will), you&#x27;re stuck and your only real option is to move platforms, which means most of your code will have to be rewritten. AppScale is a final resort; there is no other option. If that doesn&#x27;t work well for you, notably if the overhead of AppScale itself costs you too much, then you are still going to have to rewrite most of your code. If you don&#x27;t already have a lot of App Engine code you can&#x27;t replace, it isn&#x27;t smart to plan to run a huge AppScale deployment.<p>If you think you will be doing a large deployment then you should look at technologies which were developed in the open from the beginning and which still have a lot of active momentum. Or just use normal Linux boxes and worry about scaling issues as you need to, like everyone else. Just don&#x27;t get locked into weird vendor-specific APIs like App Engine.",1406138476

We know quite a bit about humans, the psychology they approach an interface with, their physical abilities to use an interface. With this information and a target experience you want to design for, the design choices follow.<p>We can objectively measure things like whether a user approaching an interface can easily understand what options are available to them, whether the user can intuitively tell what actions to take to activate those options, whether at every point the user can tell what state the system is in through its interface.<p>It is absolutely true that if you are developing for, say, ascii-loving adult S.U.D. gamers your design requirements will be different than if you are developing for casual gaming tweens. But we can still say that the DF interface is pretty bad for the vast majority of users who want to play the game.",1372852717

It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that the NSA can be tapping fibers, running its own fibers back to Utah, storing the data in a massive storage network, running millions of CPUs to decrypt it all, reverse-engineering the ever-changing application protocols, running very deep analysis against the results, and then coming up with the targets&#x27; communications patterns.

Therefore you&#x27;re going to get some false positives (thinking your phone is vibrating when it isn&#x27;t) and/or some false negatives (not noticing when your phone really is vibrating).<p>It&#x27;s possible to trade off between these by adjusting the threshold for detection. There&#x27;s no reason why the optimal point (or the approximation to optimality that your brain actually chooses) should give no false positives; more likely it will give some false positives and some false negatives.<p>The end.<p>(This tradeoff occurs all over the place. One interesting example, due to Justin Barrett, is the suggestion that (1) one thing our brains are set up to detect is signs of <i>agency</i> -- something purposeful acting in our vicinity, and (2) it is generally better for us to be too sensitive (thinking there is a tiger hiding in the trees when there isn&#x27;t really) than not sensitive enough (not noticing the tiger, and getting eaten). And that this is the mechanism underlying a lot of belief in the supernatural: we see something, have the feeling that someone or something must have made it that way on purpose, and on looking closer fail to find any good candidates ... and are then liable to conclude that <i>something we can&#x27;t directly detect</i> made it so.)",1372851790

Many things whose possibility is now obvious were not obvious at the time; many things that are now being tried will fail.<p>To pick apart your post:<p>* &quot;main area of expertise&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;main source of income&quot;.<p>* RankDex or for that matter HITS, is not the same thing as a search engine that you would actually use in preference to AltaVista; 1998 Google was already better than AV for the things that were in its index.  Baidu didn&#x27;t exist as a company until 2000.<p>* &quot;just a matter of resources and monetizing&quot; is hindsight bias.  Hotmail was so sure Gmail was an April Fool&#x27;s joke that they issued a response press release in which they offered more space than Gmail.  The fact that Gmail was capable of offering two orders of magnitude more machine resources was, in large part, a result of internal infrastructural innovations at Google that weren&#x27;t copied at other companies for many years.  Of course, some people dismissed it as a &quot;PR stunt&quot;.<p>* Where2 had a downloadable C++ desktop maps application and an idea about doing it browser-side when Google bought them.  Gmail and Google Maps popularized AJAX, which had been previously considered impractical, despite our efforts at KnowNow.<p>* By &quot;many parts of the world&quot; do you mean a few apartment blocks in Seoul, Hong Kong, and Tokyo?  I don&#x27;t really think Kansas City is comparable in either density or wealth.<p>* I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s innovative about Android (which, you forgot to mention, started as a separate company, like Where2).  I care that I don&#x27;t have to sign my first-born child away to Apple to program my smartphone.  I&#x27;d care a lot more if Google had actually achieved what they set out to achieve with Android.<p>* If you&#x27;re equating SquirrelFish (pre-Extreme) to the first release of V8, you&#x27;re living in a fantasy world.  There was an order of magnitude difference.  Apple and Mozilla closed the gap substantially in the next few months because (a) V8 showed it was possible; (b) V8 showed <i>how</i> it was possible; and (c) V8 made it necessary.<p>* I meant MapReduce, which is another of those things that&#x27;s obvious in hindsight, but was actually far from obvious, and which underpins nearly every data-heavy startup today.<p>* &quot;Would have put out if&quot; is Monday-morning quarterbacking, just like your hindsight bias on the other items.  And there are plenty of companies with more money than Google that don&#x27;t have robot cars on the road.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens with the robot cars and balloon internet.  I think there&#x27;s a substantial chance they&#x27;ll fall far short of hopes, just like Wave (which I notice you didn&#x27;t mention), but that&#x27;s the way it is when you try things that may not be possible.<p>I&#x27;m not actually all that positive about Google, but I think that if you want to understand them, you need to understand what they value.

If so, Im not really referring to the NSA thing, rather our social economic position in general.<p>As for spying, and what not, no. In many ways we are worse off, with less ability to do much about it. Yes, we in the UK have more CCTV than any other country on the planet. Yes we just &quot;got used to it&quot;, apparently. No, we don&#x27;t have a constitution to protect us, but even then it seems the US gov can still circumvent the constitution as and then it sees fit.<p>If you mean a choice between being in the EU proper and being a 51st state, then I think it ridiculous to even think about being a 51st state. If nothing else, geography and culture. Despite the shared language, we actually have less in common with Americans than the French, but confuse similarity with a shared language. The comment was intended to be flippant. The idea of American courts fills me with dread. I would genuinely, hand on heart, rather kill myself than face the US idea of justice. Which is one of the reasons I oppose our amusing one sided extradition treaty where the US only has to accuse, no evidence required. But if we want an American for trial, we have to provide evidence, and go through much more due process. We signed up in good faith for an equal deal, we ratified it, the US ignored it. Because we Brits are spineless suckups, we keep to our side of the deal, with out any complaint. This is why you might see me say things like our gov will happily betray its own people to the US.<p>Despite our problems, I&#x27;d rather have our problems, and EU problems, than US ones any day of the week. I would never ever want to be American or governed by Americans. Simply, US culture is not something I either understand or identify with once you get below the surface. No problem with America existing as it stands, and if that is how Americans want to be, then I completely support that, in the same was I support people who want to have, say, an Islamic government. Its their right to choose. Also, always remember our histories. We, US, UK, and that hypothetical Islamic country, all have different histories and reasons for being where we are. We are different. Equally valid, but different. And as the French say, vive la diffrence.<p>I really hope that answers your question.

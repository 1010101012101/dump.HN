It&#x27;s a large expensive system of state oppression .. that acts on remarkably few people(+). There is a gulag archipelago, Guantanamo, but it contains only 46 prisoners now. Outside it, hundreds of millions of people live pretty free lives in the western world. So there&#x27;s little public appetite for doing anything about it. If you&#x27;re not reading about it in the news you can ignore it entirely.<p>Perhaps the main output of the surveillance program is the targeting information for drone strikes. This results in thousands dead .. but they are a long way away, in a part of the world that has its own problems with violence.<p>Your actual chances of being victimised by the surveillance state for engaging in nonviolent leftwing politics are very small. But perhaps its worth noting that radical leftwing groups seem more likely to be investigated by law enforcement than radical rightwing groups that advocate all kinds of crazy things, <i>including actual violence against the government</i> (second amendment supporters).<p>(+) (note that I&#x27;m talking about just surveillance here, as distinct from the War on Drugs, the horrifyingly high American prison population, racism in the police, or heavy-handed public order policing)<p>(note 2: I&#x27;m from the UK, which has its own problems with official support for surveillance, occasional brutal policing, and particularly the state&#x27;s role in violence in Northern Ireland has not been properly dealt with nor atoned for).",1382353098

I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding the type of programmers they are. They didn&#x27;t use mmap because they are sloppy everywhere, they used mmap because their critical innovation was not in storage. What they really thought was valuable, what they wanted to work on, was the query language and cluster management tools, so they did the simplest thing for storage and moved on (personally I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t just use BDB, maybe they were afraid of transactions, but I suppose everyone has a little NIH syndrome in their database). Now they&#x27;re a bit locked in to that code, because after bolting on journaling (that architecture is a brilliant but incredibly dirty hack), the code is a mess and I&#x27;m sure nobody wants to touch it. In fact most of the other subsystems have been getting cleaner rewrites, except for the storage layer. I think the only way out is a complete replacement, which is what we did so I feel pretty good about that. So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll convince you, but I&#x27;ve read a lot of their code (especially in the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve been backporting things from 2.4), and that&#x27;s the feeling I get about their history and vision.

They&#x27;re sometimes not the easiest things to navigate and search, but if you sit down with one of the librarians, they really can show you some great tips for finding what you want.<p>Two of the biggest providers that I&#x27;ve used frequently in the past are EBSCO Host and ProQuest. Both have subscriptions to large and sometimes overlapping journals. I found EBSCO Host a little easier to use if I wanted to browse an entire journal over the span of time. ProQuest had more flexible and reliable search results. Both will allow you to find tons of peer reviewed papers.<p>Also, if you want to explore who has cited who, and who wrote which papers, look to ISI Web of Knowledge. It has a cool citations explorer that lets you visualize citations and authors.<p>Finally, contact some experts in your field. If looking at peer-reviewed content, get a hold of a university professor in the field of interest, because they will be able to tell you which journals are A or B journals, and which ones to avoid.

6584616,comment,6582454,6584216,4,0,rmk2,,,"Excellent, alongside the Humanities, then, we can also close down physics, because, clearly, if benefits can&#x27;t be measured, why waste money?<p>Many of the &quot;impact&quot; arguments assume that the only victims will be the humanities, a sacrifice lots of people are very willing to make. (The original article talks, albeit not quite as strongly, of a hemorrhaging that is slowly happening in terms of funding, jobs and perspective.) However, there is some other, less obvious, collateral damage: physics, mathematics (except for applied maths), economics all share similar problems.<p>And here are some choice quotes about the UK&#x27;s REF and its &quot;Impact&quot; pilot study, with &quot;Impact&quot; being an integral part of the future score (20%, which is going to go up to 25% for the next one) that decides about research spending from Research Councils over the next couple years, due in 2014:<p>> &quot;Physicists had some particular concerns about the challenge of assessing impact in the manner foreseen by HEFCE.\n1. The difficulty in attributing UoA-specific ownership of impact that arises from the work of a large collaboration, either experimental (in our case, a ten-institute international collaboration working on experiments at CERN) or theoretical (an eight-institute collaboration using High Performance Computing facilities).<p>2. The blurry distinction between the use of new high performance computers and the stimulation of the development of these machines. At what point does close collaboration with a company such as IBM in the development of teraflop or petaflop computers become impact?<p>4. Commercial confidentiality became an issue. Even in this pilot exercise, and making use of the Confidential tag on the submissions, we still had to remove some of the strongest material concerning cooperation with industrial companies because of confidentiality agreements. In REF itself, this would be a huge problem. It should be noted that this also contributed to the Institute of Physics giving up on a recent exercise to try to quantify the impact of Physics. It is impossible to quantify the impact of public understanding of science initiatives such as TV and radio appearances, popular lectures, books, etc at the scale of individuals or groups. Across the community, such work clearly has an important impact, but this cannot be sensibly quantified.&quot; (p. 29)<p>> &quot;Several respondents noted that research impact was most readily observed and measured where the distance between the two realms, research and impact, was relatively short and the pathways rather direct: for example, applied scientists working in collaboration with a private business seeking expressly to translate the generic insights into commercial advantage.<p>The socio-economic impact of more fundamental research might go unnoticed and unremarked most of the time, reflecting the diffuse, cumulative and rather unpredictable nature of intellectual advances. Indeed, one might imagine that the occasion where a fundamental breakthrough produces a relatively immediate and direct social improvement is rare, even anomalous. In practical terms, this means the impact case studies track back to particular types of people and types of work. It might also mean that some of the most consequential socio-economic contributions will be excluded by virtue of their rather indirect link with cutting-edge research.<p>There was a suggestion that institutions had taken the low hanging fruit, and that in some sense the portfolio of case studies was not a good representation of the breadth of research undertaken. This sentiment appears to be rooted in a general sense that impact is most obvious in some narrow areas, within subjects rather than between them, and largely unknowable, at least in practical terms, in most instances. There were also suggestions made that a proportion of the more significant, evident impacts was linked to people and activities outside the very best academic research, albeit dependent upon that work, and which would be overlooked as a result. There is always going to be an over-reliance on a small number of sub-groups, even individuals, whose research happens to lend itself to non-academic impact. The impact submission is not necessarily representative of the UoA as a whole.&quot; (p. 30)<p>> &quot;The biggest challenge was the need to acquire evidence to reveal the reach and significance of a given impact. There were many practical issues that stood in the way, and the response of the majority, for the pilot exercise at least, was to firstly focus on the more obvious cases and, secondly, to use whatever narratives, references and statistics that came to hand readily.&quot; (p. 31)<p>Source: REF Research Impact Pilot Exercise Lessons-Learned Project Feedback on Pilot Submissions, November 2010 (<a href=""http://www.ref.ac.uk/pubs/refimpactpilotlessons-learnedfeedbackonpilotsubmissions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ref.ac.uk/pubs/refimpactpilotlessons-learnedfeedb...</a>)",1382353008

And programmers use Python when they need to prototype stuff, script things, or write a quick tool where performance doesn&#x27;t matter - and when performance does matter, they either end up calling out to C (which is actually good for that) or they end up rewriting in Java and cursing out that language.",1382352725

The problem is what comes before that. In France, to have an engineering degree (equivalent of a MSc) from a top school, you go through:<p>- High school, where the quality of education and the technical level is <i>very</i> low IMO.<p>- CPGE. This is a French specificity, two years dedicated to preparing competitive exams. Basically, you only study maths and physics in the abstract there. This is the reason why our math level is so high compared to other countries. But the math we study is not the most useful: lots, lots of analysis, a decent amount of algebra, almost no statistics and nothing discovered since the end of the XIXth century (exit Turing, exit Gdel...).<p>- Only after that do you study at a &quot;Grande cole&quot; for three years... But you have to catch up things like project management and so on so <i>real</i> technical education is limited.<p>In the end, we produce generalists that are often good at everything but <i>very good</i> at nothing.

I ended up biting the bullet and explicitly looping over the slice member, but the point of prototyping is being able to think of your code in the terms of your problem domain.",1382349841

Lately I cannot stop thinking about it. I have always been considered a &#x27;smart person&#x27;. I am a self-taught freelance developer now - it used to be my hobby and somehow (mostly because I needed location-independent work quickly) it became my profession. I get by because everybody thinks I am smart but I feel like an impostor because the more I think about myself the more I realize that intelligence is not some general ability to solve problems - it&#x27;s more just a set of very different skills that corelate to much lesser extent than people usually think and you can be really good at something that people use to judge your abilities and at the same time really bad at something else that is actually required to get the job done.<p>I studied sociology and I shortly worked as a data analyst. It seems to me that this kind of work requires... ehm... a different intelligence than programming. You need to be good at connecting the dots, noticing things, seeing patterns. This is my kind of thinking and I have always been good at this - doubting everything, seeing pure assumptions where other people saw &#x27;truths&#x27;, permanently creating hypotheses and alternative theories, trying to spot logical fallacies in prevailing theories... basically trying to spot things.<p>Programing is very different (at least it seems to me - so different tat it&#x27;s even difficult do describe it). I guess it&#x27;s about creating stuff, not just observing stuff. You need to build very complex and abstract mental models, keep them in your head and be able to operate with them - and this is the part of intelligence that I seem to be lacking. It just does not feel natural. I try to solve some problem and I am thinking... if this condition and that condition but at the same time not that condition... and bang!, suddenly I am lost and I don&#x27;t even remember what I am doing. I cannot keep it in my head. I totally get what OP was saying about passing anonymous functions in JavaScript - I had the same experience. The first time I encountered something so simple as JavaScript closures it took me two hours to get it. And the day after that I had to repeat the whole mental process to get there again because I somehow lost it over night. This is simply not how my brain works and I think I am really bad at this. Yet people pay me for this... which is just depressing (and you understand why I write this under throwaway).<p>I remember our &#x27;statistical analysis 101&#x27; professor always telling us &#x27;remember, you are not really testing hypotheses, you are only testing indicators!&#x27; - if HR department picks wrong indicators for the skills that they actually need both company and employee are going to be unhappy - and I think this is very common because our understanding of the indicators for different kinds of &#x27;being smart&#x27; is still poor.",1382349632

9210072,comment,9207245,9209634,0,0,nemothekid,,,"<i>game devs like notch have made a conscious and canny decision to value actually making something over code quality.</i><p>These aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive. When Carmack, Sweeney et al. built Quake/Unreal, they made something that was both fun and had incredible code quality. Derivatives of the Quake & Unreal engines run <i>today</i> and have been for the last 20 years. I&#x27;m doubtful that any code written by Notch for Minecraft will be running anywhere 20 years from now. Likewise, don&#x27;t NASA engineers &quot;actually make something&quot; while adhering to strict code quality? Doesn&#x27;t Google &quot;actually make something&quot; while adhering to strict code quality? The choice between &quot;code quality&quot; and &quot;actually delivering&quot; is a false dichotomy invented by people who needed an excuse.<p>Next, I never implied Notch was a shoddy programmer. Notch is a great programmer by his own merits and I don&#x27;t think anyone can doubt that - however great programmers can produce shitty code. What I was responding to was OPs assertion that 10x programmers exist. Notch produced some pretty great stuff, and iterated <i>quickly</i>, but that speed didn&#x27;t come free and surely theres a lot of technical debt that others now have to deal with.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing. Sometimes its more important that you can ship first, and fix later. Sometimes being first to market is better than being the best. What I want to point out however this is a normal tradeoff and this doesn&#x27;t make Notch a &quot;10x engineer&quot; (when I say 10x here I mean a mythical man who has achieved enlightenment that none of us can achieve even if we worked for 1000 years). He&#x27;s a great developer, but we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that there weren&#x27;t tradeoffs to his approach and that his style is anyway mythical (like a unicorn).",1426485533
9210071,comment,9207245,9209280,0,0,Sir_Substance,,,">What I mean is good programmers will find way to solve something using less code. That is very imporant for understandability, maintenance, and long term support.<p>It&#x27;s not about less code, it&#x27;s about simplicity of code. I have known people who have played code golf with production code, either out of bordom or a desire to generate job security. That&#x27;s not actually solving the core problem of making it easier for someone to port to a new version of an OS in 5 years time, it only looks that way if you aren&#x27;t paying attention. Short code can be just as confusing as long code.<p>Your code should, in all places where it is not necessary to do crazy speed optimisations, be understandable by the average intern. Yes, that means comments, and yes, sometimes it means doing something in one line that is more commonly done in 20 lines and yes, sometimes it means taking 20 lines to do something you could do in one line.",1426485511

9210062,comment,9203510,9203510,0,0,igodard,,,"The original of this discussion was a blog post on kevmod.com. I posted the following comment on that blog, repeated here verbatim as possibly of general interest:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Your skepticism is completely justified. The Mill may never reach market – we are a startup, and most startups fail; its a fact of life. Although we’ve survived for over a decade, which is pretty good for startups these days.<p>But it sounds like you are less skeptical about Mill Computing the company, but more about Mill the technology and architecture. There are fewer ground to doubt that. As fast as we have been able to get the patents filed (I seem to have been doing nothing else for the last two years. I <i>hate</i> patents) we have been completely opening the kimono and showing the technical community, in detail, how each part works. Why? because we wanted outside validation before wasting another decade in something that was fatally flawed in some way we had overlooked.<p>If there was any part of the public Mill that one could point at and say “See? that won’t work, because …” then the web would have been all over us. Buy you know? Skepticism we get, aplenty. What we don’t get is <i>informed</i> skepticism. In fact, the more senior and skilled the commenter, the more they fall in love with the design. Like Andy Glew said one time (and if you don’t know who that is then you are not in the CPU business) – “Yeah, it’ll work, just the way he says it will”.<p>Sometimes people complain that our presentations are insufficiently detailed to fairly evaluate. Guilty as charged; they are oriented for a high level audience interested in the subject, but not for the specialist. However, if you ask for details on our forum (mill computing.com/forum/themill) or the comp.arch newsgroup, as hundreds have, you will get all the details you want until they flood out your ears and collect in puddles on the floor.<p>In these days of internet time, when idea to market is measured in days or weeks, it’s east to forget that not all the economy works that way. Building steel mills, cement plants, and yes, CPU silicon takes a <i>long</i> time and a <i>lot</i> of money. We have deliberately swapped money for time: we are a bootstrap startup, not looking for VC funding. There’s good and bad in that choice: a decade without a paycheck is not easy, but today we own it – all of it – and feel we got a good deal.<p>The proof of the Mill pudding will be when there’s a product with pins on the bottom, and that won’t happen for some years yet. We learned in our first presentation not to make projections of what the eventual chip will have for numbers. Yes, we have guesstimates internally, but we’re quite sure those will be off by a factor of two. The problem is that we have no clue which direction they will be off.<p>If you have the technical chops to understand a CPU design from first principles then please dig as deep as you can into our stuff and tell us – and the world – what you find. Otherwise you will just have to join us as we wait and work and see. We’ve never said anything different.<p>Ivan",1426485298

But her example is pretty terrible.<p>My 2nd grade science fair project was making a book about the planets. I chose it because I thought space was cool.<p>All it involved was checking out space books from the school library and then putting a page for each planet in a binder with facts like how big the planet is or how far from the sun along with a hand drawn picture (ie a circle with moderately correct colors). I think there were some extra pages for the Sun and a random moon or two.<p>It could have easily been a trifold poster with most of the same stuff. I had loads of fun because I liked learning anything about space. It could have easily been about whales or something else if that&#x27;s what I was interested in. But all it took was some help from the school librarian: &quot;I want to do my science fair projects on planets. Do you have any books about planets?&quot;<p>The next year I found a book of experiments in the school library and did one of them and explained it on a trifold. It was fun and not rocket science. I think most of the &quot;experiments&quot; in the book required stuff like rubber bands, paper, and straws.<p>I&#x27;m not clear why finding a few books in the school library and making a trifold poster is a headache for an elementary school student.<p>After that I never attended a school with a science fair, but I think it was perfectly reasonable the few years I did participate.",1426485241

Dart&#x27;s type system, in particular its covariant subtyping unsoundness, outraged Andreas Rossberg of the new V8 team. He expressed himself plainly about this on LtU the other year:<p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4377#comment-67586"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4377#comment-67586</a><p>Andreas and many others among us TC39ers are well acquainted with Dart. I think this intra-Google, anti-Dart outrage motivated SoundScript, in part.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the &quot;data&quot; is out there on some Dart public wiki to inform SoundScript&#x27;s design in ways that programming language research and development do not already sufficiently inform it -- that we should just go get it, or we&#x27;re slackers. I think you know this.<p>Yes, all dynamic language VMs will look more alike in 10+ years. StrongScript or a closely related descendent of it in 5 still beats Dart, and I&#x27;m still right that this took too long by 5 years at least, precisely because of the bad politics and JS-can&#x27;t-be-fixed-but-it-can-be-replaced fallacies of the Dash memo that pre-forked and diverged Dart too much, without JS uplift apart from SIMD.<p>Are you done defending this sideshow as a productive experiment that helps the Web?

9210046,comment,9208501,9209836,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is certainly doable but you need to separate the <i>message</i> semantics from the <i>credit card</i> semantics. So lets say your authorization includes a nonce which is a blend of the transaction id data such that it is unique to the transaction. Now you send that through the message system which delivers it one or more times, but the <i>nonce</i> identifies all of them as the same transaction so the credit card processor tosses the &#x27;extra&#x27; ones away, it has already done the work. In such a system the message passing infrastructure needs to be at-least-once and the protocol involved insures that nothing bad happens if you deliver messages twice. Then you can route around damage or non-functioning nodes.<p>The reasoning at the protocol level then goes, &quot;If I have never seen this nonce, then the transaction has not been authorized&quot; (very durable, easy to implement), and &quot;A request seen multiple times will only be recorded once&quot; (also very durable and easy to implement).<p>But if the message infrastructure tries to guarantee at-most-once, and the user writes their protocol, &quot;if I see this authorization I should do it, because the protocol will only send it to me one time.&quot; Then there will come a time in that protocols future where something blew up the invariants in the message infrastructure and the message arrives twice, and the wrong thing happens on the credit card because the protocol trusts it to do the right thing.<p>Back in the RPC wars people were arguing that it was so much &quot;simpler&quot; and more &quot;transparent&quot; if a remote procedure call had the exact same semantics as a local procedure call. And that is true it would be, if you could manage that similarity, except it has been proven over and over again that network messaging systems can&#x27;t completely get it correct.",1426484827

While I can respect what he achieved and envy his good luck, he is hardly what many would call a good programmer. My standards may be different than others. He may code fast compared to some people (and slower than others), but code speed/output != productivity. Judging by the state of Minecraft and bug counts of what he&#x27;s done, one could do the same by shifting emphasis or priorities on getting something usable vs. bug free. It is more correct as you imply that other things are just as valuable or perhaps more. It all depends on context. N0tch might be a great prototype programmer, but a terrible programmer for writing banking software and sending things into space. We still don&#x27;t have many good ways to judge people, which is why dumb managers look at things like lines of code or total hours.<p>Indeed we know that many factors influence productivity - familiarity with the task and technologies involved, language choice, library choice, deadlines, environment, external influences, and so on. This sick culture of work will make you free is not a good one. I do believe though that many good developers who can work together in a group (very important) are better than having 100x as many people who are bad coders. It really depends how big or small a team is, how it is managed or not, and so on. Having a team of only the best coders isn&#x27;t enough and can actually seal the doom of a project.",1426482964

Eventually a few optimal approaches for the home will come out of that market process, similar to gaming today: you might have a basic controller, you might buy a driving wheel, you might install an entire flight simulator environment, all depending on how far you want to go to boost your experience.",1426482332

</code></pre>
So if my understanding is correct, wiping the contents of a re-joining mirror shouldn&#x27;t matter, since no new messages should have been accepted since the partition (unless the &quot;pause&quot; part of pause-minority is only happening after other things like re-election or dropping &quot;dead&quot; slaves, in which case yes pause-minority is useless - this seems doubtful, however).<p>Hence why I think the problem is synchronized slaves.<p>Basically, when a slave is created (eg. in response to another slave dying), it only receives NEW messages, not existing messages. So suppose the following sequence of events on a 2-mirror queue:<p><pre><code>    Publish A
    Master and slave both contain A
    Slave dies
    New slave created
    Master contains A; Slave contains nothing
    Publish B
    Master contains A,B ; Slave contains B
    Master dies
    Slave promoted and new slave created
    A is lost
</code></pre>
The way around this is with setting the policy &quot;ha-sync-mode&quot;: &quot;automatic&quot;. In which case the act of creating a new slave also replicates the current contents of the master. To the best of my knowledge, if the same Call Me Maybe tests were run with that policy in place, no messages should be lost.<p>But yes, this is precisely what I meant by &quot;fraught with pitfalls&quot;. The pause while messages replicate can be disastrous on its own if the queue is large, another issue that has bit me in production.<p>I do love RabbitMQ but I wish there was a good, planned-from-the-beginning as clustered CP AMQP broker out there. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to write one.",1426482287

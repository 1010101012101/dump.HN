If you look back to 1 year ago, it&#x27;s still up 40%. You don&#x27;t get 250% growth in 6 months without an accompanying correction cycle. The biggest problem with China right now is that it&#x27;s high on potential, but nobody knows what the right value should be. So it will continue to be volatile like this until there&#x27;s a better idea of if Chinese companies are creating real economic value or not and to what degree.",1440698386

Hypothetically the Fed can announce whatever it wants, but realistically it is extremely constrained in its actions at the moment.<p><i>Arguably, the most immediate risk from the Fed’s policies is that banks could use those newly created excess reserves too quickly. Banks now have an additional $2.6 trillion in excess reserves, which means that they can create up to approximately $26 trillion in new money.[21] In other words, banks now have the power to create more than twice the amount of money currently in the U.S. economy, thus heightening the risk of future inflation.[22] As the economy improves, the Fed may have to pay higher interest rates on these reserves to keep banks from dramatically increasing their lending. Paying higher rates, all else being constant, would exacerbate any “losses” suffered by the Fed, thus increasing the political problems discussed in this Backgrounder.<p>For those same political reasons, there are risks to the Fed simply holding all of these assets indefinitely because interest rates are expected to rise in the future. If those rates rise, the Fed would suffer “losses” due to paying higher rates on its liabilities than it receives on its assets, again putting the central bank in a difficult political position. Also, as the world’s largest debtor, the federal government is highly vulnerable to an interest rate shock that could make the federal budget deficit much worse. A rule of thumb is that every one percentage point rise in interest rates increases the budget deficit by about $1 trillion over a decade. The safest course of action, therefore, is to start undoing the QE policies by selling off these securities.<p>Securities sales are typically associated with contractionary monetary policies, but because these reserves are excess reserves, and since they have done little to increase economic activity in the first place, removing these reserves should not have an adverse impact on the economy. Nonetheless, the Fed should minimize any negative effects by announcing a deliberate plan to sell the bulk of these securities over, for instance, the next six years. The Fed can also partly offset (or sterilize) these sales with its normal temporary open-market purchases of short-term Treasuries.[23]</i><p><a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/08/quantitative-easing-the-feds-balance-sheet-and-central-bank-insolvency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/08/quantitativ...</a>",1440698053

General-purpose functional languages don&#x27;t have all that much to do with CH, and they don&#x27;t include any design decisions that favors a particular approach to verification. The type system helps you enforce useful invariants in your code and can make verification easier, but it&#x27;s completely orthogonal to how you can prove programs correct.<p>> I think C-H has so far disappointed, because 1., people don&#x27;t seem to want it, and 2. because other verification systems (like KeY) or the verifiable imperative, reactive real-time languages of the eighties (like Esterel) whose descendants are still in use today, have so far been used to much better effect.<p>Theorem provers based on C-H are general-purpose logics that can be used for a lot more than just program verification. So, different tools for a different purpose. Having said that, they have proven to be very useful for verification of complex systems like those you listed, where existing tools have trouble even stating what correctness means. That is, they can help us answer the question &quot;how can we be certain that this compiler, verification system, etc. is correct?&quot; That typically includes representing your object language in your theorem prover and proving things about the language, which is quite different than showing that an algorithm meets some specification.<p>> But the notion of subset => simpler is a mathematical notion with no relevance to cognition. If humans operated in this way, natural languages would have been much more mathematically simpler, too.<p>You can show that, quite literally, any &quot;true property&quot; of a program in your more complicated language is also true of the corresponding program in your simpler language. So, if you come to some correct conclusion, even if the way you reason is completely bogus and just happens to work, it will be valid for your simpler language.<p>There&#x27;s no need to solve the much, much harder (and poorly specified) problem of &quot;what is easiest for humans&quot;. That&#x27;s not to say that the current crop of functional languages is <i>presented</i> in the easiest way for people to understand, but that&#x27;s an entirely different problem independent of semantic considerations.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3i1l9n/from_imperative_to_purefunctional_and_back_again/cud0j10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3i1l9n/from_im...</a>",1440697236

They were also 15 times more likely to die than those without neck injuries [...]  There was no association of neck injury with helmet use, either in the entire group of patients with neck injury (OR=0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.4, adjusted for age)&quot;<p>&quot;Males were 2.4 times more likely, those hit by motor vehicles 14.1 times more likely, and those traveling at self reported speeds > 15 mph, 2.6 times more likely to be killed.&quot;<p>1. <a href=""http://bmj-injuryprev.highwire.org/content/3/2/110.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bmj-injuryprev.highwire.org/content/3/2/110.full.pdf</a><p>The point is that when you&#x27;re cycling or doing any activity, you expose yourself to a combination of risks.  I&#x27;ve never argued that helmet use isn&#x27;t a valid way to decrease certain risks (I wear mine daily when commuting in traffic, and sometimes when hitting the bike path out of the city I leave it at home), but it&#x27;s detrimental that we focus on that as the only cause of risk, because it causes people to ignore everything else.<p>People like telling other people to wear helmets because it&#x27;s an easy solution.  But it only (kind of) solves one problem, and even worse, it&#x27;s used as a scapegoat, a means to blame the victim.  A woman gets flattened into 2 dimensions by a tractor trailer while riding her bike, but what&#x27;s this?  She wasn&#x27;t wearing her helmet??  Come on people, wear your helmet!<p>It&#x27;s as if we were to address the entire issue of auto safety with &quot;wear a seatbelt!&quot; and considered the matter closed even if a kid who&#x27;s never driven before is going 100mph through a residential neighborhood with his eyes closed.",1440696520

One could read a patent, then change terms, rearrange parts, etc. until it was not at all clear that one&#x27;s own expression of the idea actually came from the patent.  I realize an independent invention defense seems natural to us as engineers, since we independently (re-)invent things all the time, but I don&#x27;t see how it would work as a matter of law.<p>And people wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to have read the actual patent in order to abuse such a defense -- they might just have seen the product that incorporates the invention.<p>As for how one would present evidence of non-obviousness, if you follow the link I gave, you&#x27;ll see three kinds of evidence which can support such a claim, according to the Supreme Court: commercial success; long-felt but unsolved needs; and failure of others.  I think what these all have in common is clear: you need to show that others have had an incentive to try to solve the same problem, but haven&#x27;t done so.  <i>That</i> would constitute evidence that the solution wasn&#x27;t obvious.<p>> It[&#x27;]s a bit easier to prove that something was obvious at the time of invention.

Keeping line L2 fixed, one gets a series of intersection points P as one varies the parameter s. One then notices that the point of intersection of line L2 and the parabola (the &quot;touching point&quot;) is the limit of these intersection points P as s tends toward the value t. The proof finishes by showing that this limit point is just what it was hypothesised to be, namely the point along line L2 that divides it in the same proportions as its endpoints divide the control lines.<p>I agree that some students will not recognise the crux of the proof, but will simply see something ends up being equal to something else in some identity without understanding how that relates to what was being proved.<p>Euclid&#x27;s Elements (an ancient Greek textbook on Geometry) is a good model in this regard.

It helps when you are exporting and hurts when you are importing. But it gets complicated:<p>Among the &#x27;importers&#x27; are consumers. Devaluing the yuan raises prices for imported goods and services, and goods containing imported components. In a way, devaluation taxes consumers to help exporting businesses (but it&#x27;s more complex: some consumers work for or otherwise do business with exporters, while some are connected similarly to importers).<p>Also among the importers are businesses who import components of the products they make, including goods, software, and services. Those importers just saw an across-the-board increase in their costs.<p>And there is import and export of debt. Those who owe money in another currency, usually US dollars, just saw an across-the-board increase in how much they owe. Those who are creditors in another currency just got an across-the-board bonus; however I suspect that most Chinese institutions would lend in their own currency. It also helps those importing assets; for example investors are more likely to put their money in China when they can buy yuan-denominated assets more cheaply.<p>In a free-floating currency and open market, exchange rates also affect domestic interest rates because the exchange rates affect demand by foreign investors. I&#x27;m not sure how China&#x27;s market works in that regard.<p>In the end it&#x27;s the government picking winners and losers, but if their economy or key sectors depend more heavily on exports than imports, certainly they could see a net gain.",1440695524

However the event loop does pose some challenges. One of the most important things to consider is that you should never block the event loop. [...] Now some great tools do exist for monitoring the event loop and if you understand the event loop and take care not to block it, then everything will most likely be fine. However you should be mindful of its strengths and limitations while developing.<p>I think the concurrency model provided by green threads in Go and Erlang is orders of magnitude easier to reason about, where you can write blocking I/O and the scheduler itself will take care of making sure that your code runs fine. The last thing I need when writing concurrent code is yet another thing to think about at every step of the way. This is a hugely underrated flaw in my opinion of node.js servers. With languages like Haskell, Rust, and Go we are seeing a trend of having smarter compilers and language runtimes making programs much easier to write, where I am offloading lots of things from my mind onto the compiler. The whole <i>point</i> of pre-emptive multi-tasking is to relieve the burden of &quot;taking care not to block [the event loop],&quot; and I think in that respect node.js is a step back.",1440695311

If you&#x27;re the one making the accusation, the onus is on you to support that with evidence.<p>The cultural narrative is to identify those who aren&#x27;t straight men as victims (women, LBGT). Drunk female has sex with drunk male? The female is a &quot;victim&quot; and not responsible for her actions, while the male gets kicked out of school (this happened at Occidental College). Female prostitute willingly has consensual sex with a man for $1,000? The male is a criminal and the woman is a victim (that&#x27;s the law in countries like Sweden, and I once spoke to a human trafficking prevention worker at a top non-profit who tried to convince me that all prostitutes are victims). Male tells a woman on the street she&#x27;s cute? Sexual harassment (unless he&#x27;s Brad Pitt).<p>And look at the media. Lead male celebrity actors in Hollywood movies get paid more than female leads? This is seen as a &quot;problem&quot; and must be the result of discrimination, and articles about it go viral on social media. Female models and pornstars get paid significantly more than their male counterparts? Supply and demand baby, nobody gives a shit.<p>The worst part is that it&#x27;s heresy for a straight male to even question assumptions of discrimination without being accused of misogyny.

I do feel that in many ways the Allies did things I personally would not have approved of, I still have no problems that they were done.<p>The problem as I see it with these discussions, much as you point out you are ignorant of WWII, is that too many people do not fully understand WWII. They look at it with their modern sensibilities and judge accordingly. This is extreme ignorance in action. The simplest reason is because we are now working on our second or third generation of separation of the time. We have not had a total war like there was with WWII. People are losing that perspective, that it was total war. I would imagine many recent college grads don&#x27;t even realize what the term total war means.<p>So, why do I not have a problem with the nuclear bombings of Japan and the potential invasion? Because the Japanese were the aggressors. I have little problems with the actions of people defending themselves against aggression.",1440694970

I feel like, it could be made to work, but the boundary would have to be quite heavy-weight. Think less gradual typing and more FFI.<p>Edit: actually, in depends on which side is doing the calling. Going from checked to unchecked code is a minefield, but if it&#x27;s unchecked code calling into checked code, it could work quite well as long as the arguments are immutable and don&#x27;t have methods that can do IO.",1440694892

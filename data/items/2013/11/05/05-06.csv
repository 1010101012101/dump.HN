Brute forcing the key is, as I understand it, still very difficult, and without it they can&#x27;t get any of the passwords. If someone did find the key however, they&#x27;d have instant access to all of the passwords no matter how complex.<p>On the other hand, if the passwords had been protected using an unsuitable hash algorithm, the highly efficient GPU-based crackers would be able to find millions of people&#x27;s passwords very quickly, using the sophisticated dictionaries and mangling techniques that are around now. Even quite complex passwords can often be found in this way, since the GPU crackers have got so fast they can try billions of combinations - e.g. even things like &quot;!)@(#*$&%^Test123&quot; can be cracked. [1] [2]. Although, extremely long and complex passwords should be safe.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m not advocating we all switch to 3DES for our password storage, and the huge risk here is that the key was also stolen - but I&#x27;m wondering if my reasoning is actually right here, and that people without extremely strong passwords are better off with this leak than if it&#x27;d been MD5.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-mi...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-yo...</a>",1383630306

My assumption is because they were interested in <i>past</i> communication that might have already been deleted (perhaps by Snowden).  We now know that the US government often logs and stores ciphertext, and we know that Lavabit was not selecting PFS SSL cipher suites.<p>So when Ladar did eventually provide the SSL key to the government, it&#x27;s likely that the government was able to use that to decrypt all previously stored traffic and obtain the entire history of transmitted email.<p>So it&#x27;s quite likely that Snowden (and all other Lavabit users) did have their email read by the government.",1383630016

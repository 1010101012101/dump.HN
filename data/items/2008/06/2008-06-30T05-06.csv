From the opposite, Atomkeep wants other networks to own your profile and it'll do the ""dirty"" job for you on syncing it.  JobScore will never be as much effective, as just keeping your resume in Monster, Dice and Jobster simultaneously.  JobScore looks like a good partner for Atomkeep, though.",1214804792

The company gets value out of mental focus, not in having an ass in a chair-- so, if people are more focused and motivated with an extra two hours available for other activities (family, friends, what have you) then it is a net gain for the company.",1214803873

What if the forger gets hold of pre-war paint, or purifies paint personally, or forged the painting before atomic testing?  I don't know how viable or common these methods are, but they could make this testing process less useful in the future.  Of course, identifying fakes between 1945 and 2008 is still an awesome contribution.",1214803181

231730,comment,231153,231553,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"I've studied Islam in depth, and can answer this question.<p>Islam calls for the presence of an Islamic state, which may live in coexistence with other non-Islamic states in peace. Within the Islamic state, all <i>Muslims</i> are held to the Islamic laws, but non-Muslims are free to practice and preach their own religions. Muslims are required to serve in the army of said Islamic state, whereas non-Muslims aren't allowed to - they pay an extra tax (Islamic tax is 2.5%) instead. So long as the tax is paid, they are considered to be full citizens and have most rights (with some rights related to the Islamic-religion obviously excepted).<p>Islam (in the Quran) <i>does</i> say to kill the ""disbelievers,"" but this is almost always immediately followed by conditionals. Generally, the conditionals will refer to ""those that have invoked violence upon you"" and ""those that have taken your lands or people from you."" And then it's directly followed on most occasions by another statement: ""And God doesn't forbid you from making peace with those that aren't fighting you and haven't taken your property.""<p>So Islam demands the presence of a non-Secular entity (not dis-similar to the Vatican) which gives preference to Muslims, but does not require that there be a ""Islamic World Order"" and domination of the planet. Within the Islamic empire, non-Muslims are free to practice their own religions and <i>their rights to do so are protected by Islam</i> and outside its boundaries other countries are obviously free to do whatever they like so long as there are no transgressions - just like modern politics dictates.<p>It's important to note that in the history of the Islamic empire, there were great periods of tolerance and coexistence with the non-Muslim world. Take, for instance, Jerusalem when it was handed off from Christian hands to the Caliph Omar some 15 years after the spread of Islam. They would trust it to one other than the Caliph himself, and it was understood & accepted by both sides that it would remain - like the rest of the Islamic empire at the time (with the city of Makkah, where only Muslims are allowed to reside, being the exception) - open for Christians and Muslims alike without fear of religious prosecution or interference - and so it did.",1214802673

231725,comment,231621,231711,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, that's an awful argument for legalization, but I do think that we need to either ban alcohol or legalize pot for the sake of consistency. Alcohol is an addictive substance that kills lots of people[1] directly through toxicity and indirectly through impaired judgment. Pot is not physiologically addictive and is nontoxic for all practical purposes[2], and the worst that can happen while stoned is that you waste a lot of time or anger your roommate by eating his cheetos.<p>FWIW, I say legalize both, use it in a safe environment or not at all, don't drive or operate heavy machinery, don't let it derail your life, etc.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.csdp.org/research/1238.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csdp.org/research/1238.pdf</a>  (Looks like we should ban tobacco too.)<p>2.

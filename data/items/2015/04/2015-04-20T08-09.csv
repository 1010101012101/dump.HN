The future will be a leaser society. Part os this have come about. There are a lot more services and a bigger portion of total consumption allocated to various optional or &quot;lifestyle&quot; decisions. Most of us working in &quot;developed economies&quot; can certainly afford as many plates and electric kettles as we can use easily. In my grandmother&#x27;s time, you got plates and sugar bowls for your wedding and your inheritance and tried not to break too many in between. But, some fundamental &quot;human condition&quot; issues have gone unsolved?<p>When I first thought about these things as a kid I didn&#x27;t know that people had been making the same speculations for nearly 100 years.<p>I don&#x27;t really know to say &#x27;why.&#x27; But, I do think a good chunk of our consumption is competitive, and therefore resistant to adequacy. Real estate is competitive. Schooling is competitive. Status symbols are competitive. You can own the latest gadget for cheap, if you&#x27;re willing to wait five years until prices drop (what would be the price of a brand new iphone 1 in 2015?).<p>Anyway… I think it&#x27;s unhelpful to great improvements with cynicism. 2 days a month is a decent starting point. If you really want to work on whatever you want to work on without financial considerations.. you need to figure out a way of doing it for yourself. Otherwise, 2 days is not bad.",1429520324

Worldwide, only about 22% of parliamentarians (MPs, representatives, etc) are women. I&#x27;m pretty sure women make up more than 22% of the population.<p>We were talking about the US.  I have little interest in what other countries do unless it becomes a problem for mine.<p>>There&#x27;s also a never-ending raft of laws, especially in the US, aimed at controlling women&#x27;s access to health care...<p>If by that you mean adding restrictions to infanticide, well, I suppose they get proposed on a regular basis.  They hardly ever pass, though, and when they do they&#x27;re gutted by the courts.  Not what I&#x27;d describe as a &quot;never-ending raft&quot;.  More like a soggy paper boat.<p>>As for all this talk about who gets criticized, you make it sound like white men have, in addition to political dominance, unimaginably thin skin and sensitive constitutions.<p>Nice try.  Just because I draw your attention to a double standard doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m ready to run to a &quot;safe space&quot;.  I&#x27;m simply pointing out white men, at 30% of the population, don&#x27;t control the country.<p>If men <i>actually</i> had &quot;political dominance&quot; we&#x27;d have laws against paternity fraud.  And you wouldn&#x27;t be able to sponge off your ex after deciding you weren&#x27;t that into him any more.  Women pay less than half the health care dollars and yet they use 2/3 of the services.  That hardly seems fair, does it?<p>But no.  More than half the voters are women complaining about having no power while at the same time calling the shots.",1429519975

The teacher&#x27;s knowledge, and his ability to condense it into a synthetic form (here a book), remains as valuable as before, if not more. Teachers currently have to use the Ivy league bureaucracy in order to turn those skills into a livelihood, but that can be changed.<p>Schools destroy kids&#x27; curiosity and self-confidence, although those are the best individual learning drivers. That&#x27;s not (only) willful sabotage: the problem is, those drivers are well suited for tailor-made education, but they&#x27;re considered unmanageable to handle batches of hundreds or thousands of kids.

Why are those groups of people not worthy of support, full-throated or otherwise?<p>I didn&#x27;t say they shouldn&#x27;t.  I was merely pointing out these groups get no more in the way of negative messaging from the media than white men.  Quite a bit less, actually.<p>>If those groups are now working to obtain more economic and political power, in a world that has historically and remains economically and politically skewed against them, why would anyone not support that?<p>Why indeed?  Maybe because they already have political power in proportion to their size?  More so, in fact - if you want to know who&#x27;s in charge all you need to do is find out who you can&#x27;t criticize.  White men, at what, about 30% of the US population, seem to be quite safe to criticize, wouldn&#x27;t you say?",1429517136

who aren&#x27;t<p>I see. Thanks for the explanation.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind  I have a follow-up question -- actually two related ones.  The approach you are suggesting is essentially about  ethics and epistemology at an individual level. What I wonder is, how, if at all, should it extrapolate  to government action? I.e., to what degree should government decisions about aiding people who are at a disadvantage be informed by listening to them  versus dispassionate observation and statistics?<p>I ask because  &quot;listening&quot; is inherently hard to &quot;scale&quot; to a national level in a large nation.  In a  Western liberal democracy the usual answer on how to do this seems to be &quot;voting.&quot;
In practice besides voting the supposed public voice of any disadvantaged group is also shaped by self-appointed spokesmen for the disadvantaged, typically journalists and academics. Personally, I have little faith in either  doing more good than harm.<p>My second question is, how should it be determined  who is considered advantaged and who is considered disadvantaged?",1429516934

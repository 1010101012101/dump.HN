4423881,comment,4421684,4423083,2,0,ljscharen,,,"Another concrete example is to define BL and BW as any point at which a game B has a negative or positive expectation.  A real-life example of using the A, BL, BW strategy were the MIT blackjack teams of the 80's and 90's.<p>They had a spotter at each table that would count cards and wait until the odds were in the player's favor before calling in the big money player.  Assuming that the bets placed by the spotter are negligible, the the big money player could choose from the following games:<p><pre><code>   A : Do nothing. E[x] = 0  (break-even)\n   BL: Play blackjack when the deck favors the casino, E[x] < 0\n   BW: Play blackjack when the deck favors the player, E[x] > 0\n</code></pre>\nObviously playing blackjack has negative expectation in the long run, and we could choose another casino game with very-close-to even odds for game A (like Baccarat), rather than doing nothing.",1345744722

Some of these comments are accurate but I wanted to clear things up.<p>Not all acquihires are the same, so my experience is surely different from others, but there could be a number of reasons why founders would decide to be acquihired. Job security, higher pay, you get to solve the same problem you're passionate about but on a much larger scale, you have more resources to do what you need to do, you get to build a larger team than you would have been able to previously, you get to work with some amazing people and learn from them, you get an exit under your belt which looks good if you decide to do another startup in the future.<p>As far as why a company would want to acquihire a team? The team dynamic is more valuable than building a team from scratch. The team has proven they can design, build, and deliver a product. I'm willing to bet that 100% of the founders that get acquihired have domain knowledge of the product they work on, and that can be valuable to a large company that is trying to build a new business unit and may not know that industry as well. Corporations need to move fast to please investors, so often times it's easier for them to acquire a team that knows an industry rather than launch a new business unit and learn as they go.<p>I've seen so many people on HN complain when a company gets acqihired...but I bet that the majority of you would take the same deal given the opportunity. Sure it can be seen as selfish, but sometimes you have to do what's best for yourself, your career, and your family.",1345744420

4423842,comment,4422971,4422971,1,0,ggchappell,,,"This is interesting stuff, but I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around some of it. Here are some thoughts.<p>(1) Prohibiting function return values sounds bizarre at first. It's like anti-functional programming -- <i>insisting</i> on side effects. But eventually I understood the reason: a returned object might have methods called on it. This is bad because such objects are ""strangers"" (in the LoD sense); we should not talk to them.<p>I guess the point is that traditional OO and functional style do not mix well. You can do state-modifying OO stuff, or you can work entirely with return values; you mix the two at your peril.<p>Or maybe the real problem is the everything-is-a-mutable-object idea. Applying these ideas to programming in C++, we could return an int without fear, since there are no methods to be called on it. We could also return a const object (I think ...). In Python, we could return anything immutable: integer, string, tuple, frozenset, etc.<p>(2) Concerning error handling, I see that prohibiting return values (which also forbids raising exceptions, I guess), makes it difficult for a function to signal errors to the caller. However, I do not agree that such signalling becomes <i>impossible</i>. A method is allowed to modify its arguments; it can signal an error that way.<p>But I'm a bit leery of the idea that requiring every function to handle its own errors, will result in more robust code. The argument seems to be that, since you have to write the error handling at the same time you're writing the code that produces the error, you're more likely to get it done. I'm not sure of that. I think the main trouble with error handling is that it requires work, and most of us don't really want to do that work. If a certain discipline helps motivate one person to write proper error handling, well, good, but it may not effectively motivate another person.<p>To put it another way: these ideas make some kinds of error handling more difficult. Does making something more difficult help it to get done?<p>But I haven't really thought this particular issue through. Prohibiting error signalling is going to have significant effects on software architecture at all levels. Some abstractions will simply be impossible, since they do not have all the information necessary for the handling of their own errors. I'm not at all sure what these effects might look like.<p>(3) Then there are the timing issues.<p>> There cannot be tight synchronization, as the sender cannot tell if the message is acted on or not within any ""small"" period of time ....<p>I don't get this at all.",1345744330

Campbell is highly critical of the first Nurses' Health Study (established 1976), calling it one of the chief sources of public misinformation about nutrition.[8]<p>In a written debate with Campbell in 2008, Dr. Loren Cordain, a professor in the Department of Health and Exercise Science at Colorado State University, argued that ""the fundamental logic underlying Colin's hypothesis (that low protein diets improve human health) is untenable and inconsistent with the evolution of our own species,"" and that ""a large body of experimental evidence now demonstrates a higher intake of lean animal protein reduces the risk for gout, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, and osteoporosis while not impairing kidney function."" Campbell responded by questioning the implications of the evidence Cordain noted, and argued that ""diet-disease associations observed in contemporary times are far more meaningful than what might have occurred during evolutionary timesat least since the last 2.5 million years or so.""[31] Cordain's rebuttal countered that contemporary hypothesis regarding ""what modern day humans should and shouldnt eat must be consistent with the system and the ancient environmental selective pressures that engineered our current genes,"" and that ""there is no credible fossil, archeological, anthropological, anatomical, ethnographic or biochemical evidence to show that members of our genus (Homo) routinely consumed low protein diets. In fact, without the inclusion of energetically dense animal food into the hominin diet, starting at least 2.5 million years ago, our large energetically active brains would not have evolved.""",1345743636

The offer structure was some cash (this all went to the investors), some restricted stock in the acquiring company for the people wanted, and regular interviews (no guarantee of a hire) with everyone else. So the founder who wasn't part of the 'deal' was offered the interview but not the restricted stock + job.<p>In this particular case the acquiring company's stock was publicly traded so the restricted stock was essentially a payout once the core team demonstrated they could bring their ability to deliver in house. The restricted stock 'unlocked' (which is to say it transferred over to founders) in two tranches one at 18 months and one at 36 months.<p>When I looked at it I felt it was a better deal than the key players would have gotten if they had approached the company individually, and the way in which the restricted stock unlocked was structured so that as long as folks stayed for a year and remained in good standing (which is to say their new management was happy with their performance) the first half of the stock was guaranteed even if they left before 18 months.<p>Probably more detail than was necessary but the bottom line was that the acquiring company made it worthwhile for the key employees to come over as a team (and parts of the deal were structured such that if they didn't come over as a team the deal was off).",1345743501

There is nothing wrong with that if customers are getting something out of the greater consumption, but it is a deadweight loss on the economy if they aren't. In fact, if they gain enough pleasure out of being spiteful, that is a justifiable reason, I merely suspect that they wouldn't actually enjoy it that much.<p>As for monthly commit services, providers choose them over usage billing because it smooths out their capacity projection needs.

Friends are ready to stay 24/7 online, and I can go online whenever I please. New social networks sprout everywhere like mushrooms, old ones hastily pump up their functionality. It is a norm today to have 10 accounts at various services.<p>Yet, the more we have, the more conspicuous is the problem spreading over the Internet of our days: it is the issue of the content which is adequate for the concrete user. As it often happens, quantitative development is inversely proportional to the qualitative one. New social networks produced in a familiar format are fun at best, but quite useless precisely due to their derivative nature.\n<i></i>\nSo, an extensive use of the unsubscribe function (that allows a break in subscription to messages without breaking the connection with a friend) in Facebook is a sign of tighter content requirements. Unsubscribe is swiftly catching up with like in popularity. We are happy to communicate with people, but we never fully match with them. And that is normal, it is just what we have in our offline life. It is fun to discuss movies with John, or to speak to Michael about his recent crazy trip, but it is boring to discuss other things with them, and you dont feel like offending them by unfriending (no matter how ridiculous such offence might look).<p>As a result, messages from persons, whose opinions I am not interested in, build up to form dense information noise. In the intense past the time we fell in love with social networks (Ive got many friends at any hour of the day), this noise was fun. In the present, when we are fed up with communication, we feel the need for reliable information. Social networks seem to be ideal for getting advice. But this info noise pulls the quality of such advice down. A user having thousands friends does not enjoy any informational advantages.<p>What do you think?",1345742917

If it were possible to have as few shortages with less spoilage, that would be a pareto efficient improvement that did not entail a tradeoff. If you could have an emergency food supply without throwing out as much food, you'd have less waste, but if you stop stocking up for emergencies then you lose the utility of the security you get from having an emergency supply. You could forgo this security, but it isn't possible to analyze whether this would be <i>better</i> without good information on the exposure to risks and perfect insight into your own preferences, and how you might rank the security in comparison to the next best thing you'd purchase.<p>It is a parallel situation to the main purpose\* of insurance. In the general case, the odds of a bad event occurring multiplied by the cost of paying for that event will always be less than the cost of purchasing insurance to cover that event. However, buying insurance is not implicitly an inefficient decision, because you are buying with insurance is some of the insurer's higher risk tolerance, obtained by pooling together all of its clients' risk.<p>\* There are some other dynamics at play. Information asymmetries mean that the insurance companies actuaries may have a better idea of your actual risk than you do, and you may privately know that you will do something more risky than you lead them to believe. Furthermore, in the case of health insurance you are also purchasing the insurer's bargaining expertise which can dramatically lower how much is paid for a procedure.",1345742085

With respect, no one could contemplate that snapping a leaf from a tree would be worthy of a patent, whereas isolating genes to provide useful diagnostic tools and medicines is surely what the patent laws are intended to encourage and protect.

You don't need to guarantee results to sell a worthwhile book, and IMHO you shouldn't.<p>Here's why:<p>1. Let's say you have a profit margin of 20% on your book overall -- printing costs, promotion, etc. versus income.<p>2. Let's also say that 80% of your book's readers do increase their client base as you claim.<p>3. The problem is that the remaining 20% can take you at your word, demand a refund, explain that the book was lost in a fire, and succeed in wiping out your profit.<p>4. Worse, someone might say your claim moved your book from the category of an ordinary caveat-emptor purchase, to a guarantee of success, and demand consequential damages. Very bad, and you made it possible.<p>It works like this: Because of the First Amendment, an author can say virtually anything in a book -- anything. But when you make a claim about a book's contents to motivate sales, you short-circuit First Amendment protections -- you turn your book from a freely expressed opinion, to a method with a guaranteed outcome. Very bad idea.<p>> Paying for stuff that doesn't deliver value is dumb.<p>Not as dumb as making an unnecessary claim that has a potentially disastrous outcome.<p>Just my opinion, expressed in words, with no guarantees.",1345741221

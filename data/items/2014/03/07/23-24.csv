7363539,comment,7288884,7290829,1,0,ptx,,,"> Yes, with Perl::Tidy and one keyboard shortcut bound to it. With Python I have to manually and very carefully block-indent the pasted fragment and then figure out how it fits into existing code.<p>No need to do it carefully or manually. The indentation within the fragment will be <i>internally</i> consistent, as will the indentation in the existing code you&#x27;re pasting it into. So you just have to figure out the difference in indentation level between the two and use whatever keyboard command your editor has (e.g. C-c < and C-c > in Emacs) to shift the whole fragment.<p>> Even if there were a proper Python code formatter (hint: there isn&#x27;t anything even close in functionality to Perl::Tidy) it wouldn&#x27;t be able to figure out the code, since whitespace is significant. No such thing in Perl -- paste, tidy, rinse and repeat.<p>Right, but in Python there is no such thing as reformatting. The information about the structure is already encoded in the indentation, so it&#x27;s neither possible nor necessary to reconstruct it from other formatting characters.<p>In other words, whereas in Perl and C-like languages you would 1) edit the braces so that they&#x27;re correct and then 2) automatically reconstruct the indentation to match the braces, in Python you simply 1) edit the indentation so that it&#x27;s correct.",1394236511

For anything that approaches professional typesetting requirements, XML is a nightmare.<p>By far the biggest problem, it the requirement that inner elements must be closed before outer ones can be. This frequently means that the software must do a huge amount of read-ahead to figure out which aspect of the formatting changes first to make that formatting element innermost.<p>Sometimes, that&#x27;s simply not possible to arrange and so you have to close a whole bunch of elements and then reopen all but one of them.<p>All this because a constraint of the format.<p>Ideal formats, such as used by typesetting systems that don&#x27;t use XML, allow you to say: keep this formatting trait on until it&#x27;s switched off.

When you re-create an argument or diagram on paper you force yourself to work out the wrinkles and pay attention to the details in a way that you never do if you&#x27;re just staring at a slide. However, not all lectures work that way unless you consistently take classes below your level. Sometimes you get hung up on a concept and you&#x27;re forced to do two things at once:<p>1) copy the text & diagrams verbatim<p>2) understand the material<p>where #1 is significantly more cognitively demanding than reproducing an argument that you already understand (unless you have photographic memory, you look back and forth and back and forth) to the point that it inhibits #2, which creates a further need for #1 in a spiral of uninterrupted misery and needless failure.<p>This is where premade notes shine. They don&#x27;t have to be a .ppt (I&#x27;d prefer if they were TeX sheets or a book chapter, assuming the book chapter actually corresponds to the same material) but they have to be there if you want students to be able to occasionally focus 100% on what you&#x27;re saying.<p>Looking back on my LiveScribe archive, I notice a paradoxical trend: I took significantly better notes in classes that had support from solid permanent materials. Why? Because I was able to stop taking notes, focus, and fill things in later when appropriate as opposed to trying and failing to do #1 and #2 at the same time.",1394235882

It&#x27;s also not inherently unsustainable to make ever increasing amounts of money, because the economy can grow with you; it&#x27;s not a zero sum game.<p>That said, you&#x27;re right that a lot of companies totally bone themselves trying to grow unsustainably, letting the stability of their company (like customer happiness, employee retention, that sort of thing) fall apart in the meantime, and then collapse under their own weight. While I think the parent is wrong about how it applies to Quark, they&#x27;re quite right that the incentives for short-term growth are driven by how the stock market works. It may have even tilted our whole business culture to worship growth regardless of context.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works. Let&#x27;s assume a simplified version of the stock market in which stocks are priced based on the current performance of the company [1]. So let&#x27;s say I buy stock at IBM today for $188/share. IBM makes fucktons of money, which is great for IBM but useless to me. It&#x27;s useless to me because that&#x27;s what determined the price in the first place, so if it keeps on making the same number of fucktons then the price is going to stay at $188 and my money is just sitting out there doing nothing for me. What I need to happen is for the stock to be worth, say $200 so I can sell it and make some money. So I need IBM to grow. As much as possible. In fact, it&#x27;s the only thing I care about, because after I sell the stock I don&#x27;t care what happens to the company. So I vote to put people on the board who want to grow the company and they hire executives with that mandate (who are anyway paid in part with stock and thus have the same incentive) and the whole corporate culture aspires to growth at all costs. If they said &quot;well guys, this year growth isn&#x27;t really going to work and will probably just sink the ship, so we&#x27;re going to spend our time making our customers happy and pocketing our billions in profits&quot; everyone would sell the stock, the board would be fired, etc. So that&#x27;s why you have to grow. [2]<p>[1] That&#x27;s not <i>really</i> how it works; expectations of future growth are baked into the current price. Sort of. The relationship between a company&#x27;s performance, growth, dividends, and the overall economy is complicated, but it doesn&#x27;t really change the point much, which is that as an investor, you want the stock price to go up, and to do that, you need as much growth as possible.<p>[2] Following on from [1], there&#x27;s the argument that in a world with perfect information and rational actors, if the expected future growth is priced in, then sacrificing long term sustainability for short term growth wouldn&#x27;t raise the price. But we don&#x27;t live in that world.",1394235710

Learning <i>is</i> better when you aren&#x27;t able to diddle on your laptop or phone, and having to write things down strongly encourages you not to do those things, but the actual act of writing things down forces you to focus on quickly copying text, which hugely impairs your ability to internalize what was said.<p>Some people&#x27;s learning styles might make that less of a problem (i.e. so-called auditory learners might be able to internalize what&#x27;s being said nearly at the speed it&#x27;s spoken), but for those of us who need to translate what we hear into our own mental language, constant note-taking substantially hampers the learning process.<p>The ideal for me is to preview the notes of a lecture before it&#x27;s given a la Khan Academy, pay full attention during the lecture, occasionally jot down a keyword to trigger the memory of a thought I had during the lecture, and if I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to preview the lecture notes then I&#x27;ll want to be able to access them afterwards to look up anything I don&#x27;t remember.<p>Edit: Corrective upvote because you didn&#x27;t say anything that harms the discussion.",1394234380

Unfortunately, some clueless firewall administrators, such as those responsible for AWS EC2, do filter all ICMP because they for unknown reasons consider it to be bad, thus breaking PMTUD, which can lead to hanging TCP connections.<p>- TCP sequence numbers are for bytes, always, with the special case of SYN and FIN also counting as &quot;bytes&quot; in the sequence, but never for segments.",1394234354

We did a lot of listening with various streaming devices, and every time changing the connection to the streamer made a big difference. We also experimented with the connection between router and hard drive, and yes this bought improvements, but the most important connection is the one to the streamer.  This difference was noticeable regardless of whether we were running the cable directly to a router or via a pre-installed Ethernet cable network or a system where the Ethernet signal is carried over the mains.<p>This bit appears to break UK advertising regations about legal decent honest and truthful.

But if you are giving a 30-minute workshop, a 30-minute talk to a larger group of people, whiteboard-free-style presentation breaks down.<p>The main problem is that only a handful of people will fully comprehend what the speaker is up to regardless of which method. Some people are slower at picking up new ideas. It could be experience, language barrier (and sometimes it&#x27;s the speaker&#x27;s accent) or misunderstanding. People fear of asking dumb questions in front of a large group of experts so in the end it&#x27;s just an interaction of the speaker with a handful of experts. The rest will just nod and follow on.<p>Neither powerpoint nor whiteboard could solve the main problem entirely. But with powerpoint, one could traverse back and forth and audience does not have to suffer illegible handwriting (and in large group people could be sitting in the far back). This is something whiteboard-only discussion can&#x27;t.<p>So if they run a small group discussion, chalkboard is fine.

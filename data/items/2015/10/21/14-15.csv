The extra time spent loading an additional library dependency would be amortized over the total execution time of the program -- <i>IF</i> -- the program makes repeated use of the library.<p>If a js file only has a single getElementById() call, substituting that with a JQuery library to get the &quot;$&quot; syntax would be overkill.[1]  Howevever, if the javascript has many complicated DOM selects and bunch of animations, the extra JQuery load time can be justified.<p>One of the reasons to use a library the author didn&#x27;t touch on was &quot;insurance against unknown edge cases.&quot;  For example, I could attempt to write 50 lines of code to uppercase a lowercase Unicode string.  However, my attempt would have <i>bugs</i> in it.  Instead, it would be more prudent to use the ICU library.  It&#x27;s a hassle to add that dependency and it&#x27;s many thousands of lines more than my &quot;simple&quot; program but the ICU developers covered more edge cases than I ever thought of.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif</a>",1445439588

10425846,comment,10413861,10419169,0,0,AYBABTME,,,"In all other cases I&#x27;d want the compiler to break my code. The problem here is that this technique is very fallible, the chance for false negative, undetected errors is high. It&#x27;s risky because there&#x27;s a ton of cases where you won&#x27;t get a compiler error. It&#x27;s unduly making you feel safe, which is not a good thing in my opinion. This is mostly why I think it&#x27;s risky, because you feel safe when you shouldn&#x27;t.<p>With keyed-fields, the worst case is that you have uninitialized fields, which typically doesn&#x27;t cause much problems and get caught quickly where it matters. With unkeyed-fields, you might have code that compiles but sets unexpected fields. Things that would otherwise panic, now just keep working without you noticing, until strange things happen and you have to review all initializations and remember the struct layout every time you see the struct being created.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like both techniques anyways. It&#x27;s too error prone. I&#x27;ll prefer writing a small constructor where I handle initialization deliberately. It&#x27;s not super Go-ish but at least I centralize all the issues surrounding struct initialization in 1 place: the constructor. Then when I change what fields go in the struct, I change the function signature and the compiler breaks and doesn&#x27;t let things fall through silently.",1445439418

If you&#x27;re not passing the backbone models to React components, this sounds fine. backbone models as props ends up being really painful because of how mutable they are, and when we tried to manage that with mixins, it was buggy and caused problems (note: I&#x27;m not familiar with the actual mixin we used there and whether there was a better way to do it). Since most flux implementations are pretty stateful/mutable themselves, using mutable backbone models there, <i>so long as you copy data out to pass to react views</i>, seems safe. Though I&#x27;m excited long-term about the immutable flux implementations (<a href=""https://github.com/rackt/redux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/redux</a>)<p>2. We had a library originally written by Ben Alpert (now core react team) that handles all of our interactive svgs [1]. Since KA has a lot of legacy code there, and there hasn&#x27;t been an immediate benefit to porting it (which would take a pretty significant time investment, on the [very roughly] order of a couple dev-months), this is still mutable jQuery/raphael code. There have been a lot of talks of eventually porting this to react, but the immediate need for it hasn&#x27;t been there yet. However, I did write a React wrapper around much of this code which is used by newer interactive widgets [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/blob/master/utils/graphie.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/blob/master/utils/gra...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/Khan/perseus/blob/master/src/components/graphie.jsx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Khan/perseus/blob/master/src/components/g...</a>",1445438933

It will adjust metabolic functions to slow down weight loss by any means possible.  When the restriction ends, some of those switches do not get toggled back to their previous state.  So if you have ever tried a diet that included severe calorie restrictions or extended fasting, you may forevermore find it much easier to gain weight than lose it.<p>So if you want to go by the thermodynamic hypothesis, it is far safer for you in the long run to hold your diet constant and either increase exercise or thermogenesis (i.e. live through a winter at one of the poles).<p>Channel swimmers burn about 40 Mcal of energy.  Marathon runners burn about 3 Mcal.  But their bodies will prefer to use up all glycogen stores before digging in to body fat, and now some will eat glycogen gel during the event to avoid &quot;hitting the wall&quot; entirely.  Fat-burning is maximized only after depleting glycogen, or when exercising below the aerobic threshold (and possibly also below the lactate threshold), between 60% and 70% of your maximum heart rate.  Obviously, this would ordinarily set a hard limit on the number of kcal you can reasonably expend via exercise to lose body fat.<p>Thus, the uncanny effectiveness of ketogenic diets and &quot;bonk training&quot;.  Those practices intentionally deplete glycogen stores beforehand, so any exercise done in that state burns more body fat, regardless of your exercise intensity.  Ordinarily, you could have 1500 kcal or more of glycogen stores.  That&#x27;s enough for 15 miles of running, or 2 hours of cycling.  And that&#x27;s a lot of exercise to do before you start to get more permanent fat-loss results.<p>It is much easier to eat just enough protein to serve the short-term needs of your body, eat the remaining caloric requirement to avoid switching to starvation mode as fat, and avoid all carbohydrates like the plague.  Your body converts only as much protein as it needs into sugars, but not enough to replenish its glycogen, and switches to using fat as its primary energy supply, so any additional kcal you expend are coming directly from adipose reserves.  (This sort of lifestyle may have unintended side effects.)<p>People don&#x27;t want to just &quot;lose weight&quot;.  When they say that, they usually mean &quot;lose fat&quot;.  And that goal is a lot more complex than just kcal in minus kcal out.<p>We still don&#x27;t <i>fully</i> understand how diet, exercise, metabolism, and appetite work together to produce visible effects on the body.

In fact the police commonly refer to dealers on Grand, almost endearingly, as Alligators. Because they just sit out on the corners all day soaking up sun and scuttle away when necessary.  Ask any Coral Gables cop why they don&#x27;t &quot;shut down&quot; the dealing on Grand Avenue, the response is, well when dealers can&#x27;t make money with drugs they arm themselves and follow the road into Coconut Grove to commit robberies.  As a result there is an unspoken agreement, Grand Avenue is the dealers&#x27; so long as there is no spill over into Coconut Grove.  When times are good, in many of the drug neighborhoods in Miami not just off Grand Avenue, it is often said rich white people are the safest people in these neighborhoods because they are protected customers.<p>I am a criminal defense lawyer in South Florida, but its not exactly as you say, I don&#x27;t have an interest in maintaining the laws as is.

And then comes Galileo with a theory that&#x27;s inferior, built on arbitrary assumptions, doesn&#x27;t agree with observation and fails to match the predictive capabilities of established models.<p>The strength of a model is its ability to predict the future, and therefore no sane, rational person could accept Galileo&#x27;s model over the common ones based on the evidence they collected and analyzed so far. That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;enough evidence to promote one model over another&quot;. It eventually took Newton, few decades later, to basically sort things out by providing a) an actual explanation for why stuff would orbit other stuff, and b) mathematical model that spat out better predictions than the previous models did while being also simpler. And only then scientific world moved to accept the new picture - when it became the one that matched available evidence the best (it still took a few hundred years to sort out the kinks though).<p>People in times of Galileo weren&#x27;t stupid, the Church wasn&#x27;t supressing astronomy, and Galileo himself got sacked for being an ass to authority.",1445438456

A diabetic person can&#x27;t handle spikes in blood sugar, while a normal person can without consequence.<p>What is interesting is the mechanism that causes low glycemic food to digest slower. It&#x27;s the fiber! Processed Uncle Ben&#x27;s has .6 grams of dietary fiber per serving while brown rice has 3.5 grams per serving. For the same reason brown rice takes much, much longer to cook breaking down the cellulose to make it palatable, brown rice takes much, much longer to have it&#x27;s energy absorbed into the blood stream, the fiber.<p>When a person eats low glycemic therefore high fiber foods, they are getting the same amount of satiation per same quantity of food, but that fiber is passing through without being absorbed. So, people eating low glycemic foods are consuming less calories for the same level of satiation. That is the 10,000 ft view but it more complicated than that because different foods have different levels of satiation based on many things that are more than just physiological but also psychological.<p>The article says that high blood sugar levels lead to weight gain which isn&#x27;t entirely true in most people.

Not eating anything for a week is not only a bad strategy to lose weight it is actually a good strategy to gain weight afterwards. In my own experience whenever I tried to lose weight by eating less I lost a lot of weight but gained more than what I lost afterwards. You cannot stay hungry forever and if you lose more than 2 lbs per week your body goes into starvation mode, burning any stored energy rapidly, and rapidly storing anything you eat afterwards as fat just in case you don&#x27;t get food again. Body is more intelligent than we think.\n2. Once a fat cell is born it craves fat and that makes you hungry. Rapidly losing weight by staying hungry will only remove fat from fat cells but won&#x27;t kill them. Weight loss must be sustained for longer time to have any permanent effect.\n3. I have replaced white rice with brown rice, white bread with whole grain wheat bread and started eating sprouts and corn, oranges, guava etc. other fruits. Sprouts are killer deal man - you eat 200g of it you will hardly feel hungry for hours.\n4. You need to do some physical exercise everyday - not intense, just walking is okay.

It is talking about the case of a program that includes its dependencies in its own source code tree. I think docker-ized programs would still link against e.g. the system libssl rather than ship a copy of an ssl library with a program&#x27;s source. Another term sometimes used is &quot;vendoring&quot;.<p>A lot of Java programs ship jar files in their source tarballs, it has traditionally been a lot of work for Debian devs to pick these apart. Similarly, many &quot;things&quot; (programs or web services) that use javascript libraries often ship minified versions of common stuff like jquery rather than use the system version. It&#x27;s quite a mess. I think a lot of it stems from the fact that traditionally these sorts of libraries (jars, javascript) have not been well packaged or even packaged at all. The program authors are making life easier for the majority by shipping all the deps together. It&#x27;s not good for distros, but I can see the advantage.<p>I think subversion has a nice work around for this - they include a script to download the dependencies if you need them, otherwise the default is to link vs system deps.",1445438081

I hope it&#x27;s theraputic for her to get these out, and if she can turn the intimidation into some financial gains then so be it. Is there a way to discourage the behavior? It&#x27;s a tough problem.<p>As an anecdote, I just had a discussion with a female community college professor, PhD, one who had plenty of bench science experience before teaching. We are both born and raised in the US. Without naming specifics here, we both agreed that while US culture has made attempts - and is making attempts - to grow past gender subujation, there are numerous other cultures which aren&#x27;t even trying.<p>We noticed the cultural issues regarding women can be very obvious in a US educational environment. As in, for a woman to be in a position of authority, certain cultures behave in ways which do not acknowledge the earned, official status. I believe the phenomenon is real, and is a day-to-day reflection of what the violinist was exposed to in private. Also, it&#x27;s one thing in person - but the internet allows for all sorts of &#x27;border crossing&#x27; and people from all over the world are capable of reaching out and harassing someone, male, female, or otherwise.<p>In summation, I think US culture is attentive to a lot of &#x27;weak points&#x27; that need to be addressed (gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, handicaps), as difficult as they are for a diverse society...while some others are, well, really lacking in this arena. Like I said, I&#x27;m not going to name any one particular one or five, because it&#x27;s not my place - it&#x27;s up to the members of those cultures to enact their own change.",1445437128

Processed white rice has .6 grams of dietary fiber while unprocessed brown rice has 3.5 grams of dietary fiber per serving. Often the glycemic index is a function of fiber because the fiber slows down absorption of sugar so it happens slower over a longer period of time; white rice has a glycemic index of 50 and brown rice has lower index of 38.<p>High fiber foods are more satiating per calorie because of the fiber. It&#x27;s possible that low glycemic foods which are unprocessed lead to weight loss because of they are higher in fiber which just passes through the digestive system but feel just a filling. But I still disagree with the article that blood sugar spikes lead to weight gain in most normal people because the liver can absorb the sugar and release it later without converting it to fat.",1445436538

2185447,comment,2185259,2185259,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This seems like a poorly-expressed question. The premise is that one set or another of tools are used only for OOP.<p>UML is a modeling language for talking about abstract constructs. That means it's as good for working with FP as OOP. What you model in UML and how much you do and how you do it? That's an entirely different thing.<p>You have to have data. In FP, more than anywhere else, data is king. So I use UML to initially model data structures, just like I would no matter what paradigm I was working with. Let Codd be your copilot.<p>It's never right. There are those who model code ad infinitum and try to code the world completely top-down. This never works. There are those who don't model anything and try to code completely bottom-up. This works, but can become unmaintainable if not implemented correctly. The trick is to do a little top-down, a little bottom-up, a little top-down, etc. Usually within a couple cycles of this your basic program/data structure is nailed and you can move to being bottom-up and refactoring. I've probably described it more complicated than it actually is. But it works the same in OOP as FP (although I've noticed a quicker tendency to move towards bottom-up in FP and a tendency to stay top-down in OOP)<p>If the questioner is talking about software development methodologies, like Agile or RUP or CMM or waterfall, then it's also the same. After years of beating ourselves up in various ways, we've pretty much all agreed that short timeboxes, with concrete deliverables, public demonstrations, and constant adaptation to changing conditions beats everything else. However else you want to do it is up to you, but it should conform to those basics. FP or OOP really has nothing to do with it.<p>I think maybe the questioner is making the assumption that all this _stuff_, UML sequence diagrams and use cases and tiered architectures and whatnot -- that it's really how you program in OOP. But it's not. It never was. All that crap is just various tools that are useful in various situations to communicate about complex problems. They're not actually how you _do_ anything.",1296992728

I don't recall if these two things are specifically related.  Temple Grandin thinks in pictures and wrote a book with basically that title (""Thinking in Pictures"").  My son has to translate spoken words he hears into pictures to understand them and then translate pictures in his head into spoken words.  This need for translation means he sometimes has the kinds of misunderstandings with people that you typically see from someone who speaks English as a second language.  (And, in fact, he was a late talker -- and was basically pushed into it by mom enrolling him in preschool.)<p>These days, there is a fair amount of literature on things like lack of time sense and thinking in pictures.

People can not only use the final product of my work but I can also help them write their own products. I'm not sure if you thought about it, but your position on ""doing it for the good of humanity"" is inconsistent. You want brownie points but chose an arbitrary cut off point.<p>Other people can help me. I started as a solo developer on SumatraPDF and I've gotten significant contributions from others. The software is much better for it and has features that I know I wouldn't implement.<p>As to the downside you mentioned.<p>For me, the ability of other people to use my code in their own work is a feature, not a bug, so that boils to the difference of opinion.<p>I haven't noticed the effect of ""diminishing attribution"". If anything, the attribution I get increases. First, pretty much every open-source license requires attribution. Second, my software has been improved by other people but since I'm the original developer and host the website for it, I benefit from that (not because I try to hide the fact (quite the contrary) but because most people won't look at svn checkins to see who did what work and will naturally associate most of the credit with the guy who's the face of the project).",1296992109

You pointed out the relevant documents to dig deeper, and several people I talked to found you struck the perfect balance there.<p>Now, I disagree with them there: I was after a more technical talk - a token implementation of semantic hashing and discussion of issues run into while making/scaling it would have made this talk amazing for me. But that's a personal preference thing, I was aware of the techniques mentioned before entering so I was not really your target audience.<p>Beyond that, everyone I talked to was unimpressed by your begging for coverage as per the ""tweet this"" slides and matching vocal appeals for such. This isn't a blog article where you make the appeal clear and loud to get more followers; this was a presentation at an industry conference, and that behavior was particularly out of place and ill-received.<p>In addition, you are the only conference speaker I saw appealing to attendees to rate their talk (at least twice on the #strataconf tag) so i would take the ratings with a grain of salt.<p>I know the above seems very negative, so I should repeat: it was a fairly good talk, and would have been great (even though less technical than I was hoping from the 'practitioner' track) except for the primadonna attitude surrounding it. I have enjoyed many of your postings on HN, I've found substantial value in metaoptimize/qa, and I really wanted to love your talk - so perhaps i'm being unduly harsh.

I had the domain, had a plan, just had to execute. I'd barely gotten started when I ran into a wall, instead of working I would just stare blankly at my computer. I had zero motivation to do any actual work.<p>And yet, I was still passionate and believed in the idea, which led me to a similar place as you where I'm wondering ""what gives?""<p>This situation showed me that I had an internal problem, that while I could function in environments with external motivational factors, if I removed them, I had nothing. Something inside was holding me back.<p>It was only through a combination of months of therapy and soul searching that I was able to find the source of my motivational short-circuit, I had given up on the first thing I ever truly wanted without even trying to achieve it. After that epiphany, motivation has been the least of my concerns. Heck, I'm working on my plans for world domination at this very moment.<p>So here's my advice, take the time to debug your brain, it won't be easy, but it beats having that error message pop up for the rest of your life.",1296991477

Now I can see where you're coming from.<p>> Not at all, you're one instance of a class of plague that furthers the disinterest and apathy of talented people in startups and entrepreneurialism. They will peruse HN or similar communities for a time, run into non-content such as you post, and run screaming. Your existence and those of your ilk serve to harm the startup industry and give the corporations more leverage to hold onto the truly good hackers.<p>So, you're commenting is because you think my blog is harming the startup industry and giving corporations more leverage against hackers.<p>I don't think that's the case - I'm all for for self-employment and people doing their own thing. I pretty regularly encourage people to do just that, and offer to lend a hand to anyone who has questions or I can help, and I've done a fairly large amount of free work for people here to lend a hand.<p>Personally, I've contracted or ran my own company in 3-4 different fields, had employees, negotiated contracts, done large-ish deals, and lived/worked/traveled through 40+ countries.<p>I share those experiences. Also, I share what I'm learning on tracking time, building habits, I review books, write lots on history...<p>But you know what, I'm open to a dialog here. You've got a serious aversion to me, and I feel like it's really uncalled-for. I haven't done wrong by you, and I work to make myself valuable, serve people, and do my writing to the best of my ability.<p>But, what would you look for more of? What's missing? For instance, in this post here that you don't seem to like - I'm looking for the link that makes someone good at getting money in a self-employed/business context. I explored a few things, and I think one of the biggest is having no hangups - being willing to shovel snow even after being a multi-platinum selling artist. Or starting a valet parking company even though you know nothing about it.<p>I think there's some interesting stuff in this post. Apparently others agree, because it's at #1 here. But you disagree. What would you prefer differently? Share your take and I'll listen - maybe I can learn here and improve.",1296990749

I'm just not sure if you're aware of that kind of license, since it didn't sound like it and those licenses get less attention than the more radical GPL.)",1296990227

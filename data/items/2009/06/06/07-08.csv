644610,comment,644007,644007,0,0,kunqiana,,,"From my point of view the video is basically saying collaboration is most important as a programmer. Unlike athletes, programmers have to work together to achieve something great. Anything that is really impressive/great will come from the contribution of many programmers (eg linux). The question is: what is the most effective way to collaborate? Is there something about the ego that makes us ineffective? It would be really interesting if they had elaborated more on what makes a ""healthy ego"". Personally, as one of the critics has said, ""people have egos no matter how humble they appear to be."" It is simply human nature. Perhaps sometime it is more important to not to dumb down our own egos (or other people's) but to be more empathetic and reasonable working together.",1244274878

Yes, a place like Youngstown, Ohio probably needs to find a way to survive without the GM plant.

This country's had ghost towns appear when markets collapse and industries disappear before, it could stand to see that happen again. I happen to live in a college town where the second biggest employer (i.e. not the college) is hiring electronics assemblers every week, because it's in a growing market.

644592,comment,643207,643845,0,0,yason,,,"I'd like to know, too. I haven't bought a new game since 1995 or 1996. I've seen some games at my friends' and I tried out some technological milestones such as Quake 3 when it was released on Linux but didn't really catch up on playing anymore. The only thing I've been repeatedly played is Doom -- I use it for processing ideas in the subconscious while keeping my conscious thinking in the gameplay.<p>I thought that perhaps it's the difference between a 15-year-old and a 30-year-old but then I decided to try out some old games I used to play in the early 90's. I set up F1GP, EOB, EOB2, Syndicate, Monkey Island, Super Frog, Civilization, UFO, etc. and I was hooked! They were just fantastic and FUN! Some even more so than back in the early 90's! I would definitely buy games like those if I knew which of the new ones were good.<p>Of course, not having Windows is a huge restriction with regard to gaming but a one that has suited me fine all these years. If there turns out to be a killer game somewhere I might just set up a virtual machine for XP and try it out.",1244273422

Microsoft only has to show it can compete, and it has won.  They get to keep: the significant portion of the populace that's only dimly aware that they can switch search engines and also the portion that doesn't care.  Certain types of results have a slicker presentation -- right there, many of the habitual users of those subsets are going to go to Bing, and these <i>habitual searchers</i> are probably many of the people most valuable to advertisers.<p>Remember, to win against the Germans at Stalingrad, the Russians first had to fight them to a standstill and keep them grinding their gears there for awhile.  Sometimes the key to victory is to sap your opponent's momentum by just holding them at bay.

644584,comment,643891,644478,0,0,netsp,,,"Apple on the other hand, often seems to actively prefer to compete at a disadvantage. It's hard to get an Apple for work, it usually employees voicing (loudly) a preference. They rarely use price to break into or maintain markets. They want people to overcome those barriers to get the product. So if someone buys an Apple or an iphone it's because they really wanted it. When they win, it's usually because they made something someone really wanted. Wanted enough to pay for it themselves; nag their boss; learn something new or some other obstacle. It would be a break from this strategy if iphones started to be mass issued by employers putting them in to the hands of people who are apathetic.<p>MSFT take the opposite approach. Their usually involve the path of least resistance. That often using high high/dominant market share; pricing strategies; barriers to switching; barriers to being the odd one out, etc.<p>Both are IMO good business strategies & both are good businesses. But there is a qualitative difference in the approach. If <i>sheer commitment to high level of craftsmanship is the primary way</i> to winning, they probably won't win.",1244271690

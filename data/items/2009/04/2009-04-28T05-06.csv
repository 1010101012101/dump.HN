They don't need the Tufte aesthetic or sparklines, all they should be is not cartoony, information-lite, or <i>ugly</i> apps.<p>I'm interested in recommendations for tight, good design in recent iPhone apps.

582755,comment,582691,582733,0,0,dasil003,,,"It really depends on the school.  In my high school there was no dominant clique, so the situation was somewhat as the author described.  Sure people made fun of nerds, mostly because they left themselves open to it by being different and socially awkward, but there was definitely no strict hierarchy amongst cliques.  I think there is some truth to the idea that certain nerds create a sense of superiority as a defense mechanism (think Comic Book Guy), but that is not the root cause of the nerd's social status.<p>After the opening section I think the rant goes completely off the deep end with a rapid succession of wrong-headed generalizations.  It reads like an 18-year-old who just finished high school and now thinks he's got it all figured out.  The idea that programmers define themselves by what they are not, or by nitpicking inconsequential details is laughable.  Sure programmers may be a bit more prone to nasty protracted flamewars over subtle issues, but we don't define ourselves that way.  Sure our communities form around tools moreso than ideas (though not exclusively), but that's simply a matter of necessity given the detail of using any particular tool well.  Personally I find the notion that ""I define myself as a programmer"" offensive.  Programming is something I do, and I do it reasonably well, but at the end of the day it's only one of many things I do, and it's certainly not ""who I am.""",1240897488

582747,comment,582350,582561,0,0,wheels,,,"There are certainly differences, as you point out.  It'd be amazing if you averaged up all male specimens and all female specimens on the planet and the averages lined up on anything.<p>The question isn't so much if there are differences, but if they reasonably correspond to the gender gap in programming.  There are obviously social factors at work since fields like being a high school math teacher, which usually requires a degree in mathematics, is dominated by women, but being a computer programmer, which requires less mathematics, is not.<p>If the gap was, say, you know, 10% I might say, ""Yeah, there you go.  Gender differences.""  But given that a lot of software shops are upwards of 95% male, I don't think you can claim that the remaining 5% of women that crossed the bar were the only ones smart enough to write PHP.<p>And see, that's the thing.  If all of the great programmers were men and the bad programmers were about 50/50, that'd support the gender gap thesis more.  I mean, certainly most women that are in the top 10% of their class could be trained to be poor PHP programmers.  It's not rocket surgery.  But they're not there and there is a dearth of bad male PHP programmers (who may be otherwise intelligent).  So it seems to be a little more complicated than ""innate ability"".",1240896695
582746,comment,582203,582287,0,0,10ren,,,"The actual discussion will also improve recall, because you are recalling the information in many ways, and exercising your mental model of it. The process of discussion gives you practice in recalling and using the information.<p>You may also learn something from the discussion itself, become aware of gaps, fill those gaps, get addition points of view and ways to think about it, reasons for holding opinions, which ones seem right but are wrong and why (and which ones seemed stupid at first but - dramatically - aren't). The social aspect, and the competitive aspect, will help you engage. Later, you might even recall some aspects episodically, e.g. ""Jones said this, and Bloggs undercut him, and then <i>I</i> showed they were both wrong, and everyone laughed"". Memorable.<p>I agree that anticipation of a discussion will also make your preparation for it more effective.",1240896621

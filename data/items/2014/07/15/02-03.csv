The did it in this case because they already knew that he was almost certainly not a terrorist.<p>First, an actual terrorist would probably have left as soon as the guards came out, rather than argue with them over whether or not photography from public property is allowed. Staying and arguing gives the guards more time to note identifying details that could lead their plans being disrupted.<p>Second, since they tracked him down from his rental car, and since they FBI does in fact have basic competence, they knew by then that he was a professional photographer and everything about the incident was consistent with his expected behavior based on his profession and his publication history.<p>So why not drop it at that point?

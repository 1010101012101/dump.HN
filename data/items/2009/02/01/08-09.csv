My employees will have a desk VoIP phone connected to the company PBX, email, IM, and all the other stuff that is used for internal communication in companies where a bunch of folks are sat in offices and cubes but hardly ever bother to walk over to each other's positions as it is not really part of the workflow protocol.  And these are employees, not subcontractors.  I will manage them. I just won't be standing over their shoulder.<p>I don't see why that's such an impossibly lofty goal.",1233478798

It's actually a pretty fundamental problem.<p>Of course, like most things wrong with javascript, you can fix it if you work for it. Objective-J fixes all the things we had problems with, and this is one of them. A lot of things in Cappuccino would not be possible without the hashing feature Tom mentioned.<p>As a hash table, JavaScript objects are pretty awful. You can't get a count of objects unless you literally count all the keys. And you can't iterate over the keys if anyone else has added anything to the Object prototype.<p>Cappuccino has a proper hash table, CPDictionary, which solves both of those problems. There's a lot of other data structures that address some of the author's listed concerns.",1233478665

I outproduced others, even while taking the hardest problems -- and we had a pretty good metrics systems, so I wasn't just gaming it.<p>But when I asked if I could work from home when I'd decided to move, the answer was an emphatic, ""No.""<p>So, they'd rather lose their most-productive employee who also would've been far more productive at home and then have to hire a probably-inferior replacement?<p>Makes no sense at all, yet so many companies are like this.",1233478643

So much that they chastise each other for bankruptcy on Internet forums. (oh no! someone on the internet is fiscally irresponsible!) And act as if not fulfilling monetary obligations to big, anonymous corporations is tantamount to proving that one is a worthless human being.<p>2. And yet, at the same time, the same corporations that these very-responsible-debt-paying people owe fealty to, will perpetrate enormous fraud -- of the technical definition and just general ""looks like a fraud, smells like a fraud, who cares what the law says"" kind. This fraud can fuck not only other such corporations, but the entire financial system, and the country's stability as a whole.<p>Got it?<p>Debt payors are considered horrible people if they do not repay all their private debts. Debt payees, on the other hand, have carte blanche to act however they want and get excused by saying ""That's the way free market capitalism works.""<p>Thus you have individuals lambasting other individuals, and going ""OH NO, you cannot just say that DEBT is NOT a MORAL OBLIGATION!"" with regards to individuals who owe, but just shaking their heads and clucking their tongues with regards to the acts of corporations.<p>This is basically a case of the serfs policing themselves, while the nobles are pleased to promote any kind of ignoble acts among themselves.",1233476821

460693,story,,,33,50,abalashov,"Ask HN: Is a team of work-at-home employees realistic?",,"Hi everyone,<p>I was wondering what you think about the feasibility of building a team consisting of employees who work at home. I don't mean a completely remote team;  I am talking about local people, and certainly with some measure of face-to-face meetings and physical interaction when that level of collaboration is required.  I just mean people who work mostly at home on a day-to-day basis.<p>As far as I can tell, corporate America is mostly terrified of telecommuting.  Admittedly, it can be legitimately said to pose some very real management challenges.  But no matter how much I consider that, I just can't see a justification for paying for office space and forcing people to spend time there for 8+ hours a day.  I think I agree very strongly with what PG has had to say on the topic of corporate office space and its relationship to talented individuals and their productivity.<p>I agree that it's harder to manage remote people, and I've certainly taken stock of the allegedly widespread tendency for remote workers to take advantage of their independence and lack of direct oversight.  And lack of consistent and direct communication can certainly be an obstacle.  But I think there are technological solutions to these problems:  better backoffice tools, better collaboration and messaging tools, VoIP, instant messaging, presence, good ticketing and workflow management systems, etc.  I think the technology is there to make up for the shortfall.<p>Now, admittedly, the angle from which I am approaching this problem is a little bit orthogonal to the typical dilemmas of web startup entrepreneurs.  I am 23, and at the moment, I am trying to grow my VoIP / telecom systems integration and engineering consultancy beyond a one-man show so that I can get to the point where I can be a product company.  In other words, I suppose it's fair to say I am taking the ""consulting route"" that PG speaks of in his various essays on startup funding.  Good, bad, I have various reasons for that, but the goal in the end is to end up with actual ""deliverables"" - no mistake about it.<p>Still, the reason I mention that is because consulting is a business model that lends itself to measurement of individual productivity a bit better than, say, a software startup.  Product development and engineering - pure CAPEX, none of which is directly rebilled or amortised any way (especially in a short time to market) - is a little more murky.  And certainly, there are some business models where almost the entire risk can be shifted onto the employee, as one sees with commission-only work-at-home salespeople.  In my case I think I'm in a happy middle.<p>Regardless, I'm not going to go all Japanese quantitative management on people.  I want to build a progressive and humanity-affirming company where people are happy and proud to work on interesting problems in the telecommunications space.  I am just wondering if I am being too idealistic here about remote work;  are people just going to take advantage of me, in the main?  Or is it reasonable to suppose that I should be able to afford them the benefit of working wherever they want as long as they meet certain criteria as far as productivity, availability, and good communication? (All my prospective employees are excellent written and verbal communicators, and I would not have it any other way.)<p>I am in Atlanta, a city notorious for its vast, empty suburban sprawl, unconscienable freeway distances, and gridlock traffic.  I really, really don't want to compel anyone to trek through this disaster of urban planning and infrastructure design to my office if there is no real point.<p>Does anyone here have experience building a team like this?  If so, can you share tips on what strategies you used to make it work better?<p>Thanks a lot!",1233476164

If transparency is counterproductive to achieving that goal than we should abandon it.<p>As far as ""handling the truth"" I don’t think that speaks to his point.  When we use that phrase we are talking about someone controlling their reaction to a change they can perceive.  Such as someone preventing themselves from emotionally falling apart when something bad happens.<p>But group think, and the desire for acceptance which is its root cause, is something people don’t perceive is happening to them.  They therefore can’t consciously control their reaction to it.<p>His suggestion is that we remove the root stimuli so as to not provoke the reaction to begin with.  So your point doesn’t really apply.",1233475599

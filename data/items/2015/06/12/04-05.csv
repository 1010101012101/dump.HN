9704130,comment,9703156,9703156,0,0,shaftway,,,"I interviewed and was hired almost 5 years ago.  My experience was largely positive, though the process took a long time.<p>I had 5 interviewers.  I made it clear to each up front that I had never worked in one of the canonical languages (Java, Python, C++, Go) and that my background was mostly C#.  All of my interviewers seemed to take that point, so the questions I was asked were mostly pseudo-code.  The one language-specific thing was about Java iterators, so I had to ask about the Iterable/Iterator contract before I could start.  My pseudo code was pretty C#ish and that&#x27;s pretty close to Java, so I was able to intelligently discuss differences or explain my intent.<p>The crazy thing about my interview (and the interviews of most people that I talked to) was that I thought that I crashed really hard.  One guy let me fumble around for almost the entire time trying to answer his questions (it dealt with statistics and big data).  Of the five, I feel like I knocked it out of the park with two of them, flubbed it with two of them, and the fifth was meh.<p>Later, I talked to the recruiter about it.  I was feeling a lot of impostor syndrome (very common) and trying to understand why I was hired and make sure that it wasn&#x27;t an accident.  In the end, recruiters are looking for very high or very low scores from your interviewer, and interviewers give a lot of points for trying.  Even the ones that I thought I failed on gave me medium scores because I did a good job of connecting with them on a personal level, and I talked through my work as I did it.  So I ended up with 3 moderate scores and two high ones, which was enough.<p>As for passing but not getting hired, that&#x27;s a little different.  You don&#x27;t really pass the interview.  You do a phone screen and then the recruiter decides whether to proceed.  After that you come in for interviews, and once you&#x27;re scored again the recruiter decides whether to proceed.  Then you go to hiring committee, where they decide hire or no hire.  The recruiters have a pretty good idea of what hiring committee will say, and they tend to send borderline people.  After hiring committee you go to offer committee and then you get the offer letter.  After you accept the offer, if you&#x27;re a general purpose SWE, then you talk to teams to determine placement.  The whole process took about 3 months for me.<p>For my prep, I actually went on other interviews and read books (particularly on solving by induction - these things show up often on interviews).<p>Everybody has a different experience, but when I read posts by people who claim they were passed over because they couldn&#x27;t solve a specific problem, I suspect the problem was really poor culture fit, resulting in low scores across all of the interviewers.",1434084883

A caregiver&#x27;s failure or omission to provide a child with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the child&#x27;s physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the child; or<p>2. A caregiver&#x27;s failure to make a reasonable effort to protect a child from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person.<p>Neglect of a child may be based on repeated conduct or on a single incident or omission that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, serious physical or mental injury, or a substantial risk of death, to a child.<p>If I&#x27;m reading it correctly, an incident like this could have been legal grounds to charge the parents with neglect if and only if it was repeated conduct - e.g., they had repeatedly locked the kid out of the house.

All it would (should) take is one person involved to have the nerve(as if it should take nerve) to speak up and say &quot;this is ridiculous&quot;.<p>In this case (assuming this story is true, but there&#x27;s no shortage of similar stories if this one isn&#x27;t), it took a <i>fucking child</i> to have the nerve to state the obvious:<p>*\nBut then, according to Cindy, &quot;My son spoke up.&quot; He said he wanted to talk to the judge. Surprised, their lawyer asked the boy: Did he have the courage to go through with this? And would he tell the truth? The boy said yes. &quot;He went back there and spoke to the judge for about ten minutes,&quot; said Cindy. &quot;And then the judge came out and called the two lawyers to the bench and talked to them for about 10 or 15 minutes. And with that, our lawyer came to us and said that if we admitted that we didn&#x27;t know that it was wrong to [let our son] stay in the backyard, but that we know now that it&#x27;s wrong and we will never let it happen again, and that we will explain this to our son, he would let the children come with us.&quot;<p>Cindy and Fred promised. The judge released the kids and closed the case.\n*<p>I wonder, how does this happen, and why does it happen mostly in western countries?<p>My best theory is, unless you are a true revolutionary/disruptor, if you are just well-above-average skill, but not Elon Musk level, your easiest ride is just playing the system.  This case (ignoring that it shouldn&#x27;t have even happened in the first place) could have been closed immediately, if people in the justice system were interested in administering <i>justice</i>.  But they&#x27;re not - they are interested in <i>revenue</i>.  Stretching cases like this out for weeks / months increases (or at least maintains) federal funding requirements, but it also pulls external money into the system (defense fees) that goes to your brothers and sisters you attended law school with. Think of the $ this one case generated, and it&#x27;s just a kid hanging out in his back yard!<p>It&#x27;s not just the legal system that is like this, although it&#x27;s one of the worst offenders.  I see similar behavior working in IT (in medium to large companies)- things that are obviously easy to fix, problems that aren&#x27;t difficult to solve (or don&#x27;t even need solving at all) turn into multi-hundred-thousand, or even multi-million $ projects.  And if you say &quot;wait a minute, does this make sense what we&#x27;re doing&quot;, your head will shortly be cut off, because so many people have skin in the game.

Of course, there was risk involved with both parties, but it seemed to work fine for both a 5-person startup and 100-employee agency.<p>2. Phone call to talk generalities and big picture, followed by a lunch meeting that doubled as a conversational technical interview, followed by a take-home exercise on a paid-for-time-if-no-offer basis.<p>I went through this scenario once, and liked it even better. The idea behind paying me if no offer follows was that I could be (and was) given a real problem the company needs solved (small, fairly standalone feature in my case) that I could work out for them for a reasonable fee. They&#x27;d get full rights to the work, I wouldn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a waste of my time if nothing comes of it, and it would all be nil and void if I were offered a job in the end.<p>3. Quick 30-minute phone call with a few team members to get a sense for what the position, team, and I are all about, followed by a 5-hour marathon in-person interview, but broken up into more digestible chunks: 45-min chat with one of the leads, 45-min chat with someone more on par with the position, 45-min whiteboard problem, 45-min session of actually solving problems at a real computer (while being encouraged to do it the way I would, using Google, Stack Overflow, asking them things as I would ask coworkers, etc.), etc.<p>This last one was at a BigCo in the Valley and I felt was a pretty damn solid way to go about it.

But, of course, kids are astute observers and somewhere along the line, he figured it out.<p>I got out of the car one day to feed the parking meter next to the driver side window. “Don’t, Mommy. Don’t. The police will come.” I went to let the dog into our front yard while he was watching his morning cartoon. “Mommy, no!!! The police.”<p>One afternoon after his swim lesson, he came out of the bathroom and for a second didn’t see me — I’d kneeled down to get his shoes from their cubby. When I looked up he was crying. “Mommy, mommy, I thought someone was going to steal me.”<p>That evening I sat him down and tried to explain it. I told him that he was right, that mommy had left him in the car for a few minutes one time and that was a mistake. I wasn’t supposed to do that. But it was all going to be fine now. Mommy wasn’t going to jail. And no one was going to kidnap him!<p>“Most people,” I told him, “are not trying to hurt you. Most people are good people. Do you understand? You don’t have to be afraid?”<p>He nodded slowly, but I could see from his face that he only half believed me.&quot;",1434083807

Everything gets the most superficial consideration, there&#x27;s no basis of reasonableness such that even the judge doesn&#x27;t stop the machine, power is so distributed that there&#x27;s no reasonable authority in place, and people like CPS -- who have difficult and challenging and necessary jobs -- don&#x27;t know how to recognize &quot;normal&quot; when they see it. American has no &quot;normal&quot; anymore, and everyone acts based on their greatest fears, informed by our weird local news, NCIS/Law&Order fear-mongering mentality. We used to have class divisions that kept things a little normal within class lines, now class divisions have been destroyed such that everyone&#x27;s caught in a race to the bottom.<p>1b) I like to think I&#x27;m not really subject to #1, being an upper middle class white professional... but I live in a relatively urban environment, with a pre-teen child, and there&#x27;s a sense that one socially construed &quot;accident&quot; can send me into a can of worms that can take years to climb out of. So, until then, I&#x27;ll assume I&#x27;m relatively untouchable, because I&#x27;m not really sure what else my option is. I can see relocating, to one of my international anchor points.. permanently, at some point.<p>2) There&#x27;s a strong tinge of &quot;fuck them&quot; or &quot;they have no right&quot; or &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t&quot; in a lot of American interactions now, whether formal or otherwise. People are endlessly bothered by things they aren&#x27;t affected by. I mean, it&#x27;s not everywhere...<p>American culture is now a corporate construct designed to make everyone in its demographic purview feel strongly about something that doesn&#x27;t matter to them, whether it&#x27;s escapees with big dicks or the Kardashians. Radio plays the same 10 songs over and over and over again so you have to hit scan and your radio takes you through stations back to news anchor talking about news that doesn&#x27;t matter. And if you get home and turn on the TV you&#x27;re assaulted by the local news anchors with &quot;news you can trust&quot; or weather reports &quot;you can count on&quot;, and when you ignore that your co-worker at work will just force it down your throat anyway, and you&#x27;ll pretend to go along with it so as to have some minor smidgeon of false rapport, lest you come off as anti-social or.. critical.<p>I was just at a farmer&#x27;s market tonight where kids ran free and cops patted kids on the head and dogs were off leash and people were eating ice cream and yelling and laughing. But it just takes one person, with a spiteful &quot;I&#x27;ll get &#x27;em...&quot; trigger to bring an invisible avalanche into the room. I think it&#x27;s worse in urban areas and in suburban areas, which is why I&#x27;ve been living in medium sized &quot;towns&quot; with urban centers. There seems to be less of that in that kind of neighborly construct. But neither can we talk about places like urban California, suburban California, and rural California in equal terms that cover those places, but also midwestern areas or southern areas or bible belt areas. We&#x27;re not one country anymore, and we have no norms, and people are always told that someone, somewhere is taking shit from them, whether it&#x27;s terrorists, the emboldened, or the entitled.

So, with a few such examples, \nsome people who want to get attention\nget some laws passed and set up CPS\nwith some really big powers, e.g., ones\nthat violate little things like due process.\nSome of the laws mention felonies.<p>Then the CPS department gets created,\nfunded, and staffed.  Then a phone call\ncomes in, and CPS <i>swings into action</i>.<p>Then, CPS wants to look busy, <i>do their\njob</i>, believes that they are now responsible\nfor the child, wants to make sure nothing\ngoes wrong where they could be blamed, so\ntake full control of the life of the child,\nas their rules say, and to heck with\nanything like due process, the actual\ngood of the child, the good of the\nfamily, etc.  Instead, CPS becomes just\nlaw and rules driven.<p>So, CPS is brain-dead, dysfunctional,\ndangerous, destructive, demented,\nderanged, etc.  Why?  They are just\nfollowing the law and their rules\nto avoid any blame.<p>So, CPS put a torpedo just below the\nwaterline of that totally innocent\nfamily.  They did psychological\ndamage to the child; they harmed\nthe sense of security of the family;\nthey wasted the time of the family;\nthe may have wrecked the family\nfinances due to the legal costs.<p>Earlier tonight I watched the <i>Nova</i>\nprogram on the June 6, 1944 Normandy\nlanding.  I was reminded of all the\ndeath and destruction fighting Hitler.<p>But then with something like CPS\nand US police shooting unarmed Blacks\nin the back, etc., we are creating\ndisasters out of nothing, nothing\nat all, disasters, out of nothing,\nfor no good reason.<p>The judge?  He should have\nfound a way to charge the CPS\nthugs, laughed their case out of\ncourt, and put the family back \ntogether.  Since he didn&#x27;t, he\nshould get a new career\ncleaning sidewalks with a tooth brush --\n&quot;Nice and clean, now, y&#x27;hear?&quot;.<p>CPS must report to a mayor or\ngovernor, etc.  Well, with\nenough such stories, the mayor\nor whomever should ensure that the\nhead\nof CPS and everyone involved\nin that case should join\nthe judge in brushing the\nsidewalks.<p>Part of the solution is <i>sunlight</i>,\ne.g., on the Internet.<p>Too often our government has become\njust a dangerous enemy of the citizens.\nThe citizens should vote \nfor the needed changes.  Due to CPS,\nevery family with children is\nat risk of essentially just\nthugs from CPS wrecking their\nfamilies, a greater risk than a\nbomb from a terrorist and\ncomparably dangerous.<p>TSA?  Sure, they can steal money\nand valuables from your luggage and\nmolest your wife and daughters.<p>Gee, when I was 10 or so, I got\na three speed bicycle, and then,\nespecially during the summers,\nI was <i>gone</i> for hours at a time,\nsometimes 20 miles round trip.\nNo problems.<p>I was big for\nmy age:  If some CPS types\nhad tried to do something\nto me, it would have been\na fight, a real fight --\nI would have defended myself\nfrom the CPS attackers.\nSure, if I could have found\na club, I would have\nbeat them to a bloody pulp --\njust ordinary self-defense.<p>Government wants to grow, like\npoison ivy or worse.  Have to\ncut it back.  The key way:\nJust cut their budgets.  How to\ndo that?  Sure, vote.  Then\nget rid of the government\nthugs who attack citizens and\nget lower taxes.<p>Read.  Complain.

9704021,comment,9703500,9703804,0,0,pash,,,"It&#x27;s somewhat debatable whether the refactor is an improvement, but there is at least one good argument that it is, and (in my opinion) only a much poorer argument that it makes things less clear.<p>If the applicative code is better, it&#x27;s because applicatives are strictly less powerful than monads, in the sense that everything you can do with applicatives you can also do with monads, but not vice-versa.<p>Many Haskellers prefer the abstraction that is &quot;just powerful enough&quot;, or what&#x27;s the same thing, they prefer the abstraction that is &quot;least powerful&quot;—that is, Haskellers try to write code in a way that lets them do what they want want to do, but at the same time in a way that doesn&#x27;t allow them do things they didn&#x27;t mean to do. And for just that reason: using the least powerful abstraction prevents you from introducing bugs by keeping you from writing some of the things that you didn&#x27;t intend to write.<p>Thus the least powerful abstraction is the best abstraction, in the sense that it&#x27;s the &quot;best fit&quot; (and, yes, also in an aesthetic sense). So if you can write what you want using applicatives rather than monads, you should prefer applicatives, the argument goes. (And if you can write it with functors, prefer functors to applicatives.) For the same reason, many Haskellers prefer to use restrictions of the IO type that limit what you can do rather than IO itself, whenever it&#x27;s convenient.<p>Applicative style, in this case, also keeps you from having to name a couple of things, which means two fewer &quot;hard things&quot; (in Dijkstra&#x27;s estimation) for the programmer to deal with—and just two fewer things, which means two fewer things to screw up, period.<p>The counter-argument, that applicatives are somehow more complicated or less clear than monads, is a poor one, I think. Haskell is not a superficial language. It&#x27;s not one you&#x27;re meant to be able to read and understand just because you&#x27;re a competent programmer in some other, unrelated language. If you want to program in Haskell, you need to understand the languange&#x27;s core abstractions—and, yes, applicative style is one of them at this point. That does mean there&#x27;s more to learn. But Haskell is all about giving programmers the ability to recognize and use the right abstraction; the time spent learning is worth your while.<p>Further, if you&#x27;re not a Haskell programmer, I think you should beware of pretending that you understand the monadic &quot;before&quot; code and therefore thinking that it&#x27;s simpler than the applicative &quot;after&quot; code that you don&#x27;t pretend to understand. First, because (syntactic subterfuge notwithstanding) you don&#x27;t really understand the monadic code, unless you&#x27;ve learned the underlying concepts; and second, because it&#x27;s not simpler. It&#x27;s just not. There is more going on in the monadic code, not less. Now, if you&#x27;re a beginner and you understand monads but not applicatives, you have an argument—the monadic code is familiar, and the applicative code isn&#x27;t—but that just means you have more to learn. Go learn it. We&#x27;re here to help.",1434082562

If this was straight C, &quot;update&quot; would be a method that gets called 30 times per second, and &quot;main&quot; would get called when the game starts, and everything else would map pretty much line-for-line.<p>Similarly, the &quot;functional-reactive&quot; nature of it feel like an implementation detail, rather than a different way of thinking about the code—in your update method you still walk through the steps &quot;was <- or -> pressed?  was ^ pressed?  Move the ship.  Fire your gun.  Change your velocity.&quot;  Maybe some of them don&#x27;t need to be recalculated?  Okay, but as the programmer you still need to describe the same steps, even if some of them get optimized away.<p>And honestly, even going through the same steps, it makes it harder to understand.  Take your update function:<p><pre><code>    updateVelocity newVel (updateShooting isShooting (applyPhysics dt ship))\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so you have an applyPhysics method that takes a ship, and a dt.  That&#x27;s pretty clear.  And it returns... something, and that something gets passed into updateShooting, and then what updateShooting returns gets passed into updateVelocity.  You have to go elsewhere to read that, okay, applyPhysics and updateShooting both return ships.  The same steps, written in a more imperative syntax:<p><pre><code>    applyPhysics(ship, dt);\n    updateShooting(ship, isShooting);\n    updateVelocity(ship, newVel);\n</code></pre>\nWhich (a) makes it more clear that a ship gets passed into each method, but (b) also lets you pass in the more important parameter first, which aids readability, and (c) lets you list the methods in the order that they occur, rather than writing them in the <i>reverse</i> of the order they occur.  To at least get the better argument order with Elm you&#x27;d have to write it:<p><pre><code>    updateVelocity (updateShooting (applyPhysics ship dt) isShooting) newVel\n</code></pre>\nWhich is completely unreadable—you&#x27;re reduced to counting parentheses to see which method &quot;isShooting&quot; gets passed into.",1434082440

In some ways, Microsoft is even better off than a lot of Android OEMs at this point. Android OEMs get to make their meager profits when the device is sold, and Google makes all the other money off the device owner for the rest of the device&#x27;s lifetime -- they get the Google Play revenues for apps, they get the search ad revenues, they get to offer you other Google services on the device. Microsoft could conceivably be in the same boat -- they have the Windows app store, Bing and Office and such, so they can monetize Windows phones throughout the whole lifetime of the device.

So, you can mock your concurrent requests using the Identity or ZipList applicative, and use the type class laws to prove things which are true about both. I&#x27;m guessing, but it looks like the spawn syntax is built-in here. Not that it&#x27;s not as elegant as the Concurrent version, but likely not as powerful from an abstraction point of view.",1434081687

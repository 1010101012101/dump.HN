Yes. But the fact is that insights are easy, change is hard. And if you're not using FreeMind or something similar to take notes and construct new ideas then you might as well be eating paintchips.

1744387,comment,1742804,1743682,0,0,anatoly,,,"The boring answer is that there is no particular nerd-rage directed against IDEs. There are many nerds who prefer IDEs and there are many nerds who prefer text editors. The modern culture encourages us to self-identify as rebels breaking away from uniformity. Thus your attention focuses on people putting down IDEs, while a vim user's attention focuses on people putting down text editors.<p>I don't use IDEs, because I find myself somewhat less productive in them. Syntax coloring, to me, is a fantastic feature, and I use it in a text editor. Integration with source control and usage searches are things I like to do in a separate window, because I want them to be deliberate enough - I think they'd break my concentration more easily if I didn't have to context-switch to do them. I dislike autocomplete for a similar reason - it creates the impression of my thought moving in tiny jerks all the time - even if it isn't really true, the impression itself is a nuisance. I don't think that the typing speed gains from autocomplete could really matter to me. The time spent actually typing lines of source code is a very small portion of my most productive days.<p>All of these things are not true for some programmers I know who feel at home in IDEs, some of them my betters.",1285872986

A professional actually cares <i>more</i> about usability and certainly cares about aesthetics as they apply to usability.  The way a professional perceives a desktop will be very different from the way a casual user does.  But some people are self-conscious about that; they don't want their professional exposure to change the way they perceive things, or at least they don't want anybody else to notice.  So they want a plastic consumer case for their Hole Hawg[1].<p>Not that OS X doesn't have a lot going for it on the desktop, but a major part of the appeal for developers is that they can have a great desktop they love without non-geeks thinking they must be a little weird to love it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.team.net/mjb/hawg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.team.net/mjb/hawg.html</a>",1285872865

So mentioning one app that happened to sneak by the approval process for a short amount of time is meaningless for drawing any real conclusions.<p>In general, having all the permissions of an app determined at install time seems very flawed to me (whether or not those permissions are optional). Why not ask for permission, when necessary, during the app use, so the user knows exactly what is requiring those permissions? That model is used by desktop apps, and it is the way I would implement it. The up-front permissions model is like sites that ask for your email first before they allow you to read their content- generally scams.",1285872644

What will I want my audience to know about this book? What do I agree with or disagree with? What are the highlights? I sometimes take notes while I'm reading, but more often I just try to maintain that mindset.<p>When I'm done I write a quick 3 to 7 paragraph review and post it on GoodReads. Knowing that my review will be public forces me to take an objective look at my thoughts on the book, are they intelligible, consistent, relevant?<p>Writing the review also makes my conversation about the book more interesting and confident. And the more I talk about a book, the better I retain the information in it, so it's a double benefit. I've also found that reading the review a couple years later will quickly bring back more of the book than I get by just flipping through the pages or wracking my brain to remember what I read.<p>Writing a review on a book doesn't take long, maybe 20 minutes per book, it helps my writing skills and helps me read less passively.

They're much less likely than they used to be, and the drive will catch them with a checksum when read back, but capacities are so high that the probability of hitting one when reading back a full drive is nearly %100. This makes RAID-5 and other parity-based striping systems almost completely unviable these days -- you'll never be able to rebuild the array from n-1 drives without hitting a single-bit error.

I think Goldberg shutting down the site because he had 250k user base while FB had got to a 1m says a lot. If Goldberg was really a visionary, the 1m user base should have inspired him and his team. (2) Montreal? Why? You want to dominate a web platform for University students and you go to Montreal? (3) Support network.

1744294,comment,1743513,1743513,0,0,jseliger,,,"A lot of the comments here about memory, recall, and learning are dealt with in Daniel T. Willingham's <i>Why Don't Students Like School</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047059196X?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=047059196X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047059196X?ie=UTF8&tag=...</a>), which describes a lot of things, including how we move from a state of no knowledge to shallow knowledge to deep knowledge in particular problem domains. People with no knowledge and who have some introduced tend not to retain that knowledge well; people who have shallow knowledge tend not to connect that knowledge to other knowledge; and people who have deep knowledge can fit new information into existing schemas, webs, or ideas much more effectively than those who can't.<p>It's not an easy process, moving from one state to another, and it's also not a binary one. Willingham's focus is on how teachers can do this more effectively, but he also describes how people in general can or should.<p>I'm guessing that we can't remember books because many books give us relatively shallow knowledge and because most books have too many details for us to remember the finer points of them. But this probably changes over time: when I used to read fiction as a teenager or just after I started college, I mostly remember whether I liked the book or not. Now I'm in grad school for English and tend to remember the plots, how characters express themselves, the main conflicts in the novel and what those main conflicts signal, etc. So in reading <i>Emma</i> again this week, I realized that many of Austen's characters are actually judging themselves when they judge others, because their views of what is ""right"" or ""proper"" is mostly about preferences (and I actually wrote a post on the subject: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/09/29/jane-austen-emma-and-what-characters-are-doing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/09/29/jane-austen-emma-and-what-cha...</a>). Now I'm likely to remember when Emma admits she's wrong and so forth.<p>Granted, I've read the novel before, but that happens with other novels too.<p>Finally, I now often write blog posts about books or take notes on them using Devonthink Pro as described by Steven Berlin Johnson: <a href=""http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/0002...</a> .

Since there are so many great phones, we wanted to make the selection process a little easier for people who are in the market for a new one.<p>Why not just say 'So we only list Android phones that have google search by default and not Bing."" Or put that in the headline for the database page.<p>Surely any Android phone lets you use google services since they all have web browsers.<p>No worries, my point was that what they are doing is intentionally misleading (IMO) and I think it is a step away from what they profess to be their mission, and is the kind of thing that damages trust in their results.",1285869657

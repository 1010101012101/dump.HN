Google got big just as quickly and had access to as much sensitive data, but avoided any major privacy missteps.",1203386192

118582,comment,118106,118545,0,0,lojic,,,"Hard to say what would be a good reason for you, but I had used vim for a couple of years and really liked it. I still like its conciseness.<p>I became interested in emacs because of the good support for Lisp w/ slime, etc. Plus, I thought I'd prefer extending my editor with Lisp vs. vim script - I was right. I hadn't written any vim scripts while using vim, but I've quickly written many little elisp functions and bound them to convenient keys.<p>The dired (directory editing) feature is great. I like the way it handles buffers & bookmarks better than vim. I actually use the calendar feature.<p>I like how the functions you right get integrated into the help facility automatically.<p>The ""Learning GNU Emacs"" book is great.<p>The architecture seems better than vim.<p>I wasn't thrilled with all the ""chording"", but I'm writing new functions and making the keybindings comfortable for me.<p>The help facility seems superior to me. Dynamic abbreviations, window/frame control.<p>I'm sure there's more, but I only switched about 10 days ago :)",1203385322

I've heard that one of the defining aspects of Western civilization's success is its emphasis on the written word, which is our most common form of linear, logical mind maps.<p>Where does lateral thinking come into this process, and has it been useful in your experience?  I tend to think counter to the conventional wisdom, and people tend to think such ideas weird.<p>While it's normal to say this is a good thing, I'm not sure it is and am curious if there is any data on the usefulness of lateral thinking.",1203383356

The more valuable the intellectual property you give up, the more bragging rights you get. The entire industry reminds me of Tom Sawyer's whitewashing trick:<p><i>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it â€“ namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.</i>

If you brought forward the ""me"" from 1995 to present day, and said only one of us could live, I'd pick my instance. In the same way the Nile is continually changing and made up of different water molecules, the ""river "" of consciousness is not dependent on individual water molecules, but arises out of a pattern of groups of them. On the same token, it's precise identity is in continual flux (fluid :) and dependent on its location in time and space and the arrangement of it's molecules.",1203382801

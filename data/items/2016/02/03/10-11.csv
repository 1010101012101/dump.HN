Heartbleed, the most famous of these issues in the last few years, would have not occurred on systems like OpenBSD, were it not for its developers&#x27; quest for optimization in their malloc wrapper.<p>I&#x27;ve seen buffer overflows in Java, too. It&#x27;s immune to writing past the end of the arrays, but it&#x27;s not immune to, say, smart programmers using one large array to hold multiple buffers that they manually manage, because who knows when the GC kicks in and wrecks havoc. Python may be immune to use-after-frees, but the OpenGL bindings that it calls through the FFI aren&#x27;t.<p>To err is human, and languages like Rust don&#x27;t make it less likely to err, they just give you new opportunities to do it.<p>Moving to a safe language like Rust would help, absolutely, but to a far lesser degree than people hope. It would close far fewer cans of worms than the hive mind hopes, and it&#x27;s so new no one really knows how big its own can of worms is.",1454497190

At work you do not need that shit. Normal Facebook can be excellent for professional networking and sometimes way better than Linkedin but why Facebook for productivity?<p>You want to communicate? Every productivity solution has some chat, which can extend in seconds to a multi-user chat, to a call or video call (Hangouts, Office365). But yeah you can also use Slack, Hipchat or whatever, no rocket science for a decade. You want a feed of your coworkers? Why? You want to follow coworkers? Why? You have Facebook already.<p>Email, messaging, video calls, an office with collaborating features and a task/ticket management solution. THAT&#x27;S IT, you do not need more. Depending on the industry and profession some more and specialized stuff might be required (such as CRM, SFA).<p>I am wondering how the Facebook London remote team got the approval for this nonsense from Zuckerberg.",1454497090

11025788,comment,11025382,11025382,0,0,V-2,,,"I feel the UI (of the desktop version) is a bit lacking.<p>Within one minute from installing it, the following happened.<p>I added a note: a text note, fine. So a side bar opens...<p>Why is it only ever a side bar? I have a 1920px wide monitor - not really unusual - but you&#x27;re forcing me to edit my notes in a fixed 700px sidebar, the rest of the screen estate just darkened out. Evernote lets me use all my screen.<p>But I&#x27;ve typed some stuff in. So, I&#x27;m clicking on &quot;Add text note&quot;, the first most obvious call-to-action that catches my eye. A dialog pops up: &quot;The note has unsaved changes. Really leave?&quot;. Well, I just clicked on &quot;Add text note&quot;, what do you mean?<p>Only after a while I realized that I&#x27;m not supposed to click on the most prominent (white on black) caption bar at the top, but on the greenish &quot;Add&quot; in bottom right corner. Even though the title does say &quot;Add text note&quot;, which is as explicit as it gets.<p>Okay, time to edit my note. It opens in preview mode by default, I still have to click on a floating button to make it editable - another little mental bump, but okay.<p>I can click on an eye icon to get a preview of the note. Once I do that, the eye icon vanishes, and I&#x27;m left with an uneditable note. That&#x27;s quite weird, normally the &quot;eye&quot; icon would just be replaced with a symbol indicating return to edit mode, allowing to switch back and forth with no fuss. Makes sense, especially sice it&#x27;s easy to anticipate that the preview function would often be used just to quickly catch a glimpse of whether our work (markup, etc.) looks fine, and further we go, it&#x27;s not a Rembrandt painting : )<p>Not here, though - I click on the eye, but in order to resume editing I have to move mouse cursor to the left now, and tap on the &quot;<-&quot; back button. Or, as it turns out, anywhere outside of the magical 700px wide (36% of my screen) get-things-done area.<p>I guess I&#x27;m sort of a power user (I&#x27;m a software dev for starters), so these confusions don&#x27;t stop me for more than 5 seconds each. It is frustrating nevertheless, because being computer-savvy, I&#x27;m not used to that. And when my mum clicks &quot;Add text note&quot; only to be asked if she really wants to cancel all changes, I can tell you she&#x27;ll look like a deer in headlights rather than mumble &quot;what&#x27;s this bs&quot; as I did ; )<p>I understand you&#x27;re an indie dev, but hallway usability testing doesn&#x27;t require hiring focus groups etc., all it takes is have a few people sit in front of the monitor and watch them go at it",1454496248

I&#x27;ve been meditating semi-regularly for about a year now, usually every day for a long while and then generally short periods of no meditation at all.<p>To give some context: I&#x27;m currently dealing with the effects of what in hindsight was a slowly ramping up &#x27;social burnout&#x27; that has left me with quite a bit of social anxiety, general anxiety, and somewhat unstructured lifestyle where I can easily spend days doing &#x27;whatever I want&#x27; (freelancer with savings). I also at some point developed dependence on alcohol and weed, although that&#x27;s been relatively easy to deal with when I keep my life simple and calm.<p>On top of that I&#x27;ve just been diagnosed with (mild) autism - the asperger&#x27;s variety - although I suspect that I might not have been diagnosed as such without the anxious, stressful and unstructured life that I&#x27;ve been leading these past years. Too early to tell though.<p>I can have immense trouble concentrating on something, especially when there&#x27;s some &#x27;problem&#x27; in my life, and I have to all but give up on being productive if this problem is of the social kind. My mind just cannot keep from going back to it, analyze it, take it apart, and so on.<p>It can be <i>ridiculously</i> difficult for me to leave the house, eat food, get enough sleep, or do simple things like laundry or take a shower. Without external prompts, I just sort of sit around reading, play games, follow some obsession, worry, &#x27;monologue&#x27; to myself, stop eating, and avoid social contact. This eventually turns my thoughts and behavior darker, if I let it continue.<p>On the other hand, it can also be <i>ridiculously</i> difficult for me to stop and take a rest when I&#x27;m in &#x27;meet my one deadline&#x27; mode, or actively busy with things. I decide to do all the things at once and don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m in over my head until it&#x27;s too late.<p>Balance is clearly not my talent, and, as is perhaps typical of those on the &#x27;spectrum&#x27;, I have trouble switching gears. It&#x27;s like my mind controls like a big-ass tanker ship, while others are more like cars or trucks.<p>I still struggle with these things. And getting, if anything, has made it more difficult. Things are a bit quiet overall, but it takes me even more effort to snap out of things, to stop overanalyzing, to switch gears. I suppose that&#x27;s what happens when you do a thing for so long.<p>Some things have helped a bit, like prioritizing &#x27;simple&#x27; things like getting healthy food in me, going for walks/general exercise, taking in more sunlight, and setting small goals for myself. I&#x27;ve become more &#x27;tactical&#x27; in the challenges I take on, as being only &#x27;strategic&#x27; is not practical enough.<p>But the <i>one</i> thing that has, across the board, been most effective, is meditation. I meditate for about 20 minutes, and it&#x27;s like rebooting my system. The effects are smaller when I keep getting distracted, which is frequently, but they&#x27;re still huge in comparison to anything else I can do (nap, walk, read, etc.).<p>Sometimes I have a headache, and brief session makes it disappear. Sometimes I can&#x27;t snap out of a social conflict I&#x27;m analyzing while I should really do some work that I&#x27;ve been putting off for days already, but after a brief session (which I&#x27;d also been putting off) I just sit down and start, which is more than half the battle.<p>Meditation has helped me eat better, because after a session I am suddenly aware of the hunger, and I have the peace to let myself make some food. It&#x27;s helped me sleep better by quieting down a reeling mind that would usually keep me up for hours. It&#x27;s helped me deal slightly better with conflicts, introspective &#x27;insights&#x27;, depressive days, and moods by reminding me to not take it all to seriously, and giving me some perspective (through absence of obsessive thought drowning everything else out).<p>Hell, if it&#x27;s late afternoon and I have no energy to spare (quite common), a quick session gives me an energy boost and allows me to use the rest of my day (whether it&#x27;s <i>actual</i> relaxation or work).<p>The form of meditation I do is mostly the zen variety, which is the form that is probably the most popular (mindfulness). It&#x27;s really just sitting and the only &#x27;effort&#x27; is to not go after every thought that tries to pull you with it, but rather observe that thought itself and try to let it go (but not try too hard!).<p>I use the Headspace app, which is awesome, but there are plenty of free resources too. I light a candle as a ritual, which means nothing to me in itself but helps me get in the mindset, so to speak. I have a little bench thingy that I can sit on, and simply seeing it in my room can &#x27;trigger&#x27; me to use it.<p>As a &#x27;thinking&#x27; type of guy, I also currently devour books on the topics of (zen) buddhism and meditation/mindfulness in general, because, well, my cognitive side needs some tickling too to keep at it. But the actual practice of sitting has been the most important part.<p>I can recommend the following stuff, in no particular order:<p>- books by Alan Watts, in particular &#x27;The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are&#x27; as well as &#x27;The Wisdom of Insecurity&#x27;\n- The Suzuki&#x27;s: Shunryu Suzuki for practice and &#x27;contemplation&#x27;, and D.T. Suzuki one for the academic stuff)\n- Trying Not To Try, somewhat practical, mostly insightful, and just fun to read<p>And there&#x27;s other stuff I can&#x27;t think of right now.",1454495581

Having a compiler available can make it substantially easier to bootstrap a toolchain to compromise the system fully.<p>Another issue is that it presents a privilege escalation concern. If you compile stuff in a user account on the production machines that will be run with root privileges, if someone compromises that user account they can now put in place a compiler wrapper to embed their own code. Even if you don&#x27;t do anything else in that account (e.g. sudo)  that&#x27;d let them e.g. capture passwords the compilation presents another risk.

Simply the non-enlightened state of mind, caring about distinctions etc.<p>And then you go on explaining how you can&#x27;t rationalize yourself out of that state-of-mind. That&#x27;s true. When you want to relax you step back. You don&#x27;t &quot;engineer disturbances&quot; or whatever. You step back and calm down. You breathe, you shake off the ballast etc.<p>> So, in order to fully relax, one has to engineer disturbances that are less stressful than the stress you are trying to eliminate, and to modify your approach as you go.\nIt also gets complicated because there are feedback loops in the system. Manipulating one thing, brings up another thing to deal with etc...<p>I think you&#x27;re trapping yourself in your own traps. Relaxation isn&#x27;t an intellectual thing like that.

Do you mean getting rid of anxiety? Where you can worry about the fact that you worry? Sure those are tougher nuts to solve just mentally. You often need external things for that, like exercise, therapy, medication etc.<p>But I often feel worked up on some issue to the point of faster heartbeat etc, and then I feel like &quot;hey, let&#x27;s not get worked up so much&quot; and then my heart slows down again. People are often advised to &quot;count to 10&quot; in such cases. This monotony looks a bit like meditation-chants. Perhaps it&#x27;s a kind of mini-meditation, I don&#x27;t know.<p>One thing I know is that trying to engineer it, thinking with that usual nerdish attitude doesn&#x27;t help (at least me).

Use libraries from:  your friends, a coder you respect, or write your own.<p>You don't complain about not knowing where to look to get a Linux distribution do you?  Freedom leads to fragmentation, but the fact that there are a million Linux distributions doesn't make Linux any less powerful.<p>If you want an Ubuntu, don't use Lisp.  More power to you.  Some people just want to get the job done quickly with at little thinking as possible.  I know I feel that way sometimes.  But if you want an Arch, where you built the system from the ground up, then you want Lisp.  And at the end of the day when something breaks, you just might know how to fix it. ;)",1268632690

To use a simple example, America is full of all-you-can-eat buffets, but if you tried to pull a business like this off immediately after the fall of the soviet union, your restaurant would crash and burn. As a novelty, everyone in town would try to ""game"" it in Russia, until you adjust the written rules to the point where it isn't an all-you-can-eat anymore. I don't even think people would do it because they're particularly hungry, but because they're used to gaming the system every chance they get.<p>Russia has a multigenerational culture of bribes and gaming the system. You can never root that out in a few years - it takes many decades of very carefully constructed policies to root that out.

Once you learn to think functionally, it's just as natural as writing imperative code and doesn't take any more time.  In fact, once you get really comfortable with the abstractions, you can move much more quickly, through complex recursion and all.",1268629584

I get your product but not your business.<p>A business turns something into money.  What is it that you are turning into money?  How are you turning this into money?<p>This also reminds me of a not-so-recent HN post describing different business personalities that are needed in a startup:  the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  It looks like you're strong in the technician area, but what about the entrepreneurial area?  Your video describes how your product works--that's how technicians think.  It doesn't directly address the user's problems--that's how an entrepreneur thinks.  What problem are you solving for your users and is their problem bad enough that they will pay someone money to solve it?",1268629417

If he doesn't understand important principles like, ""there's so much variation in programmer productivity that, if you know this guy is really good, it might be worth it to pay him 5x as much as the other guy we're considering"", he doesn't know how to do his job effectively.

8381813,comment,8377345,8379134,1,0,darren0,,,"Fleet is used only to bootstrap the system.  It has very little to do with the larger architecture of stampede or cattle.  I view orchestration and scheduling as two completely different topics.  When looking at IaaS the scheduling needs are initially quite simple.  As such I don&#x27;t have a mature scheduler and really don&#x27;t intend on building one.  As your requirements mature the needs for more complex scheduling is needed.  I&#x27;ve gone down that path many times and it snowballs so quickly into a very difficult problem.<p>With cattle I’ve purposely decided to defer the scheduling needs to something like Mesos or possibly YARN.  I don’t intend to try to reinvent that wheel.  I have yet to do that integration.<p>The CF Diego approach is one that seem very common today.  In general all of the Docker “orchestration” platforms out there today are mostly just Docker plus a scheduler.  This approach is great, as long as you don’t need complex orchestration.  As the CF folks point out, complex orchestration is hard.  If you can remove the need to orchestrate and build a system that needs only a scheduler it is generally much simpler and easier to scale.<p>The problem I have is that stampede focuses heavily on real world application loads and boring practical issues that exist in crufty old applications that exist in the wild.  These apps have requirements that necessitate complex orchestration.  As such, with stampede I tackle orchestration head on.  I try to find a sane and scalable approach to it.  Which is really quite difficult, but it is my area of expertise.  I feel if I have a platform that can excel at both orchestration (from the native capabilities of cattle) and scheduling (by leveraging a mature scheduler framework) I’ll have an extremely capable base to build the next generation of infrastructure.",1411969546

TCP is not the optimal solution and PCC may very well be better but there is just no way to use a new and unfair-to-reno and ignore all consequences.

These days CUBIC is the default in Linux, Windows has their own algorithm. All of these behave in a very similar way to the old Reno, they all have the basic structure of AIMD - Additional Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (slowly increasing on no signal and fast decrease on loss signal). in the case of CUBIC and H-TCP the slow increase is not very slow and the fast decrease was slowed down to handle very high speed links and high latency (high bandwidth delay product).",1411968876

Someone sees a FB ad, clicks it, and converts without any other touch-points in their path to conversion.  I think we can all agree FB would get 100% attribution credit in this instance.<p>But the second you throw in any sort of existing brand awareness generated by other channels, or FB&#x27;s contribution to said awareness for driving conversions in more last-touch inclined channels, it becomes very murky indeed.<p>There&#x27;s a reason all of the 3rd party dynamic attribution vendors like VisualIQ, Convertro and Adometry have been bought up by the big players.<p>Would love to know your thoughts on solving for this problem though as it is increasingly a large one as the targeting side of the display world continues to eclipse progress of actually measuring the performance of said display efforts at a staggering rate.",1411968746

8381780,comment,8381493,8381692,2,0,shostack,,,"I would agree with quite a bit of this.<p>However I would disagree with your statement that it is a de factor admission of failure of monetizing all that data.  If anything, it is Facebook laying the foundations for a very powerful data asset once it gets the other pieces of the puzzle in place.  Let&#x27;s not forget that Google&#x27;s own GDN was once the red headed step-child of the display space only a handful of years ago due to quality issues (and the Search Partner Network still suffers from quite a bit of this as covered in a recent article on Search Engine Land[1]).<p>In any event, all of this data that they have, and that Google has, etc. are largely wasted because of both of their failures to leverage it to the fullest capacity and solve the issue of cross-channel attribution analysis and optimization.<p>Perfect example...it is 2014--why the heck can&#x27;t I get view-through revenue data in the AdWords UI when using the AdWords conversion tag and/or syncing with GA? You most certainly have the data.  Why should that be limited to advertisers who pay for DFA to get the exposure-to-conversion reporting capabilities?<p>More importantly, why has nobody tackled the truly large scale, cross-industry problem of true global frequency capping and tracking?  I realize it is in part because there is little incentive to play nice with others, but that seems like a problem Google should try to solve as it would provide tremendous value in the form of a drastic reduction in wasted impressions (and thus higher-performance display campaigns).  In the end, it is the users that suffer from being bombarded by ads from multiple networks/DSPs/etc. because of the few options to limit exposure across initiatives without setting up complex audience segmentation and negative lists.<p>Getting all of this data under one roof/GUID is only useful if there are tools to optimize against it at that scale and level of complexity.  That means making data-driven attribution a priority and proving the incremental value of impressions and view-throughs.  Letting advertisers view their data through multiple attribution lenses or define their own is still falling short because attribution should not be based on static values.  This is a problem that Google has the chops to solve, and that the average advertiser lacks the resources, expertise, and technology for. I&#x27;ve been pretty disappointed in your solution thus far.  This is data you should expose to the masses in an actionable manner that would dramatically help them sell Google display solutions. Admittedly I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try GA Premium&#x27;s data-driven attribution features, and I&#x27;m dying to know how Adometry will be incorporated into your products, but it can&#x27;t come soon enough.<p>As it stands right now though, I still can&#x27;t easily show with data that view-throughs are worth a damn--even if I did have said revenue data.  Oh, and don&#x27;t get me started on video display units...why has AdWords for Video still not been fully merged with the main AdWords platform?  It is ridiculous that I need to use a separate platform and split my budgets/data/reporting if I want to run Trueview ads for a retargeting campaign.<p>Anyway, thanks for bearing the brunt of my unloading on Google&#x27;s display efforts.  I&#x27;ve been particularly frustrated with them as of late, and now that I&#x27;m client-side without the massive collective budgets I sat on top of as a senior-level individual at a top agency partner, I don&#x27;t get as many opportunities to share my candid thoughts to Googlers about how to improve things.

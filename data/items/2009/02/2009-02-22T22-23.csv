However, this was a subjective estimation of their success in achieving the deal objectives (see figure 2, on page 8), and less than half had carried out a formal review process. When we measured each one against our independent benchmark, based on comparative share performance one year after deal completion, the result was almost a mirror opposite. We found that only 17% of deals had added value to the combined company, 30% produced no discernible difference, and as many as 53% actually destroyed value. In other words, 83% of mergers were unsuccessful in producing any business benefit as regards shareholder value.""<p>- <a href=""http://www.imaa-institute.org/docs/m&a/kpmg_01_Unlocking%20Shareholder%20Value%20-%20The%20Keys%20to%20Success.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imaa-institute.org/docs/m&a/kpmg_01_Unlocking...</a>",1235343331

I hadn't bothered to look for anything about allergies there in years.<p>Yes, my three allergists have all called it ""oral allergy syndrome."" One of them speculated my problem might have to do with ""volatile oils,"" considering I'm also allergic to the <i>smell</i> of the raw produce. 19th and 20th century chemistry is amazing. Did you know that ""flavors"" for factory foods are food perfumes, top secret stuff concocted by perfume chemists? I learned that around ten years ago in a book called <i>Mauve</i>, about the history of fabric dying, of all things. (Some years earlier, I concluded the scent that remains long after slapping on some Polo is blueberry from old Betty Crocker blueberry muffin mix.)<p>So the thought of being allergic to volatile oils made pretty good sense to me. But as soon as I say ""volatile oils"" to people in combination with ""cooking,"" they get all confused. Maybe they think I want to solve my problems by blowing up my kitchen or setting the building on fire or starting a heated argument. I'm happy to think that ""denatured proteins"" will sound a lot less volatile.<p>BTW, I'm a she, not a he. I also happen to be blondish and thin with a weak voice. I find that many people in real life, whom I shall not bother to classify here by occupation or sex, don't take me seriously.

1382444,comment,1381536,1382415,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"I tried Songbird, but that was just too buggy to consider using seriously. Nice idea, but it was just as bad as iTunes in my experience.<p>I used Amarok before the upgrade, and liked that pretty well for a while. Easy keyboard shortcuts are great.<p>So far, I've been sticking with Foobar because it has a nice amount of customization built in, and components for everything else. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good one to sync to my phone (not that iTunes offered that of course...), so I'm trying doubleTwist for that.<p>However, I'm not really set as to what I'm using, and I'm still looking around to see if there's anything that catches my eye. Must haves are good library management for about 8000 or so files, keyboard shortcuts, an easy search method, and some form of filter pane view (iTunes did do those last two right at least). Any recommendations?<p>Edit: I should add that I'd really like to replace doubleTwist. It takes forever to start itself up, and it doesn't even automatically scan my music folder for new media. However, I really could use some form of automatic management for my Droid, since it's my only music player other than my computer at the moment.",1274925555

You're ignoring several factors:<p>* Even though Microsoft may own 90% of the market, the fact that their company as a whole (which includes other markets) is worth less than Apple is telling. The investors certainly don't think that they are an underdog.<p>* A few years ago Microsoft own <i>95%</i> of the market. (i.e. The trend is towards a shrinking strangle-hold on the market)<p>* The 'market' usually refers to the <i>general</i> PC market which (IIRC) includes corporate purchases. Most corporate purchases for the foreseeable future will probably remain in Microsoft's court, but that doesn't prevent Apple from taking over the <i>personal</i> computer market. [Yea, I know PC stands for 'Personal Computer,' but here we are referring to personal in terms of ownership, instead of personal in terms of desktops vs mainframes.] I would definitely <i>not</i> call Apple the underdog in terms of personal/family computers.<p>* Apple has great mind-share right now, as well as a number of devices that tie-in well with their Macs. Those devices (iPhone,iPad) are at the top of a lot of people's minds and at the cutting edge of their respective niches. Those devices will probably do well at driving people towards Macs when they next upgrade their desktop/laptop even though that probably isn't their ultimate goal.<p>* You're ignoring the other markets that Apple is in where they are <i>not</i> the underdog (mp3 players, tablet devices).<p><pre><code>  > Also who is the ""you"", that you are referring to?\n</code></pre>\nTo the poster of the comment I was replying to?

Nobody can force you to buy from Target when you're happy with what's carried by WalMart.  You can't do this with the App Store, and Apple goes out of its way to prevent you from loading software from elsewhere.<p>On top of that, the inconsistency of the enforcement of App Store guidelines and the moving target set by Apple makes it seem like they are suffering from some growing pains.  It doesn't look like they've really made up their mind about what impression they want people to get, other than some ""slick"" user experience.<p>Bottom line is that on top of dealing with the unpredictable market out there, developers also have to put up with a very fickle supply chain with no alternative channels.

I found it very helpful for documents of more than a couple of pages, and even when I want to be fairly particular about a single page document such as my resume.",1268020827

I know I will be checking this page out on a regular basis to see what I might be able to add to the discussion, and what I might learn from the rest of the HN community.",1268020819

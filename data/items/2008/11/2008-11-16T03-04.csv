I typically only know what the _minimum_ budgeted salary is - that is, the lowest skilled employee I can justify bringing into a position.  At the top end, sky is the limit - if you can justify $200K/year based on contribution, we'll be lucky to bring you on board.<p>And yes, I immediately tell all applicants at the conclusion of the interview process precisely what I think they can command in the peninsula economy, and at our company (65th percentile), based on what I know about their experience, the listed (and back door references), the local economy, and what our needs are.  I don't negotiate salary - that's the number we offer them, and they can either take it or leave it.  The information they provide on their salary, and the reason they are leaving their last position, just happen to be two pieces of information that feed into that final number.<p>The difference, of course, being that I know very little about how smart they are, and how much they can get things done, whereas the candidate knows almost _everything_ about themselves.  And having the candidate hold back that information just makes my job more difficult, rather than easier.  Certainly not what I'm looking for in an employee.<p>They should be able to walk into the interview and tell me to within $5K precisely what they should be making.<p>Remember - I'm a hiring manager, not an HR staffer.  I see my job in life to maximize my employee's compensation, ensure that they are making more at my company than they would anywhere else.  Every single day consists of me trying to increase what my employees make by giving them more training, more tools, more projects, more guidance, more time to focus on what interests them.<p>Also remember - it hurts an employee just as much to be overcompensated as it does to be undercompensated.",1226807957

Do I still have to pay even though I wasn't satisfied?<p>If a bunch of contributors vote 'no' and pull their money then how do I improve the project and get them onboard again if it's going to be OSS? With shareware, I can improve the product and catch them on the next release.",1226807861

365752,comment,365637,365637,0,0,jerf,,,"Personally, after all the efforts of the past couple of decades to get women involved in college have succeeded to the point that women now make up the majority of college students (with the trends continuing to favor even more women for the forseeable future), if computer science is actually still <i>dropping</i>, the possibility that it is simply an outlier must be taken seriously.<p>If there are relevant differences between genders w.r.t. to how one chooses a profession (and the negation of that statement would fly in the face of everything we know about such differences), then in all likelihood the gender ratios will be normally distributed. So, I mean outlier in the technical sense of a statistical distribution. There <i>will</i> be extremes at one end or another, and the mere fact of their existence is testimony that gender differences of a statistical nature do indeed exist, not proof that there is some other factor. If we actually got all professions to strict 50/50 proportions, that would be proof positive of major meddling.<p>I mean that first paragraph seriously. In the absence of such efforts, discrimination of some form would be a plausible hypothesis, but given how many other fields have overcome this and the dominant culture of universities, I find it increasingly difficult to believe the members of the field are really the problem. Computer scientists can hardly be blamed for a culture that considers them nerds and tells girls they shouldn't be nerds, if that is the root problem. (Nor will the obvious solutions work; protesting that you aren't really nerds is not a good approach. Making tons of money was a reasonably effective approach, though that has lost its apparent inevitability. :) )",1226807520

That would be way too hard for any developer.<p>Our election algorithm looks at a lot of metrics before deciding whether to pass a project.  Our goal is to pass projects that have broad community consensus that they meet the project requirements. We obviously want to fail projects that have obvious stability problems, or that don't do what the proposal says.  We're working hard to make it difficult to game the system, and I'd be interested in any thoughts you might have to make things more fair.",1226807117
365749,comment,365274,365650,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"<i>In Manhattan, some of the top doctors have stopped participating with insurance companies, because the companies (which are manned by the sorts of people who would be in guard towers of prison camps in other kinds of societies) often refuse to pay for bullshit reasons, leaving the doctor unpaid, or ""negotiate"" pay that is below subsistence level for the doctor. We've had a two-tier health system (insured vs. not) for decades, but now we're approaching a three-tier system (self-insured vs. crappily insured vs. not) because of the sliminess of insurance companies and the crappiness of their policies.</i><p>If you are not from the US and/or not already familiar with US healthcare, listen to this person. This is the sort of experience 99% of people on insurance get. Sure, we have insurance, but it's a crapshoot whether the company is going to actually pay for all the expenses it should be. This lulls the ""insured"" into a false sense of security, and provides a great incentive to not go to the doctor.",1226806726

Does the vote need to be 100%? That sounds like a pain in the ass -- I want my software, now.<p>This is also not very good for the developer. They have to perfect the software to please all the contributors before getting paid. How long until everyone agrees that it's ready? Where am I supposed to take it if I walk? I just wasted all this time writing code, thinking I was going to get paid and now I have to try and sell software that I didn't even come up with the idea for.

365744,comment,365488,365673,0,0,randomwalker,,,"That makes sense, and it's likely that if I read through the entire book that you linked to, I'd grasp it pretty clearly. But it was certainly out of my mental reach as an 18-year old. And believe me, I tried.<p>In general, it appears that our ability to ask philosophical questions, especially of the mathematical variety, far outpaces our ability to find answers or even <i>comprehend</i> answers that others have come up with. It is highly plausible that this is linked to the disturbingly high occurrence of depression, bordering on mental illness, among mathematicians. (I know enough mathematicians personally for that observation to have some statistical validity, but anyone who has read many biographies of mathematicians should get the sense of it.)<p>What I'm trying to say is that while many of the questions of mathematical philosophy pique our curiosity greatly, and it can certainly be a rewarding experience to get a taste of the beauty of the field, everyone should have a mental threshold for how much they are willing to get involved. Perhaps this is obvious to other people, but since it was a painful lesson for me, I feel obliged to share it :-)",1226806281

She knows enough to seek out a developer and is willing to invest in software that no one else has used?

OOo and Google Docs are good, free, alternatives.<p>Most open-source software projects are started as some hacker's pet project.

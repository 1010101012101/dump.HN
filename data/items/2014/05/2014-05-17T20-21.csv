7761040,comment,7760790,7760790,7,0,logicallee,,,"I&#x27;ll delete this if you don&#x27;t like it, but I think this is why non-engineers like Steve Jobs, Jony Ives, and a person at HP I won&#x27;t name, were able to make remarkably good consumer products without knowing how they work.  It may be better for a non-engineer to design a laptop than for someone who actually knows how it is put together and exactly how it works.<p>Of course, in a narrow sense, this means such a person isn&#x27;t really designing it at all: the real engineers are, which may cause resentment.  There is a very good chance that a non-programmer can design a programming IDE that is two or three orders of magnitude better (by whatever standard) than the status quo.  This means such a person can&#x27;t actually implement any part of it, or even know exactly what it&#x27;s doing.<p>Quite a surprising conclusion.<p>By the way I have experienced this myself, when designing for a target I didn&#x27;t know yet: after/while I was learning it, the resulting design iteration process was much worse than when I didn&#x27;t know the implementation details.  It&#x27;s harder to think from the user&#x27;s perspective, after you have been forced to think from the implementation&#x27;s perspective.",1400360264

Think about it.<p>You keep offering your premise &#x27;DRM has no effect on piracy because it be broken&#x27; - as an argument, but it&#x27;s only your opinion, not a fact. <i>You</i> don&#x27;t put up with DRM because it&#x27;s technically easy for your to circumvent, but a lot of people do and are even willing to forego consuming something until it becomes affordable or accessible. By your logic, DVD sales and streaming revenue should already be zero because pirated versions are available. Since people are clearly still willing to pay for these products and services, how do you explain that?<p><i>We already agreed that it&#x27;s not because of piracy. So why can&#x27;t they drop DRM from all this then?</i><p>You keep saying this, but I <i>don&#x27;t</i> agree with it. DRM makes piracy more difficult, which imposes a delay on the time between release and the availability of pirated versions; it limits piracy to those who know how to break the DRM, making it easier to identify vectors of piracy; it distinguishes pirated from non-pirated content and so has an evidentiary function in copyright infringement cases.<p>It <i>also</i> provides a way of tracking distributors&#x27; activity and preserving publishers&#x27; options to serve media to new channels on a timescale of their choosing, allowing them to figure out how to market it, package it, and charge for it, which are reasonable sorrt of things for businesses to want to do.<p>I&#x27;m not going to keep up with his conversation if you just keep repeating your own opinion over and over and trating it as fact.

Those drinking the Kool-Aid will probably say you should always use it.<p>Probably the biggest sticking point for me is not knowing how your program should be structured ahead of time. You&#x27;ll have trial and error along with plenty of refactoring, as you grapple with how the solution best fits the infrastructure you are writing for. Adding the overhead of writing tests for code/apis that are likely to change sounds like wasted effort. The fragmentation between different testing frameworks also doesn&#x27;t help, with each having their own learning curve.<p>Maybe people should focus on coding a minimum viable product, then revisit it after they understand better how their product should work in the infrastructure they are using. They will then have a better understanding of the tests they should write. The tests would likely come in handy as their program matures, and errors/downtime to their users becomes a bigger issue than pushing a product out the door.",1400359683

While transitioning to C++ in later courses did involve some pain points, I felt like python was a great way to ease into the programmer mindset and get the basic concepts out of the way before delving into the more low-level stuff like pointers, and later with OOP. Not to mention that Python is becoming the Lingua Franca for academic research due to its powerful mathematics packages, and I was immediately able to start programming for money at a university research lab right after I took the class. The realization that I could learn a skill like this and immediately earn money with it was incredibly powerful for me. While there may be &quot;better&quot; languages in terms of teaching programming concepts, the fact that python is so immediately useful in a large number of disciplines relevant to students (at least in a university) still makes it the best language to start learning with right now IMO.",1400359541

If you can get over the hurdle that is learning C (or really even just Java), you have the benefit of learning so much more about computing and the fact that types are implicitly being adhered to, memory is being managed beneath the surface, garbage collection, etc. I learned Java for my intro programming course and luckily had an instructor who really emphasized those topics. It made learning C and subsequently assembly much simpler. Had I started in Python, I don&#x27;t see really learning much more than &quot;wow, I can do some cool things with a computer.&quot; I suppose that&#x27;s okay if the class is advertised as programming for non-CS majors, but to teach Python as an introductory course for CS curriculum seems almost like robbery to me.

7760965,comment,7760790,7760790,51,0,weland,,,"I also wish that programming were a lot different today than it was when I started learning it. That being said, a lot of this article&#x27;s points are things I&#x27;ve heard before. They led to the development of Visual Basic & co., mostly by people who had no contact with the Smalltalk and Lisp environment in the 80s, while people who <i>did</i> were shrugging and throwing tantrums like WHY THE FUCK DIDN&#x27;T YOU FUCKING LIKE IT TEN YEARS AGO?<p>IMHO, all these things went down to the bottom of history because things like these:<p>> Anon the intern needs to be able to open up Programmingâ„¢ and click &#x27;New Web Form&#x27;<p>are adequate for people who usually don&#x27;t program, and extremely inadequate for people who usually do. Generally, and for good reasons, programmers will dislike a tool that hides implementation details for ease of operation. Past a certain level of complexity, the time spent manually doing the <i>right</i> cruft becomes significantly smaller than the time spent manually cleaning up after a smart tool.<p>I sympathize with Anon the intern, but perhaps he should rethink his expectations about complexity; if discoverability is a problem, perhaps he could switch to something that&#x27;s better documented?<p>And at the risk of sounding like an elitist schmuck who rants about how things were back in his day, <i>maybe</i> he ought to start with something other than web programming. The size and complexity of that tech stack is humongous, to the extent that a large proportion of those who <i>use</i> it don&#x27;t understand it more than two layers of abstraction down. Programs are also hard to pack and the environment that runs them is hard to setup. Because it involves at least two servers, possibly with several add-ons in order to allow the server-side languages to run, learning at least three languages (assuming server-side JS is an option), two of which (HTML and CSS) aren&#x27;t quite being used for their original purpose. This is a beginner&#x27;s nightmare and it has exactly nothing to do with the development tools.<p>And then there are things that are far harder to solve than they originally seem:<p>> I want to just type &#x27;email&#x27; and see a list of functions and libraries relating to email.<p>Related how :-)? Should MIME-related functions, needed to reason about attachments, also come up here? HTML parsing/converting, in case you need to deal with HTML email? Information cluttering does nothing to alleviate the opposite problem of information breadth: if Anon the intern&#x27;s problem is he doesn&#x27;t know how to Google for libraries or how to make efficient use of documentation, an IDE that presents him with a gazillion of possibly related things won&#x27;t help him. <i>Especially</i> when, like all beginning programmers, one of his main difficulties is correctly defining the problem he&#x27;s working on which, in turn, makes it likely for the solutions presented by the IDE to be nowhere even <i>close</i> to the one he needs, because the IDE (like Anon himself) thinks Anon is trying to solve another problem.<p>There is, on the other hand, a lot more truth in this:<p>> Tightening the feedback loop between writing code and seeing the results reduces the damage caused by wrong assumptions, lightens the cognitive load of tracking what should be happening and helps build accurate mental models of the system.<p>I do think that the real resolution to this problem is writing simpler programs whose state is easier to track. On the other hand, programming tools today suck considerably at presenting program meaning. Things like evaluating what an expression comprising entirely of constants, or at least evaluating it based on the default values of the variables involved, are well within reach for today&#x27;s tools, and yet programmers&#x27; calculators are still employed because 99% of the available IDEs couldn&#x27;t evaluate ADDR_MASK & IO_SEGMENT if the life of every kid in Africa depended on it.<p>This is wicked cool: <a href=""http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&context=hcii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&c...</a> .

Technology has made the process of shooting and editing a film a lot cheaper, but not across the board.

The event-related potentials measured at the scalp are microvolts and do not play well with other electronics nearby. Direct measurement of the motor cortex solves this problem, but most people aren't eager for brain surgery.

Customers know this, even if they express otherwise.<p>* Prior to an outage with a new service, responsiveness to outages is an unknown to customers. Uncertainty is a common source of anxiety, resulting in dissatisfaction.<p>* After a provider has responded positively to an outage, the uncertainty is alleviated, leaving the consumer with a greater sense of confidence. Remember, the consumer knows that regardless of provider, they run the risk of experiencing an outage, so this confidence becomes an anchor.<p>The tipping point is when frequent outages outweight the benefit of certainty.

The most straightforward pathway to take this business from $7 million to $70 million is to add 144 consultants.  They cost ~$40 million a year.  This would be a radically less attractive proposition if it were even possible, but if hiring 144 consultants was easy, you wouldn't have to buy a company to find only 16 of them.<p>Also, with a dev company you're buying some capital (software) plus renting access to brains.  With a consulting company, you're renting access to brains.  In all circumstances, brains can move.  Software rarely decides to do that spontaneously.<p>Edit to elaborate: The above is not a strike against doing consulting, by the way.  Thomas, for example, has frequently mentioned on HN two true, salient facts: a) almost all products fail miserably and b) the principals at a consulting company beat BigCo salaries approximately the second they call themselves ""principals at a consulting company"", which is very much not the case at most product companies.",1343915135

Of course, everything needs a use case, but Hadoop's place in the industry is not nearly as linear as people think it is.<p>The problem at the moment is people don't understand or know how to work with Hadoop, and that's what companies like Cloudera and Hortonworks are trying to solve, they are trying to show businesses, 1) How easy it is to deploy and 2) How to actually apply it to their current datasets. As someone who works at a Hadoop company, I can tell you that customers are still trying to wrap their heads around the technology, but the good news is, there is major progress.<p>I notice that, rather than Hadoop not giving enough to the user, the user is usually not giving enough to Hadoop. Hadoop challenges its users to think differently, which for some businesses can be quite difficult.<p>Regarding your question about NoSQL, since Hadoop is a platform/framework, there are already efforts to design databases that take advantage of the stack (namely, HDFS <-- Hadoop Distributed Filesystem). The most popular of these contributions is HBase which is a NoSQL (KV) Column Based DB, based on BigTable and much like Cassandra. It's horizontally scalable and is often referred to as ""highly consistent"".<p>Just to make a point though, there is so much that runs on the Hadoop platform. Top level projects like<p>* Pig (Scripting language developed by Yahoo, think SQL meets Python)<p>* Hive (Map RDBMS style schemas to data after it's been stored, let's you query data with SQL)<p>* HBase (NoSQL column based database store based on Google's BigTable, think Cassandra but very consistent)<p>* HDFS (Highly scalable and consistent distributed FS that was designed with MapReduce in mind)<p>^^ Some people use this JUST for storage since it's so easily scalable.<p>* There are others like Mahout which is machine learning, and in my opinion, black magic :P<p>Hope this helps :D",1343915026

Thanks for posting it Joel!<p>I've been trying to delicately balance the line between too many links versus not enough links. I created this site in the first place because I had seen tons of these ""best places to learn online"" compilations, but all of them had about 200 links. Way too many to actually be useful.<p>So I sought out to create something where there were only a few websites per category, but you could trust that they were all the best the web has to offer. As you can see from some of the comments on here, it's a fine line between too many and too few. I keep finding new ones that I think are too good not to include.<p>I've been thinking lately about how I can make this site more useful to my users. It seems like most people come once or twice, see a link they like and don't come back until the next time they want to learn something.  Although you could argue that's basically what the site is designed to do, I would like to see more repeat users. Any ideas?

Does the fact that one <i>needs</i> windows to run some of the software they like makes them a ""windows fan"" ? I used the three major desktop OSes on a regular basis. My laptop is a MBA running OS X, since that's what works best for me in a mobile computer. My desktop used to have a dual boot of linux for my main, daily computing needs, and Windows for games. I had to stop using linux since I switched to an ATI card that couldn't even tolerably work with Gnome 3.<p>Free software proponents tend to be less level headed on the issue. I think there aren't a lot of true ""windows fans"", but on the other hand, there are a lot of ""linux fans"" who live for the politics of free software. Lots of people use both proprietary and free software. I do. We are the ones who don't care for your politics. Unlike lots of hardcore linux proponents who are actively hostile to closed source software. 
On purely technical terms, I like linux better than windows because of its ecosystem (terminal software, scripting, unix philosophy) but certainly not because I'm enamored with the politics of the FSF. OTOH I use windows not because I love it, but because I need it. That's being practical.<p>People who put other groups into boxes, like ""anti linux"" ""Windows fans"" aren't practical, they're turning software into a religion.

  glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, ....);
</code></pre>
Why not:<p><pre><code>  glTexImage(my_texture_handle, ....);
</code></pre>
In addition to being used for accessing and modifying, the bindings are global values that affect rendering. In the example above, it affects which texture is used on the texture unit that has been selected by glActiveTexture. What a mess.<p>> With my limited knowledge of OpenGL, I know you get a number, describing a resource in video card memory. I bet for an OpenGL implementation, binding a resource id means finding a pointer to the resource. Sounds reasonable to me.<p>Wrong. There's a lot of software in between, before we start talking about GPU resources, so it refers to a structure on the CPU side. The integer-to-pointer lookup in between is another cache miss that we don't need (it has measurable L1 cache effects). This has, to some degree, been worked around by adding state objects like ""Vertex Array Objects"" (similar to D3D input layout).<p>> Would you rather get an invalid pointer that you should refrain from dereferencing (because you'll be reading from RAM, not GPU RAM)? That would've been a disaster.<p>Opaque pointers are used quite a lot in that way (e.g. D3D, via object pointers), it's a common idiom in C that adds a little type safety and documentation. In this case the pointers would be internal structures in the GL driver's user space. But you should not dereference them anyway. Unix uses integers as handles because the stuff it refers to is inside kernel memory, and you could poison the kernel by giving invalid pointers.<p>> Do you mean that you keep OpenGL-related info in your program's global state? In that case, you should be using some AppState object to keep the state (and pass a pointer around).<p>I don't. OpenGL does. In OpenGL, you have a global variable (actually: thread local) called the ""context"" which contains all the state of the rendering pipeline. In essence, it's a global variable that has side-effects when you access it.",1343914114

They're pushing their own agenda;<p>2. Such comments are typically one-sided Google can't or won't comment; and<p>3. That observation or opinion is often selective, misrepresentative, biased or a combination thereof.<p>So the next time you read a post about, oh I don't know, how someone's Adwords account was unfairly banned for no good reason and you see that the person claiming such just so happens to sell Valentine's Day gifts and it's the week of Valentine's Day then maybe just maybe that post is a misrepresentative PR stunt.<p>Likewise if you see people who worked for Google for a matter of months posting on every Google-related thread as some kind of self-proclaimed expert you should realize that they're pushing a particular viewpoint that paints the company in a worse light and them in a better light.<p>Chances are it didn't work out for them. Perhaps they have legitimate gripes. Perhaps they just didn't fit in. Maybe they even self-destructed and burned all their bridges. Whatever the case, their accounts of Google should at least be viewed skeptically.<p>So please apply some filters to such comments like:<p>- does this person know what they're talking about?<p>- what agenda are they pushing?<p>Now I'm no expert on Google (having worked here <2 years now) but let me give you my observations.<p>20% does still exist although from what I gather the nature of it has changed somewhat. It's probably fair to say that 20% time is less used now and when it is it's more for trying out or auditioning for a new team.<p>Personally I find it difficult to split my focus this way. This kind of compartmentalization is not my strong suit. I have the same issue with personal projects. When not at work I'll often think about work anyway. YMMV.<p>That all being said, I know of recent examples of people doing 20% time and I know of some cases where those 20% ideas turned into 100% time (if you will) on something new.<p>As far as daydreaming and other ""lateral thinking"" time goes, I'd say Google is by far the most accepting of this than any other company I personally have worked for. There are massage chairs, pool tables, tennis tables, consoles, etc around and people use them. They're not just decorative.<p>Google also as far as I've seen tolerates failure. I mean don't get me wrong, you're still better off succeeding than failing :) but you won't get fired if your project fails.<p>As far as individual experimentation goes I'll say this: Google is an example of something that I believe holds true for life in general: you get out of it as much as you put in.  This goes to the ""individual experimentation"" point. If you want to check out someone else's code, fix or add something and raise a CL for it you can.

If you read the manufacturer's advertisement for the USB genome scanner, it starts out by saying that it accepts a drop of saliva or blood and starts producing a genome. Then it sort of segues into saying that you'd want to separate out the chromosome which you want sequenced (which involves centrifuging the cells to separate the chromosomes by size), and cut that chromosome into manageable pieces (wet chemistry, more centrifuging), and then it will read most of that chromosome in its 6-hour lifetime, but of course you'll only have piecewise sequences to put together.

This ties into another, mostly informal hallway debate so far, over whether AI needs a replacement idea of ""AI-completeness"" to specify the problems that are <i>really</i> hard from an AI perspective. I wrote a short opinion piece on that a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a><p>A more common problem than SAT not being fast enough is the reduction being intractable. It's ok if it's ""big"" (SAT solvers can solve for millions of variables), but it's easy for naive encodings to generate truly absurd blowups, gigabytes or more, which can make it intractable to even <i>state</i> the SAT problem, i.e. write it to disk or send it over a pipe. If you avoid that problem, the actual SAT-solving step is usually fast. I believe that's where some of the interest in alternatives to SAT comes from, as compilation targets, so to speak, that are easier to generate non-blown-up code for.<p>SAT-heritage grounding targets are still common in logic programming, though, e.g. <a href=""http://potassco.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://potassco.sourceforge.net/</a> uses a SAT-like approach, though one specialized for answer-set programming rather than directly targeting SAT.",1343913035

As for 30 Rock: The problem with English shows on German television is that they are all dubbed. I won't say that they are doing a bad job (c.f. eastern european countries) but sometimes they are missing out puns and jokes which ""can't be translated"" without losing meaning. In the end this can make a funny TV show unwatchable.
On the other hand you will never (as in never ever) see an undubbed show on German television. People are used to watch it in German, so most of them might just never watch it again in either language.<p>edit: s/Disclaimer/FYI/",1343912432

There's something to be said for having a task at hand and accomplishing a series of steps rather that lead to something rather than a mashup of useful tutorials and lectures (no-matter how brilliant they are), that don't have an underlying current, theme or curriculum to them.",1343912428

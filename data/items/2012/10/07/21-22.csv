I mean wtf, why doesn't v8 make this optimization?<p>There are three optimizations I see in the eval example:<p>1. The object is created as a literal rather than by property assignment (see <a href=""http://jsperf.com/object-literals-vs-object-properties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/object-literals-vs-object-properties</a>).<p>2. The for loop loop is unrolled.<p>3. The column names are cached in the function and do not have to be retrieved each time.<p>The reason these can't be done by v8 on its own is that they make assumptions that v8 can't guarantee. For the first two, you have to guarantee that the columns array is always the same length. For the first and last, you have to guarantee that the columns will always have the same names.<p>So even though you take a big hit on the initial eval of the function, you'll likely make up for it by having a better-optimized function.",1349646309

See: GIN, and here's an example:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4946888"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/4946888</a><p>This uses the same underlying indexing method often used with Full Text Search.<p>Values in arrays can be awkward if you are frequently pulling them out for joins, et al.  However, if you frequently are dealing with operators over the entire collection they are quite handy, and I have enjoyed using them for this purpose.<p>An example that parallels something I've recently done for Real Work:<p>Suppose you are writing a piece of software that aggregates some blogs of various vendors and twitter feeds.  You want to take a chunk of text (the contents of the post) and then be able to easily search for text that has a certain textual tag ascribed by their author.  Sometimes, one's requirements are nicely met if one puts tags into an array and writes queries like this:<p><pre><code>    SELECT contents FROM bucket_o_text WHERE tags && '{go,golang,gccgo}'\n</code></pre>\nThe ""&&"" is read ""overlaps"", so now you will get posts that seem to be about the programming language Go.  If you want to find things about both golang and erlang, one might say:<p><pre><code>    SELECT contents FROM bucket_o_text WHERE tags && '{go,golang,gccgo}'\n    AND tags @> '{erlang}';\n</code></pre>\nWhere ""@>"" is read ""contains"".  If you were confident the tags seem reasonably normalized, you might even write:<p><pre><code>    SELECT contents FROM bucket_o_text WHERE tags @> '{erlang,golang}';\n</code></pre>\nI would stop using this approach if I started having higher-order data about the tags 'erlang' and 'golang'.  Said another way, data about tags, or metadata on tags, which are themselves metadata of the post.  In this case I'd be inclined to break out 'erlang' and 'golang' into rows of a table so one could enumerate the concepts in the database easily and write constraints.",1349645959

I really appreciate the fact that Felix took the time to write it.  I learned a lot, and will definitely integrate this into my work whenever performance-critical code is involved.  Particularly since I enjoy dataviz so much.<p>I'm a little surprised that someone so into JavaScript is using R and ggplot2 to visualize his data, and not d3 along with CoffeeScript for munging data (or Python if you can't stand CoffeeScript).  Don't get me wrong, R is a powerful tool, but with d3 you can skip the whole ImageMagick/Skitch step since you're making visualizations directly for the web.  Plus, once you've grasped d3's declarative approach (took me a while), it's so easy to quickly make powerful visualizations with it.  In fact, it was partially inspired by ggplot2, if I'm not mistaken.<p>And to quickly munge/clean data, I've found CoffeeScript does very well here, similar to how easy it is to use Python for this task.  I wouldn't want to write out JavaScript when rapidly trying to get data in the right format for visualizations, but with CoffeeScript and a functionally-oriented library like underscore, it's pretty easy.<p>That said, I'm sure once you've mastered such an intricate tool as R, it's hard to give up that power.   But if you're a node devotee and you're looking for a good tool in JavaScript to visualize data, you can't get much better than d3.

The reason I still use Opera over Chrome is because of its excellent support for mouse gestures (the various mouse gesture extensions just aren't that responsive and smooth as Opera's native ones are).\nTo switch tabs I just hold the right mouse button and turn the scroll wheel. To open up a new tab I hold the right mouse button and move the mouse a few pixels down, it doesn't even have to be that precise. For moving back and forward in browser history, I do right button + left mouse button and left mouse button + right mouse button respectively.\nI wish OS's had native support for mouse gestures system-wide, I think they're widely under-utilized.",1349644217

Anyway, the big switch statement meant that the profiler output was useless for me, ""Parser#parse"" was all it told me about : (.<p>FWIW this is also a case of ""get better tools"".

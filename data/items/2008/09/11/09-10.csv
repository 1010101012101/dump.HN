301273,comment,300960,301249,0,0,staunch,,,"I agree it's a good idea to get something going while still employed. I disagree it's ""foolish"" not to though. I think the #1 cause of failure for most startups is never taking a plunge at any point. I know too many people who have dreams that remain dreams for so long they're eventually forgotten. It can be <i>really</i> hard to do a good job on a side project if you're the kind of person who tends work really intensely on one thing at a time.<p>Better to take the risk (if you can) and have a real shot at success than always be waiting until ""tomorrow"". He's forcing himself to succeed or fail. People are capable of a lot when they don't have an easy out. How many successful companies were side projects? Maybe 5-10%? That's a damn low number if you realize how many people have side projects they wish they had the balls to turn into companies.<p>My big concern is that $15k just isn't that much cash. Unless you're living somewhere ridiculously cheap or rent free (parents) that's probably just a few months. Not enough to get the profitability for almost anyone. YC companies only work because they get 3-4 months free, can spend their own money after that, and have a really good shot at getting funding.<p>Hats off to you, Palish. Good luck.",1221126980

Yammer sold its self as a communication tool while ididwork sold itself as a sort of Rescue Time/punch card/productivity tool.<p>In the end Yammer looks fun while ididwork looks scary.",1221126454
301268,comment,300920,300920,0,0,staunch,,,"Although I already had a computer I was taught to touch type ""properly"" on a typewriter. It really did take just a few weeks to get totally proficient and it's been handy ever since.<p>The only time I've managed to make a significant boost was when I bought a Das Keyboard. Not having any labels on my keys means I have learned to absolutely never peak at the keyboard. It's improved my speed overall, but especially with the number row.<p>I have known a lot of programmers who don't type fast. I don't think it's a massive impediment, but I do think there's a strong correlation between bad programming and lack of typing ability.<p>I don't think any of the people I personally know and consider uber programmers type really badly. Certainly could be though and I just haven't noticed.",1221126388
301267,comment,301261,301261,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"In many ways I find this article both interesting and scary.<p>The author suggests that Quinn Emmanuel are shaking up the legal practice, but their method seems like a corporate version of the ambulance chasers methodology.<p>A no win, no fee approach seems to make law both more accessible and less accessible at the same time. The problem is it moves the availability of lawyers from something based on need and cost, to something based on chances of winning. Winning a case doesn't necessarily imply the moral imperative.<p>That said since they are doing solely corporate law this is less of an issue with me, and I'm very happy to see someone disrupting the legal profession.<p>Like YC's free legal documents for A-funding this kind of thing is probably a step in the right direction to make the law more accessible to smaller companies.",1221126310

If your bottleneck in development is typing speed you're doing something terribly wrong.<p>If it's a ""lines of code"" contest, then sure, learn to type fast, but if it's about producing good concise code I don't think typing speed makes much difference. If you want to program enough, you'll naturally become fast enough.",1221123847

The net number of agricultural workers &#x27;producers&#x27; is rapidly declining due to higher yield &#x27;jobs&#x27; off farm. This impacts output/acre significantly.<p>However the ceiling for human resource in farming is pretty low.

Your last name reminded me of Racket when I saw it; not sure why though.<p>Kudos to your group, or just you personally, for recommending Chromium, and NOT Chrome.  I work for a university IT department, and our inventory confirms even after lecturing co-workers, I am the only one to have installed it on Windows laptops, or even Mac or Linux if you can believe the latter.  Mostly everyone has no idea you can download the FLOSS fork of Chrome without the nasty proprietary bits.  In the future, it would be cool to see you guys package a more focused IDE with the rage, node-webkit or nw.js or whatever is called now.  You guys seem like a great example of a lang that could shine here, much like Dr. Racket is a pretty wonderful example of the robustness of Racket (although I still prefer Geiser myself).<p>I also see shriramkmurthi talks about university requirements about minimal install and configuration overhead.  This is a great, if not just good, thing.  Again, as a university IT guy thank you.  However, I still have mixed feelings.<p>I worked for kids in a very spoiled institution with expensive new laptops, complete with full admin control for students.  I get my fair share of novice programmers install a full Stata stack for the econometrics class, and along with professors, hose a 4GB or 8GB RAM laptop which &quot;needs more drive space and RAM because my 1GB CSV dataset is so big.&quot;  We tell them to write tighter code and they are incensed (seriously had students demand a more expensive version because one version of Stata had an arbitrary limit of variables in a given program, IIRC correctly, and the group of students and professors were told to us less variables, less than 60,000! I cannot imagine production distributed systems code needing that many, haha).<p>So, I bring up that last anecdote as a warning.  I would love to help any way I can.  Damned with compiled binary LLVM and Java toolchains that need admin privs and 10GB of space for library source and various dependencies, also damned with in-browser JS bootstrapped compilers that sit on an increasingly over-generalized OS in an OS.<p>How do you plan to handle the abstractions moving further and further away from the metal?  I assume this is to teach programming basics only, right?  Like Racket is, kind of?  Do you worry about pushing this farther down into systems programming, or are you staying focused?

According to one source, in Q1 2013, they made up as much as 25% of sales in certain Northern California markets[1].<p>> The problem is that by not putting a home on the open market, the seller never finds out how much it&#x27;s really worth.<p>You are making a couple of major assumptions:<p>1. Optimizing for price is best accomplished by maximizing the number of potential buyers.<p>2. Optimizing for price is the primary/only motivation of a seller, and outweighs all other considerations, such as speed, privacy and risk.<p>Neither is always true, especially at the high end of the market. A good agent is going to understand his or her seller&#x27;s needs and employ a strategy that makes the most sense, and it&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s responsibility to decide whether the agent&#x27;s recommended approach is acceptable.

And the idea that we could ruin 20-30% of the farmland in the world and still recover is very encouraging, because you can make up for that kind of loss by simply increasing the number of farmers and production would go up more than enough to make up for it.<p>Also even once land is &quot;ruined&quot; it&#x27;s still not ruined forever.  It just takes some years of rest and rehabilitation before it is fertile again.  You can grow peanuts to fix nitrogen.  You can plant grass and graze cattle on it for several years to fix large amounts of biomass into the land and kickstart the process of renewal.<p>Medieval farmers knew about this and they had a &quot;two field&quot; system where they farmed one field and left the other fallow.  Eventually they figured out that 50% rest wasn&#x27;t strictly necessary and went to the three field system where a field got 33% rest.  Right now most farmland gets 0% rest which is part of the problem.<p>Lets suppose that there are diminishing returns to adding farmers.  Eventually you run into the limits of sunlight of course.  But if most farmland is only 10% efficient and lets say that quadrupling the number of farmers per acre only triples production.  By teaching people to be farmers and to manage their land very jealously we could have well over half the fields in recovery all the time and still have enough food.",1427312097
9265366,comment,9263943,9264872,0,0,pfultz2,,,"> If we had something similar for C and/or C++ before boost was developed, I&#x27;d bet we had a SerialPort lib, independent, portable, efficient, focused and well tested, and BoostAsio would just depend on it, instead of developing inside that logic.<p>That&#x27;s backwards. A SerialPort library would depend on Asio since it defines sync and async streams and the utilities built around that. It seems bad design for a SerialPort library to reimplement those basic utilities.<p>A dependency manager allows for finer modularity. So instead, Asio could be split into multiple libraries: Asio.Core, Asio.Serial, Asio.Network, etc. Its ok we have to bring in two smaller libraries instead of one large libary, since we have a dependency manager to handle this for us.<p>Also, a lack of a dependency manager in C++ has lead to developing of large monolithic libraries. So instead of managing dependencies, the library gives you everything plus the kitchen sink, so the user won&#x27;t need to use another library. Of course, this is not scalable.<p>The other side-effect from a lack of a dependency manager in C++ is the developing of unnecessary header-only libraries(like Boost.Signals2). This just slows down compilation.<p>A real viable dependency manager in C++ will be a game changer, and recently. there is a lots of serious talk about it. In fact, there are like 3 difference talks that are directly related to dependency managing at C++Now 2015.",1427312094

C++ was arguably as bad as the article said... then.<p>I&#x27;d say that C++ being fixed and becoming more popular took place in parallel.  As it got used more, people saw more things that needed fixed, and as more things got fixed, it became more useful for more people.<p>Why did things get fixed nearly as fast as they got identified as problems?  Because there was an arms race between Borland and Microsoft to have the best C++ compiler, primarily.

In particular, if it somehow encrypts something wrong, then anyone who tries to decrypt it without AES-NI wouldn&#x27;t be able to do so.<p>Then there&#x27;d be a public outcry and Intel would have to recall millions and millions of processors (see Pentium floating point bug) with massive cost to them.<p>So, the only way it could be bad would be if the instructions could somehow leak data to other contexts or devices. This is possible, but is probably not how you&#x27;d perform such an attack, and if Intel did that knowingly, you&#x27;ve probably got bigger problems.<p>tl;dr - It&#x27;s hard to trust random data and very easy to break Intel&#x27;s hardware random number generator (couple of transistors), so don&#x27;t give it importance above current methods because you have no way to verify that it&#x27;s working as advertised.

9265199,comment,9264192,9264192,0,0,hashberry,,,"Here is the Abstract from the actual study:<p>Obesity is an emerging health crisis in many developing countries. To find food based solutions for obesity, rice resistant starch (RS) concentrations and novel ways to increase RS concentrations were studied. A total of 38 Sri Lankan rice varieties were tested; the RS concentrations ranged from 0.30 to 4.65%. The traditional rice varieties had significantly higher RS concentrations than old and improved varieties. Bg 305 had the least RS concentration out of all. However, applying different heating and cooling conditions with pure coconut oil showed RS concentrations increased by at least 10 times. The increase in RS content could be attributed to the increase in RS3 and RS5 types, suggesting potential to increase these types of RS in rice. This study results clearly show that rice, when cooked properly, could be a good low calorie food source for obesity reduction. In-vivo glycemic effects of RS studies are in progress.<p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2015-03-low-calorie-rice-obesity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2015-03-low-calorie-rice-obesity.html</a>",1427310350

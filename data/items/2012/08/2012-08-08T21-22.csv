Considering about half of your original article was strictly discussing Norton's coverage, I can see where he got that idea. Then your original piece includes this bit:<p><pre><code>    > It isn't clear why Norton felt it wasn't necessary to 
    > publish any dissenting voices. From her public Tweets, 
    > it is however, quite clear that Norton has no love for

</code></pre>
That's an attack on the author, don't you think? You just implied she neglected to include any criticism of the tool because she hates the crypto community. Not only does this illustrate your lack of understanding the concept of privilege, but it's rude and unnecessary, so I don't blame Ryan for taking offense.<p>For starters, Quinn wasn't trying to bury facts the paragraph about how Cryptocat is an experiment is directly above the screenshot of the app, so it's fairly noticeable.<p>Second, your section titled ""On the issue of privilege"" <i>doesn't actually talk about privilege.</i> It talks about how two white men were stopped at the border to the US and one who had some of his devices seized. Her tweet was stating that maybe tools made by white men in first-world countries might not be able to adequately address the needs of less fortunate individuals under oppressive regimes.<p>So sure, it's great to call out projects that seem Too Good To Be True, but multiple times you drew attention to Quinn's specific article, and even once needlessly quoted a few of her tweets. I don't see that attention paid to any other reporter, so Ryan's rebuttal is mostly on point.",1344463184

And these L-stable distributions don't generally have a finite variance and sometimes don't have a finite mean [2].<p>And it is fairly easy to see how a market tends to not be Gaussian; change based on a Gaussian distribution tends to be random walk a la Brownian motion, where the final position of a variable is the sum of many small changes in the variable. Non-Gaussian, infinite-variance-distribution-based movement on the other hand has the property that the final result of a variable tends to be more the result of a finite number of large changes rather than a lot of small changes. And this is what the stock market often looks like. A few wild moves often impact things as much as the incremental changes. The apparent mean, variance and distribution of stocks on a day-to-day basis may not pan out in extreme situations and these can eat away the rest of your profits. If the stocks that seemed independently in normal conditions all go down in crash, your estimated-correlation-based-diversification hasn't protected you very well.<p>The Black Swan is a sadly too-simplified popular summary of these points.[3] It does point to the general idea. The higher-level take-away is that infinite variance distributions exist and indeed, you can not apriori assume a given distribution you are working with isn't one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=6KGSYANlwHAC&lpg=PP1&ots=yULs5p13Uo&dq=Benoit%20Mandelbrot%20fractal%20and%20scaling%20in%20finance&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=Benoit%20Mandelbrot%20fractal%20and%20scaling%20in%20finance&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=6KGSYANlwHAC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a>

It's moving in a direction spreadsheets haven't gone before, and in order to innovate that way they've made some decisions about which classical features to defer. How could they have done otherwise?<p>The research literature on spreadsheet users shows that about half of them rely on computation with formulas and half don't. (That data is old and spotty but it's the best we have. Joel Spolsky made a similar point a few months ago.) So a sizeable chunk of spreadsheet users aren't going to mind, or even notice, that computation wasn't prioritized here.

Every VC on the planet has a long list of ""the next big thing"" that never went anywhere. I don't necessarily care if some of the ""smartest"" people in tech are backing it. App.net has raised under $300,000 -- if it was THAT awesome, they would have raised the full $500K almost instantly. Fred Wilson would have just just wrote a check for the whole thing. They might like the idea, but if there was a viable business model there would have been a frenzy if the proposed product was that awesome. I still can't understand how this is supposed to make money. And giving someone a $50 or $100 or $1000 pledge on Kickstarter is pocket change for tech luminaries. They're likely supporting the founders more than a specific implementation. I don't know many people actually salivating over this or else they wouldn't be needing Kickstarter.<p>More power to the founders, I'm just skeptical because it still isn't clear what this project is supposed to accomplish. It's almost like Occupy got involved in a software project to vent anger over the big companies acting in ways with which they disagree.<p>Still, good luck to the App.net team.

Combine this with the electronics-unfriendly environment, and you probably aren't going to be strapping huge DLSR's on a 2.5 billion dollar science machine.<p>Edit: Also, these appear to be the navigation cameras, so they're probably just good enough to be able to point the rover in a direction free of road hazards and tell it to boldly go where no other machine has yet gotten around to going.",1344459865

In terms of exposure to the crew, the actual magnetic field experienced within the cabin would probably not be that high (since the magnet itself would likely be on an external boom).<p>As far as bulk material launch, I don't think there's a ton of value in launching unprocessed raw materials into orbit. There's only a narrow time window where that's actually useful, because once you have built up even a moderate off-Earth industrial base then it becomes easy to produce things like bulk metals and whatnot.

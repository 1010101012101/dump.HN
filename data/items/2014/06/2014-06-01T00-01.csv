There are simply too many poor people overseas that are willing to take lower wages and out-compete domestic workers.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see someone with economic credentials who agrees with me.  Which end of the either-or proposition should we take?  That depends largely on your politics.<p>I think global free trade would be a nice thing in the happy imaginary world where having a seat in the UN means your country always puts the interests of the whole of humanity above your own.  But the simple and obvious reality is that most countries look out for themselves first, and so if we make policies and choices based on our happy imaginary world instead of the darker (or at least greyer) real world where we actually live, we&#x27;re going to be quite sorry about some of those choices sooner or later.",1401584266

That would mean that on a market based evaluation, for a person who makes a bad enough nurse, the availability of the cup &quot;improvement&quot; would have to be detrimental to measuring-cup users in order for the market to value the person as a nurse above them as a measuring-cup inventor.<p>As you note there&#x27;s a big problem with working out how the market values the item in the first place. Just because something costs more doens&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better value, of course. In a way if the cup costs less than the traditional measuring-cup it&#x27;s a better product; in another way if it costs more but the same number buy it then it&#x27;s a better product. You have to make a cost-benefit judgement.<p>If people say they wouldn&#x27;t buy a new angled measuring-cup just for the USP, but that they would replace a broken traditional cup with the new style one, how then do you establish the value?

7827691,comment,7826338,7826338,3,0,ilaksh,,,"It is not difficult to come up with new business ideas or ways to improve on businesses that already exist.<p>(As a side point, you don&#x27;t really need to come up with new ideas or even make an improvement, you can just enter an existing market and be successful at selling.)<p>I come up with new business ideas probably once a week.  Maybe several in a day.<p>It is orders of magnitude more difficult to actually effectively execute a business idea.  And also often extremely difficult to successfully market it.<p>The reason it is relatively easy to come up with a new idea: you just need to make a loose identification of a product or solution.  To actually implement it, you have to fill in all of the details and refine them.  A simple concept can encapsulate a huge amount of complexity and engineering work.   For example, the OXO cup.  Once you have that idea, you need to work out exactly what design to use and where to place the measurement labels.  Then you need some kind of manufacturing.  Manufacturing a product can be very complex.  You need distribution.<p>And then you need marketing.  There are many reasons that marketing hard.  For one thing, people are bombarded with products.  There are so many new options that people have built up a tolerance for amazingness.  Even if your product is absolutely incredible it may not break through into someone&#x27;s consciousness for more than a moment.  Also, people are busy and they have a limited capacity for learning new things.  Even if your product makes things much easier, it is still a new thing for that person to learn, so they have to make an investment of their time and effort.  And unfortunately with status quo bias there is a tendency for everyone to undervalue innovative ideas.  And for your product to really become popular then you need to access network effects, i.e. move the entire herd.",1401580926
7827689,comment,7827408,7827639,5,0,jonnybgood,,,"> As an anecdote, a few weeks ago, a very good Indian friend of mine started work at a hot SF startup (their backend is in Go!). In her second week, she was asked not to heat up her food in the microwave because her food &#x27;smelled&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s a hard one. I personally don&#x27;t see that as a cultural issue. Startups are usually within small quarters. Big Co&#x27;s typically have isolated &quot;kitchen areas&quot;. I think it&#x27;s important when working in small quarters organizations to be respectful of the workplace and sensibilities of your coworkers. It&#x27;s somewhat analogous to BO when someone refuses to wear deodorant or the likes because of their convictions. Unlike noise that can be drowned out with headphones, you can&#x27;t really drown out smells.",1401580884

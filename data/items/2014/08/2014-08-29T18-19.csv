I&#x27;m both a landlord and a tenant.<p>>Any day, for any reason or no reason, your entire life can be turned upside down. You can be effectively made homeless and given a very limited amount of time to find a similar alternative place to live that may or may not exist and may or may no be close to your work (which matters when you&#x27;re poor and cannot afford public transport).<p>Sure, that would be inconvenient, but I&#x27;d get a reasonable amount of notice (60 days in any case where I haven&#x27;t done anything wrong) which would be sufficient for me to line something else up.<p>>I&#x27;m not referring to rent control: I am talking about privacy of the tenant (inspection notification periods, etc), notice for evictions (e.g. 30 days)<p>Oh, so we&#x27;re actually in agreement.

8243963,comment,8243640,8243733,2,0,curun1r,,,"Rent control was an attempt to correct for an even worse government policy. If we repeal both CA prop 13, which freezes property taxes at a certain value when the property is sold, we can repeal rent control as well. But both need to happen. And both are excellent examples of the &quot;I&#x27;ve got mine, f#@K everyone who doesn&#x27;t have theirs&quot; thinking that&#x27;s so pervasive in California.<p>If California were serious about fixing it&#x27;s housing problems, it would:<p>1) Repeal prop 13. Yes, some grannies would be forced to sell their homes because their property taxes would go up beyond their ability to pay from their fixed income, but the overall effect would be positive. A side benefit of this would be that we could fund our schools again.<p>2) Cities could repeal rent control laws. If owners are forced to pay property taxes that reflect the true value, there&#x27;s less likely to be an imbalance between the value they get from renting and from selling the property.<p>3) Cities should allow the building of more housing regardless of complaints of existing residents. Repealing prop 13 will also help with this, since there will no longer be a direct financial benefit to existing homeowners to block new construction at all costs. But the underlying problem that&#x27;s evicting poor people from ares like San Francisco is that there&#x27;s a severe imbalance between housing supply and demand. No amount of government meddling will fix that problem...the only thing that will is correcting that imbalance by increasing the supply of housing.",1409338666

8243921,comment,8243640,8243821,4,0,jcrites,,,"Plenty of properties will advertise &quot;no pets&quot;, but you can negotiate with the landlord about that. For example, you might offer an additional deposit against pet damage, or offer to pay a cleaning fee when you leave. I have pets and I have always been able to talk landlords out of their &quot;no pets&quot; policy.<p>If you offered the landlord double the lease price in exchange for a 2 year contract, will they take it? Almost certainly. Few contracts of that type are truly take it or leave it. My point is not that 2x would be fair, just that you have the ability to negotiate, which means the question of whether you can get a contract with the terms you want depends on your ability to negotiate a price for those terms.<p>Many landlords value stability and will be happy with a longer term lease at the same price, or even a lower price. And that&#x27;s where the negotiation comes in. If the landlord believes prices in the area will rise steadily, then he may or may not want to offer a fixed price over a 3 year lease. Perhaps he will offer a longer lease, but with a stipulation of 3% price increase per year. You don&#x27;t believe prices will rise that much, so you counter with 1% YoY. It&#x27;s like buying a housing future. You&#x27;re locking in the price of housing now as insurance against it changing in the future. That should properly have a different price than a lease with no such provision.<p>If a person believed in rent control, why not go further? Fix the price of property itself so that it may not rise more than 1% per year. If you buy a house from someone, the sale price may not be greater than the last sale price increased by 1% YoY. Would this be desirable? A law like this will have all sorts of negative consequences on the economy. For example, imagine a house owner who no longer wishes to live in the city. If prices were allowed to rise, then he&#x27;s incentivized to sell his house, cash out on the increased price, and move somewhere else, enabling a person who wants to live in the city can do so. But if prices are not allowed to rise, then he&#x27;s stuck selling is house for the same price he bought it; he has no incentive to move. Someone is willing to pay him much more for that house, but they can&#x27;t. This is what it means for resources to be allocated efficiently, and it depends on the ability of prices to change over time.<p>Fixing prices also affects investment. For example, if I believed that prices were likely to rise in some area, then I&#x27;m incentivized to buy property there, build housing or fix it up, and sell or rent it to capitalize on that price increase. The rising prices bring investment: I might build an apartment building to take advantage of rising rents. By comparison, if I know that my property will be rent controlled, then that limits my financial upside from investment, and removes my incentive to invest, which is also bad for the economy if it would otherwise happen naturally.",1409338328

There might be a lot less magic going on in terms of getting data binding to work, but it&#x27;s something javascript devs should understand anyways (loose coupling using custom events). I think the detriment comes more from newer companies looking to hire front end folks who have experience with modern frameworks such as angular, ember, and react.

I get the impression he is not aware of Fahy&#x27;s approach at all.  It probably is not used in his specialty.<p>HOV is using extremely high concentrations of solutes to reduce the freezing point (a colligative property).  That is the only way to vitrify something big like the brain.  At least, until some super material is invented that lets us pull out lots of heat really fast.  The trouble is that it is toxic to cells to be exposed for very long.  With rabbit kidneys and small slices of brain tissue, the exposure time at warm temperatures can be very brief.  So with current cryonics we can only make a morphological argument for information theoretic preservation.<p>With better materials that enable faster cooling, prevent the toxicity mechanisms of the cryoprotectant, and/or block ice formation non-colligatively (certain polymers do this), it is theoretically possible that we could get to a point where the cells are still viable.  In that event, it would be like placing the brain in an &quot;off state&quot;.  You wouldn&#x27;t be able to resume it again without a body to implant it in, but that&#x27;s more likely to be on the 200-year radar than nanorepair, so the chances would be improved quite a bit.

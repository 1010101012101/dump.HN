Their lack of skill (and presumably cash, too) prevents them from gaining traction with Google Adwords and/or equivalent(s).<p>This leaves public marketplaces such as eBay, Amazon, Overstock, Etsy, etc.<p>eBay and Etsy sound like the best options. Etsy will be good because of its focus on small, handcrafty items. eBay will be good because of the sheer size of its user base. I don't have any experience with Etsy, but I'm assuming it is similar to eBay in many ways. The key to success with eBay is to not just pick what you want to sell and list it and hope for the best. Instead you need to spend time analyzing how other people are selling identical and similar items. What are they titling them? When are they scheduling the auctions? Are they bundling multiple items? How long are their auctions? Fixed price? eBay store?<p>Analyze the hell out of your competition, and experiment. You can use one of the bulk listing and schedule management tools like Turbo Lister, but you'll likely want to record information in Excel (or equivalent) and start parsing what's going on. The improvement yielded by careful analysis and experimentation over simply listing what you want to sell is tremendous. The people who succeed on eBay by selling a lot of items have optimized their strategy based on detailed research. They don't simply use custom html templates for their auctions, and diligently respond to customer inquiries. They analyze everything to death and adjust their methods based on what they learn from their extensive analysis.",1230933131

Denmark has a small homogeneous well educated population.  I would expect that the parents take an intense interest in their children's education resulting in high achievement.  In contrast in California we have a much more diverse population with a large  proportion of recent immigrants.  The parents are not well educated themselves and the kids are struggling because of poor English.  This makes it difficult to have a high achieving school system.

Where I'm at, the township schools that surround the cities public schools are dramatically better. The people that live in these areas as a whole have more money and more time to commit to their childrens education, and they value education more.<p>Clearly, the issue is more complicated than choice, but choice is a step in the right direction. But if we are to do choice, we much also do vouchers, so that the public tax money can go to public schools or to private schools. This process will eliminate the teacher union qualms stated by the article naturally, as people filter into private schools or functional public schools.<p>The best schools will be more competitive, yes. How is this any different than the rest of life? We use merit based systems for university and graduate schools, and on some level for job placement. Why would it not work in lower levels? I maintain that with choice, and vouchers, more private schools would pop up to cater to the excess supply of fantastic students, if such a surplus exists.<p>The real problem with this whole equation, just like in healthcare and other government services is the problem of the extreme low class.

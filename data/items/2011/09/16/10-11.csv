3003973,comment,3001783,3003187,5,0,bmj,,,"I agree (mostly), and while it's important for me to ""be around"" (my office hours are very similar to the author's), my kids spend a good chunk of their time playing with one another and with other kids.  I like to be around, because sometimes they say ""hey dad, let's play _something_,"" but mostly my wife and I stay out of the way.<p>There's a fine line, however, between being a good parent who doesn't hover and ""arrange"" their kids' lives to death, and a parent who is literally never around to see their kids.  The whole ""arrangement"" thing also goes for parents who schedule every minute of their kids' days so they don't have to be around the house.<p>Personally, we enjoy spending time together as a family.  Most weekends in the summer and fall are spent rock climbing and camping.  We do, however, spend many of those days with others (and other families), so our kids are generally off in the woods doing what kids do.  But, we also spend a good bit of time together, and I think it's meaningful to have activities that _are_ family-centered every so often.<p>Another cultural shift you don't take into account is the growing fear we (in the U.S., at least) have that our kids are simply going to be whisked away while we aren't looking.  Many parents would never even consider allowing their kids (I'm thinking under ten years old) to wander around the neighbor, or simply walk over to a friend's house and see if they are around.<p>I do, however, think you bit too harsh on the idea of being a ""Good Parent.""  There's also a fine line between giving your kids enough rope (and freedom) and being the drunk who only yells at his kids to get him another beer (yes, that's a bit of an overstatement).  There are plenty of nights when I come home from work, we eat dinner as a family, and then my kids disappear to play.  I won't see them again 'til bedtime.  But I feel as a parent, I need to be available for them when they want me, too.",1316170749

3003955,comment,3003470,3003747,6,0,potatolicious,,,"But it does. Or at least, it does in every way that we've yet to imagine.<p>What the author of the article suggests would be not ""anti-programmer"" are <i>necessarily</i> ""anti-user"". Breaking everything down into composable components and forcing the user to compose even simple, everyday procedures before being able to use them? How terribly difficult and exclusive to techies only!<p>Similarly, he suggests that the only way for meaningful interaction to occur between programs is through the unfettered access to a filesystem - as users have demonstrated time and time again the past decade or so, they don't <i>want</i> that. They will pile heir music and photos and movies happily into one big dump so long as a much more proficient application handles the intricacies for them. They don't <i>want</i> a filesystem - it's a toy for people like us.<p>The ability of an OS to expose data for manipulation does not <i>necessarily</i> preclude it from being user friendly, but that's only true in a very ephemeral, theoretical way. The <i>only ways we know how</i> to expose said data, up till now, is <i>entirely</i> anti-user, and part of why the popularity of computers with the general population has not exploded until so late. For too long <i>we've</i> kept the keys to the kingdom, and you know what, fuck all of that noise.<p>And the claim that iOS (and other similarly restrictive OSes) have been developed <i>primarily</i> to protect the company's interest is patently absurd. The iPhone has been <i>by far</i> the best thing to happen to mainstream computer users in the past two decades. They have power at their fingertips that they can actually comprehend now, and use without navigating a tome of quickly outdated knowledge. This is the age of the device you don't have to take a class to use! The empowerment here is incredible, and people have been throwing <i>gobs</i> of money at Apple, Google, and everyone else who has realized this. The main reason these OSes are restrictive is because it guarantees usability and consistency in a way that completely open platforms do not (Gimp, anyone?).<p>This whole article, and resulting thread, really disappoints me. I'd have thought that what we've seen in the last 4-5 years would <i>finally</i> wake up the tech community and make them realize that computational resources are pointless unless it benefits the rest of humanity somehow, and chief among these is mainstream usability. But no, it looks like a large contingent of HN is happy to view users as stupid plebes - if only they knew the value of free OSes and would take the time to learn the command line!<p>Screw that train of thought, and damn the people who continue to reinforce the false assumption that technology need be complicated and obtuse. I'm sick and tired of looking at all the cool things we can do - things that are of real benefit to people - and having it locked away behind a glass wall of techno-wizardry when it does so much more good out in the hands of the masses.",1316170125

A few months further on, I want to read it again and do some annotations, but I need another app for that. Well tough luck, i cannot open the pdf in the other app, since the pdf is tied to iBooks. If i'm lucky, maybe i'll remember i got it via a particular email, and resend it to the other reader.

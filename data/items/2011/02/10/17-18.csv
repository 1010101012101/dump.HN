If that's not what you meant then I'm sorry for reading too much into it.<p>> And they did not do this<p>Which I feel more inclined to agree with rather than claiming they failed because they didn't meet the highest level of security. However, a compromise doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't do enough - as TJX would be happy to tell you. Compromises happen, if they didn't we wouldn't be in business.<p>> Of course. It does not follow that breaking into the web server should compromise the mail server, or vice-versa. You're really losing me there.<p>It depends - it's not clear whether or not these are the same server. As well as this what's important is that someone somewhere in HBGary considered the possibility of getting hacked as part of a process to determine what countermeasures they should look to put in place.<p>It might not have been a small amount of money, they might have saved a lot or nothing. Having mail servers compromised is embarrassing but shouldn't be the end of the world - because anything that would cause real pain you would have to expect countermeasures for. Where this gets interesting is that with some of the documents Mr. Barr has not considered the possibility that his account might get hacked. If you don't consider your defences compromised to begin with, you're likely to compromise on your defences. The issue isn't 4 Gig of mail has been leaked, the issue is more to do with whether or not anything sensitve should've been encrypted. Of course, we're all only human and make mistakes, but dealing with this will be part of paying for them.<p>> I bet I could find a company that could set up an email server that couldn't be compromised just because the web server was compromised.<p>I've no doubt you could find someone who'd claim that they could do it, but it's all going to depend on the architecture, configuration, software and maintenance involved. FWIW I don't believe that HBGary used a company for their mail, I read somewhere that Aaron Barr was the administrator - perhaps that was an oversight on HBGary's part given comments about his personality by other staff members.",1297360720

2202886,comment,2202170,2202170,0,0,danilocampos,,,"(Disclaimer: I gave up on Quora months ago – maybe they've fixed these things)<p>I desperately wish I could effectively convey how bad I think Quora's implementation is. I'll try now. The visual design is simple, if bland, but that's not my beef. Simple is usually good.<p>I think it mostly hinges around discovery and sense of place. On Quora, it never feels like you <i>are</i> anywhere. No sense of hierarchy, no sense of order. Quora is a massive sense of limbo. It's really weird.<p>More than that, because of the myriad subjects under discussion, and the wholly opaque mechanisms for discovering them, it constantly feels as though there are places in Quora you're shut out of, without a clear path to get there. So, I don't feel like I'm anywhere, while it feels like there are elsewheres I <i>could</i> be. It's too clever by half, trying to intelligently curate what a given user will want to see, but ending up leaving the user in a state of helplessness.<p>There's also this bizarre conception of having to follow a topic in order consume it. Commitment before preview? Really? At least I think that's how it works. I mean, it's too confusing, too complicated for how simple the problem is.<p>Contrast this with Convore, which gives you:<p>- Discussions your friends have joined\n- Bigass list of all discussions\n- Discussions by category\n- Discussion search<p>Quora has the benefit of founders with a solid network, so the early adopters are heavy hitters with interesting things to say. It's a shame, then, that the user experience is just so... tepid.",1297360513

Right now the military is facing major disruption to its economic interests as long as the protests continue.  But if they transition to a new government, they can reduce the disruption.<p>Now I can just see you saying, <i>Economic interests?  What economic interests.  They are a military!</i>  Which is entirely reasonable, but wrong.  The Egyptian military is somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of Egypt's economy.<p>Why?  Well when the Camp David accords brought about peace, Egypt no longer needed such a big military.  But they didn't want to make all of those men go into the private sector at once, that could destabilize the country.  So they found jobs for them.  For example lots of wonderful beaches no longer needed to be filled with military bases to repel a possible Israeli attack, so the military removed the bases, and built tourist resorts instead.  Which they ran.<p>So Mubarak is out.  He can't protect the military's commercial interests.  Whoever and whatever replaces him is fine as long as the military interests are maintained.  The changes can be extensive, so long as the country goes back to work and the military is free to return to making money.",1297360267

2202704,story,,,2,0,jackmc,"Ask HN:  Free Office Space for Startups in Austin.  Good idea or not?",,"We came across a building that would be a great place for 40 or 50 early stage startups to hang their hat for, let’s say, 6 month stints at a time (we’re founders ourselves out looking for our own space).  It’s in a part of Austin that you’d want to be in if you’re new to the city and young.  The deal would be no strings attached…no rent…no equity…nothing.    Why?  Well, we love the feel of University Ave., Castro St. and SOMA just as much as the next guy, but we think Austin has a real unique vibe of its own and is a real, viable startup alternative to those other great locales…and we’re thinking maybe folks just need a little nudge to get here.  How?  We’d solicit some local funding…no VCs, attorneys, etc.  When?  Soon.<p>Maybe some folks would look at it as a poor man’s version of Y Combinator, TechStars, LaunchPad, Capital Factory, i/o Ventures or Dogpatch Labs.  But we look at it more as a “put-your-nose-to-the-grindstone” and “just-get-it-done” kind of opportunity…a way to help you bootstrap as long as you can (we’re bootstrappers ourselves).  Yes, it would come without the built-in cachet, cash, services and/or mentorship that those other programs provide…but would share key benefits such as the camaraderie, the sharing of ideas, the sharing of referrals, and the overall community that would naturally form.  As we gain momentum, we believe could also attract key mentors, free services and maybe a little DIY cachet of our own.  Plus, we could hold events with VCs, attorneys, other successful founders, etc. (even if they start out as simple Friday beer get-togethers).<p>We believe we could pull the money together to put this in play in fairly short order (i.e., months)…maybe we’re delusional…but, in our minds at least, the actual cost is just not that much as compared to the overall benefit to Austin where even only a handful of startups actually succeed, grow and stick around in some form or fashion over the next several years.  Maybe you come here, gain some traction, attract funding, and move on out to SV…but maybe you don’t.  And that’s where we think Austin benefits long term.<p>So, here are our back-of-the-napkin thoughts, plans and questions:<p>•       Entry would be on a rolling basis when space is available…so no Summer or Winter sessions…or anything like that.  No need for that in our mind.<p>•	We think 6 months is a good term, but what do you think?  Perhaps an additional 3 month option?<p>•	1 to 4 founders per startup…very early stage.<p>•	Rent and connectivity would be free.  Thoughts on the cost of good connectivity for 150 people?<p>•	Furniture is up to you; or maybe we’d seed it by buying a few hundred basic tables and chairs at Sam’s Club or Costco?  Maybe a few hundred whiteboards as well?<p>•	Both private offices and open space available on a first-come-first-serve basis.  Probably won’t have cash to reconfigure the space.<p>•	We would solicit a few key sponsors, but would avoid any startup-type service providers (e.g., VCs, law firms, PR firms, etc.) so that any and all of those types of service providers would feel equally welcome, and be on an equal footing, in coming around to mingle, present, advise, listen, etc.  No one would have an “angle” in…totally open to all.<p>•	We would like the vast majority of startups to come from other parts of the country/world (we say world, but thinking there might be Visa issues?).  Definitely want some Austin flavor, but would like this to be a melting pot of sorts as well.<p>•	Our startup would pay for its own space…we have no dog in this hunt…other than putting a deal together that might help our founder brethren a bit…as well as Austin’s startup culture.  Plus, it would be fun.<p>So, any thoughts from you guys?  Do you see any blind spots we might have?  Anyone interested?  Know anyone who might be interested?  Any feedback would be much appreciated.  Trying to get the balls to put this together, and your feedback may make me see things clearer.  Thanks!",1297358265

2202665,comment,2202120,2202625,0,0,frisco,,,"Deep-brain stimulation is different than cortical microstimulation.  DBS is injected into the basal ganglia and excites an area of the brain that's effectively atrophied.  This can be done relatively safely for things like Parkinsons, even though it's definitely not your first choice of treatment.  It's still somewhat cooking the brain, however; in the cases where DBS is used that just doesn't outweigh the benefits.  Cortical stimulation into primary sensory cortex is a totally different animal, and tends to cause seizures much more frequently.  The brain is kind of wired to seize, when you look at it, and it's amazing it doesn't more often.  Also, you can't map receptive fields -- which specific areas of cortex correspond to what sensation in what part of the body -- if your patient is an amputee, and there's no ""master map"" that's precise enough since it varies between individuals widely.  Further, DBS is just designed to grossly ""drive"" an area of the brain; in ICMS you'd want to precisely excite a few cells to create a sensation.  ICMS in practice just floods its surroundings with current in a rather blunt way.  Optogenetics are a solution but have their own problems (i.e., requires genetic transfection) that make them unacceptable for use in humans today.<p><i>This part is easy, isn't it? People integrate tools into their body image innately and easily.</i><p>Yes -- but as a patient lives with a prosthetic full time, as opposed for a few hours at a time like in most monkey studies, the brain will adapt to the prosthetic and the neural representations shift.  You need to be able to deal with this and understand what that learning looks like, which we can sort of do right now, but no one's really done a long-term-continuously-living-with-a-prosthetic study.  You generally don't try to solve complete unknowns like that for the first time in humans.  Humans would be a poor platform, anyway, since you can't observe and record from them 24/7 in a controlled environment.",1297357895

In August 2005 I went to work for Automattic as the second full-timer (after Donncha, inventor of WPMU). That was before WordPress.com was announced. I am still working for Automattic.<p>Byrne, in his MT-centric worldview, fails to mention a man who contributed more to WP's success than MT's failures could. The name ""Matt"" only appears within ""Automattic"" and the name ""Mullenweg"" doesn't even show up until the comments.<p>Many have said it and I agree: WordPress is shitty software. Having written a significant percentage of the code in WordPress since version 2.0, I can proudly accept the blame for some of the shittiest parts of WordPress. I was responsible for the integration of the rich editor, the widgets system, the media library, and many other poorly-designed components I have since expunged from memory. I wrote this crap because Matt asked me to.<p>In wisdom or dumb luck, Matt saw that a feature that mostly works for most users next week is better than a perfect feature next year. He coded as much as he could, then he learned to delegate and trust others. Then, as far as I could tell from inside my coding cave, he shifted most of his attention from engineering and design to promotion and business. He brought Toni and Raanan into Automattic and that's when the switching campaign really took off.<p>From the early days to now, Matt has exploited every resource for the benefit of WordPress. Even now, non-WordPress Automattic projects help subsidize the core development of WordPress. I don't know how much money Matt has made but I know that everyone who makes a living with WordPress owes him some credit for feeding so much power back into the project.<p>Matt wasn't the only contributor to the success of WordPress. It would be impossible to cover them all; go look at the About page on wordpress.org to get a taste. But if you could use a time machine to kidnap one person off that list, you would do the most harm to WordPress by choosing Matt.<p>Byrne says in a comment that his piece is about WordPress, not Automattic. He works hard to avoid delving into personalities. But the story of WordPress can't be told without discussing Matt Mullenweg. If your goal is to ""see what lessons can be learned from WordPress so that others seeking to build a successful product can learn from it"" you really should be looking at the people and the work they did more than the project that they worked on.",1297357738

How can you compare two things that have so little in common? For one thing, you can't reduce BA/PM to this, and regardless of if #1 is true or not, the salary is not just based on skills. If having a good PM means that the project will be delivered on time and that it makes a big difference for the company, they might deserve more than the people who made the product. If the insights from a business analyst means that the product is exactly what the market wants, they might deserve more too.<p>It's very easy to imagine two products that require the same technical abilities but one being very well-defined and on-target, while the other misses the mark. The programmer's work in both cases would be the same. The work done by BA/PM makes the difference.

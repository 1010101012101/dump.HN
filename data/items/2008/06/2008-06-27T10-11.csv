No company should ever get to a 90% market share - that's not good for the public.",1214564015

229635,comment,229281,229504,0,0,streety,,,"Ignoring the question of whether these individuals are afraid to die is there actually anything wrong with that?  Identifying your fears and then working to combat and overcome them is commendable in my opinion.<p>I suppose you could argue that if you had 1000 years ahead of you the drive to do great things may be weakened.  Why start today when the tools available in the next century would make everything so much quicker.<p>Similarly, I know that, at least in the biological sciences, there is a frequent joke that for an area where a certain theory has held true for a number of years but where new technologies are revealing errors the retirement/death of the incumbent professors is often required before better theories get the consideration they deserve.  Knowledge comes at a price and sometimes a fresh start is needed.<p>These arguments are incredibly weak though.",1214563468

Even if they pour lot of $$$ into development, they don't have the experience and search data Google acquired during the years of their algorithms battling with search engine spammers.<p>At this point, it is practically impossible to catch up, so MSFT seems to try alternative approaches - the problem is that that is not any easier, and nobody showed anything substantial yet.",1214562015

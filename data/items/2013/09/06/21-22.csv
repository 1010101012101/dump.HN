6342873,comment,6342176,6342448,6,0,shawn-furyan,,,">To produce a given amount of electricity, burning coal will produce more CO2 than oil or natural gas<p>There are many factors that this statement fails to take into account. Perhaps most importantly, the efficiency at which that energy is turned into useful power to propel the vehicle. Further, this is speaking very broadly about these fuel sources, and so is not directly applicable to specific complex. A quick google search surfaced a DOE primer[1] on EVs that claims that they are both &quot;Energy Efficient&quot; since &quot;Electric vehicles convert about 5962% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheelsconventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 1721% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels.&quot; and &quot;Environmentally Friendly&quot; because &quot;EVs emit no tailpipe pollutants, although the power plant producing the electricity may emit them. Electricity from nuclear-, hydro-, solar-, or wind-powered plants causes no air pollutants.&quot; On the latter point, power plant technology is increasingly moving away from dirty coal generation processes in the developed world, so gas powered vehicles will be at an increasingly great disadvantage.<p>The EPA also uses a method for rating vehicle fuel efficiency of non-petrol burning vehicles called eMPG[2] (effective miles per gallon) that takes into account the energy potential of the ultimate fuel source/sources used by the vehicle and converts them to the MPG (miles per gallon of petrol) scale. Electric vehicles rule the top of the rated vehicles followed by a couple hybrids and deisel compacts. EVs tend to be ~2x more fuel efficient than similarly sized petrol vehicles when compared by this particular method.<p>Concerning the Model S in particular, the EPA rates it as the most fuel efficient large sedan at 95 eMPG. Speaking generally, the only car class (does not take into account trucks and SUVs) that is led in fuel efficiency according to the EPA is the Midsize Station Wagon class. It is led by the Prius Model V, and the class does not seem to have a pure EV option. Every other class is led in fuel efficiency by an EV.<p>Finally, according to the EPA&#x27;s Greenhouse Gas Emissions calculator, the 2013 Tesla model S generates a US average of 250 grams per mile driven of Greenhouse gas emissions compared to the average new car at 500 gpm[3]. So half as bad as the average new vehicle in terms of GHG emissions.<p>P.S. Sorry for the somewhat poorly structured nature of this comment.

A century ago, people wrote in classical Chinese, which is an entirely separate literary language. When you go to Shanghai or Chenzhou you see signs, books, advertisements, etc. written in Mandarin, not the local languages of Shanghainese or Dzao Min. There are some exceptions -- Cantonese and Yi come to mind -- but these are very specific historical exceptions.<p>I purposely chose Swedish from the Germanic language family to prove a point. When this topic ever does get brought up, people usually make the comparison to Latin and the romance languages in Europe, harkening back to a time when all written communication was in Latin, and the vulgar or Germanic languages were spoken only. But would you seriously claim that Latin was the written form of Old German? Or that the Latin literary culture of the time was inclusive and representative of Germanic cultural norms?<p>Many (most, depending on how you count) of the local and minority languages in China are only distantly related to Chinese, in the same way that Swedish and Portuguese are both Indo-European languages. What we call China was a culturally, ethnically, religiously, and especially linguistically diverse place when it was politically unified by Qin Shi Huang 2200 years ago. Many of those languages still exist today, in the same regions.

In Graham&#x27;s day it was Mutual Funds -- these days it&#x27;s Index Funds/ETF&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re interested in some grounding, humbling, & timeless reading on it, read stuff by the aforementioned, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Rev-ebook/dp/B000FC12C8/ref=tmm_kin_title_0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Rev-ebook/dp/...</a> (no referral).<p>It sounds like the only reason OP doesn&#x27;t want to invest is because of high-speed trading and tricky professional investors. But, Graham and Buffett both suggest, with a long enough runway, you aren&#x27;t even playing the same game as them. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you saved a couple bucks on a stock today and if some day trader profited off your millisecond slowness -- if you trust your own decision making skills, you&#x27;ll own the stock for years and will save gray hairs with their mantra &quot;I don&#x27;t know and I don&#x27;t care&quot; (as a response to the question, &quot;What happened in the stock market today?&quot;).",1378501487

For a thread that gets big (in participants or in scope), that tends to suck. A tree is a better representation.<p>A second problem with mailing lists is that unless you keep old messages, you generally have to go to some horrible web-based archive.<p>Why not use an NNTP server?

Targeting early adopters is not bad -- almost by definition, your first users will be early adopters.<p>The important question is: Is this something that can grow to include the larger population, or will it remain forever niche? If it's something that will eventually spread to the rest of the world, then living in the SF ""echo-chamber"" is actually a big advantage -- you get a clearer view of the future. This also one of the reasons why many innovations come out of universities -- they also have a ""future world"" aspect to them (for example, I was using the web in 1994, but ""regular"" people had never heard of it and had no use for it).<p>Unfortunately, answering that question is very difficult. Early cell phones provide a wonderful example of this -- the market predictions were off by orders of magnitude.",1198820384

But if you want the best possible advice re: birth control I&#x27;d suggest finding a better doctor.  :)<p>For your reference:  The issue with IUDs and fertility is PID (Pelvic Inflamatory Disase).  It was previously thought that having an IUD increased your risk of PID, but the latest research shows that the risk of PID is not associated with IUD use, but with IUD insertion.  If you do not have an STI at the time of insertion, you&#x27;re safe.  Some research has even shown that the Mirena will lower the long term risk of PID, and a large study from China just came out showing that long-term use of IUD does not impact fertility.<p>You seem primarily concerned not with PID, but the risk of perforation during insertion in roughly 1 in every 2,000 women.  Which, first off, is a pretty damn low rate, and compares favourably to the risks of other birth control options.  And second, while a perforation can be serious, even if not caught it should just heal on its own.  Worst case, it might require surgery, but it&#x27;s not going to cause long term fertility issues.<p>Everyone has the right to choose which risks they&#x27;re willing to take, to be sure.  But I think you may be grossly misinformed if you think that the Mirena and similar IUDs convey significant risks of infertility.  Don&#x27;t get one inserted without an STI test, and get a followup check to make sure there&#x27;s no perforation, and then there is no (repeat no) evidence of an increased rate of infertility.",1424051981

Let me tell you how many times I&#x27;ve used parallelepipeds, Cramer&#x27;s rule, or found eigenvalues via the quadratic formula in the 12 years since linear algebra (and a career in statistical signal processing and machine learning): zero, zero, and zero. Most things in college are important only to the extent that they&#x27;re gatekeepers for what&#x27;s really important. What hiddencost says is true, but very little of what you&#x27;re learning in class is relevant to those important and interesting things. Sorry: college sucks.",1424051974

I remember a particular instance, at the beginning of my first quarter at UCSD. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with his work and had never heard of him.

9054972,comment,9053759,9054700,0,0,dalke,,,"The article was clear that it isn&#x27;t so simple. &quot;“Ballooning administrative and capital costs, seldom related to the core mission of higher ed, far outpace instructional costs,” ... &quot;High-profile spending has turned into a higher-education arms race, with universities pouring money into buildings, technology, academic star power, and administrative costs. Trevithick stressed that he believes this is the most relevant point of all—that universities aren’t paying fair wages to adjuncts because they don’t want to, not because they can’t.&quot;<p>Suppose we do #1. The easy university response for increased demand is to continue to hire adjuncts below the 30 hours per week limit for Obamacare => no improvement in the adjunct situation.<p>How do you even go about doing #2? Put a law in place capping the maximum number of PhDs per school? Push for an increase in technical colleges, career colleges, and other colleges without the liberal arts degree or graduate courses? Does that mean a retired person interested in learning for the sake of learning, who wants access to the research culture and resources, might be denied entry to a PhD program for fear of taking an adjunct position in the future?<p>So why not #3: unionize, with union contracts which require a working wage and health care coverage? Collective bargaining is a perfectly reasonable free market mechanism. If 75% of the teachers are adjuncts, and in the middle of a term 95% of them strike over demonstrably poor treatment, then it will be hard for the university to get the scab workers to finish off the term.<p>Or #4: place a limit on how much can be spent on administrative overhead. <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2011/features/administrators_ate_my_tuition031641.php?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2...</a> (and others) point out that administrative costs have grown while academic costs have decreased, as a percentage of the budget.

Thanks.<p>This article looked like it was going to hit the sweet spot of stuff I&#x27;m curious about, but I found I was still left with questions. If you (or anyone) will indulge me... I&#x27;ll try and ask a question to help clarify matters.<p>I work at a University on legacy ERP system(s). During registration there are 800+ concurrent connections but normally it floats around 200. Most all of these connections are idle. As you pointed out, a db may not be io/context bound (still hazy on that one). At the end of the day I consider myself technically astute, but basically a crud business programmer. I understand ACID and transactions; threads and async, maybe not so much.<p>Where I&#x27;ve always thought async could provide benefit would be in the following scenario. Our apps make a large # of procedural db calls today. If after studying them I realize that many are independent (i.e. reads) and could be &#x27;batched&#x27; could that not provide a big performance/latency improvement? I.e. instead of the serial sequence of calls that happen now (even if a stored proc), async allows me to submit multiple sql calls. What I&#x27;m calling batch. In this ideal world, sqlalchemy would take care of the details (perhaps with some guidance directives as to whether ordering of results was important) and assemble the results.<p>Is this not a possible future &#x27;async&#x27; sqlalchemy with superior responsiveness? Don&#x27;t threads block on each sql request?",1424051698

As far as writing a program to extract primes from that number, how could you without including a prime test in the program?  You&#x27;d think Erdos and friends would have made it easier by bothering to encode word boundaries - say with a prefix free code[1]   :) - 01 for a word boundary, 00 for a true 0:<p>0.0120130150170111011301170119012301290131013701410143...

You could also put the ordinality of the prime number between 08...09 tags, then you could know exactly whether you&#x27;re looking at the millionth prime or the million and second one.<p>But yeah other than not encoding boundaries you are right, it&#x27;s quite akin to the real number you provided.

What&#x27;s remarkable is not just that such a constant <i>exists</i> - that will give you a prime for <i>any</i> n - but that there is a smallest such constant and we already know it:<p>1.3063778838630806904686144926...<p>I find that remarkable.  raise that to any 3^n and you get a prime and change.  wow.<p>EDIT2: Your argument also didn&#x27;t address one thing I&#x27;m curious about - why a similar number can&#x27;t exist for 2^n instead of 3^n...  thanks for any thoughts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code</a>",1424051206

The problem is that the links become ugly, unwieldy for the users to handle, and occasionally cause problems that are rather hard to debug. For example the base64 encoding I was using for the authentication token included &#x27;.&#x27; as a one of the characters. Well, turns out that the linkification code in gmail will ignore a &#x27;.&#x27; at the end of the link (which is kind of sensible). So 1/64 of my validation links ended up being invalid.<p>The supposed benefit of the scheme is that you don&#x27;t need to evolve your DB schema as you add or remove validation fields. That&#x27;s rubbish. If you&#x27;re happy with storing data with no schema in the links, you should be equally happy storing it without a schema in the DB.

If you own a single laptop you own 100% of the means of production, you do not NEED LP&#x27;s, VC&#x27;s, Angels, or a paycheck.  If you want to keep 100% of it, then go, code up your own damn site like any number of people here did, don&#x27;t take a dime from anyone and go produce some value and keep <i>all</i> of it.  There are basically zero costs involved with launching a web startup.  do it then.  you&#x27;re acting like this is the nineteenth century and you&#x27;re working in some factory owned by a VC.  <i>you</i> own the tools.  what exactly are you missing?  Go build something and put it up.  right now.  tonight.  go go go go go go.",1424048594

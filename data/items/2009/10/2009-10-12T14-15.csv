876798,comment,876674,876674,0,0,TrevorJ,,,"I have talked with a neurologist's office at length about brainwaves and the behavior associated with them. We all exhibit these wavelengths, but in different ratios depending on individual makeup/what we are doing.<p>Typically Alpha wave activity (8-12 mhz) is associated with creativity and calm alertness. According to the neurologist, certain relaxing activities can boost Alpha waves such as taking a walk or taking a hot shower.<p>The next bracket up is beta waves. the higher range of Beta is the stressful ""fight or flight mode"". If you are on your third cup of coffee and frantically trying to get something finished before an impending deadline, odds are that if somebody did a EEG on your brain you would see high levels of beta activity. Trouble is, this is where a lot of people live these days and we function in this mode as the norm, which becomes counter productive to creative thought.<p>My advice is to make sure you give yourself time to downshift into the calmer, more creative state as much as possible. Take a walk, take a shower. Practice slower, deeper breathing.",1255359072

876787,comment,876477,876477,0,0,1gor,,,"'Saving Wall street' was intended as 'saving the financial system'.<p>A collapse of several banks/insurance companies would trigger a run on the remaining banks, complete break-down of business lending, mass bankruptcies among non-financial companies, mass layoffs, civil unrest, sky-rocketing costs of servicing state debts, drop in foreign capital inflows, currency devaluation and likely default on government bonds leading to more misery. The crisis would be world-wide, affecting international trade and investment and well-being of billions. The costs of doing nothing would be enormous.<p>Markets is a complex nonlinear system that can go into a state of positive feedback -- trouble would breed more trouble.

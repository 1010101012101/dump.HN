5077364,comment,5074334,5074909,2,0,tcas,,,"The power distribution on a board is essential to it running properly. The 5v needs to go into 3.3v and probably 1.2-1.8v as well. You need to make sure that any loads on the power net won't cause a momentary voltage drop below any component's tolerance. You also want to make sure that the components on the far end of the board will receive the same voltage that everything else is receiving. Next you want to make sure that any digital chips won't inject noise on the line and have their own power reserve via decoupling caps. These capacitors need to be speced out to block specific frequencies and placed accordingly. Also, grounding is super important to consider as you want to have a stable ""0V"" reference (for digital only designs this means having a dedicated ground plane, mixed analog and digital can have separate ground planes).<p>Now, for most hobbyist designs the rule of thumb is use a simple LDO and the recommended input/output caps (1-10uF) for it and use wide traces to route the power in a star like fashion. Also put a 100nF capacitor next to each power pin for noise and to serve as a power reserve.<p>More complicated circuits / circuits that will need to go through FCC will require more complicated power distributions. Most professional boards (with high frequency signals on it) that will meet FCC will be 4+ layers, with a dedicated ground and power planes. A PCB I just designed with an FPGA on it had something like 50 capacitors for just the 1 chip, with physical size requirements for each type (the smallest capacitors were 1mm x 0.5mm to block the highest frequency noise, anything bigger won't be as effective).<p>Don't let this deter you however, looking back on my first schematic/PCB designs I'm amazed at how much better I've gotten. Microcontroller designs with a few chips are very, very lenient. If you mess something up it will likely still work, but your performance won't be as good (i.e. if you use a built in ADC it may not be as accurate, or you might not be able to reliable run it at it's max clock speed)",1358488413

Dead wrong. If you do everything to please your wife, you have a serious personality disorder. I don't mean that in a bad way, I mean it as a statement of something you might not realize.<p>I like dressing up because I like dressing up. I've worn a suit around the house on a lark, I wear ties to a n office where T-shirts are the norm. I absolutely do not do it because I'm trying to please or attract women. On the contrary, it probably seems stuffy and uninviting.<p>I work out because I want to be in good shape, so I can go on cycling trips, and live a longer and healthier life. I don't do it because I want women to stare at my abs (they're coming along, promise).<p>I saw a counselor while I was in a relationship to work through my issues independently. I ended up leaving my girlfriend, who I still love dearly, because I needed space to work through my own pathologies.<p>If I act assertive (and I usually don't), it's because I'm confident that I'm right, and I feel something is urgent. I don't push incorrect opinions on people just for the sake of being manlier than the other person. I try to be considerate of everyone's opinion, and make reasoned decisions. I frequently say 'I don't know', and then go and find out.<p>> According to society women should instead want men who are caring, sensitive listeners<p>The Ryan Gosling school of thought. Unfortunately, as much as you think you're working against society, you've just described a different caricature: James Bond. There are as many bad boys in movies as good ones, and the bad ones usually get the girl.<p>The whole premise of your post is that you live your life and define yourself to optimally please/attract women. If you define yourself only in terms of other people's opinions, you likely suffer for poor self-esteem. As much as the blog you linked is funny, it's not helping you work through your issues.<p>edit:<p>I forgot about<p>> Shrug.<p>You're honestly so afraid of a little introspection that you've resorted to writing out gestures of indifference.

2.  Take from each line segments a few points and do a (cubic) interpolation of the line segment.
3. Cut the line segment into two half, and redo 2. if you are not satisfied by the lines.<p>If you look at the formula, then you will see that something quite similar happens. The formula is always a sum of several sines, times two Heavyside step functions. [2]
The trick here is, that the product of two Heavyside functions will give you a function that is one for some interval and zero otherwise. Effectively switching off the part of the sum outside of the interval. And the sum of sines is essentially a Fourier transform of the line drawn.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_%28mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_%28mathematics%29</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function</a>",1358485287

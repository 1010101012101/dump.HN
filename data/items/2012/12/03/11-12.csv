4864983,comment,4859132,4860166,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Anna Karenina is a really beautiful story. I read it a long time ago and it is, at the very least, a great achievement, so sweeping, so intricately detailed, so many rich characters, so much insight into human hopes and struggles. I don't know much about its context but I imagine if you read up on Tolstoy's life and Russian social conditions at the time it would make reading the book enormously stimulating - a panoramic story covering the intersection of a flowering cosmopolitan aristocratic society and a more ancient world of feudal landlords, at a turning point in history shortly before that world vanished forever.<p>Mostly I would read Tolstoy for the same reason I would read Nietzsche - to break through our regrettable tendency to take the past and its people for granted. It's one thing to read about the ideas Nietzsche developed on a Wikipedia article, it's wholly another to read him in his own words and suddenly find yourself thrust into contact with a whole mind, a living, breathing bundle of thoughts and anxieties and dream, a human being palpably aching to find meaning, caught in the middle of one of the greatest social upheavals of human history. To get a sense, just for a moment, of the sheer enormity of the fact that whole generations of people lived and died without knowing anything of the world we lived in.<p>19th century literature is special. There is so much heat, passion, confusion, pain and soul-searching in it - it feels so close, yet so far, from the world we live in. For me at least it is humbling and amazing that people like Tolstoy laboured on and left behind such vivid traces of their souls for us to discover and enrich ourselves with.<p>Edit: I suppose this is a long-winded way of saying that the value of literature is that it helps you develop reverence and respect for the enormous reality and weight of history. Arrogance and shocking stupidity are the natural consequences of not realising your tiny place in history. The best literature breeds deep humility.",1354535308

To put it plainly : the ONLY thing the president cannot do to defend the constitution is to mess with elections. That's it. It also states that the president is the person making the assessment if an action is necessary (and thus, not the courts, though of course, the president can be removed from office for making a decision that either congress or the courts think was not reasonable. That does not change the fact that the president cannot be punished for implementing that action. The maximum penalty for any crime for the president is impeachment, unless this is specifically extended by congress).<p>This is because article 2 of the constitution overrides every other law in the US, except article 1, including all following articles and amendments.<p>If you think this sequence is by accident, you should talk to a lawyer about things like this. Sequence in laws, and the principle that earlier rules override later ones is extremely well established technique of law.<p>What everybody seems to think these laws state, that you have extensive rights without any qualifications whatsoever, is just plainly not true.

Universal adult sufferage regardless of sex, race, creed, property ownership. We all know about ""women getting the vote"", but men without property used to not have the vote, catholics/prodestants/muslims/jews (delete as appropriate) used to not have the vote. Race based voting restrictions are similarly common. Some countries allow restricting voting based on criminal record (USA) other's done (most of europe), some countries prevent current criminals being elected (UK did this after some IRA terrorists were getting elected).<p>* Inherent rights. Who gives you your human rights? The Crown/State? So can they take them away? Does everyone have rights? Or just people/men of the right colour/creed/aristocracy? Does everyone have the same rights? No. We view that everyone has rights all the time that cannot be taken away.<p>* Rule of law. You/anyone should be able to know what the law is. The crown/state cannot just make up a vague law that only they can interpret. Laws cannot apply retroactively. The law should apply to everyone. It should be wrong if a certain law doesn't apply to the local lord, but it does apply to you.<p>* Fair trials. It's wrong that the crown/state alone gets to decide guilt/innocence, there should be an independent trial. You are allowed to argue your case. You are allowed appeal. The jury cannot be punished for how they decide your trial. You should be presumed innocent. You cannot be locked up unless you have been tried.<p>* Constitutionalism. There should be a document that overrides the crown/state and defined how the state works. It should list what powers the state/crown has. The King/state is not allowed to just do whatever it feels like. (Fun fact: Nazi Germany, the USSR and the USA have/had constitutions. The UK doesn't really. :P )",1354532575

Often thought leaders, IE Mark Suster, would release some tips on TC and reading them can help you become more successful.  New companies may also have services that can give you an advantage.",1354532497

This is level DH0 (see <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a>).  If you keep posting these sorts of comments, then you don't belong on HN because you can't formulate a coherent argument against my points.  Other people can -- just look at some of the other replies I've gotten.  For some reason, you seem unable to do so.<p>In fact, I just looked through your comment history.  It's amazing how many of your posts are gray, indicating that you have negative points.  There are a lot of guides on the internet for coming up with better arguments (with more etiquette as well).  Immature arguments belong on places like Reddit or 4chan.  Hacker News holds itself to higher standards, so hopefully I can get you to reach these as well.  If you need some tips on good debate skills, I will be glad to share them with you.",1354532452

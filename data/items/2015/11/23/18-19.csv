10616437,comment,10612516,10615941,0,0,barrkel,,,"IMO if you&#x27;re to get the benefits of promises, you need to use callbacks rather than using synchronous accessors like a .get() method. Making a &#x27;get&#x27; accessor available just encourages blocking, reducing the very parallelism and asynchrony that promises are introduced to make usable.<p>When you chain and compose together operations on promises using a nice fluent API, you&#x27;re building up a monadic value that encapsulates the whole computation. You can then apply error handling to the final monadic value and be sure all errors across the whole computation will route to a single handler. When reading and writing code, the division between &quot;creating the computation&quot; and &quot;running the computation&quot; is thereby explicit and the error handling obvious.<p>I&#x27;ve found promises most useful in managing asynchronous operations in the browser. With UI widget support (disabling things for the duration of a promise computation, showing spinners, showing progress bars, etc., automatically handling errors in an error alert area) it makes non-blocking UI much much easier to get right. For parallelism, I find different approaches easier to reason about, whether it&#x27;s work queues or something like parallel LINQ / Java 8 Streams.",1448304983

Any idea when we first got there, or when the last trip was?  Unlike all the many highly valuable probe missions we&#x27;ve sent, here, most people actually know something about it.

I enjoy the intellectual engagement but I have difficulty keeping pace with a full course load. At the same time, programming is one of the few skills I have and feel like I can consistently exploit, next to maybe report-writing and to an extent public speaking. AFAICT the latter are auxiliary to careers and are difficult to make as a primary thrust with living pay. (I&#x27;m not too confident this is 100% true, but I suspect that it is true.)<p>So irregardless of my academic performance I wish to develop my programming ability. Becoming a competent self-taught, self-marketing programmer seems like a fairly large task. I am wondering how the self-taught among us broke into the industry, whether the same industry conditions hold now as then, and how to go about finding gainful employment as a self-taught programmer.<p>If anyone has any insight or advice on these questions, I humbly accept it.",1448304591

They are Linux again, so have their own package manager. Then we run Python (with virtualenv or Buildout) or Node (with npm), that again have their own package managers that try to provide isolated environments. And of course they run bytecode in the Python or Node...<p>And that ridiculous stack is used to run some relatively mundane web app that can&#x27;t even mutate its data directly, and is used to send some set of Javascript and HTML and JSON to the user&#x27;s browser.

I watch sports (on TV) only occasionally, and then only a couple teams. I don&#x27;t play video games. I do listen to music and go to movies, but generally avoid a lot of the really popular ones because they just don&#x27;t appeal to me. I don&#x27;t buy trinkets, nearly everything I own is useful, though I&#x27;ve started collecting some art recently (I like the look, and my home and office feel more comfortable with it around, so that&#x27;s useful if subjective). I buy enough new clothes that my clothes are in good repair, but I&#x27;m hardly fashionable. I can barely relate to many of my peers (professional and otherwise).<p>I&#x27;ve stopped viewing this as a bad thing, though. I have more time and money than many of them to spend on the things I want to do.

If I am killed or seriously injured doing so, it will harm society in a variety of ways--my insurance companies will impose the cost of my care on others, if I can&#x27;t work then overall economic productivity is reduced, if I&#x27;m permanently disabled then Social Security will have to pay for my care, if I die or can&#x27;t earn a living then my family might need various government aid programs.<p>Now you might say that these are not really harms, because they are planned for in advance. Insurance companies and government programs employ statisticians to help predict costs and set their rates accordingly. But the same is true of addictive drug use--not everyone will choose to use addictive drugs, and private and government programs can use statistics to predict the level of treatment and assistance they will need to provide.<p>Or you might say that you&#x27;re only thinking of direct physical harm, like a drunk driver killing people who are themselves acting responsibly. But there&#x27;s a difference between regulating the use of dangerous equipment under the influence, and regulating drug availability in general. For adults, alcohol is generally available with little restriction. So the question is, why not other drugs, too?<p>It seems like the more that we create shared services to help each other out, the more that individual risks become accountable as risks to society, and therefore create opportunities to regulate behavior.<p>It sure would be nice to have some sort of consistent framework for what gets outlawed and what does not. Right now we have ridiculous situations like: cigarettes are legal but demonized, pot is illegal but tolerated, and alcohol is legal and celebrated, despite being in many ways more dangerous than cigarettes or pot.<p>And this does not even get into the nascent social battles over food, nutrition, and weight.

Part of the fun is to see that it can learn to stay on topic - to decide it&#x27;s talking about a raspberry beer and continue to talk about rapberries. As far as fruit vegetable beer being a catch-all category, that&#x27;s only within fruit beers. They&#x27;re certainly distinct from IPAs, stouts, porters and lagers. Interstingly, for classification, far the hardest categories to disambiguate are Porters and Stouts (probably because stouts really are &quot;stout porters&quot;).<p>Our goal was to pick a few categories would allow us to evaluate the capabilities of the model. Thus having some that are crystal clear and others heterogeneous was appropriate.

The problem is, as you state, that virtually nobody wants to have to administrate a server!<p>In-home devices which accept connections are not relevant as they are inaccessible without giving your home network a well-known name. Any device which is not accessible from the Internet at large is not meaningfully a part of the Internet--it&#x27;s simply on <i>a</i> network. Of course, you can set up port forwarding and buy a domain so you can access these devices from the Internet, but that fundamentally changes the situation. This is really the important distinction here: &quot;servers&quot; have <i>known names and addresses</i> on the Internet and &quot;clients&quot; do not.<p>When you want to communicate with your friends, you do it by name or address; in the current model of the Internet as something 99% of people access via 3g on phones (with all kinds of network-side firewalling) or via their home router&#x27;s dynamic IP and NAT, most users do not have any well-known address. The only way they can find their friends is by coordinating to both use some third party site. This is what it means for the current architecture of the web to encourage centralization: the most efficient way to let everyone find all their friends is for everyone to congregate at the same third-party location, i.e. Facebook.<p>We haven&#x27;t moved away from that because the decentralized alternatives have tended to suck, requiring running your own server all the time at a fixed address; actual progress would involve eliminating servers entirely and replacing DNS with a distributed name-lookup service that&#x27;s actually designed for this use-case, and then having your mutual friends play the role of mailservers when you and your peer are playing phone-tag and not simultaneously online.",1448303062

In the US, you generally only need to worry about eggs and fish sauce, or beef/chicken broth in soups, and I&#x27;ve rarely (maybe never) had trouble getting a vegetarian or vegan meal in a Chinese restaurant anywhere in the US, Canada, or Mexico. I do often ask for clarification about whether a dish has fish sauce or eggs, and if I can get it prepared without, but I&#x27;ve never had a dish appear with shrimp that didn&#x27;t advertise it had shrimp; given the price of seafood in the US, restaurants like to brag when a dish has seafood in it. I also never order soups at unfamiliar restaurants unless they are explicitly labeled as vegetarian or vegan.<p>Thai and Vietnamese restaurants are more likely to have fish sauce in almost everything, though they&#x27;re usually happy to make a vegetarian version. Korean restaurants seem tricky, as there&#x27;s almost never anything vegan on the menu, but bibimbop can be ordered without meat or egg, even if they don&#x27;t offer a tofu version. But, none are as consistently easy to order from as Chinese.<p>I&#x27;ve been told that when traveling abroad, in some regions in Asia (including some parts of India), saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Buddhist&quot; will help the wait staff and chef understand what you mean when you say &quot;vegetarian&quot;. I don&#x27;t know exactly where or whether this is entirely accurate, since millions of Chinese are Buddhist and not vegetarian.

If you don&#x27;t like the EULA, then you can choose to not use the software in question. Of course an EULA cannot override copyright or contract law. Plus many companies claim that software licensing is not a sale, hence the first-sale doctrine does not apply. The EULA for Microsoft Windows famously says that Windows is licensed and not sold.

Basically, the problem was reduced to checking about 2000 specific graphs (the checked property was more complex than simple colorability). The reduction part was very complex but still checked by humans, but checking the ~2000 graphs was a computationally expensive process that took computers thousands of hours to complete, which was completely infeasible for direct human verification. There was a lot of controversy over whether this counted as a proof. Since then the proof has been simplified to 600 special cases and run through a proper proof assistant (Coq), so it is now pretty widely accepted as proved.<p>It&#x27;s not quite analogous since the core of the proof was still human created and checked, and the basic form of the computer generated portions was well understood (i.e. the kinds of steps they used). There is some extra doubt involved when this is not the case, since it&#x27;s possible the computer came up with a novel proof of inconsistency if we don&#x27;t know at all how the individual parts of the proof work.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem</a>",1448302412

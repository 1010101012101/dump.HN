4391541,comment,4387407,4390975,3,0,einhverfr,,,"It's not just MyISAM though.  The fact is that these things actually make sense when you think about MySQL as being a content-management backend for the web.  The problem actually has to do with SQL modes, the fact that MySQL will silently substitute table backends for you, and much more.  Again in some environments this is ok, and if you have total control and tight control over a small number (preferably only 1) of applications hitting your db it isn't the end of the world.<p>But PostgreSQL folks look at MySQL from a different perspective.   It's a db-centric rather than app-centric perspective.  In this perspective your db <i>needs</i> to <i>guarantee</i> that declarative constraints <i>will be followed.</i>  In this perspective the db is the center of the environment, not the bottom tier of the app stack.  In this perspective you could potentially have <i>dozens</i> of apps using a single db.<p>It isn't a matter of MySQL having grown up a bit (and it has).  It is a matter of it not having outgrown the content management and/or single app per db environment in which it arose.",1345129052

4391500,comment,4390885,4390885,78,0,chrisacky,,,"Reading down through all of the comments, I can see that people have a totally mixed opinion of how this can happen. Some people think that the US have no intention of wanting to extradite and charge Assange, but Assange and his counsel have repeatedly (in the last month) requested that the US make a statement confirming this. The matter of the fact is, many high profile American's have said that he should be killed, and put to death.<p>Onto the other topic of the rape charges, I think some people don't fully understand the facts surrounding the charge. I didn't either until I spent thirty minutes and read this article: <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/07/19/3549280.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/07/19/3549280.ht...</a><p>But from this transcript... these are the key points:<p>-------------<p>The ""sexual assault/rape/molestation"" charges were filed after two women Anna Ardin and Sofia Wilen went to the police to seek advice if they could compel Assange to take a STD test since they did not use a condom during sex.<p>Both of the women went to the Klara police station in central Stockholm, however, it is mentioned that Ardin had gone along primarily to support Wilen.<p>Ardin had been frequently in the company of Assange. She had previously described him as such a ""cool man"" (Twitter). They also arrived and left together at a Crayfish party (equivalent of a cocktail party). Ardin was sharing accomodation with Assange and had refused an offer from someone else for temporary accomodation.<p>The day after the accusation of rape and molesation Ardin sent a SMS saying : ""I've just spent some time with the coolest people in the world"".<p>SMS text messages were also exchanged between Sofia and Ardin, which showed that the two of them knew of the relationship between each other and Assange.<p>Ardin responded to a friend who was looking for Assange : ""He's not here. He's planned to have sex with the cashmere girl every evening, but not made it. Maybe he finally found time yesterday?""<p>The Swedish police, totally railroaded the investigation. Interviews have been leaked with Assange, and Wilen commented initially ""that she became so distraught she refused to give any more testimony and refused to sign what had been taken down."".
Assange went freely for interview to the police station and was released without immediate charge, and was free to travel. Almost immediately there after, another warrant was issued for his arrest.<p>Eventually, it was also upgraded to an Interpol ""Red Notice"".<p>It's alleged (from the transcripts), that Sweden has frankly always been the United States' lap dog and it's not a matter we are particularly proud of. The Swedish Government has... essentially, whenever a US official says, ""Jump"", the Sweden Government asks, ""How high?""<p>Assange's legal team are clearly trying to point out that US is coercing all of this behind the scenes so that he can then be extradited from Sweden and face trial for conspiracy to commit espionage.<p>> The burden should be on the United States Government to say, ""We are not planning to prosecute Julian Assange"". If they just gave that assurance, I can guarantee you that Julian Assange would go to Sweden tomorrow.<p>----------------<p>This is hugely and unequivocally politically motivated. I'm British, and I am largely ashamed that pressure is not being placed on Sweden by the foreign minister to have them reinvestigate the extradition request. Also, Sweden will, and has previously done all it can to scratch America's back.<p>Assange should stay put, until US says ""we will not pursue extradition from Sweden"".

Combine this with the lack of computer processing at the time means that you have a human operator trying to determine from a scope which targets to attack.  I think that this makes detecting and tracking u-boats with early radar very unlikely.

On the one hand you have the <i>hack</i> -- the one-off prototype thrown together simply to verify what can or can't be done. On the other hand you have the <i>design</i> -- once you know what perspective is best, to build the system from that perspective and validate that your intuitions are building one coherent whole.<p>Kay's Law is that the right perspective is worth 80 points of IQ: that is, if you find the right way to look at a problem, you can do things with the ease of someone with a 180 IQ who didn't have the advantage of that perspective. How do you get a good perspective? Well, there are a couple different ways. Some are pre-made perspectives: for example, <i>dynamic programming</i>: ""let's just build up all the solutions in order from n=0, reduce everything to some other problem we've already built up."" Some are intermediate, like <i>wishful thinking</i>: just imagine that magically, you have functions which you don't have, so that you write an algorithm which is correct, but references a bunch of functions which don't yet exist.<p>Some approaches to new perspectives are more general: <i>hacking</i>, for example, is when you try a bunch of things which just barely work, to find one which does. Another is <i>duck solving</i>: explain your problem out loud to an inanimate object (like a stuffed or rubber duck), and half the time you'll accidentally create a perspective purely for explaining the problem which is useful for solving it. These are very generally phrased because ""problems"" are a very general topic for intellectual discourse.",1345128390

Protectionism sends shivers down the spines of policymakers in developing countries. My country (India) has seen great progress in the last ten years thanks to relaxed trade and red-tape.<p>I am writing this on an Apple laptop. I love this machine and it is reasonably affordable for me. There is no incentive for an Indian company to ever produce a good laptop. Even worse is that there is never going to be an ecosystem in India that will work on complex engineering problems that go into making such a machine.<p>So while I enjoy as a consumer, I am only adding to the imbalance. It is not only for engineering products. China has become the producer for many simpler products that could have been made in India. I chose to become an entrepreneur and maybe will try and fix a miniscule part that imbalance some day, but I am not sure how many will. Are Indian producers better off because of China? I don't know.<p>For many decades, my country has been running a trade deficit at the cost of inflation. It all seems fine so far, but there is something surely wrong here. China has been doing the opposite, they have decided to become super producers, which is never possible in India because of the complex decision making.<p>In the ideal scenario, there must be a balance between global and local. It cannot be all global and no local (or the other way round), which is often a matter of perception. Globalization + technology has led to concentration of capital and the the playing field is not level. I still feel people everywhere must try and level the field.",1345127576

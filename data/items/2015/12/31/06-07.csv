This will be done through the introduction of a third party which holds the property in an &quot;un-owned&quot; state.<p>The virtual currency is created for the previous owner when properties enter this state, and destroyed when a buyer uses the currency to buy a property. This currency essentially becomes a real estate backed currency which floats in relation to national currencies as the real estate market fluctuates.",1451545194

Coreboot, support for as many peripherals a possible, etc.  Most importantly, the elimination of the issue of hardware support and the notion of a list of &quot;supported hardware&quot;.<p>Why not?\nPerformance, latest advances, etc.<p>Hasn&#x27;t this been done?  \nMaybe.  OpenWRT, etc.?  But my understanding is that the use of Linux on this router was initially the non-public work of a company, Linksys, and the open sourcing by Cisco was neither anticipated nor intentional.<p>How is my idea different?\nThe project would be free, open source, but intentionally focused on a _single_ target.  Big tradeoff, but maybe some interesting gains.<p>To be clear, I like the idea of hardware that is more or less &quot;OS agnostic&quot;, e.g., RPi and booting from SD card.<p>But I am tired of watching volunteers struggle to keep up with the latest hardware (many thanks to the OpenBSD and FreeBSD contributors who write drivers for networking, etc.), or having to settle for binary blobs.<p>Maybe I am just dreaming but I could forsee such a project potentially growing into a symbiotic relationship with some manufacturer if the OS developed a sufficiently large, growing user base.  And these users were all purchasing a very specific item(s) of hardware, known to be supported by this OS.<p>If you comment, please remember I am not a Linux user.  And hardware support is not quite the same under BSD.  As such, it is something I often have to think about and cannot just take for granted.",1451545177

How much of what you do is distribution-specific?

And some projects are just boring to work on, for example GUI-stuff or the code-monster Xorg.<p>I would not want to bundle all 300 distributions into 1, but (and this of course boils down to my opinion) 20 or so would do. It is important to have alternatives, like non-systemd distributions, rolling releases, source-based distributions, et cetera, but 300...<p>And if the focus is less on having 300+ distributions and more on making 20 or so distributions great, quality would rise without a doubt, not only ease of use, but also support, documentation, et cetera.<p><i>btw: Visited this page from Firefox, was greeted by the following:<p>Reported Web Forgery!<p>This web page at linuxfonts.narod.ru has been reported as a web forgery and has been blocked based on your security preferences.<p>Web forgeries are designed to trick you into revealing personal or financial information by imitating sources you may trust.<p>Entering any information on this web page may result in identity theft or other fraud.</i>",1451543785

Employing paid shills is much more a Google thing than an Oracle thing; Oracle prefers lawyers.<p>I was, however, a fan of Sun.<p>> Please reconsider the effect Oracle&#x27;s litigation has on the entire software ecosystem.<p>And what effect is that?

Let me make this short and hopefully clear: Google copied part of an Oracle/OSS API and broke compatibility in order to make a profit. They didn&#x27;t try to build an interoperable alternative to Sun&#x27;s Java, but to get into a ready-made market of Java tools and developers. The question of API copyrightability had never been settled, and whoever would have come after Unix <i>after</i> the ruling would (and certainly could) have done so <i>before</i>. Even if APIs are copyrightable, there&#x27;s still fair use, two of those defenses -- interoperability and non-profit -- would apply to most implementations, but possibly not to Google&#x27;s.<p>Sure, maybe APIs shouldn&#x27;t be copyrighted (again, this is only language-level APIs) -- I can see good argument for either side -- but the effect of their copyrightability on the software industry is at worst minimal, and is most likely nil because of a thing called &quot;fair use&quot;. I am not aware of another case where a replication of an API was done both not in order to build a compatible product and for profit.<p>Besides, their &quot;view&quot; wouldn&#x27;t have even been made (as I said, Oracle didn&#x27;t set out to make a legal point) if Google had only licensed Java in one of the two available ways, one of which they are finally doing now and the other they could have probably afforded at the time.

If you work at the front desk, you can fuck around on the computer, but you can&#x27;t take a book out and read. One looks like work, the other looks like fucking around. You can&#x27;t make your organization look bad. The perceptions are more important than the substance. If you can&#x27;t get the perceptions right then you were never going to make it in corporate America, and should probably stick to contracting.<p>So the way to actually do this is, to look like you&#x27;re working, but actually be producing nothing. When they complain, you can say you were busy on X, where X is some obviously unimportant meaningless detail. That forces your boss to clarify what he expects you to be working on.<p>That your boss never asks you about specific tasks means that your defined role is to be a repository of knowledge and not a cog in a machine. This is a good thing, knowledge workers can bullshit their way to perks that the rank and file could only dream of. My current job is just such a thing.<p>The key to this is understanding that nobody actually knows what you do.

10816451,comment,10812214,10812893,0,0,i336_,,,"This comment FTW.<p>I&#x27;m using Slackware right now; a few years ago I tried Arch. I completely agree that it felt too tentative, way too tentative. You basically have to have a nervous system that&#x27;s in top shape to be able to deal with what Arch throws at you - it might be <i>this</i> update that renders your system broken, or the one after that, or maybe the update next week, or &quot;oh, 3 packages changed, I&#x27;ll add them before I go to bed in 30 seconds.&quot;<p>Granted, it&#x27;s not usually that bad, but the anticipation and mental preparation must be there. And, in my case, my nervous system doesn&#x27;t actually work properly :) (appt. with specialist in a couple months, hopefully!) so I&#x27;m the worst-case example of where this approach definitely doesn&#x27;t work - hand me a system like this and expect me to maintain it, and I&#x27;ll just go NOPE. I don&#x27;t have the attention span for it, you might as well have asked me to carry 1000 spiders across a room.<p>But, the problem with Linux is the widespread policy of fragmentation, otherwise known as &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;. In practice that translates to &quot;know about one thing and know about it well,&quot; and if you read Linux soley from that point of view, IMO everyone fulfills it perfectly. Zoom out a little and take in the bigger picture, and it becomes painfully obvious that everything is compartmentalized to an incredibly damaging degree/extent.<p>And yet, because of this prevailing attitude, all the &quot;system integration&quot; attempts and efforts are plagued by their own NIH and intentional scope limitation, so everyone tiptoes around everyone else for the sake of choice, and nobody says &quot;that&#x27;s it, we need do do XYZ this way,&quot; accepts the responsibility of world domination for XYZ, and, if it&#x27;s necessary, evangelizes XYZ as The Way To Do This(TM). It can be done: <a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/29/204"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/29/204</a> (note how (a) nobody contested it and (b) it was socially appropriate to accept it due to the context - it&#x27;s often socially inappropriate to do this kind of thing in Linux.)<p>And so, because of the lack of integration, &quot;looking at the bigger picture according to a standard&quot; and so forth, it&#x27;s impossible to formally define my Arch configuration which differs from yours in 10 areas such that the definition succinctly represents those 10 datapoints. Rather, you&#x27;d crash into the point of irreducible complexity at n-thousand, or at best n-hundred datapoints, because nothing integrates with anything else. (No, I definitely don&#x27;t have the attention span to even fathom how you&#x27;d try to begin integration work. Nuke it from space maybe? :P)<p>Nix and co. are trying to build superintegrated systems the only way that&#x27;s currently possible: teaching the package manager about the entire system, making the package manager the source of authority (which makes high-level integration possible), and having the package manager regenerate (or at least check/retouch) everything on every invocation. This necessitates the user learn to configure their system solely by way of the package manager, but at least it means you can pass the representation of an entire system around as a multi-KB configuration file, and handing said file to the package manager on any system then waiting a while will reproduce a predictable configuration...<p>...<i>for those package versions.</i> That&#x27;s the point where everything still breaks apart.<p>I didn&#x27;t completely use to understand (is that correct grammar?) why systems just did security releases/updates, why backporting was a thing, etc. Now I do: it&#x27;s so you can apply the security update yesterday with minimal eyeballing and integration testing and have a fairly confident outlook that the patch won&#x27;t introduce subtle bugs or require system changes.<p>The likelihood is that in practice the small occasional ancillary change a security patch might introduce might occasionally require integration work or removing said small side change(s) from the patch. So effort does still need to be invested in a small niche percentage of situations. (I&#x27;ve always been curious about what kinds of contexts this would call for; anecdotes welcome.)<p>But just about every sysadmin or Linux user out there would probably react the same way if they discovered me sitting at their main workstation (possibly SSHed to their production server >:D) adding &#x27;apt-get -y update; apt-get -y upgrade&#x27; to a daily cronjob: I would imagine 100% of them would be leaping in my direction, horrified; 90% would be exceeding their average Sound Like A Sailor quota, and about 20%-40% would be using their keyboard as a bat (with the 2% who own IBM Model Ms unfortunately succeeding).<p>And this is because, for any given upgrade, because nothing&#x27;s integrated in a truly neural-network-analogous model - where everything can see everything else and react to it - things inadvertently step on the toes of other things because they&#x27;re blind to anything except their own existence. And the problem is, there are so many different layers, the toes in question might be anything from library version conflicts, package manager confusion (dependency resolvers <i>can</i> reach mathematically unsolvable conclusions, requiring force-removal etc etc to fix), ABI/API breakage (because the maintainer for &#x27;unicorn&#x27; never realized the package for &#x27;libwobble&#x27; hasn&#x27;t been pushed yet because they were using a local version), software- or hardware bug regressions, forcing users to use an older software version... the list goes on. It&#x27;s not a big list, but the consequences are disastrous enough that it might as well be infinitely large.<p>I remember reading a long time ago how Chrome OS autoupdates on every bootup. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;that&#x27;s <i>really</i> impressive.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure if it still does that - I expect autoupdating is a background thing now - but it&#x27;s still impressive. Google <i>has</i> to do this since, it&#x27;s practically part of Chrome, and since Chrome OS&#x27; app sandbox is inside the web browser there&#x27;s no real need for system-level flexibility or additional capability, and this makes things significantly easier. The other boon is, but of course, the unique hardware situation; Chrome OS isn&#x27;t something a manufacturer grabs, Google approaches a manufacturer with a contract (basically a pile of money to make Windows temporarily look slightly less interesting, I&#x27;m guessing). This means Google are largely in charge of the OS, and the impetus is coming from Google to get it working in the first place. This means the system has pretty much perfect driver support.<p>I ran through a Slackware-current update the other day that fell apart most delightfully when I tried to upgrade aaa_elflibs to i586 by accident. After realizing what I&#x27;d done after 15 minutes (I use both 32-bit and 64-bit machines, the former more than the latter at this point) I fixed that then figured out the original &quot;fell apart&quot;: udev no longer existed, eudev had taken its place.

Supposedly, action was taken against the orderly - but I have no guarantee or follow up on that. Additionally, when the police originally arrived at my apartment, two officers searched it looking for a weapon (they found a steak knife that had fallen next to the stove which they questioned me about - I don&#x27;t even remember it falling there - could&#x27;ve been there for a while) - I am pretty sure they had no right to search my place, but I could be wrong.<p>The second time, I was forced to take double the dose of the medication I normally took for anti-anxiety/depression which actually caused me to hallucinate while I was locked up.

This leaves me with about one to two hours of free time at the end of the day and I&#x27;d like to use it productively to improve my programming skills. My goal is to enhance performance at a new job I recently started.<p>I&#x27;m debating between using that time to continue working on work stuff or developing a personal project that&#x27;s related to what I do at work. I fear that working more will cause me to burn out, whereas a personal project could supplement my work knowledge and avoid burnout because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m passionate about. On the other hand, what if my project is a waste of time? And if I want to get better at work related things shouldn&#x27;t I simply continue working on that? Any insight would be appreciated.",1451541814

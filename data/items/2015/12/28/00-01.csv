GP&#x27;s comment casts the options available to him in the following duality: either<p>1. push [his] theoretical children into this race, or<p>2. let them eat into precious time to figure things out.<p>Whatever my opinion of the article under discussion, I can only agree with its author that option 1 is a horrible mistake whose consequences for his children may accurately be called lifelong impairment.<p>Option 2 is no better, and it only even seems that way if you don&#x27;t think about it too hard. It implicitly accepts the premise, not that childhood is precious (which it is), but that childhood is precious <i>because, and in the way that, academia claims it is</i>. That&#x27;s toxic as hell, and it will poison any parenting that proceeds from it.<p>Specifically: He won&#x27;t be able to relax around his kids, because he&#x27;ll always have that nagging ambivalence that he&#x27;s doing wrong by them, failing to equip them to compete as functional adults in a world which does not care about them, and that will come through in his actions. It can&#x27;t <i>not</i>, and his kids will pick up on it, because a young child&#x27;s parents are by far the most important things in her world which are not actually <i>her</i>, and she notices everything about everything they do. She won&#x27;t intuit any of the paragraph I just wrote, of course, because you have to be old and jaded and cynical for that. She&#x27;ll just know her daddy is never happy or comfortable or relaxed when he&#x27;s around her, and with the unconscious, inevitable egotism of the very young, she will assume that&#x27;s because of something to do with <i>her</i>. And she&#x27;ll almost certainly never get over that.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I agree with David Benatar that bringing a child into the world is invariably harmful to the child. But I certainly have a hard time arguing other than that it&#x27;s harmful to bring a child into the world to endure the kind of parenting I&#x27;ve just described -- hence my advice to GP.<p>A better third option, if anyone&#x27;s interested, would be to opt out of the entire nonsense and raise your kids without reference to it. The trouble is that you are not more powerful than the society in which you exist, and it is interested in your kids whether you like it or not. You might find or make an enclave, and a method, in which to raise them without having them be too badly stunted by its more pernicious influences; people have done it before, are doing it now, and will no doubt continue to do so. Perhaps you will be among them. But it&#x27;s not implausible that your notional kids are better off never having existed at all, if you&#x27;re not even equipped to recognize the need to be willing to make the attempt.",1451263272

Determining which certificate to use can be difficult depending on the subject/issuer, and in general this is a terrible choice to ask a user to make.<p>The problem gets a <i>lot</i> easier if you use origin-bound certificates:<p><a href=""http://www.browserauth.net/origin-bound-certificates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.browserauth.net/origin-bound-certificates</a><p>With origin-bound certs there&#x27;s a clear and unambiguous answer as to what cert to use for a given origin by-design.

It is very easy to say Gujaratis are shrewd or follow the old-boys-club tactics but those are just typical human traits passed on culturally and sociologically instead of genetically. The basic Gujarati values mirror the basic Indian values (be peaceful, love everyone, respect elders, help the poor, be studious, work hard) but some are emphasized a lot more than others.<p>For every commenter in here saying Gujarat is a backwards place, I personally know a Gujarati who has donated large amount of money to non-religious public service projects. My uncle sponsors the education of 10 kids in our village in India and feeds 100+ people on the death anniversary of my grandfather. I am not saying he is a saint, I am saying he is just one data point among the tens of thousands of successful Gujaratis. It&#x27;s not fair to measure charity, benevolence, and kindness because one&#x27;s native place is not Singapore or Zurich just yet.<p>In the past few decades, our village has progressed significantly, with wealthier Gujaratis awarding scholarships to kids in need ( <a href=""http://www.balasinorcollege.com/found_trust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.balasinorcollege.com/found_trust.html</a> ). Is that enough to wipe out poverty from Gujarat or India? Absolutely not. Gujaratis are NOT any different from other people. Few great, most decent, and a handful of bad apples (e.g. Harshad Mehta). I don&#x27;t think the article was trying to highlight Gujaratis are some uber-exceptional race. It was just highlighting how ingrained business acumen is in the Gujarati ethos.",1451262351

If they get to 20% volume/weight/price of a gas tank I would predict a switch is going to happen very very fast.<p>Currently commercial batteries are price limited (about the price of a gas tank + filling up the gas tank 400 times, which would keep a normal car moving for 5-10 years), and weight limited at about 5% of the energy/weight of a gas tank.

The firmware hasn&#x27;t really been touched since 2008 and is running a buggy version of dnsmasq, miniupnpd and an out-of-tree Ralink driver on top of kernel 2.6.<p>If you think I&#x27;m lying, have a look at the firmware of any non-802.11AC DLink or Netgear router. Both companies are getting better but they&#x27;re at the mercy of the SoC manufacturer (Broadcom, Ralink etc).<p>802.11AC routers seem to be getting better, mainly due to the bandwidth requirements finally getting beyond 200-400mHz  MIPS chipsets.

I did so because more and more people I knew were getting more and more stressed at how pissed off their spouse was or that they never saw their kids. A number of them got divorced and could only see their children on every other weekend.<p>It will be interesting when he is 60 if he feels like he made the right choices.",1451261159

Never happened to me, but keep a $5 chaintool in your bag and you can remove the faulty link more quickly than you can fix a flat tire.  The gearing doesn't work?  Don't ride a geared bike if you don't know how to shift, and don't ride a racing bike when you're commuting.  Get an internally geared bike and you will never have gearing problems again.<p>The chain is one of the least problematic of any bicycle part.  But then again, there aren't really any problematic parts on bikes, which is why people like them so much.<p>Also, the reason why a hubless wheel is stupid is because there is nothing keeping the wheel round.  The hub and spokes on your wheel are not there to look good, they are there to give the wheel strength.  A metal rim like the one in the article will be bent unusably seconds after someone mounts the bike.  A carbon fiber rim will just break explosively the first time you go over a bump.<p>Anyway, what I've learned from this article is that people associate all the problems they've ever had with bikes with the traditional design, and want a non-traditional bike because they think it won't have problems.  The actual solution is to get a traditional bike that's setup for actual use instead of racing.  Racing bikes are not fun to ride to work.  Commuting bikes are.",1293922692

After that I'm out of here. I've learned that if you post an article with a title like ""What kind of idiot do you think I am, anyway?"" people will be very happy to tell you :)<p>1)  Facebook is always welcome to contact me. Happy to help them try to provide login help to the audience I've selected.<p>2) I don't have results yet, but I promise to post everything you could possibly want to know about the site in a few months. At the slow rate of traffic the site is getting, it's going to take a while to come to any useful conclusions.<p>3) I don't know. I was going to make an extended metaphor and never really finished it. I was trying to say that the average Facebooker isn't a college kid or programmer any more. They're, well, <i>average</i>. I'll make the change in the edits. This was something I thought about in the shower and just pushed it out there. Wrote the whole thing in 15 minutes without any rewrites, which is unusual for me. Very sorry for the poor quality.<p>4) Now this question is an awesome one. Riddle me this, batman, how do you use a text-based search engine to provide assistance to people who can't read? If you have no text, the search engine doesn't know what it's looking at. If you have lots of text, people can't use it. If you hide the text, well, search engines don't like that, either.<p>This was an initial stab. I'd like to try this again with another topic area, but I'm stumped with the problem you bring up. Perhaps a totally video-based site with extensive transcripts? It's worth exploring. You could even do the navigation in video format.<p>I screwed this site up royally by personally writing the text. I should have asked a elementary school kid to do it. Live and learn.",1293922550

2058714,comment,2057633,2057633,0,0,michaelchisari,,,"I grew up with a pretty strong culinary tradition (Sicilian-American), and it was only when I left home around 17/18 that I realized how privileged I was to have a grown up with a father and grandfather that were extraordinary cooks.  My grandfather was master baker at Gonnella for decades, a genius in many ways, and my father is easily following in his footsteps.<p>My family was not rich, but I would not have traded their cooking skills to have grown up eating in the most expensive restaurants.<p>It was not unusual growing up to have homemade bread around.<p><a href=""http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs887.snc4/72084_1507521417181_1508676473_31100003_2373676_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs887.snc4/72084...</a>\n(From my dad's fb)<p>My father bakes pastries as a hobby, at one point, he made three large bins full of different types of cookies because work was slow and he needed to keep busy.<p><a href=""http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs124.snc1/5331_1078752418224_1508676473_30208370_1023986_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs124.snc1/5331_...</a><p>While my grandfather was more traditionally Sicilian in his style, my father is more Chicago.

When I moved out, I missed it.  As I got older, I praised it.  When my grandfather died, and I realized that I had spent a solid week talking about food, even the Priest talked about it, I realized that I need to get serious about doing it.  When my father passes, it's up to me and my brothers to keep things going.  Without it, all I have is the name.<p>So I'm a big advocate of building and rebuilding a culinary culture.  It's easy for me, because mine never disappeared, but I understand it's more difficult for others whose families immigrated earlier, or whose cultures were purposely stamped out, to build that.  And I think, for most people it's about enjoying cooking, and understanding the ingredients, for me, a culinary culture can't just be about assembly.  It's about everything from philosophy to ideology, sex and love, family, emotion and science.  And so much a person's personality and memory is wrapped up in how and what they cook.  This Christmas, the first Christmas without my grandfather, my father made a traditional Christmas dinner, and it was heaven.  One of the dishes was called Scacciata, a salty bread with tuma cheese that's just incredible.  It was wonderful, but it was uniquely my father's creation, and I realized that I would never have it exactly the way my grandfather made it ever again.<p>I love America, but to be completely honest, the only thing I've ever considered emigrating over is the food culture.  I get so envious of other countries that if I ever I do decide to leave (doubtful), that will be the reason.<p>This was long and somewhat meandering, but I'll leave you with this final scene from The Big Night, one of my favorite movies:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerP7FRMWa8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerP7FRMWa8</a>",1293922443

Just a sample:<p>""Twenty calories, after all, is a bite or two of food, ... an absolutely trivial amount of overeating that the body then chooses, for reasons we’ll have to discuss at some point, not to expend, ... , so that we don’t overshoot by 20 calories a day. ... That’s matching intake to expenditure with an accuracy of better than 1 percent.""<p>The author, despite his qualifications, is numerically illiterate. Anyone who has seriously worked with numerical data understands the law of large numbers. If my body works to maintain some caloric level e, then over time the full meals I skip for seemingly no reason, or the second helpings I mysteriously decline, amortized over a scale of months, will balance out my caloric intake with severe accuracy. (Assuming I am predisposed to maintain a specific weight.)<p>Secondly, stating that weight gain is due to eating more calories than you burn is neither tautological, vacuous, nor inane. It might not be satisfying to the author, but it is a cogent and useful explanation of why people gain weight. Other, worse examples that institutions might give that would give people fewer clues about how to combat weight gain: ""you've angered some god,"" ""you're predisposed to be fat,"" ""you're eating the wrong kind of food."" The link expressed between consumed calories and stored mass is not logically trivial. Stating that I should eat fewer calories clues me in to track and reduce the calories listed on the side of foods I buy. If you want to get pedantic, a tautological explanation would be you're getting heavier because you're gaining weight.<p>It isn't worth dissecting the rest of the article. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. He wraps up a lot of obvious points in a lot of science that he doesn't understand.<p>P.S. - it isn't a mystery to anybody why people get fat",1293920370

Everything in the NYTimes article is correct (about how easy it is to cook those 3 basic meals etc), but it misses one thing: there is no way that someone goes from eating burgers and prepackaged foods to salads and lentils instantly, and it's not because it's difficult or time consuming to cook (it's not really for most things).<p>Restaurant food has a major convenience factor, but the NYTimes article completely disregards that it also just plain tastes better than a salad to most people.<p>As someone who hates healthy food, lives in NYC where I can literally order delivery off the internet, and is trying to cook a lot more, you can't force two things on people at once: healthy eating AND cooking.  I'm beginning to really like cooking, but only because I'm making things that aren't super healthy.  My mother is a librarian and highly encourages her kids to read comics because to her they are a) totally valid reading material and b) are sometimes a gateway drug to much more reading.  It's the same with cooking: teach someone to cook a butter burger and fry up some potatoes first (they'll still probably be knocking a few hundred calories off a restaurant version of the same meal anyway) and get them hooked on it.  Maybe they'll transition to healthier stuff, worst case you at least have them eating SLIGHTLY healthier, and far closer to the source.<p>TLDR: Make a man a salad and he will order delivery for a night, teach a man to make salad and he will order deliver for a lifetime.",1293920056

Optimize what you eat before you optimize how much you eat. It is more important to eat good clean food rather than eat small portions of still bad food.<p>3. Exercise fast, short and incredibly intense.<p>#1 is something I say to catch them off guard and eliminate excuses (genetics).<p>#2 is the real issue. The past 25 years of diet information in the US is basically misinformation. We were told that we had to eat less fat and cholesterol and we would be healthy. Science has shown this not to be the case but we are just now catching up to that science.<p>For instance...this is an ideal diet for nearly everyone: \n1. Eliminate grains, sugars and most fruits (high-glycemic index fruits for sure: think watermelon) \n2. Load up on veggies, eggs (best protein source around) and meat (high fat meat is great...no worries)\n3. No oils other than coconut or olive\n4. Unless you are trying to gain weight, minimal starches (potato/sweet potato etc)\n5. Some nuts...don't go crazy with them. \n6. some fruit, but only of the berry/cherry variety\n7. minimal diary<p><a href=""http://www.paleonu.com/get-started/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paleonu.com/get-started/</a> is a great place to start.<p>#3 is b/c low intensity exercise doesn't really do much for your metabolism...it is a slow calorie burn that lasts as long as you are doing the activity. High intensity workouts boost base metabolism for as long as 36 hours.<p>I wish I knew this when I was a teenager...feels like lost years battling diet and weight only to seek the information later and realize the errors of modern conventional wisdom.

2058598,comment,2058447,2058447,0,0,jdietrich,,,"Dear design students:<p>The standard upright bicycle has looked almost exactly the same for over a century, for very good reason. The basic diamond-frame design is very close to perfect. A derailed-chain drivetrain can exceed 98% efficiency, is cheap to build and is trivially easy to repair and maintain. I love folders, I love recumbents, I love full-sus mountain bikes, but for 99% of riders and 99% of journeys, precious little has changed since the baby boom.<p>There have been four meaningful breakthroughs in bicycle design in the last fifty or so years. Shimano's indexed derailer gears, Rohloff's SpeedHub, Mike Burrows' Compact Geometry and Andrew Ritchie's Brompton Bicycle. All of them were painstaking developments that took years of work. Burrows' Compact Geometry is a change as trivial as sloping the top tube on a standard frame, but it took years to get right.<p>I see dozens of these bicycle design concepts every year and every single one I have seen has been absolutely terrible. In the case of this design, the wheels would be so lacking in lateral stiffness as to make the bicycle frightening to ride and the epicyclic rear wheel would be lucky to go ten miles before self-destructing on road debris. Won't work, never will work, never should have been committed to paper.<p>The designer had seemingly no interest in the century of development behind the modern bicycle and no inclination to investigate why the status quo is as it is. He bumbled in and designed something cool-looking but useless, because he obviously has no interest in such trivia as the laws of physics. Personally, I think that these bicycle concepts embody the antithesis of good design - a useless, style-led attitude that rarely leads to anything but last year's model wearing this year's tailfins.<p>If you want to design table lamps and dribbly teapots, keep churning out this hogwash. If you want to change the world, start designing with your brain, not your felt tip pens. The world is full of vital, urgent, life-or-death design problems, but they need substance, not style.",1293919983

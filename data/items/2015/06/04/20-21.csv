If California repeated like it did 15 years ago and made a &quot;market&quot; called the California Water Exchange, and required water-supply entities to sell to separate aqueduct companies... and if the aqueduct companies were required to deliver water to farmers/consumers/industry at a government-fixed price ... with the supply available on a 1-day-in-advance contract basis only ... and if they made up special mandatory fees when water moved across state lines that people could exploit for fun and profit ...<p>then yeah, that&#x27;d be pretty stupid and wouldn&#x27;t solve anything. because the entire point of moving to a &quot;market&quot; structure is <i>to make the price variable</i> (and in the case of a drought, making water more expensive).

We even had green energy companies that you could choose to buy your power from even if it was a little more expensive.<p>Then Enron crapped all over it with fraud and collusion.  And, of course, since it was Dubya in charge, the Feds did ... absolutely nothing.<p>I&#x27;m not a free market defender.  However, we will eventually need something like a market in electricity; there are going to be too many suppliers sending electricity into the grid.<p>In addition, had lots of electricity suppliers existed, Enron would not have been able to get away with what they did.  The whole reason Enron could do what they did was that they could deplete the grid capacity by taking single power plants offline for &quot;maintenance&quot;.  If you could backfill that capacity and make money, Enron never have been able to pull that off.<p>That was why the Republicans went out of their way to sell off California&#x27;s electricity <i>producers</i>.",1433451418

9661976,comment,9657158,9657502,0,0,mrxd,,,"As a UX person, I&#x27;m intrigued by this idea, but I would probably avoid creating situations where it is necessary to apologize. If you confirmed a flight, hotel and rental car, but then came back with a &quot;Sorry!&quot; later, that would be a negative experience for a user. They may have passed the confirmation on to others or set other plans in motion, which may also have to be &quot;rolled back&quot;. You would need to compensate customers for the inconvenience.<p>The way to avoid that is to show requests in a pending state, but this has other implications. Users will want to continue to shop and to cancel pending requests, which might mean lost sales.<p>Generally it&#x27;s more important to paper over the realities of a complicated system when you have a customer-facing self-service tool. Exposing those realities might create too much complexity for self-service, and you may need sales and service people to manage it. Basically you&#x27;ve built a travel agency instead of Expedia, which, again, is more costly.",1433451198

If you look at what the original G3 case was like, where there was a latch on the side that lays the case open with easy access to memory and hard-drives, a design improved upon throughout the early Mac Pro models, you can see they were never intentionally user-hostile.<p>In the interests of shrinking components and improving reliability, though, in an appliance-like product such as the Mac Mini, it makes sense.<p>Notice that the new Mac Pro has <i>extremely</i> easy access to the memory slots.<p>For most people, the memory that comes with their computer is the memory that computer dies with. This holds true for all kinds of systems, especially laptops where in most cases people don&#x27;t even know or care how much memory they have.<p>It was <i>nice</i> to be able to save a little by buying third party memory, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world that you can&#x27;t.

I will definitely be re-using some of these examples in my own conversations.<p>That said, there is a sad irony to the proposed solutions. Having to take measures to hide from the authorities is precisely what Anne Frank and her oppressed peers had to go through, and we all know how well that panned out for them. It is also, in its own way, a form of self-censorship and a huge impediment to one&#x27;s freedom.<p>Not to say that I don&#x27;t appreciate the author&#x27;s advice on this, as I do take some these measures myself, but the problem first and foremost is the ridiculous escalation of power by those in charge. The article even discusses some of the core issues on this matter:<p><pre><code>  Although the law is incomprehensible to the governed, ignorance of the law is not a defense when you’re prosecuted by the government.\n</code></pre>\nAs well as:<p><pre><code>  The institution of government is defined by its monopoly on both the creation and enforcement of law.\n</code></pre>\nThere needs to be real transparency, accountability and separation of concerns. Short of a revolution, I&#x27;m unfortunately not completely sure how this can be achieved.

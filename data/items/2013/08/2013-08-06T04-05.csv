For the piano, you&#x27;re much better off creating a keyboard that lights up the right keys at the right time so you just place your hands on top of them, and build muscle memory faster that way. For string instruments (including the guitar), you&#x27;re not really able to look at your own hands, and looking at someone else&#x27;s hands in a reversed view is confusing - and can be done with a video overlay vs. any augmented reality. Could I be overlooking a teaching mechanism here you had in mind?<p>&quot;Navigation overlays and guided tours with Wikipedia information popups.&quot;<p>Yeah I generally think overlays are better uses for computerized glasses. However my question was targeted specifically at augmented reality, which I consider different from straight-up overlays such as Google Glass showing you a map. Perhaps I should have clarified better.<p>&quot;Virtual stores occupying empty physical space.&quot;<p>This I like. I was actually tinkering with software to make a marker-based AR haunted house. Basically there would be QR-code-like markers everywhere, and as you&#x27;d look at them through the Glasses, something scary would pop up =) Regardless, the haunted house idea seems like a novelty. And the virtual store thing seems to imply that lots of consumers would have computerized glasses - or the store could own them and lend them out, but then how many do you need to buy, and is it really worth it?",1375764796

I kinda know wahat you are going through. I took it upon myself (after numerous have failed) to push through something that looked like a pretty nasty bug in Lotus Domino 8 server and client. Basically what I found out during research is 20% of IBM 852 (its internal datatype) was simply corrupt.<p>And boy for the longest time nobody responded. There were IBM SWAT Team Leaders guarding the sacred Process that would insist on telling me that there is no Bugs in their platform and that it is obviously my fault. It took six months, an extremely detailed testing procedure with test cases and invoking a lot of connections to get my report infront of a person that could actually understand what is going on.<p>Soon after that I received a hotfix. I had to repeat the whole procedure another two times. And by the third time I could get it done in three months. I basically made the blue elephant dance just for me.<p>So for what its worth my advice is to invoke every and all connections within Google not to just get your issues within an internal Google issue tracker. You need to find out (from the outside) who is the guy responsible for the general area that is causing you problems, then keep in touch with this person and after some time you will get your fix(es).",1375764586

There are multiple alternatives to nuclear power, and I&#x27;m not aware that there are higher levels of death associated with most of them, coal being the notable exception.<p>2. The risk profile of nuclear power is not well-understood.  Humans have hundreds to tens of thousands of years of experience with fire, water, and wind power.  We&#x27;ve been toying with atoms for about three-quarters of a century, with commercial electrical generation for only about half of that.  In that time large areas of land have been contaminated, and a number of serious plant or reactor accidents have occurred, several of them contaminating large areas of land until at least 2050 (64 years after the accident), possibly longer.  The effects of the Fukishima disaster are still being revealed.<p>3. Few conventional power plants (natural gas plants with significant on-site storage being a potential exception) have catastrophic failure modes with more than a very small affected region.  In terms of both longevity of effects and area, acute impacts are limited.  By contrast, when things go wrong with a nuke, then tend to go very phenomenally wrong, and it can be unclear, even after a significant period of time, what the full consequences and extent of damage are.",1375763068

Secrecy in law enforcement can be a valuable tool: it allows things like protection and development of informants, lawful surveillance, undercover operations, etc.<p>Prosecutors have never been required to turn over ALL evidence -- only exculpatory evidence (and that does not include evidence that might be useful in jury nullification, only evidence that would tend to prove the accused innocent of the charges).  Withholding evidence of guilt from the defence is common: it is done to protect sources and ongoing investigations or even to shorten a trial.  If you have more than enough to convict, why trot everything out?<p>The described &quot;parallel&quot; investigation is another common technique.  If you have a source of evidence you need to protect, then you develop different evidence and instead use that to secure the conviction.  Provided the evidence used is real and is sufficient to prove guilt, no laws or moral codes have been transgressed.<p>Law enforcement and prosecutors use inadmissible evidence all the time to pursue an investigation.  The point of an investigation is to secure sufficient admissible evidence to successfully convict (prove guilt of) the perpetrator.  But the rules don&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t use all the information at your disposal -- only that some of it might not be useful for you at trial.  (Full disclosure: there are, and should be, rules governing what law enforcement and other state and federal agencies can do in collecting evidence.  But disclosure of all information, evidence, and techniques to the defendant is definitely not one of them.)<p>An interesting corollary is the so-called &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; problem.  If a critical piece of evidence is deemed inadmissible, it might take with it a bunch of other evidence that was generated based upon it. Courts frequently permit the prosecution to re-introduce some of the evidence if  it can be shown that it could have (not &quot;was&quot;, &quot;could have&quot;) been developed without access to the inadmissible piece.  This is precisely the parallel development narrative described, and it is a very common tool.<p>I agree that this particular system seems well beyond the pale, but lets not pretend that suddenly getting rid of secrecy in law enforcement and removing prosecutorial discretion is a no-brainer solution.  Lets also not pretend that this isn&#x27;t a clear extension of standard practice (albeit a pretty major and troubling extension we might want to trim back a bit).",1375763007

This will be my last post, though I'll read whatever you post in response.<p>Your last post seemed scattershot to me, but I do want to respond to what I think was a very peculiar argument in your first sentence.  <p>The US isn't forcing anyone to burn hydrocarbons, of course.  But a treaty is still important, because many smaller nations will conclude that if the huge emitters aren't going to change, there's no real point in sacrificing themselves (to some extent, this was Australia's rational for rejecting Kyoto).  <p>There's an article in this week's economist about applying prisoner's dilemna to global warming action - where it pays to defect (let other people do the heavy lifting on reducing emissions).  If the rest of the world gets it together on global warming, then you'll get a free ride.  If the rest of the world doesn't - well then we're all going to hell in a bucket anyway, so why bother with sacrifices?  But if everyone acts this way, we'll all be much worse off than if we had cooperated.<p>The economist article also points out that while defections pay off in single-run games, they don't necessarily pay in repeat games, where subsequent punishment for previous defections may cost more than the benefit of the original defection.  In this context, the community of nations who <i>do</i> cooperate may be able to punish defectors severely enough that they prefer to come on board.  <p>I suspect that California is trying to signal to the world that it is cooperating, not defecting, on global warming - by making a very big and public break with national policy.  This, along with other policies, is part of the california ""brand.""  While California needs to do more (and an editorial in the SF Chronicle comparing California's policy to New Zealand's shows that we are in no position to get smug), this is no bogus fabrication.  <p>

64554,comment,64536,64549,0,0,mrtron,,,"I also put the most emphasis on execution when it comes to starting off.  I think ideas really are a dime a dozen.<p>I guess the trickier question comes when someone has a lot more domain knowledge and some contacts in the field.  This knowledge can translate into a ""good idea"" that is solving a problem in the industry.  How much does this factor in?",1191801124

64549,comment,64536,64536,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Ideas by themselves are not worth very much. Its really about how the idea is executed that matters. Apparently ideas are not worth much very much in the legal sense either, unless backed by a patent.<p>If you are just starting out you might want to consider an equal 1/3 split between everyone. For our startup, I've been doing most of the work up until now, but I still insist that we each have equal share. I want everyone to be accountable and feel responsible for the companies success. Basically, no one should ever feel less obligated due to a lower ownership percentages; we all have to work our asses off 100% in order to win. Even small changes to the initial split could alter this balance. At least that is my opinion. ",1191800079

This isn't hacking-related, so apologies in advance.<p>The most important element of a good shave is by no means the razor--it's wetness.  If you start using a shaving brush and a good cream (the kind that comes in a small tub, not an aerosol can), and make sure your skin is always wet, the improvement is something like switching from a chainsaw to a scalpel.<p>Secondary to that is the razor.  In my experience, the best shaves are to be had with a single-blade safety razor.  The learning curve is steeper, because it doesn't let you get away with all the bad habits and sloppy technique that pivoting, vibrating, multi-colored blades forgive.  After three or four shaves, though, you're all set.<p><a href=""http://shaveblog.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shaveblog.com</a> hasn't been updated in a while, but its archive is informative and well-read by shavegeeks.",1191800066

64545,comment,64475,64530,0,0,shawndrost,,,"I don't understand; I'm not very educated about economics.  If a country has a surplus of money, wouldn't it make sense to invest that in countries that are appreciating, like those with trade deficits?  (Investments like real estate, stock, etc don't show up in trade balances, do they?)  Then there's no oversupply of ""bullion"", and I don't see why trade surpluses can't expand indefinitely.  <p>In fact, the phrase ""oversupply of bullion"" doesn't even make any sense when I think about it.  Bullion is defined as ""that stuff that can be exchanged for anything else"", so how can you have too much of it?<p>If these are stupid questions, sorry :)",1191799347

Cool it.<p>This is exactly why I hate the choices we have.  With the electoral college an independent candidate has exactly zero chances.  You put your finger to the two things that I can't support on the ""standard"" Republican ticket.<p>I am far closer to a Libertarian, which means that I think people ought to be left alone.  I am also an atheist, which means that I have no issues with gays or lesbians at all.  And by no means am I behind foreign aid to buy friends or fighting wars anywhere at all.<p>Given that, who do you vote for?  A vote for a Libertarian candidate (or any other party for that matter) is a wasted vote due to, among other things, the electoral college.  I will never happen.  You'd have to have the earth's poles shift for a Libertarian to have a chance to appear in the radar with this system.  So, I have no choice but to ignore some of the things I don't like with both the Republican and Democratic parties and choose based on what I can get behind.  Lesser evil, if you will.<p>I chose to support Romney because I felt he is better equipped to deal with the financial disaster we are navigating.  To me, looking ahead 25 to 50 years, nothing else matters.  I say this because I know full-well how fucked-up a society can become if the economic framework that surrounds it is compromised.  I have lived in countries that suffered from exactly that problem.<p>I did not vote for Obama because (a) I still don't think he knows what he is doing on financial/economic matters and (b) I really don't like how the democratic party blatantly resorts to buying votes though handouts and benefits being given to large numbers of unionized workers.  Our entire welfare state votes democrat because they need it to keep going.  And you end-up with generations of people wasting their lives away.  Politicians don't care.<p>I lived in Argentina for about ten years and was witness to how ugly (and effective) these populist manipulation methods can be.  Obama KNEW that he was buying millions of votes when he threw your and my money at the auto companies.  Somehow that has become acceptable in our country.<p>Anyhow, Obama won.  We'll see what we are in for.  I am hoping that he does the right thing and genuinely works towards addressing the real problems we have on the table.

4752058,comment,4751489,4751489,3,0,chubbard,,,"Every point he makes is absolutely correct, and I think comparing them to computers as a rising technology is apples to oranges.  For one computers made most of its improvements exponentially because the number of transistors doubled every 18 months.  3D printers don't have an equivalent part, like the transistor, that just simply scaling up makes things perform better.  The things holding back are outlined in his article: limited choice of materials, lower quality of the part, slow print times, high cost for mass producing, inability to mass produce, etc.  All of this will improve with time, but it won't be on the same time scale as computers.<p>Now there are somethings I don't think he discussed that change manufacturing because it requires imagining a different way of working.  These are the more transformative changes that might have no previous equivalent to compare them to.<p>For example, the ability to have a de-centralized, agile work force.  My wife worked for a company where the M.E. were in the states, but software teams were in Europe.  They were constantly sending manufactured parts with people as they physically traveled between offices.  It was far cheaper to do this than ship the boards and cases of manufactured products to the team.  However, with a 3D printer they could email the CAD drawing to the other office and in a day they could print it out.  This is a big change in how fast things could be turned around, and save $1000's of dollars, allowing them to iterate faster.<p>Another change is 3D printing molds for doing injection molding.  Some rapid prototyping shops already do this today.  Creating the molds is time consuming, but 3D printing gives you faster turn around.  And also more complex molds.  This plays to 3D printings strengths low cost for low volume one offs.  The quality of the part could be a problem, but hopefully that will improve with time.<p>I agree with what the author said, but I see the real limit right now is our own imagination for how 3D printers enable us to do new things we can't do now.  This is where I see 3D printers are like computers as making something that was impossible before possible.  These are much harder to predict.  In a way it wasn't just computers that transformed us as much as the internet.  Maybe there a companion technology that changes much of these assumptions made.<p>If we find a problem  that 3D printers do better than anything else some of his assumptions could really change.  For example, his assessment of 3D printers in homes right now is 100% accurate, but there might be some application we didn't see today for which 3D printers push into the home without significant changes to technology.",1352260903

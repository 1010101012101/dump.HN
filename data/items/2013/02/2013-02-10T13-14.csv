Over 10 years of working to encourage and develop amateur creators in the film world has left me with the conviction that we simply don't know what would happen if 100% of a Western country's people didn't need to work to survive any more.<p>We'd almost certainly hit a sudden epidemic of depression, to start with. Tim Ferriss' book ""The Four Hour Work Week"" has a fascinating section on surviving the transition to not having to work any more - it's harder than you'd think.<p>But subsequently? A surprising amount of popular activities in leisure time right now are actually very mentally engaging. Both watching and playing sports are actually reasonably mentally engaged activities for a lot of people - try memorising half the statistics that the average baseball fan has at his fingertips and see how far you get. The most popular drama television is getting more complex and sophisticated, not less. And of course games are actively mentally engaging, and increasingly creative - Minecraft's the biggest gaming sensation since World of Warcraft.<p>The fact that the two biggest gaming sensations of the last decade are ones in which the primary activities are a) working with groups of up to 40 other people to complete complex, challenging, multifaceted choreographed tasks and b) building massive structures up to and including 1-1 replicas of goddamn <i>cathedrals</i> does not lead me to believe that most of the population doesn't like to use their brain.<p>Add to that the fact that there's actually a startlingly large number of amateur musicians, painters, writers, bloggers, artisans, chefs and similar pursuits out there.

[...] It's in them to worship authority and to totally rely on it.[...] It makes sense to me that a strong and faithful believer [...], can in his disappointment become so venomous when, as he feels, that authority has failed him.

Our fraternities are almost always tied to one of the two major political parties (SPD or CDU). While beeing a great asset for students after graduation (Alumni-Network) their main service for that offspring is to use all the dirty tricks to get you your (law) diploma. Since these student bodies are very old and established, they often fill the ranks of the personnel in the universities. They might be the ones doing the evaluation of your thesis. They can provide you with the tests beforehand and even if they can't they usually keep log of every test written by a professor, so they can provide you at least with a good approximation of future tests.<p>It doesn't wonder that there's an established market for ghostwriters providing you those titles, since you have so many people using that ""reliable path to power"" that don't seek the academic or professional acceptance at all. Most of Germany's politicians are lawyers and most of them never seen a court from the inside.<p>For me, this Title-Thing is a teutonic trait but it's not tied to genes but tied to culture. And culture can change. This German Title-Mania is getting less. For instance, you don't have to own a ""Meister""-Title to open up certain businesses anymore since recently. How this disposal of the ""Meisterpflicht"" (allowance to open a business is tied to having a Meister-Title, by law) came upon, though, tells about the difference between Germany and the US: It wasn't a succesful grassroot kind of story, demanding personal/economic freedom, but an order from the EU.<p>And the sentence ""an order from above"" sums up pretty much every German right or freedom we were entitled to during our history. That makes us prone to dislinkg ""game-changers"" because, if you spent time obeying the rules, you won't loose on that investment by letting others take shortcuts. This translates to less career changers than in the US, and a higher stigma if you do. It translates to total absence of entrepreneurs or acclaimed business people from entering a political race, because social envy gives them no cance there. This translates to parts of our Acadamia being a thought free market of status. We don't have an american culture of self-education. And the term ""Populrwissenschaft"", scientists releasing books for the masses, is considered an insult in German Acadamia.",1360502775

Would you like to change the way we write about Europe? At Europe & Me (www.europeandme.eu), we want to establish a new paradigm for European journalism: instead of stories aimed at individual national audiences, we write from a transnational perspective. Since the magazine began, this has partly been made possible by a great website design, and we want to go on pushing boundaries in this area.<p>Were currently looking for a new tech editor, and if you want to work with an international team, solve a different technical problem every week and help create an innovative magazine, this could be the job for you.<p>This is a flexible role, which would depend on your interests: we are primarily looking for a webmaster, but if youd like to be involved in layouting articles, training others, or developing new features for the website, you're very welcome to take on these roles! You'll get useful experience in a whole range of areas, and meet people from all over Europe.<p>The project is fully voluntary and not for profit, and all positions are unpaid.<p>Interested? Think you could help? Have an idea to push our magazine forward? For more information, contact application@europeandme.eu. Deadline for applications: 7th of March 2013.",1360501996

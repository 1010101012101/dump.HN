I have answered and asked many 'stupid' questions in my lifetime and will answer/ask many more. Asking stupid questions is a part of learning. You are reading far too much into my use of the word stupid.<p>My point is that if I agree to an interview, I would much rather have an interesting technical discussion with one of your engineers than be asked brain-teasers by someone from HR.<p>I would politely answer the question and would not dismiss it. However I find the practice off putting in general.<p>Fermi problems are a game that give you an estimate of the person's thought process. Another way to gain an estimate of a person's thought process is to engage that person in intelligent conversation on just about any subject. I much prefer intelligent conversation, as it can actually be quite pleasant.<p>My biggest weakness?<p>The interviewer clearly is interested in something contrived and job related. But what are they looking for? Do I spin it and say how ""my biggest strength can sometimes be a weakness when..."" Am I honest and tell them what my actual job-related biggest weakness is?<p>If I just straight up tell you something like ""I'm incredibly disorganized and never show up when you tell me to,"" I'm clearly not going to get the job. You don't get any points for honesty. Do you want something where the interviewee has spun his biggest strength? It is dishonest but a better answer.<p>Asking my biggest weakness is really just you asking me 'What do I want to hear.' Another game... I don't know you very well; how could I possibly answer it? So there it is, my biggest weakness is reading your mind. :)<p>Or maybe my biggest weakness is over-analysis. In what context of the words 'biggest' and 'weakness' would you like this question answered?\nSize/importance/grandeur/impact? \nMental/medical/social/skill competency?<p>Literally speaking, it would probably be the oxygen supply on earth.

3965255,comment,3964774,3965040,9,0,jerf,,,"In the end, there are no bright shining lines in psychology. It is likely that psychopaths are on one end of a bell curve rather than being a distinct, binary pathology. Neveretheless, we are free to observe that there is such a dimension and discuss those on the extremes in certain ways using certain terms, just as we do with depression or OCD, both of which have the same characteristic of not having a ""bright line"", yet clearly existing.<p>One of the most powerful ways to understand psychology is to see its history, like math's history, as one long attempt to create and refine definitions that let us discuss the field. Except where math is using those definitions to create the field from scratch and the effort is to build up useful systems from the bottom, psychology is trying to understand an incomprehensibly complicated system from the top down and using those definitions to try to break things into comprehensible and consistent pieces in a landscape that is being aggressively fuzzy and resistant to classification.<p>I do find myself wondering if you have not encountered any apparent interviews or research on psychopaths not because it doesn't exist, but because you've never gone looking for it. There's quite a bit of it. There's still some professional skepticism on the topic of it being something distinct, but that's rather different than the skepticism you seem to be expressing. The phenomena aren't so much what the debate is about as what the best way to slice and dice it up with the definitions are. For them to professionally agree that psychopathy is a real thing carries additional implications beyond just what Merriam-Webster writes in their next dictionary edition, but it's easy for a layman to misread that as an argument about whether the phenomena described by the debated term exists.<p>So, of course it's a label. But it's used to describe something far more different-than-baseline than just being a plain ol' jerk. In fact, psychopaths are often not jerks at all. ""Jerk"" is usually used to describe someone openly abrasive and simply randomly hostile, and that's not what a psychopath is. At least, not as an adult. As the article says, they lack emotional empathy but develop a cognitive empathy, and generally learn by adulthood the thing that jerks never do, which is that open hostility really has no advantages to anybody. They learn far, far more subtle manipulation techniques than that. (We all learn how to manipulate; I'm not convinced they are ""extra skilled"" at that. They simply learn how to do it with one less constraint than most of us.)",1336859306

Lambda, map, and reduce were all components that Guido very much wanted to remove, as he felt they had no place in Python.<p>Python is an object-oriented language, and the fact that it is a more purely object oriented language than (for example) Java allows one to use functions as first-class objects in ways that <i>appear</i> to be consistent with a functional paradigm, but that doesn't mean that the language supports a functional approach. That would require support by the interpreter for some key<p>Put another way, what's the difference between the following?<p>> [f(x) for x in xrange(10)]<p>> map(f, range(10))<p>Without knowing the difference in the underlying implementation, you can't <i>really</i> be sure - it's possible that map() is just a syntactic alternative to a list comprehension, and you could write an implementation of Python that did just that. If we're talking about CPython, though (which we are), then we have to know that the latter is using a function object that is retrieved once and called multiple times, and the former is using a function object that is retrieved ten times. In the latter case, we have a function <i>object</i> that contains a bound method which receives the implicit parameter 'self' and an integer within the range specified, and <i>this</i> method call is what is, in idiomatic Python, producing the values that are then used to create the list. Also, xrange is using a generator, which requires several function calls in itself, whereas range creates a list (which is handled differently).<p>That isn't necessarily so inconsistent with a functional paradigm, but my point is that the implementation is more important than the function names - simply saying that map() and reduce() <i>exist</i> doesn't mean that Python is a multiparadigm language. Python is incredibly eager-evaluating and it does not optimize tail recursion, two things which make it hard to argue that Python supports a truly functional style.<p>As noted by another commenter, this is not an accident; while you can fake functional paradigms syntactically with Python's extensive implementation of first-class objects (including functions), <i>the explicit goal is to discourage use of recursion, as well as other functional ways of thinking, in favor of iteration, and other imperative/OO ways of thinking</i>.",1336858960

Insisting that they choose from my list of pre-approved spending options does more harm than good, from a utility standpoint. From an emotional standpoint, it's condescending and demeaning.<p>In the second case, the person has few employment options and a weak support network, otherwise they would not be out on the street. They won't use the money I give them as well as people in the first category, but who am I to say what they want or need? I'm not trying to solve a social problem. I'm trying to ease the suffering of an individual.<p>It's difficult to distinguish people in the third group from the people in the second group, since mental illness and addiction often work in tandem. I don't bother to try. Anyway, the addict's hierarchy of needs is roughly: Food > Drugs > Shelter. If I buy them a sandwich, they can spend the remainder of their money on drugs. If they're a serious addict, a lack of charity won't stand between them and the drugs they need. If they can't scrounge up enough money through legitimate means, petty crime is the next step. Overcoming addiction is a complicated process that comes from within. You can't starve the addict into going clean. If I give a homeless person a dollar and that money goes towards drugs, that's a shame, but at least it eases their suffering for a moment.<p>Again, giving money to a homeless person isn't a long-term solution to social problems. It's a small gesture from one individual to another. They have a cut, so I give them a band-aid. Homelessness is a difficult and complicated problem. Withholding charity won't suddenly result in homeless people straightening up and flying right. The reality is that many of them, at least in the short term, are unemployable. Withholding charity just increases their suffering.",1336858879

3965190,comment,3960488,3964187,2,0,jules,,,"> However, if we do that globally, we're back where we started, right?<p>Hmm yes you're right.<p>> The idea about compiling functions twice and using a dynamic switch on function entry seems to presume that it can be determined at function call whether a continuation will be captured somewhere within the call and I don't see how you'd do that.<p>Ah! I meant that the switch determines where in the function call we were when the continuation was captured, so that if we rebuild the stack frame we can go back to the right place.<p>Okay so I'll here try to describe the method more clearly (also to clear it up for myself, I haven't thought about this for some time).<p>First, lets answer the following question: What's in a stack frame? Or equivalently: What's in a delimited continuation?<p>A stack frame is a data structure that we build right before making a function call, to keep track of what do after that function call completes. So what we need to save is two things: the code that we should execute, plus any of our local variables that that code will need. But there is also a third thing about a stack frame: a place indicating what to do with the return value of the function we called. All of this is neatly described by a closure: a closure is (1) a piece of code (2) a local environment (3) has a parameter. The parameter is the place we put the return value of the function we called. The return value of the closure will be the return value of <i>our</i> function. So if we are a function that returns a value of type T, and we call a function that returns a value of type Q, then a stack frame for completing the rest of our function call is a closure of type Q -> T. The whole stack is represented by a stack of stack frames. When we have a value of type Q, we continue running the program by popping the topmost stack frame, and calling it with the value Q, which gets us a T. Then we pop another frame, and call that with the T, and so on until the stack is empty. Contrast this with traditional continuation passing style, where the whole stack is represented by a single function which is the composition of all these stack frames.<p>To capture a continuation, we simply copy the stack of stack frames. But there is a problem: in most languages such a stack frame is represented by a particular structure in memory, not by any data structure that we can get our hands on from within the language. We could build it ourselves before each function call, and pass that down to the call in case that call needs to capture the continuation, but that would be prohibitively expensive because it incurs a heap allocation on each call (just like normal CPS). So instead we're going to rely on the machine stack for efficiency, and only construct those program level stack frames when a callee wants to get hold of the continuation. To do this we need a data structure that holds a partial continuation:<p><pre><code>   struct CaptureCont:\n      member stackframes # stack of stackframes\n      member target # the function to pass the continuation to when we're done building it\n</code></pre>\nThe way that the callee signals to us that it wants a continuation is by allocating a CaptureCont, setting target to the function it wants to pass the continuation to, and return this CaptureCont. In other words, callcc(f) can be defined as:<p><pre><code>    def callcc(f):\n       cc = new CaptureCont\n       cc.target = f\n       cc.stackframes = new List\n       return cc\n</code></pre>\nIf we called a function that did not return an ordinary value but it did return a CaptureCont, it is now our duty to extend the cc with the rest of the stack frames. To do this, build a data structure out of our local stack frame by saving the local variables and the bit of code that's still to be executed in our function, and push it onto cc.stackframes. Then return the cc to our caller, so that it can finish the job of pushing the rest of the stack frames onto cc.stackframes. This goes on up to main(). At that point cc.stackframes is a valid representation of a continuation. So main simply calls cc.target(new Continuation(cc.stackframes)) to pass the continuation to the right target. Continuation is just a wrapper around the stack frames. A continuation can be invoked with a value, which passes the value to the topmost stack frame, and then that result to the second topmost stack frame, etcetera as described earlier.<p>The crucial question is: how do we represent a stack frame? We need to do two things with a stack frame: at each call site, we potentially have to construct it. The second thing is that we need to be able to invoke it. The former is going from a machine stack frame to a program level stack frame, the latter is doing the inverse: taking a program level stack frame and constructing it back on the machine stack. If we simply represent a stack frame as a closure, this will lead to code size explosion as you note. To solve this problem we need a bit of trickery.<p>Take any function, like this one:<p><pre><code>    def foo(a):\n      x = bar(a);\n      y = baz(x); \n      ...\n</code></pre>\nSince it calls bar and baz, and since bar and baz will perhaps capture the continuation, we need to be able to represent both the stack frame for what to do after bar returns and a different stack frame for what to do after baz returns. For every function in the program we will define a single function that can take a program level stack frame and build a machine stack frame out of it. We will represent a stack frame as a triple: (1) that function that can rebuild it (2) an integer `i` indicating <i>where</i> in the function it should start (3) an `env` consisting of local variables. The function that rebuilds the stack frame will need 3 pieces of information: the `i` and the `env`, and the return value of the function we called (after all, the reason that we needed the stack frame is because we did a function call; this return value is the return value of that function call). For example, for foo:<p><pre><code>    def foo_rebuild_stackframe(i, env, ret):\n      if i==0: \n         a = env['a']\n         x = ret\n         goto L0\n      if i==1: \n         a = env['a']\n         x = env['x']\n         y = ret\n         goto L1\n\n      L0: \n      y = baz(x); \n      L1: \n      ...\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, foo_rebuild_stackframe takes the i and the env and the return value, and resumes the computation that that data represents: first it builds up the local variables, then it jumps to the right place in the computation.<p>Note that on the assembly level, this code duplication is not necessary, because we could replace the original foo with:<p><pre><code>   def foo(a):\n     x = bar(a);\n     goto L0\n</code></pre>\nBut I don't think most languages or compilers allow gotos across different functions, unfortunately, so you need that 2x code duplication to avoid any overhead beyond the if statement after each call, in the case that no continuation was captured (instead of `goto L0` we could do `foo_rebuild_stackframe(0, {'a':a}, x)`, and we could even arrange it so that no allocation was necessary, but that would be one extra function call overhead per function call in the no continuation case).<p>Each continuation can now be represented by a triple consisting of a pointer to the <func>_rebuild_stackframe procedure, a numeric index, and an environment. Now we're going to transform the code to <i>build</i> such a stack frame (i.e. go from machine stack to program level stack).<p>To do that we take take each function foo and for each call that foo makes (say bar(a)), replace it with:<p><pre><code>    x = bar(a)\n    if x is CaptureCont:\n      x.stackframes.add(new StackFrame(foo_rebuild_stackframe, n, ENV))\n      return x\n</code></pre>\nIn the above example, n=0 and ENV = {'a':a}.<p>Does this sound correct to you?<p>I apologize for the wall of text. If I find time I might post another describing in more detail how this lets you do the more powerful <i>delimited</i> continuations with the same low overhead on normal calls and amortized O(1) overhead for capturing a continuation. Note that traditional stack copying is O(call stack size) since if you repeatedly capture the continuation deep inside a call stack you capture the whole stack repeatedly. But in this case by rebuilding the machine stack one stack frame at a time you never capture the same stack frame twice, which means it's O(1) amortized time ""spaghetti stacks on demand"".<p>There are a couple of problems with this. The first is that it does not address tail calls at all. Tail calls will still overflow the stack. An extension of the same approach can solve that problem: keep track of the call stack depth and when it exceeds a value that you know could lead to stack overflow, capture the continuation and immediately invoke it :)<p>The second problem is that some languages, like JS, don't have gotos. That means that you need to find another method to represent the same control flow as in foo_rebuild_stackframe. When foo contains loops, that might pose a challenge (jumping back into the middle of a loop). Though it probably can be solved with code duplication linear in the nesting level of loops or something. If somebody who is good at turning goto code into (efficient!) structured control flow can explain how I'd be very grateful.<p>A possible extension of this is an optimization for escape continuations: for escape continuations you don't need to allocate any stack frames because they will not be used anyway. This lets you implement e.g. exceptions on top of continuations more efficiently (basically it turns exceptions into return codes for error handling as used in C). Another possible optimization is for coroutines: perhaps you can somehow reuse a previous stack frame for the next coroutine pause.<p>Another note: these stack frames are trivially serializable, so it's very easy to implement crazy things like a function teleport(address) that serializes the current state of the computation, sends it over to another computer over the network, and continues running there.",1336858130

In my interpretation, Linus believes this results in lost efficiency, which gets worse the more commit messages you have to read/handle on larger/more active projects.<p>If you work within GitHub's UI only (and rarely look at your shortlog / git log on the command line), you'll never know about this because the web UI hides this fact. That seems to be what Linus is getting at - that the tool (git itself) was built to be awesome on *nix platforms, and GitHub effectively ignores this aspect of git.<p>Finally, since the web UI doesn't enforce the proposed standard, you effectively create two groups of people: people who work through the web UI (or other UI-based tools), and people who work from the command line. Only the command-line people really suffer. However, if everyone (even people who work in the web UI) would conform to the standard, not only is everyone happy, but it encourages people who write commit messages to be more succinct, effective, and precise in their messages.<p>That's pretty much what I took from it.",1336858015

And much of it sloppy, and inefficient. code, written in easy to learn high level languages.  But people are so easy fooled.<p>You have an asset that most of your ""competition"" lacks.  You have knowedge of so-called ""real world"" problems.  The ones that face the O&G industry.<p>Lua is an example of a nice bit of programming that came from working with the O&G industry.  It's small and efficient for what it is.  It will continue to grow as computers get smaller.<p>I think having exposure to the pragmatism of the O&G industry may be a real advantage for you.<p>There's money to be made through laziness and hype, the Ruby, Python, Javascript people have proven it.  You can sell games.  You can serve online video.  You can run a photo sharing operation.  And so forth.<p>But what the world really needs are good, pragmatic programmers tackling real world problems.  Lots of computing power is being wasted on junk.",1336856593

Huge companies poisoning people, land, and wasting tons of food is a problem.<p>Sexism? Just a bunch of people who live practically perfect lives, and have no problems, and are bored, so they create some.<p>I'm slowly finding this conversation too Orwellian. Why do you care about what I think?!? I might be a phedophile, a rasist, but as long as I'm not hurting other people, I'm better that 99% of the world population. I find some people (so far only women) attractive, therefore I'd like to have sex with them, if I got a chance (I don't actively seek such chances, because sex with most women is boring, in my experience, unless (my) emotions are evolved). I don't make sexual comments at work, not because I would think they are inappropriate per se (I wouldn't make comments about someone being fat either, not because I think it's unappropriate, but because I don't want to hurt their feelings even more without good reason), but because at work, I like to focus on work.<p>Edit: to put things into perspective: my grandmother was born in 1930s. There were 8 children. One died very young. Her father was killed by nazi collaborators. He had a job. Her mother didn't. She had to support a family of 7, I don't know how. They made a drink out of tree bark, because coffee wasn't available.<p>My grandmother smiles more that most people I see commuting daily on the London subway. When people say, ""we have a crisis"", it makes me smile and think how deluded they are...",1336856556

Socio/Psychopaths (henceforth, SPs) can actually function pretty normally (I have worked with one before)...Hollywood tends to portray them as ruthless killers (a select few are).  To answer the title's question, you can determine if a kid is a psychopath at a relatively young age...and you should take whatever precautions necessary.  In particular, you should be careful if your kid wets his bed at a later age and is cruel to animals -- two symptoms of more agressive SP archetypes.",1336856523

It isn't uncommon (or at least it was in the past, maybe this has already been fixed) when performing an update in iTunes to get a large number of dialogs in a row.<p>Also, while it may be difficult, it would be nice if there was a way to improve the experience when running games that use Game Center. (They often force you to put up with the game running slowly as it tries to connect and it annoys you by showing you two dialogs; I think the typical OpenFeint experience is a little better.)<p>And mobile browsers should allow extensions.",1336856479

Broadcasters have taking to making commercials ""flash"" with bright, momentary images, in order to distract/attract attention.  When viewing live, I find that the (audio) mute button is no longer sufficient.  I'd like the screen to e.g. go 50% gray, where I can still see what's happening when I look at it, but it's no longer distracting me by ""flashing"" in my peripheral vision.<p>Given that TV's all have some degree of computerization, these days, I want mine to be open source, for reasons precisely like this.",1336856454

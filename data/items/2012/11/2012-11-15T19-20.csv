Since they keep all of this data, anything you do today could be used to promote something in the future without your knowledge. Hell, even visiting a group/business may pop something up ""jetti came and saw [insert business here]...shouldn't you?"".

In the dying days of the Clinton administration Barak offered Arafat a recognized Palestinian state, but Arafat didn't agree to the terms. Maybe the terms were unreasonable, but most sources agree that Arafat didn't even bother with a counteroffer. Sharon made enough concessions to the Palestinians to alienate his own party. Even Netanyahu acknowledged the right of Palestinians to their own state in May, though I'm not optimistic on the chances of him successfully negotiating terms. Still, the two-state solution is agreed in principle. It would be a positive development for Israel to officially commit to that, though.",1353009342

Even if they screamed, it wouldn't be counted as a priority. You can see this happen in local restaurant traffic. They tend to have higher amounts of IE6 traffic because office employees are scoping out their menus from their work machines. This is going away though too, but not because of upgrades. Instead, it is going away because those employees are more and more likely to carry a smartphone.

It's a watered-down version of the Lieberman cybersecurity bill, to which CISPA was a watered-down market-friendly alternative. From the thread on the original disclosure of the EO:<p>The Obama bill (note: Obama-supportin' Democrat here) is worse than CISPA: an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink bill that randomly creates incentive programs, new research organizations, a ""cybersecurity tip line"", and federally funds research into DNSSEC (DNSSEC: Rated S for Statutory).<p>Also worth noting: nothing in the Lieberman bill that this EO is patterned on creates enforcement mechanisms for IP and copyright enforcement, or for collecting customer information from ISPs. Of course, neither did the GOP's CISPA bill. That's because neither regulatory effort is about user information.<p>The problems both of these ill-conceived bills are addressing are simple.<p>Problem 1: There is no coherent strategy in the (vast, sprawling, chaotic) federal government, which is the largest IT operator in probably the world. Every agency does something slightly different. This means (a) nobody is doing exactly the right thing (usually, they aren't doing anything close to the right thing) and (b) it is prohibitively difficult to introduce new technology to help fix things, because everyone you'd get to buy it has a different set of hoops to jump through.<p>Problem 2: If you were a foreign adversary who wanted to cripple the US with electronic attacks, you probably wouldn't bother hitting government IT systems. Instead, you'd go for something like the power grid, or a trading exchange. Those systems are privately operated, and so nothing the government does to try to track, monitor, or deflect online attacks can benefit them.",1353006076
4790149,comment,4788659,4789463,5,0,dllthomas,,,"""Measurements of CPI during that time point are of more questionable accuracy""<p>I am not sure what you mean here - ""of more questionable accuracy [than CPI measurements today]"", or ""of more questionable accuracy [than gold in reflecting the cost of producing a coke]""?  If the former, I grant it, but not (automatically) that it's enough to make a difference.  The latter seems absurd - as I elaborate on a bit below.<p>""CPI measures many different types of goods (not all go up together)""<p>Coke is made out of many different types of goods (in terms of everything it takes to put a bottle on a store shelf), plus labor of people who want to buy many different types of goods.  CPI should be expected to track the cost of producing a coke quite a bit better than a single commodity that isn't even involved in the manufacture and which experienced changes in supply that had nothing to do with coke.<p>""[A] doubling of CPI over that many years is relatively low inflation.""<p>Relatively low, but not absurdly low, and certainly not completely flat; and note (!) that the end points picked here are not representative.  1930 CPI is the start of the depression; inflation in the 1920s was higher than anything we've seen since (says wolfram alpha) and the price of coke did not move.<p>To the general, implied counterfactual - ""would Coke have raised it's prices sooner if there were much higher inflation?"" - I think we have to answer ""of course"", but that doesn't necessarily mean that unusually low inflation was a significant part of it.  Earlier periods have experienced less inflation, but coke's price lasted an unusually long time.",1353006070

9743502,comment,9742331,9742988,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Because the EFF is misleading readers about how the US legal system works. How is it bad that the media companies are drafting the orders? They are parties to the case. The other side is also drafting orders and then the court picks whichever one has the better legal argument.<p>Suppose you get in a dispute with someone. You got to court asking that the court order the other person to stop doing something, or to hand over the money they owe you, or do whatever it is you think they should do that made you sue them. The judge will tell your lawyer to draft the order that you (the client) would like the judge to sign. How do you think the defenedant will feel about this if you win the case? &#x27;OMG it was so unfair, the order was actually written by fenomas&#x27; lawyer and all the judge did was rubber-stamp it, what has our justice system come to etc. etc. etc.&#x27;...unless the dispute goes int eh defendant&#x27;s favor in which case you&#x27;ll probably say the same thing about the defendant&#x27;s lawyer writing the motion that the judge signed off on.<p>This is the normal operation of our adversarial legal system. the EFF should be using their position to educate people about that and then explaining where they disagree with the <i>merits</i> of the media companies&#x27; arguments, instead of pretending that there is some sort of procedural sleight-of-hand going on. After all, when the EFF goes to court the EFF&#x27;s lawyers submit the motions that they would like the judges to sign, just like in any other dispute.",1434700782

9743500,comment,9738482,9743400,0,0,Udo,,,"This fits in nicely with the general narrative. At one point they portray this guy who they say cost the NASA JPL half a million dollars, whereas <i>he</i> said he merely hacked their email server and asked for a job. My suspicion is that hacking damages are stated in &quot;cop dollars&quot;, a wildly arbitrary unit of non-currency. Worth mentioning in this context is also the guy who complains about sitting in a max sec prison for hacking Hillary Clinton&#x27;s email account, a judicial measure the reporters justify by claiming the damage was so great it plagues Clinton still in the 2016 presidential campaign.<p>I think this is mostly a social failure. You have this group of moderately skilled young people who do this basically to make ends meet. The majority of them would probably rather take job offers from the companies they compromise.<p>However, the film also details a lot of low-skill, traditional wire fraud like eBay scamming - which is tangentially related because it&#x27;s also computer-enabled crime, but happens on an entirely different level that has nothing to do with hacking at all.<p>The most obnoxious part of the film for me were the priest&#x27;s soundbites, especially the thing with the bees. Less than nothing was accomplished by adding these weird religious statements to something that is apparently supposed to be a documentary.",1434700762

9743484,comment,9742899,9742899,0,0,madflame991,,,"&quot;I&#x27;d spend a month or two immersing myself in the technical, in the algorithms, in the memorization, and in the process push aside my creative and experimental tendencies.&quot;<p>Memorization is certainly not the way to learn how to solve math/cs/logic problems. There&#x27;s a lot of thinking and (creative) experimentation involved when trying to solve a problem.<p>A lot of problems are classic problems in disguise. You&#x27;d be amazed to find out how many problems are just sorting + one traversal: reducing the average wait time in a queue, convex hull, counting duplicate elements (no extra space), interval scheduling, maximum number of overlapping intervals and a ton more. Can you memorize all of these problems individually? No, but you can ask yourself &quot;how about if I sort my data first, what then?&quot;. If that doesn&#x27;t work then try another question: &quot;I have this brute force algorithm, if I use some other data structure will it get better?&quot; - that question alone solves half of the problems I&#x27;ve ever seen. Follow up questions would be &quot;does my problem look fractal-y?, maybe I can divide it repeatedly&quot; or &quot;can I incrementally build the solution?&quot;<p>Even more interesting is that problems usually have more than one optimal solution: Prim&#x27;s algorithms and Kruskal&#x27;s solve the same problem in opposite-ish ways and use different data structs. How about substring searching: Boyer- Moore searches backwards, Rabin Karp computes hashes while others simulate automata. With self-adjusting binary trees it&#x27;s the same story: a lot of very diverse solutions to the same problem.<p>Solving problems implies doing a lot of permutations and experimenting with data structures and classic approaches if you ask me - it&#x27;s certainly not about memorising more than &quot;sorting sorts and hash tables have constant-ish access time&quot;<p>Is this process any different than changing colors, fonts and layout on a website until you get a good-looking enough whole? All you have to know are some principles about contrast, alignment, spacing and what not, and the rest is experimentation.",1434700339

9743460,comment,9741303,9741303,0,0,crdb,,,"I used to (and, a few years ago, turned away smart people who failed them), but realized they were the wrong test for a small company. I switched initially to getting people to complete a task in their own time with the resources they liked and send us the code, and now entirely on network (i.e. who our CTO has already worked with and knows).<p>Big companies can&#x27;t afford that luxury though. If big companies set tasks, the tasks would eventually leak because of the sheer number of people applying (both per position and over time). By necessity, you need the same task for all candidates to compare them effectively (ours was &quot;build an inventory management system in Haskell for shoes&quot;, and we checked for things like documenting code, error management, and the sensible shortcuts someone might take), so you can&#x27;t switch tasks around, and people will eventually learn what you like, work hard at faking the knowledge (e.g. copying and lightly modifying the code from other applicants), and you&#x27;ll get loads of false positives.<p>So a big company needs to find relatively generalist questions that correlate roughly with later performance, and it seems that whiteboard CS questions are those by testing existing knowledge; through the sheer breadth of the exercise, it&#x27;s a lot more time consuming to &quot;revise&quot; to fake that knowledge, and harder when on the spot to prove understanding. Are algorithm (and, less often mentioned, &quot;fit&quot;) questions relevant to the job, maybe not, but you have to see the context and the hiring problem facing Microsoft or Google.<p>Of course, my opinion is that smaller companies asking whiteboard questions are just aping what they know from Google (as I was) and that there are better ways to hire when you have only 10 employees and 2 openings, but I might be wrong or at a local optimum.<p>I certainly regret not hiring a certain Masters in Statistics from Columbia who was very competent but who wasn&#x27;t familiar with neural nets and admitted so in the interview/whiteboard... she&#x27;d have saved me at least 3 months on things I had to build later!

So simply because a group can be clustered by one trait there is no reason to expect they will differ from the population average in others.<p>For example, if you were to sort the population the length of their pinky finger, and then look at two groups of people, one the longest-pinky quintile and one the shortest, there is nothing in this study that would suggest those two groups would have different resting heart rates. This is true even though we can assume on the basis of this work that both pinky length and resting heart rate are about 50% heritable.<p>The only way they would be correlated would be if there was a single selection mechanism for both, and given that visible traits and non-visible traits tend to have completely different selection mechinisms you&#x27;d have to show positively and directly by experiment that such a common mechanism existed in any given case.<p>Ab initio there is simply no basis for the claim any random non-visible traits like resting heart rate will have different group averages for groups that are segregated from the general population by any random visible characteristics like pinky length.",1434699603

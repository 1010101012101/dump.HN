1082430,comment,1082153,1082330,0,0,cloudkj,,,"I've always run with toe first, even though I don't go barefoot. It wasn't until I finished the book ""Born to Run"" that I realized so many people run with heel first. It just looks non-intuitive and inefficient. The most straightforward transition from a walk to a sprint is to explode on your toes. I really don't understand the heel first running style.<p>For most field sports athletes, I think it's a pretty natural form as well. For any sport requiring pivoting, cutting, and rotating (soccer, basketball, football, etc) explosiveness is key. I can't think of any activity where heel first running would work, except for really light jogging or power walking.<p>The high incidence of knee (or other) injuries in some sports isn't really related to running form either. Most of them are a result of trauma, such as landing awkwardly or physical contact. Toe first versus heel first doesn't really matter there, except for the stronger muscles that the former form may build. Running toe first will reduce the chance of injury from persistent strain put on the lower body as a result of long-form running, since it happens repeatedly over a long period of time.",1264636526

But it also says a lot about Apple and the processor industry:<p>* Apple predicts that sales will be high enough to justify building an iPad-specific processor. I assume nobody outside of Apple will get to use the A4 or derivative chips.<p>* Apple feels that there was no external vendor that could cost-effectively get the exact power-performance trade-off they wanted for the suite of applications that they want to optimize.<p>* Tempering the previous point, this may be a net loss in the case of the iPad alone in terms of pure costs versus going with an external vendor, BUT they now have much better negotiating power for all their other processor purchases from Intel, Samsung, ARM, etc. They can always threaten to roll their own. So even if they lose some money on the A4, they may be in a better position overall<p>* EDIT: Let me also add that despite what some people are claiming this is likely NOT an ARM, but based on PA Semi's power-efficient flavor of the Power architecture. I believe the Power architecture is in the same family as the Motorola PowerPCs that Apple formerly used and dumped for Intel because of the PowerPC's lower power-efficiency.",1264635354

The government deficit has recently gone back up to levels it was at in the 80's and 90's. The domestic economy is skewed toward scamming investors into buying resources that may or may not be accessible.  Following the US lead, housing prices somewhat collapsed and are mostly flat now.  Unemployment numbers are unreliable as the numbers do not really reflect the numbers of people out of work.  The city of Vancouver for instance has about 1200 homeless people but homeless people are not counted amongst the unemployed.<p>Our banking system is similar to the United States where the government borrows money as debt.  In Canada, the government borrows debt money from private Canadian chartered banks that create the money virtually out of thin air.  With the beauty of compound interest the government has paid out over $1.5 trillion dollars in interest alone.  Most of our deficit and spending goes towards merely making payments on the interest to the private banks.

If I'm busy testing every single edge case I can think of, who's doing the development? With separate testers, you get the benefit of concurrency (the software can continue being tested while issues from the previous version are fixed), and subsequently more software developed.<p>""The problem is the cycle is too long. Fix that.""<p>How so? What if I'm developing a new product that has a full specification and design document, and is expected to meet customer acceptance goals? I don't see a deficiency in the development cycle if I need someone else to help test my software in a manner that I simply don't have time for.<p>Does your assertion mean that any software that contains bugs is caused by lack of programmer skill? I, too, would like to learn the secret to writing completely issue-free code if you're willing to share it.<p>Now, please don't take what I say to mean programmers shouldn't test their own creations.

There's a <i>big</i> difference, <i>huge</i> difference between ""can barely"" and ""does it really fucking well"". The iPad shoots for the latter (we'll see if it hits), the netbook's mere existence is predicated on the former.<p>If your definition of ""can do the same"" means ""someone willing to bang their head hard enough and willing to live with a substandard user experience can do it"", sure. But IMHO we need to strive for a higher standard than <i>that</i>.<p>After the iPod, the Mac, and the iPhone, I don't think geeks still get why Apple is successful: they build devices that <i>normal people</i> actually want. I think there is some collective head-in-the-sand in the geek community because what people apparently want is not at all like what geeks want. The average user doesn't <i>want</i> freedom, doesn't want an open kernel, doesn't give a shit about standards, they want to have a slick, usable, and intuitive user experience, and so far netbooks are failing hard at it.<p>The average user doesn't <i>want</i> the ability to hunt down zip files on obscure websites, downloading the file, and being able to run whatever app is inside. They <i>like</i> having a central place where all apps in the universe reside. This may or may not be good for the industry as a whole, but it <i>is</i> what our users desire.<p>IMHO the constant spec-based wankery is why nobody has yet caught up with Apple. I'm seeing a lot of internet chatter about how netbooks do more (does more, poorly), how the cost is too high, how the CPU is too slow, blah blah blah, but conveniently ignores what is IMHO the <i>one</i> defining reason Apple has succeeded in the last decade: user interface.<p>""My Android phone isn't locked down!"" <-- Your Android phone also crashes all the time, emits strange cryptic messages that only developers understand (""a process has been forced to exit""?)",1264633541

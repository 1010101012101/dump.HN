So if you do the homework, you will know how to do the exam. It sucks, some of it won't make sense for ages, I honestly didn't understand what the limit definition of a derivative actually meant until 2 years after I got an A in calc.<p>Some really good advice, hang out with people you know are smarter than you. They will get off on flaunting their intellect, and you'll get taught by some truly brilliant people... everyone wins?<p>Finally try and have fun. I found a strong positive correlation between having fun and my performance in my undergrad.",1267779558

All the servers are already running in standby in the backup data center.<p>The only thing tricky is to hold all writes on backup, and flush all pending updates from primary to backup.  That they did: they made backup in readonly mode, and slowly turned on read/write after a while.<p>I don't understand why they lost so much data.  0.00002% is a lot considering the dataset is really large.  Shouldn't there be replication from primary to backup?  I assume Google is rich enough to have multiple links and fatpipes.",1267778699

Political campaigns and non-profits would love it for fundraisers.  I ran a Congressional campaign and something like this would have been great.<p>I also now a bunch of people in the music/event promotion business locally that would be the perfect fit for this kind of app.<p>Some of the issues I think of at first glance for this kind of app regard around the physical ticket.<p>The process of selling the ticket digitally is simple enough but, getting actual physical tickets that work at the door is another task; especially if you take into consideration fraud prevention and some sort of pos mechanism(QR Codes by phone??) to verify the ticket in the case of larger events.<p>I'm surprised no one in the online tickets space is making a move to integrate the Facebook platform into their current ticketing offerings. Or are they?<p>I've got experience with events through politics, music, and some work on a web app for handling event registration for car shows on a car enthusiast social network.

1169058,comment,1168493,1168493,0,0,ww520,,,"Good to hear Google being open about the problem.  Couple things:<p>- Doesn't each server has its own UPS?  I thought some guy from Google showing the machine design with the battery pack attached to each machine.  Why did a data center power outage crash 25% of the machines at the same time?<p>- Should the servers be restarted and recovered automatically?  It said 25% of servers didn't get the UPS power in time and crashed.  That implied power was restored shortly and the servers can just be restarted.  The servers are just dumb servers that can be shut down, restarted, and recovered in any time.  If enough servers were restarted, then BigTable/DataStore would have enough data nodes to continue.  The downtime would be couple minutes to tens of minutes.<p>- Lack of precise monitoring.  The first clue of problem was as drop in traffic and outside discussion group posts.  Drop-in traffic can be caused by so many things.  Shouldn't there be health check monitors on the BigTable and DataStore clusters?  Like if more than 10% (25% in this case) of nodes in the clusters are down, raise an alarm and page someone right the way?<p>- Were there capacity planning and stress testing to determine what percentage of the capacity that can serve traffic in each DC and each cluster?  25% servers down affecting the whole BigTable cluster sounds too little of safety margin.<p>I don't envy the on-call staff.  The pressure must be tremendous.",1267777981

This ""old-style programming"" is called procedural programming, but even that paradigm had capabilities to implement algorithms. This is the computer science aspect of programming. Actually, it's not an aspect at all, it's the foundation of programming.<p>No, programming is a result of mixing math and linguistics to achieve information processing. Of course that's my inexperience evaluation and I bet a veteran of this field would quickly tell me that I too have an incorrect notion. But see, that's the thing. It shouldn't be this hard to comprehend!

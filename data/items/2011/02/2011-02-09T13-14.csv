2197357,comment,2195520,2197229,0,0,roel_v,,,"I googled a bit, but can't find any numbers any more. I thought I remembered a few 'studies' (I'm using this very lightly, this included self-reported sales numbers from manufacturers and blog posts from industry watchers with estimates) mentioned last fall. All I can find now is how many more average purchases iPhone users make (compared to Android), but that doesn't say anything about the shape of the curve of course - if iPhone users are overall equally likely to buy apps, and only 10% of the most hardcore Android users buy the same amount, the average for Android is down, but with a lot of users not buying (this is my assertion, like I said I can't back this up with credible numbers).<p>Anyway, my main point is that 'twitter' is something most users have only heard from on TV and don't even know what it is. For a regular user, a phone works when you can make phone calls with it, send text messages and set reminders/use it as an (alarm) clock. Then there are fancy features like using it for navigation (which is something they're already familiar with from standalone devices), contact/full agenda sync, and password management; and reading news sites; and post on facebook when they're so bored out of their mind that they really don't know what else to do.<p>And then there's the uber-advanced, only-nerds-do-this, full phone-centered lifestyle, where as much as possible is automated through phone apps. This is where twitter-client downloading people fall into - web nerds, turtle-neck wearing marketing people and art students. Of course in absolute numbers this is still a sizeable market, but it's only a fraction of the overall 'mobile phone' customer base. It will become more main stream in time, but not now...<p>How many OS projects are really used? A couple of hundred users, a couple of thousands for popular custom android roms?

While I did mostly general touristic stuff, I added some geeky points of interest to my itinerary such as Bletchley Park, Alexander Fleming's lab and planned to attend a StackOverflow conference. Meeting fellow programmers is always fun.<p>Now, I'm an Hebrew speaker, but speak English fairly well.<p>After about 3 to 4 days I made the ""switch"" and generally thought in English and spoke pretty fluently.<p>Towards the end of the trip (after about 20 days) I went to the StackOverflow conference, where I saw two of my programming idols, Jeff and Joel.
At some point at the conference I approached the couple and we started to chat. Now, I hate to admit this, but bear in mind I was as ecstatic as a little girl meeting Justin Bieber in person. I was about 22 at the time and liked a lot of what they wrote on their blogs.<p>I know that generally people feel pressured when being treated as ""idols"" and these days I'm much better about these things, but at the time I couldn't help myself.
All of this lead to me ""forgetting"" some of the English and (what I felt was) a much less fluent conversation, on my part.
To make things more ironic Joel tried some Hebrew with me and I insisted to speak in English (which was a bit broken due to anxiety).
After 20 days in English speaking countries it just felt too awkward for me to speak in Hebrew. Maybe it was awkward for me to speak in a language foreign to the rest of the group or just the anxiety that kicked in and I'm making too much of it. I don't know.<p>Why ironic?  Here I was, a native Hebrew speaker from Israel, unable to speak in my native tongue while a former Israeli, practically his entire life living in the states, tries to speak with me in Hebrew and unable to.<p>I'm not sure if it's a matter of plain capability. When thinking about programming I can think simultaneously about how to express an idea in different programming languages/paradigms. This is another point of interest, how is thinking in other languages compares to thinking in different programming languages.<p>tl;dr: It seems to me there is more to the switching metaphor than developed in the article. When getting into the flow of a language it may be harder to operate in a different one. Moreover, as programmers we are all too familiar with thinking in different programming languages and it's interesting to see how it all relates.",1297258520

So, on the one hand, I agree with you that every dollar should be invested for maximum return, and it doesnt matter where it came from, but on the other hand, there are decisions to be made about going out and getting more capital above and beyond your retained earnings (i.e. debt or equity financing).  That money comes at a much higher price, so the return on it has to justify the cost.<p>To put it in terms of an individual rather than a company, the decision to take out a mortgage to buy a house is connected but somewhat different than the decision of where to spend or invest your salary dollars.  The mortgage is a loan that comes at a cost (the annual interest), yet it enables you to do something (buy a house)that you could not have done out of your earnings.

9556098,comment,9553168,9553168,0,0,rambulator,,,"Mathematica is adequate for prototyping or detailed Science/Engineering etc analysis provided datasets aren&#x27;t large and the codebase is small.<p>Mathematica is very fast for your initial development, but you run into massive bottlenecks when you jump from your small test cases to real world data. In other words you get something up and running quickly, then spend a massive amount of time manually (there is no proper debug environment) debugging edge cases and trying to optimize it for real world cases. The time savings aren&#x27;t really there for many projects, as you end up spending more time than if you had used something like C++.<p>The last version of Mathematica (v10) was released over a year ago without an update to the Eclipse plugin, making an already pretty archaic development experience impossible.<p>The front end debugger isn&#x27;t a &#x27;fair&#x27; debugger. When it works (which isn&#x27;t often) you are limiting to only running through small code snippets as its impossible to trace anything.<p>There is no profiler.<p>The number of builtin functions is huge but many are effectively deprecated in terms of their performance or existing bugs. Many of the functions like Map (/@) aren&#x27;t optimized. The irony is that once you have optimized your code it ends up looking like that from any other language i.e. you have moved a lot of  Wolfram&#x27;s high end functions.<p>I totally agree with others comments that code re-use is really difficult. Many of Wolfram&#x27;s comparisons compare code size with code complexity. Its not always to the case, but 20 lines of Wolfram language can often be very difficult to trace and understand.<p>Access to curated data is nice, but in many cases there is no information on the accuracy or tolerances for data and it has been truncated (rounded to the point of irrelevancy) or is missing elements. So like anything you still need to verify it or access it directly from other sources. Things like units cannot be used in functions/loops as it slows runtime to a crawl.<p>But horses for courses, the language is exciting for small projects and maybe a jumping off point for people moving into full development of something.<p>One of the biggest issues facing Mathematica is simply that Wolfram Research&#x27;s focus is no longer Science and Engineering but rather the Internet of Things.",1431784651

I wonder if we&#x27;ll even be able to have a discussion about this without me getting downvoted into oblivion.<p>Asians have the highest GPAs and SAT scores, followed by whites, followed by Hispanics, followed by blacks. As such, blacks are given the benefit of the doubt, where as Asians are judged more harshly.<p>Statistically, these groups have differing average IQs in the same order that I just described, with Asians at the top (actually Ashkenazi Jews at the top, followed by Asians) and blacks, sadly, at the bottom. This isn&#x27;t to say a black individual can&#x27;t have a high IQ or an Asian individual can&#x27;t have a low IQ, just that on average they cluster around certain numbers, so a black with genius-level IQ is rarer than an Asian one.<p>Whether or not you believe IQ measures intelligence accurately or comprehensively, the fact is that it correlates strongly with academic performance and SAT scores. I also will concede that &quot;race&quot; has questionable biological validity, and it gets really fuzzy when one is the offspring of one or more &quot;mixed-race&quot; parents&quot;. Still, race/IQ statistics in all of their generalities are a source of existential depression for me. Most of the data is touted boldly by people I despise and used to bolster viewpoints that I find deplorable, but there seems to be at least some truth to it.<p>The idea of discriminating based on one&#x27;s race seems unfair if we lived in a world where literally everyone has the same capacity to succeed but merely chooses not to. But what if that&#x27;s not the case? If Asians generally can attain high test scores and high GPAs due to an innate advantage, could that mean the admissions standards <i>should</i> be stricter for them and more lax for other groups? The alternative is that certain groups completely dominate academia with ease, while other groups are barely represented at all -- which is probably already the case to a large extent.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are any easy answers. Trouble arises with an Asian individual with a relatively &quot;average&quot; IQ faces the admissions process, and trouble arises because the black individuals who manage to get in have above-average IQs. Still, I support the <i>idea</i> of affirmative action for the reasons that I previously described.<p>Asians might have a harder time while other groups get a bit of a head start, but if you have a high IQ you will ultimately have the capacity to carve out a high-paying career in ways that someone with a relatively lower IQ never will.",1431783223

Modern three-blade wind turbines reach 75-80% of the theoretical maximum, across the entire area their rotors sweep out.[1]<p>That&#x27;s why the classic windmill design is so classic: its efficiency scales with the <i>square</i> of the length of the rotors.

I went to a high school that, while it wasn&#x27;t the greatest in my county, routinely sent a student to Harvard every year - it was one of those schools that Harvard & other Ivy League schools tended to cherry-pick its minorities from (over 70% black/hispanic I was told the statistics were, in one of the wealthiest counties in the US).<p>I had extremely strong credentials overall - generally strong standardized testing scores (1250 on the SAT in 7th grade with a 740 Math/510 Verbal split, 800 on the SAT II Math 2C in 8th grade, 780 SAT II Biology, 780 SAT II Physics, 750 SAT II Chemistry, 750 SAT II Writing, 1450 on the regular SAT with a 750 Math/700 Verbal split), college math & physics credits while in high school (Calculus III/Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, etc.), lots of extracurriculars & achievements, and a recommendation from an Ivy League physics professor. However, I slipped up on my essay since I wasn&#x27;t a good writer then (which clicked for me the summer before college strangely enough) - that slip up was all it took to get deferred rejection from schools like Harvard in a year where a lot of the private colleges were weakened by the Enron scandal & consequently took 3/4th of the normal enrollment.<p>On the flip side, in just the class before mine, there was a girl who had nowhere near my scores or achievements (in fact, I heard her SAT score was a 1320) who was accepted to Harvard - the kicker was that she was half latino.<p>At the time this happened, I was extremely angry/bitter - I ended up attending a public university, which ended up being a blessing in many ways. I ended up learning a lot in non-academic aspects, but a lot of that was from force of character as someone who pushes himself to break barriers and challenge himself to succeed on difficult situations. I still believe those schools made a bad mistake, but I&#x27;ve accepted that admission is not necessarily a merit based decision for these schools, and to concern myself with what I can control.",1431782073

The popular belief is every human brain starts as a blank slate with unlimited capability.  By that logic, if you don&#x27;t get accepted somewhere, it&#x27;s your own damn fault.  But, that&#x27;s so obviously wrong.  I know plenty of people who are physically smarter than me.  In certain problem-solving capacities, they think faster, better, and in more immediately creative ways than I do (what I lack in immediate ability I make up for in long-term effort).  And so do their siblings and their parents and their grandparents going back many many years.

A popular solution to the &quot;too many high achieving people from the same background&quot; bugaboo is to try and make the minorities less minority by boosting their numbers though allowing sub-perfect acceptance (not sub-par, just sub-not-the-absolute-best-ever).  But, you have a fixed resource to allocate (class sizes, dorm rooms), so that kicks out some of the (glut) of perfect achievers you would have otherwise accepted.<p>Then it comes down to politics.

Across several books, Weber details how first the SD(P) project, and then Project Apollo, result in a massive qualitative improvement of Manticoran weapons, such that their navy becomes the most powerful in known space despite its relatively small size.<p>On the second hand, if the attack you mean is &quot;Oyster Bay&quot;, then Weber&#x27;s at some pains to make clear that, while the current stock of missiles is sufficient to defeat <i>one</i> major attack on the scale of Filareta&#x27;s, the wholesale devastation of Manticore&#x27;s military manufacturing capabilities will result in a severe force imbalance against any further such attacks, and the sheer size of the Solarian League&#x27;s navy will come to count for much more than their units&#x27; individual weakness against Manticoran ships -- a weakness largely predicated on qualitative differences in missile capabilities, which ceases to be an advantage when Manticoran ships&#x27; magazines can&#x27;t be reloaded.<p>Granted, the end of <i>Mission of Honor</i> and the events of <i>A Rising Thunder</i> make clear that the manufacturing deficit isn&#x27;t going to end up being the fatal blow to Manticore that it initially appears to be.

He&#x27;s done a better job of taking to heart that criticism since he accepted that the series is no longer one which can be picked up and started from any book. For I think the same reason, he&#x27;s also started allowing the reader to infer the actual events of a given battle, choosing to spend words on its prelude and ramifications rather than spewing monotonous chapters on battles whose details are a foregone conclusion.<p>Not to say, of course, that Weber as an author is beyond reproach -- nothing of the sort.

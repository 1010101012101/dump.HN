They might trust it with their most personal data, or vital business documents.  But, it is still a toy.<p>If I build a toy bridge no-one tries to make it span the grand canyon.  They see it for what it is - its faults are obvious.  They try to cross my toy bridge and it easily collapses under the weight of their foot without costing the lives of anyone.  And, if they somehow managed to string along my toy to the point where it could span the grand canyon, do you think anyone in their right mind would find me liable as the toy maker?<p>Ultimately, this is where the differences are huge.  People are building toy bridges, pet bridges, foot bridges, bridges for single cars and bridges for 10 lanes of traffic.  It&#x27;s very difficult to accidentally substitute a bridge built for 1 person into a spot you need a bridge for 10 lanes of traffic.<p>But it&#x27;s trivial in software to put a &quot;toy bridge&quot; or &quot;pet bridge&quot; where you need something like the golden gate bridge.<p>So, when someone takes my toy and tries to use it as the golden gate bridge, whose at fault?",1421380681

The site was restored on the same\n    day.\n\n    The binaries of this edition are on another server and they are\n    not compromised (the SHA1 published on 11th January 2015 is always\n    available on SF). The automatic typing in Notepad++ &quot;Je suis\n    Charlie&quot; edition after installation is a feature.\n\n    The message of the defacement accused Notepad++ of inciting hatred\n    towards Islam and accusing Islam of supporting terrorism. The\n    statements of Notepad++ &quot;Je suis Charlie&quot; edition support nothing\n    but the freedom of expression and only that. The fact of Notepad++\n    supporting the &quot;Je suis Charlie&quot; movement has nothing to do with\n    any accusation towards a specific community. In fact the &quot;Je suis\n    Charlie&quot; movement in France, as far as I can tell, deserves no\n    label of racism or of Islamophobia. I have many Muslim friends who\n    are for &quot;Je suis Charlie&quot;. And sincerely, I don&#x27;t think that two\n    extremist fools can stand for all Muslims or Islam itself.\n\n    If you don&#x27;t like &quot;Je suis Charlie&quot; edition, that&#x27;s fine. You can\n    still use Notepad++ v6.7.3 - they are the same in terms of\n    features and bug fixes. notepad-plus-plus.org could be hacked over\n    and over again, but I will always find a way to distribute\n    Notepad++ &quot;Je suis Charlie&quot; edition - that&#x27;s my freedom of\n    expression which I claim as my right.</code></pre>",1421380414

They do not generally turn on a dime (and even though they &quot;can&quot;, it is still a rare event, and uncontrollable when it happens). But second of all, look back over the past 50 years and consider what motion there has been. There&#x27;s been a lot. It is well known we are prone to overestimate the short-term impact of things, and underestimate the long-term impact. People have changed, people <i>will</i> change, and as the entire system evolves it&#x27;s a perfectly viable outcome that, yes, things get worse for a while but people actually <i>respond</i> to that and make things better. This theory is bolstered by the fact that you can look back over the past 50 years and see concrete examples of this happening.<p>As much as some people would love to tell you otherwise, no, massive chaos and death as a result of ecosystem &quot;collapse&quot; (itself a rather deceptive term, there is no such atomic event) are <i>not</i> inevitable, and making decisions based on that assumption carry the grave risk of being totally wrong.",1421379431

It could be incorrect attitude landing (e.g. tilted) or anything else.  In this case it looks like it was exactly that: landed tilted or with significant horizontal speed.  If it was high vertical speed, we would&#x27;ve seen big scrapes on the platform&#x27;s surface, and there&#x27;s none.<p>Contrary to popular belief, the fins are _extremely_ effective even at low speeds.  First, they have enormous surface area.  Secondly, they have huge momentum around the center of mass, which is at the very bottom of the rocket when it&#x27;s empty.  So, even a small force generated by the fins generates huge momentum and can help position the rocket in the desired attitude.<p>It looks like the control system was commanding the fins to move and was expecting the attitude to change, but they didn&#x27;t move anymore.  Perhaps at the very end of the flight the gimbals on the engine didn&#x27;t have enough authority to orient the rocket vertically and/or arrest its horizontal speed.<p>I think it&#x27;s amazing achievement for the very first attempt.

Pinning could be used to eliminate CAs (as most people initially expect) but this isn&#x27;t viable at the moment. The specification, which proposes a method to validate the certificate chain, also accomplishes very little: it&#x27;s fully vulnerable to MITM attacks on the first client connection. There are also privacy concerns about storing pinning data; and a browser which is configured to clear all data at exit would not see any benefit.<p>It&#x27;s also wrong to say that public key pinning (which addresses PKI/TLS weaknesses) makes DNSSEC redundant. I suppose the proper comparison would be to the (optional) DANE?",1421377784

I&#x27;m hoping that it will prove possible to make economically viable replacements for a lot of the more damaging parts of our civilization.

Whether these things will work is an open question so far, but I do think there&#x27;s reason for hope.<p>As far as humanity waking up, I think it&#x27;s more productive to think in terms of <i>how much</i> of humanity is awake since that gives us a measurable quantity that we can actually influence. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll be able to present people with a solution that actually works and doesn&#x27;t require big action from on-high.

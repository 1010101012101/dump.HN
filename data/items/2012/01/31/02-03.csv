So, I'll give you some ideas, but be warned, some of these may seem a little wacky.<p>1. Do something that scares you. I just signed up to go ice climbing in the Rocky Mountains, despite the fact that ice climbing scares the crap out of me. Worst case scenario, something unfortunate happens and my last words are, ""I should have bought stocccckkkkksssss."" Best case scenario, I learn something valuable about myself and how I deal with fear. From past experience, learning about fear is extremely useful...<p>2. Launch something. Get yourself some server space, build an MVP and launch something. Chances are that nobody will ever hear about (or use) your creation and you'll lose money. But, you'll learn way more than you would if you did an MBA.<p>3. Find a charity and donate your money (and your time). Not only does doing this feel good, but you'd be surprised the contacts you can gain by working with a good not for profit. I'd argue that getting involved with charities is the most effective hack I've ever embarked upon. It certainly has the highest ROI of anything I have ever done.<p>4. Go to a conference. Find a conference that interests you. Go. Make a point of meeting five new people per day. Have fun.<p>5. Take a class in a subject you find rather useless. Back in the mythical day, I took a painting class. That doesn't sound too admirable, but I don't have an artistic bone in my body.

3531478,comment,3531172,3531373,3,0,joebadmo,,,"SPYW certainly seems like the only real, new issue. It seems to me like a clear case of sacrificing a product's short-term quality for long-term quality. I.e. diverting as much traffic as possible to G+ will drive up usage, which will give Google more data on which to optimize search results.<p>It strikes me as analogous to Apple's move from OS9 to OSX. OSX performed poorly at first, but it was a necessary if painful infrastructure change for the sake of the product's future.<p>Another reason I'm not worried is that Google's only lock-in is search quality. If a challenger appears and really does perform better for searches, then people will eventually shift over. I think this is ultimately what will keep Google from going completely off the rails vis-a-vis search.<p>Conversely, I think it's what allows Facebook to get away with a lot. Its lock-in feature is ubiquity/network-effect, which is at best orthogonal to quality of product.",1327975851

Instead of getting a cavity filled for $150, I ended up needing a $1000 root canal.  But even then, not that expensive.

I had just jumped onto a team in the middle of an enormous shift in product and put the nagging, on-and-off pain on the back burner with some aspirin and made a dentist's appointment a few days out.<p>After I woke up on Wednesday with the worst headache of my life looking just like that first photo, I went to my oral surgeon, who sent me in for emergency surgery immediately. I spent a night in the ICU and three days recovering. He explained that I had developed a serious abscess that had spilled into my palate and threatened to close my windpipe completely, and that if I hadn't come in I probably wouldn't have made it to the weekend.<p>It was an extremely sobering look at my priorities and good luck. I was young, and health insurance hadn't been a priority - had I been bootstrapping or freelancing instead of a part of a team with the good sense to get a group health insurance policy, I might have dug myself into about $40,000 in debt, or worse - hesitated to go to the doctor's for even longer.<p>Don't fuck around with your health. I dodged a bullet. It's tempting to push these responsibilities off like any other, but like other commentors said, it runs directly contrary to your duty to be healthy and present for your team.

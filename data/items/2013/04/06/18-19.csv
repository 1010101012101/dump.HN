For some reason you seem to have unrealistic expectations here. If you're prepared to do the work to fix it, then you'll be heard. If you're not, then you'll only hear echoes of yourself complaining that the problem isn't being fixed.<p>If Ubuntu has introduced a patch over Debian or upstream, there's usually a reason for it. Here, it looks like it's adding some kind of useful functionality for standalone users.<p>> and some of them like two major MySQL issues I raised on an LTS release are unresolved after 3 years even though we were paid landscape and supported users<p>MySQL is a particularly sore point. Upstream (Oracle) have a closed VCS and bug tracker. There's very little that can be done about MySQL issues except to wait for Oracle to fix them. Slackware and Arch have already moved away from MySQL for this reason. If you have a packaging issue, then Ubuntu in time inherits whatever Debian's packaging have done there. There's little different between Debian and Ubuntu's MySQL packaging (they happen to mostly be looked after by the same person wearing two different hats, anyway).<p>I fail to see how Debian is better here in the general case. Ubuntu inherits most of Debian's goodness. In areas where differs, yes Ubuntu can introduce bugs not present in Debian. But it usually differs in the first place because there is extra functionality available in Ubuntu aimed at the everyday user.<p>Again, I think most of the complaints about Ubuntu are really complaints that the open source world isn't fixing your special issue. Ubuntu just tends to get the flak because it is popular. People have fewer expectations from other distros for some reason, even though they are all based on the same upstream sources.",1365273799

5504497,comment,5504129,5504129,29,0,hkmurakami,,,"I don't disagree with the overal theme of the article, but I have to disagree on some particulars. Some thoughts:<p>>Habit First<p>Absolutely agree, especially when you're trying to get out of morbid out-of-shapeness. I personally find that mixing it into a pre-existing daily routine works well. I personally do core work and pullups/chinups before my morning and evening showers, and stretch exercises while I'm in the shower.<p>>Diet<p>IMO the Diet section is way too detailed as a first step. For someone who is trying to improve from very poor nutrition, I would advise the following:<p>1. Get rid of all processed sugar products from your house: candy, juice, soda, cookies, etc. (imo all processed items are bad, but again it's about keeping the barrier low)<p>2. Only walk around the outside lanes of a Grocery store (where the meats, dairy, and vegetables are). Don't go into the middle aisles where they have all the sugary, salty, processed goodies. Keeping bad food out of the house is the easiest, lowest friction way to keep a healthy diet.<p>> Dumbbells first<p>Totally disagree with this one. Compound lifts using Barbells are vastly superior to isolation lifts using dumbbells, particularly for beginners. And for beginners, Starting Strength has proven time and time again to be the most effective program. [1]<p>If you're ""starting out"", then bodyweight exercises like pullups, chinups, bodyweight squats, planks, pushups, situps, are going to be low barrier to entry, good-habit inducing work that can be leveraged to take the person to the next level when they're comfortable. Once they're at this stage, they can buy whatever barbell setup they're comfortable with (I personally really want an Olympic Lifting platform in my garage...), which is going to be much much cheaper than that complicated Nautilus weight thing anyway.<p>>Safety<p>>Even with dummbells, I was able to put loads on my back that felt uncomfortable within about three months.<p>That' because dumbell lifts don't engage the stabilizer muscles. As a result, those support muscles are going to be underdeveloped and you won't have developed the coordination to engage them when you need them.<p>> Padded lifting gloves with wrist support helped keep my wrists in a stable, safe position and alleviated wrist pain.<p>IMO using outside assistance like this promotes bad form and bad habits.<p>>Str training machines<p>Ugh these machines are terrible. They (a) don't engage your auxiliary muscles well, and (b) move weights in an unnatural path relative to your body and tend to cause more injuries than just plan barbell work. A great example is squatting on a smith machine, which puts you into very dangerous positions. (yet every single small'ish gym believes that they are somehow safer than regular squat racks)<p>---<p>I find it odd that the article started out with the premise of helping very novice people get into a healthier routine wrt both diet and exercise, yet evolved into a fairly intermediate article. IMO most people don't need to optimize strength training to this extent. Just getting in any kind of routine and eating well will go a lonnggggg ways.<p>[1] <a href=""http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/The_Starting_Strength_Novice/Beginner_Programs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/The_Starting_Strength...</a>",1365273044

You seem to be cherry-picking.<p>Also I believe that while your characterization of open-source projects as essentially ego trips may be accurate of some, it is so only of a minority and in any case will not withstand any serious feminist critique.<p>I find that your assumption that only superior software engineers can judge the work of other engineers to be patently false and it sets up a false dichotomy.  That is the same as saying that only other artists can judge artistic merit.  It has no basis in fact or history.

We got a slightly faster iPhone, Facebook did some interface tweaks, Microsoft released a new version of Windows. These seem like really small improvements. But if you look back to the original iPhone, what Facebook looked like in Zuck's dorm room, or what Windows 3.1 looked like, the change is staggering.<p>The linked video shows this phenomenon full effect. The internet in the video is slow, clunky, and ugly. How could a page take 30 seconds to load? Why does everything have a murky gray background? The difference between the web of then and now is staggering. But as someone who grew up through the early 90s watching the internet expand, it sure didn't feel like things were changing fast. It happened gradually - companies starting coming online slowly (and often with a very limited presence): nytimes, barnes+noble, moviefone. Then the internet started getting organized better, first with Yahoo's directories, then with search engines like AltaVista, Excite, Lycos. Then, Google came along, gradually improving their algorithm to the point where we can now access almost any piece of the world's information in seconds. In retrospect, there was so much going on during that time period, but living through it didn't feel that way.<p>More than anything else, I think this is a testament that having a real impact on technology in the long-term is a marathon, not a sprint. You have to have a vision, and incrementally improve on it constantly, even if it feels like you're not accomplishing much in the short term.",1365272710

If you read the text, you will realise that, even if they are really clumsy, the issue here is not so much the DCRI than French law itself.<p>Let's look closely at what is happening : \n1 - The DCRI aks the Wikimedia Fundation to delete an article from Wikipedia because it's infringing article 413-11 of the French penal code.\n2 - The Wikimedia Fundation refuses arguing the order should state which piece of information in the article is classified.\n3 - As the Wikimedia Fundation is an american organisation, the DCRI turns itself towards its French arm, the French Wikimedia and its representative.\n4 - Under pressure, the president complies and removes the article pointing that people putting it back will be breaking the law.<p>Well, actually, he is probably right. While I understand why the Wikimedia Fundation took a stand and refused to remove the article, as silly as it seems, the fact remains : In France, putting classified information online is illegal even you don't know they are classified.<p>Let's look at the article 413-11 : \n<a href=""http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=FB03D025759E0DF0811DDCFEC51257B5.tpdjo17v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020933031&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&dateTexte=20130406&categorieLien=id"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessioni...</a><p>First, this article is aimed at everyone not mentioned in article 413-10. Article 413-10 lists the sanction for people which are legitimately depositary of a state secret. Thus, article 413-11 concerned anyone knowing a state secret without being mandated.<p>Now, there is three points in the article. The first one says that the mere fact of knowing classified information without being mandated is illegal (yes, even by accident). The second one that destroying, stealing or copying such information is illegal (yes, it's unnecessary considering that to do that you have already committed 1). The third (unnecessary too) states that sharing this information with the public is illegal too.<p>So yes, if the Wikipedia article contains classified information, Wikimedia France already broke the law and its legal representative is liable and yes it's laughable.<p>But now, the best part. Do you know why there is so unnecessary part in this law ? \nBecause it was changed in 2009 ! Previously, article 1 only criminalised illegally acquiring classified information, not knowledge of it. But, you nailed it, transforming unknowing citizen into criminals was obviously a necessity to protect us against terrorists and the amendment was passed in a state of general indifference despite some warning from the press (for once).<p>So, if you want to blame someone, blame the French parliament and the French people.

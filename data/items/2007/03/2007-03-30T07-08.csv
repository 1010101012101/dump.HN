Hmm... I think I'll pass.  Sounds like all the useful info is in the title.",1175241509
7525,comment,7501,7501,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I am very happy to see all of these music startups.  My startup idea is one which should help to change the current structure of the music industry for the better, but I'm glad to see that such changes are already happening.  Their funding model in particular is quite clever, one that seems eerily similar to one I read in some paper or article a few months ago, where the writer was suggesting precisely the idea of an art funding model in which fans put money towards bands they like to encourage them to continue producing music.  It's too bad that I can't find it.",1175241335
7523,comment,7517,7521,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That's true, but what was actually measured was the mean time to serve the entire request.  I think in nearly any usage pattern, this would be the data point that you would be most concerned with.  You want users browsing your pages to get their pages and small images very quickly, and if they have to wait a couple seconds for the larger images to finish, or for minutes for large file downloads, that seems to be the kind of behavior a user would expect.<p>What this scheduling algorithm avoids is the case where several people are downloading large files and other more casual users are having a worse browsing experience because of that.",1175239615

This is a nice, quirky, funny presentation for improving server performance.<p>A faculty candidate recently gave a talk at Ohio State about improving server reliability, and I have linked to her paper in the following submission:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=7517"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=7517</a>",1175239411
7521,comment,7517,7518,0,0,xyzzy,,,"I wonder to what extent this is a statistical artifact
rather than a genuine improvement. For example, if you
measure performance as the mean time to serve each kilobyte,
then the proposed scheduler does not increase performance.",1175238980

The first thing I read is company blog(s). You can tell a lot from the blog (SWOT) [2]. The company hierarchy, culture, toolset used, market.

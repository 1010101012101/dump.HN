7795363,comment,7795216,7795216,14,0,rdtsc,,,"You need multiple things to come together. Some are abstract and general, some are more specific. You need to know the tools you are using, the capabilities of your platforms.<p>At some lowest level it is about solving problems and knowing how to drill down and understand requirements, split a large problem into sub-problems. In that respect it is not unlike an architect or an engineer or carpenter.<p>Then it comes to about learning how to translate to an intermediate mental representation. Here where you you already think about the typical language paradigms. Like someone used to object oriented design starts seeing objects, factories, inheritance hierarchies. Someone used to actor based programming (like Erlang) starts seeing actors sending messages to each other. A Haskell programmer starts thinking about type-classes (presumably, I am not one).<p>Then it comes down writing it. Here one needs to know the tools in detail. The specific language, platform, API. Say something object oriented at the higher level could become something in C++, Java or Python here. Here is where Google-ing helps. Knowing that say oh Python has this cool built-in module that can help me. Or yeah, I&#x27;ll use a smart pointer here. Well you have to know about the smart pointers.<p>Then here is boring but important stuff. Knowing how to use version control. Knowing how to estimate time, communicate with team-mates. Not being stupid about security.<p>Anyway a lot of things have to come together to make someone a successful programmer in the general sense. Some acquire these capacities formally by going to college. Some acquire these on their own.<p>The interesting thing is that regardless of how it was acquired, the usual instinct is to discount it while looking back. &quot;Oh I just write Python, here is a book on syntax, learn it and start programming&quot;. That always somehow seems easy to programmers. And I have made the that mistake. Friends and family member I have tried to show/teach programming.",1400990313

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here, but I&#x27;m going to elaborate anyway.<p>Learning to program isn&#x27;t fundamentally about learning what text to type in to a box somewhere. It&#x27;s about learning to think computationally. &quot;Think computationally&quot; is vague and doesn&#x27;t mean very much to the beginner. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s something you need to learn with practice.<p>Think about writing in normal human languages. You could say there are two things going on when you are writing an essay, for example. At one level, you are thinking about the concepts. What are your arguments? How are you going to support them? At another level, you are thinking about how to write them down -- how to encode them in a way that readers will understand.<p>The same distinction exists in programming. At one level, you need to think computationally. What are the inputs I have access to? How can I use them to produce the right outputs? What data structures should I use? How should I handle this edge case? At another level, you are thinking about how to write all of this down so that the computer will actually be able to do it.<p>Copying and pasting will help you with the second part -- figuring out how to write down the structures you come up with -- and real, experienced programmers do that all the time, but it won&#x27;t help you with the first part -- figuring out what structures to write down.",1400990162

Do nothing.  DO.  NOTHING.<p>This amount of money is psychological destabilizing, but even that will be nothing compared to when you are risking it.  You have no idea how you will react if you start losing money (you might increase risk - that&#x27;s how people blow their fortunes).<p>If you&#x27;re really looking for financial freedom, use the cash to take time off a job and start working on your own business.<p>If you are interested in investing because you are interested in investing (unlikely if you haven&#x27;t dabbled in that already), then start small.  Take 25k and start buying stocks or whatever.  Do not go big - it takes years of brutal experience to get even decent at investing.<p>This is life changing money - in other words, your life has already changed.

Jarrell. Capt. Jarrell asked to be allowed to contact the American Consul in the city, but permission was denied. The Russian &quot;Allies&quot; interrogated the American crew for three days trying to obtain operational details about the plane and its capabilities. The crew refused to divulge secret information and after three days of questioning without contact from the American Consul, the crew refused to even speak for a week. On the 11th day after landing, the crew was finally able to speak with the Consulate. Unfortunately, the crew was not released to the consulate and remained prisoners of the Russians for seven months before being released along with about 100 other U.S. Army and Navy fliers forced to land in Russian territory during WWII.<p>The Russians kept the &quot;Ramp Tramp&quot; in spite of American protests, along with three other B-29s that landed on Soviet territory (two made similar emergency landings in Vladivostok and the other crash landed in Siberia). The Tupolov aircraft manufacturer examined the B-29s in minute detail and copied them almost exactly (a fairly remarkable engineering feat). The resulting plane was designated TU-4 (NATO code name BULL). The TU-4 remained the Soviet Union&#x27;s primary long-range bomber until about 1955 when it was phased out in favor of newer types.

Experimental errors and implementation errors in their hamburger menu aside, they were correct to stick with the UI that tested better, even if it defied Android or Apple&#x27;s HIGs in one way or another.<p>Apple compiles and publishes their HIG because they benefit from platform consistency and it helps with branding & learnability, but third party developers don&#x27;t benefit just from following the guidelines.

These products are absolutely riddled with security flaws, but the brands haven&#x27;t caught on yet. I think really understanding why requires a bit of background, which I&#x27;ll attempt to provide:<p>Brands like D-Link solicit stuff from &quot;white label&quot; vendors (who most people will have never heard of); the models they like the best get D-Link branded and get a chance at shelf space around the world. The brands do have input into things like the web interface, enclosure design and/or setup procedures (e.g. WPS button). What the brands do is valuable, but they usually do not have deep insight into how the product actually works or how it&#x27;s developed.<p>The white-label vendors are like artists, trying to produce &quot;hits&quot;, and the major brands are like record labels who can introduce things to a wide audience.<p>Naturally, the brands try to find suppliers who can provide the best features at the lowest hardware cost. The software side is often not looked at very closely.<p>When a researcher reports a vulnerability, this usually goes through the brand. Unfortunately, since they&#x27;re not very technical, the brand tends to mangle the communications to the white-label. The white-label is scrambling to make their upstream customer (i.e. D-Link) happy, not the consumer.  Communications problems are exacerbated when (as quite often happens) the firmware developer at the end of this chain does not have strong english.<p>Finally, in the case where the firmware is riddled with such bugs, it&#x27;s in the interest of the white-label to HIDE this fact from the brand.<p>I think what needs to happen is that D-Link need to have high quality security reviews conducted as part of their vendor / hardware selection process. It&#x27;s likely to happen, but it&#x27;ll take years for the benefits to flow through to consumers.<p>On the Telco side, most places are now putting their home gateways and so on through fairly rigorous security reviews during the selection and deployment process. The hardware vendors are slowly learning embedded security via that route. No-one likes to lose multi-million unit sales.<p>[source: I&#x27;ve worked both in wifi router firmware development and pentesting, including embedded device security reviews].",1400987959

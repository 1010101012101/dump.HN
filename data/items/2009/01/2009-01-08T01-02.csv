Also, say what you will about ESR, his <i>The Art of Unix Programming</i> (<a href=""http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/</a>) explains the rationale behind most of the design ideas common in Unix, as well as various historical accidents that have influenced it. (It more about Unix's design/culture than programming, IMHO.) Plus, free online.<p>In particular, Unix will probably seem really awkward and limited until he really deeply gets the idea of doing things by composing relatively simple programs. There are a few other idioms fundamental to Unix, but that's probably the big one. (That would probably be easier if he had experience with Haskell, incidentally; Unix pipe IO can be very similar to monads.)<p>A general (perhaps very general) understanding of C will also go a <i>long</i> way, particularly with understanding the mindset behind the man pages.",1231379619

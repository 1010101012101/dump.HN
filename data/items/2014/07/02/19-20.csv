7979315,comment,7977417,7979155,3,0,_delirium,,,"> In fact, from my reading of the article, I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking of a case where Google could refuse to delete a link.<p>How about the case discussed right here? The summary linked above says:<p><i>The request may for example be turned down where the search engine operator concludes that for particular reasons, such as for example the public role played by John Smith, the interest of the general public to have access to the information in question justifies showing the links in Google search results.</i><p>That seems like it could be pretty easily satisfied in this case: Stanley O&#x27;Neal is a major business figure with a clear public role, serving on the board that controls gigantic multinational corporation Alcoa. Given that powerful role, it&#x27;s in the interest of the general public to be able to search for and find information about his recent past in positions of power at other gigantic multinational corporations, such as major events during his CEOship at Merrill Lynch.<p>The main practical problem, imo, is that Google is unlikely to want to put in the resources that would be necessary to make case-by-case determinations, and would therefore probably just err on the side of deleting anything requested. But taken in isolation, this particular case really seems like one of the easier cases in which to reject the request, which they would probably win if litigated. Perhaps not quite as easy as if it were Silvio Berlusconi asking for articles about his political career to be delinked (that request would be <i>really</i> clearly rejectable), but O&#x27;Neal is still clearly a public figure, and the article in question was also about his public role as CEO (while the Mario Costeja Gonz√°lez case was about the personal bankruptcy filing of a pretty obscure individual).",1404331184

Let&#x27;s take a simple example of searching for Python&#x27;s os.unlink method:<p>1. Google &quot;Python os.unlink&quot;.<p>2. First link is <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html</a> which starts at the very top of the documentation for the os module.<p>3. CTRL + f/Command + f for &quot;os.unlink&quot;.<p>4. The first result on the page is right around <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.mkfifo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.mkfifo</a>.<p>5. Click on os.unlink words because it&#x27;s an actual link.<p>That last bit is very important. Every bit of documentation typically has a link from any module/object/method to its canonical documentation location. Contrast this with Django REST Framework, which does not do this and their docs are basically unusable because of this.<p>I agree that this could be shortened somehow to Google &quot;Python os.unlink&quot; and the first result being <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.unlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.unlink</a> but it&#x27;s such a minor flaw compared to everything else I&#x27;ve ever seen in terms of searching for docs that I am willing to live with it.<p>Contrast this with PHP&#x27;s docs. Here, it&#x27;s great: just go to <a href=""http://php.net/YOUR-FUNCTION"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/YOUR-FUNCTION</a> and you&#x27;ll get the docs. For example: <a href=""http://php.net/implode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/implode</a>. What I don&#x27;t like about these docs is that they often <i>lie to your face</i>. As in, they are just plain inaccurate and the way you find this out is by having your production code blow up. That right there is actual bad documentation.",1404331162

7979309,comment,7976493,7978704,1,0,virtualwhys,,,"> The ability to quickly switch between files<p>by context switching to the grey matter to inquire what the <i>name</i> of the file is and then tab complete your way to said file vs. where you visually &quot;know&quot; the file to be in standard panels (splits) with tabs (buffers) based editors.<p>> move a file between different windows<p>please don&#x27;t lie to the uninformed -- one can only rotate windows within the <i>same row or column</i>, not across columns and rows -- it&#x27;s rather limited.<p>> create and destroy splits, etc. is just so nice<p>I&#x27;d take drag and drop splits any day over Vim&#x27;s adhoc implementation. If you create a split it&#x27;s best to destroy it as it will <i>never</i> behave predictably; i.e. your split layout may completely collapse when closing a buffer.<p>and then cloned splits, man do I love to see the exact same file displayed across splits, nothing says maximize screen real estate usage like cloned content. Sure, can close the cloned split, but why waste one&#x27;s time on an event that isn&#x27;t even possible in GUI editors? (i.e. attempting to open an already open file brings you to its location, not pointlessly duplicates it).<p>> Every other editor seems clunky and inefficient<p>Feel the same way about Vim&#x27;s window management, try Sublime, heck even try Eclipse, you get multiple visible tabs (buffers) per panel (split), and as an added bonus, the labels are set <i>above</i> the code (where top-down, left-right humans expect it), not below. You can also quickly hotkey rotate through <i>all</i> opened files, bing, bing, bang vs. either reading through a buffer list that has <i>nothing</i> to do with its location in visual space, or praying that ctrl-O doesn&#x27;t start opening files from a previous session, or just saying ctrl-6 (toggling between 2 measly files) is the answer.<p>I think the deal with Vim is that you have to keep a lot in mind, literally, as in the entire set of file names you&#x27;re working with, vs. visual editors where code location is representation (i.e. its &quot;name&quot;).",1404331156

I would personally prefer something akin to D&#x27;s generic syntax (but with a different symbol, since the exclamation point already has meaning in Rust).<p>The reason for using :: instead of . for paths is because the Rust developers did not want to conflate path lookup and field lookup, which would obscure the runtime costs of indirection.

Once I had saved up enough for a down payment on a 2nd house, I bought it, moved there, and rented out my first place. If things keep going well I plan invest in a 3rd property by the end of this year.<p>Some factors that helped out:<p>1. I live in Texas so buying there is a healthy margin between mortgage payments and rent prices. Insurance prices eat into this margin but once you&#x27;re renting this becomes and above the line deduction on your taxes.<p>2. I bought my first house when I was 22 and lived there for 5 years.<p>3. Luck - my first house was flooded by Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Insurance payout worked out to a free remodeling and a kickstart for the down payment on the 2nd house.<p>4. I found tenants through assisted housing programs. Put in the work to find people who feel your property is a dream house, then they will want to be long-term tenants. The housing program pays via direct deposit on the first of the month so you never have to chase down money.<p>5.

I had a friend who was going to transfer to a college near my 2nd house so he&#x27;s living with me as a roommate.

Go and Rust are the finalists for that, with Python keeping the scripting side. Go just happened to finish first.<p>And, I think they both target the same use cases, they just adopted a different mind set on the way there. Most outsiders to Google don&#x27;t realize this, but Go expresses <i>volumes</i> about the way that Google works internally. And, as with Protocol Buffers, the really awesome stuff in the technology was held back; any Googler will tell you that Go inside the veil is a vastly different experience because of the language-agnostic systems that Google has built internally.<p>At the end of the day, I want a language to write the various tools and systems I need in my SRE life. I&#x27;ve had a hodgepodge until now, and Go is appealing because I can centralize on one (with one toolchain). Rust is becoming more palatable every day.",1404330738

7979253,comment,7976910,7977354,9,0,Cyther606,,,"I&#x27;ve been holding Bitcoin since it was $10. In my view, Bitcoin has always been thinly traded because most people new to Bitcoin learn that they should acquire as much of it as they can afford to, and then withdraw all of it from a centralized service. For example, they learn that decentralized, trustless money can only be decentralized and trustless when there&#x27;s no middlemen involved. Storing BTC on an exchange just invites back the middleman. Which is just not part of the narrative.<p>Because of this, Bitcoin exchanges have always lagged the market, and BTC-denominated trading volumes will almost certainly always remain small. The real demand comes from people who want to hoard all of it that they can. It&#x27;d be a lot like Pogs if it weren&#x27;t for the sorry state of government issued currencies.<p>Can this drive more and more people to currencies backed by nothing and governed by algorithms? Any news that affects this picture, moves the price, often times significantly, e.g. China. So in effect, the price of Bitcoin moves on whether the dream of breaking free from government issued currencies worldwide can actually happen.<p>In order to buy Bitcoin, you pretty much have to get over the fact that the only sustainable demand could come in the event that public trust towards mainstream institutions continues to erode to the point that people at large no longer trust the money. Or no longer trust the money for other reasons. The people who bought into BTC early on for pennies, viewed the situation like this, and many of them refuse to sell. I&#x27;ve seen people try to claim half of all Bitcoins have been deleted from hard drives in the early days or lost, which I find unbelievable. Then again, having been involved in the Bitcoin space for several years now, there&#x27;s very little left that I find unbelievable. There&#x27;s an enormous amount of disingenous players, and it&#x27;s completely cut throat actually. If you&#x27;re crazy enough to get on board with Bitcoin, chances are non-zero that you&#x27;re also crazy enough to do and say anything to take people&#x27;s BTCs. Because really, the narrative states that the price of BTC can only go up as more and more people lose faith in government backed currencies. The whole concept of a currency is based on mutually shared delusions, so it&#x27;s really not without merit.<p>To cut it short, this results in poor liquidity. I haven&#x27;t run the numbers myself, but I very much doubt the BTC trading volume, as measured in BTCs, as done anything but gone down now that the price reached $1200. That _really_ got the early adopters dreaming.<p>I&#x27;m honestly become extremely jaded and cynical over the last year in particular. If you think the idea of cryptocurrency can&#x27;t work, there&#x27;s not much you can do besides short it or ignore it. The latter is really quite hard, because anyone, even someone with less than 1 BTC to their name, inevitably finds it worth commenting on Bitcoin stories, and submitting Bitcoin related news of their own on social networking sites.<p>Bitcoin exchanges are moving to reduce fees to zero and add leveraged trading, because that&#x27;s all you can really do to offer substantial liquidity in a market where all of the &quot;real&quot; participants aren&#x27;t interested in trading, or spending the underlying. There&#x27;s just not enough trading activity. It goes back to the narrative. The sad part is most exchanges are shoddy or even outright fraudulent, see: MtGox (Mark Karpeles in all likelihood stole 850,000 BTC, and no i don&#x27;t find this surprising in the least bit).<p>All of you coming at this from the angle of HFT are playing with fire. That&#x27;s all I can say.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this is a good thing, quite the contrary. The price of Bitcoin is effectively determined by day traders, payment processors like Coinbase and BitPay with clientele that effectively accepts BTC and then dumps it on the market, along with the odd miner or newbie looking to acquire coins en masse. Not to be mean spirited, but what the heck. Everyone else doesn&#x27;t matter, because they don&#x27;t have enough money to affect the market.<p>Truly, the Bitcoin concept itself more closely resembles MLM / network marketing than any one traditional financial instrument.<p>Finally, anyone who has invested or lent BTC over even a short timeframe in the past two-three years will tell you that there&#x27;s no incentive to invest or lend or spend BTC. It is what it is. The only interesting game is acquiring as much BTC as you can afford and then playing with altcoins, which are mostly P&Ds.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a racket, maybe Bitcoin is only useful to spend on illicit items. Even so, the fact that more and more people are becoming interested in the idea of a currency governed by an algorithm just goes to show how little trust there is in mainstream institutions. This is why I&#x27;m very begrudgingly bullish. I don&#x27;t think anyone who day trades Bitcoin knows what they&#x27;re doing. I think it&#x27;s profitable to sell at the top of pure manic phases, but it&#x27;s not worth doing that when you consider taxes and reporting requirements. Buy and hold BTC in a wallet only you control. This has always been the best option, and it explains the overall shoddiness of the Bitcoin exchange scene.",1404330630

Are you aware of the fact that Computer Science, as a major, is not &quot;Learn programming&quot;? It is learning the theory and science behind Computers, computing and programming. What you suggest is more applicable for CNIT or Computers, Networking, and Information Technology; A major where one would learn more how to apply the theories and concepts of programming. But even then, you&#x27;re suggesting SCRIPTING languages for PROGRAMMING. The only thing a scripting language is good for in the education system is conveying concepts such as abstraction ( because that&#x27;s practically all they are ).

HN&#x27;s presentation layer is heavily intertwined with the application/server logic, which meant it was going to be a bit tricky to separate the two. The reason it was tricky is because the entire code base up to a few months ago was optimized to be worked on by one person, pg. For example, we didn&#x27;t even have docs on how to setup / run the arc code on local / development machines when we first got started.<p>Eventually we did get a version of HN working that&#x27;s separated the presentation logic, but we realized that MANY of you out there have built apps that rely on scraping HN&#x27;s outdated table markup. Because we decided that it would be bad to break all of your apps overnight, we&#x27;ve now started working on an API for HN to launch it in tandem with the new markup changes. We&#x27;d then give you all some time to update your projects.<p>Please try to keep in mind that new features for HN have to be done alongside a lot of other responsibilities. The software team that works on HN is also spending time moderating it and rewriting software that runs YC.

As you venture further from that domain, things begin to unravel.<p>Example: after giving a presentation at a recent Rust meetup, someone asked me if they could use Rust as a scripting language. My response was something along the lines of, &quot;sure, it&#x27;s as Turing-complete as any other language, but why would you <i>want</i> to?&quot; Mostly I would like people to acknowledge that different languages exist to serve different needs, and that there does not and will never exist One Language To Rule Them All.<p>Rust is a low-level systems language, and it&#x27;s optimized very, very well for that niche. I&#x27;m very happy if you want to use it all time, for everything! But please continue to <i>evaluate</i> it as a systems programming language.

Solving a problem with someone looking over your shoulder and forcing you to talk to explain what you are thinking is a skill that I&#x27;ve never seen used in the real world. I&#x27;m sure new grads spend a lot of time in classes training for this. Many great people don&#x27;t function like this and still they may come up with brilliant ideas after a day or a week.

I know many brilliant engineers who have been rejected and are doing just fine, building amazing products, and leading teams.<p>If corporations really wanted a cookie cutter method to evaluate CS knowledge, then they should require a scientifically validated standardized test conducted by a third party. It would be cheaper than using engineers&#x27; time.

Clearly, you don&#x27;t want to consider any opinion other than your own:<p>I&#x27;m happy to consider your opinion, I just don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>> Prove it. Provide sources. This is contradictory to the past 100 years of civilization.<p>This is a purely logical statement that does not require sources to prove. Imagine a society with 9 people, and 90 units of production, each person getting 10 units. Then imagine an improvement where total production goes up to 120 units, but the extra units are distributed so that each of the top three people get 20 units. Thus, not all changes that increase overall production necessarily improve the lot for the median person.<p>> Have you ever heard of &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot;? What if the majority wanted slavery? We don&#x27;t live in a democracy in the US--it&#x27;s a simple way to communicate public participation in society, which is needed.<p>You&#x27;ve got it backwards. We don&#x27;t just have public participation in society, we have rule by the will of the majority, through elected leaders. The phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;majority rule.&quot; Rather, it refers to the exceptional case in which the majority uses its authority to abuse minorities. In the U.S. protections exist to prevent such abuse, but those are exceptions to the general rule that the majority is in charge.<p>In a system of limited government, the majority can express it&#x27;s will through the government only in certain limited ways. But in the U.S., the &quot;government&quot; (state and local together) have nearly unlimited scope. In the U.S., the majority can express its will in nearly any way it wants, limited only by certain individual rights.<p>> Finally, I&#x27;m confused with your last assertion that policy that reduces overall production but leaves the median person better off could be rational. How is that rational?<p>Go back to the second scenario above. 9 people, 120 total units of production, with everyone having 10 except the top 3 people who have 20. In the next year, the people vote to change the rules so that total production is 111 units. However, that production is distributed so everyone has 11 units, while the top three people have 15 each. Thus, you have a scenario in which overall production is lower, but six people are better off and three people are worse off than the year before. In a democratic society, this is a totally rational policy.",1404329633

7979017,comment,7976405,7977922,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to diminish what you are saying because it‚Äôs valid too.  I just disagree.  The problem with imperative code vs functional code is that it&#x27;s difficult to analyze all of the states without just running it (I realize there&#x27;s a lot more nuance than that).  I personally don&#x27;t think that any of the major players like C++, java or even Go can be saved because there are just too many side effects.  But, in fairness no language can be guaranteed to work 100% properly once it has access to external resources (unless the inputs and outputs can be guaranteed to be within a known set).  The other big players like Haskell/Closure/Scala can‚Äôt be saved either, because they can do anything imperative code can do (you could basically write a C compiler in a functional language and make it unpredictable under some condition).  Worse than that, functional languages are basically unreadable without strong backgrounds in the theory.  As has been said many times, there is no silver bullet.<p>But, that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt try.  I think for starters, a reasonably safe language that is binary compatible with C could begin replacing some of the aging code under the right circumstances.  I think we are long overdue for a tool that can exercise a binary over some number of inputs and outputs and come up with the underlying code.  Unfortunately it would also copy errors, which is kind of bizarre to think about.  We sort of have decompilers now but they generally result in an unreadable mess because they have no notion of the kinds of considerations humans make when they write code.  I would prefer a decompiler that takes a typical toolset (linked lists, binary trees, etc) and arranges those metaphors in a way that generates the same code even if it‚Äôs a little less efficient.  That kind of efforts obviously needs a moonshot from universities/government/philanthropists and I don‚Äôt see it happening any time soon.  It‚Äôs on par with strong AI.  And more importantly, it‚Äôs probably not profitable.  But if we had it, we could take the behavior driven design that business people or Star Trek characters reason in and generate a program that performs that behavior.  Genetic programming comes close here but current hardware isn‚Äôt suited to it because we aren‚Äôt used to thinking in terms of search spaces 10 or 20 orders of magnitude larger than what we can hold in our heads.<p>I remember the first time I saw UNIX, my very first thought was ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt possibly be how computers work‚Äù.  It only seems to work now because we‚Äôve been immersed in it so long, but its fatal flaw is illiteracy.  99% of the population isn‚Äôt educated enough to use it effectively.  I remember thinking the same thing when I saw HTML.  The main reason the web took off is that it could handle plain text, not because of some magic with parsing tags.  All people wanted to do was post MS Word files, and it failed at that (among numerous other things).  So I‚Äôm not arguing against something like the stream as the underlying principle that makes UNIX so powerful, I‚Äôm arguing against everything else added on top of it that was written in a non-human way and makes it illegible and brittle.<p>Hardware has gone almost nowhere in 30 years.  I‚Äôm still using the basically single threaded CPU that I was using the first time I saw a Mac in 1984.  It‚Äôs faster and cheaper but fundamentally the same.  Video cards have kind of gone somewhere, but with their proprietary/closed and narrowly scoped use case, they have made 3D programming needlessly complex compared to a true programmable multicore CPU.  Until my computer can run a concurrent version of Go on a realistic number of processors (say 256+, or unlimited via the web) I don‚Äôt see any revolutionary advances in AI, physics, medicine, etc coming any time soon.<p>Unfortunately I really can‚Äôt go into enough detail with this stuff on a forum.  I guess that‚Äôs the gist of the wetware issue.  How do I take my experience and distill it down into something others can use to avoid the same mistakes?  More importantly, how do I convey the greater expectations that would be possible if we had better tools?  Or even incorporate other people‚Äôs notions myself when I‚Äôm knee-deep in code?  I‚Äôm thinking in terms of things like freeing people from labor and admittedly technology has gone a long way towards that end, but for some reason it stuttered maybe in the mid 90s and I can‚Äôt quite figure out how that happened or how to get past it.  It‚Äôs a bit like living within the Matrix and knowing that something is terribly wrong without being able to fathom what would be beyond it.  Maybe it‚Äôs something geopolitical and people have decided that this level of progress is enough and just don‚Äôt care about going further.  I‚Äôm certain if there was a demand, manufacturers would sell the tech that would run circles around what we‚Äôre having to use now.  But there is more money in video games and solving first world problems, so here we are.",1404328604

Eight times slower than C! I know I was hitting a edge case for a very specific kind of computation but still.

For example there&#x27;s no way Java BigInteger can compete with GMP and there&#x27;s no way GMP is getting ported to Java anytime soon (GMP is open source: just go and look at some of the optimization going on and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about).

But now I just don&#x27;t care. The vast majority of economists are horrible programmers, however most know how to script in at least 1 language, and a small number of them are actually really good at scripting. An extremely small number of economists know they&#x27;re way around at least 1 entire general purpose programming language.<p>It seems that every time this gets brought up online a sea of infamous Fortran-programming-economists always tell you how fast Fortran is compared to everything else, signing it with &quot;Fortran or GTFO&quot;. I&#x27;ve met hundreds/thousands of economists and econ grad students at schools ranked from 1 to 200, and I don&#x27;t recall a single one that actually used Fortran (I&#x27;m sure there is a non-zero quantity -- I probably just haven&#x27;t cared to talk with them b/c they are most likely macro theorists).<p>The fact of the matter is that in economics graduate school, your professors could care less what language you use. It isn&#x27;t an algorithm competition, it&#x27;s a story telling competition. But the type of story telling economists do is no less noble than writing elegant algos. Writing a story based on economic mechanisms and behaviors and supporting it with quality data, sound statistics, and logical/exact theories is no simple task.",1404328273

Is it just that it can run without a JRE?",1404327793

I think this is absolutely the right direction to be going if coinbase (and bitcoin) want to become mainstream. An exchange is mainly for traders and most people like myself don&#x27;t want to look at candlestick charts to know when to purchase or make a bid without any certainty of obtaining coins or worse compete with bots. On the other hand many people I know have kept away from bitcoin because of how seemingly complicated and confusing it is to supposedly keep secure -don&#x27;t keep coins on exchange, use paper wallet, encrypt backups of private keys. This is definitely a step in the right direction towards attracting a more mainstream audience. As for a &#x27;Pay with Bitcoin&#x27; button, are you kidding, how do you think overstock, newegg etc accept bitcoin payments - this is one of the first things they did.",1404327742

My town is big enough that I don&#x27;t feel alone at all here.<p>I live in Sitka. We have ~9000 people here, but you can only get here by boat or plane. It&#x27;s really nice to be off the road system. If you need to get out, you can take a plane and be in Juneau in an hour or two, in Anchorage in a few hours, and you can get to Seattle in about 4 hours.<p>That said, you can climb to the top of a mountain, drop down the other side a little bit, and see no sign of humans for hundreds of miles. That&#x27;s a pretty nice balance. :)",1404327705

I am a C++ programmer so I&#x27;m happy that C++ came out on top, but the comparison is obviously flawed (as these sorts of comparisons always are). The problem is that the implementers don&#x27;t have the same level of skill in each language and who knows how much time they spent analyzing and refining each version. See Russ Cox&#x27;s response [2] to a Google paper [3] of a similar nature comparing C++, Go, Java, Scala for an example of a similar boondoggle.<p>The R code, for instance, is obviously unidiomatic.

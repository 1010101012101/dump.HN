1171198,comment,1170803,1171148,0,0,zaidf,,,"I am not qualified to write much and what I can write would delve more details about our super nascent business than I'd want to. That's probably lesson number one: when you get sales right, you don't talk a whole lot about it with people:) I am very open in general, but when it comes to sales, I think it is a lot of very domain specific knowledge(getting over customer objections) that make or break your sales.<p>On hiring, we are only now beginning to hire direct sales people. First, I find people from my industry. Then, this is how I quickly filter them: what was your quota, did you meet them? I let the numbers talk. I have no idea how this will work. We'll know more over next few months. My cofounder-on-trial comes from a sales background where he did 60K in sales over a year as an intern.<p>One major suggestion I would give you is to take a sales class at the best uni around you. I took it around the time I was negotiating my first reseller contract. My professor really helped me in negotiating the deal all the way to close. But most importantly, I learned really different ways sales can be structured that we tech folks would never imagine.<p>Good luck!",1267854194

1171180,comment,1171117,1171143,0,0,najirama,,,"[Edit: spelling mistakes]<p>Based on your response, you do not even understand the terms I've been using.<p>'Set of classes,' means <i>everything</i> per this discussion - as the discussion has been premised on the statement you made (that skin color is an indicator of class).<p>So when you say things like...:<p><i>""If you're trying to predict someone's behavior, distinguishing someone who makes $59,999 from someone who makes $60,000 makes no sense.""</i><p>..You suggest that you either do not understand my argument, or, you do not understand what has been meant by the word ""class"" in this discussion.<p>So I'll say it again; Classes are defined by an <i>interval</i> on the set of <i>natural numbers</i>. This isn't a discussion about guessing incomes with any greater precision than those provided to us by said classes.<p>The data provided to us by the census bureau document is the average. Note that the ""households"" in the census include <i>BOTH</i> family and non-family households.<p>So, when you say things like...:<p><i>""The poverty threshold for a family of four is $22,025. Black households have a ""surplus"" income of $12,193. White households have a surplus income of $33,505.""</i><p>...You hint that you didn't quite understand that the average provided was calculated including single-households as well as non-single households with kids. So your whole reply is a bit of a straw-man...<p>...But it isn't even really a good one. We are talking about race as a predictor so let us control for income and work backwards. Imagine two families, one black, the other white, both living with an income of $34,218, both with four children. Is it then your contention that the Black family is still more likely to produce a thief?<p>If so, I do consider your mind boggled.",1267852896

1171177,comment,1171083,1171083,0,0,wheels,,,"I whole-heartedly disagree.  Starting things is my litmus-test for deciding if I'm going to take them further.<p>Examples:<p>• My usual way to pick a next book to read is to start reading 5.  Whichever one pulls me in the most wins.<p>• When sorting though startup ideas <i>many</i> of them were for things I'd prototyped / researched in the past, including the one that became Directed Edge.<p>Unfinished projects leave <i>positive</i> pressure for me to go back and do things at some point in my life.  Starting in on something is the best way to learn its dimensions.  There's this <i>pleasant</i> queue of things that I'd like to finish up in life at some point before kicking the bucket, and I suspect it will only continue to get longer.<p>I'm not saying, ""don't be a finisher"" – but the important thing seems to finishing <i>many</i> projects, not <i>all</i> of them.",1267852746

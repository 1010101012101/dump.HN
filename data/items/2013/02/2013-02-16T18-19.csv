About a year ago I wrote some code to do some basic comparative analysis at the genome level alongside some more gene focused phylogeny efforts. Since the whole thing was quite simple it wasn't a problem to write the overall structure, but getting the bioinformatics Python libraries working was a pain. Even if the code tiself was Python the API was littered with various Perl and Bash idioms and there was a major bug in at least one of the tree building methods (had to patch it myself). Calls to subprocesses within the libraries (a heavy part of most bioinformatics work, where there are thousands of stand alone command line programs) would often fail without warning. The state of the art in this area is definitely behind Ruby and far behind Perl.<p>However, Python is still my main language and I am very happy with that. The numpy/scipy stack and everything building around that is incomparable to anything in Perl of Ruby. Also for the last month or so I have been doing work in the IPython notebook.

5232422,comment,5230823,5230823,5,0,east2west,,,"A few things in this pierce struck a cord with me. I am a computer science Ph.D. doing a postdoc in statistics department, working on biostatistics, and as I am recently looking for a job and did a few interviews, some observations may be helpful to job candidates.<p>First, people are pigeonholed into certain roles. Statisticians analyze data and design experiments. They are expected to know classical statistical fields, theorems, and their standard usage and caveats. Programmers should be able to answer standard programming questions, such as dynamic programming, balanced tree, etc., and of course write programs. In large company where specialization is the mantra, expertise in both fields is not an assert in interviews.<p>Second, multidisciplinary experience can be a liability. Since my experience in statistics is nonstandard, more of signal processing than classical statistical inference, I am not as conversant in classical statistical theory as a statistical Ph.D. does, especially because genomic research often prefers most basic methods, as in industry. Interviewers rightly ask about things they know, and are not impressed if one cannot answer questions they learned in graduate class. It is similar with computer engineering interviewers. They will ask me to implement an interval tree or dynamic programming algorithm in 30 minutes. Most of my heavy programming is in numerical analysis and optimization, where dynamic programming is very different from what a programmer thinks it is.<p>Third, depth is not required in industry, and certainly not in interview. Interviews now-days feel  very much like college entrance exam in China or one of those East Asian countries, where people are expected to regurgitate set answers and the most important trick is to meet expectation. It is not important to master materials but to have right answers. And the right answer depends on the person asking question. One may considers SVM to be mainly a kernel trick that molds nonlinear relation into linear function, while another considers SVM as finite approximation of dynamic optimization with a breakthrough in quadratic programming that efficiently solves the two-points boundary problem coming out of dynamic optimization. This gets back to pigeonholing roles. A professional statistician will prefer one while a control/dynamic system expert will like the other. The killer is that some interviewers ask questions with their preferred answer in mind, and the questions can baffling to people with different background.<p>Forth, different companies demand different capabilities for supposedly same roles. Data scientists can be as mundane as denormalization or as sophisticated as inventing a way of causal inference. It is not always easy to tell from ads. It is even less so when the company wants jack of all trades and experts in all possible tasks. Ask very pointed questions.<p>Fifth, there is no advantage in being both good programmers and good statisticians, at least in interviews. I have already noted several disadvantages. People much prefer build inter-disciplinary teams each member of which is tasked with one special area and let them talk. It works well. I cannot think of anything that requires expertise in both programming and statistics in one head. It may be a little slower, but not noticeable.<p>I am having doubts about a position in a large company because of too much specialization. I like to derive an algorithm and implement it efficiently. Even if I could get a position, and I could if I cram for interviews, I would be at a disadvantage when others can concentrate on one area. Sadly, academia is becoming very much like industry, except they count papers or grants instead of make money. I am still looking for my niche.<p>I guess the gist of my rant is that today's job market demands specialization and people better conform.",1361039464

Oops! Looks like both the client and the server have to be trusted, otherwise we've got at least one probably-exploitable vulnerability. And there's no mechanism for authentication, so it's really only safe to use on locally-secured network.

If you/we believe there are societal/economic benefits to the open web, they must be argued persuasively and clearly.<p>Too many digital commentators and bloggers do not engage with these issues in any productive way.<p>Attack articles do not reform political procedures, substantive policy suggestions do.<p>The BBC quite obviously, and validly, worries that open use of its content will put it at a competitive disadvantage. They can foresee International producers withdrawing content from its platforms if its distribution channels are not duly protected. That does not seem like an unfair concern.<p>There might be space to argue that the BBC is being short-sighted. That is to say, that while we understand its concerns on this issue, the introduction of DRM will negatively affects its longer term success. That is to say, the success of the BBC has been prefaced on the wide distribution of its original content around the world. In fact, it wouldn't be too strong to say the BBC's reputation rests on the free, worldwide distribution of its news programming -- today this has been inherited by its news website.<p>We might press the concern that locking all of its content behind DRM technology will harm the wide distribution of its content, hurting awareness of its international brand.<p>We ask the BBC to consider the following example: fears of recording radio programming have existed since the early 20th Century. If the BBC, cracked down on its distribution in response to those issues in the 50s-, we believe the BBC wouldn't be the worldwide powerhouse it is now.<p>Locking up its content is not in the long term interests of the BBC brand, esp. as the developing world -- China, Brazil, Russia -- start looking online for reliable programming.<p>Therefore, we call on the BBC to initiate a review into the implications of its policy decision, and its effect on international brand awareness.<p>This isn't my argument, but at least it understands, appreciates, and responds to their economic concerns.",1361037645

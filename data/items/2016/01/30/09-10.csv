11001297,comment,10998486,10998486,0,0,djokkataja,,,"YC Research should fund research on synthetic consciousness based on human models of consciousness. Consciousness research is still un-mainstream enough that there&#x27;s a common perception that no one has any idea how consciousness works or even what it is, even though we actually know quite a bit:<p>In particular, the <i>dynamic thalamic core theory of conscious experience</i> (Google it, the author-posted paper requests you don&#x27;t link directly to it) offers a tremendous amount of explanatory power. From the perspective of engineering a synthetic system, you can build on the model to accommodate any aspect of conscious experience. For example, if you have an &quot;input module&quot; that feeds into a visual recognition network that feeds into a conceptual association network, the conceptual association network can activate neurons in the input module that correspond to the neurons that would be activated when perceiving the visual details corresponding to certain concepts. So the input module becomes a place where multiple simulated percepts of concepts can be activated simultaneously, and then &quot;for free&quot; by the nature of the architecture, you get visual recognition processing of the simulated perceptions combined with &quot;raw&quot; perceptions (or combined with other simulated perceptions). As a bonus, you get language comprehension: after perceiving the visual details of a written word, the system would recognize the associated concept (presuming it had previously learned it) and trigger a simulated perception of the concept. Run this process recursively over a sentence, and the system has a simulated experience which would correspond to the semantic meaning conveyed by the sentence.<p>The human brain has an architecture that appears quite similar: a specifically layered, recursive connectivity between the thalamus (the &quot;input center&quot; of the brain) and the cerebral cortex (which handles low level recognition and conceptual associations, among other things). Regardless of whether or not the human brain works <i>exactly</i> in the vague way I described: 1. <i>You could engineer a system to perform the tasks outlined above</i>, and the architecture would lend itself to whatever facets of human-like cognition you might be interested in (try it, it&#x27;s easy). You wouldn&#x27;t be able to gloss over the details like it&#x27;s an HN post, but there aren&#x27;t fundamental roadblocks. 2. Neuroscience research regarding the function of the thalamus and the function of the thalamocortical system is very favorable towards this model (particularly if you factor in the basal ganglia), but more generally--the human brain is nowhere near a &quot;black box&quot;. We can&#x27;t read the brain like a hard drive, but it&#x27;s plainly not a ball of evenly distributed computational goo where any computation could happen anywhere, anytime. For each individual human, specific patterns of activation <i>in the cerebral cortex</i> correspond to specific perceptions and patterns of activation <i>in the thalamus</i>, which implies... 3. The synthetic consciousness I proposed could be connected to a brain-computer interface (attached to your head) (your head, not mine!) (no I want it give it back) so it can learn to recognize your thoughts (this learning process could be enhanced in various ways; for example eye-tracking combined with a forward-facing camera could help the synthetic consciousness know what you&#x27;re paying attention to, which adds context for learning to recognize what your thoughts may be about), <i>and</i> because the synthetic consciousness has simulated perceptions in the same region as raw perceptions, you can view its thoughts in real-time as well. It&#x27;s a white-box architecture.<p>This kills two massively valuable birds with one stone: you get strong AI (more accurately, you get strong synthetic intelligence; &quot;artificial&quot; starts sounding rude after a point), and you solve the &quot;control problem&quot; because you can use your enhanced knowledge of consciousness to develop systems that have human consciousness merged with synthetic consciousness. &quot;What about the human who&#x27;s enhanced by the merger with the synthetic intelligence though!?!&quot; The integration with the synthetic intelligence makes the human&#x27;s brain a white box as well. If you wanted, you could integrate multiple such systems together (to whatever degree is comfortable for the systems). So ultimately the control problem becomes a question of how much we trust ourselves and each other after we can read each other&#x27;s minds. Yes, it would probably be terrifying initially, but I think we&#x27;d get used to it quickly, and there are numerous meditative traditions which might be helpful to anyone who struggled to control thoughts that others found particularly repellent.<p>After that it&#x27;s a relatively straightforward recursive self-improvement deal. Eventually you improve the system enough that the biological component is redundant (yay). From there you make sure that whatever you&#x27;re using for physical presence is generally robust. And if you&#x27;re not incredibly rude, you might be kind enough to use your enhanced intelligence(s) to figure out how to gracefully share the technology with whatever other humans may want it (because presumably the recursive self-improvement process may happen in a relatively short period of time, and it&#x27;s unlikely that literally everyone will engage in it at once). You&#x27;ll have to figure out societal structures that make sense for whatever you all consider yourselves to be at that point. Then dive into advanced physics to figure out how to do whatever you want to do in neat ways, and if you decide to make von Neumann probes, don&#x27;t send them off until the physics research has tapered off, because you&#x27;ll probably just be beaten by the newer, faster probes if you&#x27;re impatient and send a bunch off right at the start.<p>The timeframe mainly depends on how quickly you can iterate on the self-improvement process. Presumably some of that process is going to involve iterating on hardware (and probably iterating on the process of creating better hardware), but the hardware already exists to make a start. Early speed improvements would come from 1. not having to physically type or use a mouse/touchscreen to interact with a computer (programming at the speed of thought?) and 2. some degree of &quot;telepathy&quot; to help coordinate research. Later speed improvements could come from things like &quot;forking&quot; the synthetic portion to run in parallel for some period of time to learn or do things (can merge &quot;copies&quot; back in afterwards rather than ending them abruptly so that nobody has a bad time). You probably wouldn&#x27;t want to run the synthetic portion at a rate significantly above your general biological rate of cognition, so that would put some vague upper bound on raw speed improvements until the biological portion is completely redundant.<p>At any rate, the initial steps are quite straightforward and would make addressing every other issue in this thread go faster. It would definitely be faster to go this route than to try cure aging, for example. Biological aging won&#x27;t even be relevant at the end of this process, aging by definition involves a superset of the complexity of the human brain alone, and progress on the earlier steps towards curing aging do not increase the speed of progress on later steps towards curing aging.",1454147434

Or approximately 1,200 homes. New Jersey has a population density of 1218.1 people per square mile. A $2.7 million geothermal power plant would provide sufficient energy for the farm&#x27;s annual lighting, to give an idea of costs. That power would not be enough to provide the energy for automation or recharging delivery vehicles.<p>Plants don&#x27;t absorb much of the green spectrum. If they could be biohacked to use more of the spectrum, the energy requirements could be cut substantially. (Another option is to dramatically improve either laser light or plasma light in the optimal spectrum for a particular crop.)<p>Additionally, a lot more research needs to be made in finding out how to grow food aeroponically. Currently, I think it&#x27;s limited to tomatoes, greens, and possibly some tubers.<p>To introduce minerals into the aeroponic water supply (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Sulfur, Magnesium, Boron, Chlorine, Manganese, Iron, Zinc, Copper, and Molybdenum) requires fish (salmon, catfish, tuna), seawater, crustaceans (crab, lobster), shellfish, fungi, seaweed, and captured elements from an open-loop geothermal plant. Nickel might have to be mined.

There is currently a huge decoupling of supply and demand in academia, especially in life sciences which is my home domain. Incredibly talented individuals are forced to invest 6-14 years building the credentials necessary to apply for grant funding / self-sufficiency, all the while (at best) earning what a new grad would make if they became a tech in pharma straight out of college. Most people cycle out before hitting their prime, at the expense of our economy.<p>This decoupling between supply and demand has also motivated other negative trends, such as changes in employment incentives for labs (large push for postdocs / foreign students at the expense of grad students); increasing importance of publishing in high impact, for profit journals (more paywalling of knowledge); sabotage of the peer review process; and a deliberate siloing of what should be public knowledge to prevent &quot;competition&quot; (among other things).<p>Ultimately I see most basic science being performed in an institute model existing in parallel to academia. In such a model, investigators should own their own ip, would have their salaries uncapped, and would be able to employ qualified people at a fair market wage. In my eyes, the biggest barrier to enacting such a model is startup capital. Most universities give new faculty members a &quot;startup package&quot;; essentially an angel investment to allow them to buy equipment / reagents and pay salaries before they need to support themselves off of grant funding. A new institute would not have the capital required to support this (unless it received extensive funding from foundations / industry / NIH etc).<p>I envision crowd funded startup packages with caveats. One potential model could mimic angel investment / old school patronage: an investigator receives $X in exchange for a percentage ownership of whatever IP they create within Y years, distributed among the investors. Another model could mimic kickstarter: people crowd fund an investigator with small investments and are rewarded by being part of the process. They are given regular updates, walked through experiments / data, invited to the lab if they are local to see work being done etc. I&#x27;m sure other funding mechanisms exist that I have not considered.

But as it stands it is very hard to get perspective on the problem, or know which ways are good or bad.  A mathematician who is not an expert in the field may experiment with various ways of bounding Zeta away from zero, but a domain expert would right away point out positive vertical density results for all a-sets, and bounds on moments of 1/zeta(s).  Worse: if you have an idea for a new approach, there&#x27;s no good way to share it because it will likely be too small for the quantum of academia: the academic paper.  Building a collaborative atlas for the Riemann Hypothesis would help solve both of these problems, and could provide a more structured way of working on hard problem than even the polymath projects.  It&#x27;ll be a challenging use-case but at least with 150 years&#x27; of work there will be no cold start problem.  And I&#x27;ve seen many analytic number theorists who are incredibly smart, hard-working, insightful, great with programming, happy to get their hands dirty, eager to teach others, but neglected by the system and lacking an outlet for their skills.  PS: There&#x27;s still no clear reason to believe RH to be true rather than false.",1454146119

And of course that lifespan should be available to everyone. If the solution itself doesn&#x27;t already imply a post-scarcity world, then it&#x27;ll help that once you have a cure for aging, it&#x27;s more economical to supply that to everyone than to treat the myriad complications that arise from aging.

Enjoy the read, look how pompous, how grandiloquent this is! Look at all this tragedy! And I mean not only the writer herself — the quote of the girlfriend, which serves as an epigraph is already too much.<p>And it&#x27;s not just that I&#x27;m not a big fan of newyorker&#x27;s style (even though I&#x27;m not), the whole read is composed in a very specific way. It isn&#x27;t biographical, not documentary, it&#x27;s more of an essay, purpose of which is not to tell Aaron&#x27;s story as such, but <i>the writer&#x27;s</i> story, with it&#x27;s own premise and morale.<p>So what is this story all about? The suicide. And the whole Aaron&#x27;s life is shown as a prelude to it. The suicide is the point, and the whole life is &quot;an explanation&quot; for it: story, which, we are given to understand, was likely to end with a suicide sooner or later. As the writer eloquently calls it — &quot;the darker side&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easy to convey that, because it&#x27;s a social norm to view a suicide as a tragedy, regardless of circumstances. But let us be cynical just for a minute and look at what happened: some guy was fighting for his ideals; the party he was fighting against was something way bigger than him, a mere mortal; he lost; he died. Suicide never was a big deal, apparently not for Aaron, anyway. What was a big deal for him: his war for the social justice. And, let&#x27;s face it, there&#x27;re plenty of other guys who end their lives with suicide, newyorker doesn&#x27;t write about them. So, as a matter of fact, the suicide isn&#x27;t a big deal for a newyorker as well, even though MacFarquhar won&#x27;t admit it, maybe even to herself.<p>Yet it&#x27;s made to look as if it is precisely what is the big deal and it&#x27;s socially acceptable to display it that way. What the story really was about — the fight, and those on the other side of it — that we won&#x27;t be thinking of, we won&#x27;t discuss it, we won&#x27;t remember it. Instead, it will be all about &quot;a darker side&quot; and a tragedy.<p>Regardless of whether what Aaron did or was doing was right or wrong, regardless of if he was a hero or just a fool — I think it&#x27;s a pity.

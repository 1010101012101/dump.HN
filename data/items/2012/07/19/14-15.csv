4266233,comment,4259602,4265890,2,0,kbolino,,,"I've done some more reading on this issue, and I don't think what you are saying is correct.<p>First, class loading is more granular than JAR files.  From what I can tell, the JARs are just repositories (if you will) for the actual class data.  Once a class has been loaded from a JAR, it is distinct from it, and there is no need to keep the whole JAR in memory.<p>Second, there are many class loaders at play, not just one.  At the least, there will be one class loader for Tomcat and one class loader for <i>each web app.</i>  This is necessary to keep web apps from breaking each other (and Tomcat!) by loading incompatible versions of classes.<p>Third, once a class is no longer used (i.e. there exist no objects that are instances of it) it can be garbage collected, and will be if more PermGen space is needed.<p>Fourth, once a web app is unloaded, its class loader is no longer needed, and it too can be garbage collected (along with any memory it was using to store the aforementioned JAR files, although presumably that memory would be outside of PermGen).<p>Taking all of this into account, one might (like me) naively presume that once you unload a web app, all of its objects will no longer be referenced, and this will propagate up the tree of references (servlet -> object -> ... -> object -> class) until nothing from that app remains.<p>HOWEVER, this assumes that references exist in a tree.  A singleton class would cause problems: it stores a reference to an object of its own type.  This creates a circular reference pattern (class X -> object -> class X) and keeps both class and object in memory.<p>A possible solution might be to associate each class with the web app that loaded it, then when you unload a web app, you can walk through all of the classes it loaded and null out all of their static fields.  This will allow the referenced objects to be garbage collected, and in turn, the classes of those objects.<p>But this is probably much easier said than done (it may even be impossible due to limitations on the JVM), and there are probably other issues I'm not even aware of and thus not considering.  Never mind JNI, which just adds even more fun to the mix.<p>So ultimately I must agree with the recommendation to restart Tomcat when you're deploying web apps.  From a developer perspective, I would also recommend eliminating static data in your libraries and web apps as much as possible.",1342709552
4266232,comment,4265364,4265677,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I really don't understand this assumption that all performance enhancing substances will destroy your body. Not all doping is steriods. Some of it is for enhanced healing and recovery, something that should be researched. And in many cases abuse is the problem not use - as they say, the dose makes the poison. As we increase our ability to track and monitor drug response, internal vital statistics, and homeostasis; the notion of side-effects will become less nebulous. The problem is we are flying blind at the moment.<p>Do you know what site specific genetic therapies, drugs for cancer, HIV, malaria and performance enhancing substances have in common? In order to not do collateral damage they all require precise delivery to targets and an understanding of how a person's genome, protein networks and metabolism interact. Any understanding that comes from a better model of these interactions will have positive knock off effects on all the other areas. Just like we have the video game industry to thank in part for modern performance computing - monetarily motivated ""doping"" could also impact conditions like osteoporosis, obesity, Parkinsons and ALS.<p>Then there is an assumption that anything good must come with a cost. While it is true that nothing is free, it is not always the case that the negatives will outweigh or balance the positive. For example, in the short term it looks like anything beyond our current silicon based mouse, touch, keyboard paradigm is just pie in the sky. But if you were to go back to when computers were built from relays and vacuum tubes, their prediction of the future trajectory of  computing would be drastically different from today's because transistors, ICs and VLSI did not exist yet.<p>Biology is very complex but not all the complexity is inherent. Some of it is due to approcah. And this is changing as quantitative approaches become more prevalent and biology continues to increase the ability of its practictioners to fix radios.<p><a href=""http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v69/pdf/bcm_1403.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v69/pdf/bcm_14...</a>",1342709546

4266186,comment,4265086,4265419,5,0,barik,,,"I'm starting to suspect that the people who keep recommending TrueCrypt for day-to-day usage on Dropbox fall into the camp of ""Do as I say, not as I do."" Because if they are actually using TC the way they suggest, they might as well use FTP.<p>First, I created a small 64 MB TrueCrypt partition. I then mounted the partition in TC. I noticed immediately that the tc file has an exclusive lock, so any changes in your TC partition will never be synced until the partition is unmounted! If your use case is to mount your partition immediately upon login, work for the day, and then shutdown, Dropbox will never have an opportunity to sync your partition.<p>My next test was to mount the TC partition simultaneously (Desktop and Laptop). Then I run into conflicts, as another posted mentioned. Because of the exclusive file lock, if you mount simultaneously on two machines, you will start getting duplicate -conflict files when unmounting either of the partitions, since the other is still locked. It's not immediately clear from examination which TC partition is actually the most recent one. And may Gods have mercy on you if at any time you edit both partitions before they sync.<p>Even if you're willing to live with these annoyances, there is now the trade-off of which partition size to create. Too large of a partition and syncing can take a long time, even if you make minimal file changes (because of chaining, there is not a 1 bit -> 1 bit change in TC partitions). Too small of a partition, and you'll have to keep resizing it or creating new ones. What a hassle.<p>The only use case which seems to work well for me, is for minimally modified files, like for annual tax returns. Here, a TrueCrypt container makes sense and works quite well because the partition is basically read-only and unlikely to be simultaneously or even regularly mounted.<p>So for those people who keep suggesting TrueCrypt, I'm curious, do you actually use it, and if so, how? The suggestions for file-level encryption (encfs) appear to be much more sane.",1342708884

In many RAID configurations, you're going to zero-write the entire disk when formatting it, so performance is going to suck from the get-go. For this reason, even if you have a tiny database and don't expect to write 1TB worth of data, your performance might still suck. Personally, I haven't tried linux software md TRIM in production, the patch is pretty recent, so you're on your own here (if possible, scaling out horizontally may be a solution to consider for redundancy, I have no idea what Amazon using for SSDs, but recent Sandforce generations fail all the time, so plan for that).<p>If you don't know to look for this issue, you're going to be scratching your head when your RAID10 SSD configuration write throughput is worse than a single 7200rpm drive. On the other hand, IOPS on SSDs are <i>AMAZING</i> for databases/datastores. Amazon may have solved this for you already behind their visualization instance, and they might be running their own software striping behind whatever raid you're doing, so be sure to test it out fully first.",1342707944

The entire thing can be clocked up an down like on a modern x86 chip.  But it's also possible to put cores to sleep individually, which reduces power consumption even further.<p>I'm not sure how good an example Raspberry Pi is, simply because it includes features like a GPU.  A computer probably really only needs one of most of that kind of stuff, so it would make more sense to look at the power requirements for a bare ARM chip than for a complete computer built around it.<p>-- change of subject --<p>What I've been running into (including hard and repeatedly over the last few days) is that parallelizing workstation-end tasks without killing performance in the process is <i>hard</i>.  Shared-memory parallelism in particular is painful, because with too many cooks in the kitchen they'll end up spend more time trying to not pour boiling water on each other than making food.  For example, every time you hit a memory barrier all the cores that are working against that memory need to stop and consult the L3 cache or, worse yet, main memory.  That introduces an enormous stall (Of course if you're in a situation where non-trivial parallelizing is worth the effort, any stall feels enormous.), so it needs to be avoided as much as possible. . . which tends to not be an easy thing to do if you're doing shared-memory parallelism.  Because if it were trivial, then you'd probably have been able to get away with shared-nothing.<p>Now the ""lots of tiny cores"" approach gets more interesting when you can get away with a more shared-nothing approach like what the article suggests.  But it comes at a big cost, which is that you're going to take a massive hit on the kind of performance you can get on tasks for which parallelism is infeasible, or for which you don't have any programmers who are good enough at parallelization to do it (effectively the same thing).  In those situations, you're going to be stuck watching one lone core play ""Little Engine that Could"" while all the other cores are dozing off like the lazy bums they are.<p>Meanwhile it solves a problem that I'm not convinced really exists.  Time-multiplexing relatively beefy CPUs is pretty much a solved problem.  Less so if you need real-time, but for everyday use there's really not much need to segregate processes to different cores when pre-emptive multitasking has been around on consumer systems for decades.",1342707843

I'm going to go ahead and spoil this one for you: the reason Walt wouldn't take that money was because in his view <i>it was already his money</i>.  In Walt's opinion (and maybe he's right) those rich people built a company completely on his ideas and cut him out.  Instead of struggling with two dead-end jobs trying to provide for a family <i>he</i> should be driving expensive cars, have a huge house, library, etc.  They are living the life that is, by rights, his and he sure as hell isn't going to beg for a small portion of that stolen money back.<p>IMO the show is about a good man being changed by life situations into an evil person and watching how he deals with it.  The twist is; Walt had already changed before the first episode.  He was once a good, moral, optimistic person but the betrayal by his brother, the years of slogging away in public school, having to get on his knees and scrub rich kids cars had changed him.<p>He became an evil, violent killer.  But he was sharing a body with ""ghost Walt"": that good man from before.  Ghost Walt wouldn't accept what Walt has become.  This is basically how the whole series plays out.  In the beginning Walt thinks he's completely pure and only does bad when he convinces himself to.  For example when he makes a list of why he needs to kill crazy 8.

This kid is genuinely excited and interested which, is extraordinary. I love seeing youngsters getting excited about science.<p>Unfortunately, this blog post and the one it claims as a source [1] are rather fluffy on details. Justin organized this information and presentation for the Intel Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) [2]. More details about the process he discovered can be found on the ISEF 2012 profile page [3] and for those who don't want to follow the trail, I've reproduced it here:<p>""Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate of 5.5%. One reason for this is the lack of a rapid, sensitive, inexpensive screening method. A novel paper sensor is described that simply, rapidly and inexpensively screens for pancreatic cancer. Mia Paca cells overexpressing mesothelin, a biomarker for pancreatic cancer, were cultured; mesothelin was isolated, concentrated and quantified with ELISA. After optimization with the Western Blot assay, the antibody to human mesothelin was dispersed with single walled carbon nanotubes. This dispersion was used to dip-coat strips of filter paper, rendering the paper conductive. Optimal layering was determined using a scanning electron microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was applied to the paper biosensor. Change in electrical potential was measured before and after application and a dose-response curve was constructed with an R2 value of 99.92%. In vivo tests on human blood serum obtained from healthy people and patients with chronic pancreatitis, PanIn, pancreatic cancer revealed the same trends.. The sensors limit of detection was found to be 0.156 ng/mL, satisfying the limit of 10 ng/mL, the level considered an overexpression of mesothelin consistent with pancreatic cancer. The sensor costs $3.00; 10 tests can be performed per strip. A test takes 5 minutes and is 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than ELISA, 25% to 50% more accurate than the CA10-9 test and is a sensitive, accurate, inexpensive, and rapid screening tool to detect mesothelin, a biomarker for pancreatic cancer.""<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680194/meet-the-15-year-old-who-is-changing-how-we-test-for-cancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680194/meet-the-15-year-old-who-...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.societyforscience.org/isef/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.societyforscience.org/isef/</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://apps.societyforscience.org/intelisef2012/project.cfm?PID=ME028&CFID=28485&CFTOKEN=10931553"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.societyforscience.org/intelisef2012/project.cfm?...</a>",1342707173

You restore my faith that it is possible to have a reasonable conversation around here.<p>This leads me to a question: Do mathematicians actually try to analyze primes by looking at a function that is created by combining a set of sine waves where there is one sine wave for each integer, on order to form a sieve out of the sine waves? E.g., creating a function that crosses zero only at each composite, or some such? Or is this visualization only suggestive of a broad approach?<p>The paper cited by the visualization is clearly attempting to do what I just described, but it appears to be the work of an amateur, and I don't read Spanish, so I can't really tell if this approach is on sound footing. I tried to Google around looking for this approach referenced in something more authoritative, but couldn't find any. I did find plenty of references to trying to analyze the function that you get from subtracting x/ln(x) from the prime staircase, using Fourier transforms and the like. But I can't see a direct connection between these approaches, other than the general inspiration of trying to break the problem down into a combination of sine waves.

BouncyCastle java source code is used (slightly tweaked for performance) - it is compiled into JS using Google's GWT compiler.<p>2. flash is only used for triggering file save dialog, similarly to downloadify, in browsers that do not support HTML5 alternatives. In Chrome, which supports <a download>, flash is not used (100% JS/HTML5)<p>3. problems mentioned in the post you referenced can be generalized into two groups: (a) hijacking the server to serve ""trojaned code"", and (b) inherent JS limitations such as the absence of proper PRNG.<p>Concern (a) is valid. However, most client systems have auto-updating software products installed, with auto-updating enabled (browsers auto-update themselves; anti-viruses and OSes do the same, etc. - the Flame worm was using Windows Update to sneak in, I think). It is a universal issue in the modern ""connected"" world, and most users have to live with this threat if they want to use the Internet in any meaningful way; I can't imagine a person eyeballing the source of every patch they compile/apply on their system.<p>Concern (b) is not really valid now, IMHO. As mentioned above, it is possible to use a solid open-source crypto library either directly (e.g. Stanford Crypto JS library) or compile one into JS, to use proper PRNG, etc. With proper testing (standard/published test vectors; cross-platform tests - encrypt in JS and decrypt in java, etc.) it is possible to make good crypto in JS.

4623419,comment,4623231,4623231,15,0,Zenst,,,"""Europe has trailed America for decades, partly because of a tricky environment for entrepreneurs.""  Disagreeing with that from the start or the article.  It realy depends upon what industry you look at, many sucessful entrepreneurs all around the World.  Some countries are more suited to enableing them in one area as apposed to other countries and also the feild.  Writting books, software and alot of inventions can be done with a extreemly low startup cost.  So without clearcut examples it is hard for me as a European to understand.  I will accept VC/finance may be easier or was easier in America for some feilds and still is, but a entrepreneur is by definition somebody who trancends the limitations that are normal and as such stands out.<p>Goverments with regards to getting involved in Buisness do it in many ways, grants for research helps in a area that creates buisness's without directly doing so.  Buisness's that are well extablished and come to a country can deal with goverments for TAX breaks, no startups/new companies can realy do that or leverage that area of govermentale assistance, they get breaks like all new companies.<p>As for the rest of the article is is realy just focusing lossly upon technology and offers nothing tangable to highlight things.  If it had a interview with somebody who tried to setup a technology company in europe and then endedup going to america to do things as it was easier, then the article would have made more sence and of had a good example.<p>Given the author was involved with Messagelabs who's HQ is located in the UK and not the USA, then I would of expected more references to the direction the article takes. More so as that company would seem to highlight against the article as it was started in the UK, grew well, sold to Symantic for large pile of 's and not $'s indicating a succesful startup in a country thats in Europe.<p>So again can see why I disagree on many levels with this article, sorry.",1349621269

4623406,comment,4623153,4623153,1,0,its_so_on,,,"1. <i>(""risk-free"" versus asymmetric wrt market rates of return)</i><p>i'm completely with the quoted response ""Entrepreneur: Its difficult to accurately describe the company, myself, and everything else in a single paragraph. To write something so small but somehow include every important aspect is near impossible, if not impossible. My company is too complex to be described in a single paragraph.""<p>let's get formal.<p>there is a market theory of efficiency which says that it is impossible to make investments that have a higher rate of return than the ""risk-free rate of return"", without taking on commensurate risk.  according to that theory, it is impossible for someone to find gold bullion stuck in some part of their property that requires extraction, and therefore to offer any investor (even semi-outside) a 200% rate of return on putting up some money to help them get it out, so you can sell it.  If you offer a 200% return, that means you're asking them to take a huge risk on losing the money they put up, acccording to that theory. (Due to the sole fact that 200% is more than some arbitrarily-defined ""risk-free"" rate of return backed by the government or whatever else the theoretician chooses as the basis for the risk-reward trade-off.  simplifying here slightly.)<p>that theory is wrong.  the example above makes it obvious.<p>it also makes it clear that the ""investor"" is both stupid, and wrong, to ask you to describe ""in a paragraph"" what you need the money for.  1 paragraph would be: ""I have some gold on my property and need to get it out"".  A real proposal includes an extensive history of you, your purchase of the property, its history, exact description of your discovery of the gold, the research you put into legalities, your detailed plan for extracting it and getting the investment back to the investor, market research into other people who have done this succesfully, even quotes from companies that have a proven history of doing this or being able to, and everything else, including why other investors aren't investing, why you aren't doing it with a bank loan, on your credit cards, or by working a job until you can afford the extraction, etc.  Among other things, you should obviously give a very compelling reason why you can't just raise enough money on your own to extract even in an expensive way, a small piece of the bullion, and then sell it to get the money to get the rest.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  You are saying something extraordinary: so, prove it.<p>Anyone who can offer anyone else more than 7-10% return annually should not be writing a paragraph about it.<p>2. <i>(truly successful investments)</i><p>the ""investor"" in this article might have some way to get a good return on his money.  but never a spectacular one.  let's get into this.<p>basically, this article is one in another in a around here which all repeat a mantra of not creating a pitch for a long-term, hugely succesful company, (giving extensive justification of how this is about to happen) but instead, in a quick little web site that can probably pay for itself and then make enough for a decent return on, at most, a few server's worth of investment.<p>This never works for identifying big, succesful companies.<p>How could any one paragraph, have explained why anyone should have invested in Google when it was some servers in stanford. a diamond in the rough.<p>This is their historic, contemporary paper on the answer to that question, to the basic question of what they were building: <a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a><p>As you can see it's a bit more than a paragraph.<p>even though it was a bit more than a paragraph, reading it is the only way you could have gotten in on that company, or separate it from others with different long papers that aren't worth investing in.<p>reading it is what allows you to get a better than risk-free rate of return.  you want one paragraph, here: ""This FDIC-insured bank account comes with a 1.7% annual interest rate.  we are one of the biggest retail banking instititions in america, you can trust us and the FDIC."" bam, done.<p>anything more than that - as explained in the analysis above, requires commensurately more justification and information.<p>i'm with the entrepreneur on this one.<p>-<p>this post is tagged #rational",1349620848

4623402,comment,4622472,4623384,3,0,Alex3917,,,"""Where did that number '95%' come from? I suspect you made it up.""<p>I don't think there is any research that has a single group of raters look at all of these categories at once, but there is a lot of research that looks at them separately. E.g. as I mentioned, ""According to a study published in JAMA, 11 percent of the articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals are written by 'ghost authors.' (And 19 percent of the articles named 'honorary authors' who had not contributed enough to the research and writing to justify being listed as authors.)"" That's up to 30% of all papers that are fraudulent right off the bat.<p>Because many of these categories have been looked at separately it's not hard to figure out that the total for all research has to be at least 95%. Also, if you look at what percentage of papers can't be replicated:<p><a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528826.000-is-medical-science-built-on-shaky-foundations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528826.000-is-medica...</a><p>It's clear that the vast majority of research seems to be just made up out of thin air to begin with. And the percentage of research that can be replicated but that is fraudulent in some other way is similarly high. What it comes down to is that much if not most of modern science is basically just a giant make-work program for pseudo-intellectuals that's designed to produce marketing propaganda for corporations and prevent political unrest.",1349620755

4623400,comment,4623220,4623289,5,0,dasil003,,,"I realize this is orthogonal to your point, but when it comes to knowledge work, <i>especially</i> startup work, I'm highly skeptical of any prescriptive approach to hours worked.<p>Optimal hours is of scientific interest, but I think someone in a startup even thinking about this is a bad signal.  Instead ultimate productivity is more closely related to how focused they are when they are actually working.  It's easy to spend 16 hours a day in the office and fritter it away with a million small but unimportant tasks.  Likewise, if you come in and get in the zone for 6 solid hours, you might be able to create something of much larger value than anything the multitasker achieved in a frenzied and overworked 80-hour week.<p>Of course the holy grail is combining a high degree of focus with extended hours, but you can't manufacture this.  This is probably the best argument for hiring young idealistic people over seasoned veterans it that they are more likely to naturally put in a lot more hours.  However, even unspoken peer pressure to stay in the office is going to be counterproductive, ideally you want people to work as long as they are productive and then unplug completely  to recharge quickly.  If you get it right and create the right kind of excitement and intrinsic motivation then you can get large gains of subconscious problem-solving as well.",1349620745

Sure, Android systems tap into existing Google products for some features, but this is not exclusive.

2747207,comment,2746698,2747074,7,0,flogic,,,"I wouldn't call either Haskell or Scala academic. However, here a quick shoot from the hip stereotyping of each.<p>Scala gives me the impression it wants to be Java's C++. C++ is largely an extension of C. Sure you can use it entirely differently than C, but that C-ish core is still there. And Scala gives me that same feeling in relation to Java.<p>On the other hand, Haskell suffers from being a ""pure"" language. I mean ""pure"" in a wider sense than ""functional"". I mean ""pure"" as in being built entirely around a concept. For Haskell that concept is ""functional programming"". For Lisp, it's the ""cons cell"". And for Forth, it's the ""stack machine"". The benefit to being a ""pure"" language is there are all sorts of synergies you can take advantage of. The down side is when something doesn't quite line up, it gets ugly fast.",1310280199

2747173,comment,2746698,2746890,4,0,rdtsc,,,">  I do really wish the designers had a bit more erlang experience.<p>I feel the same way. I had this hope that this would be what I would learn instead of Erlang. You know it has goroutines and channels -- kind of like processes and casts. Well except that it is not the same. Erlang's processes that have explicit pids and messages are cast to those processes  by referring to their pid, make a lot more sense to me than a bunch of channels. Maybe it is just me, but I really just prefer the Erlang way. (Is the the ""actor"" vs ""CSP"" paradigms?).<p>Then it is what you mentioned, exit signals. Anyone who wants to promote concurrency as first order feature in the language and expects it to be useful in the real world, would have to have something like supervision trees & OTP. In other words when you have lots of little goroutines doing stuff concurrently, it is expected some will just crash and then you'd want to do something reasonable, which is not always to just crash the whole application (OS process).",1310278336

2747170,comment,2746698,2746698,26,0,supersillyus,,,"No syntactically lightweight way of writing anonymous recursive functions? I can't make myself care about that; I just spent 30 seconds trying, and failed. That's just not a use case worth optimizing for in a practical systems language.<p>Also, it's true that the Go spec doesn't guarantee tail calls are optimized.  If Go were designed to be a functional language, that'd be problematic. However, guaranteeing TCO isn't free in implementation, and in the presence of features like ""defer"", it becomes non-trivial to understand when it is happening. So, while I like TCO as much as the next guy, I agree with the Go designers decision not to require it. Just like with a pile of other languages, the lack hasn't stopped people from writing good code, and not even stopped them from writing useful recursive code. I think there's some code in the Go standard library (parsing code, mostly) that uses trampolining to simulate it, and that code would be better off if it could just do a tail call, but on the balance that code still works well and isn't convoluted.<p>Anyway, not a bad blog post; I agree with most of it. But, as someone who has written a fair bit of code in functional languages and a fair bit of Go, I find that the more Go I write the less I care about the language features (or lack thereof) that I was horrified by at first, and the more I see most other languages as overcomplicated. Go isn't a very good language in theory, but it's a great language in practice, and practice is all I care about, so I like it quite a bit.",1310277967

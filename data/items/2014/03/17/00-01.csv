For instance, he pointed to a paper published this February in Nature Biotechnology which shows that GM corn sometimes out-produces conventionally bred corn and sometimes under-produces in comparison. The key is in the environmental context. The years where GM corn was producing similar or lower yields than conventionally bred corn were average years, when it came to factors like the weather, disease, and pests. It was in bad years that you can see a significant, positive, difference for GM corn. When the situation was bad, GM corn had greater yields.<p>From <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2013/03/29/do-gmos-yield-more-food-the-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2013/03/29/do-gmos-yield-more-food-the...</a><p>Then there&#x27;s of course Golden Rice which has an increased content of Vitamin A, which you can&#x27;t measure in terms of yield.",1395017907

I&#x27;ve learned far more than I would hacking on someone else&#x27;s legacy code (unless I had the privilege of working on the legacy code of truly great engineers I respect) or by being told what to build and how to build it (again, unless that person happens to be brilliant at making those types of decisions).<p>Those who work at startups should do so for the same reason that people who work long hours on open-source projects do so; they are makers that are building something they believe should exist.",1395017525

I plan on doing this for 6 months and at that time if I&#x27;m not making enough money to keep the servers up I&#x27;ll have to switch back to a traditional model.<p>Here&#x27;s a recap of what has happened and what I&#x27;ve learned so far from my experience.<p>I&#x27;ve received some very positive feedback about my move away from traditional advertising to a donation based format. I&#x27;ve been contacted by numerous people in the industry ( NASA, etc. ) about this. They are truly intrigued and didn&#x27;t really understand how I was going to keep the lights on.<p>The BTC community has been overwhelmingly supportive through this transition as well. I&#x27;ve gotten so many PMs from people that have built systems for easier BTC integration and I&#x27;m truly grateful for that.<p>How much BTC has been donated so far?\nDay 1: I received 0.0125 BTC which equals ~ $8.00 USD.\nDay 2: 0.0015 BTC = ~ $0.95 USD\nDay 3: 0.00 BTC = $0.00USD\nDay 4: 0.00 BTC = $0.00USD\nDay 5: 0.00 BTC = $0.00USD\nDay 6: 0.00 BTC = $0.00USD<p>There are probably a few reasons for this. One is that after the initial post moved down the page less BTC influencers were coming to the site. My normal audience comes from links and Google so who knows if they user BTC at all.<p>This news doesn&#x27;t halt me one bit. I&#x27;m in this for a while and will continue doing what is right and what is good.\nLike I said before, this is still only a few days old so there will be design changes, traffic changes. I&#x27;m still 100% behind BTC!<p>Thank you for the donations, I really do appreciate it.",1395016840

The left is worse since they want unbridled socialism without any real investment in things that help the country complete globally and make the country wealthier. Furthermore, the left appoints  public servants to positions for which they have absolutely no competence. The presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso was excellent, and under his leadership lots of really capable people set us up for almost a decade of prosperity.<p>The Lula administration was somewhat reasonable, but set the foundation of appointing civil servants with no qualifications beyond knowing the right people. Only under the Dilma administration was this taken to its extreme, with most appointees having no capacity to do the jobs with which they were entrusted.<p>At the end of the day it all comes down to education (both in Brazil and pretty much every country). The country grossly under invests in education. People will elect the politicians they deserve and if they are under-educated, they tend to make atrocious voting decisions.<p>I was there from 2007 to 2011 and things were going pretty well, but it&#x27;s gone to total shit since 2010.

7412033,comment,7408576,7411574,3,0,pcwalton,,,">  Patrick, in your first paragraph you admit that there are breaking changes to Rust. Yet in your second paragraph you ask for evidence of the lack of stability? Your first paragraph provides the evidence that you&#x27;re looking for!<p>No, your first comment was saying that Rust will not stabilize <i>this year</i>. Your evidence is that Rust is not stable <i>now</i>. Of course Rust is not stable now; as I said, we&#x27;re making the biggest breaking changes <i>now</i> so that we don&#x27;t have to make them <i>later</i>.<p>> I think it&#x27;ll be safe to say that Rust is headed toward stability once you&#x27;ve committed to not making any more breaking language or library changes, you have a separate code branch receiving only fixes, there are releases available, and at least some assurance is given that any issues that do arise will at least be investigated for a reasonably long period of time.<p>That&#x27;s called &quot;1.0&quot;. Which is not finalized yet, but has a target date for this year.<p>> We&#x27;ll have to consider it a moving target, and we&#x27;ll have to continue inquiring as to when it will start to stabilize.<p>No, you will keep doing that because you&#x27;re trolling. But most people can tell the difference between &quot;stable now&quot; and &quot;in the process of stabilization&quot;. We have a set of issues for the 1.0 bug tracker and triage them regularly: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?direction=asc&labels=&milestone=20&sort=created&state=open"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?direction=asc&labels=...</a> We have also formalized an RFC process for language changes.

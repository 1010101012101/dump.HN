A journalist serves the people? What planet is this person living on? The journalists whose work I have occasion to observe, with a few and dwindling number of honorable exceptions, serve <i>power</i>.<p>The reason journalism is dying is that most journalists -- by which I mean most people making a living under that job title; who on earth is the author referring to? -- long ago discarded these values. Luckily we have the internet and a significant body of courageous bloggers (among, it must be said, a lot of garbagey ones) who actually do care about them, producing real critique, analysis, and even reporting, that for once does not insult the intelligence.<p>I must be missing something. Surely it's not possible for anyone to have their head <i>that</i> far up. Or maybe this is just what you get when the echo chamber succumbs to denial.<p>Edit: after surfing around a bit, I think it may be that the author is simply naive. I'd bet money that journalism ""training"" consists in good part of repeating such self-flattering bromides about journalists, and it sounds to me like the author is just repeating what she was taught. She probably doesn't deserve my rant, but the ""journalists"" I'm thinking of certainly do, so I'm leaving it.",1279864707

(Granted, Kanji came before kana, but as far as 'purely Japanese' scripts I think that kana takes precedence). Thus it really doesn't fit well with the Japanese pronunciations because sometimes it was brought in for meaning (火山 vs 火) without any care for how it was pronounced -- either forcing the pronunciation to conform to the original Japanese word, or creating a new word from the Chinese.<p>Also the fact that Kanji entered japan at different points in history means that there were different interpretations of how the kanji should be used.

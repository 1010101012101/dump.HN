This, for many reasons, would be one such case (we can debate that through email if you want), but let's dismiss it anyway.<p>The important fact here is that bucket loads of (your) personal data are being processed, correlated with each other and stored into centralized server clusters — which have become very tangible assets.<p>If someone ill-intentioned — a government, an interest group, a company — gets a hold of these assets — through power, through craft, through acquisition — they can use it to target you for whatever their purpose.<p>In a warfare scenario, that could mean targeted, granular misinformation; targeted terrorism through AI-generated blackmailing, tailored on an infividual level; mass identity hijacking. It could make war a <i>personal</i> matter like it has never been before.<p>(And on the other side, there's the Nazi Germany scenario where, unbeknownst to you, you are being blacklisted for a genocide to come — after all, the first step is classification. [2])<p>The fact that we're living rather peaceful times doesn't mean that a potential weapon like these databases should go unregulated; and the fact that we see no storm in the horizon doesn't mean we shouldn't care about the possibility.<p>As long as you can imagine what sorts of bad things could be done with that personal data, the argument  is: you should care because you don't know for a fact what tomorrow will look like.<p>[1] If Wikipedia is to be believed, it's been 20 years now since Godwin's Law was first formulated!<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide...</a>",1319054171

You'll <i>want</i> that profile, because it'll save you lots of money.<p>People tend to worry that negative things will happen to them if information about them is used without their consent - for instance, your example might worry that his insurance premiums will go up because he's buying Wild Turkey in bulk and surfing pages on alcoholism.<p>This will never happen.<p>In reality, <i>positive</i> things will happen to people when they <i>freely consent</i> to share <i>positive</i> information about themselves - and as those people are rewarded, the pool of people who don't share becomes riskier and is therefore economically punished for not sharing.<p>Two examples that are with us today:<p>-- Car insurance. Students with better grades tend to have less accidents, so you can get a better insurance policy from your provider by voluntarily turning over your grades. Since turning over your grades is a simple thing, the result is predictable - if you <i>don't</i> turn over your grades, it's safe to assume you have bad grades (and therefore are an accident risk). You've kept your privacy, but your premiums are still going up.<p>-- College tuition. To qualify their kids for student loans and aid, parents have to supply full documentation about their income. Parents do so voluntarily, because it can only benefit them - but this means if you <i>don't</i> submit documentation about your income, the college can safely assume you have a lot of money, and you get charged the highest possible tuition. Keeping your income private could cost you tens of thousands of dollars a year.<p>When personal information starts being used for things like insurance premiums, Blue Cross won't be creeping through your credit card receipts without your permission - instead, they'll invite users to voluntarily share their web, purchase, or location history, and they'll use it to reward them with a discount. As more and more users do so and are rewarded for the healthy lifestyles reflected in their data, the body of people not bothering to share will get riskier, and their premiums will rise.<p>Same outcome, no privacy violations.",1319054024

You can drop all the power rails and push the quiescent current all the way to zero, but that loses the cache; so on resume those cache lines have to be refilled, which is work you don't have to do if you maintain power to the cache.  Which to choose has to do with how long the CPU will be active for, which depends in sensitive ways on the architecture of the whole system (how much work can be offloaded to the hardware vs. requires interrupt handling in the CPU, etc...).  But then of course those other hardware devices have their own power needs.  And there's further complexity due to multiple layers of cache, etc...<p>Balancing the whole thing is a big guessing game, and the guesses have to be made by the SoC vendors years before the actual product appears in the market.<p>My intuition, FWIW, is that the asymmetric idea is a non-starter.  It sort of exists right now: c.f. the ""baseband CPU"" (or all the DSP cores you find scattered around these things) in many Android designs, and the extra CPU is really just a huge resource waste.  The hardware people will never get this right.  Putting all the transistors into a single set of SMP cores gives up on the ability to tune things perfectly, but it puts the OS in control of things.  OS vendors are much closer to the problem and better positioned to make good guesses.",1319053519

That wasn't the problem.  The problem is who ultimately winds up owning that wealth and how much it's worth on the market.<p>It's true you can't just wave your magic jobs wand and ""create jobs,"" it's true that people gloss over the need to create wealth and eventually be profitable.

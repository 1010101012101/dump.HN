Banks borrow money for less than they lend it effectively guaranteeing a profit if properly and concervatively managed, and yet they have recently and repeatedly failed. In the process they have inflicted enormous harm to our economy and lives, but they have not shared a proportionate share of the costs. The costs they impose hardly justify the veritable monopolies banks are afforded by the laws and regulations which are very effective at preventing competitors from entering the market.<p>Now consider where the tyical HN reader comes down on these issues.

10223878,comment,10223472,10223472,0,0,unoti,,,"Probably the biggest surprise I&#x27;ve seen in my career as a team lead is how often people ostensibly work with the team, but actually want to see the team fail.  It sounds ridiculous, I know, but it actually happens quite often.<p>Here are two quick examples where I see this happen often.  Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a vendor deploying software at an organization, and one or more people that work at your client organization originally wanted to write their own solution for this software, and their bosses overrode their wishes, and now they&#x27;re forced to help implement your software.  You need to use those disenfranchised IT people as part of your team to do the implementation, but they&#x27;d like to see the project fail, because they told their manager they could do it better themselves.  Other variations of this occur whenever someone doesn&#x27;t get their way, and is forced to go implement things a different way -- now any delays that happen may demonstrate their sage wisdom in not wanting to do it this way.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen variations on this same theme where a company is working on a product that does what we&#x27;re implementing, but it&#x27;s not ready yet.  Then a year down the road, when we&#x27;re doing the final rollout, their product is almost ready, so now they&#x27;d like to see us fail.  And suddenly the alliance falls apart.  Over the last 30 years working in IT, I&#x27;ve seen something like 20-30 variations on this theme.<p>Lots of times you need to work with people who really want to see your project fail.  This came as a huge surprise to me, but I think any senior person should be careful and on the lookout.  It&#x27;s often a significant project risk, and almost always overlooked.",1442361496

10223854,comment,10219727,10223607,0,0,ckozlowski,,,"To build on this and a number of the other comments in here:<p>There are two general types of sonar. Active, and Passive. Passive sonar involves the process of listening for signals, categorizing their type and origin, and determining their range and bearing. This is a difficult task, though the world&#x27;s most sophisticated navies can perform this well. It is the preferred method of detecting other submarines (or for submarines to detect other vessels) because it does not give away the location of itself.<p>Passive of course, has limitations. Variations in water conditions and temperatures, silencing techniques used in adversary craft, a limitations of one&#x27;s own equipment can make passive difficult, if not impossible in some conditions. And even then, it is a best guess at detection. Passive sonar will give you a pretty close approximation under good conditions and a &quot;well, he&#x27;s out there&quot; in the worse. (In the most high-tech vessels, it&#x27;s a bit better than this, but I think I have the gist)<p>Active on the other hand, is precise. Very precise. It also means, the gig is up, because the emitting craft is heard by everyone, extremely clearly. An active ping that gives a good return can give you precise range and bearing, and in some cases, velocity. It&#x27;s of limited range, so typically submarines will hunt with passive and use active in the closing stages of an engagement.<p>Typically when I read about active sonar harming wildlife, it&#x27;s in reference to the large active arrays carried by destroyers and submarines. Active is used by sonobouys, navigation equipment, and torpedoes as well, but these are typically lower power output.<p>The active array on a warship however, is generally massive, especially on a modern attack sub. They&#x27;re powerful, and will produce pings against objects at thousands of yards. (I&#x27;ve even read that some British subs, such as the Trafalgar class, can bounce a signal off the bottom of the seabed, and get a return on a distance object from the reflected bounce.)<p>These massive arrays are important, because if you suspect an adversary has been tracking you passively, but you can&#x27;t find them, then active scan can save you by alerting you to where they are. Tactically, it is a last ditch option, or the closing move in an engagement, and it&#x27;s not unusual to see a safety cover over the switch to an active array. But it does have a purpose, and the Navy, justifiably so, does need to train with it.<p>But it does come with a cost, and it won&#x27;t take long for one to search google for images of whale and dolphins with their ears literally blown to shreds because of an active scan.<p>I sympathize with both sides on this one, and I&#x27;m glad a settlement was reached that hopefully produces a good compromise.",1442361162

Or in other words, given the same chemical concentration the net half-life of the remaining nuclear waste would be on the same timescale as the of uranium ore.<p>The most abundant uranium isotope us U238, with a half life of about 703Ma. Here&#x27;s a list of half-lifes of the most common fission and spallation products:<p><pre><code>    99Tc 	211ka (side note: used as radioactive tracer nuclear medicine)
    126Sn 	230ka
    79Se 	327ka
    93Zr 	1.53Ma
    135Cs 	2.3Ma
    107Pd 	6.5Ma
    129I 	15.7Ma
</code></pre>
Three things to note here:<p>- Those are all isotopes, which you can&#x27;t actively &quot;break down&quot; further without making things worse. A couple of those above are very efficient at neutron capture, thereby getting slightly more radioactive, still not enough to significantly shorten the half-life.<p>- Those are still about 1000 to 20000 times more radioactive than U238, so it&#x27;s a far cry to call that &quot;comparable to uranium in a reasonable timeframe&quot;<p>- We&#x27;re definitely in the Ma timescale here. Say you want that nuclear waste decay down to 0.1% of the original material. How long does it take? Easy enough to figure out: 0.001 > 2^-n → n = log2(1000) =~= 10. Or in other words, it takes 10 half life periods for the stuff to break down to a concentration, that&#x27;s still far from being homeopathic.<p>When it comes to technology <i></i>IMHO<i></i> a reasonable timeframe to deal with technological aftermath is 50 years (and not more). Anything beyond that and it will become a clusterfuck simply due to &quot;human nature&quot;. Heck, today we&#x27;ve even got problem erecting structures that will last longer than 50 years without requiring major maintenance. And if you&#x27;re honest about it, except for the few outliers of historical significance (the pyramids, port walls built by the Romans with their &quot;super concrete&quot; we still haven&#x27;t reverse engineered, and such) we humans are quite terrible in building stuff that can go by without maintenance for more than a few decades.<p>And that&#x27;s the core problem in nuclear waste management. A problem I&#x27;d like to point out, we <i>have</i> to solve, because there&#x27;s already plenty of nuclear waste around.<p>Oh and then there&#x27;s of course the problem how to treat and prepare the highly radioactive waste for long term storage in the first place. One of the proposed methods (and already employed by some nuclear energy companies) is to melt it into glass. But here&#x27;s the problem: Glass is a quite complex material and its mechanical properties largely depend on its chemical composition. Radioactivity however means, that the chemistry is changing over time.

The fundamental issue is really making sure that a new party is authentic and not the equivalent of a fake account of an existing party.<p>You could come up with something like the process when verifying a domain for a certificate, creating a special DNS entry or serving some specific content at a specific address. This doesn&#x27;t really work because nobody stops you from registering arbitrarily many domains, it is just meant as an example that the process does not necessarily require a central authority.<p>But there is a hard problem here, who is a party and gets one vote? Could a bank just create ten shell companies and then obtain eleven votes? Bitcoin kind of sidesteps this problem by implicitly declaring you a separate party if you possess some mining hardware and weighs your voting power by the hash rate of your hardware.<p>So you are definitely right, Bitcoin achieves a degree of distribution that is probably really hard to do without a trusted central authority that has the power to decide who is a separate party and who is not.<p>If the number of parties is small you could maybe still do it in a distributed way with some manual work. If a new bank wants to join they broadcast a request, use something like the mentioned DNS record to prove that the request is genuine and then all existing parties have to manually decide whether to accept or reject the new party and cast a corresponding vote.

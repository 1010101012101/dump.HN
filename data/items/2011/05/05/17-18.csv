The only things I can think of to really change (looking at the scroll bars on this window right now) are: 1. disappear when content fits in the window instead of grayed out scroll bars; and 2. Get rid of the vestigial up and down arrow buttons.<p>Last time I saw something really horrible done with scroll bars was in Google Wave. What a disaster.<p>Here I feel like Apple seems to be having issues because they're trying to form a consistency between iOS and OSX, but there's an inherent tension in that iOS is a direct manipulation metaphor, and OSX can't really be.<p>It goes both ways. On iOS, they're running out of input bandwidth that's strictly metaphorical, so they're now resorting to gestures, which are out of metaphor and not discoverable.<p>On OSX Lion, scrolling is immediately inconsistent with iOS, because, of course, it's not a direct manipulation metaphor, so there's already an extra level of abstraction, and you scroll with two fingers instead of with one. Because of that level of abstraction, the direction is basically arbitrary, though I suppose it makes it slightly more consistent with iOS, in that you're (in a +1 remove) pulling on the content like in iOS, instead of pulling on the scroll bar.<p>But not showing the scroll bar by default is especially weird to me, in that the constraint for iOS--screen real estate--doesn't really exist on a desktop environment. Why not provide that information, then? Consistency over usability is my guess.<p>""A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.""",1304617743

Furthermore, later evidence has shown how terrible the evidence was for ""Vaccines cause autism"". The study that started this controversy was ridiculous. It used a ridiculously low sample size, the scientist conducting it (Andrew Wakefield) had severe conflicts of interest that basically lead to fraud, and to top it all off, the journal that original posted the paper retracted it.",1304615265
2518088,comment,2517296,2517296,9,0,mekoka,,,"Another thing that I'll start to experiment with is delayed confirmations.<p>The confirmation step via emails is one of those things that has been copied over and over, without knowing, in many cases, what problem it addresses in the first place and if it's crucial to one's particular situations.<p>I think having to interrupt your visit to log into your email, is another speed bump to a smooth registration process.<p>A better approach, in my opinion, would be to let users just start interacting with your service right away. Give them 5 to 7 days to confirm their account, after which it is automatically suspended. You can let them know the next time they try to login that they never actually clicked the link they received via email a week earlier. The timeframe is long enough that they can actually use the service with no hassle and it's short enough that they won't have forgotten which email and password they gave during registration.<p>Of course, if the operations they're trying to perform in your site are sensitive enough (e.g. purchase, sale), you should let them know that it requires an immediate confirmation of the email address.<p>Other unrelated advices:<p>- if you use the email as a login name, then allow users to have whatever handle they'd like. i.e. don't make the username unique. Also, allow spaces in that field. e.g. StackExchange.<p>- under no circumstance should you keep an unencrypted record of the password. It's tempting to think that in the name of user friendliness, whenever someone loses their password, you will just send it back to them. As soon as I see my password sent to me in an email, I usually logon to the website, change the password to 12345 and depending of the sensitivity of the data kept by the service (e.g. web hosting), I would consider stopping using it altogether (Ironically, I've had cases of websites telling me that 12345 as a password isn't secure enough for their service, after they'd sent me my password via email).",1304615211

Inevitably I just copy what I wrote in the first box into the second.<p>You have to type it twice, because you don't see what you typed the first time -- it's a validation.<p>You don't see what you typed the first one, because that's ""standard practice"" for passwords, so that no one looking over your shoulder will see the password you typed.<p>That makes sense sometimes -- e.g., when you register for your new gmail at a starbucks. For me, 99.9% of the time, that's not an issue -- I'd much rather have a checkbox that says ""press here to hide password"".<p>But that's the standard practice.",1304615104

You always need access to email to get access to a website. This means that for whatever reason you don't have email access, you are locked out of all sites.<p>2. While it works from a security standpoint, you still add overhead to the users task. Users have to go between website and email and back to website just to log in.<p>3. slow connections might make the task even more cumbersome since you now add the delay of checking emails just in addition to logging into the website.",1304615031

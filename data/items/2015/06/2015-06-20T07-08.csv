9749324,comment,9745149,9749124,0,0,demallien,,,"This accurately catches the reasoning behind my approach to testing though. When you fix a bug, write a test that reproduces the bug first. That way, when someone tries to refactor the messy code, they&#x27;ll know that they broke something that was causing a real big.<p>I generally try to have two type of test: nominal &quot;happy case&quot; tests that verify basic functionality of modules when used in a normal way, and bug fix tests that are labelled as such, with a reference to the bug in the bug tracking system. So now when you see my warty code and try to clean it, the test fails, and you can even find a description of the original problem that the warty code addresses. Now you know that you either have to find a cleaner solution, or just leave the warty code alone.<p>This system means that most of the tests I write are targeted at things that really cause bugs, not just busy-work testing of things that would never go wrong, but rigidify code bases (the more tests you have, the more you have to modify when refactoring, and how do you know if the test or the code is wrong during the refactor???)",1434786986

I wish Eclipse had better debugging (actually it seems it has, since it&#x27;s also new to me, the curve for learning it is much steeper - I&#x27;m an ex - Visual Studio Debugger guy :)).<p>But even with SourceMaps gwt translated (from java->javascript) names do not always match - often _g or _0 _$ are added, and object properties are intermixed with original java defined ones, and some internal - I&#x27;m used to it now, but was wondering whether it would&#x27;ve been better if it work ideally (e.g. show real Java &quot;view&quot; of the things even from the &quot;Javascript&quot; land). While this might&#x27;ve been the right choice, what I have now gives me more usable information.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work always, is that sometimes the debugger would display the javascript, not java code (maybe gwt&#x27;s fault, or something I do incorrectly with gwt&#x27;s SuperDevMode )<p>I wish there is an option (for gwt, and other languages) to somehow show the transition, and allows intermixing when displaying. To give you an example - When debugging &quot;C/C++&quot; code most of the debuggers can intermix the assembly generated code in there... I&#x27;m not sure whether this would be as good as intermixing java and javascript (or say another language with javascript) because they look very similar, but at least to allow me to sometimes see the javascript, rather than always show me the java code (it&#x27;s possible that this is already available, and I haven&#x27;t found it yet).",1434785902

I am old enough to still remember paper ballots in India. Imagine having to count of the order of 600 million(!) votes. Each with potential challenge from a partisan, validation, security. The costs and logistics were a nightmare. After polling, it used to take days just to get all the ballot boxes to centralized counting arenas. The machinery for the counting alone endedup involving about a million people!<p>India has very strict election codes - how many voters to a booth (few hundreds), how far a voter can be required from his place of residence to polling station (3 miles max), etc. We also do not require &quot;registration&quot; before polling like in the US for example. Once you are 18 and have obtained a voter ID, you can simply walk into a polling booth on the day and vote.<p>Indian Election Commission took a pioneering lead in using technology for polling - We have had near-universal electronic polling for 25+ years now. The trouble with the &quot;moderm&quot; voting machines is that they are way to complex and try to do too much. Indian design went the other way. Security of paper ballots was already an understood and mostly solved problem. The machines are simple - more in the league of a 8-bit microcontroller with 16 push buttons and 4x7 segment LED display. <i>very</i> old school. The machines rely on physical security. They cannot be opened without breakage, physical seals can be applied to their &quot;reset&quot; and &quot;count&quot; buttons, and access to them is controlled the same way as access to paper ballots and boxes would have been controlled.  This allows even a poor country to deploy the order of half a million voting machines!<p>There are of course issues - there is no paper trail for example, which as a concept has never even arisen in Indian electoral design debates. I am not sure I am myself sold on the need for them - I do see the importance, but its not an absolute.<p>EVMs built on top for high end PCs, with Windows and millions of lines of custom code, manufactured by people who also build Slot machines (in the US atleast) is at least to my mind - simply another case of overdesign and overspending - typical of defence and government contracts. When security, reliability, are concerned, simplicity and even non-technical solutions combined with technology work better than compicated technology.",1434785181

Basically every company I&#x27;ve worked had a similar process in place (often lead by the CEO) - this process does not scale & it will cause technical debt to your engineering team.<p>For all I know, this guy may actually be some product visionary, but why isn&#x27;t he telling this vision to designers to create the mocks so the intricacies are worked out before it gets to build?

Neither of these should be trusted with foundations of the democratic vote.<p>On the latter subject: because the transparency of the voting process is so fundamental to democracy, most countries had laws in place that first needed to be scrapped or mutilated to allow voting machines in the first place. The people who wrote these laws were neither stupid nor Luddites.<p>Ironically, we&#x27;ve always send observers to third world countries and former dictatorships to judge whether their elections are truly free and democratic, using criteria that would never allow for voting machines to obfuscate the process. For starter, it would make such neutral observation pointless.<p>I&#x27;m lucky I live in country (Netherlands) that has abolished voting machines years ago. (After a campaign against them led by by old school hackers.)<p>(There&#x27;s one movement in the Netherlands that openly advocates a return to voting machines. This movement is lead by Dutch mayors. The Netherlands is rather unique in the fact that mayors are not elected but appointed by political manoeuvring, which has been subject of debate for a long time. I do not believe these things to be a coincidence.)",1434784615

I think pico-iterations would be wonderful, and that is the big problem -- we meet twice a week (he has dedicated 4hrs a week and sometimes not even that.)  Way too much time goes by before we test whether the build-out matches the vision.  This makes it more disheartening because there is often so much wasted work.<p>However, I&#x27;m glad this worked out well for you -- I am going to try to split the 4hours more evenly, perhaps into at-least a daily review.  Part of the problem is he seems to think we are all wrong in requiring all these reviews, rather we should simply implement the vision rather than just talking about it over and over.",1434784238

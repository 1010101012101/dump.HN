I can't remember who it was but a few years ago a player was running for the ends zone and had a huge lead on the defense, 1 yard from the end zone he started running sideways draining as much clock as possible, assuring no come back from the opposite team.<p>I saw I believe Leon Washington for the Jaguars pull a similar stunt once, the D seemed to be giving him a free TD at the end of the game but he preferred to just take a knee right before the end zone.

I'm sick and tired of people shaming everyone for getting a ""useful"" education.<p>I'm <i>all</i> for education reform - note in my original post I mentioned that comprehensive education died when it got too expensive. But can we, for once, stop booing and shaming people who choose rationally within the existing system? Can we also stop giving people excuses for choosing poorly within <i>this</i> system?<p>We have a society where it costs six figures to get a degree. This is a damn shame and should be fixed. But <i>knowing this</i> people <i>still</i> get degrees they can't afford, and then tell a sob story to the press about how their $100K+ degree can't find them a job. Well, shit.<p>The solution to this problem is to make education cheaper, not to shelter and coddle people who are incapable of making a rational decision.<p>[edit] To address your point:<p>> <i>""Education plus time to think drives innovation.""</i><p>I agree, but I do think that we are inevitably returning to a state where education plus time to think are going to become rare luxuries. Our innovation will suffer as a result - <i>has already</i> suffered as a result.<p>But I don't think there's anything we can do to stop this. The US gained an incredible industrial lead over the rest of the world early on, which allowed to elevate its quality of life well beyond anything the world had seen, which in turn drove the wheels of innovation and invention.<p>But decades of mismanagement, rampant robber-baron capitalism, and simple globalization has meant that the US middle class is gutted. It's getting more and more desperate out there - more and more people working multiple jobs, more and more people making large cutbacks to their quality of life to make ends meet. This is a vicious cycle, to be certain, but I can't see how to stop it.",1322200348

3276315,comment,3276294,3276294,5,0,byoung2,,,"Are you asking whether you should negotiate your salary or not?  Then the answer is a yes every time.  Unless the offer made is higher than I was going to ask, I always ask for a higher salary.  For example, a few years back (my first full time job in programming), I was offered $50k and I really wanted $55k.  So I asked for $60k and let them offer to ""meet in the middle"" at $55k.  I negotiated a 10% raise in a 5 minute phone call.  That is the easiest raise you'll ever get.  Most people don't get a 10% raise after being on the job for a while unless it comes with a promotion (and additional responsibilities).  If you think being a new grad is a negative, try to spin it in a positive light.  Since you are fresh out of college, you are used to working with little sleep, meeting deadlines, and following instructions, and by definition you are still in ""learning mode"" so you can get up to speed quickly.  More experienced workers may be a little harder to mold into what they need.  In fact, they should pay more for these qualities.",1322199272

3276263,comment,3275698,3275698,5,0,loso,,,"I have always been a football fan but when I was in college I lived in the Football dorm and it changed how I saw the game forever. (Back story, I lived in those dorms because I'm a big guy and the coach wanted me to play for the team. I told him yeah because I noticed that at registration all of the Football players were able to skip in line. I never did play because I loved Basketball more than Football at the time).<p>Anyway, when you live around Football players 24/7 you start to learn facets of the game that you never knew about. You learn what every position is doing on every play and why they are doing it.Now when I watch Football it is more like a game of chess than a brutal grudge match. The real excitement in the game comes from watching the linemen and not the skilled positions.<p>On another side note, you would think that all of this football knowledge would help actual players when playing Madden (That was all that was played in those dorms. Hours and hours of Madden). It does but only to a certain extent. Football players take Madden too literally and try to play it as a simulation. They forget the video game part. I would use that to my advantage all of the time.",1322197254

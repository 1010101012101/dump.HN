8456050,comment,8455651,8456016,0,0,simplemath,,,">Our statistical analysis of the reproduction number of EVD in West Africa has demonstrated that the continuous growth of cases from June to August 2014 signalled a major epidemic, which is in line with estimates of the Rt above 1.0. Moreover, the timing of Rt reaching levels above one is in line with a concomitant surge in cases in Sierra Leone and Liberia. In a worst-case hypothetical scenario, should the outbreak continue with recent trends, the case burden could gain an additional 77,181 to 277,124 cases by the end of 2014.<p>Not good. R~2 is a deeply scary figure. R1.7 is better but still wildly explosive. 1.4 puts us in run of the mill &quot;ballooning epidemic&quot; territory.<p>The best case estimates of R-naught for Africa don&#x27;t have a whole lot of &quot;best&quot; about them.<p>Clearly the dataset outside Africa isn&#x27;t large enough to support meaningful analysis yet.

(Excerpted and linked below)<p>> I have never in my life had good relationships with mechanical objects of any sort. [...]<p>> About three years ago I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I was home one night. I called a meeting with my possessions. I got everything I owned into the living room. My toaster, my clock, my blender. They never been in the living room before. And I spoke to them. I opened with a joke. And then I said &quot;I know what&#x27;s going on, and cut it out!&quot; I have a sun lamp, but as I sit under it, it rains on me. And I spoke to each appliance, I was really articulate. Then I put them back, and I felt good.<p>> Two nights later I&#x27;m watching my portable television set, and the set begins to jump up and down, and I go up to it. And I always talk before I hit, and I said &quot;I thought we had discussed this, what&#x27;s the problem?&quot; And the set kept going up and down, so I hit it, and it felt good hitting it, and I beat the hell out of it. I was really great, I tore off the antenna, and I felt very virile.<p>> And two days later I go to my dentist in New York. I had gone to my dentist, but I had a deep cavity, and he&#x27;d sent me to a chiropodist. I&#x27;m going into a building in mid-town New York, and they have those elevators, and I hear a voice say &quot;Kindly call out your floors, please&quot;, and I say &quot;sixteen&quot; and the doors close and the elevator starts going up to sixteen. And on the way up the elevator says to me &quot;Are you the guy that hit the television set?&quot; I felt like an ass, y&#x27;know, and it took me up and down fast between floors, and it threw me off in the basement. It yelled out something that was anti-semetic.<p><a href=""http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/allen.htm#Mechs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/allen.htm#Mechs</a>",1413323638

There&#x27;s a point to be made there though that the &quot;damage&quot; the industry always crows about is less of a real thing (supposed damages higher than the country&#x27;s GDP, suing networked printers, that kind of thing.. these are not the actions of rational actors with facts on their side) and more of an excuse to be made for exerting greater control over culture.

8455874,comment,8454752,8455380,0,0,dasmiq,,,"Yes, short n-grams or skip n-grams were the primary method to improve recall, and yes, the problem is that you&#x27;ll have to examine more candidates--i.e., run slower.<p>Taking advantage of some (high precision) many-to-one hashes is a nice idea, which has the advantage of reducing the index size. Some people might be familiar with Soundex (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex</a>), a hashing scheme for English homophones designed in 1918 to be computable by hand. While Soundex in particular would probably lead to too many collisions, it would be fun to think about learning a better hash from data.<p>One thing we&#x27;re working on now is unsupervised learning of error correction models (in the form of probabilistic finite-state transducers) to be able to augment the index with some number of multiple hypotheses.<p>Further afield, an interesting open problem is the development of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) schemes for edit distance. Some work has gotten as far as Hamming distance and cyclic shifts of the bits: <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/papers/cyclicShifts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/papers/cyclicShifts.pdf</a><p>In the paper, our evaluation uses the &quot;pooling&quot; of the results of several different runs. This is similar to how recall is evaluated for information retrieval over large collections. For a given query to a web search engine, you don&#x27;t want to read the whole web to figure out what your recall is. Instead, you can take the union of the results from several different search engines and parameter settings thereof and evaluate the &quot;pseudo-recall&quot; of any one system with respect to that set (cf. Boggle). In our case, if we include some runs that take a long time but have higher recall, we can estimate performance on the more realistic parameter settings.<p>In addition, we&#x27;re also working on getting clean transcripts of a sample of newspapers so we can produce some more direct estimates, as well as train better error models.",1413321428

To say that they are all 100% rational actors is not accurate. Research has shown many times that people react differently based upon their environment.<p>One may see Tindr&#x27;s popularity happening for a different reason. Dating sites are a network effect business like no other. Tindr was very effective at their initial marketing push at colleges. Could it actually be Tindr&#x27;s very effective network building and marketing at the early stages that has to do with it&#x27;s success? Could it be that Tindr is closer to how college age daters work? And once the network effect took hold it spread to other demographics the mechanics were not the reason for it&#x27;s growth? I&#x27;m sure some will agree that much of OkCupid&#x27;s early success had to do with the fact that people just thought the quizes were fun. Plenty of people go to clubs with music they don&#x27;t really like because they want to meet new people and that is where the people are right now.<p>All of a sudden we might discover a situation where a platform is reinforcing gender stereotypes proactively. In many cases against the wishes of non trivial portions of their users simply because that is where the people are? This reinforcement can actually change the views of people outside an environment once they have spent significant time inside of it.<p>Unfortunately, all of this is a lot more complicated just like stereotypes are.

Variables are visible in the block they have been defined in, what could be easier to understand? Probably I am missing something, though...",1211877660
200794,comment,200698,200698,0,0,kogir,,,"Whether or not the suggested courses of action have any merit is not going to be a constructive debate, but the problem is real. People who really know what they're doing come up with the simplest solutions. Almost every time I've had someone suggest a really complicated solution to a problem (or been tempted to build one myself), I've found that after further thought there is a better way. In the few instances I've plowed forward, I've regretted it later.<p>The simplest solution is almost always the best one.",1211877591

Or just that, indeed, parents lie to kids so thoroughly that it has taken on a physical manifestation?<p>In any case, I have a free suggestion for the makers of Obecalp: run a TV ad on Saturday mornings.

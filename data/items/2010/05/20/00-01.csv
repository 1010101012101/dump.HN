1362912,comment,1359689,1360023,0,0,acangiano,,,"> Wow. I'm into screencasts, but I'd never heard of you!<p>We launched a month ago. :)<p>> I'm curious about the pre-order screencasts. How much planning did you do beforehand?<p>There is quite a bit of planning behind it:<p>* Only authors that we're familiar with and trust can do courses (as opposed to authoring a single screencast).<p>* Each author needs to be specific about what material they're going to cover in each lesson.<p>* Half of the royalties from preorders are withheld until the course is completed. This motivates authors to finish what they started, as well as giving us funds to handle emergency situations.<p>* We only release a course after work on the second lesson has been started. This helps us evaluate how long the first lesson took a given author. If it took too long, we won't start a course, but simply convert that lesson into a single screencast.<p>* We aim for a release of at least one lesson per month, give or take.<p>* When it comes to TDD and Python, these courses have been adopted/translated from our Italian catalog, where the fourth and fifth lessons, respectively, are being created at the moment. The Italian version of the Python course should be finished by the end of June, then it will be a matter of translation.<p>> Are you set up to do bulk refunds if you don't finish a series in a reasonable amount of time?<p>Creating a whole course takes a lot of time and work. It's akin to writing a large technical book. For this reason, we may disagree on the definition of ""reasonable amount of time"". What's sure is that if after a year, a course has yet to be completed, and a customer complains, we'll issue a partial refund or some form of ""store credit"".<p>Ultimately, we sincerely care about providing really good customer care, and strive to ensure that all of our courses end up being completed.",1274316679

1362898,comment,1362379,1362854,0,0,strlen,,,">  Like if an Intel manager comes up with an idea and asks an engineer to work up a prototype, surely it'd be illegal for the engineer to quit and work up that same prototype for a new chip-design startup instead?<p>Yet this is how many Silicon Valley (back when the valley was actually about Silicon) start-ups began. Generally, however, the pattern was engineer and manager would identify a business need that real customers have. They would attempt to build it as a ""pet project"", be stiffed by conservative and hunch-driven product organization and would then <i>both</i> quit and take a large chunk of the engineers along with them.<p>The reason this succeeded is that NDAs and non-competes are unenforceable in California. Law suits would still come (due to alleged theft of IP, which generally never happened) and be settled out of court for only a small proportion of the the equity the ""idea"" produced.<p>Personally, I will stand by my words. If you can't build your idea it's worthless (you can't estimate whether others can either). If everyone else can (welcome to web 2.0), it's worthless as well. Sure you may be able to sue somebody over your idea (but you generally have to have something more, like a claim of IP theft), but your lawsuit proceeds will be a fraction of what the person who ""stole"" your idea has made out of it. That $65mm doesn't change Zuckerberg's life _a single bit_ (not having another $65mm\nmight only make life easier for him, as that's one less bodyguard to hire to protect it).<p>On the other hand, if you have a genuinely new idea i.e., you have a new CPU architecture you invented but don't have the ability to build the prototype chip _all by yourself_ then one engineer quitting and competing with you won't succeed unless he _actually_ steals your design (this is real IP theft) and even then you'll likely outdo him (as he'll have a bug for bug copy of your design, whereas you actually understand the design choices).<p>If management wants to be rich, they have to treat engineers with utmost respect. There's difference between engineers  mere _coders_ who turn business requirements into code (usually by gluing software others have written together) and engineers. Spot the engineers early on, challenge them, give them autonomy and responsibility. Let them work on pet projects (Google calls it ""20% time"", but it's merely a codification of something successful companies had been doing before), tune your product vision with their data.",1274316235

The paragraph that follows those two tracks mentions Bach-like compositions, but the click-to-play boxes corresponding to that text are on the second page.<p>In particular, the two click-to-play tracks on the second page called ""Fugue"" are the two supposedly Bach-like tracks.<p>If, instead, you were referring to those two tracks, I'm wondering:  do you have much experience with Bach's fugues in particular?   When you strip away the interpretation that a live performer brings to Bach fugues, what is left is indeed very mechanistic, because the construction of the composition is largely based on starting with a theme, transforming it under various rules, and playing those transformations against each other.  With interpretation they can be sublime.   Rendering a satisfying interpretation of Contrapunctus I is among the most joyful experiences I've ever had at the keyboard.<p>But not all of Bach's fugues reach such great heights.

I'm not sure if I can make the distinction clear because I'm not a composer and the difference is subtle, but a variation on a theme will not be the same as the theme but is a fairly logical derivative of one, whereas a composition takes place on a 'blank slate'.<p>Now, of course this program - just like a real composer - works against a backdrop of the knowledge available about music of a given era. But when Bach wrote his first fugue it was a breakthrough, and even if after that each and every other fugue was linked back to that first one in a more or less direct way (some sound like close cousins, some are much further apart and some are different pieces altogether) then the act of creating such a variation is a composition of sorts.<p>But when a composer speaks of a 'variation', he does so in a subtly different way than an ordinary person would, to a composer a variation is 'obvious' given the first few bars of the variation and the original piece.<p>And that's what I'm getting at when I say these sound to me like variations. They're along an existing or at least familiar theme and they've changed. It's as though sampling has met classical music and it's bits of everything but not a 'whole' by itself.<p>This is very tricky to put in to words.<p>For a computer program though, it's definitely quite a step forward compared to the usual. Some of those pieces on the second page could have you fooled for a few seconds. The fact that some more modern composers make ear-splitting stuff doesn't help either because this computer program seems to be at least well ahead of some live humans :)",1274313712

So I read this thread with great interest.<p>We've found that like for like the Azure platform is very well priced and is actually less expensive than our current Ubuntu setup, as well as being cheaper than comparable high level Microsoft hosting providers.<p>We don't much like lock in either and for the parts of the Azure platform that will lock us in we're extracting the code into a wrapper so we can replace with the minimum of work should we need to switch hosting platform in a hurry. Database wise we're going with SQL Azure and their 10GB limit I find to be quite spacious for our needs, although that would depend entirely on what you're storing. I believe they have 50GB databases in the works for the near future?<p>The deployment times are an issue and I have heard similar, but again I believe if you upload the project yourself then request the update the deployment time is greatly reduced making it less of an issue. It would take some doing to match Capistrano deployment though which is simply awesome and something I will certainly miss.",1274313622

We get that locally, but not in the feed.<p>Edit -- that looks unclear upon rereading. When we see an article in the list on news.ycombinator.com, it looks like this:<p>Y Combinator a new twist on finding hot companies (mercurynews.com)<p>The same article in the RSS feed doesn't show the (mercurynews.com) part. It would be convenient to have that in the feed as well, so we know that we need to pop two new tabs for that article, rather than just one.\n",1176436280

3605824,comment,3605010,3605677,5,0,potatolicious,,,"In many ways, the industrial realm is still where the forefront of interface design is, and covers an area far wider than anything software hopes to do right now. In fact, I'd consider the industrial flavor of interface design to be far truer to ""interface design"" than what we see in mobile/web, which is often just ""graphics design"" in camouflage.<p>In industry, UI has consequences. A confusing readout may crash a plane and kill hundreds. A warning that doesn't trigger under expected circumstances can slice a man in two. A button that doesn't require enough force to push can accidentally decapitate. The list goes on. What you get from that side are incredibly usable, incredibly easy to understand, incredibly fault-tolerant interfaces... that are ugly as hell.<p>Whereas from the mobile/web side we often see pointlessly obtuse, absurdly minimalistic, confusingly designed interfaces that are works of art. We often confuse these with ""good interface design"" because they are different, new, and beautiful.<p>I really wish those of us in web/mobile can get off our high horses and learn a bit from un-sexy things like metal presses, diesel locomotives, and airplane cockpits.",1329533966

3605817,comment,3603799,3605647,5,0,jrockway,,,"It's very unlikely that a court would want any of that information and sign a warrant for it, so you don't have to worry about how Google protects your information from court orders.  If you boss writes Google and asks whether or not you're gay, that request is most likely going to be routed to /dev/null.  If your boss gets a warrant and a judge signs it, then that's another story.  Google has to comply with the law, after all.  So does Apple, Microsoft, and every other company in the world.<p>As for protecting your information from your friends, I think Google does a pretty good job in the situations you mention.  Google doesn't share your search history with anyone.  You don't have to pick a gender to use Google+.  You don't have to list your race, ethnicity, or religion.  And, Google+ provides a number of privacy controls so you don't inadvertently share your leftist feelings with your conservative boss.<p>The absolute safest way to protect information is to not disclose it to anyone.  That's all Schmidt is saying.  If you're planning to overthrow the government, don't post your plans to Google Docs.  If you're just worried that your boss won't like you, though, then you can be a little more relaxed, and share things via Google+ with close and trusted friends.  Then, the main attack vector is no longer through Google; the risk is that your friends will re-share something (offline or otherwise) that you didn't want them to.  And that's just life as usual.",1329533776

This essentially boils down to ""if you haven't done it, don't try since you're clearly not meant to"".<p>A defining feature of individuals with ADD/HD is a tendency to focus on immediate rewards versus long term goals.  \nThis doesn't mean that X-Box and weed are what the universe 'wants' for anyone, it just so happens it's what some (or many) people are wired to respond to.<p>Acknowledging the gap between our natural, immediate, impulses and our long term desires is part of being an adult, and part of being human.  We're capable of conceptualizing of and seeking a future that is not directly in front of our noses.  Just because you're not immediately drawn to something, or just because it doesn't ""feel"" good does NOT mean it isn't worth pursuing.<p>Apropos, a great Moneyball quote comes to mind :<p><pre><code>  Billy Beane: You don't know how to play first base.

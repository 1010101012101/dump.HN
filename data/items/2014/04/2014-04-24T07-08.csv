7638944,comment,7637278,7638790,2,0,danieldk,,,"Superior is indeed difficult to define. I think most Haskell libraries define far more elegant abstractions than their Java counterparts.<p>However, as a user of both Haskell and the JVM, there are some things to be said for the Java library ecosystem. For instance, the most widely-used Java libraries are often more mature, maintained better (usually because its authors are paid to do so), and more API-stable (for most of my Haskell code, a dependency version bump usually implies updating my own code). Of course, this is all reasonable, since the Haskell ecosystem exploded far more recently than Java&#x27;s. The older Haskell pages (bytestring, text, vector) tend to be very stable and predictable.<p>Another aspect where the JVM is currently ahead is VM monitoring. E.g. if there is a bottleneck, I can easily attach Visual VM or even my IDE to a running Tomcat and peek around. The JVM can do code hotswap (even more effectively with JRebel and LiveRebel).<p>Note: I posted this to provide some balance to the discussion. I believe Haskell is superior in many other respects, such as the type system, REPL-driven development, web frameworks with type-safe URLSs, etc.",1398326102

From a macro perspective I personally don&#x27;t think there is a bubble, part of the rationale is explained in Fred&#x27;s post.<p>What I think Fred is avoiding is the company-specific micro-view. In that case, I think &quot;yes&quot;, many late stage startups seem to be over valued, just by applying Fred&#x27;s yield logic (and growth-risk accounted for). Zynga was one of those companies (and obviously) we never heard how overpriced this was at IPO from Fred.<p>The valuation of these over valued startups seem to be driven by (i) increase in capital/competition from funds, (ii) eagerness by public markets to jump on the tech/startup bandwagon, and (iii) unrealistic &quot;believe&quot; that double-digit growth is sustainable for years to come.",1398323923

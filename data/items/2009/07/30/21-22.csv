If I walk out of the store with $100 of groceries for my family of 3, it's an entire shopping cart full of food and lasts for weeks!<p>4-5 lbs of ""on sale"" meat, 10 lbs of bread flour, 5 lbs of sugar, 2 lbs of cheddar, a gallon of milk, cereal (from local mill, not the national brand stuff), vegetables, butter and lunch meat will cost around $60 here in the Upper Midwest. But if I spend that $60 on mostly processed food, I will barely get two grocery bags full.<p>With a bit of land you can go further. I keep chickens for fresh eggs, but I realize most people can't do that. However, my potatoes, corn, carrots, broccoli, squash, pumpkins, salad greens and some herbs come fresh out of the garden so for summer/fall at least, I don't buy those things.",1248991036

If everyone's priority was to get off of the road as fast as legally possible, you could assume a uniform speed just below the limit. The only problem left to solve would be creating space between the vehicles and the approach you've mentioned would likely work well.<p>However, the road is full of people who are more concerned about watching the scenery pass, carrying on a phone conversation or looking for landmarks in unfamiliar territory. This is perfectly fine until traffic starts backing up behind them. As cars are added or lanes reduced away, a jam becomes increasingly imminent. And jams are just the extreme example.

733129,comment,732020,732940,0,0,1gor,,,"There is no point in arguing with the statements of today's facts. Such statements are also not very interesting, since they are common knowledge. What is interesting, is the dynamics and the direction of the change.<p>In all emerging market economies that managed to stabilize their currencies and make them appreciate (Latin America in the 90s) this has led to domestic consumer booms and reduction of current accounts surpluses (or running up deficits). China has not gone this route yet, but this is a massive reserve of growth. I am sure their leaders understand this. Of course, to focus on domestic market instead of exports, it represents a major policy change. But fundamentals increasingly point at this scenario, so we may reasonably assume that this is what will eventually happen.<p>I also do not buy the 'forced loans' concept. Throughout last years of rapid growth Chinese authorities have been in fact imposing artificial caps on domestic credit growth, since they don't have developed domestic debt market, and therefore lack effective tools to sterilize their dollar interventions. Immediately after financial crisis, the Chinese have removed many of those lending restrictions, as part of their 'stimulus'. Now, because of the developing stock market bubble in domestic Chinese stocks, the authorities are bringing the lending restrictions back.<p>I think the idea of 'forced loans' came from the same area as fables of state-planned road running through schools and kindergartens (but not through villas of state officials). It is so heavily mixed up with ideological propaganda and clichés, that it does not really deserve a serious discussion.",1248989677

It wasn't really until Windows 95 came out that the stability of macs started to fall behind.  Windows continued to close the gap on usabilitiy and ease of upkeep, but I'd argue that apple started opening their lead again once OS X was desktop ready.<p>There are a lot of reasons for Apple's failures in the 90s.

Coming from San Francisco, one can see a million reasons why so many bands (and artists) move from SF/Oakland to here. A million more houses with basements, let alone dwellings that don't share two sides with others. (in SF, even practice spaces are hard to get, even when you're able to afford one).<p>And of course the cost of living is better than SF, so theoretically artists can spend more time on their art.<p>But then you notice a lot more ""community"" resources in Portland, too, like the IPRC for zinesters. (free/very low cost access to old-school letterpress, Macs w/layout apps).<p>And MANY small venues for bands to play/artists to have shows, including many all ages venues, sometimes co-ops, sometimes regular business, sometimes house shows (but houses that have ""real"" names, and a decent setup, and show schedule) (high turnover, but these places are always starting up).<p>The venues are a really important building block for artists. Sometimes they're coffee shops with 20 feet of wall space for photos, sometimes they're spacious warehouses for orchestra bands.<p>But they are not just a satellite for OTHER artists, these spaces are somebody's dream in their own right. I now see restaurants and cafes in Portland as their own kind of awesome art/startup business that I've never seen anywhere else.<p>A dungeon-like donut shop? Vegan convenience store (they don't even try to be healthy :D), An all food-cart food court?<p>For whatever reason, people try crazy business/art ideas all the time in Portland, probably because failure isn't that terrifying financially.<p>But it's not just the ""low cost"" that I give credit to in Portland, but the symbiotic nature of businesses and projects.  It's probably fragile, but all these disparate pieces are critical parts of other peoples projects.  It's not mere generosity or community spirit, but just the nature of the ecosystem that gets created when you have enough people with a sincere passion in different parts of a common theme.<p>Some of the traditional building blocks of tech startups are missing in Portland (VC, multiple universities with business friendly tech research), but I think one reason that Portland geeks are unphased by this is that we're so grounded in some of the DIY principles of punk (there, i said it), that resourcefulness/open source/small scale scrappiness are just ""business words"" for values we've already internalized.",1248987999

It perform great.  One of the best sources to deliver video and complex interactivity such as games available.<p>People always attribute the low barrier to entry of flash (7you can crank out a bad website or animation quickly) to the speed and quality of the flashplayer or actionscript/mxml.

An online dating site should be like Google:  give me a bunch of options, and I'll make a quick low-bandwidth decision whether to invest in a face-to-face encounter.  Engaging in an email conversation with someone isn't going to result in a better decision than making a snap judgment based on their picture and profile.  I think it's more likely to result in a <i>worse</i> decision, actually.  When I meet a potential date online, I just want to get face-to-face over drinks (coffee or alcohol) as quickly as possible so I can decide whether to have a real date with her.<p>For me, the only role of the initial contact is to say, ""I would like to meet you.  Would you like to meet me?""  Of course, you also have to communicate that you're human and that you've actually read her profile, and you have to avoid communicating any desperation, narcissism, or other creepiness.  So it's good to keep it short and make a little bit of conversation about something in her profile just to prove you read it.",1252018379

The problem you're talking about had occurred to me too, actually, since markets vary widely in climate. Market it in Alaska and people never, not even in the summer, get used to light clothing for long enough to prefer blankets over heavy clothes when on the couch anyway. Market it in Florida and it never gets cold enough to use a blanket. You'd have to control for climate and culture, which across the US would be challenging (to say nothing of the world).<p>There are ways to do this in the same market though. Something like Vibram FiveFingers is viral enough that you could probably seed like five Vibram wearers in a single market and have each of them refer to the product under a different name. Then track your incoming search queries or orders and match them by market. If more people order ""FiveFingers"" than ""Toe Shoes"" than ""Foot Gloves"" you have yourself a product name.<p>Well, until someone clever on the internet exposes you.

Say, I wanted to watch some ""piano jazz"" music on YouTube, but simply searching by these keywords only gives me videos that have them in their title - which is really wrong. Because Oscar Peterson would definitely match, but most of his videos wouldn't be found like that. Tags would partially solve the issue, but hey: I never noticed it before - I can't see any tags on YouTube, where are they? (probably there are tags there, but I couldn't find them). Also, I would probably want to be subscribed to the channel I like, but what channels are on YouTube? It's basically a single user's video blog. Wouldn't it be nice to have a multiuser blog dedicated to ""piano jazz""?<p>So here's a 3 steps idea:<p>1. Implement a search for channels on YouTube, indexing their descriptions.\n2. Implement tags for YouTube and search for them.\n3. Create a multiuser blog platform for videos from YouTube (and, of course, search in those blogs as well).<p>Since the idea is about 1 hour old I don't know how one can make money on it.

The ""College Algebra"" [1] covers what high-school curriculum covered in either sophomore or junior year (depending on whether they were in the ""AP track""). Claiming that ""learning to graph linear, quadratic, absolute value, and piecewise-defined functions, and solve and graph exponential and logarithmic equations"" is ""college math"" is plain false.<p>So not only are the classes ""low-level"" (because, at least in my Math courses, we didn't get very far before high-bandwidth back-and-forth interaction with the professor becomes essential to the process), but it <i>completely misses the point of college for most people who attend it</i>. No online course could have replaced the socratic questioning my PolySci professor gave us (he told us he modeled the teaching after his professor who would use it to make students cry, but toned it down a bit), or the vigorous debate with a Elizabethan poetry professor about whether the themes in Shakespeare were comprable to modern soap operas, or the engagement in political and academic groups.<p>Sure, it might replace crappy community colleges or degrees for middle aged people seeking to improve their career, but it won't do much for the 17 year olds who are looking to form an identity and foothold in the world.<p>(OTOH, the undergrad CS program at Rutgers could mostly have been replaced with online or self-study. I think that's because the undergrad CS program is so pressured into training tech workers that they can't be nearly as selective as the Math dept).<p>1. <a href=""http://www.straighterline.com/courses/descriptions/algebra/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straighterline.com/courses/descriptions/algebra/</a>",1252016150

The recommendation for short messages is intended to maximize replies per unit time not the reply of any given message.<p>I don't think there is a problem with either approach.  Each strategy probably appeals to a different type of recipient.  So the chosen strategy can be thought to partition the potential recipients into the different types.  (If you send 'A' a long message and A replies A is of the type who likes long messages.  'A' very well might ignore all short messages.  B might have the exact opposite preferences of A.)<p>At this level of abstraction there's not a wrong answer to the question.  By that I mean that the details and content of a message whether long or short are probably more important than the length for any given case.  But if you're someone who prefers to act in an open, earnest manner it's probably best to go with that and partition out people who are mistrustful, cynical or otherwise turned-off by open, earnest action and communication styles.

Time is, as you say, doled out at a constant rate.<p>The highest ROI possible for an estimate is to prevent wasteful effort from proceeding.<p>Timeboxed systems still perform estimation, you just hold different variables constant. In flow-based systems you can perform estimates by taking an integral of the current output.<p>My point is that estimation is <i>always</i> present, even when we go out of our way to say that it isn&#x27;t. They lie on a continuum from gut feel to supercomputers and conference papers. Estimates are always present because humans must always reason under conditions of uncertainty; the future is strictly unknowable.<p>Part of the confusion here is that I think there are two or three definitions of estimate in this thread. I am talking both about the universal case and the methodical estimate-with-an-E case. The universal case is that all decisions leading to action or inaction involve estimation. The methodical case is that estimation for software development is possible and tractable outside of genuine research.",1379462131

My slight reservation here is that I haven&#x27;t seen any published results on combinations of key stretchers (there are several for the other primitives).<p>As for public key stacking, it depends on the application.

For a more obvious comparison: yes, I could sit around constructing object pools in my Java program to avoid heap allocations and their associated garbage collection penalty, but if rudimentary escape analysis manages to pick up a lot of the value, even if &quot;fragile&quot; or nondeterministic, I might not need to spend the time anymore to worry about that kind of detail in my software as the cost benefit analysis shows that the toolchain is now a more efficient usage of resources towards that issue (I could be spending my energy working on algorithm design, for example, instead of object pools). As long as the semantics of the language support the optimization, and as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be difficult to implement, it would be useful to have the compiler perform this optimization for the developer, and one would expect such an optimization to either already be there or be &quot;in the works&quot;.",1379461207

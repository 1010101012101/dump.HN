The vast majority of corporate/commercial software does two things: it gets input from somewhere, either a user or another program, and writes it to a database. It gets records from the database and formats a report for a user or sends it to another program. And that's it. That's all most websites do too. If it's XML then the programmer doesn't even need to know parsing. You can - and many people do - work in software and be good at your job, without <i>any</i> theoretical underpinnings at all.<p>That's not to say that that's a good thing, mind, it's neither good nor bad, but it's a fact that maybe 1 in 10 people employed in the software industry will need to know big-O, perhaps even less than that.",1228948311

Sorry, when it comes to family - real family, not pretend family - you're stuck with them, and you don't just discard them because of ""tough financial conditions"".  Heck, family run companies are full of examples of people who were actively harmful, and were kept on because they were actually family, not ""family"". Now, that may not be the best idea, but it's part of what <i>family</i> means to people where the word has some actual value attached to it.  Sometimes the fake gets layered on too thick in the US.  There are plenty of nice things you can say about a company without resorting to cheeseball shit about being a ""family"".",1228947021

These IPCC papers are huge collections of commentary with footnotes, not actual research.<p>> that the reports are hard to understand<p>The reports are not hard to understand at <i>face value</i>.  They are hard to meaningfully understand.  A statement of cash flows for most corporations can be basically explained in ten minutes.  It doesn't mean anything without analysis, however.  You need industry context and commentary along with it.  If you just read a company's annual report and look at the page with the statement of cash flows on it you're not going to know shit.  These IPCC papers are VERY MUCH like glossy annual public company reports, even aesthetically.  They are nothing like the writing that leads to real understanding of economics or the finances of individual companies.<p>BTW: Why would anyone take an organization with ""intergovernmental"" in its name seriously?  Treating government releases as your first source in any other field is a pretty surefire way to fail.",1228946943

I think given time it will become more acceptable as Twitter ages and more services spring up that people want to use and need funding to survive.<p>I don't think Freemium will work for you, this isn't a necessary service and that's what is required for user conversion from Free to Premium.<p>The webpage login may work, but now you're just giving the user a specific action which means any ads you show them have a very low chance of catching their eye.<p>I think my suggestion is check out Magpie or something similar, and make one ""broadcast"" tweet rather than a DM to each user.

393544,comment,393462,393477,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"There are in fact a couple good ways to do some ""white hat"" SEO:<p>1. Title your pages appropriately - if you want to get  searches for ""Yosemite Park Map"" - then make sure that's the title of the page.<p>2. Make sure your pages are linked - Google will not crawl your pages if they are not linked. I linked all my park maps as follows (<a href=""http://www.trailbehind.com/park_index/0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trailbehind.com/park_index/0/</a>), strictly so Google would crawl them.<p>3. Try and get some external links, through sites such as Y-Combinator and Reddit - external links help your pagerank.<p>4. As a corrolary to #3, you should try and get links where the linked text is the search result you want. So if you want to get referrals for ""Download Park Maps"", you'd like the link to use those exact words.<p>5. Consider your copy carefully, and use key-words for which you want search referrals. If you have a page that is titled ""Yosemite Park Map"" and the words ""Yosemite Park Map"" in the body of the page, that will help.<p>6. Links from credible sites help your page-rank a great deal, so if you know someone with a popular website, ask them to throw you a bone if a link to you is topical to their site.<p>7. Aim at ""long tail"" searches. For my start-up, it's unlikely that we can get links for something like ""Yosemite National Park,"" because there are a lot of great sites that provide information on Yosemite. But there are also a lot of smaller parks, places, and trails which don't have much, and we are looking for Google searches on those.",1228946744

I feel it should be scaled back to 20% due to the amount of marketing and press expenses people (read: indie developers) must now incur. I have no problem engaging in marketing activities, it's just expensive.<p>Also, I just had a huge argument with Apple in which they did not budge to correct a massive bug that has ultimately affected our sales:<p>- app was approved but would not go on sale till our bank contracts were approved. (+2 extra weeks)<p>- once contracts were approved, app was listed as being 2 weeks old, rather than showing a release date that was true to it's availability on the store. it's first day on the store, it was listed near the end of page 1.<p>- within a week, our app is now on the 2nd page. not normal for this section. should have had ~3 weeks of Page 1 exposure.<p>- customer's impression of the app is now distorted, they think it's 3 weeks old with only a few comments and possible not worth the download... as oppose to a brand new app that's accurately dated.<p>For 4 months I've bootstrapped this company and our first (premium) app has now had it's sales potential chopped at the knees. Here's where I get real mad:<p>I talked with multiple representatives about this glaring problem with no luck. Nobody will fix the date. I'm sick of their lack of transparency and unclear requirements around their publishing system. I've sent in screenshots and plenty of proof where their system has failed, and they are in complete denial.

The alternative isn't even ""mankind is adversely affecting the environment"" or not, since it's pretty obvious some things are being hurt. It's ""what shall we spend our money on?"", and if Global Warming is being grossly oversold, let's put that money into things that will actually matter, like fixing the Pacific dead zone or researching the amelioration of other <i>real</i> problems.<p>If Global Warming hysteria is wrong, than panicking and destroying our economies over it is not noble. It is not even neutral. It is destructive, because of the resources that could have been spent solving real problems that got wasted instead. If Global Warming is hysteria and not fact, the hysteria itself is the single greatest threat facing the environment today.<p>Skeptics like myself are often painted as anti-environmental; frankly, I return the change with gusto back to those who won't even consider the question of how to <i>best</i> spend our resources, but assume (with varying and often low degrees of justification) that they already know the answer. <i>First</i> we find the truth, <i>then</i> we figure out the solutions. I think the order has been inverted and that's bad engineering no matter how you slice it.

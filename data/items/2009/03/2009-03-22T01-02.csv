I realized that the people are very very protective about Google. 70% without any particular reason hated the idea of any kind of Google redesign. Even do my arguments were stable  ""The Grid can hold much more information, more photos and videos and can contribute for better visible experience"" almost nobody bother to discus with real arguments.

Sure, some people do it; but if you want someone good, you're much better off asking your friends and colleagues to recommend someone -- because the people you'll find in the Yellow Pages are predominantly those who don't get enough business from customer referrals to fill their hours.",1237685756

526847,comment,526458,526458,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well I suppose the bigger question is, does everything the technology created go away too?<p>Technology built everything, but do all our houses disappear or just all the wiring and plumbing and crap? Because if the house goes, then surely so should all the people who were brought about by technology.<p>Realistically there would be approximately (assuming the max for 10,000 years ago) about 10 million people on the planet. If so, with the distribution spread throughout the world then I think if humanity were born with our present knowledge I think we would do rather well, presuming we were swapped out with the Cro-Magnon. I bet about 50% of the people would probably die off within the first decade just through lack of knowledge (again presuming even IQ and knowledge distribution), but if people managed to start bringing back technology I think we could advance things pretty quick.<p>I mean one person with the knowledge of how to make steel and devoted their life to teaching everyone how to make advanced tools, well we'd have skipped 9,800 years in the space of maybe 50.<p>So I suppose it's all in how it would happen and then a large handful of random chance and human nature. I mean if the one guy who remembered how to build a blast forge, also knew how to make gun powder (I know the principle on how to build both) decided to instead of helping the world decided to build a machine gun and build his own country then it could all end when someone usurped him without the knowledge to build tools or weapons.",1237684445

526845,comment,526694,526694,0,0,owkaye,,,"Since you have the money why don't you just hire someone to do the programming work for you?  Then you'll own 100% of the business, you'll be giving an unemployed programmer a job, and you'll never have to deal with the issues that come up between co-founders when they see things differently.<p>Personally I think the only reason for a co-founder is if you don't have the money to hire someone to do the work you cannot or will not do yourself.  Or if you're such a lazy person or so unfocused that you cannot just get the work done yourself without someone else pushing you all the time ... although if this description applies to you then I would suggest that you're not cut-out to be anything other than an employee anyways.<p>I've been self-employed for almost three decades and I have never missed having a co-founder for anything I've ever done.  But I'm highly self-motivated and seldom second-guess my decisions, and with so many years in business I have more than my share of experience doing all kinds of different work -- including programming.  So maybe this is why I never missed having a co-founder.<p>I guess if you want to get funding from Y you'll need a co-founder since PG apparently doesn't fund companies without one -- not many of them anyways.  But since you said you don't need the money I cannot for the life of me figure out why you would even want a co-founder ...<p>Do you really think it's an intelligent move to give away a huge chunk of your future business simply to find a competent programmer???<p>Regardless of your answer, I think you should hire a programmer instead of trying to partner with one (unless you really don't have as much money as you suggest) ... and there are lots of places to find programmers other than the Bay Area.<p>I also think you're going to have to get over your fear of someone stealing your idea, and start explaining it in more detail, before you'll find the person or people who will do the programming that makes it a reality.  I'm willing to bet that you're not even the first to think of your idea.   You might even be surprised when you explain it to learn that other people here already know of similar services, either currently in existence or in the process of being developed.",1237684424

Wikipedia's challenges could be solved by a trust matrix.<p>If users were given trust values (think eBay feedback, but a bit smarter) and then users could in turn rate articles, that would at least partially solve some of Wikipedia's biggest criticisms (the content is unchecked and liable to spam / abuse).<p>Trust networks like that scale exponentially with the number of nodes (users and articles) so I suppose it would significantly increase the resources required to host something like Wikipedia.

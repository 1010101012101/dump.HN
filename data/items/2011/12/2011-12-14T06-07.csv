I've always had a sizable stash of equipment that I'd play with, learn about, and eventually use to run services.  As I've grown older, the initial purchase price has become less important, and the storage cost has become more important;  my current workshop/office is maybe 200-300sqft, and it's got two people and a lot of hardware in it.<p>The thing is, here the cost is time, not storage space; and I think people learn the 'time is valuable' lesson sooner.   But yeah, you would be keeping out 12 year old me, which is fine.  Personally, I would think that the majority of people at these events would be past that point.  dono.<p>You'd certainly need to apply another level of filtering; obviously you don't want to listen to a pitch from every joker with fifty bucks, the question then would be how much easier would that filtering process be if you first filter out all the 12 year old lsc types for whom the fifty bucks is a big opportunity cost.

As far as I can tell Go is entirely about getting rid of unnecessary cruft and boilerplate and making a practical language you won't hate working in. Inasmuch as most interpreted languages are intended to be practical languages you won't hate working in, they are similar to Go.<p>As far as the actual type system, the reason they feel similar is probably because interpreted languages tend to be duck-typed, and so is Go. When you code in an interpreted languages you expect arguments to functions to be of a certain type, where type just means ""responds appropriately to methods I call on it"". In Go, interfaces are just method specifications and any type that has appropriate methods satisfies the interface. For example, you might have an argument ""input"" of type ""io.Reader""[1] to a function. All this really means is that you expect to be able to call ""input.Read()"" to populate a byte slice. As a result the implicit type guarantees you expect from an interpreted language and the explicit type guarantees you get from Go are basically the same.<p>[1] <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader</a>",1323844280

In fact, on my last laptop, this is exactly what happened: the audio system under Windows did not support one of the headphone jacks (there were two for some odd and unknown reason). From a tinkerer's point of view, Linux even has an advantage here: if there is some way to improve the situation, it's much easier to find under Linux. I have literally spent <i>days</i> searching for 64bit drivers for an external wireless network adapter on Windows; finding the same for Linux was trivial.<p>And to me, of course, the most important bit is that once I get everything working--it's gotten easier with each new computer :)--Linux provides by far the best experience.<p>How are the Dells that come with Ubuntu, coincidentally? I haven't seen them in retail anywhere, but I have seen them for sale online. If the support there is good, it could be a nice stepping stone going forward.",1323843598

It is usually something like a cop hiding on a side street at the top of Portola late at night waiting for someone to run a red light, which is financially worth a lot more to the city (~$500). The reality is that a cell phone violation is not worth much financially to the city ($20-$50) and drivers ignore the law since it is pretty much just a slap on the wrist. [1]<p>So, instead of banning the use outright, which a lot of people will object to because nobody likes to be told they can't do something (ignoring the whole driving is a right motto). I'd just say, increase the fines to the level of a red light run and increase the enforcement.

3350879,comment,3348671,3350666,16,0,brettvallis,,,"I don't usually talk about this, but your post speaks to something that most opinions on the subject never do.<p>22 years ago I went through a fairly strange time: I was depressed, disconnected, and feeling deeply alone. It culminated in a very violent suicide attempt. Despite all my plans and precautions I was found still alive and hospitalised. Being young and antisocial I never went back to therapy and for a few months afterwards I kept going back to the idea of trying it again.<p>The turning point for me was realising that suicide was in fact an option. Admittedly a pretty drastic option, but one nonetheless. Neither was it 'the easy way out', or 'for the weak'. Destroying one's own life isn't a spur of the moment decision, similar to deciding which tart one should have for tea, etc. Driven by desperation, or severe pain, it is a momentous decision and the consequences are irreversible - no one who really makes the decision does so lightly.<p>The understanding that it was an option, gave me a feeling of control. Since it was an option and one that I could take at any time, I had some level of control over my situation. If that was an option, then perhaps there were other options. I decided to explore other options. I haven't been there in 18 years but I still know what it feels like.<p>We are adults. At your worst times, don't be intimidated by ignorant misconceptions about suicide. It is your mind, you have the right to explore it, and you have the right to make whatever decision you feel is correct for you. Just remember that if there is one way of resolving an issue there may just be another way, one that is less violent, less irreversible; one that may just provide further options, one that may eventually lead to happiness, however remote that may appear at the moment.",1323843193

1634826,comment,1631975,1632567,0,0,duairc,,,"There is certainly an argument to be made that ""feminism"" is not the best name for itself, but regardless, that is its name and it certainly is true that that is what feminism is. It is not about trying to get more rights for womyn while ignoring the areas of society where men are oppressed. That's total nonsense and completely ignoring the real problem. But that's not what feminism is. Feminism exists to challenge and ultimately destroy the mental programming we've been subjected to that causes us to assign specific roles and rights to people based on what we perceive their gender to be in the first place. This idea of gender is something that oppresses all of us, male, female or whatever, and feminism is a movement to destroy it. Seriously, that really is what it's about, regardless of the impressions you might get from the name.",1282787962

Sure that can help you attract good developers to come work for you - but if you launch too many OSS project the overhead costs can become disproportionate to the funding of the company.<p>You also need to be careful that while you are building value early-on that you are not exposing yourself for your competitors (or your own employees) to fork what you are doing and build their own competitive service (it does happen but again, some of this comes down to license used).<p>I would not want to publish 'secret sauce' of a company (algorithms, development strategies, etc) before I got to a point where I could defend the business with network effect, traction, funding, etc.<p>There is no point of over-committing or over-exposing and then not having the resources to be around in 18 months time to keep the OSS project going.",1282787943

See IBM's developerworks as examples as to how the largest organizations can participate in the open source community and not try to take direct control.<p>Now, IBM's motive is to most likely bundle services around those OSS implementations, so they profit from that.<p>On the other hand, we have Oracle who outright acquires OSS organizations just to wrap sales and maintenance around the products.  They'll trickle in funding to barely nurture the products along, only to have the founders/leaders of those projects bail when they realize what is really happening.<p>That results in the mass resignations that we see with MySQL and countless other Sun OSS acquisitions.<p>And don't get me started on Java. :(",1282787884

Maybe it's possible to make a well-designed SUV, but mine is just awful. Latest example: the gas cap doesn't screw on and off like an ordinary fucking gas cap, it's a turn-1/8-of-a-turn-and-pull-out gas cap, <i>with a lock</i>. So, with all those moving parts, it broke and I had to spend like $80 getting a shop to forcibly remove the thing and replace it with another gas cap (non-locking, so it's more reliable). This is when it got permanently jammed--when it was only temporarily jammed, the only way to put gas in the damned tank was to rear back and kick it in the gas cap, which allows you to unlock and remove the gas cap in the usual fashion. This little fix permanently bent my fuel door out of position.<p>And newer SUV's are even worse. You can't even see out of the back of a fucking 08 Explorer.",1282787587

1634811,comment,1634443,1634537,0,0,alsomike,,,"Interesting background, I didn't realize Creative Lab worked on that campaign. It's certainly an improvement on Google's usual branding efforts and I totally agree that that's a better direction, but I think it still misses the mark in some ways. They want to pull on your heart strings, and yet the whole time you are stuck staring at a browser window. If the message was supposed to be human-centered rather than the Droid-style technology-centered, like ""Your life is what's important, Google can help you"", why did they stick the technology in your face for 100% of the time? Instead of showing the human side, it's almost like they unintentionally made an ad about fear of technology: you spend all your time staring at a screen missing real life. Who knows, maybe this is Creative Labs opinion of Google's culture.<p>This is unlike Apple's FaceTime ads, which also play on the same emotions, but that ad succeeds because it's set inside the human world. Facebook tried something similar with Places (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfX_ZQag1BM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfX_ZQag1BM</a>), trying to connect the technology with very strong emotions, nostalgia, etc. They did show a lot of real life scenes, but I think it also failed. They're selling the idea that Places helps you have serendipitous meetings with your ""facebook friends"", i.e. casual acquaintances you generally don't share those kinds of strong emotions with. It's completely incongruous for Facebook to try to brand itself around what are fairly private emotions that you usually reserve for only your most intimate relationships, especially after basically forcing everyone into public mode and declaring privacy dead.",1282787470

Let's try #4:<p>This thing bugs me in a greater sense than simply the issues or people involved, and here's why: <i>you're paying this guy to petition his students to pay him more</i>. Strip away all the (real) problems and politics and all of that, and you end up with some guy you write a check to who is doing his best to a) call you a slovenly idiot, b) get you to spend more on him and his projects, and c) use his position as educator to influence his students to advance his causes.<p>He may be exactly correct. I don't think he is, but whether he is correct or not doesn't matter. Even if he is 100% accurate in everything he says, it's a conflict of interest. We simply can't have people on the public dole who also are political activists -- even in their spare time. I wish there was some way around this quandary -- the military has higher standards but we still see them getting dragged into various political fights. We have scientists who are activists, teachers who are promoting dissent, and public sector unions who are playing politics with public funds.<p>Again, it's not that I disagree with their politics or efforts. It's that we cannot self-stimulate. The money that comes from taxpayers cannot be caught into a feedback loop to promote even more money coming from taxpayers. The people we entrust with various public functions cannot also be using the stature we give them to score political points.<p>The only exceptions to this are political appointees, whose sole purpose is to play politics and be party hacks. For the rest of them, I am concerned that this is a really bad thing that is only getting worse and worse over time. I really hope some of these professional organizations can come up with appropriate ethical standards. It's like I read the other day: it used to be that scientists told you what ""is"". Now they tell you what we need ""to do"". (It was accompanied by an interesting graph from Lexis-Nexis with the frequency of the words ""science says we must"" which is rising exponentially in popular media.)<p>Aside from the specific politics in this case, the trend here is not good at all.",1282785617

You probably don't have a civil trespass claim, either. Civil trespass is intentionally entering the property of another without justification to do so. The court just affirmed that placing GPS on a car is legal justification to enter the property. So you would lose on the trespass claim.<p>Of course that assumes it even sees the light of day in court. Civil claims take years to litigate and seeing that no actual monetary damage was done to the car the plaintiff is only entitled to nominal damages, perhaps $25 if he is lucky. Contrast that with thousands of dollars and many hours to litigate and this case is clearly a money losing proposition.<p>I am not saying I agree with it.

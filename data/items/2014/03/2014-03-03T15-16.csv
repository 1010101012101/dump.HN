7334404,comment,7333998,7333998,23,0,tokenadult,,,"I see the article title (which I put on the submission, and one comment commented on) was replaced by an HN moderator with a rewording of the article subtitle. I guess that&#x27;s okay.<p>The article was especially eye-catching for me, because it was first posted among our mutual Facebook friends by my mentor in homeschooling mathematics, the mother of the first United States woman to win a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad. The teacher featured in the article as the developer of innovative teaching methods for young learners is also a Facebook friend of mine, and we are part of a network of parents and teachers who are curious about how to stimulate interest in mathematics among young learners by doing things differently from the United States typical school curriculum in mathematics. I&#x27;m grateful that my children have been exposed to approaches like that (which I follow imperfectly in my homeschooling my children and in teaching other learners in classroom courses for my occupation), as that has helped my oldest son launch into the adult world with good problem-solving skills for hacking at the startup where he works.<p>There is a continual tension in mathematics education between teaching topics in their logical order as we understand mathematical topics in light of modern higher mathematics and teaching topics in their historical order of development (which is largely what happens in school mathematics courses). Children need some concrete, tangible experience with counting and with shapes to understand much about mathematics. The cool abstractions that motivate higher mathematics may be inaccessible to children who have no experience with tangible examples of those absractions. (See<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/opinion/commentary/la-oe-adv-frenkel-why-study-math-20140302,0,5177338.story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/commentary/la-oe-adv-frenkel-...</a><p>an article submitted to Hacker News yesterday, for more about this.) But it looks like we can gain in mathematics instruction by letting children play with more sophisticated representations of mathematics than most children get to play with. Games are great learning tools. One of favorite games for teaching mathematics I learned about from John Holt&#x27;s book <i>How Children Fail</i> (originally published 1964, which I read in 1971 on the advice of my school&#x27;s assistant principal). The twenty questions game asks children to find a number from 1 to 1,000,000 by asking twenty yes/no questions, which the person who chose the unknown number must answer truthfully. It is an interesting mathematical exercise to show that twenty questions is (barely) enough for finding one number in one million if the twenty questions are used optimally. I have played this game many times with the children in my classes, and the opportunity to play this game again at the end of class is one of my strongest incentives for the children to stay focused during a lesson on a Saturday morning to get through the lesson content efficiently.<p>Playing with challenging problems appears to be the royal road for learning mathematics.<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php</a><p>I hope ideas like this spread through many communities in the United States and the English-speaking world, so that more young people gain more opportunity to learn to enjoy challenging mathematics early and often.",1393862242

A recent post on HN by an expert elaborated on why transaction malleability wasn&#x27;t likely to have been the source of this exploit [1]. Meanwhile Mt.

Gox&#x27;s legal representation, in a sort of &quot;that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it&quot; sort of way.

First of all, HIV/AIDS (or even STDs more generally) is hardly the only medical concern people want kept private. The privacy and security provisions were designed to negate foreseen resistance to the administrative simplification provisions (incentives to adopt electronic transactions, national standards for form and content of electronic transactions, etc.) and thereby <i>improve</i> information sharing. (And just about every subsequent enhancement of the privacy and security provisions in the law has been tied to a new set of administrative simplification provision that extends new incentives to electronic transactions and records, extends the scope of mandatory standards for electronic transactions, etc.)<p>> My instinct is that HIPAA has cost many lives by locking up data that could be used to help doctors be better doctors. If my kids were allergic to bee stings, I wish this information would show up as the first result of a Google search.<p>One of the big motivations for HIPAA and its subsequent enhancements in terms of standardized health records and transactions is, to the extent this is relevant to doctors being doctors, making this the case.<p>Except not with &quot;Google&quot; or other systems publicly accessible for non-medical purposes that lack detailed accountability to you for who has used it and for what purpose.",1393862144

But we are not there yet. So should one leave for another place, and find that culture (work for a startup?), or work with it, as in just pretend you work harder to get noticed better...<p>So I am not defending the idea behind it, but your rationale for working with it.<p>Think about this scenario. It is 8:30pm, manager/owner walks by and he sees group of developers huddled over a monitor screen. What is happening? Is this a good thing or not? Are they working extra hard and deserve +$5k bonus at the end of the year, or they picked a bad technology, made bad mistakes in the implementation, allowed untested code in production and now have to put out fires. I think the opinion on the above will be pretty divided, but, unfortunately, it will mostly be seen a good thing.  This spreads and becomes part of the culture, and those that are productive and finish their work faster, whose code doesn&#x27;t break in production leave at 5, and are seen as lazy by incompetent managers. That is very dangerous.<p>The worst I have seen is people what seems like to me, intentionally allow bugs in production, things crash and burn. Then, they get to save the day with lots fanfare and visibility. That becomes a very dysfunctional environment from which one should try to escape as soon as possible.",1393861350

7334300,comment,7333609,7333609,2,0,triangleman83,,,"Lunch is quite a variable thing in the US workplace.  I&#x27;ve had all sorts:<p>1: Got takeout lunch and came back to eat it at my desk.  Would get griped at by boss for eating at desk because it seems like I am available to work (between 12pm-1pm hours?). I was told to &quot;eat somewhere out&quot; except the only place to get internet was at my desk.  Maybe I should have had a neon sign to indicate it was my lunch hour.  This was ~2003 so I guess my only option for killing an hour out at a restaurant at the time would have been some kind of portable gaming system.<p>2: Work provided lunch, some people ate in the break room, I brought back to desk, worked while eating (not much work to be done in 10 minutes really), then left to go home for ~45 minutes to play on computer there.  Free lunch and still an appreciable break!<p>3: Since I drove 75 miles one way to work, I came in an hour later and ate lunch at desk.  I can admit I was less productive during this time.  Not to mention, I did have to drive out for lunch which cost ~10-15 minutes.  Oversight was low, however, and I felt owed a bit by the huge delays on the promised opening of a new office nearby my house.<p>4: Lunch hour is mandatory between 12pm-1pm.  Made lunch in break room, ate at desk to play on computer for my mandatory 1 hour. I had to start wearing headphones because bosses (same bosses who made mandatory lunch) would try to talk work during 12pm-1pm hours since they never ate lunch or went anywhere for lunch.  I wish they had stuck to their own rule.  Eventually started going to Chinese restaurant nearby for the hour to escape, made friends with order taker there, watched tv shows on iPad or read books on e-reader.  You could say I did learn my lesson from #1 here and the advent of portable tech kept me satisfied.  Was less happy when lunch was reduced to 1/2 hour since it made my Chinese trip impossible.  Had to stick to faster food and eat in my truck, with tethered iPad or e-reader of course.<p>5: Currently, my office is 5 minutes from my house as is my wife&#x27;s, so we meet up at home.  My lunch hour is flexible whereas hers is not, so I wait for a text that she is leaving first.<p>In conclusion, lunch time usage greatly depends on what the employer will allow. However attempting to eat at my desk has either upset my employer by making it seem like I am available to work when I am taking an hour break, or else it probably was not productive time which my employer was probably not aware of but still wouldn&#x27;t have been thrilled about.",1393861324

You become positioned as the niche guys who know everything about Z. That could be a very sustainable business or eventually lead to a nice profitable acquisition by a bigger player.<p>Another possibility is that the talk of owning the technology and cutting you off and shutting you down is bravado talk and only one possible scenario from within Big Corp.  Someone higher up might decide that this is not strategic and just walk away from it even after making a bunch of noise and plans.  Happens all the time. Or, upon further analysis they might decide that you have already taken development risk out of the equation by the good progress you have made. And, that it makes much more sense to just see if they can acquire your team and IP than to run through the same cycle of development risk and potentially turn out a product that is both worse and late to market.<p>I guess in the end, I lean toward making some comments that let them know that there is a possibility of working out an acquisition or licensing deal. If at that point, Big Corp seems determined to just redevelop it themselves and cut you out, then I would approach the competitors. Just realize that Big Corp may respond positively about acquisition and then just keep stringing you along, all the while doing their own thing.<p>Tough calls to make",1393859796

The salient difference in thought is that the goal is rarely to be right (initially), but to get insight about mathematical stuff.<p>Mathematicians do (and students should) focus on proofs over computations, and there is an extreme amount of subjectivity there. If you produce a false proof, it can nevertheless be beautiful and yield fantastic insights. Likewise, a correct proof can be unsatisfying and ugly. Your goal then is to revise it (or completely rewrite it) to make it more beautiful and insightful.<p>Here is an example: the 7 Bridges of Konigsberg problem is one of the most famous (solved) problems in all of mathematics. One can easily give a proof by exhaustion, but that is wholly unsatisfying and perhaps the ugliest possible proof. A much better proof involves some insight into graph theory, and a satisfying and elegant proof would give you a characterization of these kinds of trails in graphs.<p>You don&#x27;t need a mechanical background to start trying to solve such puzzles (I know because I&#x27;ve taught it that way), and you don&#x27;t need any mathematical background to appreciate the very elementary proof.

You must do it.<p>When reading an advanced math book for the fist time, I can spend 1 hour per page, because I must copy the proof, try a few &quot;improvements&quot; that are dead ends, do some exercise, and understand what is the main idea of that part.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to mixing some modern subjects without calculation. Most of the time, the idea is to just hide the technical details so now it&#x27;s totally unintelligible and the only possible way to learn it is by memorization. It&#x27;s possible to teach magic and religion in the same way.<p>I like to add some comments about applications in my classes, but they are marked as off topic, and they are short because usually there is no time to spare.<p>Some of the proposed subjects are plausible to teach, for example module arithmetic. I&#x27;d like to see a discussion in school about the module 2, 9 and 10 arithmetic. (2 is almost intuitive, 10 is easy to see, and 9 is the base for the &quot;rule of nines&quot; test, that is usually teached without proof)<p>But, for example, Riemannian geometry is difficult. It&#x27;s possible to pick a sphere surface and show that the geodesic intersects in two points. Explain the sum of the angles in a triangle? And then what? I don&#x27;t have any intuition about hyperbolic geometry. It&#x27;s difficult to students to see what is happening with the geometry in a plane in spite it&#x27;s easy to draw, and we have paper everywhere to tray.<p>> <i>I recently visited students in fourth, fifth and sixth grades at a school in New York to talk about the ideas of modern math, ideas they had never heard of before. [...] I used a Rubik&#x27;s Cube to explain symmetry groups: Every rotation of the cube is a &quot;symmetry,&quot; and these combine into what mathematicians call a group. I saw students&#x27; eyes light up when they realized that when they were solving the puzzle, they were simply discerning the structure of this group.</i><p>It&#x27;s an interesting topic, but the problem is not how much you can explain but how much the students understand. Did he make any test to measure it? Can the students solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube?<p>I&#x27;d like to see a test for this idea. Pick 10 classes and divide them in two groups. Give 5 of them the traditional education and 5 of them the &quot;modern topics&quot; proposal. Pick the classes at random. Pick the teachers at random!!! Don&#x27;t compare one class with a standard underpaid &quot;traditional&quot; teacher with 30 students and a class with a specially selected for the experiment teacher with 10 students. And compare them with multiple choice exercise, not teacher opinion or self report interest.",1393859173

1746639,comment,1742305,1746397,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"I can't edit this post anymore so another random comment: <i>ssh</i> doesn't work with link local addresses. I just set up an ad-hoc wireless network between my two laptops and tried to ssh from one to the other. The addressing works because I can ""broadcast""-ping both networks successfully:<p><pre><code>  psypete@pinhead:~$ ping6 -Iwlan0 ff02::1
  PING ff02::1(ff02::1) from fe80::216:eaff:fe9b:56e2 wlan0: 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from fe80::216:eaff:fe9b:56e2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.055 ms
  64 bytes from fe80::20e:8eff:fe13:5741: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.23 ms (DUP!)
</code></pre>
But unfortunately it seems ssh doesn't know to set its sin6_scope_id for the interface of the bind address I tell it.<p><pre><code>  psypete@pinhead:~$ strace -e trace=network ssh -6 -b fe80::216:eaff:fe9b:56e2 fe80::20e:8eff:fe13:5741 2>&1 | grep AF_INET6
  bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, ""fe80::216:eaff:fe9b:56e2"", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

It doesn't ""fix"" the problem of running out of IPv4 address space (unless a given ISP decides to switch to IPv6-only, require its customers to upgrade, and turn on a multihomed IPv4 address for extreme cases). What it does do is allow the transition to take place. Everyone should be shouting at the top of our lungs at ISPs to support this so we can get this chicken/egg scenario over with.<p>People are basically in denial. The cost is never going to be null and everyone has to move eventually. Server admins actually have the bulk of the responsibility here for getting the whole internet migrated to IPv6. It's their services we want to use and network addresses are just a way of getting to them.<p>The problem is they have seemingly no accountability. I tried to hold the admin of xkcd.com's feet to the fire and I got rebuffed. Unless there's a substantive potential for their customers to abandon them they don't really give a crap (hopefully because they have other things to take care of). And in the meantime they can claim they don't need to move because the rest of the network isn't ready for them yet. So tell ISPs to multihome already and we can then start telling server admins to get their shit together because the rest of the network is ready for them.",1285929738

There's too much play so the device can wobble or not be seated correctly, and this can damage the usb pins.

1746565,comment,1745633,1746192,0,0,mycroftiv,,,"A very nice reply, thank you. I believe though that there is a real problem of code reuse vs. reinventing the wheel in the FOSS community. One of the main rationales of open source is collaboration, but very often, developers choose to begin new projects rather than attempting to collaborate on an existing codebase. Instead of harmonious group effort, we end up with a ""tower of babel"" of competing projects. Choice and variety are good, but they need to be balanced against the principle of trying to produce the maximum amount of value from an investment of time and energy. Sometimes duplication of effort means that no new value is added by re-implementing the same functionality present in other software.",1285927909

I tried it when my site was getting 1000 visitors per day: $1/day.  When I had 4000 visitors per day, $1/day.  10000 visitors/day, $1/day.<p>Granted, it was the same site, with gaps of about a year in between attempts, so likely what I was actually seeing was the downtrend in people across the entire internet clicking google ads.  Back when they were new, you might click them.  Now that people have noticed that every single time they clicked a google ad they ended up on a made-for-adsense site with more google ads, they stopped clicking them.<p>If I were you I wouldn't bother.  Sites without ads just look cleaner and more professional.  For a dollar a day, it's not worth losing that.",1285927770

Only text links are not going to make you money, especially considering a lot of your readers (programmers presumably) are already averse to clicking on ads.<p>If you do want to put up ads, good sponsors might be the way forward. Flowingdata is a good example which puts up high quality relevant ads for its audience and is making a few thousand dollars a month.

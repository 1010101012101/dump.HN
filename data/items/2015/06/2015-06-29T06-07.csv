The core concept of Containers is supposed to be that you write to the unix process model, and the process model alone; Not create new systems from whole cloth in overly abstract ways.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work for a lot of legacy systems, but rather than port or write new systems to do those functions, the Docker model seems to have absorbed all the hacks without documenting any of the best practices, allowing anyone who&#x27;s going about creating new systems to wander off into the weeds of subfeatures and hacks.<p>Unfortunately, the LMCTFY project seems to be dead; They&#x27;re porting features into the already bloated libcontainer, though I&#x27;m certain the borglet it is based on stays fairly pristine. LMCTFY and the google stack are a very different style of systems administration than is currently in vogue; but together they create a beautiful and pristine ecosystem with very few rough edges.<p>Anyway: If you want to know what you should be building with Docker, figure out how you would build it with just what LMCTFY provides. Some of it is non-obvious (Service discovery is a core service that exists in many forms, but few that are analogous/replacements for what the google stack needs), but by paring down what you work with, you ultimately create much tighter, more reliable systems.",1435561180

Arguably Android sans Google apps, over-the-air updates fit into that box.<p>The idea of three nodes, trivially separated and air-gapped is interesting.<p>One should be able to do the input with an adruino or something (most obvious choice, a keyboard, but could also tack on a mic/camera for audio/video).<p>Link that with a &quot;one-way&quot; cable to a rpi2 (the &quot;compromised&quot;/networked node), and a cheap android tablet w/o baseband/gsm chips -- and perhaps solder off the antennas/kill the wlan/bluetooth. Preferably one w/o NFC. Use the tablet as the screen, and the &quot;out&quot; node.<p>Use lobotomized usb-cable for power from the Android-devices battery, and run everything off that.<p>I do like the idea of having the separation be obvious and simple -- easy to audit.<p>Suppose one might as well run freedos on the two nodes -- but Linux/BSD is probably less painful.",1435561139

Perth culture promotes the idea that its citizens are bound by destiny to have a big impact on the world, since its literally a city on the edge of the world, very far from most of the major civilizing actions, and very isolated from most of what is going on.  So it &quot;has to be&quot; a very progressive, &quot;forward-thinking&quot; place.

  - See if there are ways that the work done can be absorbed into another company
  - Drop a note to mentors/ advisors when you are professionally ready
  - Do some small projects for companies in your network who can pay on time, and hopefully also let you slowly ease into a different team and environment
  - Cut down on expenses
  - Plan your project portfolio and resume
  - Try to do at least some light exercise regularly (e.g. 3 times weekly)
  - Try to see how you close the loose ends (tough, but take as much time as you need and take into account your mental state)
  - Don&#x27;t force yourself to go all out socially
  - Write down thoughts about why you think the startup failed, organize it later when you can look at it calmly
  - Don&#x27;t try to over-analyse the situation
  - May want to explore meditation
  - May want to explore religion as a way of thinking about life&#x27;s meaning and putting things in perspective</code></pre>",1435560622

I was a noob by all means when I did my 2nd startup, because my first startup had an early acquisition which I didn&#x27;t really go through a lot of things. So due to that my 2nd time it left me with a lot of bruises of rookie mistakes.<p>It was awful, but I decided take school and help me forget about Startups, business and the sorts of things I was obsessed was before. So this helped because I got to talk to people whom were not necessarily talking startup and business, which diverts your anger/disappointment towards something different.<p>After 3rd startup:(run out of money, quite literally)<p>After my 2nd startup I had enough cash to not get a job, but this time around I had a lot more pressure which left me with no choice, but getting a job. I had some great investors whom knew why I fall into this situation, which helped a lot.<p>Few things I did:<p>1- I put behind everything I was hopping for before, because I knew that I have reached a new low (which is not good).<p>2- Making new hopes!<p>3- I started fresh (joined a tiny startup and worked for them like it was my first ever time programming / building a team).<p>Things learned:<p>1- I wouldn&#x27;t jump into another startup of your own. (don&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t) The pressure becomes too much and productivity tanks.<p>2- Make sure you agree on leaving behind the miseries of a startup to start something new (aka joining a team). It&#x27;s a good time to let go of things when you feel your shoulder is holding too much.<p>3- Your sanity and your life is the most precious thing you have, after my 3rd startup I had death threats and that was the reason I had to let it go. So things like that shows you how cheap life can be in others eyes, while for you, that is the biggest asset you have your control over.<p>So feeling shitty or guilt shouldn&#x27;t stop you from going into something new.<p>Also, if you have enough of experience with programming and building, then you can do some consulting or freelancing very easily.<p>PS: if you&#x27;re in based States don&#x27;t freaking try Elance or Odesk. Because that will just destroy your thoughts more, it&#x27;s like race to the bottom for prices. Try using HN (Who is Hiring) or Reddit /r/forhire or Twitter or friends to get some gig.<p>Ah and one last thing, ego and pride can be hard to get over, but don&#x27;t bury them, because these times will be your medal of honor and soon enough you can feel proud of them.",1435559642

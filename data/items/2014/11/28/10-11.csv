8670488,comment,8669834,8670426,0,0,nickik,,,"Well, Hacker News comments are not a format for this. I cant get all the sources in a short amount of time and doing this for one person in a tech forum is not really worth my time. Also if I just gave you things to read, you will have a bias starting point, I would only provide things that I think are good. So I can only advice that you start from blank and dive into it, see were your research leads you.<p>I can only tell you my story. I had the same opinion as you do now, and because I became intrested in economics I started reading a lot about it and these tech monopoly cases pushed my attention towards these antitrust laws and my research change my mind.<p>And its not even the case that these laws were put in place with good intention and then they were abused, but the other way around they were put in place to be abused.<p>> My point was that you can argue the negatives outweigh the benefits, but &quot;you can choose not to use them&quot; in the context of a monopolies debate isn&#x27;t relevant.<p>The question really is, what is a monopoly. Its suprisingly hard to answer. Is the defintion that there are no real alternatives? Or that they have a market share of X%. Is a company that has a techniclly unique product a monoply because nobody else can produce it. If you think about it, everything is a monoply, nobody else can produce the exact thing you do. So there is a question about granularity of monopoly definition. Some might say &#x27;over one market&#x27; but that is very vage as well. Take the car as a example, does it only compete with other cars of simular size or does it also compet with airplanes and trains? Does a car sometimes play in the same market as skype, because if I can work remotely I dont need a car.<p>In economics, price theory is used, when a company can push the price over some equillibrum price its a monopoly but that of course cant really be used in the case of google or the internet explorer case.<p>Also  &quot;you can choose not to use them&quot; is relevant, because thats the last competition even the biggest monoply provider faces. For everything that is not a live or death question you have the option to not use it. Befor some pruduct/service X was invented you could live without X and now a monopoly provides X, you are not forced to buy X now, you can just go on with your live unchanged. This is very relevant in the economic analysis of markets and monopolys.<p>Im not saying monopolys are not sometimes a problem, im just saying that the issue is far more complicated then it seams.",1417172169

The idea behind them is great and does not have many of the downsides indicated: just get together and work on things that require more &#x27;bandwidth&#x27; than e-mail or IRC or sub-projects where you can quickly progress when tackling it with a couple of other people. Besides that, it&#x27;s a good occasion to meet fellow project members, have a barbecue, and talk all night.<p>However, most hackatons that I see in my mailbox are completely different. They are often:<p>- A way for a company to get some app programmed as quickly and cheaply as possible (you win a price and we get all rights).<p>- A way for companies to recruit.

8670476,comment,8668680,8669187,0,0,lmm,,,"> &quot;Strong typing&quot; is an ambiguous term, I&#x27;m going to need something more specific. As far as I&#x27;m aware, &quot;strong typing&quot; is used as a spectrum, in which case C is relatively strong because the compiler will reject parameters that don&#x27;t match a function signature&#x27;s data type unless explicitly cast.<p>C has some unfortunate integer conversion rules and a style that often encourages the use of (unsafe) void pointers. Perhaps more importantly, the only way to implement polymorphism is with casting or unions, both of which are very much unsafe.<p>Still, you <i>can</i> write safe code in C, at least once you write an object system. Use structs rather than typedefs, avoid casts, use only memory-safe things, write wrapper functions to allow you to do allocation and deallocation in a safe way. It&#x27;s actually possible to reach a similar safety level to something like Haskell - but it will require a lot of tedious hand coding because the language doesn&#x27;t have the abstraction facilities that would let you write these helpers generically. Eventually you end up greenspunning.<p>> Nonetheless, unit tests aren&#x27;t a panacea. If all you do is just run your unit tests, watch them pass and proclaim &quot;Well, everything works! No need to do any acceptance, integration, system, fuzz or other form of testing! Not even gonna run it, let&#x27;s just ship!&quot;, then that&#x27;s quite stupid, to put it mildly.<p>Sure. But I think it&#x27;s reasonable for your day-to-day code loop to be edit / run unit tests, and to do the fancier testing or manual testing maybe a few times a week.<p>In a language like Haskell (actually I use Scala) you can get to the same point with compilation. It won&#x27;t just happen without working at it, you need to think about what invariants are important and then encode them into your types. And you wouldn&#x27;t want to release/deploy without executing the program or running some tests. But you can get to the point where in day-to-day coding an edit/compile cycle is enough.",1417171914

Strange things start happening to people when they are put into an environment where they can&#x27;t do anything but eat, sleep and meditate.

What about selling hardware that focused on the receiving endpoint? The target demographics probably have literacy/language issues with the content, so providing dedicated hardware to read text (instead of broadcasting actual audio, saving bandwidth), translate it, and do text-to-speech could be an example of some additional products to sell. Sell an app version too for middle-wealth countries. Selling infrastructure items doesn&#x27;t create that conflict-of-interest in my mind that paying for content does.<p>Jumping off of the classifieds idea. What if you charged a flat fee, the same flat fee, for every submission regardless of what it was? If submitters truly have altruistic intentions, then this small flat fee is a small hurdle for the little guys, and probably a dead end for the very wealthy to try and overpopulate the system with whatever they want. So that the pressure is not on you to arbitrarily regulate the income sources. Decouple money from content is my main theme here.<p>On content:\nI&#x27;ve never liked one-dimensional voting systems that are simply popularity contests. It&#x27;s not that hard for a organized group to up-vote their propaganda (one group of many) while the altruistic content submitters are all left by the wayside (many groups of one). What I&#x27;d like to see is voting be not for submission, but for classification of content. It could be instructional, news, public service, propaganda, entertainment, etc. Then let your paid submitters be the ones to vote separately on ratios of these categories of content that finally get broadcasted. And only content that has been reviewed and voted for past a certain threshold gets proposed for submission. Right now, looking at the stream, I am already biased AGAINST stuff that is paid. Disclosure of that fact is great obviously, but what if a private org really is producing great content? I&#x27;ll probably never check it out. A community filtering/classification of the content would put my mind at ease as the same standards of review would apply for paid and free content.",1417170980

With a system like this, you specify a target position relative to the current position, the sponginess of the spring, and the speed of which it oscillates.

When I found a suitable design, I&#x27;d rewrite it &quot;properly&quot; in Python and if that wasn&#x27;t fast enough I&#x27;d think a bit and rewrite it in C. But that&#x27;s happening less and less often these days.<p>Because C costs a bit more to write it makes me think ahead. And I&#x27;ve (once again) found that while prototyping in Python is fast it&#x27;s even faster to think and then just write C. I write some boilerplate C and start adding the data structures... this could take a &quot;long&quot; time but once I&#x27;ve figured it out, writing the actual C code is a breeze. All the mental work has already been done and once the data structures are right, the implementation just follows.<p>Curiously, this doesn&#x27;t exactly happen with Python. Because you <i>can make a Python program run</i> almost immediately, there&#x27;s nothing forcing you to the productive idleness. In C, you&#x27;ll have to write a bit of code first until you can get something meaningful up and running: this is the hatching time for what you really want to write.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t observed this with other languages. I suppose I would need to write hefty amounts of Java until I could get a program running somewhat, but this process of forced productive idleness mostly happens in C. Maybe it&#x27;s because there are no layer beneath C and assembly and you intuitively know the tradeoffs and only a negligible delta of what you write and what the machine will actually do. Maybe it&#x27;s because C feels so <i>physical</i>. I don&#x27;t know. But so far C is the only language that gives me that process in a native, intuitive way, constantly telling me that &quot;you must not rush, because you can&#x27;t rush anyway&quot;.",1417169319

If you can&#x27;t trust your provider not to read your unencrypted some of the time data, you&#x27;re using the wrong provider, and making backups much harder than they need to be.<p>Also a lot of that wishlist seems to ignore network realities - you can do a lot more with a backup server in the next rack, or one that&#x27;s the end of a private link, than you can with a very remote storage provider, so insisting on the same tools no matter where your backups are located seems a bit hopeful.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on a backup system for our customers called &quot;byteback&quot; which I&#x27;m slowly finishing off and documenting - will only be 2-3000 lines of Ruby when finished.<p>It currently leans on rsync, ssh and btrfs&#x27;s copy-on-write snapshots to keep efficient copies of entire servers.  There&#x27;s a server-side pruning algorithm that allows the disc to fill up with daily snapshots for multiple servers, then prunes the least &quot;useful&quot; ones.<p>It&#x27;s trying to be zero-configuration, so it builds its list from a list of &quot;local&quot; filesystems, so that you can copy the whole snapshot back quickly to restore a system.<p>The only other feature I&#x27;m going to need is to automatically drive &quot;snapshot&quot; functionality when it finds it on the server - e.g. LVs, btrfs subvolumes and other points on the filesystem where it can make a safe snapshot, it should do that automatically.<p>The zero-configuration rationale is just that where we&#x27;ve had backup failures, it&#x27;s been manual misconfigurations and misguided attempts to be &quot;efficient&quot; that caused important files to be missed.  So I&#x27;m trying to bake in defaults and features to cover every mistake we&#x27;ve ever made :)<p>As the name implies it&#x27;s made for our customers, and our defaults, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll work for a lot of other server use cases as well.  I&#x27;m still going over a few 10s of live backups fixing problems and adding new defaults as I find them.  If anyone&#x27;s interested, shout and I&#x27;ll try to push on with the documentation and put it up in its current state.",1417169285

You measure the radiation in the room and sure enough the radiation is very weak. You conclude &quot;See? Fukushima is no worse than natural radiation&quot;. Now what happens if you&#x27;re so unfortunate to inhale that speck of material and it settles in your lungs?

Thanks for engaging in discussion :)<p>Your argument is certainly reasonable and logical! What I disagree with is the starting premise of &quot;fair == same standard of living == same % of disposable income&quot; and your characterization of candidates not subscribing to that reasoning as &quot;greedy&quot;. (&quot;Same standard of living&quot; would make a lot of sense if your company was based in Bangalore and trying to hire in London -- e.g ensuring &quot;minimum standard of living&quot; -- not that you&#x27;d be able to hire in London with Bangalore rates.).<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that ultimately it all boils down to what the market will bear, and you&#x27;re happy with your ability to hire to your desired standard the way you&#x27;re doing it -- which is great! I&#x27;m afraid however that it&#x27;s a bit overly enthusiastic to say that this has anything to do with whether your compensation policy is fair.<p>As a candidate, I would expect to at least be told about this compensation policy before spending any time on the interview process -- I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree, and perhaps start doing so if you&#x27;re not doing so already :)<p>Cheers!<p>P",1417168964

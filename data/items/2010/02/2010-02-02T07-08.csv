1094544,comment,1094285,1094285,0,0,minalecs,,,"1.  Well before joining a startup you should be sure of two things, you believe in the product, and you believe in the founders.  
2.  If you plan joining a startup , plan on being there for at least two years, before you decide if it will pan out or not.  
3.  Expect to work a lot more than you probably are.  
4.  You're current job won't be as hurt as you think, believe me life goes on at every company, and you're leaving won't hurt as much as you think and should not be part of your consideration.  
5.  If you really want to work on something innovative to expand your skills work on your own product that interests you on your free time.
good luck",1265096867

There were a few weak performers. If they were mediocre, they slipped by unnoticed; if they were really bad, they would get a ton of performance improvement meetings, second chances, etc, and firing was put off for as long as possible.

Since nine out of ten investments fail, they need to fund companies that have a chance of giving a 10x return <i>just to break even</i>.

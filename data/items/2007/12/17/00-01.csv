There are 4 directions you can move from X.<p>""Meta"" - you can ask the set of questions ""what can we say about claims about X?""<p>""Anti-meta"" - you can ask the questions ""what can X say about other things?"" (make X a meta-concept of some other concept)<p>""General"" - you can ask the question ""do there exist generalizations of X?"" (commonly known as abstraction, although the term is ambiguous - generalization is more precise)<p>""Specific"" - you can ask the question ""do there exist instances of X?""<p>Answering questions in these 4 directions gives you information about what you really want to know - what is X? What is ""true"" of X?<p>Philosophy is exploration and characterization of this ""idea space."" Nothing more. Nothing less. Very useful, if people would only do it once in a while.<p>---<p>Quick example:<p>""What is free-will?"" = X<p>Meta:<p>Does free-will correspond to a thing? What classes of things is it in? What are our intuitions? What can we meaningfully say about free-will? <p>Anti-meta:<p>Suppose we define free-will well. What concepts does it enable? Are those concepts meaningful?<p>General:<p>Are there generalizations of free-will? How about just plain old ""will""? What can we say about ""will""? How about ""freedom?"" What's that?<p>Specific:<p>Are there any hard-and fast examples of free will? Are there any ""thought-experiments"" we can perform to try to shake out our intuitions? For instance, if everything were systematic/deterministic, what would this imply?<p>---<p>My claim is that this method is useful for getting terms to be well-defined in the way that PG requires of math. You just keep doing this sort of analysis over and over until you get down to essential definitions.<p>Best to start from the bottom, though.",1197852735

I started buying camera equipment and found that I greatly enjoyed it.  So now when I don't have anything good to program, or want an interesting break, I grab my camera and walk around taking photos.  It gives me time to unwind and relax, but I'm still being productive -- just in a different sense.",1197852481

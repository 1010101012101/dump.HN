By definition it is owned by him alone and if you transfer the IP to the company, then you are transferring it to him and you have no stake.  I am not sure what effect a contract would have, but I think he would be in a position to do what he wanted with the company and you'd have no official stake.

You can even do LegalZoom though it's not typically recommended, but you can just re-do your corporation when you get funded.

My guess would be that you don't live an as expensive a metro area as the author is basing his calculations on.<p>In a place like San Francisco, a few non-frivolous expenses can add up quickly:<p>- Your residence. A decent 2 bedroom place in a desirable part of San Francisco will run $3,000 per month in rent, a mortgage will be much higher. We're not talking anything extravagant here, just 600-900 sq ft.<p>- Travel. Paying for more than one person to travel to visit family/friends a few times a year can easily add up to $1,000 or more per month. We're not talking luxury vacations here, either -- just basic airfare (coach) and accommodations.<p>- Health expenses. As you earn more, you'll probably be more likely to spend more on optional health items. Things like LASIK for example. Also, as you get older, these expenses will get much larger.<p>- Kids. It doesn't even have to be private school we're talking about, but I imagine that clothing/feeding/entertaining more than one person adds up quickly.<p>- Any time/money trade-off. You have a limited amount of time and, similar to health expenses, you will be more likely to spend money to save time as you earn more. Each person's choices will be different here, but again, we're not talking luxury. Maybe paying for parking instead of a time intensive bus trip? Or arranging for laundry service? Or paying an unjust $40 bill that would otherwise take you 5 hours to fight?<p>Notice there's no talk of fancy cars, big screen TVs, luxury trips, large mansions, or extravagant dinners.

It had hilarious 80s-era retro styling with angles reminiscent of <i>Tron</i>, and it admittedly has been through an engine and transmission rebuild in the last 24 years, but it still runs great (for the friend I sold it to) and doesn't cost much more to maintain than any car of that age would cost.<p>It is marginally less fuel efficient than many cars, despite its tiny size, and one does go through tires when one is tearing off the starting line at the entrance ramp to 101. Fast cars are more expensive than regular cars. But not necessarily much so.<p>Of course, if your definition of a fast car includes the word ""Chevy"" or, god help you, ""Porsche"" I take back everything I said. ;)",1282593753

Glenside, PA, population less than 10,000, probably one of the most backwards suburbs I've ever had the pleasure of living in, is home to Newgrounds.com. Regardless, this is the GD internet, you shouldn't have to actually be in Orlando to do good work for a company in Orlando. My employer currently has clients on the other side of the country. Neither we nor our client is ever going to admit that a full country's worth of distance and a 3 hour timezone disparity has a significant impact on the quality of our services. Even when I lived in the middling town of Chambersburg, where the first sizable city was Harrisburg at nearly an hour away, there were always options for programming employment in town. I took a 4 mile walk from Glenside to Ambler one Saturday and walked past 3 tech firms along the way.<p>That's the thing, can anyone in any industry in this age afford to <i>not</i> have a sizable interest in computing and internet technology? Even Doodie Calls couldn't get away with running a paper business, and all they do is drive around in vans and scoop dog poop. If you're big enough to have employees, you're big enough to have tech need that can't be filled by your 15 year old nephew for weekend soda money. Maybe in 1985, when the vast majority of the population had no idea you could even link computers together nation-wide, it made sense to band together to take down the few companies that had tech need. But today is completely different.",1282593753

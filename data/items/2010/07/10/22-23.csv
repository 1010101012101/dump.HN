Personally, I only remember seeing falling blocks in my head, never looking at buildings at fitting them together, as referenced by the Wikipedia article.<p>You're so old school, by the way. Haha. Nobody around my age (21) ever regularly played on anything other than a TI graphing calculator. There was a great viral effect to this, in that when you downloaded the game from someone else's calculator, you inherited the high scores on their game as well. It's funny to think about some current high school freshman playing tetris on his calculator and thinking, 'Who the hell is this Towle guy? What an asshole.'<p>And on top of that, the ubiquitousness of the versions of tetris on those calculators allowed for true player-to-player comparison. Sure, there was way more than one version available, but you might be surprised how few would ever use play non-standard. Let's see just how ubiquitous they were/are! (Hopefully someone responds with scores that make logical sense by comparison. Otherwise I'm going to look more ridiculous than absurd.)<p>Can anyone beat ~42k on the TI-86 version? Or ~498k on the TI-89 version? Or have inherited high scores in that range? (Note: a good, experienced player on those versions would have high scores around in the low 30-thousands and 300-thousands, respectively. I was obsessed, wouldn't beat my own scores for months before having an ""in the zone"" game, pushing them significantly higher each time.)<p>{Damn right.

The topic under discussion is this statement you made:<p>""There are really only TWO decisions that google made that made them successful""<p>> Adwords allowed Google make money<p>What in the world do you think ""success"" means?  Despite the fact that this forum is called Hacker News, it isn't really about hacking per se.  It's about starting companies.  ""Success"" in such endeavors is not measured by how many people use your product, it is measured by whether or not you make money.  To be sure, all else being equal it is easier to make money with a large market share than a small one.  But you can make money without a large market share (e.g. the Apple Macintosh), and you can have a large market share without making any money (e.g. the Apache web server).<p>So maybe you meant to say, ""There are really only two decisions that Google made that allowed them to achieve a large market share"" or something like that (though even that is arguable).  But ""large market share"" and ""success"" are not the same thing.<p>But in September of 2000 Google had neither success nor a large market share.  All they had then was a kick-ass product and a really good team.  Again, all else being equal, having a kick-ass product is helpful.  But it is neither necessary (c.f. Microsoft) nor sufficient (c.f.

I'm currently up to my eyeballs at Ushahidi (www.ushahidi.com), the iHub (www.ihub.co.ke) and AfriGadget (www.afrigadget.com).<p>You'll note that I was specifically saying that it does not appear to make business sense for some of these web organizations to pay attention to Africa.

However, it's interesting to note who is paying attention and who is putting money into figuring out how to monetize the web and mobile space in Africa.  A couple:<p>Google - Google Kenya was the first independent office (sales, engineering and product development) that they had in the world.<p>Facebook - I didn't see this coming at all, but they were the first to zero-rate their site.<p>Nokia - Nokia runs a couple research labs on the continent and spends a good amount of resources figuring out customer needs.<p>Though there are startling opportunities, and the chance to make real (big) money in  Africa, it isn't where you want to put your money first to turn a quick buck.

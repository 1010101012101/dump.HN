How so? If we accept the idea that extroverts are in the CEO / politician / sports star / etc positions, then you have to accept that the extroverts are the ones the hold all of the power. If the introverts are 'building the next Facebook/LinkedIn,' that gives them relatively little power: 1) politicians can make your product illegal 2) there are relatively few success-stories that give founders enough money to be considered in a position of 'power' (how many failed Facebooks are there for every Facebook).<p>I'm not throwing in on either side of the 'this is reality vs this is fantasy' argument, but if we assume that it is reality, your idea that it's balanced doesn't seem to hold up.",1300603819

(1) Connecting professionals of same interest - to some extent it has succeeded but not fully
(2) Help recruiters find authentic talent - it has failed
(3) Help expert employees to build credential portfolio/profile that can be trusted by future employers - It could have done a lot on that front but doesn't seem to be<p>Some of the feature I personally used and felt frustrated because of its incompleteness:
1) Adding professional contact - for many of us, colleagues are from different companies e.g. client side team working with us on the same project. There is no relevant option to add these contacts which would say ""worked together on a project""
2) Polls - Don't know what's wrong; may be many things, but never got it working as I could liked it to be.
3) Status update - why does this site need one? Have you seen a single person posting updates regularly through this feature and telling people what he is working on?
4) Travel Info - What's the point? If you are travelling to a city, what was the site expecting? People would come receive you at the airport? Or schedule a business meeting with you without any prior talks? Or plan something like that? Would you find time, if so?
5) Misused by HR people.<p>My observation is it tried to do many things without having a clear goal and so haven't succeeded in any of it. I am not measuring 'success' by number of active users but how well it satisfies those users with everything they want to achieve through this platform.

We take 1.5% of each FaceCash transaction on the merchant side, plus fees (also on the merchant side) for coupons that are delivered to the FaceCash app and then result in a sale. We'll also start charging for some parts of ThinkLink (the built-in accounting suite) like payroll, eventually.",1300601275

People keep their email addresses reasonably up to date, so I can contact them if they change their info.<p>2. Somewhat useful - people keep their jobs/companies they are working for up to date.<p>3. If someone introduces themselves to me in a business context, one of the first steps we take is to establish a relationship on linked in.  That immediately gives me insight into their background, and, some clues (but no guarantees) as to their legitimacy.  In particular, 95% of the time we're only two-hops away, and more than 50% of the time we know somebody in common - so I can quickly drop a line to someone I trust personally and get the inside scoop on this new associate of mine.<p>Anybody who is trying to use Linked In for more than a Rolodex is missing the point.  It really is nothing more.<p>Also, (And I'm not sure if this is just me) - I have about 300 or so facebook friends, and about 400 Linked-In contacts, and, with maybe a half-dozen exceptions - there is no intersection between the two sets.  I don't share pictures, wall-history, or personal updates with business colleagues, and, I have no desire to pollute my linkded in rolodex with every aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, ex-girlfriend that I've acquired in the last 10 years.",1300601201

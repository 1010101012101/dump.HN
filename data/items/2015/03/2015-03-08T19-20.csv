I&#x27;ve seen a terrible hire cause more than $1M of damage in the year it took for him to get fired.<p>While I think that these sorts of people are rather rare within the population of engineers at large, they appear much more often in the interview process as they are more likely to need a job, and probably have to interview many more times before they find their way into a company.<p>That said, I do agree with the author that extremely deep technical interviews are also unreasonable. Variants of FizzBuzz are generally enough to weed out the terrible engineers and it&#x27;s pretty hard to tell the good from the great until you&#x27;ve actually worked together.",1425844702

That&#x27;s the point of the comment you&#x27;re replying to.<p>There exist <i>good</i> interview questions, where you give lots of facts to the candidate and make it clear that they can ask if they don&#x27;t remember the order of arguments to reduce(). (In fact, a good way to put them at ease is to admit that <i>you</i> don&#x27;t remember either, and are just looking up the documentation :-P )<p>But if, given those bare facts, they can&#x27;t write a legible and correct binary search even over multiple iterations, or reason about O() complexity of an algorithm they either just implemented, or just <i>came up with</i>, they are probably an STE.<p>In my experience, these people fall into one of two categories: new graduates who just barely scraped through their college classes, and people misrepresenting their past jobs in QA or product management as programming experience. (That isn&#x27;t to say that non-CS-majors shifting into coding can&#x27;t be great engineers - I know several! But when interviewing one, you can&#x27;t make the assumption of basic competence, and it&#x27;s a red flag if they play up their non-programming work rather than talk about actual coding experience/studies.)",1425844585

Over 20+ years, he was a consultant for firmware development at 28 positions. The non technical portion of the interview went great and I said I wanted to ask a few coding questions. He was really resistant and used all kinds of excuses. I told him to humor me and code something simple like draw how a linked list works and how the to write the insert function in C. At the point I was totally caught off guard. He knew not a single like of C syntax and just made things up. He didn&#x27;t understand the concept of pointers at all. Later when I talked with my co-workers they had the same feedback. He didn&#x27;t know how to program at all. We wondered how he consulted at 28 companies for the last two decades!",1425844270

I haven&#x27;t stated that narrative you wrote.<p>Point #1: The Espionage Act of 1917 is a horrid piece of legislation. The defendant can offer no defense to justify it, as Ellsberg found out. The prosecution doesn&#x27;t need to show that there&#x27;s even the potential to cause harm. What you wrote, saying Snowden should be considered a patriot deserves at most 10 years in federal prison, is completely ignored by the law. There no legal defense for &quot;Snowden based on his intentions&quot;.<p>Simply put, nothing you wrote in defense of Snowden is relevant to his prosecution.<p>Point #2: I brought up Petraeus in response to your statement that:<p>&quot;This is the balanced response that is needed to keep copycats from recklessly harming national security while at the same time strengthening our collective priority on government transparency.&quot;<p>We also need a way to keep copycat ex-CIA heads and generals from sharing secrets with unauthorized people and from lying to FBI agents. We have laws which define the rules. They make no exception for generals, and Petraeus signed over a dozen NDAs where he agreed that he would not reveal any secrets. These are the rules he&#x27;s subject to, but the &quot;balancing&quot; here is being done completely pre-trial, with no transparency, in order to avoid prosecution under the laws that clearly say that Petraeus committed several felonies.<p>It seems that if you&#x27;re friends with people in high places, you get special favors. If they don&#x27;t like you, you get treated like Wen Ho Lee or worse. This is not justice under the law. If Petraeus, or Scotter Libby, or others with high position get little more than a handslap, while Lee gets solitary confinement, then I have little faith that we have a &quot;balanced response&quot;.<p>Point #3: As I pointed out, It&#x27;s not simply a matter of Petraeus sharing secrets that went no further than his biographer. He also made false statements to the FBI. This is a felony under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. It&#x27;s the law that made Martha Stewart a convicted felon.<p>I mentioned this earlier. Do you ignore it because it doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative you want to impose upon those you disagree with? This speaks ill of you.<p>Point #4: Being a decorated war veteran is irrelevant. There is no special get-out-of-felony card written in the law for being a veteran, decorated or otherwise. Or put it this way, if Snowden had been a decorated war veteran - say, a Purple Heart - how would that change things for you? What if he had a Congressional Medal of Honor? Two Medals of Honor? What if Petraeus had been the one to leak the information, rather than Snowden? What if Petraeus&#x27; biographer had been the one to the leak the information?<p>If being a war hero is relevant, then surely all of those cases would make you want to be more lenient, yes? How much lenient?<p>If you can&#x27;t give a good answer - and I really don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible - then I&#x27;ll assume that your reference to war hero status is a post hoc justification that has no actual bearing on the matter but exists mostly for the rhetorical sympathy.",1425843485

Code reviews for these people always end up with them defensive - you will see a lot of remarks along the lines of, &quot;isn&#x27;t it good enough though?&quot;, &quot;it works with the one input I tried&quot;, &quot;yeah that would be better but that would require me to do more work to change something, vs just hit merge on the pull request&quot;, etc.<p>You can try and help improve their workflow, give tips, point out faster or better ways of doing something, only to come by to help them 2 weeks later and see them still stubbornly doing something the slow way.<p>They treat code they don&#x27;t write as a black box, or &quot;owned&quot; by the person that wrote it. You will encounter, &quot;Hey, I was having a problem with X, and I traced it down to this function in the Foo subsystem. I think I heard you wrote the Foo subsystem. Could you take a look at this?&quot; When you try to help, you realize they navigated to this point and then didn&#x27;t spend 1 minute trying to read the code and see what&#x27;s going on. You might take time and give a good overview of it, how it works, offer to answer further questions, etc. It goes in one ear, out the other. Three days later the exact same question comes up.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a programmer get thrust into the node.js world without prior experience. I offered a few suggestions for learning resources, and offered to loan a book. He said, &quot;Yeah, I really try not to read books like that or spend that kinda time outside the office. I&#x27;ll figure it out.&quot;<p>I could go on and on with anecdotes, but I think the reality is there are people who are very into the craft, and WILL be quick learners (of that which they don&#x27;t already know), and there are plenty that don&#x27;t. For those of us that do strive to improve and get better, working with the former is a terrible  demotivator.<p>A step further, I think that the former group will slowly attribute to technical debt, or just over time make your code base harder to work with. You can&#x27;t micromanage forever, and having to harp on the same things time and time again in code reviews is draining for both parties. Eventually you start giving in, and letting sub-standard work through, because to do otherwise will make you seem like a nagger, nit-picker, etc. Then one day you have to edit something they touched, and your own task takes 10 times longer due to tons of coupling, faulty assumptions, things they didn&#x27;t bother to learn about how the overall component works, etc.<p>The &quot;hazing&quot; style of interview surely does suck, and I myself don&#x27;t go for standard library trivia, or ask algorithm questions that would never come up on the job. But more and more, I feel that they are used throughout the valley for lack of a better way to defend against someone joining the team that&#x27;s going to be a net negative. I think the thought might be that it&#x27;s extremely hard to detect the person that can&#x27;t be bothered to read through the code base, and figure out how things work a little before giving up and asking someone else to hold there hand - yet if one can make it through one of these tough interviews, there&#x27;s a higher chance they aren&#x27;t that person.<p>Another aspect is that I feel like once people get IN in tech, few companies are willing to make corrections. Someone can consistently write bugs, or submit code to the repo it was clear they didn&#x27;t even test against the base cases of input/usage, give estimates that are WAY long for simple tasks, not pay attention in meetings, etc - but many companies are afraid to fire, or give harsh feedback. From what I&#x27;ve read, Netflix is one company that does not seem to operate this way.<p>Perhaps we&#x27;d all be more trusting in our interviews if we didn&#x27;t know that the false positive would be so hard to correct.",1425843310

Animation in the f&#x27;n firmware built-in boot manager.<p>Bad: That boot manager hard wires a label &quot;Windows&quot; for any legacy CSM-BIOS installed OS, even if it isn&#x27;t Windows.<p>Mixed: Apple&#x27;s firmware is mainly based on Intel 1.10, with some extensions such as UEFI GOP, and some Apple stuff. It&#x27;s not a standard UEFI 2.x firmware at all, and it&#x27;s not documented at all. 3rd party bootloader programs have to have physical access to Macs to poke them with a stick in order to figure out how they work due to Apple&#x27;s closed nature. So if you care about running open source OS&#x27;s on Apple hardware, this is probably more &quot;bad&quot; than &quot;mixed&quot;.<p>Very bad: There&#x27;s a long standing pernicious bug with Disk Utility, on Boot Camp&#x27;d drives (OS X + Windows) which permits the user to resize the OS X volume thereby creating a 5th partition: ESP, OS X, New Partition, Apple Boot, Windows. And Apple&#x27;s tools remove the hybrid MBR, replace it with a protective MBR, and now Windows is unbootable. All without warning. This behavior violates their own proscription against manipulating drives with hybrid MBRs. Technote 2166: &quot;If block 0 contains any other form of MBR, it should refuse to manipulate the disk.&quot; Their message boards have hundreds of such complaints. This isn&#x27;t new, it&#x27;s been a problem for years, it was bug reported years ago, and Apple basically blamed it on Windows rather than their own tool which actually causes the problem by wiping out the PMBR.

9166770,comment,9163657,9166275,0,0,geofft,,,"That&#x27;s not how the shim works.<p>The shim loader is an MIT-licensed piece of code that&#x27;s signed by a Secure Boot CA, typically MS for off-the-shelf x86 hardware. The shim has another public key hard-coded into it, and verifies that the next bootloader (usually GRUB 2) is signed with that key. It works around a couple of issues:<p>- The turnaround time for getting something signed by MS is slow. Linux distros want to be able to push out a new version of GRUB on their own. So by having the CA sign a shim loader, new versions of the boot loader can be signed with the distro&#x27;s key alone, which they can automate as much as they want.<p>- There&#x27;s some ambiguity over the GPLv3&#x27;s TiVoization clause, so to avoid any interpretation that MS would have to hand over its own private key, MS won&#x27;t sign any GPLv3 software directly (like GRUB). The distros think this is a non-issue, and they&#x27;re happy to sign their own GRUB binaries without imagining they&#x27;d have to give up their private keys.<p>It doesn&#x27;t change the security model of Secure Boot at all. You&#x27;re still verifying that someone whose key is in hardware has a trust path to your bootloader. It&#x27;s just that the trust path is one more step away.<p>If you want to include your distro&#x27;s key in the UEFI variable that lists your Secure Boot CA roots, you can do that, and skip the shim. (You probably can&#x27;t remove MS&#x27;s key because UEFI drivers are signed with it, but that&#x27;s a different issue.)<p>Some distros (notably Ubuntu) have their <i>bootloader</i> willing to boot unsigned kernels, on the grounds that Secure Boot protects UEFI &quot;boot services&quot; (things that run while UEFI still controls the machine, including access to certain UEFI variables like Secure Boot config), but does not protect ring 0. Other distros (Fedora, SuSE, etc.) think that that&#x27;s nonsense, and Secure Boot obviously protects ring 0. So their bootloader only boots signed kernels, and those kernels, in turn, only load signed kernel modules.<p>MS has complained about Ubuntu&#x27;s interpretation, but has so far not shown any signs of forcing Ubuntu to change their practices. (I suspect with no real information that MS is worried that, if they&#x27;re holding the only CA for PC hardware and they revoke the most popular Linux distro, they&#x27;re going to be reminded of what antitrust lawsuits feel like.) You can see MS&#x27;s signing policy here, including a link to the (non-MS) shim:<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windows_hardware_certification/archive/2013/12/03/microsoft-uefi-ca-signing-policy-updates.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windows_hardware_certification/archi...</a>",1425842097

Furthermore, although it is in fact exactly as secure as not having client side encryption, it misleads users into thinking that now the backend can&#x27;t read their data, etc.<p>Assume the server operators are 1) competent and 2) trustworthy.

If you do, just use SSL. If you don&#x27;t, then nothing they can provide via javascript should convince you otherwise. And them providing client side encryption so that you &quot;don&#x27;t have to trust them&quot; is infuriatingly wrong.<p>The second point is technological. Let&#x27;s say the developers are competent, and you understand that you have to trust them. Why then should you prefer that they write the encryption stuff on the backend rather than the frontend?

After dozens of interviews and resumes and a few attempts at hiring, we finally got a great candidate fit.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing -- only a very few of those candidates actually were &quot;flat-out&quot; incapable of programming, and it was pretty easy to figure that out. Of the others, most of them were capable of <i>programming,</i> but not capable of <i>developing</i>, which seemed to be the dividing line.<p>Part of my interview consisted of data-modeling exercises (from workflow documentation) and slightly more-than-basic algorithm exercises (in which I wasn&#x27;t looking for good code, so much as to understand how the candidate attacked the problems). I wasn&#x27;t trying to bigfoot the candidates, but it was amazing how many couldn&#x27;t work their way through relatively simple modeling or algorithm design problems <i>at all</i>.<p>And yet these were professional programmers. They had degrees, sometimes graduate degrees, from good universities; they had spent years in the field; they had solid references from good employers. I refuse to believe that so many practicing programmers could simply be incompetent and never raise any kind of concerns.<p>Which leads me to think that there&#x27;s something wrong with our discipline. (I remember an old USENIX symposium where one of the talks was, &quot;If computers had blood, they&#x27;d call us doctors.&quot; My reply at the time was, &quot;If computers had blood, they&#x27;d call us serial killers.&quot;) If we built bridges, we&#x27;d assign a different engineer to each leg of the bridge, start at both sides simultaneously, never bother to check flood gauges or soil samples until halfway through the project, and try to swap out the cable suspension design two weeks after opening it to traffic.<p>In other words, we take perfectly <i>capable</i> programmers and turn them into useless <i>cogs</i>. Programmers who can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees or the trees for the leaves. Who never are exposed to systems design problems, who use HashMap as the solution for every problem because we need that code yesterday and there&#x27;s no time to discuss more elegant solutions (seriously, at least half of those candidates were obsessed with HashMap, for a problem where a hash table made no sense), who are shoved into a tiny chunk of the code of a massive enterprise monstrosity and expected to keep making changes and bugfixes until the code bears no resemblance to a reasonable solution to the problem.<p>Bad programmers who don&#x27;t learn aren&#x27;t the problem. Good programmers who don&#x27;t teach <i>are</i>. Not brilliant programmers, not rock stars or code ninjas or whatever the fuck we&#x27;re calling them this week, just good, solid programmers, the sort we say we can&#x27;t find.

First, if people find out that he&#x27;s a snitch who tried to endear himself to management by selling others out, then everyone will hate him. That&#x27;s just human nature. Second, low performers can be good for your job security because (a) you don&#x27;t have to outrun the bear if layoffs or stack-ranking come-- you just have to outrun the other guy; and (b) they can anchor compensation favorably.

Nice casual game, would even be a decent mobile game.<p>The problem is that American McGee has an ego so huge it interferes with his ability to properly market and position his ideas, and for some reason thought this was AAA title material or it should be worthy of a AAA development process. So step one was &quot;license the Unreal Engine&quot;. Except the Unreal Engine, with its support for shaders and all that crap, made the game run intolerably slow even on PCs with on-mobo NVIDIA parts, let alone the shitty Intel graphics parts many PCs had at the time. Porting to Wii would have been fucking impossible; arguably, the game would have thrived on Wii as an interesting counterpoint to Hannah Montana&#x27;s Wiggle-Your-Stick Concert Bash and the usual Wii fare.<p>So yes, there&#x27;s room in this business for all sorts of game engines. And if you don&#x27;t know how to write an engine that fits your game, or at least choose a fit from a wide market, maybe you don&#x27;t know enough about the kind of game you&#x27;re making and who would be playing it.",1425841314

Those are unfortunate realities that you should be aware of and vigilant about if you&#x27;re involved in hiring. But there are also bad candidates out there, and they&#x27;re capable of doing a huge amount of damage (anyone who has worked on even a medium-sized engineering team can verify this) so the ugly truth is that being conservative with hiring makes a lot of sense.",1425841266

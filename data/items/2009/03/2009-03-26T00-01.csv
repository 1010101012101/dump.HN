Perhaps we could cork some volcanoes or do some cloud seeding to induce some rainstorms to get rid of water vapor.  Let's take your $600 billion that you say would make a huge difference.<p>As we're writing the check to the cloud-seeding company, or the volcano corking company, it occurs to you, that there's a lot of things you could do with this money.  You could use it to try to stop Iraq from developing biological weapons to kill hundred of thousands with, for instance.  Or, if you knew more than the French, the Israelis, and the U.S. did, or just didn't think that was a problem you cared about (let him do it, it's no skin off your nose), you still might think ""Wow, I could buy DDT for every man, woman, and child in Africa with this, and save millions of lives.""  Or, if you didn't want to do that, since DDT is evil and might kill birds, you might think ""I could build desalination plants to get the water to feed hungry people in arid climates. and give them relief now, not in 100 years.""<p>When you have the checkbook in your hand, and you are considering choosing to spend the money on volcano corking, or, god forbid, something actually foolish, you may, instead, say ""Hey, maybe we should be sure before we blow this money.""  I think if I gave you the checkbook, you'd think a lot differently than when somebody else has the checkbook.",1238029158
532753,comment,532374,532729,0,0,cgranade,,,"Of course it'd take more than $20 billion over the span of our lifetimes. I meant that within the context of the Iraq War spending, diverting even a few of those 600 billions of dollars could have made a very positive impact and would have meant that Bush was not completely inactive on the issue. I realize I phrased that poorly, and I'm sorry for that, but my point still stands: compared to what we spend on killing each other, the money that is being asked to save our whole way of life is chump change. Moreover, the issue of climate change runs much deeper than economics alone. Talking about rates of return and deferred action neglect the potential for catastrophe if we simply continue to do nothing.",1238029114
532751,comment,532374,532628,0,0,Tichy,,,"Not every climate expert has run a climate model in his head. Presumably sometimes they also just read papers about other people's results, and assign the a likelihood based on their own experiences. Maybe they are better at estimating likelihoods, but other than that, not so different from the common person in the street.<p>Even without knowledge in climate modeling, some things can be easily seen. For example it seems obvious that there is a debate on man made warming - some experts seem to consider it likely, others not. Credentials of experts can be checked to some degree without expertise in climate modeling, too. And so on - at every level of knowledge, it is possible to make an estimate of the probabilities, I should think.<p>Also, I think it is often politicians who decide which scientists get funding for their research, so in a way people do elect scientists (not sure how the system works in the US).",1238029088

I agree that some schools seems to breed more of what the author is referring to in the industry.  Yet I think its a blanket generalization to all MBA programs.  The MBA typically gets a bad wrap when any economic problems start to occur.  Most people will then start to quote statistics that say most of the top companies do not have MBAs at the helm, so why do we need these MBA programs?  What about those that have worked on Social Ventures during their MBAs?  Are they guilty of wasting their time in an MBA program?<p>I chose to get an MBA so that I could understand the business side of things more and to build a professional business network, the latter being the most important.

Let's see 140 million PS2's, 20 million PS3's, 45 million Wii's, and right around 27 million xbox 360's.  I'll be generous and not count the kids still gaming on the original xbox.  That makes about 233 million possible customers.  Let's be nice again and suppose that only 1% of those people are interested in worry free, console free, multiplayer high end gaming via the net.  I know, the real number is at least an order of magnitude higher, but I'm being kind.  That brings us to 2.3 million people hitting these servers a night, all of them pulling down a 720p stream.  Nightly bandwidth cost?  Now consider the computing horse power needed to generate and then compress all of those streams.  Amazon EC2 is not going to get you there.<p>But let's suppose all of this works as advertised!<p>There is no way Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo would NOT compete against you in that market, the only question is when will they make their entry.<p>Or maybe the sleeping tigers.  NVidia, Intel, and to a lesser extent AMD.  They come along and put extensions in their drivers that work only on their clouds.  Programmers have to use NVidia's drivers anyway, they do not need to use this company's SDK however.<p>But by far the greatest concern of this company should be Apple.  By making their product hardware and server software based, they are putting themselves on terrain that Apple knows FAR better than they.  In fact, Apple knows it far better than anyone in the gaming industry.  This is exactly the mistake the music industry made.  I remember video of a guy from Sony and Universal laughing at the first iPod.  What could Apple do?  Well they could come along and revolutionize your revolutionary technology.  Like, say, building an Apple gaming cloud that only talks to the iPhone, iPod Touch, and the new iTVGameConsole.  And vice versa.  They could even make an online store to buy games for their cloud.  They might call it like . . . I don't know . . . iTunes Media Store, or something like that.<p>I am not sanguine about this company's future.  But the future for technology like this is pretty bright.  I'll put my money on an Apple partnership with NVidia.",1238026382

If you're in the U.S., you're not living in a democracy, you're living in a republic.  There is a strong agenda by many people to turn it into a democracy, merely by saying it is one, and that is working, but by law, it's a republic.<p>Democracies tend to disintegrate rapidly as the populace votes themselves beer and circuses.  You see that beginning to happen now, don't you?  The populace is not, and can not, be trusted to act in a fair, impartial, and informed manner.  They're a mob.  Look at the public lynching we almost had with the AIG folks?  Even the attorneys general of New York and Connecticut got into the act.<p>When the populace proves themselves too lazy to carefully consider the repercussions of their decisions, and too proud to admit they do not know the repercussions of their decisions, then it can't end well.<p>This will not end well.",1238026079

It doesn't usually hurt anyone directly. In fact it's trying to help. If heroin, fascism, homosexuality or anorexia are bad, why not work to stop them? To oppose censorship, you need to accept that in order to censor bad things, you need to have institutions that decide what is bad (don't we already have those?) and a means of blocking them. This will lead to bad things like censoring good things. There is no way around that, just like outrunning light. That's a pretty flimsy argument to make. If it hasn't been drilled into you, you probably won't accept it.<p>This isn't something that just people in the UAE or China will not 'get.'

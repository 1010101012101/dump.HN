944119,comment,943722,943722,0,0,ankeshk,,,"To all the skeptics about MBTI: isn't it weird that the best copywriters out there study and apply MBTI in their work?<p>People who write sales letters that are mailed a few million times, or who write copy for the 30 minute infomercials - use MBTI constantly.  Before writing down a single word, they do research:<p>Step 1: Which MBTI profile dominates this particular products usage?  (For HN - it would be NT)<p>Step 2: What do these people look for - to make a decision?<p>Step 3: How do we give this information to them?<p>When millions of dollars are spent on persuasion, people bet on writing for specific MBTI profiles - and not for the general audience.  They realize that MBTI is not perfect.  But it is a good framework none the less.<p>Its like being left handed or right handed.  Being left handed doesn't mean you won't use your right hand at all.  It just means that you prefer using your left hand for most tasks.  And so it is with MBTI.  Finding your specific type doesn't mean you don't have other types in you.  It just means that you prefer one type over 15 others for most things.  And it would be smart of me to focus on that one type to persuade you.",1258358173

""At the risk of being downvoted for criticizing Microsoft"" adds little to the discussion and requires about as much courage as an American presidential candidate taking a principled stand strongly in favor of apple pie.<p>A good portion of the innovation taking place these days is on the web, and the stacks at issue aren't what the client is running (""a browser"") nearly as much as they are how you generate the stuff you pass over to them.  (I know browser incompatibilities are a headache -- a four-figure headache for me last month, actually -- but they're quickly becoming a headache that some ubermensch JS framework author suffers so that I don't have to.)<p>A portion of current innovation in tech is the web stack (notably absent from your list).  A portion of it is associated technologies that may not interact with the customer directly ever, such as cloud stuff (anything from S3 to Azure to VPSes).  A portion of that is taking the wealth of data/apps already available and reusing it in new and innovative ways.  And a portion is process innovation, which has very little to do with your technology vendor of choice and a lot to do with how you use the tools you're using.<p>I have never done development dedicated to a MS platform (although my Swing apps and web apps are most commonly used on them), but I'm pretty sure you can write A/B tests in .NET.<p>I think you get this, because you cite StackOverflow.  StackOverflow could be written in any of a dozen languages, in almost any web stack.  It isn't innovative because of magic that it does on the server side -- it is innovative because of how they have incentivized a community to work for them via the karma/badge system, how they work the StackOverflow-is-an-executable-advertisement-for-StackExchange business model, etc etc.",1258357697

944103,comment,943554,943996,0,0,mahmud,,,"Finish the sentence.<p>Hard to invent anything new if you need to keep backward ""knowledge"" compatibility.<p>Industrial PL design has always been about doing what programmers already know, but <i>gradually</i> ""better"". Not challenging them and introducing them to new concepts. As far back as the first Fortran; language designers were told to defer to the programmer's expertise, so much so that the #1 requirement for Fortran was to be an algebriac syntax over assembly language. Fortran didn't dare to do anything different than assembly (that job was left to Lisp.) That's why you see dangerous low-level constructs left in every major HLL: this is to allow the previous generation of programmers the freedom to circumvent the abstraction to get work done. It's a subtle admission of distrust of high-level concepts, because management, and studies in ""pragmatics"" tell us that programmers need to fall back on sheer muscle and primitive operators to deliver quality software.<p>PL designers and compiler hackers can wax poetic over their achievements in advancing the art, but the market prefers to keep its investment in time, money and expertise in current technologies. So what you often see is a lousy compromise between the Ideal and the Material. Inline assembly, longjmp, pointer arithmetic, unboxed immediate values, compiler directives and promises to allow the programmer to tell the compiler how to do it's job, etc.<p>The people behind Go are industrial PL designers; everything they have ever done was for immediate, pragmatic reasons. They cloned Multics to make it cheaper and simpler, doing away with much advanced time-sharing OS research and taking the bare minimum; what they produced was a multitasking OS for minicomputers that wasn't that much more sophisticated than the microcomputer OSes of that day: it was CP/M with a login screen. You can see that theme of ""simple, familiar, fast"" running through every piece of software tool Bell Labs has ever touched after that. They might appropriated a few technologies from academia, Tcl, SML/NJ, etc. but those were done by researchers brought on board from the outside. When Bell Labs got too ambitious they produced C++, not a change in tone, but a crescendo of everything they have been doing. Worse is Better.",1258357035

So I over-reacted and only bothered with technology that had been around a minimum of 2 years (or if a ""for dummies"" book on the subject came out).<p>Some of our shipping products are based on VB6, while some of the others are .NET 3.5. Generally, if some new technology adds an edge, like Entity Framework (the shiny new name for ""linq to whatever""), then we use it. Also, for internal tools, any new technology is fair game.

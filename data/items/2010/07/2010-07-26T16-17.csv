It's just more perfect than the known alternatives.<p>Trial by combat was no joke. It was the process for centuries. It presumably had the virtue of resolving disputes in a manner short of war or century-long blood feud, and its obvious bias -- toward the better fighter -- was, I'm guessing, a design feature: In the absence of government police, any judicial system that didn't weigh the odds in favor of the stronger party was liable to be ignored in favor of extrajudicial violence. Why take a guy to trial rather than just stab him in a bar fight? Well, if the trial resembles a bar fight, but one in which the winner emerges with a clean reputation and clean legal record, nobody has anything to lose by going to trial.<p>But it literally involved losing limbs and eyes, followed in short order by either the legal rights or the life of the loser.

The anecdotes are fun, but they don't really tell you how to handle some of the common concerns that come up around fees.<p>With respect to price objections, for example, the advice seems to be ""refer to their own business practices, and don't show them the wholesale price.""  That's not going to take you very far. The comment that ""making money is not a dirty word"" is valid, but doesn't tell you how to talk to your client. Better advice would be:<p>* Explain to the client how you arrived at your cost estimate or fee - often they just want to know that it wasn't made up out of thin air.  If you tell them it represents 6 weeks of design, code, test, and deployment support, they will understand better.<p>* Clients are often comparing your price to what they think it would cost them if they were using an employee.  But they don't have that employee (or an employee with the necessary knowledge/skills).  Explain to them that it there is a cost to having your resources/skills ""on tap"" for when they need it.<p>* Always be prepared to lose a job to preserve your fees. Once you give a ""discount"" it will be hard to get back to full price.  If you think your price is fair, be prepared to suggest that they talk to some other consultants.  You should have a good idea of whether your rates are high or low compared to the competition. I have even gone so far as to suggest other companies that a client could talk to, referring to them as ""the cheap option"" and ""the expensive option.""",1280162893

The typical route is to create a business entity called a WFOE[1], which lets you operate your business in China as a foreigner, and has some tax/legal advantages.  The gist I got out of the article and HN comments was that this can actually be very expensive and difficult; the application fee is inconsistent, and especially if you try to base the WFOE in a city like Beijing or Shanghai, in practice the cost can be in excess of $100k USD (of course the alleged nominal cost is lower).<p>This is from memory, so it might not be entirely accurate, but if you're considering starting a business in China you should definitely do some research into how much it will really cost to create and operate your business. There are some good resources on chinalawblog.com, and of course in the comments of HN articles about the topic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholly_Foreign_Owned_Enterprise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholly_Foreign_Owned_Enterprise</a>",1280162745

Of course with millions of hours of developer investment in a centrally managed codebase like Solaris it is possible to achieve incredible parallelism with locks, but that isn't practical for the vast majority of modern software, which continues to use ever more external libraries.<p>Clojure's STM paired with immutable data structures are an especially well suited combination that are unlike most of the research systems presented in this area.  Of course there are additional resources that will have to be managed, such as access to I/O, but I would argue that access to I/O is by far the easier problem to deal with in comparison to concurrent access to memory - primarily because I/O devices are typically accessed serially so you can just queue up requests.<p>[1]: Here's one explanation with a code example of why locks don't compose: <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/article/printableArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=SQVVQ5O0S2ACLQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleId=202802983&dept_url=/cpp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/article/printableArticle.jhtml;jsessi...</a>",1280161988

For example, the lack of pre-emptability is something that I believe most user-level thread packages now deal with.  Another issue he discusses is that under load, the kernel doesn't realize that there are 'm' degrees of parallelism.  It only sees the LWP.  But a good user-level threads package should work system-wide.<p>He also says that detachment and reattachment is more expensive than one might think.

It's a very purple state which has some very republican ideas widely popular in the state along with some very relaxed republicans which have wide voter approval.

Either way, the state is able to use typical party based agreement to get a budget passed. This works <i>well</i> in these states: If taxes get too high, fiscally conservative, tax cutting republicans get office. If services get too incomplete, public policy creating, program creating democrats are put in office, in the majority, and their party can make a budget, and taxation to go with it to support their plans.<p>The people get control over this process by booting state legislators of the wrong party when the state runs to excess in one or the other area.<p>Now in California, with this bonehead 2/3 rule, one party can get a majority (50% +1) for sure, but rarely a supermajority. That's where <i>horsetrading</i> comes in. People have to give things to the other side of the isle to get them to vote for this. And one of the things they can give to the other side of the isle would be <i>votes to stay in office and money to run for re-election</i>. And that's where the magic of special interests come in. They can cause their interested members to vote for these people who only will vote for the budget if they get something out of it. They're now getting votes/campaign contributions, so they get to keep their legislator job longer.<p>If you got rid of the 2/3rds requirement, when repubs got in office, they'd cut services, when dems got in office, you'd get new ones, and you'd match the rest of the states in the union.<p>While it turns out voter amendments turn out to often be hijacked by the special interest groups as well, <i>that is not the huge problem</i>. The property tax freeze is not the problem.<p>The fact that 1/2 the legislature has to give away the farm to get the remaining 1/6 of the legislature to pass a budget is the issue.

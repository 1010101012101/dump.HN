The problem isn't the ""free"" part because the alternatives will end up costing money in some way (ad-supported at the very least), but the giant cost drivers that the now-dead model is stuck with.

The extra employees aren't strictly necessary, though they do help (presumably over the marginal return of cash, which is about 0 when you figure in inflation).<p>BTW, Intuit's sales took off when they <i>did</i> only have 5 or 6 people.  They probably wouldn't have been able to release anything else if they hadn't hired more people - the engineers (all 2 of them ;-)) were answering phone calls all day instead of coding.  But they could've grown quite large just on Quicken.<p>There're a bunch of other ISVs that grew very large on very small teams, eg. Aladdin (StuffIt) and NullSoft (Winamp).  Weren't many of Borland's early products (Quattro Pro, Turbo Pascal) also done by teams of about 4?",1215959527

I am not sure I can put my finger on it, but you need to reconsider your fonts and white spacing<p>2. You have the ""Contact Realtor - Realtor - Listings"" next to a property, but I am not sure where you were going with the styling. It looks like an incomplete box, and the text does not flow well around it. Consider some margins<p>3. Your search seems to have an issue. There is a listed house in Pune, but when I search in all Maharashtra, I get no listings. Shouldn't the Pune listing show up?<p>4. At the top of each tab, it always says, ""You are here\nHome"" no matter what tab you are on.<p>5. Your theme is very confusing. You seem to have nice shiny reflective Web2.0 divs on the left hand side, while your right side are flat grey sections. Whats with that?<p>6. Most importantly, what differentiates your site from other housing sites out there? Maybe I missed it, but its not very apparent to me, and I am not sure it will be apparent to others...<p>Hope this helps.<p>Good luck.",1215958964

668948,comment,668804,668804,0,0,pmjordan,,,"A lot of these are personal preference and borderline traditionalist, and as pointed out by others, the dynamic binding one is in fact not strictly true.<p>One thing that <i>does</i> however bother me about Clojure is the interaction of dynamic binding and lazy evaluation. Allow me to illustrate:<p><pre><code>  => (def *test* 0)
  #'user/*test*
  => (binding [*test* 2]
       (map #(* % *test*) '(1 2 3)))
  (0 0 0)
</code></pre>
The call to <i>map</i> is lazy, and the returned seq is only evaluated once it hits the 'P' of REPL, which is outside the dynamic binding of <i>test</i>. If you surround the <i>map</i> call with <i>(doall</i> and <i>)</i>, the result is (2 4 6).<p>This is of course a trivial case, but I've been bitten by this in practice where the binding, lazy sequence and var evaluation were a few call steps apart, and it's always been very unpleasant. Most of the time, it's involved vars which don't have a root binding, so it throws an error, but in other cases it's a lot more serious.<p>I guess the same problem can be provoked in both Clojure and CL by returning a closure evaluating that var to back outside the dynamic binding, but since you'd be explicitly invoking the closure, it's a lot more obvious what's going to happen than the ""magic"" that is lazy evaluation.",1245686102

668921,comment,668668,668867,0,0,sunir,,,"I don't think it's like how a company's revenue drops. Money does really exist; it's backed by future promises of labour and/or resources and/or things you build.<p>The money actually does disappear. That's how our debt-based currency system works. Money is created through loans (from the central bank), which are granted because you agree to pay it back through your own industry--that is future labour you do and/or resources you extract and/or things you build. If a loan goes bad, that money is destroyed.<p>Because loans require interest, this pushes the economy to continue to expand through increased industry. Eventually it cannot expand any further, and the only way to move forward is to have a wave of bankruptcies. The survivors buy assets on the cheap which then inflate in value after the economy recovers. That helps them pay back their own interest.<p>This cycle creates a bit of punctuated equilibrium where the strong (at the point of economic collapse) survive, and the weak die off. This creates room for a new phase of growth and innovation.<p>The trick for you is to be in a strong position at the front of a recession rather than a weak position so you can make it through to the new phase of growth. This is also why people say it's good to start / build a business in a recession.<p>However, the more important trick is the banks must keep the creation of debt to within the bounds the economy can withstand. After the Great Depression a series of regulations were put in place to keep things under control, but since Reagan, the banks have been increasingly deregulated. This led to such things as the real estate bubble in the 80's, the Savings and Loan crisis, the Dot-Com bubble, and the Subprime Mortgage Crisis we're in right now.<p>If this is abstract, think of it this way. The worst thing a government can do is create so much debt that they have sold off their entire population's labour for decades to foreign creditors. That sounds a bit menacing! ;)",1245684980

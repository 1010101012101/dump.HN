What matters for that purpose is not whether he's right for most ten-year stretches; it's whether he would be right for most stretches in which money managers played martingale games as widely as they have in the last few.  (If you limit it to ten-year stretches, you can game the metric by adjusting the frequency of the negative outcome to once per century.)<p>Since the expectation (integral of probability density times outcome) of such games can be net-negative, he might be.  It depends on how prevalent those games are.<p>There's another angle, too.  What matters for the economy as a whole is not one player's expected outcome, but the sum of  the expected outcomes over all the players.",1229820693

There are different carriers offering different plans. Sometimes the same carrier will offer different things based on the <i>zip code</i> you live in.<p>My recommendation to anyone looking for health insurance is to find a broker. It doesn't cost you anything extra, and they can look specifically at what your situation is and make recommendations based on that.<p>If you went to someone for your business insurance, then the chances are high that the same people can either talk to you about health insurance options or can point you the direction of someone who can.<p>Insurance offerings can be very complicated things; a broker who makes their money from dealing with insurance tends to have a pretty good awareness of what works and what doesn't.<p>Before people pipe in saying that broker will only offer you things that make them the most money; the difference between what a broker makes on the worst carrier (for them) and the best is <i>maybe</i> 2%. It's worth far more to them to keep you as a happy customer for as long as possible, because as long as you pay your insurance bill, that broker will continue to make commissions on it. (Even so, the carriers will give you the same rate directly as they would through a broker).",1229818039

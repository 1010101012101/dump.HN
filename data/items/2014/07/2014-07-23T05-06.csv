8073105,comment,8065608,8067836,2,0,deathanatos,,,"Any purpose. Just about anything that &quot;iterates over a string&quot;, in my opinion, is going to be more correct when considered at the code point level than at the code unit level. Some concrete examples:<p>- Truncating a string, perhaps to append &quot;…&quot; to it. I definitely don&#x27;t want to truncate in the middle of a surrogate pair or two UTF-8 code units into a three code unit sequence. In fact, code points isn&#x27;t good enough here either, as I don&#x27;t want to clip an accent if someone has the string (&quot;e&quot; + ACUTE_ACCENT).<p>- Determine the width of a string, for something like columns, or pixels. Code units are meaningless. Especially in regards to terminal columns, this problem comes up often. Are you rendering the output of a SQL table in a pretty ASCII table? Then you need to append spaces to a short string until you reach the &quot;|&quot;, and far too many times I&#x27;ve seen this:<p><pre><code>    | 1 | Some text in here. | another column |\n    | 2 | résumé           | another value  |\n</code></pre>\nMySQL does this. Here, the rendering is broken because the function thought an accute accent took a column. I&#x27;ve seen both the need for something higher than code points (this example) because some code points really take no space (typically, because they combine), and the example that multi-byte UTF-8 strings just got byte counted. I&#x27;ve had a linter (pylint) tell me a line was too long — over 80 columns — when it was in fact closer to ~70 columns, and well under 80. The problem? `if 80 < len(line)`, where line is a bytestring.<p>My point is that I struggle to come up with an example that is more conceptually valid at the code unit level than at the code point level. Because of this, this — code points \u00AD- is the _bare minimum_ level of abstraction language designers should deliver to programmers. As many of my examples show, even that might be woefully insufficient, which makes it all the worse to have to work with code units.",1406095146

Suppose we have N transactions in a block each with value: value_1, value_2, ... , value_N and corresponding fees: fee_1, ..., fee_N, are we making the assumption that (fee_1 + fee_2 + ... feeN) >= value_i for each i? I guess not and I suppose we are relying on the fact that even if the above isn&#x27;t true, a dishonest transactor/miner would not able to attack the system because s/he doesn&#x27;t have 51% of the network? If so, then it appears there is a somewhat surprising relationship between the largest transaction that can be securely carried out on the network and the hashrate of the network. Because when a transaction above than a certain value needs to be carried out, it might become profitable to just buy up enough hashpower to be able to reverse it later!<p>Is the above train of thought logical or am I missing something?<p>And if all of the above is correct, I&#x27;d be curious to know what an estimate of the largest safe transaction for the current bitcoin network is.",1406094223

The way the OS usually handles interrupts isn&#x27;t sufficiently precise and accurate.

I hear from more and more people that either they have left or &quot;wish [they] could&quot;, if it weren&#x27;t for &quot;everyone&quot; with which they wish to stay in contact[1].<p>I myself deactivated my account 6 months ago. The only time I regret it is after I&#x27;ve been drinking and want to troll someone. So actually all around a good thing.<p>Are new people actually, really, honestly joining Facebook? I know the &quot;delta new accounts&quot; number is positive, but do they represent real people, rather than just spam bots?<p>I just have this feeling that, given a certain plateauing of new users, there comes an associated stagnation of follow-actions. No, I certainly don&#x27;t have data to this issue, but I know that I personally only spend effort following people when A) I first join a site, or B) I think there is a good chance the person will follow me back[2]. So, for your everyday Joe-blow user who has is more than a month old, it seems like they are either already following William Shatner or never will.<p>My own observations in blogging have been that engagement with users is highly dependent on novelty. You either grind out finding new followers who haven&#x27;t experienced your content yet, or you post radically new things all of the time--which could backfire and alienate your established followership, though honestly by that point they are probably ignoring your posts. Either way, you write off anyone who has been following you for more than 6 months. 90% of the time, that person is unretrievable.<p>I guess I just see followers as a limited, unsustainable resource, sort of akin to oil, except much easier to deplete. But it seems like Facebook, et. al., are banking on it being more like solar. IDK, I&#x27;ve seen reports saying FB has 1.3 billion users. There are only 7 billion people in the world. Do I really believe FB has almost 20% of the entire world&#x27;s population? Do I really believe they could get more?<p>[1] Apparently &quot;everyone&quot; doesn&#x27;t know how to use email or a telephone or text messaging.<p>[2] Incidentally, a policy that works for about 50% of cases. And for 90% of people, they will be unfollowed within a week, regardless of whether or not they follow me back.

One form of weak-ordering is the inevitable jitter that comes with having multiple processes, threads or machines; without some kind of global lock (which would be impactful to performance) it stops being possible to have a true before/after relationship between individual log entries.<p>Another form of weak ordering is that it&#x27;s very common for log entries to be recorded only at the end of an operation, irrespective of its duration; so a single instantaneous entry really represents a time-span of activity with all sorts of fuzzy before/after/concurrent-to relationships to other entries.<p>But maybe the most overlooked kind of weak ordering is one that is rarely found in logging systems, but is highly desirable: log streams should ideally be processed in LIFO order. If you&#x27;re building some kind of analytical or visualisation system or near real-time processor for log data, you care most about &quot;now&quot;. Inevitably there are processing queues and batches and so on to deal with; but practically every logging system just orders the entries by &quot;time&quot; and handles those queues as FIFO. If a backlog arises; you must wait for the old data to process before seeing the new. Change these queues and batching systems to LIFOs and you get really powerful behavior; recent data always takes priority but you can still backfill historical gaps. Unix files are particularly poorly suited to this pattern though - even though a stack is a simple data-structure, it&#x27;s not something that you can easily emulate with a file-system and command line tools.",1406092513

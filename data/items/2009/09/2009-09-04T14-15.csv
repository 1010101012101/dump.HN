I was following the David Allen ""Getting Things Done"" method for about a year, and it was great, but eventually I couldn't keep up.  I just found myself kind of passively rebelling against the whole idea of productivity -- refusing to look at my next action lists, playing sudoku on my phone, just wasting time wherever I could.  I think when you get in a situation like that, the only thing to do is a full restart -- reevaluate everything on your plate and decide what's important to you.<p>Lately I've found that I can avoid burnout by having 2 different projects going at the same time.  But they need to be in completely different domains.  For example, I'm working on a stealth startup and training for a marathon.  I rest my body while working on the computer, I rest my mind while out on my runs.  Yin and Yang.  Doing things this way, everything gets done that needs to, and I always feel like whatever I'm doing is a fun break from something else.",1252076025

- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, position and momentum of a particle cannot both be known because they each influence each other.
- Turing Halting problem proof when a program is executed using itself as input.
- Human self awareness ? If I think about what I'm thinking about what am I thinking about ?
- Godel's proof that any formal system strong enough to be useful is either incomplete or inconsistent, to use an analogy he 
  proves this by stating in the language of the system the statement ""this statement cannot be proved in this system"".  If it can
  be proved the system lied (is inconsistent) or if it cannot be proved the statement is a truth that the system cannot prove and
  hence the system is incomplete. (Obviously he doesn't use statements like that, he uses facts about the natural numbers but the same
  principle applies)

  a model of themselves ?<p>Ok, so if this 'recursion' / 'strange loops' business is mysterious, present at the heart of all interesting systems it must be pretty special, it must require magic or

So, it's a difficult analogy to make.<p>A better analogy would be like saying that a king has a right to abolish his monarchy.<p>Also, it is only self-defeating if the original goal was only to amass the wealth.<p>To continue the analogy to this point, a king abolishing his monarchy would only be self-defeating if his only goal was to be a king. However, if his goal as king was to make life better for his country, then abolishing his monarchy in favor of a democracy would be a very good move and not self-defeating at all.<p>Likewise, if the person's original goal was to produce and then dispose of the rewards as he wished, then doing so is not self-defeating. It's only self-defeating if his original goal was to simply have wealth.<p><edit>
The other part of Rand's argument is that the individual has the right to dispose of their wealth however they please, because they produced it and they own it. A democracy would only have a right to dispose of itself provided it was the democracy that created itself in the first place.

With that experience in mind I can verify you sister's friend's claim.<p>When you come right down to it there are two things you have to realize about women.<p>1.  As hard as it is for Men to comprehend the truth is attractiveness isn't that high on a woman's list.  It's not that women don't like an attractive man it's just lower on the list.  Here's an example I use to explain it to men.  I, as someone who dated a lot of theatre women, like dating professional dancers (for reasons I won't be so crass as to spell out here).  But I'll certainly be interested in a beautiful, smart, funny woman who isn't a dancer.  Attractiveness to women is like being a dancer to me.  It's a plus but not a deal breaker.  Hence ""average looking bald guy"" isn't necessarily a deterrent.<p>2.  Attracting women in general boils down to one simple concept: Stand out from the crowd in a good way.  No women wants a guy that seems average to her.  So when your sister's gay friend shows a lack of interest in a woman every other man drools over it makes that woman wonder why and gives the guy a sense of mystery to him.

She is saying that if you are capable of achieving wealth, then you will achieve it no matter where you start from in our society. She also explains that those who are capable of achieving are concerned only with their own achievements and awards, and those of others only so far as they help to achieve their own.<p>If you put all of this together, you end up with the person of achievement not caring where others started (or what they inherited) in relation to themselves. Fairness only holds value when the person getting shafted cares enough to give it value.<p>Besides, Rand's argument is that over the long run, it really doesn't matter, as the person who is capable of producing great wealth will do so, with or without an inheritance. The person who is not will quickly squander it all and end up right back where they started. Her point is simply that an inheritance does not change one's ability to produce.",1252074180

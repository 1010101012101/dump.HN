2640851,comment,2640685,2640685,1,0,Shenglong,,,"They strongly emphasize that ""usually"" you cannot focus on price and quality at the same time, in business school. When analyzing different aspects of a business, you usually sacrifice one for the other. Not positioning your product to be the cheapest alternative is also emphasized, because to the majority of people, it does give the illusion of a subpar product.<p>The <i>actual price</i> doesn't matter - it's all about how it's positioned relative to your competitors. Very smart companies will price low with a completely different pricing model, that makes customers feel like they're getting a better price, not because it's cheap, but because of the unique way their own business is structured.",1307714278

At least I've never randomly received feedback from my music website.  I got a record label to carry a track once, sold as MP3 for a low price, and all of a sudden the track hits some top-10s, etc.  People pay more attention when you attach a price tag.<p>In all honesty, I actually think this would be a good approach for open-source software funding: open the source, but package it up nicely and sell binaries.  I suspect that people would buy, even if someone else comes along with their own binary; include a trademark clause perhaps to stop them from naming it the same thing.",1307713971

However there are 100 billion neurons in the brain, and are connected in very complicated ways.<p>Since there's evidence that cranking up the seratonin for _every_ neuron or suppressing the dopamine for _every_ neuron isn't healthy, it stands to reason that treating ""mental illness"" is more complicated than turning a water faucet on or off. Who knows exactly what causes it? It could be related to patterns of connection, i.e. neuron A is better off connected to neuron B at site C, but is connected strongly to neuron D at site E. And then comes the question of whether the neuron is sending weird patterns of action potentials. Or it could be the timing, speed or synchronization compared to other neurons is off. Or it could be poor overall health of each individual neuron. Or subtle brain damage. And the problem might be localized to just some neurons in one part of the brain, and not another, making treatment of the whole brain with drugs a messy approach. You see, there are no obvious answers right now, but there are plenty of alternate explanations besides global chemical imbalance. :)<p>EDIT: Also, you could think of mental illness as being psychological, and something that the brain can heal on its own, given the right environment.",1307712535

We basically don't have travel agents any more.  Decades ago it was a career.  Today it's a minor niche.  Does that mean that in 1980, travel agents were unproductive dead weight?  Certainly not.<p>Technology advances and a big financial shakedown have given us the one-two punch, and I'm not sure we'll ever quite get back to where we were just a few years ago.<p>I was listening to Rush Limbaugh the other day bitch about the May US 'job creation' figures - only 50k or so.   He was bitching that he knows how to ""get this country right again"".  It boiled down to ""lower taxes on corporations, and reduce regulations"".<p>1. I know plenty of small businesses, and I don't know anyone who's thinking ""dang, if only taxes were lower, I'd go right out and hire a bunch of people"".  Generally, they're just nervous about the short term economy, and would prefer some cash on hand if taxes were reduced.<p>2.  Sure, I'm for lower regulations.  It seems like it might help the guy in the article if there were fewer safety regulations that didn't require $7k in training per employee.  Fair enough.  But I don't see this as something that's preventing people from hiring as much as not being able to find qualified workers, or being willing to invest in the training for those workers.  Many are trapped by underwater mortgages, so more employers are forced to deal with the workforce immediately surrounding them.<p>More on Rush for a moment.  Yes, capitalism is great, etc.  But with the changes in tech we've been seeing the past couple decades, 'successful' companies require fewer people.<p>I'm going out on a limb here and will say that a company's market cap is an indicator of the value they provide the market.  Ford's market cap is $54B, and they employ 164,000.  Apple's market cap is $300B, and they employ 49,000.  Google is $166B and they employ 26,000.  Value created and delivered is far greater, and as more companies ""tech up"", lowered taxes and regulations will just not be a path to higher employment.<p>Yes, the economy may get ""back on track"", but fewer people will be riding those rails.",1307711776

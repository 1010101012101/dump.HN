Mostly what I see is anecdote, which I consider worthless because NYC people and especially NYC finance people are full of shit about how much they make. It's the culture. Furthermore, to the extent that finance is well compensated it's hazard pay. Lots of burnout and layoffs. Also, unreasonable hours.<p>I personally know an engineer in suburban philadelphia who works for a firm that does elevator retrofit consulting for older buildings. He's worth tens of millions. I have met a very rich guy who built up two plants that produce pasta. I indirectly know a very wealthy guy who flies around the world consulting on expanding sewage treatment plant capacity. I also had a wealthy old guy neighbor who just ran four car washes very well for many years.<p>I have yet to personally meet a very wealthy person who made the money in ""finance"". I also don't live in NYC, so take my estimations with a grain of salt.<p>The evidence that I can personally trust indicates to me the low risk, high probability way to get a lot of money is with niche industry expertise and risked capital. I also think there's a ""where there's muck there's brass"" thing going on where real physical businesses like climbing in elevator shafts, sewage plant pools, and grain towers are under-competed.

3278437,comment,3277661,3277824,2,0,runningdogx,,,"Could google vary the crawling rate on each site and see what effects that has on response times, and develop an algorithm to adjust crawl speed so as not to affect site performance too much?  If google starts crawling a site and notices sequential crawl requests are answered in .5s w/ .1s stddev and it starts crawling with 10 parallel connections and the answers are 2s w/ 1s stddev, clearly that's a problem because user experience for real people will be impacted.  Maybe google could automatically email webmaster@ and notify them of performance issues it sees when crawling.<p>Another thing that might help google is for them to announce and support some meta tag that would allow site owners (or web app devs) to declare how likely a page is to change in the future.  Google could store that with the page metadata and when crawling a site for updates, particularly when rate limited via webmaster tools, it could first crawl those pages most likely to have changed.  Forum/discussion sites could add the meta tags to older threads (particularly once they're no longer open for comments) announcing to google that those thread pages are unlikely to change in the future.  For sites with lots of old threads (or lots of pages generated from data stored in a DB and not all of which can be cached), that sort of feature would help the site during google crawls and would help google keep more recent pages up to date without crawling entire sites.",1322260618

However, for ""real"" programmers (I kid) there is a lot more to programming languages than the theory.<p>A programming language is not just a means to formulate instructions for a computer to execute. It is also a way for programmers to communicate with each other and, taken further, a way for customer desires to translate into computer actions. I would agree that, viewed as instructions for a computer, not much new has come about in the last 10-15 years.<p>What has developed more recently are all the new ways that programmers are discovering or creating to communicate via code. TDD/BDD/RDD, literate programming, module systems baked into the language, optional typing, parameterized types, etc. are all features that, while not necessarily entirely new from a theory standpoint, are creating new ways for programmers to signal intent.<p>A good example of this at work is the recent resurgence in functional languages. These have, literally, been around since the very first programming languages were created, but they have never really ""caught on"" (for some value of ""caught on""). I would suspect that part of the problem is that it has traditionally been more than a little difficult for someone not used to functional programming to approach the code. So, I would argue that the most important recent advances in the FP space have less to do with type inference, lazy evaluation, or correctness provability, and more to do with clearly communicating intent.",1322260520

Likewise, the employee can leave at any time.</i><p>You're mixing things up. Ethically speaking, if the company winds up having _cause_ to fire them later, that's a separate matter, and there's no ethic quandary.<p>Likewise, if the employee makes an effort to work there and decides to leave, there is no ethical issue.<p>If a company must engage in layoffs, a responsible company incorporates a severance as a means compensating the employee for the failure of the company to hold to their end of the bargain due to unforeseen circumstances or failure.<p>> <i>If you accept the offer and then renege you've actually fulfilled your contractual obligation. If the company wants more than that, they need to pay for it.</i><p>One shouldn't have to pay for people to do what they say they'll do: if they accept the offer, barring some act of god, they should start work for the company.<p>You bring up mortgages as an example -- it's a poor one. In buying a house, you're stating the intention to pay for it. Ethically, you're on the hook -- if you fail to make payments, someone else will be left holding the bag.<p>The contract is merely a legal (not ethical) enforcement mechanism by which the bank may attempt to recoup their loss, in a country where we (rightly) have the 13th amendment that forbids slavery and/or debtors prisons.<p>> <i>From a purely ethical (and completely irrelevant) point of view I see this as holding banks accountable for shady lending practices. After all, it was banks and the lack of due diligence in lending practices that led to this situation.</i><p>The bank is ethically culpable for shady lending practices, but _so are the people who accepted shady mortgages_.<p>What's more, is that those people drove up housing prices and made it that much harder for responsible buyers to own a home.",1322260343

You have a bunch of obviously repetitive pieces. If each tile is 16x16, and there are 256x256 tiles on a map, then one could say that there are 16 million pixels in the world, on a computer that had only 1Mb of memory.<p>So that right there is your clue that this guy is a fraud. 42 trillion voxels? Are they 42 trillion unique voxels, or are they tiled? [1] Right. (a ""voxel"" is the 3d equivalent of a 2D pixel).<p>The thing about tiling is it doesn't just apply to pixels or voxels. Tiling is just a spatial subdivision algorithm that splits space up in to 2d or 3d grids. You can store a color in each grid cell, and then its a voxel. But you can just as easily store the head of a linked list of polygons. And you can also store a pointer to another tile array, and that tile array can then store voxels, or polygons, or more tile arrays. When you do this, its a hierarchical data structure.<p>Do games/graphics programmers know all about this? Yes. Do we use hierarchical composition? Yes! All the time! Do we use axis-aligned hierarchies? Yes, e.g. octrees? Do we use regular grid composition all the way down? Fuck no. Why not? Because splitting up space along predetermined, regular, axis-aligned divisions is fucking awful for modeling interesting 3D worlds [3]. What you get is a brick world: [2]. Such rigid, regular, axis aligned hierarchy fits the real world poorly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://media1.gameinformer.com/imagefeed/featured/gameinformer/infdetail/infill2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media1.gameinformer.com/imagefeed/featured/gameinform...</a>

It's like having EXPLAIN QUERY stack traces on NewRelic.  You don't need a deep trace of every transaction; you need a deep trace from a few representative squeaky wheels, and you use that information to improve the underlying self-serve process.  This is something Google, with their ""1/3 of the company parses logs"", excels at.<p>You'll note neither Matt nor Pierre offered to do anything special for PG. They didn't say ""Oh! I love HN, and we want it to succeed; I'll go push out a manual override that makes sure we use only the one crawler you unblocked.""  They gave him exactly the info he'd get from Webmaster Tools plus general knowledge, and told him how to use Webmaster Tools to fix it.  Maybe they'll go figure out how to implement that ""you're blocked!"" hover-over in SERPs, but again, that would benefit everyone, not just HN.  There's no special treatment here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.wordtothewise.com/2008/04/troubleshooting-a-postini-block/#comment-865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wordtothewise.com/2008/04/troubleshooting-a-post...</a>",1322258549

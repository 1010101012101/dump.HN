Arguments for this include giving an object the ability to ensure some kind of contract is maintained, which becomes impossible if you can arbitrarily change certain values without making sure that other values are also updated appropriately.

218918,comment,218327,218467,0,0,gunderson,,,"Consider <i>any</i> bandwidth user who doesn't use p2p software:  Suppose they download 3 movies per night from iTunes.  On my connection movies take about 10 minutes each to download.  That's 30 minutes of 100% capacity out of each 24 hour day. Add in a fraction more for email, IM, web surfing, etc.<p>Now compare this to a P2P user who utilizes 100% of upstram and 100% of downstream bandwidth capacity 24/7.<p>It is a massive, massive difference.  You can organize the ""typical"" vs ""p2p"" users a variety of ways, but even the most intense consumer of internet video barely scratches the surface.<p>ISPs are simply in the business of repackaging bandwidth.  They buy bandwidth in bulk (which is typically symmetric for upstream and downstream, and they repackage it as residential bandwidth having much more downstream bandwith and just enough upstream to not inhibit downstream traffic.<p>They also buy bandwidth that requires super-expensive dedicated hardware and repackage it so that a $50 cable modem can provide a ""reliable enough"" connection in a consumer's home.<p>The reason bandwidth costs about $60/month for a 16 megabit connection (the price I pay currently) is because there are a lot of assumptions made about what constitutes 'typical' residential use.  Part of the profit model of an ISP comes from bandwidth speculation.  Just as a commodity speculator may buy pork belly futures from a farmer in expectation of future actual hogs, ISPs buy large amounts of bandwidth from major backbone providers with the expectation of being able to resell it as residential bandwith.  The assumption on which all of this is based is a typical residential user's actual usage pattern.<p>ISPs have found that residential users prefer high peak download speed over anything else, so they package and price accordingly.<p>All that would happen if P2P use increases is that ISPs would be <i>forced</i> to increase bandwidth prices on everyone in order to remain profitable.  So in effect, net neutrality will force everyone who doesn't use their <i>residential</i> connection in an atypical way to subsidize those who do.<p>You are correct that an ISP could redirect all DNS bounces or worse, but it is unlikely that such things would get out of control due to competition from other firms.  If there is insufficient competition, that is an antitrust issue, it has nothing to do with ""net neutrality"".<p>Net neutrality is simply one interest group trying to get the government to meddle with the pricing scheme that has been voluntarily created by one firm and is preferred and accepted by the vast majority of consumers.",1213640704

218916,comment,218624,218644,0,0,qaexl,,,"If you look around, you'll see some interesting things.<p>When I go to Arby's, I sometimes read who actually owns their registered trademarks. It reads something like ""Arby's Intellectual Properties, LLC"" (don't quote me on that, but it is an LLC).<p>My apartment complex is fairly sizeable. Before it was sold off to the current owners, the property itself was owned by an LLP and the property management arm is an Delware LLC. This is a national property management firm.<p>The last time I was out on the road and stopped at a truck stop -- Pilot -- I noticed that Pilot was owned and operated as an LLC.<p>In Columbus, OH, there was a stadium built maybe eight years ago, called the Nationwide Arena. Nationwide Insurance may have sponsored it, but the stadium itself is held in an LLC.<p>My point in this is that there isn't really a stigma attached to an LLC. And looking at it in a different way, an S-Corp and an LLC are two different investment vehicles for any future investors you might be looking for. From those above examples, you might see that LLCs are often used when it comes to holding assets. And as for an S-corp, you can always convert it to a C-corp later on; and depending on the size and how much isolation you want to protect the business assets, you'll end up with multiple entities anyways.<p>Money used to setup the corp can be reimbursed by a board meeting to the incorporator (either with the LLC or the S-Corp) and declared as ""capital expenses"". It has to be documented; in the case of the S-corp, it should be documented in the initial board meeting and recorded in the minutes. The money you reimburse to the incorporator is paid back in a lump sum, but the capital expense itself is amortized and carried on the books for X number of months (for which, I don't remember value X off the top of my head).<p>But yeah, it would be private money. So you'll want to figure that into your calculation when you setup how much you're going to capitalize the company at.<p>With a Corp, you take additional capital by selling more shares. If you don't have any more shares to sell, you will have to amend the articles of incorporation to authorize more shares, and you generally have to file the amendment with the state government. If you have some shares left, the company can sell them to the investor. Often, there are buy-sell agreements in place, to protect the current shareholders from suddenly getting a shareholder they don't want (massively scaled up, it is like the hostile takeover attempted by EA with TTWO, or with the whole Ichan/Yahoo/Microsoft).<p>LLCs sell additional membership interests, and how you account for that depends on how the operating agreement (read: software configuration) is setup. Some LLCs express ownership in terms of percentages; some express ownership in terms of numbered shares (just like a Corp). How you determine how it is expressed is explicitly spelled out in the operating agreement. The buy-sell agreement you find in a corp is often folded into the operating agreement (example: member may not sell their shares without the unanimous approval of all the current members of the LLC).<p>There are tons more stuff. Definitely look into the Nolo books. The publisher was started by a lawyer, the books are generally comprehensible. They lay out for you a number of different options you might have so that when you walk into a lawyer's office, you can make informed choices. And just like configuring software, it isn't necessary to enable all the options -- some might even be security risks -- it depends on what you are trying to achieve.",1213640643

I've worked at 4 different companies, and always show up wearing professional, clean clothes to my interview (suit and tie the first time, since then just button down shirts and dress pants or khakis).<p>The t-shirt and jeans can wait until you've proven yourself for a few months.  I go to work now in shorts and a t-shirt, so this isn't some sour grapes rant.

It takes about 5-10 minutes on my connection to download a movie.  A typical movie lasts 1-2 hours.  So assume there are 5 people in a ""household"" using an internet connection, each of whom spends the entire day watching movies.  That's 15 movies per day per person, which is 75 movies.  Assume 10 minutes per download and you have 750 minutes of 100% bandwidth usage, which comes out to 12 hours, or half the day.<p>This means that under this extreme scenario for internet video usage, the connection is only utilized at 50% of downstream bandwidth in a 24 hour period.<p>With p2p software, it's typical for 100% of the upstream and downstream bandwidth to be used all of the time.<p>Typical usage (which is what the cable companies look at to determine how much to charge) is much less, which is why the price is around $60/month for 16 megabits/second of download speed.<p>A 100% usage 16 megabit broadband connection costs significantly more than this.  Even a T1 which offers far less bandwidth costs at least $250 in most markets.<p>My point is that there is not an issue here of excessive market power, it's simply that residential broadband is priced based on a workable usage pattern, and people who leave their p2p software running 24/7 make the model that works for everyone else stop working.<p>I'm not opposed to p2p, but I think it is reasonable for ISPs to charge extra to to those who need more than what the $60/month connection is intended for.<p>It's not monopoly pricing power, the service simply can't be offered profitably if someone is using 100% of the bandwidth.  I've paid about the same for bandwidth since I first got broadband in 2000.  I went from having 256K to having 16 megabits.

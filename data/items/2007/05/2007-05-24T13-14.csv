Moreover, advertisers would get feedback on their ads.",1180014966

24331,comment,24325,24325,0,0,amichail,,,"IMO, human computation is a field with enormous potential.  But strangely, there are few publications on the topic.  It's not taken seriously in computer science yet.  <p>Or maybe it requires a different sort of thinking than what most computer scientists are accustomed to?<p>Or perhaps most computer scientists feel that human computation is cheating?  For them, maybe there is no reward in this sort of research.  They are more interested in something technically difficult, even if the results are much worse.",1180014581

As I imply in the second paragraph and explain in the edit you do get a warning BUT unless you then pull out your paper copy of the fingerprint and manually compare the fingerprint of the certificate with the one you have on file you do not know that your connection is secure.  When is the last time anyone took that step?  We need CAs to automate this process for us.",1180013935

24324,comment,24282,24291,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Absolutely.<p>It now makes sense when Zuckerberg turned down Yahoo, saying that he thinks they can do it better. It's probably showing that facebook will be trying to prove that, whatever can be done off their userbase, they will prove that they can do it better. They have enough leverage to do anything that's social network related, and they are guaranteed that their userbase will be computer-literate enough (because those who aren't, know someone who is, just across the hall) to adapt to any new features.<p>Launching your business straight off of facebook's API is nothing but stupid. Fine, not stupid, but a risk that without a miracle, tremendously outweighs the benefits. You basically expose yourself as the guniea pig. Clear the minefield for your opposition to trot through. And functionally, it looks like you tap into a ready-made, enormous free pool of users, but financially (in the per user aspect), you have zero users.<p>Looking at the landscape it shouldn't be hard to predict what kinds of services they will be adding, at least in the next 6 months or so. A questions service is probably the next low-hanging fruit. By now, answeru.com should be worried, like, hell worried.<p>FB's API is probably good for data mining. Other than that I don't know what.",1180012671

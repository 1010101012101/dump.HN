As an example, LMDB (smaller, key-value DB) in its initial docs and slides bragged 30K of object size. Build current version, you&#x27;ll get 60K, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be config options to just make it smaller. So either use older version, which is of course scary (who knows how many bugs was fixed later), or spend quite a lot of time tearing it apart, with unclear maintenance perspectives. Having something ROM and RAM optimized from the beginning seems like pretty good solution (if someone grew brave to do it).",1448384398

Airlines from countries with currencies that aren&#x27;t always easily convertible, such as airlines from the developing world, probably have to keep substantial reserves in currencies their customers tend to use, to ensure that they can always carry out transactions in that currency. If you buy your ticket in the native currency, then you&#x27;ve not required them to dig into that reserve, which is a win for them.<p>Conversely, this is probably not a win for the original questioner, because they probably paid a fee for currency conversion to their bank, which was probably larger than that paid by the airline, because the airline has more market leverage with which to set pricing contracts for currency conversion.",1448384180

When it comes to something you want to use as a core foundation on which to build (whether you are building software, general business, academic work etc.) I completely understand how this is very likely to lead to you being exploited. This applies for example to an operating system, or a programming platform (JVM, .NET, etc.). But there are plenty of places where you can use closed source software that don&#x27;t put you in such a disadvantageous position.<p>One example is non-required tooling like an IDE. If Jetbrains goes Dr. Evil on everyone tomorrow (though I guess some would argue their recent pricing model changes have done that), there is still Eclipse and plenty of room for someone else to break into that space. Changing IDEs isn&#x27;t nothing, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;d have to rewrite my code.<p>Another is various general XaaS offerings. If Heroku (or more likely Salesforce) goes off the deep end tomorrow, worst case is that I have to administer some servers myself. Again, I don&#x27;t lose anything that I would have had before anyway.<p>The current trend is already building everything on top of open source infrastructure. Even the JVM and .NET are open source now, as are most other pieces of the development puzzle (Databases, libraries of all shapes and sizes, etc.). In fact, I don&#x27;t think even a big player like Microsoft would have much luck trying to get people to invest in another closed source platform. So if we walk this line between open and closed software, what do we lose by using some <i>replaceable</i> closed source tools or services?

At this point my title then changed to Analyst.<p>After that journey I decided to switch roles within the same company and move to Florida where I was given the title of Applications Engineer. I worked on a Care Management system for remote nurses going in-home to at-risk members. This system was horrid and looked like Windows 98 ... so I asked if I could re-build it with a JavaScript/Bootstrap front-end and re-wire a bit of the backend with the other 6 engineers on the team. My request was granted and I was tasked to other projects to beautify and re-engineer.<p>Now I&#x27;m a Systems Analyst for a Oracle-owned Talent Management System with the same company (7 years) ... pretty much doing configuration, answering questions and consulting.<p>So...

Others notice that the market economy is designed around people being selfish, so they use it to justify defecting - minding only their own short-term interest.<p>As for ethics of this topic, I think the quoted government response about one such case is spot on - this is people acting in bad faith.

Both of them introduce waste - the more people do that, the more often a plane flies with seats empty, wasting fuel that could otherwise provide utility by carrying other passengers. And speaking of other passengers, this is another thing to consider - if you use a travel &quot;hack&quot; that leaves an airplane with an empty seat, you&#x27;re taking away the seat from another traveler, who could have used it. Or, given the discriminatory pricing, who could have paid less for it. So by using those kinds of tricks, people are not only hurting the airline, they&#x27;re also hurting each other.",1448382823

Users are often powerless in fixing the software they bought, or the services they subscribed for, with the cost of switching to something else being often very significant. Users are also often uneducated or ignorant in what the software does, not realizing the long term consequences of their interactions with software.<p>And because users are often powerless or uneducated or ignorant, software developers feel empowered to move the boundaries, preferring to ask for forgiveness than for permission as they say, with current casualties being the loss of privacy and even the loss of freedom of speech. And then it isn&#x27;t a wonder that intelligence agencies get a free pass to spy on everybody&#x27;s communications, I mean if the software makers and the service providers are doing it themselves, the government would be stupid to not be a part of it, given that we&#x27;ve made it so easy.<p>I&#x27;ve always disagreed with Richard Stallman&#x27;s stance on Free versus Nonfree software, preferring Open-Source instead and being relaxed about developing and using nonfree software. I&#x27;ve always said to myself that many companies are doing a good job and software developers have to eat, including myself. But some of FSF&#x27;s arguments hold very true and it makes me wonder.

If you have a functional interface which doesn&#x27;t cause side effects, (i.e. state changes of any kind, external actions that can&#x27;t really be effectively verified by test code, etc) then unit testing is very valuable and useful given you <i>just test the interface</i> using the simplest possible approach: a table of some inputs which should map to some outputs.<p>I&#x27;d go further and say you should always write the tests only after this interface has solidified. Test first makes sense only under either the assumption that your first design is always the best design, or that you are happy to spend the time to morph the tests, as well as the code when you realise your first design wasn&#x27;t the best and have to iterate and tweak.<p>We all know from experience that the first assumption is never true. As for the second assumption, it may be true, but then the question becomes, well, why waste the time? You know those &#x27;test-first&#x27; tests will just be rewritten anyway.

Some degree 2 sentences can be easy, and some degree 1 sentences can be hard (e.g. &quot;the horse [raced past the barn] fell&quot;, which has only 1 level of embedding).<p>So if you want to describe English with the rule &quot;no embedding beyond 1 level&quot; then you&#x27;re going to miss a lot of valid sentences while also failing to rule out lots of invalid ones.<p>Contrast this with a valid descriptive rule of English, such as &quot;determiners such as &#x27;the&#x27; always come before the nouns they modify&quot;. I can say &quot;the man died&quot;, but &quot;man the died&quot; is never comprehensible under any circumstances and cannot be made better.<p>No one would say that a sentence with 10 levels of embedding is perfectly fine English. But descriptively, you have the problem that there is no <i>non-arbitrary</i> upper bound on embedding degree: it&#x27;s not clear when one more level of embedding takes you from grammatical to ungrammatical, and furthermore it depends on the contents of the embedded clauses.<p>There is also some work I&#x27;m aware of, currently in prep for publication, showing that the extent to which people can understand multiply-embedded sentences strongly correlates with IQ (measured by Raven&#x27;s matrices).<p>All this suggests that the simplest descriptive rule is to say that English allows center-embedding recursively, but that there are human processing limitations on sentences that create very deep stacks.

It seems that they simply replaced PhantomJS with jsdom, but in the process they lost Karma, which means that they can&#x27;t run their test suite on other browsers.<p>Also, from first glance, I&#x27;m unable to see a performance improvement by not using Karma. It may be because they&#x27;re using more tests in Mocha, but the difference isn&#x27;t huge considering they&#x27;re losing a lot of functionality.",1448380909

We get about ten to fifteen children&#x27;s books a week from the library and I&#x27;m utterly amazed that most have been published.  The ones that are part of a more common series are usually much better.  The llama llama mad at mama sort of books.  Dr Suess definitely falls into this higher quality bracket.  Many times I have wondered if they spend more time writing the about author section then they do the book.  I see this as a market that could use some serious improvement.",1448380896

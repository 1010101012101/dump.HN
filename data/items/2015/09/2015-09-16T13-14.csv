No its not Euro-style universal healthcare, but this idea that they&#x27;ll starve in the streets if they lose their jobs is ridiculous. That&#x27;s on top of COBRA, which allow you to stay on your employers plan for a bit while you work out a new provider. Or subsidized ACA exchange insurance. We are down to 11% uninsured right now. In the 90s we were getting close to hitting 20%.<p>There&#x27;s a lag period before you can apply for and get benefits, but that&#x27;s what unemployment insurance (which is mandatory) is for and you know... your own savings. You are putting away savings right?<p>The real problem here is that I find most middle-class people have no idea how welfare works. None. They&#x27;ve never had to apply for these things. They just think they&#x27;re for &quot;welfare queens&quot; and &quot;drug addicts.&quot; They don&#x27;t realize that these programs are pretty much everywhere in the USA.  For example, food stamps are mostly used by white people.  So these people have unrealistic ideas of what loss of income means. They think they&#x27;re going to debtors prison and being forced to die in their basements from lack of healthcare. Europeans like yourself buy into this nonsense because they have an anti-US bone to pick. The reality is that you&#x27;re both being incredibly disingenuous.

10226544,comment,10224026,10226363,0,0,pron,,,"> Immigration plus no welfare state was vastly better than the alternative of starving in ireland. It&#x27;s also vastly better than being beheaded by ISIS or being paid 200rs/day in India.<p>Sure, but so does immigration <i>with</i> a welfare state. What does the welfare state have to do with that? If you&#x27;d say that the welfare state increases the cost of accepting immigrants, that may be true, but people living in a welfare state are usually willing to pay that price for what they believe is a more pleasant society. I don&#x27;t think free-market people are any more willing to accept immigrants for their own free-market reasons (e.g. they&#x27;re willing to settle for less so they lower the wages overall, and most people are employees rather than employers).<p>> I&#x27;m also confused by the collective responsibility you seem to allude to. How do you determine which groups this responsibility adheres to? Can &quot;the Jews&quot; rather than &quot;Europe&quot; also be collectively responsible for things?<p>That&#x27;s a very good question that is the subject of much debate in ethics. But the first thing to note that in this case there is no <i>legal</i> responsibility or any sort of coercion, so the philosophical burden is lifted a bit. If there&#x27;s no <i>obligation</i> we can resolve the matter with a simple <i>feeling</i>. If you <i>feel</i> responsible -- act; if not -- don&#x27;t.<p>But if we were to discuss the matter more on principle, then you can try to answer the question in general (see [1]), but I prefer a more pragmatic approach if &quot;philosophical shortcuts&quot; can be made, and I believe that in this case they can be made, due to these two (particular) factors:<p>1. The cost of the action is collective (i.e. tax money). While it may affect individuals personally (those harmed by increased crime), that is not any more so than any collective action, like zoning, taxation etc. (contrast that with collective responsibility of the kind that exacts a direct personal price like bombing civilians).<p>2. The benefit from the harm inflicted is still felt. Most Europeans today benefit (personally, though perhaps indirectly) from their respective countries having looted the rest of the world.<p>(also, of course, unlike with &quot;the Jews&quot;, there really was collective action involved in subjugating the rest of the world)<p>The extenuating circumstances in this case -- namely that European states were not democracies at the time most of the meddling took place is offset, IMO, by point 2, which makes everything easier. If you possess stolen property that you inherited, you still have to return yet (that&#x27;s a big generalization and there can be special circumstances, but as a general rule, this is a <i>relatively</i> easy moral call).<p>So I think that in this particular case, these two factors make it easy to assign collective responsibility, even without resolving the question of collective responsibility in general. BTW, My personal view is that collective responsibility can only exist in particular cases that are very dependent on circumstance. It is certainly more rare than personal responsibility, but it exists because much of human endeavor is done as groups that are more than just a sum of individuals (as we know that group dynamics is a very different beast from personal dynamics). If you reject the notion of collective responsibility in <i>all</i> circumstances, you exclude a large part of human action from moral judgement (I don&#x27;t believe ethics is by any means an absolute, but as a human construct it is meant to apply to most human actions).<p>It is interesting to note that even the Bible, which normally places a strong emphasis on personal responsibility, certainly acknowledges cases of collective responsibility (and sometimes punishment).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/</a>",1442411448

I was in some fairly &quot;bonehead&quot; computer class and we often worked on simple projects and saved them to floppy disks to take home or work on later.<p>At the time, the family computer was still an aging Commodore 128 but I was working mostly in DOS at school so I&#x27;d bring home my disks and work on projects on my dad&#x27;s work laptop.  Dad&#x27;s work laptop included a primitive virus scanner so of course I scanned the disk I&#x27;d been using on the school network.  The scanner finds some minor virus and cleans it up (in retrospect, I guess it could&#x27;ve easily just been a false positive but who knows).<p>After taking the disk back to school and working on projects again, I scanned it at home the following evening.  Virus once again detected.  So the next day in class I mention to the teacher that there&#x27;s probably some innocuous virus on the classroom network and offered to help get rid of it.  I was interested in that stuff even if I was still mostly a novice.<p>But instead of giving me a new project, the teacher flipped out.  She accused me of trying to start a panic and disrupting class and sent me to see the ass. principal.  Now, this dude hated kids (especially the ones who clearly had no respect for authoritah).  I had to sit in his office without speaking while he held a (no joke) half hour conversation on the phone with his friend about some fishing trip they had planned for the weekend.  Afterward he reamed me out and basically told me I was full of shit because the teacher wouldn&#x27;t lie about such things.<p>In the end, it was my first lesson in &quot;people who don&#x27;t get computers or trust them will often avoid dealing with issues that make them uncomfortable and possibly view you with hostility for suggesting otherwise.&quot;",1442411441

Also from a marketing standpoint her &quot;$100K&quot; of services was donated by a gracious company to the poor, they sure as heck don&#x27;t publicize the actual cost of providing that service was only $10K even including minor surgery and recuperation.  They did a good job, by the time I met her, I had no idea her arm had been so ruined just a year or two ago until she told me and showed me her arm, by no means did they cheap out on her care or recovery just because she was uninsured.<p>Finally the hope is that if they charged that poor girl a fair $10K then it would be hanging over her head for years until she could pay it off or more likely bankruptcy filing fees costing less than $10K they&#x27;d get nothing at all, but if they &quot;charge&quot; $100K then they might jackpot and she could qualify for some govt grant or fundraiser or whatever.  If they know she&#x27;s going to declare bankruptcy no matter what they charge and they&#x27;re going to get $0 revenue, then game theory shows they should ask for $100M on the off chance by a miracle she wins the lottery, or qualifies from some weird govt grant or school support fund or something.<p>I think something foreigners often don&#x27;t understand is we charge poor people $100K for a broken arm but we only charge them like $2K to file bankruptcy, so there are no acute medical problems that cost more than $2K, and for chronic problems they make life hell until either the chronic problem goes away and so do the bankruptcy bills, or the victim dies, but its not really expensive.  The business model ruins middle class aspirations (how will I have the vacation home and RV if I file bankruptcy?) but we solved that problem by shipping off all the middle clss jobs to China, not having a middle class means not having to worry about a middle class anymore, there&#x27;s just really rich people and peasants who own nothing.",1442410496

If push comes to shove they cannot outright refuse, but they can be highly disinclined.<p>Insurance isn&#x27;t just &quot;we cover your bills&quot;, but &quot;we negotiate rates with providers&quot;. Much healthcare billing is basically funny money. Or more specifically, there are huge fixed costs, but charges are based on specific services billed (HMOs excepted, though internally they likely operate somewhat similarly), so that what in a tremendous number of cases, <i>the healthcare provider cannot tell you, as a private individual, what you&#x27;d be billed for treatment.</i> But some hospital procedure or stay can billed entirely differently depending on <i>who</i> paying, with <i>hugely</i> varying rates.<p>And, since the uninsured has zero effective bargaining leverage (health plans can threaten to drop a provider or apply other leverage), they get the highest rates.<p>On top of all this, billing is tremendously disaggregated. You might see charges for facility, individual supplies, labs, transport, and individual medical personnel who charge independently. Many (if not most) doctors aren&#x27;t <i>employees</i> of a hospital, but are independent service providers who charge separately.<p>It&#x27;s a mess.<p>And a distressingly ineffective one. There&#x27;s been very little real improvement in health outcomes since the 1950s (and for quite some time they got <i>worse</i>). Much of the improvement can be chalked up to improved environmental and lifestyle factors (removing lead from paint and gasoline, asbestos, less smoking and drinking). It&#x27;s been improved health outcomes for the poor and minorities which account for much of the life expectancy gains as well. Earlier improvements largely came from public health measures: fresh, clean drinking water, sewerage systems, municipal waste removal, and quarantines for infectious disease.

10226299,comment,10225203,10226143,0,0,TheOtherHobbes,,,"Vinyl is very heavily processed. The sound that ends up on the groove has the bass cut by up to 20dB, and the treble boosted by the same amount, because the needle can&#x27;t move fast enough and far enough to reproduce a flat frequency response. (Google &quot;RIAA curve&quot; for details.)<p>The processing is reversed on playback in the preamp, but there&#x27;s always a mismatch between the source EQ and the preamp EQ, so there&#x27;s always some tonal distortion. And because the bass gets boosted so much there&#x27;s added waveform distortion which increases with bass frequencies and makes the bass thicker.<p>Many turntables also have pitch instabilities.<p>Hence &quot;vinyl sound.&quot;<p>So no - it&#x27;s not even remotely accurate. Add scratches, crackles, and pops, groove deterioration - the needle causes enough friction to melt the plastic in the groove - and other artefacts, and it&#x27;s really more of a lifestyle/collector thing than anything to do with accuracy.<p>Personally I have enough physical stuff already, and I want less, not more.

True tone deafness is something (which most studies agree) only 1-3% of the general population suffer from.<p>If you are truly tone deaf you will be unable to really enjoy or appreciate music. For that reason many people take these tests and declare them &quot;too easy&quot; but if the test is well designed it <i>should</i> be easy for 99% of people.

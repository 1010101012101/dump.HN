How about 400 years? Or 800 years? Where do we draw the line? How old does a country need to be to not offend the rest of the world in trying to keep their resources and infrastructure from being spread too thinly?",1256115443

894261,comment,894182,894182,0,0,anshul,,,"There is nothing really wrong with probability notation.  As inferential steps between concepts increase in math, abuse of notation becomes indispensable.<p>All that probability shorthand can be unambiguously translated to formal definitions quite easily. But doing so would be analogous to writing a complex program in assembly - doable (and defined pretty much by the very fact that this is doable) but not very productive (and thus not worth doing unless you are debugging or something).",1256115135

894254,comment,894182,894182,0,0,ramanujan,,,"Huh. What I was expecting to see here was a critique of the notation for expressing causality (and then expecting to cite Judea Pearl's do notation).<p>But regarding the post...<p>1) Subscripts basically solve the problem of the identical p's.<p>2) For iterated expectations, again, subscripts solve that problem as well.<p>E_X[X^Y]<p>indicates that it's the expectation over X.<p>3) However, for dummy variables it definitely can be annoying to use P(X=x), especially when writing stuff by hand. Your mental dialogue is saying ""x equals x"" and it's often very important to distinguish the variable from the value during manipulation.<p>That's why I tend to use a different letter for the dummy variable -- P(X=k) when X is discrete and either f_X(u) or P(X \in [u-du,u+du]) when X is continuous.",1256114558

894249,comment,893240,893240,0,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"Voting is like innoculation.<p>I do not merely vote for a 'mainstream' candidate to ensure that my choice gets in.  I also vote so that 'extreme' candidates are excluded.  A vote for a mainstream candidate is an innoculation for society against extremist diseases.<p>It is vanishingly unlikely that my vote will be at the exact tipping point, ie a hanging chad county in Florida.  It is also unlikely that my innoculation against killer flu will be the one innocluation that stops the spread of the virus.  But from society's point of view it does not matter - the more who are innoculated, the safer society is.<p>Similarly, the more people who vote the more candidates need to pander to the mainstream opinion, not the extremist.  In general we become safer.<p>This all breaks down if mainstream opinion is actually 'wrong'.  But thats a different issue.<p>PS<p>Here in the UK the fascist BNP have got two MEPs and will be controversially appearing on a wellknown politics talk show.  Innoculations need to be kept up.",1256113802

From what I remember, you can only call the product Firefox if the code matches verbatim; Debian &c. apply custom patches not included in Firefox proper and are therefore obliged to rebrand. If you used the Mozilla builds, are you sure this would apply? Curious here.",1256113785

In fact I would say it's a sign to approach with caution if a startup is wasting money on superficial nonsense like that.<p>However, the designer in me still loves a great card. As print becomes less prevalent I miss the textural experience a screen can't provide such as the feel of paper, emboss, deboss, foil stamps, spot varnishes, die cuts, etc. If you can afford it, I think it's okay to splurge a little here.",1256113713

The problem the author mentioned is solved, since we are now summing over all elements in X rather than using the input variable inappropriately.<p>(2) Given sets of elements X and Y, and the set of ALL elements O, then p(X), p(Y), and p(X|Y) are all computed in the same manner. p(X) is shorthand for p(X|O) -- so we are now given three analogous functions, p(X|O), p(Y|O), and p(X|Y). So,  Bayes' can be used to compute all three in the exact same manner, if you so wish.<p>The above rebuttals are obviously discrete, but there are analogous continuous variable scenarios.",1256113276

The investor / con artist can report any attractive numbers they feel like - who is going to keep them honest?<p>I strongly suspect that investors who change to be pitched are in fact scam artists who do just enough investment to plausibly deny that they are in fact scam artists while taking in huge amounts of cash from ignorant start-ups and forcing the start-ups that do agree to receive investment into contracts that strongly favor the investors.<p>I'm sorry, but charging to pitch fails the common sense test; it is little more than a way of separating fools from their money.",1256112000

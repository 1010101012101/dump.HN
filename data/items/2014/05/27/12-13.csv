They were constraining the sorts of things you could do,” Brown told us in 2012. “Microsoft likes to do a really big up-front design, where they define the physics of a new universe. They birth this new universe, and they say: ‘This is how you do it’–instead of starting out with something simple and letting people show them how it should be done.”<p>I really hope this advice is taken by others, particularly the Windows team. Powershell is a golden example of this. Great idea, piping around objects instead of text, but wait, they must be .NET objects. So the entirety of the language community cannot participate other than Microsoft languages.<p>I&#x27;m hoping they revitalize the command line taking this advice, start with something simple and let others build on top of it.",1401195578

I agree with you that the whole point of jargon is for &#x27;insiders&#x27; to be able to communicate quickly and unambiguously.<p>The point is that it could be sensitive and just isn&#x27;t a nice term to use day to day. I&#x27;ve had moments myself where using the master and slave terms felt a bit... odd. It very well might be that I was the only one feeling a bit awkward, but that itself is a reason to consider using less loaded terms.<p>Second, though I agree that industry terms are valuable, I can&#x27;t think of <i>that</i> many terms that have connotations similar to slavery (but by all means jog my memory!). And even if there are, I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t incrementally change our terminology and phase out anachronistic (and/or loaded) ones.<p>Finally though, I don&#x27;t find this a big issue. I see it as relatively easy to slowly change this term, and I like that, but I don&#x27;t feel like I should actively argue for changing the terms &#x27;master&#x27; and &#x27;slave&#x27;.

So that&#x27;s how you end up with $^V being aliased to a string representation of the version of perl interpreter currently executing.

This is something I hear a lot, and I agree with it to a certain extent, but I purposely left out any mention of GUIs for a few reasons:<p>1. The guide is intended for people who want to take a look &quot;under the hood&quot;. This is really difficult to do through GUIs, which tend to hide all of the implementation details.<p>2. As a child comment mentioned, even if I include GUIs in the guide, I can&#x27;t possibly cover all of them. This just confuses things for people who use GUI X when the guide only talks about GUI Y and Z.<p>3. It&#x27;s much easier to write the guide using CLI examples.

Ditto with the calculation that checks the weight bearing capability of a column or beam in a large building.<p>Bespoke tools will be bought for tasks too complex or important for excel - finite element analysis, problems involving non-linear springs etc.  Some time-consuming, repetitive tasks may also be deemed worthy of more automated tools, but on the whole the engineering industry is very much in the dark ages when it comes to modern software approaches.

If I tell Twitter that I want to link to a web page, they damn well better link me to that web page, and not what it redirects to, because I&#x27;ve asked them to link me to that web page. I could be using the link shorteners for analytics, all sorts. Maybe I&#x27;m targeting different URLs to different users.\nYes, for almost all users removing the shorteners is preferable, but the SEO people would be up in arms.\nThe real thing here is that modern browsers don&#x27;t have problems with links - they don&#x27;t need link shorteners. Twitter adding t.co to every link is unnecessary - they could just have a hyperlink etc.",1401192790

It&#x27;s a valid question.<p>One answer is simply that C# is an awesome language. It is roughly as expressive as Ruby and Python, yet it is usually faster and it has much more powerful tooling (MonoDevelop, Visual Studio), partly enabled by its static typing (which is mostly up to taste, I suspect).<p>Also, .NET is <i>very</i> batteries-included and the open source ecosystem is decent (decent, not good).<p>As an example, I currently run a team that develops a C# backend. We dev on Macs, Linuxes and Windowses, we deploy to Docker containers on Linux hosts, we use Postgres for data and the open source ServiceStack for API bindings. When e.g. one of our Mac devs does a deploy, not a single byte of Microsoft code is touched.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you should do this too. But it&#x27;s a valid option, and you can perfectly well do C# without depending on Microsoft tooling or paying them anything. Of course the future is still very much determined by MS, so we&#x27;re betting that MS doesn&#x27;t kill Mono-for-Linux once they buy Xamarin. But that&#x27;s not very different from Oracle and Java, really. MS made stronger and fairer community promises, if that&#x27;s something.",1401192590

The problem is making the connections stick and regrow. At the moment we can&#x27;t do this with the spinal cord. \nPeripheral nervous system nerves regrow if they are lined up correctly, although the fastest speed they will regrow at is 1mm per day. even if you could get central nervous system nerves to regrow like this you are looking at around 4 years for the average person to regrow the nerve to move their big toe (around 1500mm from base of spine to toe). Then you need to ensure that the sensory nerve roots, which have their nerve bodies in the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal cord, will grow up to the brain and integrate in the brainstem with the ascending &#x27;last leg&#x27; nerves.<p>Other people are talking about glues and other substances that may speed this up (ie instead of requiring a nerve to regrow it could just attach to the other side and start working, like having a set of ethernet cables from the brain and just plugging them into the other side) however they are all just as experimental as the general concept of removing and replacing a head as far as I can tell",1401192403

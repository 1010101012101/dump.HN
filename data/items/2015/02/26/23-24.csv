Browser vendors are seeing extensions as a possible vector for malware (which is true) and the trend seems to be for enforced signing. This gives them control over what extensions they&#x27;ll accept, which also gives them the power to prevent adblocking extensions. It isn&#x27;t happening now but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it does in the future. On the desktop there are ways around this but they are far more involved than they used to be. The situation on mobile devices is worse.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7237725"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7237725</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9061592"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9061592</a><p>Another form is a filtering proxy. Admuncher, AdSubtract, Proxomitron, Proximodo, Privoxy, etc. These were quite popular around the turn of the millenium... The downside is that setting one up to filter SSL correctly is a pain (for the ones that do support it) and now, thanks to Superfish, the general public probably has a fear of all things MITM, user-controlled or otherwise.  On a mobile device it&#x27;s rather difficult to install and manage one, so hosting it remotely is better, but probably most reliable way to block ads there.<p>A HOSTS file is another way. It works for blocking ad-CDNs quite effectively, but otherwise is very coarse-grained (easily defeated by ads hosted on same domains as non-ads.) Easy to use for desktop; will likely need to be done through DHCP/DNS server for mobile.<p>As much as I advocate adblocking, I only do it to the ads that are truly giving me a hard time. Tasteful static images and text-only ads don&#x27;t really bother me at all.

9116307,comment,9115231,9115231,0,0,reissbaker,,,"This is nice for some pretty limited use cases, but the most common use case for multithreading in app-like programs (which is what Worker-based apps presumably service: these are not documents) is removing latency from the UI thread. But as long as only the main thread can touch the UI, and the main thread also can&#x27;t access shared memory, this limits uses of this to scenarios where copying the entire render state from a Worker is reasonably fast — in which case, Workers currently already solve the problem. This proposed implementation of shared memory doesn&#x27;t actually solve one of the big remaining needs for shared memory, which is when it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to copy state between a Worker thread and the UI thread at 60fps.<p>For example, Workers aren&#x27;t particularly useful for games in their current iteration: the overhead of copying the state of the world back to the rendering thread is high. This is exactly the problem that shared memory <i>would</i> solve, were it not limited to Workers. This puts web export (or even primary web-based game authorship) at a significant disadvantage as compared to native apps: native code can share memory, and web-based implementations can&#x27;t. In many cases architectures that are optimal for shared-memory threading are pathological when the rendering thread requires copies, meaning that threading gets thrown out the window for web. Even with asm.js-compiled &quot;near-native&quot; performance on the single core, you can only use 25% of the available CPU if you can&#x27;t use multithreading. A 4x performance hit is the difference between 60fps and 15fps... Or 15fps and ~4fps.<p>The title of the blog post got me pretty excited, but the proposal is fairly disappointing in terms of unlocking better performance for web apps. The use cases here are pretty limited to things like CPU-bound number crunching, and I doubt too many people are running machine learning algorithms in a browser as compared to the number people who&#x27;re using browsers to, y&#x27;know, render UIs. By all means scope the problem down to sharing primitive data in ArrayBuffers — we can build abstractions on top of that! — but limiting it to Worker threads makes it near-useless for most web applications. Workers already solve the use cases for UIs that can tolerate copies between the UI thread and the Worker threads, and this proposal doesn&#x27;t allow us to solve needs for UIs that can&#x27;t.",1424993673

9116190,comment,9113185,9115164,0,0,reubenbond,,,"Task<T>/async is a slightly different beast, effectively its a goroutine+channel which can only return 1 value or throw an exception.<p>A better alternative to channels is Rx (Reactive Extensions) which gives you IObservable<T>. It&#x27;s very simple and powerful. Observables can be composed using Linq, and they&#x27;re monadic (if that matters). I like the first class notion that something can fail or be completed (go has close(), which lets you complete a channel, but there is no notion of errors unless you slap a tuple in there).<p>Rx is available on many platforms (incl JVM, JS).<p>Rx.NET does not yet support back pressure (Rx 3.0 will, whenever Microsoft release that, maybe at //build). There&#x27;s an alternative library from Microsoft called Dataflow, though, and Dataflow does support backpressure as well as a lot of other great features. Dataflow is underused, but its great. Rx & dataflow interoperate very easily (.ToObservable() etc)<p>There are a bunch of videos from Netflix on their use of Rx, which are a good watch if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Edit:\nChannels in Go don&#x27;t compose: I can&#x27;t easily take one channel, mutate the values as they arrive, and create another channel from the mutated values.\nWith Rx, that&#x27;s just `var uppers = keyPresses.Select(key => key.ToUpper())` and now I&#x27;ve got a new stream of data. If keyPresses completes, so does uppers. If it fails, that failure is propagated through uppers. This isn&#x27;t easy in Go.<p>goroutines don&#x27;t have any reasonable kind of monitoring. I can&#x27;t say &quot;this routine has completed/failed&quot;, I have to implement that notion every single time using a WaitGroup or something, and that only handles completion, not failure.<p>I&#x27;m not saying C# is perfect and that go&#x27;s channels/goroutines don&#x27;t have any merit, just that there are some things I wish I could do more easily using them.",1424991711

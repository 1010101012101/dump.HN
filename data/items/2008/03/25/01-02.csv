One counter-example of a software company that has kept growing organically is SAS Institute (now $2+ billion and counting). Don't know anything about their internal culture - they say attrition rate is very low.<p>I would modify the ""grow or die"" to ""adapt or die"" because it is really lack of adaptation that seems to kill, and lack of growth may be a manifestation of lack of adaptation. I am not sure size is actually a benefit or hindrance to adaptation (it may be neither). It is theoretically possible for a small company around in 1985 to have adapted itself successfully through waves of change. But alas the only company I can think of that has come anywhere close to adapting through waves of change is Microsoft (and even it hasn't adapted that well).<p>An example of botched adaptation is the Altavista search engine from Digital. I remember the time it was the most advanced search engine (at a time when Gates didn't think search even mattered). The parent company entirely missed their value.",1206409998

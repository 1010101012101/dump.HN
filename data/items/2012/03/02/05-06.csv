I'm not saying that bootstrappers can target a market and not make money for two years. In fact it's the opposite. It seems that that's the kind of idea that's suited for VC if you can get traction in other ways (signups, engagement etc).<p>To me, the kind of concept that's best fitted for bootstrapping is one that you can build in a few days and make money with right away like a project I did recently called DomainPolish.<p>I guess I should have been more careful about choosing the figures I cited, but I really didn't mean $50 million vs a billion as hard numbers. I was trying to say that as a bootstrapper you can target a smaller market or a smaller problem. That's something that you can't do as a venture funded business.<p>That means that all of the people who get funded early on who might ordinarily target your small problem are off building businesses targeted at HUGE markets. This means less competition for the bootstrapper and a greater chance to capitalize on the market opportunity.<p>I definitely realize how hard it is to do this stuff and I didn't want to make it seem like it's super easy to build a $50 million business.

If something will give you an x% better outcome, it doesn't follow that you should spend about x% of your resources on it.<p>It depends entirely on the opportunity costs, yeah? You should spend time on your name only when you believe that thinking about names for another hour will do more good than coding or talking to customers for another hour.",1330665533

But I don't really buy it.<p>I think it's clearer to see the distinction between an information model and a storage model: The fundamental goal of an information model is to provide a mechanism to convert input information into output information.  But if the model is so degenerate that it just echos back the same data in the same format that was put in (at a different time), then it's probably better to call it a storage model.<p>The relational model is a logic system that lets us use predicate calculus to infer from one set of propositions taken to be true, a second set which is by implication true.  That is, it provides a means to obtain encoded answers in response to encoded questions applied to a body of encoded facts.<p>And a KV store is clearly a storage model.<p>And there are some in-between, such as the CouchDB document store, that can transform one body of information to another, but also pay attention to physical storage issues.",1330664595

If so, how enthusiastic would they be about getting it?""<p>It sounds ridiculous, but I have found it brings a quick dose of reality to ideas that I come up with on a whim that are subject to my own bias. For a grossly simple example, if I were to start a restaurant, there is a safe bet that it COULD be successful because anybody would accept food if it were given away for free, especially if it were of high quality. The rest of the process of building a successful restaurant is fairly complicated, but without a product people would be happy to receive for free, there is no business. The level of enthusiasm the people show for the core product is a good indicator of how much they would pay.<p>Contrast that with a lot of software/internet businesses and that question gets very murky. With a lot of the sites that I start work on I think ""if I offered this product for free, would people be excited to get it?"" and very often I realize my idea, while perhaps creative, just isn't solving a real need.",1330664479

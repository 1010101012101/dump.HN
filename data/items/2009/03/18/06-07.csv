Seems to me that as more and more people find themselves able to literally work from anywhere, this will happen more and more often. Why move to the end of the world to live cheaply, when you can just move to a cheap city within your own country and enjoy the same benefits, but with a similar culture?",1237359579
521319,comment,521082,521082,0,0,triplefox,,,"I vaguely remember using some university's gopher system at a demonstration Internet setup circa 1992-93. That would make me seven or eight years old.<p>The first url I actually remember would probably be liii.com:8000 as that was the host of a Merc MUD I played on(Barren Realms). I have some recollection of playing on it a few times before we got internet access at home. Now they're at <a href=""http://www.barrenrealmsmud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barrenrealmsmud.com/</a> and I haven't visited in probably a decade now. Nice that they're still around.<p>The second early url I remember is crl.com, the dial-up ISP my dad signed up with. We had a shell account on a real Unix box, with a whopping 5mb storage, and we weren't allowed to run SLiRP/TIA so we couldn't emulate a SLIP/PPP connection and use graphical browsers(a sore spot as the Web got increasingly graphical). They moved to business-only services some years later (and we moved on to other ISPs) Now the domain appears to be taken by a drug company. I don't remember what crl stood for, even.<p>A third good one was ftp.wuarchive.wustl.edu. They had a pretty spiffy anonymous ftp in the early 90s. Apparently it is now ""too expensive to push bits to the world.""<p>My predominant memory of the internet before around 1996 was that the Web was only one of several viable systems: email, Usenet, telnet, and ftp were also used by my 8-to-10-year-old self. But as I got older, the Web rapidly took over everything. I was still using dial-up right up until 2003 when I went off to college. And then still used dial-up when home on breaks, until I got a laptop and stole the neighbor's wi-fi. It's funny to think of how much dial-up's user experience grew less tolerable over time.",1237359401

It all sounds good, but is it true?<p>To your points: I didn't talk about the influence of yield rates because at no point during my two years in admissions was a decision ever made on a kid based on whether or not we thought they'd matriculate to our school.  This simply did not happen in my presence, so I didn't speak to it.<p><i>Note</i> This is one of the problems I have with college admissions consultants.  They charge kids an arm and leg to help them get into elite schools, but few if any of them actually ever admitted kids to elite schools.  All they can do is look at the black box, see what goes in, what goes out, and then make educated guesses about why.  That's not good enough for the prices they charge.<p>Unfortunately, most of the folks I know who have worked in admissions are so humbled by the process that they wouldn't think to sell kids on the idea that they could get them into an elite school. I tried it for about 3 weeks during grad school and just couldn't do it.  It was too ridiculous.  The kids that are going to get in are going to get in.  The kids that won't, won't.  I could take a big payday to inform kids that they will or won't be admitted, but no one wants that service. They want you to polish them into a winner, even if it's not the case.<p>So the bad information and the snake-oil salesmen dominate the conversation, folks like these people <a href=""http://ivywise.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ivywise.com</a>",1237359388

521304,comment,520836,521278,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Well, that's not really a fair question. Each kid would get looked at one his own.  The rich kid might make a great impression.  The poor kid might make a great impression.  They would never be set side by side for an either/or.  It just isn't done that way.<p>Also, your assumptions are pretty out there.<p>1.  The odds of a poor kid getting the same quality of education as a rich kid are very, very low, especially if you knew just HOW good of an education rich kids in the U.S. can get.  The most informative part of my two years in admissions was the week I spent visiting elite boarding schools in New England to meet with students thinking about applying.<p>My meals and conversations with the students there were astounding.  Their teachers all had PhDs.  There was not one ugly or overweight kid in any of the schools.  The students were years ahead of where I'd been in math and science coming out of a public high school in the Midwest.  And they aggressively questioned me about every aspect of Princeton's curriculum and admission process.  When I would visit public high schools in the Midwest, the kids rarely, if ever had questions for me.  They had no clue what to even ask me about.  ""Princeton"" was just so completely foreign to them.  Not so for these kids, who all had friends currently studying there.  Many of them had siblings who'd graduated from there already.<p>So this was a real eye-opener.  You can be the best kid in a crappy school, but the fact that you were in a crappy school is going to have an impact in the grand scheme of things.  That's why we'd never compare kids across contexts.  It just made no sense.<p>Similarly, the test scores, grades ""et all"" for the rich kid would probably all be higher.<p>If there was a ""poor kid"" who had incredible credentials AND didn't sound like a basket case, then he'd be hotly pursued by every top school in the country.  But those kids are very rare, so it's not realistic to pit a student like that against a ""rich kid with good grades and scores"" which is as common as air in these applicant pools.<p>If I did have to pick, I'd take the more precocious kid every time.  I'd pick the kid who's able to make stuff happen for him.  There are poor kids that can do this.  There are rich kids that can do this.  It's much, much rarer to find a kid from a less privileged background with this mindset though.",1237357791

At our last meeting we discussed spending $30,000 just to supplement lost or damaged books.  There are about 1500 students total.  The school has a large supply of computers and very good internet access.  I've been able to find various materials online, especially for math and computer topics.  Still, I wonder if it would be practical to encourage the entire school to move in that direction.

This means that it matters a great deal, in these countries, where you went to school.<p>In the US, partly as a consequence of the silly admissions system, the talent's much more widely spread around. So there are more colleges worth teaching at, and consequently we have 50-100 excellent schools.

Sure, zombies are a threat, but bigger picture, they're just a background concern compared to the threat that other people present, and that's where the meat of good zombie apocalypse media resides: human interaction.<p>The scenario allows for an accelerated skewing of human interaction that extends not to just distrust of strangers, but absolute loyalty to anyone that's proven their trust.

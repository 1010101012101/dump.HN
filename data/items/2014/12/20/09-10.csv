I&#x27;d ballpark that mass as 90 lbs or so.  They&#x27;d hire a software engineer who was 110 lbs soaking wet for $100k a year though, right?  So clearly that engineer succeeded in an enterprise sales process at least once.<p>People tell me that that&#x27;s different, but it is and it isn&#x27;t.  I closed my first (small) enterprise deal for AR, for a consortium of over a dozen hospitals (we got a tiny sliver of their appointments business), back when our run rate was below $2k a month.  I felt pretty terrified about being on the phone with a VP they had around <i>just</i> to talk about HIPAA compliance, but no part of that conversation was a blocker to them doing the deal.  (Long story short: I had done my homework on HIPAA and demonstrated that I understood what I was promising them.  I then delivered it.  The end.)",1419069542

Is it hackers attack on Sony or Sony making a movie on North Korean ruler(as I understand) or both?<p>Every human/culture has likes,dislikes ...etc and every one expect others not crossing those lines for peaceful co-existence. In democracy, no doubt, there is freedom of expression but if that expression is uncomfortable to other, then there is responsibility to control/prevent that expression rather than brazenly going ahead ignoring sensitivities of others.<p>If the story line as I understand from mass media is, assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and if North Korea protested it, then Sony should have understand and accommodated the sensitivities of North Korea and stopped making this movie. It is not censorship as President Obama noted.<p>People on HN voiced concern on NSA surveillance ...etc, since many felt privacy/anonymity is violated...etc. Just like you have sensitivities, North Korea too has sensitivities and it is natural to expect, others to understand them. Whether it is, dictatorship or democracy and their relative merits/demerits is different point of discussion.<p>I am neither supporting hacker&#x27;s attack on Sony nor North Korea but Sony in first place, should have considered the sensitivities of other cultures, even if they are alien to your culture and act accordingly, given the story line.<p>Arts should further enable the stability or peace on earth and you may not achieve peace by hurting sentiments of others.",1419069139

When we&#x27;re doing dogfights for true Enterprise accounts, we&#x27;re doing them against publicly traded companies whose annual reports filed with the SEC says that > 60% of their annual revenue comes from less than 100 firms.  Do the math on what that means their average account size must be for those 100 firms.  It&#x27;s nuts.<p>There are things you can say to me which will, quickly, get me to say &quot;Look, I&#x27;ll be honest: we&#x27;d love to have your business, but we&#x27;re not the right fit for your organization.  Can I give you the phone number of our #1 competitor?  They&#x27;re widely regarded as pretty trustworthy in the industry, and they&#x27;re focused on helping customers who, broadly speaking, look like your organization.&quot;  (Here&#x27;s an example: &quot;Does it integrate with SAP?  Because we would need that.&quot;  Ack, that will <i>never</i> happen, nope nope <i>nope</i>.)<p>That said, how can e.g. St. Jude Hospital (not a client, but representative of a few clients we have) use AR at the same time that Bugs Be Gone Exterminators (a 2 man firm) uses AR?  Well, both of them also use Excel, right?  Very different use cases, but same core need, and the sales model for Excel lets Microsoft offer it to both companies for an amount which is, for the exterminators, a trivial amount of money and for an amount which is, for St. Jude, so far below the noise floor it barely registers.<p>AR sells the same way, except it is a <i>much</i> narrower product than Excel is.  To the extent that &quot;It sure would be great if someone got a call from me&quot; is the same problem for those two firms, we&#x27;re equally capable of servicing it.  (They have different needs, particularly with regards to privacy and compliance, which is why the hospital pays &quot;rather more money than any of my published pricing suggests&quot;, but at the end of the day it is the same for loops executing the same state machine talking to the same Twilio APIs from the same hardware overseen by the same geek.)",1419068937

IMHO these (NYT, Economist) outlets are lukewarm at best.<p>If you&#x27;ll allow a digression, even if you do think the new media is working reasonably well, let&#x27;s work together to enumerate what some of the problems are with big media that, if they were addressed, would make them better:<p>1.) News readership (consumer) not the source of funding, sponsors and advertisers are<p>2.) Most large media outlets have been bought by other corporate interests<p>3.) Changing technology and culture has created a void of long format messaging (and the death of usual distribution channels - which maybe is a good thing?)<p>4.) Government drastically improved symbiotic working relationship with media, challenging its role as an effective Fourth Estate<p>5.) News media outlets routinely surveilled and journalists legally challenged on big stories, chilling knowledgeable informants and would be whistleblowers<p>6.) Political and legal barriers and costs of investigative journalism high, demand and compensation low<p>7.) Fundamental lack of reporting and self-reporting on media organizations themselves<p>8.) Lack of competition due to &#x27;enshrined&#x27; reputations and primetime due to trust relationships with content services - plus girth of production in long tail (and in major suppliers) of low quality, uncorrected, inaccurate, misleading, politicized, propogandized, or unprofessional work due to lowered costs of production<p>9.) &#x27;Gamification&#x27; of the consumer for views (thus dollars) - including the short media attention span, use of talking heads, scare media, infotainment, eccentric coverage of irrelevancies, invention of false controversies<p>(More welcome)<p>Certainly Facebook and Twitter aren&#x27;t editorialized and <i>are</i> subject to and gamed by social media optimization.

8195339,comment,8193869,8194581,8,0,jameshart,,,"Another great example of a rule that exists in English that native speakers generally follow without knowing, but is taught to learners of English as a second language, is the rule of which adjectives form comparatives and superlatives by suffixing &#x27;-er&#x27; and &#x27;-est&#x27;, and which by prefixing &#x27;more&#x27; and &#x27;most&#x27;.<p>As a native English speaker I was never taught a rule that explains why I would say <i>hotter</i> or <i>wrigglier</i> or <i>redder</i> or <i>wildest</i> or <i>shiniest</i>, but <i>more emphatic</i>, <i>more open</i>, <i>most excellent</i> or <i>most orange</i>. I&#x27;d always assumed adjective -er and -est suffixes were just irregular, with no pattern to them at all.<p>But it turns out there&#x27;s basically a simple rule - if it ends in &#x27;-y&#x27; or has only one syllable, you suffix it; otherwise you use the &#x27;more&#x27; or &#x27;most&#x27; form. It&#x27;s remarkably solid as a rule, and even when I come up with a word that sounds sort of right to my ear that doesn&#x27;t follow the rule - like, for example, I can kind of see &#x27;wickedest&#x27; as being a valid form - it turns out that if I think about it, it probably doesn&#x27;t sound right after all, and I would probably prefer &#x27;most wicked&#x27;.",1408406351

8195335,comment,8195223,8195223,12,0,chrissnell,,,"Are size and efficiency the most pressing issues to solve in nuclear power?  I don&#x27;t know a thing about nuclear issues but from the layperson&#x27;s perspective, it seems like security is the biggest problem that keeps nuclear power from being used everywhere.   These containers are essentially dirty bombs without detonators and must be protected as such.  This might work for the military, where you could secure one on a restricted section of a FOB, but how would this work for a small town in Alaska, as the article suggests?   Securing the site is only half of the problem, too.  You also have to secure the supply chain for the nuclear material, as well as the disposal.  The cost of disposal is another challenge.  Imagine the difficulties of transporting the spent fuel from the Alaskan village.<p>These guys have a big challenge ahead of them but it would be quite awesome if they can pull it off.  Prime power generation and the supply chain issues that its fuel entails is a huge and extremely expensive problem for the military.   If you could safely build this in a CONEX, that would be impressive.",1408406305

It can actually be more performant than the second as well, since the code inside the body of the function (which may have been compiled during another invocation of the compiler on a seperate file) now knows the dynamic type of the object it&#x27;s dealing with, meaning all interior virtual calls can be made direct.<p>The first form of &#x27;someMethod&#x27; will also accept all 4 combinations of moves and copy operations on &#x27;SomeClass&#x27;: (copy a, copy b), (copy a, move b), (move a, copy b), (move a, move b). Your second, less convenient, function results in moves degrading to copies, leaving performance on the table if &#x27;someMethod&#x27; performs mutation.<p>Your &#x27;y = f(x)&#x27; ambiguity isn&#x27;t a problem in practice, since most code styles use different naming conventions for classes/structs and function names.<p>Conversions, construction, copy, move, and assignment semantics etc, are one of the most important, and one of the most difficult things to get right, when it comes to class design. If you make sane choices though, and put thought in to it, automatic conversions etc shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome.",1408405878

This creates a bunch of issues when compiled on 32 and 64 bit architectures and there is a substantial amount of effort to clean it up.<p>I point out things like this to colleagues who are very pro-C++ and I inevitably get the same response: &quot;well that&#x27;s just bad API design&quot;.<p>Thing is, if you look at the history of this example it&#x27;s a series of incremental changes, all well-meaning and reasoned, some of which are done by people who I could only call luminaries, and even they make significant and far-reaching mistakes.<p>So what hope do the rest of us have?<p>But my biggest problem with the C-dialects is pointers. Namely if you return or receive a pointer, it&#x27;s not necessarily clear who owns it. The way this is handled is comments like &quot;DO NOT delete this&quot; or &quot;you MUST delete this&quot;.<p>I like that a language like Rust is trying to formalize the concept of object ownership. I&#x27;d really like to see that idea mature and take hold.<p>Until now there hasn&#x27;t really been a competitive alternative to C/C++. It&#x27;s not Go (as much I love Go). Maybe it&#x27;s Rust. We can but hope.<p>My other big problem (and this applies to Java too) is directly dealing with low-level multithreading primitives like threads, thread groups and mutexes. I really like that Go has taken a different approach here.<p>What I find with particularly young programmers is they don&#x27;t have the appropriate fear of writing multithreaded code. It&#x27;s really, really hard to write correct multithreaded code with low-level primitives. It&#x27;s why (excellent) books like <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i> exist.<p>As for the feature list of C++14 [1], I wonder what all these &quot;auto&quot; declarations will do to the significant work required for static analysis tools, that are an essential part of modern, large-scale C++ codebases.<p>The literal types (like &quot;s&quot; for std::string or seconds) are cute but at some point the STL was optional. I&#x27;m a little leery of embedding it directly in the language but hey I&#x27;m no expert.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14</a>",1408403831

If that&#x27;s open standards and open software (and it often is), that&#x27;s great. There are some cases, however, where that&#x27;s either not feasible or not as practical.<p>As an example: smartphones. There&#x27;s a lot of functionality with modern smartphones (e.g. app distribution, remote management, etc.) which you can&#x27;t do with open standards. Saying &#x27;only use free software and open standards&#x27; is great, except that that would preclude government officials from using any smartphones on the market (Android included), and not using smartphones or tablets would make things worse for government, not better (example: the Saskatchewan government moving to iPads for cabinet ministers to save hundreds of thousands on printing costs for reproducing documents for ministers).<p>And in the end, organization should play to their strengths and consider all the aspects. An increase in licensing fees to MS (which are typically done once, in a volume licensing agreement) may be comparable to ongoing desktop support for new users who aren&#x27;t familiar. It&#x27;s much easier to hire office workers, administrative assistants, office managers, etc. who are familiar enough with Microsoft Office to be proficient, but for whom OpenOffice would provide a not-insubstantial learning curve. A lengthened onboarding process plus further desktop support leads to a higher operating cost. The TCO, to use a term I haven&#x27;t heard for years, <i>can</i> (not definitely, but possibly) be higher with open-source software and operating systems.<p>Likewise, it&#x27;s much easier to find software solutions to work on Windows platforms than on Linux platforms. The local transportation authority in Vancouver uses a few large software platforms designed specifically to manage large transportation authorities, and which provides everything they need, and which, of course, only runs on Windows. There are open-source solutions, but the support costs may well be the same, since you&#x27;re still contracting a company to manage the software for you (and the cost of licensing software typically includes some level of ongoing support). Then you&#x27;ll run into issues where you need large software solutions for which no vendors provide Linux-compatible versions (and WINE is not a solution, nor are VMs with one-off Windows licenses).<p>So yes, open-source should be a serious consideration whenever possible, but restricting government to open-source software only is no better than restricting government to proprietary systems only.",1408403704

The cool thing is that they are all procedures. It easily change the class definition without changing the code that uses it.

OOP generally involves &quot;objects&quot;, ie structs or records with visibility controls on fields, sporting &quot;methods,&quot; ie functions with a magic/hidden this/self argument. This alone doesn&#x27;t buy you much, and in fact is quite inflexible when compared to good old ADTs, so let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s more to it.<p>OOP does <i>not</i> mean &quot;all methods are defined within the class declaration/file&quot; a la Java, plenty of OOPLs allow external method definition. So it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;well in OOP I always know the behavior of my class&quot; when you have friend functions etc.<p>OOP might mean &quot;abstract classes&quot; ie virtual methods. This leads us to inheritance, which is a) not confined to OOP and b) widely criticized. Remember that inheritance != polymorphism, c.f. Visual Basic for instance (at least VB5. Showing my age...). In practice, OOP usually invokes a great-chain-of-being-like hierarchy descending from Object, but again this is not universal.<p>OOP generally means &quot;polymorphism&quot;, but the mechanisms vary widely. OOP&#x27;s &quot;Classic&quot; inheritance-driven polymorphism is probably the worst way to do it, good for quick code-reuse and that&#x27;s about it. &quot;Interfaces&quot;/pure virtual classes are a design pattern on top of abstract classes, better expressed as mixins or type-classes.<p>OOP generally implies strong typing but not always (python). OOP typing is quite clunky, especially in &quot;noun-oriented&quot; Java. You can make an argument that the rise of DI frameworks is in response to having impoverished type systems.<p>My semi-rant here is because people say things like &quot;do it this way, it&#x27;s good OOP&quot; without there being any agreement about whether we&#x27;re discussing polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, factoring, normalization, or design patterns that are largely a response to the confusion.<p>On the other hand we have folks like the clojure crowd bagging on OOP using similarly vague concepts like &quot;OOP means stateful objects/side effects&quot; ...",1408403370

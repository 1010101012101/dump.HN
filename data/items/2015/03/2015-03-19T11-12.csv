A bright indoors office with fluorescent lights is around 8EV. This means that the human eye will be receiving 16 times more light in the outdoor shade, compared to even a bright indoors room. That&#x27;s a big difference that has nothing to do with the source of the light.<p>Common sense also dictates that fluorescent lights did not get popular in homes until the last 10 years due to the rise of CFLs, and yet kids grown up in the 1970s have increased myopia rates- the source of the myopia therefore cannot be due to the indoor lights.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value</a>",1426765661

  Active protection system (I replaced the DVD drive with a SSHD)
  Fingerprint recognition thing

The OP says they install Ubuntu and all is well, but Ubuntu is going to be wanting software updates just as Windows is - it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t have separate crapware asking for them separately.<p>The lesson when it comes to installing an OS is: Be prepared. Either be somewhere where you can download your NIC (or WiFi NIC) software separately and get it onto the machine (it&#x27;s too often NIC drivers that are missing, which is pretty much the worst thing to be missing!) or get them downloaded first, after finding out what&#x27;s in the machine.<p>As for the developer account thing: I don&#x27;t know why that is, but it annoyed me too.

After almost 20 years with Solaris or Linux as my primary OS (with a brief interlude using OSX), I bought a Lenova Yoga 2 Pro and I thought I&#x27;d try using Windows as my primary OS.  Two motivators: Windows had at the time better HighDPI support than Linux, and since I use Vagrant for everything anyways, I thought I could get the best of both worlds.   That experiment didn&#x27;t last long.<p>It works both ways.   My boss is a Dev that&#x27;s been developing in Windows for a similar amount of time, and he&#x27;s being exposed to Linux for the last 3 years due to the project we&#x27;re both working on, and I can understand his frustration.<p>It&#x27;s a different mind set, really.    Emacs & the CLI are second class citizens on Windows.    Big IDE&#x27;s are second class citizens on Linux.

9231211,comment,9226497,9226497,0,0,powatom,,,"I can&#x27;t help but feel that all of these complaints about low pay etc are just a symptom of the new reality. I don&#x27;t really understand what people are expecting here. Distribution costs are minimal, audience is (kind-of) locked-in, discovery is relatively simple. The risk is almost entirely on Spotify&#x27;s end of things, rather than the artists. Yes, without the artists, Spotify doesn&#x27;t have a business - but without digital streaming services like Spotify, users could easily end up under an iTunes monopoly which probably wouldn&#x27;t be good for anybody (although I believe - may be wrong, but please correct me - that iTunes does give artists a better deal currently?). The world is going digital, and people want to stream stuff. That&#x27;s just a fact. Sure, many people will always buy CDs and LPs, but there being &#x27;no money&#x27; in recording music is hardly a new phenomenon - people have complained about it for years before digital streaming was even a thing.<p>I really do have sympathy that there isn&#x27;t much money in recorded music, but I do struggle to find a justification for why artists seem to think Spotify should be paying them more other than the fact that they just &#x27;want&#x27; it and need to make a living. I understand that completely - and honestly I&#x27;d probably pay a higher price for Spotify if they demanded it and the extra money went to artists.<p>I think the problem is this: the music industry in general has exploited artists for years. It is not a business that works in the artist&#x27;s favour, unless those artists are extremely popular (and even then, labels can seriously fuck artists over if they want to). Outside of the superstars, musicians may (not always, but often) fare better when they organise their own affairs - live performances, commissions for work, appearances, media, collaborations etc. They probably won&#x27;t get super-rich doing this, but it could be a decent income for the right artists. What we have instead is a situation where artists create music for a (more or less) one time cost (recording, mastering, equipment, studio time etc) and then hope to make the money back through physical sales, royalties, and performances. The problem, I feel, is that the initial costs of production are still high, but the distribution costs are now incredibly low, which means end-consumers are reluctant to pay higher prices. I don&#x27;t see any way around this other than altering the nature of the business itself. If production is always going to be a costly affair in the music world, then income from royalties through services like Spotify are destined to be considered low.<p>I honestly think there&#x27;s no real hope for any significant increase in income through digital services. Why should there be? There&#x27;s no technical reason to increase fees - distribution gets cheaper all the time. The only way to increase royalty payments generally is to either cut into profits, or pass the increase on to the customer - neither of which are sensible business decisions unless Spotify&#x27;s hand is forced.<p>We don&#x27;t really have a profitable relationship with music - the value we attach to a single track on iTunes or Spotify doesn&#x27;t reflect at all the costs to the artist - but unless artists can convince consumers to start paying a lot more, I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll see significant returns from recorded music any time in the forseeable future. It&#x27;s just not an industry that pays particularly well. Production costs are high, distribution costs are low. Unless we alter the way music is produced, performed, and experienced, people won&#x27;t feel like paying more gives them any extra value. It&#x27;s an uphill battle.<p>I wish things were better for artists, but I just don&#x27;t see a way out of this is that doesn&#x27;t involve massively increasing price at the point of consumption.",1426765022

The one topic is the objective reality of how something works.  The other topic is the subjective reality of how we experience that same thing.<p>Take the example that was given.  Suppose that I tell you about electromagnetism.  I tell you about the absorption spectrum of various colors.  I tell you about the fact that when we process color we subtract red from green and yellow from blue so that we can never perceive a mix of those.  I tell you about various forms of color-blindness, and the rare forms of tetrachromacy.  I can tell you everything there is to know about how the process works, and what colors will be perceived, when.  And how that differs for different people.  You still know nothing about what it is like to experience it for yourself.<p>And conversely, learning to experience it for yourself tells you very little about everything that I just told you.  For example you&#x27;ve been seeing in color for your whole life and likely are not color-blind.  If so, were you aware that it is impossible for you to see a mix of red and green as a mix of red and green?  Probably not!<p>Which returns me to my point.  Subjective experience is a necessary filter through which we perceive the objective world around us.  That experience is neither necessary nor sufficient to gain objective knowledge.

1188852,comment,1188795,1188795,0,0,CrLf,,,"The control that Apple has over the iPhone and the application distribution channel does contribute greatly to the iPhone's success. It makes the platform easily accessible to people who aren't inclined to search the internet for apps and are, in fact, afraid of doing it for all the malware experiences they have on their PCs. They know the App Store has everything, and that they can reasonably expect that the apps won't harm their device.<p>But, the iPhone is still just a phone. Most people don't hit the walls of the room Apple has them locked in. Heck, most people don't even do much with their iPhones... They rarely browse the web or use it to do serious email (one line replies in a pinch are not ""serious email"") because they find the screen too small and the experience too cumbersome when compared to a real computer. They install some apps, but never really use them besides the first few minutes, unless they're games, which also says much about the typical iPhone user: phone calls and games.<p>The people that complain about lack of openness are the exception.<p>Now, the iPad is not an iPhone. Nobody will buy it to make phone calls, although they will certainly play games in it. The iPad is more of a computer, and more people will hit the walls of Apple's control. _This_ is what's going to define the iPad's success.<p>It is a beautiful device, but if the average Joe expects it to behave more like a standard computer than an iPhone, and if Apple doesn't make it more open, it may very well end up a failure.<p>I like the iPhone, and if I weren't the kind of person that lives fine with just a basic phone, I would prefer one over the alternatives (android et al) even though it is much less open. On the other hand, I won't buy an iPad despite how beautiful it is because it is too expensive for something that's not a real computer.",1268485008

I guess this design really forces app developers to carefully choose buttons and other widgets on the UI to avoid menu as much as possible.<p>But on the occasions when menu is required, the experience sucks big on my dual-monitor setting. And there is no keyboard shortcut to ease the pain.",1268484871

1188846,comment,1188795,1188795,0,0,alain,,,"The worst enemy of freedom in software is not Microsoft, it's Apple. You're pretty free to develop and distribute software as you want on Windows. On new Apple devices, they control the way the software is distributed, they tax you, they make you obey their rules. Imagine a world with appstore as the main way of distributing software for any kind of devices. This would be hell. This is where Apple is going.\nStop using Apple. Use Linux, or if you can't, use Microsoft.",1268484645

I get some weird looks sometimes when I pull out the laptop in the cafeteria but when they see I'm running Windows 7 and I'm doing stuff on the intranet, their attitude turns to curiosity. I've had many questions like ""How does CorpNet work on your Mac?"" My usual response: ""Very well.""<p>Sure you can eat your own dog food or whatever the cool new term for this is but there's also something about using the tools that work well for the job. I don't really run anything important for work on my Mac. All of my code builds/runs on lab machines or a desktop that sits in the office which I can connect to via Remote Desktop Connection. My Mac works great as a thin client to these machines.",1268482974

Baidu is not considered friendly enough to government policies, so they want to spin their own version.<p>Just a rumor, but it doesn't sound too outlandish to me.<p>(An interesting and tangential question is how good could a state-run search engine be? My personal belief is that they could make it pretty good if they really focused on it (consider, for example, the Soviet Union and the nuclear arms race)).",1268482376

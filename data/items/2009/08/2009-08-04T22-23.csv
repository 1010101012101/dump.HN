742391,comment,741257,741375,0,0,tilly,,,"Writing tests is only good if people actually <i>run</i> them.<p>The default configuration for RubyGems doesn't run unit tests.  Therefore unit tests provide a sophisticated check for, ""Works on my machine"" but isn't so helpful for getting good bug reports about what doesn't work on other people's machines.  By contrast the default configuration for Perl's CPAN runs unit tests before you install anything, and this has been the default for Perl modules since the last millennium.  (Actually unit testing has been part of Perl culture since 1987!  Yes, the ""make, make test, make install"" idiom was in the first release of the Perl core.  This was over a decade before Kent Beck began popularizing the idea for a broader audience.)<p>And it doesn't end there.  For instance the Ruby world has no real equivalent to CPAN Testers.  That's a distributed group of people who run all of the unit tests on all of the CPAN modules on different platforms and make publicly available reports of success/fail.  That project runs nearly a half-million test suites per month.  Which makes it possible to do things like dependency analysis on CPAN modules to track down who is causing what other modules problems.  See <a href=""http://ali.as/top100/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ali.as/top100/</a>.<p>In short I'm glad that you're doing unit testing and like the tools that Ruby offers for it.  However if you're open to cross-pollination, there ARE things you can learn about unit testing from other language communities.  Some of them might be great additions to Ruby.",1249426436

One is a bit more perlish, and one is focussing on a clear, deterministic syntax. Thus, I think the conclusion easily generalizes.<p>As one wise man once said: Wether you prefer Python or Ruby depends mostly on which one you met first.",1249423618

They have very short lifespan, and there are never (in the average case) more than a few around at any one time.  After profiling, we saw lots of time spent in malloc, and wrote a fixed-size-slab bitfield-based allocator which gave fantastic performance.<p>There are some other issues with the same piece of code that need re-working, and we'll end up with a totally different approach by the end, so I don't really have a problem that needs a crowd solution; I was just curious what everyone here thinks.",1249423565

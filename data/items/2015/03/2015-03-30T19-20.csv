It&#x27;s interesting that you came away with conclusion that I aim to teach-to-the-test, which is in fact diametrically opposite to my intent.<p>My main purpose with this book is to communicate to students the power of using mathematics to model the real world. For this reason I made a great effort to show the connections between the tools of calculus and the different modelling techniques in physics.  E.g. I make sure this reasoning is understood:<p><pre><code>   (sum F)/m = a => integrate_t + v_0 => integrate_t + x_0 = x(t)

    and remember what peace there may be in silence.
    As far as possible without surrender
    be on good terms with all persons.
    Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
    and listen to others,
    even the dull and the ignorant;
    they too have their story. 
    
    Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
    they are vexations to the spirit.
    If you compare yourself with others,
    you may become vain and bitter;
    for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
    Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 
    
    Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
    it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
    Exercise caution in your business affairs;
    for the world is full of trickery.
    But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
    many persons strive for high ideals;
    and everywhere life is full of heroism. 
    
    Be yourself.
    Especially, do not feign affection.
    Neither be cynical about love;
    for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
    it is as perennial as the grass. 
    
    Take kindly the counsel of the years,
    gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
    Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
    But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
    Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
    Beyond a wholesome discipline,
    be gentle with yourself. 
    
    You are a child of the universe,
    no less than the trees and the stars;
    you have a right to be here.
    And whether or not it is clear to you,
    no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 
    
    Therefore be at peace with God,
    whatever you conceive Him to be,
    and whatever your labors and aspirations,
    in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. 
    
    With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
    it is still a beautiful world.
    Be cheerful.
    Strive to be happy.</code></pre>",1427745496

I said that calling a finalizer on an application thread can defeat the mutual exclusion that would usually be guaranteed by Java&#x27;s locking.  If the app thread holds a monitor when the finalizer is called, that would usually make the finalizer block until the app exits the monitor.

    There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
    Souls that have toil&#x27;d, and wrought, and thought with me—
    That ever with a frolic welcome took
    The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
    Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
    Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;
    Death closes all: but something ere the end,
    Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
    Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
    The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:
    The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep
    Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
    &#x27;T is not too late to seek a newer world.
    Push off, and sitting well in order smite
    The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
    To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
    Of all the western stars, until I die.
    It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
    It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
    And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
    Tho&#x27; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#x27;
    We are not now that strength which in old days
    Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
    One equal temper of heroic hearts,
    Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
    To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</code></pre>",1427745075

  baskets of olives and lemons,
  cobbles spattered with wine
  and the wreckage of flowers.
  Vendors cover the trestles
  with rose-pink fish;
  armfuls of dark grapes
  heaped on peach-down.

  On this same square
  they burned Giordano Bruno.
  Henchmen kindled the pyre
  close-pressed by the mob.
  Before the flames had died
  the taverns were full again,
  baskets of olives and lemons
  again on the vendors&#x27; shoulders.

  I thought of the Campo dei Fiori
  in Warsaw by the sky-carousel
  one clear spring evening
  to the strains of a carnival tune.
  The bright melody drowned
  the salvos from the ghetto wall,
  and couples were flying
  high in the cloudless sky.

  At times wind from the burning
  would drift dark kites along
  and riders on the carousel
  caught petals in midair.
  That same hot wind
  blew open the skirts of the girls
  and the crowds were laughing
  on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday.

  Someone will read as moral
  that the people of Rome or Warsaw
  haggle, laugh, make love
  as they pass by the martyrs&#x27; pyres.
  Someone else will read
  of the passing of things human,
  of the oblivion
  born before the flames have died.

  But that day I thought only
  of the loneliness of the dying,
  of how, when Giordano
  climbed to his burning
  he could not find
  in any human tongue
  words for mankind,
  mankind who live on.

  Already they were back at their wine
  or peddled their white starfish,
  baskets of olives and lemons
  they had shouldered to the fair,
  and he already distanced
  as if centuries had passed
  while they paused just a moment
  for his flying in the fire.

  Those dying here, the lonely
  forgotten by the world,
  our tongue becomes for them
  the language of an ancient planet.
  Until, when all is legend
  and many years have passed,
  on a new Campo dei Fiori
  rage will kindle at a poet&#x27;s word.

  Warsaw, 1943</code></pre>",1427744912

We have developed several heuristics and algorithms which address real world issues in network planning. This post is about some of the changes precipitated by technology changes in planning of Telco networks.<p>Telecom networks have evolved significantly with SDN and NFV. These networks were predominantly static with the exception of GMPLS (or equivalent variants) supported restoration in certain areas or layers of the network. However with SDN and NFV, newer demands and requirements are being placed on network capability. Network Planning tools have had to evolve to keep up with the dynamic demands being placed on networks.<p>With the adoption of GMPLS(or equivalent variants), networks evolved to support protection schemes with restoration capability. From the perspective of a network planning group, in every carrier, it was immediately important to right size the network to handle failure with enough room to provide shared protection for circuits. How does one plan for shared protection and restoration schemes ?<p>With SDN, network abstraction and orchestration became topics of interest for Network Operators. Gone are the days when only extra-traffic would create a bonus revenue stream. Is it possible to orchestrate network services to gain revenue ? Is it possible to orchestrate where customers are likely to be better served (read high frequency trading). In a nutshell, can dynamic network resource utilization intelligently create new revenue streams. More levels of service differentiation are possible. Can new business models be spun off based on this ? Demand driven, network aware, time aware and business model cognizant schemes for route selection are important considerations.<p>To learn more about these and other ways you can benefit, contact us at info@kloudspun.com

It&#x27;s editor, not viewer.<p>I think the two concerns I stated are probably legit, but this one is boring to me. Vim is nicer than less for reading files. I have more navigation commands. I can yank part of the file and save it somewhere else. I can pipe a range of lines through awk/etc. I can switch between files. I can split my screen. Etc. Some of these are probably available in less too (more than more(1) supported in 2001), but I doubt all, and I already know the commands in vim. I&#x27;m interested in not clobbering my logs and not crashing the server, but if you tell me vim is an editor not a viewer, I&#x27;ll ask Why?<p>Btw re-reading my words I don&#x27;t mean to sound combative.

A street blocked off to all though,
A street that&#x27;s real, impossibly real, and right,
        unconsciously right,
With the mistery of things lying under live beings and

With death spreading darkness on walls and white hair on

With fate driving the cart of everything down nothingness

Today I&#x27;m clearheaded, as though I were going to die,
Having no more brotherly feeling for things
Than to say good-bye, turning this house and this side of
         the street
Into a line of coaches in a long train with its whistle
         shrieking good-bye
From inside my head,
And a nerve-wracking, bone-cracking jerk as it moves off.<p>Today I&#x27;m mixed up, like someone who thought
          something and grasped it, then lost it.
Today I&#x27;m torn between the allegiance I owe
Something real outside me - The Tobacco Shop across
          the street,
And something real inside me - the feeling that it&#x27;s all a
         dream.<p>I failed in everything.
Since I was up to nothing, maybe it was all really
         nothing.
From learning and training for anything useful I escaped
By slipping off to the country with great plans,
By found only grass and threes there,
And when there were people, they were just like any
        others.

But my takeaway from the world of patchcables is that alot are more flakey than people really notice.<p>* The problem with the phrase &quot;Chinese made&quot; and its like is that between two things made in China you might see wildly different quality.  The real thing that drives how well something is made is the quality standards the goods are expected to meet.   Typically the case with bad Chinese made goods is that the quality was not met, either it was not expected, it was not tested or not enough pressure was put on the manufacturer to meet the standards.<p>What the previous test BJC did mainly reveals is that cables are not being tested to meet the standards they are expected to meet.

Many decisions require a forecast, and algorithms are almost always better forecasters than humans (Dawes, 1979; Grove et al., 2000; Meehl, 1954). The ubiquity of computers and the growth of the “Big Data” movement (Davenport & Harris, 2007) have encouraged the growth of algorithms but many remain resistant to using them. Our studies show that this resistance at least partially arises from greater intolerance for error from algorithms than from humans. People are more likely to abandon an algorithm than a human judge for making the same mistake. This is enormously problematic, as it is a barrier to adopting superior approaches to a wide range of important tasks. It means, for example, that people will more likely forgive an admissions committee than an admissions algorithm for making an error, even when, on average, the algorithm makes fewer such errors. In short, whenever prediction errors are likely—as they are in virtually all forecasting tasks—people will be biased against algorithms.</i><p>1: <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WPAF201410-AlgorthimAversion-Dietvorst-Simmons-Massey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WPAF201410-Algort...</a>",1427743343

When the new homes started going on sale for half what I paid, I did the math on how long it was going to take at historical real estate appreciation rates (roughly 3%/year).<p>I stopped paying, tried to work out a modification to reduce the principal with Bank Of America (who completely botched it), they transferred it to a &quot;specialty servicer&quot; who specializes in modification (who also botched it), and then ended up just letting it go into foreclosure.<p>Was 3-7 years of less than perfect credit worth it? It appears so. Houses in my old neighborhood are still significantly underwater.<p>This isn&#x27;t isolated though. ~17% of homeowners are underwater, and appreciation has slowed to a snail&#x27;s pace, meaning those people aren&#x27;t going to be able to sell for a long time [1].<p>From zillow:<p>> In the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S. negative equity rate – the percentage of all homeowners with a mortgage that are underwater, owing more on their home than it is worth – stood at 16.9 percent, unchanged from the third quarter. Negative equity had fallen quarter-over-quarter for ten straight quarters, or two-and-a-half years, prior to flattening out between Q3 and Q4 of last year.<p>> While this may not seem very notable (after all, overall negative equity didn’t go up, merely flattened out), this represents a major turning point in the housing market. The days in which rapid and fairly uniform home value appreciation contributed to steep drops in negative equity are behind us, and a new normal has arrived.

  Alone and self-exiled
  In the midst of a crowd
  Something not quite a thought flickers and is gone
  Leaving just enough to tell it came

You don&#x27;t have to worry about whether the functions run in series, or parallel, you just define that one function depends on another and it just works.<p>I have yet to see a promise example, or a generator example that had the combination of maintainability and legibility that an async.auto has. What I really want to see is a reasonably complicated task that has say 8 or more asynchronous steps mocked out in generators. Say something like:<p>Post a social item<p>1) Write social item to database<p>2) Write reference to social item in feed of person who posted item<p>3) Fetch friends of user who posted item<p>4) Fetch notification settings of each friend<p>5) Add a reference to the social item to each friend&#x27;s personal activity stream<p>6) Based on notification settings of each user send an email alerting each friend of the event<p>7) Invalidate activity stream cache key for poster, and friends<p>In this flow:<p>1 & 3 can run in parallel at the start as they don&#x27;t depend on anything<p>2 & 5 can run as soon as 1 is finished as they depend on the ID of the object in #1<p>4 & 5 can run as soon as 3 is finished as they depend on the friend list<p>6 can run as soon as 4 is done as it needs to know who to email and who not to email<p>7 can run as soon as 2 & 5 are done as the streams must be updated before the cache can be cleared<p>With async.auto it is easy to create 7 async functions and define the dependencies, then sit back and watch it run efficiently and magically. Later if you need to add more actions it is easy to insert another function, define what it depends on and see it working.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand how to do something like this with generators, and none of the examples I&#x27;ve seen so far is complex enough, nor do they seem to solve this problem in a format as clean as async.auto",1427742249

(Also, IIRC, I don&#x27;t think paper cartridges were ever a big thing for revolvers. Colt&#x27;s early guns removed the cylinder to reload, which meant you could theoretically carry spare loaded cylinders; Remington guns had a built-in loading lever.)  In fact,<p>&quot;<i>In 1852 an employee of Colt&#x27;s, Rollin White, came up with the idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges. He took this idea to Colt who flatly rejected it and ended up firing White within a few years.[18] Colt historian RL Wilson has described this as the major blunder of Sam Colt&#x27;s professional life.[19] Rollin White left Colt&#x27;s in December 1854 and registered a patent on April 3, 1855 in Hartford, Connecticut, as patent number 12,648: Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms.[20] On November 17, 1856 White signed an agreement with Smith & Wesson for the exclusive use of his patent. The contract stipulated that White would be paid 25 cents for every revolver, but that it was up to him to defend his patent against infringement as opposed to Smith & Wesson.[21]</i>&quot;<p>...(from Wikipedia) with the result that patent licensing meant that Colt couldn&#x27;t make or convert metallic cartridge guns until well after the Civil War (IIRC).",1427742005

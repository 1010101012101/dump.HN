8582088,comment,8581889,8581951,0,0,smsm42,,,"Don&#x27;t blame the parties. The parties react quite readily when called on something - when the electorate demands it. Look into the civil rights - is there any politician now openly opposing equal voting rights? No. Why - because all politicians are suddenly so high minded? No, because it&#x27;s an extremely unpopular position and will get one&#x27;s behind kicked on the election day. Now look at more controversial issue - say, gay marriage. Here we have politicians which wouldn&#x27;t dream of taking position for or against - in certain places - and politicians readily taking the same position in another place. Why? Is it just random? No, it&#x27;s because their electorate wants it, and politicians whose position does not match their electorate do not get elected. In fact, the president himself notably changed his position quite recently on the issue. Etc., etc. - I could name dozens of issues where politicians did whatever their electorate asked, and changed their tune when the electorate changed their opinion.<p>So why civil forfeiture is not an issue that effects change? Not because politicians are bad - they are bad in different ways, but at least in the US, their badness still can be controlled to a large measure. But because US citizens are not threatening to kick their politician&#x27;s asses if they don&#x27;t fix it. Like they do with many other hot topics of the day, quite successfully, one way or another. Why is that? I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe because civil forfeiture is something that usually happens to people that either linked to the criminal world or live in the places which are &quot;sketchy&quot; or don&#x27;t have money and connections to raise the hype. Maybe because people are reluctant to criticize law enforcement. Maybe because it is served as a part of &quot;war on drugs&quot; and &quot;think of the children&quot;, etc. Maybe there&#x27;s another reason I completely miss - but whatever it is, the problem is not the politicians, the problem is that this issue is not taken as a serious problem by the society. If you want to blame somebody who could effect the change - blame the press. They probably could raise the profile of the issue if they wanted to. But they do not.<p>So the answer to the question of &quot;who can stop them&quot; - US citizens can. If only they&#x27;d want to.",1415595438

You are defined by what you produce. Productivity is the currency that buys you respect in society. I&#x27;ve met many many people who rise above this view, but as a society, this is prevalent. Everything has to be about &quot;winning&quot; in some way - even if you are working out, or playing a game, you gotta &quot;play hard&quot;, compete, kick the other guys ass, not feel sorry for yourself, not mope, just WIN. Forget about what you&#x27;re winning, what or why you produce, as long as you produce more than the other guy. Other cultures may use wisdom, or age, or kindness as currencies for respect/status in society.<p>And then people wonder why society is becoming increasingly isolated. See, when you tie your worth to what you produce, you must give up everything to produce. EVEN IF &quot;producing&quot; means painting a beautiful portrait in your garage, the compulsion to produce is the problem. It makes people focus too hard on themselves and how they can improve/level-up. Too focused inward to see the people around you and their lives, and the joy that can bring. That isolation leads to addiction, depression, isolation and all manner of mental illness. Because humans have evolved to be social creatures. It is hardwired in our nature. We cannot and should not try to fight that. We should not view that as a sign of weakness or an obstacle to productivity, or money, or fame, or any other idol.",1415594594

Although I would like to disagree with some of your points:<p>- Sharding is only necessary for centralized systems, where there exists some &quot;Single Source of Truth&quot; of the record. GUN can and will store things in multiple places, so it behaves more like BitTorrent. This reduces the complexity and thus makes the database significantly easier to use and scale, however I had to solve some hard conflict resolution problems to get that to work.<p>- Yes, Merkle trees are awesome. But deletion is a very dangerous action in a database and should be avoided (as noted in the original article). It causes all sorts of potential data-corruption/divergence problems.<p>- All data syncs in realtime, cause GUN sports push notifications. However, if the there is a network partition, the data will sync (without problems) after it is restored. So yes, agreed, don&#x27;t do things periodically - do them immediately!<p>- Disk access is slow, correct. That is why you should keep as much of the working set in memory.

Or longer walks that cause you to realize the whole program is bunk and you ought to be building something different. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to measure the productivity of this sort of thing (except perhaps after a lot of hindsight), but it can have a huge effect on your long-term results.<p>Richard Feynmann wrote about this.

But you also <i>may</i> have just avoided a complex, long debugging session which would not result in reusable knowledge.<p>Debugging something that ultimately ends up being a 24-hour one-time glitch in AWS is a waste of time unless you learn something useful in the process or have sufficient reason to believe you altered the speed with which it was fixed, no matter how fun the journey. Sure, if it results in you deciding you need to be resilient under AWS failures more, that&#x27;s great. But often times you just burned man hours and lost the opportunity to work on something else. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that all debugging results in useful learning. (I&#x27;d probably argue the contrary, given the number of times I end up grokking incidental implementation details of some third party software or system during debugging that in just a few short months later becomes useless as that code or service is paved over.)<p>Trying to tilt the odds in your favor so you make educated guesses around when this will be the case is part of the skill. Part of this skill is also being able to recognize when a bug you thought had been routed around was simply swept under the rug, and changing course to understand it properly instead of sweeping it under the rug again. (&quot;Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... you can&#x27;t get fooled again.&quot;) I find these are the exception not the rule, and are probably worth the cost.

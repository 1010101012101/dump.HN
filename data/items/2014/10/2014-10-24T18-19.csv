It just sounds incredibly short sighted if true. That&#x27;s like, to use notax&#x27;s example location, locating your startup in North Dakota because the rent is cheap over there.<p>Amsterdam would have been a much better location with better and cheaper bandwidth from a much larger selection of providers. In addition to better infrastructure, Amsterdam has a wider and deeper talent pool for datacenter talent.
I also have a hard time really buying the tax argument as Facebook and Google have European datacenters outside Ireland and they seem to manage their Irish tax strategy just fine. Even Apple is reportedly eyeing a datacenter in the Netherlands and I doubt they would consider one if it messed with their Irish sandwitch.<p>> This might have been more important when the first location was chosen than it is now, and latencies in Europe are mostly pretty minimal anyway.<p>From experience I can tell you that there is plenty of latency to go around in Europe. Part of that is Amazon&#x27;s dubious choice of location and part of it is their network. Cloudping easily gives you latencies comparable to east coast - west coast ping times when testing from various European location to AWS Ireland.<p>Unlike popular entertainment would have you believe, Europe in not a country and neither is it the size of a postage stamp. You&#x27;d also be advised to consider that previously Ireland was Amazon&#x27;s closest location to Russia and that in itself is a pretty big country.<p>Amusingly enough Amazon&#x27;s Irish location is almost exactly like putting your datacenter in North Dakota as notax quipped.<p>Just look at this map:

The <i>actual</i> problem with the paper is that we have no idea if their simulator is any good, which means that their result (89% return in 50 days) could be totally bogus. In other words, we don&#x27;t know if the actual bitcoin exchange would fill their orders at the same prices (if at all) as their simulator does. A decent simulator for a high-frequecy strategy like this is not trivial because you have to incorporate all the exchange behavior (documented or not) into your simulator, and then you have to validate your results by comparing your simulated results to the results of some actual trading.

&quot;a participant&#x27;s gain (or loss) of utility is exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other participant(s). If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.&quot;<p>The key thing here that is is measured in utility (not in the price of the good). Of course every trade or transaction is flat in that I sold it to you for the price you bought it at (that is obvious and non-what a zero sum game means). The issue is whether we are both made better off or not.<p>If I don&#x27;t want to bear the risk of holding bitcoins and am happier mitigating that risk by selling them for dollars, my utility increased. Similarly, if you purchased them from me because you want to bear such risk, your utility increased.  Even removing the risk/uncertainty from the equation, my willingness to pay for a good is not the same as the market price. Thus, if I sell bitcoins bc my value of them is less than the current market price, then I am improved.  Similarly, if you value bitcoins above the current market price and buy them from me, then your willingness to pay was higher than the price you paid.  Thus, you have significant consumer surplus from that trade.<p>There are called pareto efficient transactions. Most transactions are actually pareto efficient where at least one of the individuals increased their utility and no one involved in the trade decreased their utility.<p>This excerpt does a good job articulating this:
&quot;Specifically, all trade is by definition positive sum, because when two parties agree to an exchange each party must consider the goods it is receiving to be more valuable than the goods it is delivering. In fact, all economic exchanges must benefit both parties to the point that each party can overcome its transaction costs, or the transaction would simply not take place.&quot;",1414176599

If I tested all 1024 states against historical data, it is likely that some of them might do very well (depending on the general architecture of the model of course).  What if I then selected the successful minority and held them up as clever strategies?  Their success would very likely have been arbitrary.  By basically brute-forcing enough strategies, I will inevitably come across some that were historically successful.  But these same historically successful strategies are unlikely to outperform another random strategy in the future.

EG: You buy a $300k property, maybe have $40k in rent, $6k in maintenance costs, but only put down $30k on the property, your total investment is $36k. On rent alone you&#x27;re returning $4k (spread between mortgage+maintenance and rent income.) $4k on a $36k investment is %11.

---
When one maniac can wipe out a city of twenty million with a microbe developed
in his basement, a new approach to law enforcement becomes necessary. Every
citizen in the world must be placed under surveillance. That means sky-cams at
every intersection, computer-mediated analysis of every phone call, e-mail, and
snail-mail, and a purely electronic economy in which every transaction is
recorded and data-mined for suspicious activity.
We are close to achieving this goal. Some would say that human liberty has been
compromised, but the reality is just the opposite. As surveillance expands,
people become free from danger, free to walk alone at night, free to work in a
safe place, and free to buy any legal product or service without the threat of
fraud. One day every man and woman will quietly earn credits, purchase items for
quiet homes on quiet streets, have cook-outs with neighbors and strangers alike,
and sleep with doors and windows wide open. If that isn&#x27;t the tranquil dream of
every free civilization throughout history, what is?

8505087,comment,8497906,8499010,0,0,curun1r,,,"My company is somewhat involved in booking and we&#x27;ve found it to be very specific to the vertical. We looked at building something that integrated with Quickbooks, but found that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to come up with something that works for enough customers to make it profitable. From what I can tell, people on the Quickbooks team tried it too and decided against it. The long tail just has too many differing needs.<p>The problem you&#x27;ve listed (not knowing how long a dental appointment will last) isn&#x27;t really a problem for a booking system...a dental office with a receptionist scheduling patients will run into the exact same issue and the same rules that the receptionist uses can be programed into a booking engine. The bigger problem for a dental office is that the calendar is locked in a management system that&#x27;s probably running on a Windows computer somewhere in the office. Maintaining two calendars is almost never going to work and the one in the cloud will never be the calendar of record. Short of going the ZocDoc route and having practices reserve certain spots for appointments booked online (businesses hate doing this), you&#x27;re always going to run into problems with conflicting appointments. The interesting thing is that most dental practices won&#x27;t care about conflicting appointments since the only patients that will book online will be new patients and patients that have fallen out of the typical schedule. Everyone else will schedule their appointments with the receptionist at the end of their previous appointment. So most dental practices will happily juggle appointments to fit those specific types of patients into their schedule.<p>But that&#x27;s the dental industry and almost every other industry has just as many quirks as the dental industry does, if not more. And that&#x27;s why the market will most likely be filled with smaller, specialized vendors that target either one or possibly a handful of verticals. I&#x27;m betting the winners will be the companies that make the management systems used by the businesses, but that&#x27;s not happening quickly since most of them are small ISVs that only understand Windows development and think cloud computing is something that meteorologists do.",1414174928

Like the other poster mentioned here, its a bit upsetting having read something that rigorously analyzes worst time behavior to have an article hand wave away log32 as &quot;effectively constant time&quot;.

The problem with our politics is that as soon as someone proposes putting muscular penalties in place for egregious misbehavior some lobbyist or PR flack will pop up with a story like &#x27;Joe Schmoe made a simple math error in distributing tip income among his restaurant staff...under a proposed new law, he could face ruin and even jail time at the hands of heartless government bureaucrats.&#x27;<p><i>Beverly Rubin, vice president of HR Shared Services with Electronics for Imaging [said:] &quot;During this process we unintentionally overlooked laws that require even foreign employees to be paid based on local U.S. standards.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit like your VP of accounting expressing surprise at discovering a requirement to file annual tax returns.<p><i>The company said it cooperated fully with the U.S. Labor Department once it became aware of the problem, and paid the back wages of the employees.</i><p>And why wouldn&#x27;t they when the costs of noncompliance are so low? Despite being caught, they still only paid CA minimum wage of $8/hour to make up the difference - good luck finding anyone competent to install computers at that price on the open market.<p>Hopefully the firm will be held to account for immigration fraud as well as labor violations, because there is no way they applied for work visas for these employees - doing so requires making declarations about wage/salary equivalence. Most likely they told their Indian employees to apply for tourist visas and say they were staying with relatives.",1414173664

If you drill in particular permission it could display history of requests for that particular API.<p>Having something like this would also allow for better audits. A separate app could show requests against a particular API by all apps as well as allow filtering. Other useful stats would be average number of requests per day per API per app and a graph of API calls by time of day. If nothing else this would allow to quickly identify rogue applications that make too many requests and drain battery.<p>On the topic of battery drain, I think that &quot;allow to run in background&quot; and &quot;run as a service&quot; would be a useful permissions as well. First one you would want to give to music players and to GPS applications, for additional control include time app allowed to run in the background before it is killed. Second permission would cover apps like IM and Facebook that are known to be tremendous battery hogs.",1414173660

Big-O notation is intended to describe <i>how the time required for an operation grows</i> as the number of items being handled gets large.  It is precisely <i>not</i> intended to communicate the absolute time the operation takes in small cases.  They are confusing people when they try to communicate both pieces of information at the same time.  What they should say is something like &quot;lookup takes O(log n) time, and for seqs of size up to N items, it takes M times as long as ArrayList.get&quot;.<p>And then, of course, to describe O(log n) time as &quot;effectively constant&quot; is just lying.<p>(Second and fourth paragraphs added in edit.)",1414173614

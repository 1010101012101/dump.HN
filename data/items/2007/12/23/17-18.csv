It seems that we agree, in most ways.<p>The anti-DP meme is just a trend that I have been detecting in the threads here, and in other places.  I was commenting on a phenomenon that is bigger than you (but to which you /do/ seem to be responding).",1198432571

As it stands, I'm thinking of getting a prescription for modafinil (this article mentions Provigil, which is just a brand name for modafinil).<p>There are already regulations in place to prevent abuse of these drugs, but they hardly work.  I think that if humans want to use something, then we should be able to use it.  Of course, there should be things like surgeon general's warnings on the various substances, and they should be sold with the safety sheet and proper precautions to take.<p>I'm surprised that more people on HN don't agree with this sentiment.  I would presume that the majority of the people here are libertarians, and deregulation of drugs goes hand in hand with that political ideology.  My guess is that most people here are worried that any promotion or tacit approval of drugs will lessen their chances of getting selected for funding.",1198432088

In other words, if you can identify a problem that you personally experience but currently has no solution, and if you can be passionate about it and fundamentally believe that it is an industry-wide problem that affects a sizable community, then you have identified the cornerstone you need to build a company.<p>The problem that I have identified is one where I want to find potential customers, customers who have never heard of us and could never find us on their own. And the only solution available to me (PR firms and conventional media) is inherently ""channel-inefficient"". So what do I do ... I do the only thing that entrepreneurs know how to do which is to force a paradigm shift. The new paradigm is an innovative marketing channel and it is called LoveMyTool.<p>LoveMyTool is all about ""Advocacy Marketing"".<p>LoveMyTool does not post press releases nor marketing collaterals. Instead we post only customer testimonials and technical reviews by third parties (i.e., advocates who ""love"" their tools and are passionate about our industry).",1198431948

I have ~2k users right now, and I get enough hits to fund hosting if I put up ads. Is it ""wrong"" to put up ads after so many users have signed up?

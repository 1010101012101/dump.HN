They hire a CEO not for the primary reason of effectiveness or experience, but instead for their perception of effectiveness in the media.  Is she an improvement over Bartz?  No doubt, because the first time I saw Bartz discussing Yahoo's future several years ago, it was immediately clear to me that they weren't getting out of their tailspin.  
Is Mayer a genius?  I'm sure of it.  But from all the things I've heard from Google employees and their dealings with her, I suspect that a lot of the hype she receives in the media is due to the lack of female role models in the Valley.  She damned sure doesn't sound like a good leader. Biting off heads, interrupting people mid sentence, forgetting what happened in the last meeting....... this is the epitome of somebody who has bitten off more than they can chew.

4252884,comment,4250731,4251967,3,0,wonderzombie,,,"State isn't so much evil as it introduces complexity.  I think we can agree that complexity, or at least unnecessary complexity, <i>is</i> evil. :) The goal isn't so much to make people stop using state, but to make people think about it and question whether the complexity of state is, in fact, necessary. Maybe the answer is yes! But you should think about it, at least.<p>To expand on that wrt OO: OO tells you to encapsulate state in objects, generally, and then ignore it b/c abstraction, implementation detail, etc. But state makes it harder to reason about your program because now (ostensibly) the same function gives different answers depending on <i>when</i> you call it, not just <i>how</i> you call it. It couples your program that much more tightly to the order of operations. It introduces a bunch of assumptions dispersed implicitly throughout your code, as everything else now has to ensure that it does the right thing when the order of operations and/or input is correct vs not. That leads to bugs.<p>The counter-narrative is along the lines of what you suggest, which is to reduce state to a very small and limited scope, and put up a bunch of red flags around it. You say ""these answers can change and <i>this</i> is the place to handle all the possibilities."" You handle it in as few places as possible, and not laterally, everywhere else a method call chain or where there is state which depends on other state. Haskell is an example of this idea taken to the Nth degree.<p>But ""the right tool for the right problem"" isn't that helpful, although I think it's a worthwhile sentiment. The goal is to get people to <i>think</i> about the complexity they add to their programs, not to lambaste them for their choices or take away those choices in the first place.",1342475606

Speaking as someone who lives in NYC, I too think it's got a lot going for it. Housing (at least compared to SF; I'm less familiar with how horrible the housing market is further as you go towards San Jose), infrastructure, a more balanced mix of people (the Valley is more dominated than NYC by 20 and 30 something male engineers), etc;<p>2. This post in some ways echoes my own feelings about Twitter {eg [1]). Twitter seems to suffer this dichotomy between being a service and being infrastructure. One of my arguments is that the messaging infrastructure that ultimately dethrones SMS is too valuable to be proprietary.<p>Of course to be clear Dalton seems to be talking about a ""real-time notification API"", which is a little different to messaging but it shares a lot of the same problem domain.<p>I think this is important infrastructure but it's going to be a thankful (and probably fruitless) task, particularly in building an open, well, whatever.<p>3. It echoes my own view that something like a ""better Twitter"" is really a ""small problem"" [2].<p>I see Dalton has responded and there he has roots in his current community. You can't argue with that. But I'm all for promoting NYC as an alternate tech hub and the idea of tackling big problems.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4186157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4186157</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4244709"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4244709</a>",1342475322

And it needs to, because if even one byte is different out of a gigabyte of input data it must return false. That's horribly inefficient.<p>With a bloom filter, you can take gigabyte-sized video files and determine if they have never been seen by the bloom filter. And the size of the bloom filter is fixed; choose the size based on expected inputs, desired accuracy, and so on and it doesn't grow based on the size of the objects being processed. With this implementation, it stores not only the hash of the video but the entire byte array of the video at the hash location in order to not have a false positive.<p>So it's possible to have an opposite-of-a-bloom-filter with only 8 buckets, but it consumes terabytes of storage space because you're processing really massive files.",1342473482

Running a public company is vastly different and considerably more complex than managing large teams.  She has to build an executive team capable of executing on all fronts.  This is beyond hiring the best engineers and product managers, it is about hiring a CFO, COO, GMs, VPs, etc. that can execute on the plan set out by the CEO.<p>2. Managing a stagnating business requires different skills than a rapidly growing business.  Google benefitted from exponential growth in usage, users, revenue.  Yahoo is already over the hill.  Most incoming CEOs do a top-down review of the business to understand assets and liabilities.   They visit customers and large investors.  In the end, they have to present a credible plan to the BOD for refocusing the business.  Where should you invest or divest?  Should you be aligned along product lines, geographically, or along customer segments?<p>3. Yahoo needs deep tech investments - to do so, it must attract and retain brilliant engineers.  It is my understanding that Ms. Mayer's focus at google has been product and not technology.  Without proper engineering, the best product ideas will fizzle.

I&#x27;ve seen lots of cases where a guy works 10 hours a day but simply isn&#x27;t a productive member of the team.  Others work maybe 2-3 hours per day and are the most productive people around.  I don&#x27;t know you or your situation but it&#x27;s entirely possible that your long work hours are just not being used effectively.  In addition to finding a new job I would seriously suggest that you take a moment to reflect on how others (not just your boss) consider your value as a productive team member and be careful not to confuse the fact that someone at work might think you&#x27;re an awesome guy personally with whether or not they think you&#x27;re highly productive.<p>Even if you&#x27;re <i>NOT</i> productive, your boss is horrible and the company you work for is horrible so you should leave anyways.  I hope it works out for you and you find better, happier employment in the future.",1394053153

But if you need to run administrative scripts on a bunch of servers, SSH as root is usually the easiest way to do that. I certainly trust sshd and RSA/ECDSA a lot more than some supposedly-secure setuid executable that lets me run commands as root.<p>Plus (as you probably know) you can specify in public key files that only certain IP addresses can log in using that keypair.<p>I&#x27;ve read that the general &quot;don&#x27;t log in as root&quot; mentality is really an artifact of the telnet days when you didn&#x27;t want people to sniff your passwords easily... not sure how true that is.",1394053125
7349854,comment,7348832,7348832,4,0,rguldener,,,"I really miss focusing on the details of their desktop product here: About a week ago I tried to switch away from Chrome and back to FF and its been a rough week. Speed wise FF is actually great, absolutely no complaint here, same goes for memory. What I didn&#x27;t expect and what kind of shocked me is how broken some web pages are on FF. For instance in GMail I can&#x27;t use Cmd+arrow keys to jump to the beginning or end of a line and on the new Google maps (the one that has been around as a preview for more than a year) zooming by scrolling simply does not work. It&#x27;s not just Google sites though, I had stutering scrolling on some more complex sites (where Chrome has no issue) and some startup pages have oddly shaped buttons and similar layout issues. It seems like many sites aren&#x27;t testing on FF anymore.<p>I really expected FF to be on par with Chrome in terms of rendering quality but that really turned out not to be the case in many small, yet annoying corner cases. They got big by incorporating the quirks of IE and then improving on that, maybe it is time they start thinking about implementing some of the WebKit rendering quirks and go from there.<p>I really want to keep on using FF and to love it but if it means I have to switch browsers for some of the sites I use daily that will be difficult.<p>Using FF 27 on OS X 10.9.2",1394053125

7349835,comment,7349627,7349627,2,0,batoure,,,"I understand the argument that this article is trying to make. But I feel like ultimately it is a semantic argument around the use of the word science in a job title that has little to do with what people actually in those roles accomplish.<p>I think its important to first understand that the idea of the data scientist is somewhat reactionary. For a time in data analysis a popular title was &quot;quantitative scientist&quot; these people were more often mathematician or statistician focused domain experts who synthesized results out of data-sets. They did cool things with with data and this helped sell many of companies on the need to expose data for use internally.<p>But most &quot;quantitative scientists&quot; were not software minded, that is to say the upper end of the average space touched on the &quot;citizen developer&quot; skill level and no higher. That meant that as companies scaled and collected data the work of the &quot;quantitative scientists&quot; broke down and couldn&#x27;t be implemented in production contexts.<p>What emerged over the last 5 or 6 years is a group of people who came from the other direction. They generally had a more intense focus on the manipulation of data, but they melded this with a non expert but effective use of quantitative science to get great results.<p>Would calling these roles &quot;quantitative analysis data engineers&quot; be more descriptive sure but somewhere along the line someone or ones wrote articles and coined a term that captured the imagination of the industry.<p>The Author attempts to put forth the idea that &quot;Data Science&quot; is inexorably linked with &quot;Big Data&quot; and that as that trend cools so will the field. Again I would think that this is a misunderstanding of the field. Most companies hiring for the field use Big Data as a code word for, we aren&#x27;t sure what to do about our problem. So although many companies seem to have that as a must have when approaching a problem the truth is that it is often a recognition of lack of internal proficiency.  Part of being an expert in the field is trying to help companies realize what type of data and analysis actually brings the company value.",1394052985

7349832,comment,7348622,7349640,1,0,yesiamyourdad,,,"You&#x27;re arguing two different things. First: if changes to a company enhance its long term value, it may benefit short term shareholders, but logically, long-term holders will benefit more. In fact, if short term holders were to benefit more then it makes no sense to be a long term holder, and if long term holders stand to benefit more, then why would you be selling all, or practically all, of your position? If someone buys a company&#x27;s stock, insists on major structural changes, and then sells the stock, how can you argue that this investor is acting in the long term investor&#x27;s interest without either being a financial incompetent or altruistic to the point of sainthood?<p>For the risk tolerance point, you&#x27;re assuming that everyone who opposes Icahn is overinvested in eBay, which doesn&#x27;t follow at all. It may be that you would rather see eBay invest in itself or return excess cash in the form of a steady dividend. Or you may flat out disagree with the notion of spinning off Paypal. Making a stupid decision isn&#x27;t &quot;risk tolerance&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;hey man, hold my beer and watch this&quot;.",1394052976
7349831,comment,7344503,7349589,1,0,Zarel,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;ll admit that other CloudFlare customers are likely subsidizing the amount of bandwidth I&#x27;m using.<p>Funny thing - back when I was using 10 TB/mo, my site was hosted entirely on DreamHost&#x27;s $9/mo shared hosting. I moved mostly because I was starting to get several hours a month of downtime - presumably, they were gently nudging me off their service.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of $60-$100 dedicated servers come with unlimited-use 100Mbit connections, which work out to 16ish TB/mo before you start getting to 50% saturation. Of course, those are still subsidized in that that pricing is possible only because most people who buy it don&#x27;t max out a 100Mbit connection.<p>Still, though, S3&#x27;s 9-12¢/GB bandwidth pricing seems a bit high. Bandwidth at DigitalOcean (presumably unsubsidized) is 2¢/GB, which comes out to a much more manageable $500 for 25 TB.<p>With dynamic content, CloudFlare has Railgun, which takes advantage of the fact that dynamic content is usually mostly static. Still, though, if you have 25 TB of dynamic content, I presume bandwidth stops becoming the limiting factor in your cost of operation.",1394052961

Two weeks is a courtesy and nothing more.<p>You can quit on the spot.  In fact, do it and do it nicely and when the boss goes ballistic about finishing up work you are doing then you can make a gentle offer to contract back at a much higher HOURLY rate.  It needs to be higher for two reasons: 1) because legally you&#x27;re gonna have to pay self-employment taxes on it but 2) you&#x27;re gonna leave with a little bit of pain on his side.  With the possibility of your current company being tight on cash you might want to be sure you get prepaid some # hours before you set foot back in the door.  Collecting might be tougher after the fact.<p>And whether you leave on the spot or work those last two weeks, DO leave yourself a week of decompression time before the next job.  You&#x27;ll start a lot fresher and be in a great mood.  Start dates are always negotiable and don&#x27;t have to be exactly two Mondays after the offer letter is printed.",1394052822

7349761,comment,7349122,7349527,1,0,transientbug,,,"Part of the problem for why this stuff isn&#x27;t taught in high school as much is that (and I do say this with some hesitance, as an engineering student who has had a strong math education, imo) I feel most people would probably not benefit much from having that additional content added into the high school course. The other and more major issue I see is that universities seem to be (just from personal experience and hearing friends stories too) starting to want students to take most of their higher maths, that above basic algebra it seems sometimes, at the university. While you could argue that this is because they are greedy and want more money from forcing students to take more classes, I&#x27;d like to think that the reason why is because of how fragmented american high school math courses can be.<p>Personally, as an engineering student, I&#x27;d rather take most of my math classes here at my university because they tend to all be tied together (both with the math department and engineering department courses) well and I know that where I leave off in Ordinary Diff Eq, I will pick right back up from in Ord. Diff. Eq 2. Coming from having taken calculus and calculus 2 in high school and having entered straight to calculus 3 in university, I didn&#x27;t have this comfort and in fact ended up missing some content between the classes as a result. There is also the issue of choice, and the limits of it within the context of high school curriculum.<p>Just my 2 cents against teaching additional stuff in high school (or probably addressing the wrong point within this comment). Also, I&#x27;m not sure (obviously) what its like across the nation, but at my high school at least these topics where all covered and taught to (nearly) all students:  \n> Basic algebra and geometry: Order of operations; simplifying expressions; solving quadratic equations by factoring; finding area and perimeter of shapes; the classic &quot;garden problem&quot; (maximize area of a rectangle given fixed sum of 3 sides); naming the Platonic solids; adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing complex numbers; logarithms; solving exponential equations.

You&#x27;re going to have to take the lead on owning the product, there&#x27;s no getting around this.  There&#x27;s almost no chance you&#x27;re going to find a co-founder that&#x27;s going to handle the product/development, etc while you focus on marketing.  I&#x27;ve tried and each time has ended badly.  I advise against co-founders unless you know the person well and have worked with them in the past.<p>Here&#x27;s the key to getting something developed in as little time and effort as possible.  Start with the design.  What the user will see when they come to the site.  Don&#x27;t worry about the backend at all.<p>Search on Dribble for designers - they don&#x27;t have to be front-end developers.  Actually better if they&#x27;re not (cheaper).  For more affordable quality designers, search eastern europe/russia.<p>Contact a bunch of designers, see if they&#x27;re available and what their rates are.  See how quickly they respond, etc.  Select 3 or 4 and give each one the same first task.  It should be something that takes 2-3 hours.  It could be taking a sketched mockup, polishing it up, etc.  After each one has completed this, you pick the one you feel was the best.<p>A lot of good designers know good front-end developers.  You can find one through the designer.  If not, you can do the same process on odesk for both front-end and back-end developers.<p>This is the process I use after a lot of trial and error, and it works the best for me.",1394052214

The valuable material wasn&#x27;t the classes reviewing  geometry or speed-reading -- it&#x27;s taking and reviewing the SAT repeatedly. Organizations like Summa can produce SAT-like practice tests, because the highly-prepared kids have probably taken all of the example tests the College Board provides.<p>The SAT is an easy test; no individual question is really that hard. Getting a high score is about knowing how to take the test, and this is learned by taking it many times. Unless the College Board releases many more practice tests (with answer keys and explanations), I don&#x27;t think this program will mean much.<p>Note that I&#x27;m talking about getting very high scores -- the SAT is a completely different game when your goal is to get into ultra-competitive schools.

Of course I am aware of that.<p>How do you read my question and interpret simply it as &quot;lets send all of the images in full and then give their index and call it compression?&quot;??  What I suggest is that we take a standard encoding technique like Huffman, or some modification, but rather than creating a table based on data in an individual image, build this code table by analyzing many, many images.<p>I have read the Wikipedia article on Huffman coding before.  However, the details are not really important in regards to my point.<p>What I am suggesting is that rather than looking at just the bits in individual images and using them to construct a Huffman table or some other kind of reference, look at the bits on many, many images and create a larger reference table.  And then of course you may need a local table for things in the image that don&#x27;t quite correspond to the larger table.<p>Earlier compression techniques were much more constrained in terms of processing power, RAM, network connectivity etc. and so distributing and using a large table for compression was not practical.  I am suggesting that someone who has knowledge of compression engineer a system where 10MB, 50MB, or 100MB of RAM is used and a large common bits file is transmitted, rather than starting with the idea that almost all of the data or all of the data has to be contained in one file.

Ever see <i>Wall Street</i>?

These are guys who generally became &quot;turnaround CEOs&quot; of large companies in their 30s (or even 20s), and never grasped the idea that there&#x27;s a difference between the architect and the wrecking ball.

He also likes to lay about with the axe handle; his accusations of eBay board malfeasance exist at the intersection of ignorance and ambition.<p>Case in point: his Skype accusations. It&#x27;s not like Skype was overperforming when eBay sold it off; eBay had failed to make use of the company&#x27;s tech, and the sale let them keep about 35% of the value in the company while letting someone else run it. If I recall, they bought the company for about $3b, sold 65% off for a hair under $2b, and then got $2.5b from the MSFT purchase. Icahn seems to think that MSFT&#x27;s valuation indicated that eBay could have sold that turkey for more, but that seems unlikely -- when MSFT bought it, Skype had put its IPO on indefinite hold, and no one else even put in a bid, which indicates that if anyone should be furious, it&#x27;s Redmond&#x27;s own shareholders.",1394051552

Initially it was a &#x27;the next available flight is in a week&#x27; situation, which clearly wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. We went through some problem solving however and found a solution that totally worked. They booked me on a flight instead to DFW or SAT (can&#x27;t remember which), with a layover in CLT. I went on Twitter and found a friend driving to SXSW who was going to pick me up then and take me there from the alternate nearby city. They also put me on standby for a flight from CLT to AUS. The standby totally worked out, and I got to Austin only an hour later than originally anticipated.<p>However, if the person at the gate/ticketing doesn&#x27;t feel like helping you then frequently you&#x27;re just kinda screwed. I&#x27;ve had dozens of situations like this where I was able to convince them to try something &#x27;different&#x27; with me and it worked out well.<p>If an App helped me automatically rebook and find my options that I&#x27;d otherwise have to go beg a customer service agent for... that would be awesome.

If the axioms don&#x27;t permit those theories, then we&#x27;ll do away with the axioms and pick a different set.<p>Is this related to the famous incompleteness theory? If you hit a proof that you can&#x27;t prove with this set of axioms, you just try another one? It blows my mind that you can just pick any set of axioms you like.

Any recommendations for these kinds of questions?<p>> So you question about why libraries don&#x27;t exist is essentially &quot;Why have mathematicians not replicated hundreds or thousands of years of effort in to a format that&#x27;s hard for them to personally use, but is good for these tools we&#x27;ve developed in the past couple decades?&quot;<p>Okay, so people are working on it. It seems like a miracle that the alternative of &quot;we&#x27;re doing it all in our heads&quot; actually works:<p>> Mathematicians generally don&#x27;t evaluate the truth of a new paper relative to the axioms, but relative to the already established results in a field.<p>This is what I&#x27;m taking about.

Or automatically eliminate proof steps to make them less complicated! Compiler-style optimization if you will. Wouldn&#x27;t it be amazing if thousands of existing proofs could be analyzed statistically? Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could machine-translate standardized proofs into regular ol&#x27; mathematical notation or whatever language we want? When we have the ability in the future, we can go back and verify them all en masse! Am I deluded in thinking any of this could be valuable?<p>> You seem to imply that mathematical notation should be standardized, but are omitting that even languages explicitly meant for computation are not.<p>Well, at least programming languages without standards have an implementation that is <i>the</i> official implementation! So arguably, they <i>are</i> more standardized.<p>Anyway, thanks for replying, I haven&#x27;t had such an interesting exchange on HN in a while.

HAML has zero debugging overhead because it&#x27;s not a programming language; it&#x27;s just not that hard, period. HAML does add an extra step to the build process, but who cares? It&#x27;s trivial. In a world where CI and single command deploys are commonplace, the idea that an extra build step would prohibit the use of any developer tool seems absurd. It reminds me of people who argue against unit tests because &quot;ugh, just another tool to learn&quot;, or &quot;I end up writing more code in tests than actual code, I just want to <i>ship</i>&quot;. God forbid you actually have to learn something. While we&#x27;re at it, please avoid the use of languages that compile to machine code because who the hell wants to deal with a linker in their build process?<p>Now, although I&#x27;m a huge CoffeeScript fan, CoffeeScript is an entirely different beast, and requires a deep understanding of JavaScript to use correctly. I can understand not wanting to devote time to teaching engineers about the finer nuances of CoffeeScript, especially if they aren&#x27;t that experienced with JavaScript to begin with. In an ideal world, they&#x27;d pick up CoffeeScript as quickly as HAML since in my experience, CoffeeScript creates very readable code, especially when the script makes heavy use of anonymous functions, sadly, it&#x27;s not always that simple. However, CoffeeScript debugging is a non-issue for an experienced JavaScript developer, CoffeeScript produces excellent JavaScript code that is easily understood. Individuals who like to minimize context changes can use sourcemaps.<p>Finally, dependencies for both tools are pretty trivial. I&#x27;m not sure how the author has managed to introduce 100 different gems into his project in order to support these tools, but it&#x27;s certainly not a requirement.<p><a href=""https://github.com/haml/haml/blob/master/Gemfile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haml/haml/blob/master/Gemfile</a><p>That&#x27;s like 4 gems for HAML.

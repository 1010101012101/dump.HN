There doesn't seem to be many best practices yet and so I'm trying to figure out how to do things like ensure database access is available without opening a connection to the DB every time and setting up everything I want to happen in that call back. So far talking to people the consensus has been to just open it and pass around an instance of it. There may be errors if you start receiving requests before the DB is opened, but it will be a short window for this to occur.

He was trying to convince that the carpet has not been pulled from below RIM's feet.<p>It showed that RIM doesn't really ""get"" it.

They are just like Nokia - except they believe they have no problems.<p>Sure Blackberry has the best security architecture, it has never had security issues until they started using WebKit, lots of people still use it. There is no denying that. What is problematic is that those things do not matter in the battle that RIM is fighting against Android and iOS. No sane Joe with a dumb phone is going to find BB compelling for his smart phone upgrade. It's just not cool.<p>What RIM needs is a dual OS/dual hardware strategy - let the BB folks keep doing ""Pro"" phones like they do today with BB OS. Let a fresh hardware and software team look at producing great consumer phones with a consumer OS.

Even someone who doesn't know a thing about programming can generally pick up how the interview is going from the candidate's reactions.  But occasionally someone would quite confidently assert some code would do something I didn't think it did, but I didn't really have the powershell chops to call them on it.  For a sysadmin position, there was no one language we could standardize on, and the interview was designed more to test ability to use one's tools, not to program, so it was the best we could do.  We weren't going to make every candidate learn perl/python/ruby just to apply.<p>A dev candidate who solves a problem in clojure may be impressive, but since I'm less qualified to judge, I will be less confident hiring them.  Your best chance to get hired is to convince me that you are better than everyone else, and the best way to do that is to do something impressive that I can compare to everyone else.<p>I've also had people go from passing to failing because they overreached.

This Lagrange multiplier is the momentum.<p>Of course, no one in a physics course actually learns it that way; undergraduates just memorize some equations and graduate students, if they are lucky, learn if from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (which is how Hamilton developed it in the first place) where the momenta become the spatial gradient of the function to be minimized when evaluated at all positions.

The phrasing of 'the problems you've had in terms of security' is seriously misleading and very poorly worded. I guess I've never seen the behind the scenes legal voices jump in before, but clearly, that question is baiting (unless RIM has some security issues I'm unaware of).<p>On the other side, cool that the BBC posts this for all to see, rather than just hiding it away somewhere.<p>Though for the general public who don't know if RIM has a security flaw or not, what effect does something like this have??",1302710629

Rather, by default, the generator spits out CoffeeScript templates. If you don't want to use CoffeeScript, don't use CoffeeScript and write regular JavaScript instead.<p>Will this confuse new users? Probably not, since the template file is going to include instructions and an explanation. Will the change break any existing sites? I really doubt it.<p>In the end, encouraging a better default language is a great change. New users are already required to learn to write ERB/Haml to make a Rails app; this is no different, and easily ignored if you're not interested.",1302710580

Our tiny startup is interested in adding some HTML5 structure using Modenizer etc but the main problem is the associated effort for not much return <i>yet</i>. It's really a balancing act for time - unfortunately IE7 and IE8 [and <i>gasp</i> IE6] are still hugely prevelant - so it's still 'the same old same old' by having to detect browsers and support multiple scenarios for HTML4 or HTML5. At this stage, until IE7 and IE8 die out ""more"" - which we certainly hope is in Q4 by end of this year - we will seriously look at integrating HTML5.<p>It's a real - ""improve existing server-side code / optimisation and feature bundle"" vs. ""add HTML5 support where needed"".

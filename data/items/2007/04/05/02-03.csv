9032,comment,8891,8891,0,0,staunch,,,"If this took them a short amount of time then it's clearly worth the effort. If they spent a lot of time then it seems frivolous and makes me think they may be avoiding working on the mundane issues that clients would find truly useful.<p>Making boring work more interesting can produce amazing results but it can also be a huge distraction. Either way this is definitely clever and the concept is probably applicable to all sorts of other features.<p>P.S.<p>I still think DabbleDB needs to seriously consider Joe Kraus's reasoning for why he ""positioned JotSpot as a Wiki company"". Because I think this ""web database"" concept is suicidal.<p>",1175741280

S3 is a robust , reliable, and easy way to handle the intial ramp up should hoards of users sign up, a concern I raised in another post. You probably have plans to get onto your own backend in the long-run.",1175741038

9029,comment,8863,8901,0,0,jganetsk,,,"Well there doesn't seem to be a GDrive at the moment... but there are many other similar online storage solutions.<p>Techcrunch had an article with 13 of them...\n<a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/31/the-online-storage-gang/"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/31/the-online-storage-gang/</a><p>It's a pretty crowded space. And XDrive gets you 5 GB for free, 50 GB for $9.95 a month. I can't expect Dropbox to charge those prices, given S3 as a backend. The margin just isn't really there, especially given the number of uses that will want free storage. And I think competitors can duplicate Dropbox's nice front end. In fact, here's an open source front end to SVN which is similar to Dropbox's:<p><a href=""http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a><p>Sorry for all the negativity, I guess I'm trying to play devil's advocate here.

I personally do. <p>Fortunately for me I had great English teachers in high school that designed their classes around effective communication rather than fancy writing. I still drop them an email every now and then to get their advice on how I could communicate a given idea more effectively.<p>Other than that I love Orwell's paper on English(<a href=""http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm)"">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm)</a> He makes great points that every blogger can learn from.<p>-Zaid\n",1175740200
9024,comment,8863,8884,0,0,BrandonM,,,"You might want to check out FUSE for Linux.  There are various programs built on top of it which allow remote filesystems to look exactly like local ones.  Two that I use are curlftpfs and sshfs.  It's really nice to be able to perform any of my computer's programs on these remote files, and it looks very similar to what Dropbox accomplishes.  Of course, you would need to have an FTP or SSH login somewhere, but you can get free FTP access from e.g. Lycos, so that shouldn't be an issue.<p>In short, I guess I'm curious what separates Dropbox from using a free FTP service which is connected either through Windows' built-in Network Places or Linux's curlftpfs.  There are obvious differences, but are they enough to warrant fees?",1175740131

9020,comment,8956,8956,0,0,schoudha,,,"If your speaking about Facebook's API then that the decision on whether to use it is highly dependent on the purpose of your site. Personally, I would think very carefully before branding your site as a Facebook addon. <p>You might be referring to Thrift. In that case, it's only useful if you want to do cross-language services. I don't think an early-stage startup needs this sort of architecture but I guess designing for scale never hurts. <p>\n",1175739661

9017,comment,8848,8848,0,0,shbrown,,,"It would depend on the job I was trying to hire them for. But if I had to choose, I would choose ability to implement over having high-level ideas. That's my job anyway, and honestly I believe execution is more difficult than having high-level ideas.  <p>In practice, I try and hire people that have blogs wherein they showed knowledge as well as serious and deep thinking about the type of problems I want to hire them to solve. <p>The only person I've ever truly thought did an excellent job I hired this way. I didn't know him. I didn't look at a resume. I had one conversation with him. I just read his blog, and I could tell from his writing that he would do a good job. Actually, his blog was just his fiction writing and he was a UI designer and coder but I could still tell from his thinking. He was so smart--a structured, logical, deep and creative thinker. It was clear to me that he would do a good job. He did. I tend to be a perfectionist, and he was the only person I've ever hired that did a perfect job. I had absolutely no criticisms about him. He always exceeded my expectations. It was amazing. I love working with the best people--nothing is more fun.  <p>If they didn't have a blog, I'd tell them to write down their thoughts every day for a few weeks and then I'd read it. I believe that you can't tell anything about anyone except how they behave over time. People lie and misrepresent themselves. But it's pretty much impossible to misrepresent yourself over a period of time. <p>I might try and give them a few of my problems to work on as well. But, if someone isn't the quickest thinker and can't answer a problem I give them in an hour-long interview I really don't care. What if they're amazing problem solvers but they just take overnight? One of the smartest people I know is like this. <p>With a blog, or writing over time, you also get a sense of how well they can articulate their ideas--if they have amazing ideas but they can't articulate them well, then the quality of their ideas doesn't matter. If for some reason they're terrible writers but still smart, you can just have them create a podcast. If they can't do either, then they can't articulate themselves enough to be useful to a company.<p>Watching their thinking over time, you can see how many ideas they generate, since you don't just want people that will only solve the problems you have. You want people that see things you can't and generate ideas themselves. <p>I don't care about how well people fit in. A start-up isn't a clique of best friends, although you certainly need people that you can be bluntly honest with and can be bluntly honest with you. It's better if you like them, of course, but I'm never trying to build any kind of culture except a culture of excellence--well, excellence on deadline. <p>Another thing I've always wanted to try is just to hire someone for two weeks and give them non-critical tasks to do. I could see if they met deadlines and how they actually worked. The best way of finding out if someone can do something is to watch her do it. <p> \n",1175739349

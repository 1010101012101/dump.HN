5346576,comment,5345413,5345413,8,0,rubyrescue,,,"highly recommend runit + monit. The beauty of runit is the ./run script is easy to run by hand to test. The beauty of monit is it can watch things like http urls and ports, and if something goes wrong, monit executes sv down myservice; sv up myservice. (sv is the actual launcher-thingy of runit)<p>If you use monit without runit, you end up in this weird world where monit starts and stops things in a very odd environment and it's flakier, environment variables are missing, etc. Also monit takes a long time to notice things are down, and doesn't start things right away on boot.<p>Finally if you don't boot your services with monit, you booted them with something else meaning that when a restart occurs, you're starting a service in a different environment than you booted in. weird.<p>so, let monit check health of things, let runit start and stop things.",1362787166

When someone's sealed box has a defect, if you know what you put in the box, your troubleshooting and repair scenarios are vastly reduced compared to letting the consumer into the box. To a normal consumer, knowing that they could have upgraded their tower doesn't just give them more upgrade anxiety, it also convinces them that they're being ripped off while the smartass kid down the street is not. The sealed box is the ultimate equalizer.<p>I think all your points hold, I'm just saying there are a few somewhat less cynical explanations that may also apply.",1362787139
5346571,comment,5345538,5346027,3,0,tikhonj,,,"It's a pretty simple idea: we create the AST by assembling a function taking the environment and producing a result. We're creating a function of type<p><pre><code>    Environment -> Int
</code></pre>
It happens that there is a very simple way to combine functions like this. In particularly, if we have the following functions:<p><pre><code>    f :: Environment -> a
    g :: a -> (Environment -> b)
</code></pre>
we can ""sequence"" them by threading the environment through, giving us a function of type<p><pre><code>    h :: Environment -> b
</code></pre>
This function can be defined like this:<p><pre><code>    h environment = g (f environment) environment
</code></pre>
Basically, we first pass the environment to the first expression, get its result and then pass both that and the environment into the second expression.<p>Hopefully this is pretty intuitive: all we're really doing is letting both functions read from the environment. This happens to be called the ""Reader"" monad, and this sequencing action is bind (>>=).<p>The other thing we need for this to be a monad is a function called return which just embeds a value. In this particular case, we just have a constant value that ignores its argument, so:<p><pre><code>    return x = \ _ -> x
</code></pre>
Now we specify how different base expressions can be derived from their environments. A numeric literal just ignores the environment and returns itself, so that's just return:<p><pre><code>    number = return
</code></pre>
A variable looks itself up in the environment. If it doesn't ignore, it uses a default value of 0. Put another way, we want to find the name in the environment with a default of 0, so we just write:<p><pre><code>    variable = findWithDefault 0
</code></pre>
This is using point-free code quite a bit. Once you get used to it, you'll find it's more readable because it's simpler; however, for a beginner, it might be clearer to writ the arguments out explicitly:<p><pre><code>    variable name = \ environment -> findWithDefault 0 name environment
</code></pre>
We can also see how the `variable' function produces the type of value I was talking about before: it reads from an environment.<p>Now on to operators. Essentially, we want the operators add and mul to take two values reading from an environment and string them together as above after adding/multiplying them. This happens to correspond to a very common monadic function called liftM2; you can read the name as ""lift a two-argument function to operate on some monad m"".<p>Finally, when we put everything together, expressionTree becomes a function which takes an environment and strings it through a series of operations, giving an Int result at the very end. We can then just print this result given an arbitrary environment.<p>I hope this cleared things up and maybe gave you some intuition about why we care about monads.<p>Looking at some of the other solutions: the Haskell version is the same general idea as the some of the other solutions using functions, like pmarreck's (which is just a couple of posts above it). The main difference is that it uses some more general functions to make all the env plumbing implicit and pretty.",1362787137

What is the max they can realistically expect to get back from Heroku? $250K? $500K? Surely not the entire $20K/mo, so I doubt it will be that much.<p>Given all the money they have raised so far, if I were one of their investors I would start to ask questions about if they are wasting their time frivolously beating a dead horse.<p>This is getting into 'bad karma' territory.

I don't really know what to feel when it comes to the Mac Pro anymore. I used to compile WebKit a lot, and it takes forever (change one .h file and go get some lunch while you wait). When I got my Mac Pro 2 years ago it compiled it in under a minute I think. It was incredible. The best part was, back then, Xcode had the distributed builds feature, so I could go anywhere in my apartment with my Macbook Air and compiling was still crazy fast since the work was offloaded to the Mac Pro's 12 cores on my home network. Then they removed that feature from Xcode. I also had a two monitor workflow, but then they broke (for me) dual display support with Lion. The Mac Pro also doesn't support the latest and greatest graphics cards, so its not worth it in my opinion to upgrade them for Cinema 4D or games.<p>I don't even know if I mind really. The reality is that for the last 3 or 4 years, it feels like Apple has more and more been pushing me to not really love the computer experience anymore. When I think about my next ""big"" purchase, I will probably build a PC. I have never done that before in my life. I've exclusviely owned Mac. But ""leaving"" Mac OS X doesn't seem like a big deal to me anymore. I'll just be trading one set of frustrations (Messages, Notification Center, 5 minute long sleep wake up times, endless WiFi issues, etc) for another. At least I'll actually have fast graphics.<p>And Xcode will suck on my Macbook Air the same way it sucks on my Mac Pro today, so no real loss there, since I don't compile WebKit anymore. Again, its mainly just indifference now. I don't know if I miss the days when this stuff was fun, but Apple has certainly finally succeeded in making me see their computers as just tools.",1362786184

Here they've lost the tree for the forest! They know what hash table is, at least at a high level, but forget that it has specific implications.<p>A lot of advice I've read about interviewing suggests that a candidate should leave answers open and provide room for the interviewer to poll for more info.  I'm curious to know if the author goes out of their way to poll about the specifics of the hash table implementation?<p>In fact, one of my favorite interviews in recent memory was a hash table discussion not unlike the one the author is hoping for.  I was happy to find an interviewer whose questions balanced theory with practice and was happy to drive to a solution with them.  However, I wouldn't have offered up this analysis without first understanding that this is where the interviewer wanted to drive the discussion.  Every good programmer knows that premature optimization is the devil.<p>The author may instead be trying to raise the point that its up to the discretion of the interviewee to see that the hash table implementation is the critical performance detail. e.g. gotta do open addressing here b/c our hashing function has weird edge cases where it collides all the time and chained hash would bring us closer towards a log(n) traversal on that edge case.<p>However, in my limited interviewing experience, interview problems such as this are often designed to be open-ended conversation rollers moreso than where implementation specifics like this are able to jump out easily.",1362786057

Your distinction between ""the economy"" and ""the culture"" doesn't make much sense.  They're basically different names for the same thing: what we do, how we do it, and what effect it all has.<p>2. You claim that: ""you cannot have infinite economic growth like the author advocates, when you population is dwindling"", yet that is precisely what efficiency gains are all about.  In fact, ever-greater efficiency combined with limited natural resources contraindicates perpetual population growth.<p>3. Your diatribe about ""fertilizer"" and the ""green revolution"" directly contradicts your thesis.  If we're going to run out of fertilizer, and we shouldn't look to technological solutions, then how are we going to feed all these new people?  Kindness to your fellow man lasts only as long as both of you have food to eat.<p>4. You then go on to say: ""more technology and better ran economy is not the solution.""

Finally, your masterwork: ""the cultures that reach the growth that the author wants, are the ones that understand that they must work for future generations, not for themselves.""

Also, did state and local taxes not exist in 2000?  I would assume the tax and spending ratios would be close to the same.<p>Also, if the government got to do accounting the way businesses do, then they would be able to capitalize things like infrastructure costs.  But because our governments can't, transportation funds dry up and we end up with decaying infrastructure.<p>You seem to suggest I'm being deceiving here, but all I'm pointing out is this: We had a recession caused by the private sector.  As a result of this recession, tax revenue went down,  because taxes go down in a recession.  Spending also went up, because spending on safety net programs intended to mitigate recessions goes up.  And certain people, like yourself apparently, think this is an unprecendented catastrophe.

China is not going to knock on our door, throw a bunch of IOUs in our faces, and demand we pay up or they'll break our legs.  The figurative way this <i>could</i> happen is if our debt causes expensive borrowing costs or massive inflation.  Why don't we wait for either of those to start to happen -- none of which has happened in countries with much greater debt than US that control their own currency (as we do), like Japan -- before you throw the ""future burden of our kids"" argument out?<p><i>Even then the government was obviously bloated beyond all recognition, with government ""jobs"" that required little or no work being handed out as political favors.</i><p>I posted this link down below, but public sector employment has completely collapsed since the recession[0].

The idea of pure journalism, imo, of a story presented without artifice or bias, is an illusion.  A dry style with a linear presentation of facts shorn of judgement and opinion is itself an artifice.  It just happens to be an artifice that has, by cultural convention, branded itself as ""true"" and ""objective.""<p>I don't think recasting this story in such a style would have provided much new information or left me with a clearer picture of what had actually happened.

5346318,comment,5344987,5346114,4,0,nhashem,,,"I mentioned George W. Bush a single time.  I fully recognize the ""Bush did it too"" or ""Bush was worse"" is a poor political argument.  I also made my original arguments to be as factually based as possible and tried to avoid the usual partisan talking points, <i>since this is ultimately about economics, not politics,</i> and we have things like numbers and math to form lines of logical arguments with.  Statements like ""he's spent more than any person in the history of the world"" are just pure misguiding hyperbole at best, and completely false at worst.  In the 1940s, the federal deficit was <i>22% of GDP.</i>  In 2009, the federal deficit was 10% of GDP, and it hasn't been in double digits since.  At least amend your statement to, ""Obama has run bigger deficits as a percentage of GDP than any president not fighting Nazis,"" which would at least be accurate.<p>In any event -- all I'm saying is that I'm very much a ""deficit hawk"" in any condition where the Federal Reserve has to keep interest rates above.  Cut the deficit, offset the spending by lowering borrowing costs, so the private sector can borrow more cheaply for the purposes of growth.  Hooray!  The problem is when you have such a bad recession that borrowing costs are effectively zero, for the government and anyone else, and you still have high unemployment and no inflation.<p><i>You cannot go bankrupt if you print your own currency.</i>  You can always print more money, which is why Japan has no problems borrowing money at low interest rates even with a 250% debt to GDP ratio[0].  Yes, I know, ""OMG Weimer and Zimbabwe HYPERINFLATION!""  This is why the US government doesn't just print money, it issues bonds that the Federal Reserve buys by printing money, giving the Federal Reserve the ability to constrain said money supply if the economy recovers.  And by the way, if we have inflation, <i>that is a good thing,</i> as it means enough people have enough jobs and income that they are spending enough money.  If you can give me a scenario where we have inflation <i>without</i> full employment, I'd love to hear it.  the same people have been ranting about hyperinflation for years.  Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles presented their famous ""Simpson-Bowles"" budget in 2011, and prefaced it by saying the US needed to take these budget steps or else they would face issues with rising interest rates or inflation in about two years[1].  2011 was two years ago.  Hmm.<p><i>If Social Security needs to be a little means tested and the age raised, so be it. If Medicare needs to be means tested, age raised, or what have you... then so be it.</i><p>Let me get this straight.  Because some entities in our private sector did some really dumb (or malicious) things, and the resulting speculation bust led to massive unemployment, the solution is... cutting core government programs that had nothing to do with it?  And you want to do it by turning Social Security into a welfare program (bet it'll still be politically popular after that!) and by raising the age of Medicare, which means all the poor people that will actually need it will probably be dead, because even fewer of them will live to 67 or whatever age you want to raise it to.  And we need this to prevent ""financial collapse,"" even though countries with much more debt relative to us have not come anywhere near collapsing.<p>Yeah, we have a lot of useless bureaucrats in government.  But I'd love to see how much of our federal budget they actually take up, because it's probably not as much as you think.  I don't like my taxpayer money going to useless bureaucrats either, but it's a complete exaggeration that this is the reason why the US is on the ""road to ruin.""  In general, public sector employment is the lowest it's been in decades[3].  Apparently the man who has ""spent more than any person in the history of the world"" has not spent enough money to keep all those public sector employees employed.<p><i>If for no other reason, we have NO RIGHT to burden future generations with exorbitant debt.</i><p>Sadly, perhaps one of the biggest fallacies that usually comes up with the discussion.  As I gave in my example, because of Medicare, I don't have to pay for my parents to have health insurance.  If the government needs to tax me now or later because of that, I don't consider that a ""burden.""  I consider that something that has freed me to take greater capitalist risks in starting my own company, that should hopefully provide even greater gains for the country's economy.  And if we're spending too much on Medicare because we're spending too much on medicine in general, then we should solve <i>that</i> problem, not cut Medicare.  For a much more eloquent description of this concept, I refer you to Paul Krugman[3].<p>And that's all the time we have for today, ladies and gentlemen.  After I post this, I'll be editing my /etc/hosts file, as it's now 3pm, and I really need to get some work done.  Sadly, arguing economics on Hacker News doesn't grow our economy nearly as much as coding.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_deb...</a>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/03/08/bowles-simpson-fiscal-crisis-could-come-within-2-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/03/08/bowles-simpson-fisc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/american-austerity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/american-austeri...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/on-the-non-burden-of-debt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/on-the-non-burde...</a>",1362783601

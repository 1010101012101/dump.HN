Reach out to industry groups that your users are members of. Read their trade publications. Attend their conferences.

643070,comment,642254,642321,0,0,spyrosk,,,"I have thought about an ejection mechanism too. Maybe a combined system of ejecting small beacons and the main one, that stays in the plane, would work better. The beacons could be located in multiple locations on the plane, e.g. nose, tail, wings, and when an inevitable crash is detected they could start firing off at regular time intervals, depending on the altitude. If they are light-weight enough maybe some of them could be combined with an expandable helium balloon for easier spotting. Of course this requires having weather data available for the crash area so that one could deduct their starting position.\n(Disclaimer: I'm not an engineer so I don't know if my idea is stupid.)",1244203921

However, Redmine does a good job of hiding all the unused filters, and an even better job of not <i>looking</i> visually overwhelming.  Part of that has been improved recently with the new colorscheme for bug statuses, but there's still a lot that could be done.<p>Thanks again. :)",1244203602

Things will get really interesting, he thinks, when consumers “get away from the concept of the cell phone—that implies talk and listen” and new applications, based on sending data to and from mobile devices, take hold. There are already glimpses of the potential for mobile data in the success of the BlackBerry e-mail device and the iPhone, with its vast selection of downloadable software. But Mr Cooper feels strongly that such applications will be more likely to flourish if the world’s mobile networks, and the applications that run over them, are developed and managed by different companies, in an open model that mimics the internet.",1244203365

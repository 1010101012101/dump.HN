It doesn&#x27;t do the kitchen sink, like Angular does. A couple hours reading the spec and implementing a small test case gets a seasoned developer up to speed on it. Flux takes a little bit longer to get used to, though, and I&#x27;m still not quite sure I&#x27;m &#x27;doing it right.&#x27;<p>2. Coupled with webpack and an automated testing toolchain, development speed is quick. Webpack provides hot module reloading - no need to refresh your browser when you change a file. Very fast feedback loop. 3/3.<p>3. React with Flux provides a pretty strict but flexible guideline for how to build things. Discrete components, actions and data stores all look similar from a structured point of view. This provides a fantastic environment for unit tests. The favored test runner, Jest, provides automocking for dependencies and code coverage analysis. 3/3.<p>4. Virtual DOM for rendering performance. ES2015-oriented structure. Ease of testing. Enforcement of application structure without being a serious impediment. Warnings against implicit two-way databinding that can lead to disastrous cascading DOM changes. Good browser debug tool. On a purely subjective level, it &quot;feels like the future.&quot;",1438869514

Because just losing weight is extremely hard and it’s time we acknowledge that. And I’m not talking about the raw mechanics of losing weight here – those are easy and work with mathematical precision (well, ok, I myself may be generalizing too much here, but for me they did: if calories out minus calories in are equal to roughly 7000 I had lost 1kg, maybe ±.3kg, though that’s probably mostly due to the inherent uncertainties of estimating calories).<p>It’s about psychology and accusing people of playing the victim or trying to insult them to lose weight is just not a workable strategy.

I can input names myself to attach to the phone numbers I know, and pass them to a friend with a NFC tap or message, so I could potentially also do that for IP address numbers.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly want my ability to use the web controlled by ICANN as a single central authority, especially as I perceived the recent TLD sale as a blatant cash grab.  The central authority has to be trustable, and I don&#x27;t fully trust it.",1438868702

Even for a very simple task, if you literally didn&#x27;t think about how to solve it at all and just did the simplest thing to make each test pass, you&#x27;d never accomplish it. E.g., &quot;find the absolute value of a number&quot; would end up with a function like<p><pre><code>    abs(n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        if(n == -1) return 1;
        if(n == -3.5) return 3.5;
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
This is why testing is not a substitute for logical reasoning, but a complement; once we think we&#x27;ve solved a problem logically, we can test several cases to check our reasoning.<p>This is also why no amount of testing will make up for a program with no logical structure. For example, if you use unstructured GOTO as the only means of control flow, then you won&#x27;t be able to solve the resulting bugginess by writing more tests.",1438868054

It&#x27;s really hard to force a community in certain direction. It&#x27;s more about sowing the seeds with tools and ux  and less about policies and rules... and then apply a light touch help it develop in the direction you want.<p>There&#x27;s also a question of what the ultimate goal is. What&#x27;s best for the most users? For making the most money? The biggest median satisfaction? To fulfill some aspirational teneth?<p>I think one of Reddit&#x27;s fundamental problems at this size is that it is grown on the seeds of anonymity, user moderators and upvotes/downvotes.<p>It has served them well for a long time but chaos always ensues when a community reaches a certain threshold, and more pressure needs to be applied to keep it in check (if that&#x27;s what you want)<p>Upvotes/Downvotes is a blunt tool and threads easily changes into who agrees with whom rather than promoting thoughtful comments.<p>User anonymity is great, but requires features around it at a certain size. A country has borders to keep criminals away and community needs a way to keep trolls at bay. If you just can create another account what&#x27;s the problem with being a troll?  One remedy might be a smarter karma system where more visibility is given to users that&#x27;s posted interesting content, kinda lika slashdot.<p>User moderators are great when it works, like in some channels. But it&#x27;s also a source of petty power struggles and dictators defending their fiefdoms.  Reddit of course benefits tremendously from the work the &quot;power&quot; incentivizes these moderators do for free, but I keep wondering if at a certain size there needs to be more automation and checks and balances to avoid user moderators becoming destructive or slanted and put too much focus on the meta. Then again maybe some subreddits <i>should</i> be biased and let the mods rule as their will. It&#x27;s a little weird though for big general subreddits for things like news and countries.<p>Anyway, Reddit is probably too much set in it&#x27;s way to enact radical change without the users revolting, and there isn&#x27;t proof that the model doesn&#x27;t work, just that it has its problem, as all models probably would.<p>As I said, community dynamics are complicated.

Without a firm editorial grip, the flourishing of disreputable subreddits opened the door for BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, and others, which sift through Reddit content and repackage it to advertisers in more sanitized conditions. “Reddit is watching other people eat its lunch,” Erwin says.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I think this loses the magical thing Reddit has - extremely strong intent signals from millions of people who are constantly voting on these items.<p>An interesting route to monetisation for Reddit would be divorcing the hive mind from the more passive viewers. There are probably a sizeable number of people who really don&#x27;t care about the discussions / community interactivity element within Reddit and don&#x27;t even possess accounts. What if Reddit created an independent app which used the live data from all of these sub-reddit upvotes, comments, (sentiment analysis?) and the rate at which something got picked up to do their &quot;buzzfeed&quot;-esque curation? Reddit&#x27;s repackaging would create that neutral advertising-safe space, which could be successfully monetised in different ways.<p>An example of this would be say a deep-connect with content providers like Netflix and Hulu as well as whatever sub-reddits exist for movies, where they have a curated, passive viewing experience of say short-movies culled from a combination of Youtube, Vimeo, and Netflix to create a unique mix that wouldn&#x27;t exist anywhere else. This would create a constantly changing, dynamic &quot;TV-like&quot; experience. Some viewers would like to engage around what they&#x27;ve watched and then Reddit could close the loop and get more data. I&#x27;m sure there are other interesting things to do with all of the photos they have in their dataset. As well all the articles and user-submitted content. (a better Flipboard type app?)<p>Reddit the company doesn&#x27;t have to fight with reddit the chaotic force.

1. you&#x27;re constantly over tired, and working out or even walking when you&#x27;ve been woken up hundreds of times per night is hell. Someone with apnea can have 30 or more breathing &quot;pauses&quot; every hour, and all of those times, the brain wakes up in some capacity. You can go with years of that condition untreated. Imagine trying to work out every week with that amount of sleep deprivation.<p>2. The metabolism and appetite changes drastically. Instead of getting a break and waking up in the morning after a good night of sleep not needing food, you are constantly sugar crazy 24/7. You never get a break from the appetite and blood sugar mayhem. This makes it really difficult to change eating behavior.<p>The best solution is to get as many people as possible a CPAP machine so they can feel well rested and reset their system, and then they will have a much better starting point for losing weight. And yeah, you can be skinny as hell and still have sleep apnea, a bunch of people do.",1438866570

Other than that, there isn&#x27;t anything you have to prove as far as the companies go.

I have gotten variations of this answer and as long as it lines up with the resume (e.g. I don&#x27;t see an open source company etc) then it is plausible enough, and I don&#x27;t expect people to write code 24/7 so the fact they put it all into their employment and didn&#x27;t write extra stuff and publish it in GitHub is fine by me, long as they are competent.<p>As for your side business, if you are spending 2k/month in ads and getting 800% return, then you are pulling in revenue of around 16k a month.

(I graduated in Cultural Anthropology and did work with asylum seekers from Chechnya). I assume you&#x27;re serious about what you want to do, not just go-there-once and forget about it, so I also write dead seriously.<p>First of all - language and cultural differences. Don&#x27;t underestimate these. It&#x27;s a very false assumption that people all around the world share the same values, ideas and understanding. It could happen that you want to do something good, and they would treat it as patronising for instance and get offended. Mind the gender issues as well. And above all they are not at their best, on the contrary, they are scared, alienated, impoverished, tense... Not an easy crowd to get along with. You should have some professional to assist you, someone knowledgeble you could talk to.<p>Secondly - I have been teaching Hebrew to a small group of people for free. The average age is +30, all persons university graduades, and they DO want to learn. But because there is no fee, they simply don&#x27;t come to classes, don&#x27;t do the homework! I could not have made it easier for them - I made all the materials, put them online and send them by e-mail, recorded readings in mp3, printed the handouts and brought paper and pens to the classes so that everyone is equipped. It doesn&#x27;t work. They don&#x27;t come regularily, they don&#x27;t work at home. My mother, a psychologist, laughed at me and said that I have to charge for the classes and even take a collateral from them that will be returned only under the condition that they have 90% attendance and do homework. I don&#x27;t know about asylum seekers, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised they completely ignore you (not in bad spirited manner). This also happens with the language, the Chechens I worked with simply did not learn at classes. The result was a TOTAL FAILURE. Again, it&#x27;s not their fault, I don&#x27;t mean that. The system was broken. It&#x27;s not enough to just come and teach.<p>Thirdly - I assume you will be dealing with adults. Adult education is very much different than teaching children. It&#x27;s not the good place to elaborate on that, but the basic principle is that you have to rely on these people&#x27;s previous experiences, concepts, ideas. They are adults, so they are not &quot;blank pages&quot; to be filled in with knowledge, they will not easily accept everything you say. They have their own ideas, thinking patterns, views, so you have to often ask questions such as: &quot;What does it remind you?&quot;, &quot;Does it look familiar?&quot;, &quot;Have you ever encountered...&quot;, &quot;How do you understand...&quot;. Asking these questions seems like slowing down the teaching process, but this is adult education - you will not go around these issues, as people will start telling you their experiences and thoughts anyway, and if they do it on their own, it will mean &quot;I am not dumb, I also have my say, we&#x27;re equal&quot; rather than: &quot;He&#x27;s a really good teacher, I should share my views and see what he thinks&quot;. It&#x27;s tricky.<p>And finally - I am not sure if vocational training is what they really need. I might be wrong, but based on my experiences in Denmark and to lesser extent in Berlin, all the programs that we had for immigrants failed miserably (again, please, I don&#x27;t mean anything bad, I blame the system, no the poor people who were forced to migrate). It most often shows that the best we can do is to get them housing, some money, and really focus on providing excellent, inclusive education for their children. I know it&#x27;s harsh, but that&#x27;s what I have seen with my very own eyes.<p>My personal opinion, based on tens of interviews I had with the Chechens, Palestinians, Turks, Iraqis, Somalis and Sudanese is that they are deprived of the social aspects of life, not the economic ones. They look around and they can see you go to Starbucks, but they can&#x27;t. They can&#x27;t go to a store, to the movies, to read a book, drink tea and enjoy themselves. They cannot take a phone and call a friend to chat and gossip, organise a party or put on nice cloths and make-up. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really painful when you are surrounded and immersed in out consumptionis culture. They want to have a share in that as well. You could say, well, first you have to work, then you can play and have fun. But it is VERY possible thay they will never get to the point when they can earn for similar consumption of goods and culture. And then they are doomed to misery, poverty, and all bad stuff you hear on CNN.<p>I don&#x27;t want to discourage you from teaching programming. It&#x27;s a great idea. But I just want to draw your attention to that maybe it would be nice to take them to a park, drink coffee, cook together, learn their names and pronounce them properly (very important), learn a few phrases in their languages, encourage your friends to also build social relations with them,<p>tl,dr: be interested in them as human beings.<p>(p.s.: in general the demographics of the migrants is an interesting topic in its own right, I think that those who seek asylum in Europe these days are often from the &quot;middle class&quot; in their countries of origin, often more progressive, more open-minded, better educated than the general &quot;Western-White&quot; public thinks. It&#x27;s the long cultivated view of the alien &quot;barbarian hordes&quot;. Some of them will do very well - if they had a grocery in Bagdad, they will manage in Stockholm. If they were accountants back in Egipt, they will open offices in Birmingham. These will not need to learn to code and start from scratch).",1438866273

10016063,comment,10012499,10014283,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re doing a bottom-up analysis<p>Didn&#x27;t you? I thought I made it clear in my post. My post wasn&#x27;t about the level of debt (as I referenced in the post, it&#x27;s $35k for 2015), it&#x27;s about the financial burden of studying, which may look not so significant when you see $35k debt, but hides the notion that it&#x27;s because college students do more than we expect of them.<p>For example, where I live we have 36 weeks of college. (I&#x27;ve read in the US it varies, but can be 30 weeks, e.g. when you have semesters of 15, or trimesters of 10 weeks). But let&#x27;s say 36. Also we have 1800 hours of studyload here (i.e. european study credits are valid and recognised everywhere in the EU, and they&#x27;re about 30 hours of studyload each, and you need 60 per academic term, or 1800 hours).<p>So now we&#x27;re looking at 1800 / 36, or 50 hours dedicated to education per week. That&#x27;s how our education is planned and designed. Again it doesn&#x27;t mean students practically put in that time, but that&#x27;s the design, which means if they do less than that, then there are consequences.<p>Then you add the fact that there is variation among studies, some are easy and you can get away with spending less than that without affecting your learning, some end up harder than average (often the studies we want to steer people to) and can require more than that base level figure of 50 hours.<p>Then consider you need to work 2 or 3 days extra part-time, and we&#x27;re looking at a ridiculous burden on students. And you still end up with tens of thousands in debt, going up by $150 every month due to interest alone, on average.<p>And that, I&#x27;d think, has consequences, and I already mentioned that I see and saw this among my peers. I saw people who spent more time working than studying. I saw people pick easy majors so that they could get a degree without having to dedicate more than normally considered full-time on just studying, and then work besides it. I saw people simply choose not to study. And all of these things likely reduce the debt figure to $35k. i.e. I think if we made university 100 times more expensive, the debt figure wouldn&#x27;t change radically, not even by 10x, because people change their choices.<p>And yes I do think the things I mentioned above are a waste. I&#x27;m not saying working a job is a waste per se, you&#x27;re misunderstanding. I&#x27;m saying spending more time working than studying (not in an office by the way, we&#x27;re talking about a cafe or nightclub for most students where I live), choosing an easy major, not studying because by design your studies require you to spend 50 hours, and you can&#x27;t manage that while also working). That&#x27;s a waste.<p>And then it pays off to do a bottom-up analysis, the costs and opportunity costs of studying are $80k on a 50% scholarship? And people end up with just $35k debt? Then you can wonder how that affected their studies, if they needed support from parents etc.<p>> I personally think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable that people should work at least part-time to pay for their education and it&#x27;s been happening for generations<p>Oh to some extent I think it&#x27;s reasonable. I think you&#x27;ll also agree with me to some extent the work-next-to-study we require of some isn&#x27;t reasonable, and that for some it is a waste, for some it does negatively affect their education, for some it does create burn outs and depressions and suicide, for some it does prohibit them from studying all together, and that the $35k figure makes it look as if student financial burdens aren&#x27;t all that bad, more than it should. That&#x27;s my point and I think we can agree on that as much as I agree with your point that some part time work is reasonable, and can often be very beneficial.",1438866091

This was long before phones were built in to the dashboard so there wasn&#x27;t as much of a requirement for security, once you are inside the car the diagnostic connector will give you access to the whole network anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t know of a read-only CAN controller, plus not all data values will be periodically broadcast over the vehicle network so you may need to be able to send out a request for something as well as listen for a reply. The standard firewall tools ought to be easy enough to adapt to filter CAN messages.<p>The first time I updated ECUs over the air would be over 15 years ago, I have not kept up with whether manufacturers were thinking of doing it routinely.",1438866022

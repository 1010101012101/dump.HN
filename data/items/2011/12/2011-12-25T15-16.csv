Despite the syntactic and historic link, they are pretty much different languages(as is clojure). Although scheme is a descent intro to lisp-like languages, and racket is an awesome environment, both for teaching, and probably for actual work(haven't done any in it, so I’m only speculating about this), one piece of advice to those who chose to start with it is to keep in mind that scheme is only one way to look at what lisp is(and IMHO not the most enlightening or useful one), and its important to know what assumptions its creators made about what programming should be like.<p>As I pointed out in a comment at the beginning of the thread, scheme teaches you some habits that don't translate well to other lisps, so to those thinking of picking it up, be mindful of the assumptions of the language, and when you decide to look into other lisps, don't assume they will be the same there as well.<p>In fact i would actually recommend learning clojure or common lisp before scheme.

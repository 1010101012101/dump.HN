To people who don't know the industry well, this might not be easily differentiable, but the reality is that the two come from fundamentally different lineages.<p>The thing that sells gaming platforms is not ""natural progression into the living room"", not an ""upgrade cycle"", not ""development tools"". It's the <i>games</i>.<p>If Apple takes a similar approach to living-room gaming as they took to the iPhone, with an open development platform, or an ""Apple TV"" that plays games, but is not primarily focused on games, you'll see roughly the same quality of games come out there as on the iPhone. And notice how no iPhone apps sell for more than 99 these days.<p>Apple has no history of game development. It's not a part of their DNA. And the gaming industry is a difficult business to succeed in. So to take any other approach would be monumentally difficult for them.<p>The biggest threat to console gaming is not Apple. It's the consoles themselves.<p>Consider the case of the iPhone vs. handheld consoles. The iPhone was released in the heyday of the Nintendo DS. The DS sold like hotcakes throughout its lifecycle, and didn't slow down at all even as the iPhone's app store exploded onto the scene.<p>It was only once the 3DS came out that handeld consoles started to have difficulties. Of course <i>now</i> everyone starts blaming smartphones for taking the market away from them, but look at the console: it has a lineup of games that's mediocre at best, it focused on 3D features that nobody cares about, it had hardware flaws like a terrible battery life, and it was very expensive at launch. No wonder it disappointed.<p>If consoles end up failing, they will fail on their own merits. It won't be because of an app store.",1360785519

5215284,comment,5215017,5215250,5,0,shmerl,,,"You should probably consult a lawyer who deals with defense against such patent racket. But one practical approach could be to pool resources with others who were threatened by them. Most racket victims don't have enough resources to fight on their own, but if they unite - it can be easier to fight back. Trolls usually threaten many parties, so you should research who else is affected and contact them to build your common course of action.<p>Validity of patents requires research, even if you think they are ""valid"" it doesn't mean they are really valid. If prior art exists - the patent can be busted. But research requires time and resources, and that's where pooling can help if you have many interested parties united.",1360785470

Follow the internal WebKit politics and you see a lot of conflicts. For example, Google wanted to push multi-VM support (for Dart) and Apple blocked that.<p>> WebKit is already a de facto standard<p>On <i>mobile</i>. Mobile isn't everything.<p>Also, should we have said ""ie6 is already a de factor standard and given up""?<p>> I think one this is clear already: WebKit has completely and unequivocally won mobile at this point. They are nearly the only rendering engine used on the vast majority of mobile browsers, including the soon-to-switch Opera Mini/Mobile browsers too. There is no reason to worry about a slippery slope, the slope has already been slid down. In order for any other browser to remain relevant in the world of mobile (which, you must admit, is quickly becoming the only world we live in) they must keep feature parity with WebKit.<p>Again, this is utterly defeatist. Even if it were 99% true, should everyone give up?<p>> At this point its honestly a business/engineering decision for Mozilla and Microsoft (as it always has been).<p>No, Mozilla is a nonprofit and the decision would also regard whether it is <i>good for the web, or not</i>. I'm surprised to see John Resig not realize that - he used to work at Mozilla.<p>edit: And regarding the main point: jQuery worked in a space that was not standards-based. There were multiple JS libraries, and they fought for market share. No one tried to develop a standard that there would be multiple implementations for. Comparing jQuery to WebKit is odd.",1360785437

It was slow and tedious to do in Excel because it involved repetitive plotting of similar data.<p>I put my data into Access, then accessed it using R via ODBC. The cost was the time to validate my data and get it into a database. The benefit was that subsetting and plotting the data became very straightforward, and the source of error was the query and plotting script. Transposition, highlighting the wrong cells, not pasting the correct data, etc were eliminated as sources of error.<p>Plotting via a script is to plotting by hand in excel what using a computer is to photocopying, cutting and pasting physical paper.<p>Repetitive plotting and storing data: tasks for which excel is not really designed.",1360785427

Fewer people, more streets => not as clogged.<p>I pulled up a section of Harrisonburg's Main street, at some arbitrary time during the day:<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=S+Main+St&daddr=N+Main+St&hl=en&ll=38.44559,-78.872695&spn=0.020705,0.032015&sll=38.434195,-78.875012&sspn=0.020708,0.032015&geocode=Fal8SgIdBWNM-w%3BFUDFSgIdXZVM-w&oq=S+Main+St&mra=dme&mrsp=0&sz=15&t=h&z=15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=S+Main+St&daddr=N+Main...</a><p>I counted 54 cars in use in that 1.5 miles/2.4km stretch.<p>The main road through town is US-19. In the section where it meets S-Main to N-Main I counted another 31 cars, though I think a few of them are parked. Almost all of these are private vehicles, and I presume with 1-2 people in the car.<p>That's about 85 cars per 1.5 miles, and probably around 100 people using the roads.<p>In Venice, I started with Ponte Scalzi, by the train station. There were 45 boats in use by the Ponte de Rialto and about 81 boats in total by the time I got to the end of 1.5 miles (by Ai Leoncini). This puts the traffic density at about the same. Boats are both bigger, slower, and don't have brakes, so this isn't a great comparison, but we're using your metric.<p>Of these 81 boats, at least 10 were vaporetti. There's easily 4 times as many people on the Grand Canal as there are on Main St. and US-19 combined. If they each used a 1-2 person boat then the boat traffic and corresponding need to dock a boat would be that much higher.<p>Take a look at Harrisonburg's downtown. See how much of it is dedicated to parking? I reckon it's over 1/2 of the city center! Now, look at Venice. There's places for boats to park, but nowhere near as much space dedicated for that. That's because many people in Venice walk to work or ride the vaporetti.<p>I contend that the boat traffic in Venice is high. The damage from ship wakes and propellers is well known. The problem is that it's so convenient to be able to go more than 5kt, and hard to say no to the 2 million cruise ship tourists who come in ships whose wake and pollution affect the lagoon and air, when the damage is slow to become apparent.",1360784514

The density argument only makes sense if the mean is representative, which it isn't.<p>Much more typically you're looking at suburban feeders into urban centers. Even (in)famously suburban place like metro LA clock in at around ~200 people per square km[1], which isn't quite like the UK, but isn't far off.<p>The problem with American cities isn't <i>how much</i> space we use, it's how we use it. Meandering, twisting, turning streets present enormous transportation obstacles to anything that isn't a car, where grid-based layouts facilitate cycling and walking.<p>There is this curious, and somewhat crazy, notion that Europeans live all stacked up on each other in some imagined urban paradise (or hell, depending on who you ask), and Americans live in some sparsely-populated wilderness.

See above for my suggestion about how to change the starting offset in the original simulation, which clearly shows that the effect is reversed for different offsets.<p>Response to this edit:<p>> Wait, hold on. The problem is not with the theory, it's with your code. You're requiring a match between two values n and n+1 at once. That undermines the basic idea. To make your code work and imitate nature, you would need to take separate sums for n and n+1, not together as in your example, just as though there were two organisms, each trying to match up with the cicada's reproductive cycle. BTW my Python program sums values with an arbitrary change of starting point, but separately. Your code above has an obvious bug.<p>I am just setting the starting <i>offset</i> (not the starting <i>year</i> as I think you are doing in the Python program) between the cicada and the predators to something other than zero. Lets assume as an example that the cicada cycle is 4 years and the predator cycle is 3 years.  At simulation year 0, there can be a variety of situations: at this year the cicada are mating, the next year the cicada are mating, in 2 years the cicada are mating, or in 3 years the cicada are mating. The same goes for the predators: at simulation year 0, the predators are coming, or the next year the predators are coming, or in 2 years the predators are coming. A proper simulation would consider all these possibilities. Your simulation arbitrarily assumes that at simulation year 0 both the cicada are mating and the predators are coming, i.e. the offset between the cicada mating year and the predator arrival year is 0 at the start of the simulation. By increasing the cicada cycle year by a fixed number, I am changing this arbitrary assumption to a different number of years to show that this assumption has a large effect on the outcome of the simulation. So while the change is minimal and perhaps not the most readable way to introduce this offset, the change I made does not introduce a bug.<p>> Well, I certainly got that wrong. I assumed without evidence that you were one of those who bridles at the thought of someone criticizing psychology.<p>No, I even think the problem is more widespread than psychology alone (though in psychology it is particularly severe), having seen first hand and heard second hand how science is conducted in other areas (especially those close to psychology).",1360783650

(The Righthaven entity has now lost cases right and left, and is  facing sanctions for its legal misconduct: <a href=""http://righthavenlawsuits.com/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://righthavenlawsuits.com/.</a>)<p>So it's not just that Bill Budge <i>won't</i> sue. It's that if he did, and asserted that his intent was always 'all rights reserved', he'd almost certainly lose. Defendants would have a strong, perhaps ironclad argument that upload to Github was implied permission for lots of copying/reuse/modification. (That is, you can't put something into a world-readable folder that by custom means ""download, share and improve me""  and then assert that's not what you wanted people to do.) And that goes doubly if Budge is on the free plan, that's reserved for 'open source' projects.<p>When informing people about <i>the letter</i> of copyright law, and the maximal interpretation often asserted by rightsholders and literalists/authoritarians, it's important to also communicate how copyright law is really practiced and interpreted by the courts, and reasonable people. Many of our era's emblematic companies and services -- including Github, Google, YouTube, and blogging -- absolutely depend on the more liberal, fuzzy, implied-permissions and reasonable-balances practice of copyright law.",1360783615

It's akin to a fall down drunk getting his 30 day chip, and announcing it to the world.<p>But Lehrer didn't sound like he was proud of his ""30 day chip"", just that he's starting to see what the road to wellness is going to take.  It's the first step in his making amends.<p>People can take what he offers and accept it, disregard it, chew him up and spit him on the ground, or whatever.  But at least he is offering something.

I do know a lot about Gecko. ;)<p>The issues that I've seen are basically endemic to every large C++ application I've seen, actually: shared memory being accessed via pointers from many different places, lazily computed values, shared global (or even just per-page in the case of intra-page parallelism) caches.<p>These are all reasonable things to do, so I'm hesitant to call them ""incorrect"", but if you want to design with parallelism in mind you have to either avoid them or carefully design around having low contention on shared resources, access to mutable shared resources protected by some sort of serialization mechanism, etc.<p>As a simple example, last I looked WebKit's CSS selector matching algorithm cached some state on nodes as it went (as does Gecko's).  That means that as things stand you can't do selector matching on multiple nodes in parallel because you can get data races.  This one instance can be worked around by deferring the setting of the cached bits until a serialization point, but you have to make sure you do this for every single algorithm that touches non-const members on nodes that you want to parallelize... And C++ doesn't really give you a good way to find all such, given ""mutable"" and const_cast.<p>Another example: When WebKit does layout-related things, it directly touches the DOM from the layout code, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do when you think about it.  But it does mean that it can't do layout in parallel with running JS that can modify the DOM.  For that you need to have layout operating on an immutable snapshot of the DOM.<p>As far as more info.... <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/servo/wiki/Design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/servo/wiki/Design</a> is perhaps a start for what we think we know about how this _ought_ to work.

Google finds numerous reports where the average American commute (not shortest, not longest..) at this time is currently 16 miles and 26 minutes each way.  I strongly resemble that datapoint.  I listen to audiobooks while driving and find a bit less than an hour a day of audiobooks is just about right.<p>160 miles is utterly mad in terms of time, also.

He has been doing the same process for a long time with no results and instead of questioning his approach he is playing the victim card.<p>He should step back and realize he can't compete at that level. I find that people that sometimes work at small companies tend to take on roles that they may not necessarily have been able to get otherwise. Once they are laid off, they expect to have the same job at another company. What is sometimes lost is that those companies may only hire for that role when the person has an MBA or a particular designation, etc. The person feels they should get the job since they have been doing it already.<p>Well, it just doesn't work that way. You can either keep smashing your head against the wall or just maybe go find yourself something else to smash your head against. In his case, instead of accepting that the jobs he is applying for he is perhaps marginally a fit for, I suspect he continues to apply even after seeing that he only meets perhaps 1 or 2 of the five criteria. Doing so is just stupid.<p>This person's story is the classic and simple case of using old methods of finding a job when these methods just don't work that well anymore. I find it amusing that with all the education that this person has, he doesn't realize that the old methods usually work in a very hot economy. A good classic that is always updated is the What Color Is Your Parachute? book. The approaches described in that book would likely get this person very good results once he starts realizing that he should be a little less ambitious to start in terms of what he is looking for and also change his attitude (ie. drop the victim mentality - nobody owes him anything).",1360782881

5215014,comment,5204967,5210435,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Given this imperfect world, it seems prudent to use technologies and idioms that mitigate the consequences of this imperfection to the best that we are able.<p>Assuming that methods which actually mitigate those consequences exist, and all other things being equal, this is true. In the use cases for which class-based object-oriented design is well-suited, all other things are not equal between class-based object-oriented design to support providing base functionality with overriding in subclasses and using functions that take functions as optional parameters to provide base functionality with per-call overrides, even before considering whether, when used for that purpose, the functions-as-parameters approach actually mitigates anything.<p>Particularly, they are not equal in that the class-based approach avoids repetition and makes it clear the unit the behavior is attached to, while the functional approach does not. The functional approach is obviously cleaner and clearer for per-function-call parameterization, while the OO based approach is cleaner and clearer (unsurprisingly) for per-object or per-class parameterization.<p>> Secondly, the OP claimed that OO design is generally superior to functional design because it's easier to support overriding of behavior and it's easier to override behavior.<p>I haven't been defending OPs claim, I've been criticizing your response which argued that functions-as-parameters was not merely as good but actually categorically superior to OO design for this purpose.<p>> Neither of these claims is true. In both cases, attention to detail is required.<p>""Attention to detail is required in both cases"" does not, if taken as true (which I have no problem with), refute the claim that these things are generally easier to support in OO.<p>> Additionally, when you do parameterize behavior using OO idioms such as template methods, the fact that parameterization is occurring has been obscured<p>No, its not. Inheritance is categorical rather than per-call parameterization, and so using it presents what is being done as exactly that. Using functional idioms for categorical parameterization either involves recreating class-oriented structures or conceals (and makes less DRY) the categorical nature of the parameterization behind per-call overrides.",1360782763

5214941,comment,5213241,5214045,33,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This comment captures a lot, perhaps not in the way Ken intended, but I feel compelled to respond.<p>Lets start with the thesis statement, <i>""The web is not open and becoming increasingly less so.""</i><p>On its face, this statement is not only false, it is painfully so. Sort of like saying the world is not round and becoming increasingly less so. To pretty much anyone they would say ""the world is clearly round, and its impossible to change that."" Similarly there is absolutely nothing standing between Ken, or anyone else, preventing them from building an entirely different ""web"" just like Tim Berners-Lee did back at CERN. So the definition of the word 'open' here clearly is needs some additional verbiage.<p>The next statement helps a bit, <i>""It's driven less by standards and more by de-facto implementations. Soon we can get rid of the standards committee and just talk to the implementers of webkit to define the 'standard'.""</i><p>This deliciously captures a debate that has raged for 30 years at least. ""Which came first, the standard or the code?""<p>Back when I was young and impressionable, the debate was something called the ""ISO 7 layer networking model"" and ""TCP/IP"". You see the international standards organization had decided that the world needed a global networking standard, and so they got their best standards engineers together to come up with what they gloriously christened the ""Open Standards Interconnect"" or OSI set of protocols. Meanwhile a scrappy bunch of network engineers and hacker types were in this loose knit organization called the Internet Engineering Task Force who were building networks that spanned countries and they wrote code and brought it to the meetings and debated stuff that worked well and stuff that didn't work well, and then everyone went back and wrote more code, Etc.<p>The forces of evil ignored the IETF and focused on the ISO working groups, since the latter were making <i>standards</i> and the former were just playing around with code.<p>As it turned out, working code tended to trump standards, and a process of debating changes to the system using working code vs debate using 'it should/it might' as opposed to 'version A does/ version B doesn't' meant that changes got made to standards based on a convincing argument that had never been tried or experienced in practice. The result was that the OSI standards had a lot of stuff in them to avoid issues that weren't issues, and were missing responses to things that actually <i>were</i> issues.<p>A number of people found the 'code first, standard later' methodology superior for that reason. Assuming that the code was available and unencumbered by patent or licensing restrictions. The latter of course became a much bigger problem when the focus switched to the IETF and the 'big guns' started their usual games.<p>My first response is then, ""open"" means anyone can implement and contribute new stuff. And by that definition the web is very open. However, since the community favors a implementation model over a theoretical standards model the 'cost' to influence change is you have to write code, as opposed to making a good argument. And that disenfranchises people without good coding skills.<p>The second part of this screed is prefaced with this: <i>""And I think even worse has been the wholesale discounting of plugins.""</i> Which speaks to the other side effect of ""open"" as in ""we don't make any boundaries we don't have to.""<p>From a mass adoption point of view, the more variability you have in an experience the harder it is to capture the larger audience. This is why cars and motorcycles are all driven in basically the same way, Televisions have 'channels' and 'volume' and browsers have an address bar and bookmarks.<p>The unification of the structure allows for mass learning and talking in generalizations that remain true without device specific knowledge. Can you imagine how hard it would be to write a driver's code if every vehicle had its own customizable UI and indicators?<p>So as a technology matures the variability is removed and the common practices are enshrined into the structure.<p>What that means in a practical sense is that if you're trying to push the envelope in such a mature technology you will face higher and higher resistance. However, you are always allowed to create an entirely new way of doing things.<p>This isn't the 'dark age' it's the post renaissance start of the industrial revolution. Except instead of widely accessible books we've now got widely accessible information and a de-facto portal for accessing it.",1360782095

It's more about how the version of OO embodied in Java warps your program designs in an awkward way. He presents functional languages as the antithesis of this because, well, they are. But it's certainly possible for an imperative language to put functions and data on the same level  Yegge's favorite language, JavaScript, is an imperative language that does this.",1360782060

Besides being exceptionally dedicated and cool guys, the service is genuinely good. It definitely solved our problem of going to production with something like Heroku. It's a lot more cost/performance effective and also (as mentioned in one of the comments) you have full access to your box if you need it!<p>When you know what's in the pipeline, it's even more exciting.

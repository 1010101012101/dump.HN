You're correct that if you already have enough money in the account to hold the position, you can continue to short sell.",1221875884
309664,comment,309033,309152,0,0,unalone,,,"I can't argue about the ripping off business: I am not nearly experienced enough with your history to argue that.<p>What I CAN argue is the user interface, because that's something I've got experience with. Yours is awful. You essentially emulate an old version of Office, which had a fairly terrible interface to begin with. It works because you can modify the toolbar to work with it, to add on. Your products look like Office with all the toolbars enabled. There is no acknowledgement that certain buttons are used more than others, no acknowledgement that such a thing as ""user flow"" exists. It's unoriginal and it is worse than the original design. This is not usable.<p>Your aesthetic is questionable. Brown and white in Writer is not pretty by any means. The fact that your UI changes with every product means that you lack consistency. Furthermore, in Safari there is severe clipping whenever rounded corners are involved. It looks about as pretty as a bad student project.<p>Google understands that the Internet has different requirements, a different medium than desktop apps. Their products are lighter than Office, not just in terms of features but in terms of aesthetic. They don't try and fail to emulate Office. They offer one that's more optimized for the Internet. With yours, I'm seeing vast increases in disk usage. That's poorly done.<p>Of course you have customers. You have a wide set of applications, and a lot of people will use anything that has a wide featureset without design. That doesn't mean you won't get criticism. Many people despair of the fact that there's so much attention on featureset and so little attention on good design. It's the 37signals crowd, I guess you could say. And that crowd looks down on Zoho as a symbol of what's wrong with web design right now.<p>I mean, don't get me wrong. Good luck with your site: you certainly do have a product that appeals to a particular market. I just wish you guys would put a little more effort into making something that looks and feels beautiful.",1221875753

Particularly:<p><i>Every single journalism class at NYU has required me to bring the bulky [New York Times] newspaper.</i><p>This quote gives me visions of the Toy Story ""Squeeze Toy Aliens"", each with a newspaper in their hands, waiting for a NYT Senior Editor to come down from the sky and take one lucky student to a better place.<p>This article is obviously working a specific perspective and could be projecting quite a bit of personal experience / opinion into things, but it speaks volumes about the situation the paper media finds itself in.",1221874862

The author of that weblog knows a lot about these issues since he has been helping people fight spam blogs for years.<p>I'm not talking about the rights of the weblog owners. I'm talking about the rights of the commenters on those weblogs. If you search for my comments on backtype, you get the full text of each comment. That goes far beyond fair use. You can search for any fragment of any of my comments on Google and it won't show you the whole comment, it only shows a (fair use) excerpt.<p>To be extra clear, you ""excerpt"" pages but you are not excerpting the individually-copyrighted comments. It is analogous to a website that republishes a book a page at a time and then claims that each page is a fair-use excerpt of the book.<p>Anyway, I don't see how you can say that your assertion is obvious when I've already explained the ways you compete with content publishers and content authors. Besides that, as the Plagiarism Today piece mentions, you compete in SERP placement since you let search engines index the content you plagiarize.",1221874735

309652,comment,309214,309542,0,0,unalone,,,"You used ""fanboy"" like a negative term when you referred to Gruber. The name has negative connotations. Here you dismiss him again by calling him a ""fanboy leader"" and generalizing against Apple users and Gruber readers. People read his stuff not because he constantly supports Mac, but because he's a good writer, he finds good links, and he tends to be pretty honest about how he feels. I read him before I was a Mac user, and it was the things that he pointed out that made me certain that I wanted a Mac. I don't think that's fanboyish of him, though: he honestly pointed out interesting stuff, and he never acts with a bias towards Apple, beyond the bias of them working well for him. If Apple does a bad job, he points it out.<p>I'm not digging your style, I must say. Comparing my point to Bill O'Reilly's style is pretty distorted. My point - that if a lot of smart people are also big Apple people, that Apple may actually be making the best products - is hardly irrational. I don't know why you've got a problem against Apple, or why you like tinting every lens in favor of Microsoft, but it's not pleasant and most of your posts have things in them that seem sneering towards things I genuinely like. Apparently your big web site is also a blog that got famous for being offensive, so that's no big surprise, but at the same time you'll forgive me from finding it a bit immature of you.<p>You think Microsoft only had three ads planned? You think they dropped only a single ad? Citation? And if they DID overadvertise Seinfeld for only a few ads, I'd say that was a bad move on Microsoft's part.",1221874352

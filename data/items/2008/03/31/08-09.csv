150881,comment,150794,150871,0,0,Tichy,,,"I thought it is probably pretty easy to write a LISP interpreter in Javascript (or a Scheme interpreter), so why not do that and have it execute your LISP code? I thought about that recently, when I took up Scheme programming again - so no, you are not alone ;-)<p>I assume it is easy to write such an interpreter because it is frequently an exercise in LISP classes, and I think it has been done many times before (for example I  think some games took that approach, using LISP as a scripting language).",1206953617

I think it has a better education system from primary to secondary, as outside of Kerala a lot of teachers are habitually absent.<p>India has higher barriers to entry in damn near everything because of the ""Licence Raj"" and <i>insane </i> employment legislation. Its almost impossible to fire people once your enterprise has more than 100 employees.<p>China has been experiencing the demographic dividend (falling birthrate means the dependency ratio drops, and you get a bulgein the population pyramid in the working age population, more taxes, fewer pensions and childcare)",1206953473

150873,comment,150776,150776,0,0,mixmax,,,"The cult of mac is really interesting when you see it from a business perspective. It is similar to a religious cult in many respects - A sense of being superior to others, near-total devotion to their god (sorry, couldn't resist...), ,the constant need to tell the world that their way is the only right way. And they have a charismatic leader.<p>This is what it is, and not all mac fans are like this - but many are. Whatever Apple puts on the market they will buy. And they will tell all their friends about it - whether they like it or not.<p>This has to be one of the best marketing ploys ever deceived by man, Apple has thousands and thousands of fanatical marketing representatives in coffee shops all over the world who are ready to tell everyone of the superiority of the mac. I think that this cult is a primary success factor for Apple, evidenced by the fact that under Sculley's reign at Apple shares fell, and Apple wasn't cool. When Jobs came back he got the cult going again, and they are now heading for new heights.<p>It's absolute marketing genius...",1206952560

Just totally replacing javascript for dom interaction etc. with lisp. Is that insanity or have other people thought similar things?",1206952424

Revenue is always predictable and consistent in these services models that we have.<p>As you mentioned, revenue sharing/generation might not be so important for some people.

That's why modern languages detect typos and report them to the user.  Perl accepts most typos as valid and makes the programmer do the boring work of analyzing the syntax for correctness.<p>I'm bitter about wasting 30 minutes tracking down a bug because perl accepted 'if(!$string_generator1-() || !$string_generator2->()) {...}' as valid syntax.  This kind of thing happens to me very often when writing Perl programs.<p>I think that C++ and Perl are <i>very</i> different.  Perhaps their most important similarity is that they're both older languages.  At least C++ is making progress, while Perl seems to be embracing its backwardness.",1206952345

They also have no delays in registration: when I was at a talk by Randall Munroe, he mentioned a domain name he thought was funny.  3 or 4 people lunged for their laptops to register it, and despite me having to enter my CC# (I have to start leaving $10 in my account for such emergencies), I won it, even though everyone claimed to have gotten confirmation of a successful purchase.",1206951685

150864,story,,,5,14,bkrausz,"Ask HN: Autoposting script?",,"So as some of you may have noticed, the last 5 or so xkcd's posted have been by me.  I wrote up a little autoposting script at some ungodly hour and set it up in a cron to post new comics.  I am not doing this for the karma, since anyone looking at my submission history (which I assume YC would do) would notice the source of whatever karma I get.  I post because I figured someone would post the xkcd at some point anyway, and I may as well save people the time.<p>The issue is, I've seem enough negative reactions to warrant concern.  While nothing is preventing me from posting the latest comic manually each day, and considering xkcd's low volume I feel it's not a problem, I have no desire to piss anyone off.  I'm also curious about how the community feels about this practice.  So tell me HN: is such a practice (in the volume of 3 submissions a week) offensive?  If there are a significant number of upvotes on comments against me, I will stop this practice, but I feel that tasteful bots, when used in moderation, would make things easier and more efficient on HN, though I can definitely see a potential issue with it snowballing (i.e. posting every TechCrunch entry as someone previously suggested).<p>Also, how do people feel about the idea of having something like an xkcd bot account, that way no one in particular benefits from the karma gain?  While I recognize that most of us have xkcd in our readers, there are some who only want to view the interesting ones, which is what upvoting is meant to do anyway.<p>If anyone has been bothered by my use of an autoposter I apologize, I never meant to offend :).",1206951302

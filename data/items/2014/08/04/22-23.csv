Refactor mercilessly. Learn both ORM and SQL, understand the technology you&#x27;re working with.<p>The &quot;wide tables&quot; problem is easily addressed through &quot;associated data&quot; tables. Don&#x27;t store everything in the one model. You have one model which is for computation, searching, comparison, etc. You have another model which is for storage of stuff that is only required at report time. This is a ORM-level of &quot;partitioning&quot;. Just avoid &quot;fetch-related&quot; style ORM requests and you&#x27;re golden.<p>It&#x27;s really worth reading whatever references are available on tuning your particular database for performance. You can take the advice onboard and let the performance advice contribute towards your ORM design.<p>The SQL-templating approach is tempting, but it will very quickly lead to problems as someone adjusts a template and adds or removes parameters. Do you have tests in place to ensure that the SQL templates still function as expected? How tightly bound is your SQL to one particular vendor&#x27;s product? Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt. Did you know that MySQL will automatically update the first TIMESTAMP column any time that row is updated? It doesn&#x27;t even ask!",1407193184

8134506,comment,8133103,8133499,1,0,ajmurmann,,,"I agree completely that traffic engineering is much better in Germany and makes a huge difference. Roads are better sign posted, on ramps are very generous.\nAs I mentioned elsewhere in Germany you are also not allowed to overtake on the right on the Autobahn. So there is a huge push for slow drivers to stay on the right and cars are nicely sorted by speed. Therefore you need to relatively rarely change lanes whereas in the US people will constantly change lanes on freeways especially in busy places like LA. That not only leads to higher risks and makes driving more aggravating, but also slows everyone down. It happens quite frequently here that I will be on a 3 lane freeway and there are three slow cars next to each other. That would be unthinkable. I believe that this allows the German Autobahn to serve more cars than freeways in the US while having in average fewer lanes. I always have this metaphor in my head where I think of it similarly to a Ethernet cable that can now submit more data because the protocol allows for fewer collisions etc.",1407192597

MongoDB&#x27;s easy programming API is a consequence of its storage layout on disk -- the JSON/BSON bytes on disk.  From that principle, you naturally get an &quot;ORM&quot; type of API exposed in the programming language basically for free.  I&#x27;m saying you don&#x27;t have to do a lot of theoretical computer science type of research and pondering to get a disklayout+API that looks like that.  In fact, the early 1960s mainframes laid out data records as fully denormalized (similar to JSON/BSON) before the relational DBs became popular in the 1970s.<p>But, if your app starts expanding into complex data that&#x27;s not 100% embedded as fields within <i>one document</i>, you start needing to do &quot;relational&quot; type of joins across documents.  And those joins will manifest itself as extra programming code/logic on the client side.  You&#x27;re still paying for added complexity.  You&#x27;re just paying in a different way from the ORM+RDBMS programmers.<p>Many MongoDB projects want it to perform more like relational.  Likewise, many RDBMS want it to act more like an object hence ORMs.  The impedance mismatch looks like irreducible complexity.",1407192488

If accessing a meaningful subset of your data requires 14 joins and returns 600 attributes, your data model probably isn&#x27;t going to be friendly to many ORMs. Just write the SQL, maintain the sprocs and tvfs, and give up on trying to fit everything neatly into an object-to-table mapping.<p>But if you&#x27;re tired of rewriting the same, CRUD-like SQL over and over again, and want a common framework for accessing similarly structured data, you&#x27;ll inevitably write an ORM (however minimal) and then you&#x27;re facing the same problems that every ORM has attempted to solve to date.<p>The biggest danger in using an ORM is that it will constrain how you structure your data model. It took me a long time to become comfortable with using (materialized) views to back my models, or using multiple models for a single table. But being able to divorce my data model from my conceptual model has helped me immensely, in terms of avoiding a lot of the problems the author is talking about.

There are very, very few viewpoints that I dismiss out of hand, but opposition to renewable energy is one of them (maybe the only one). Energy is one of the world&#x27;s most important resources, and we know that we are using a source which is ultimately finite. Even if oil reserves were to last another 10,000 years (and the vast majority of experts do not think this is the case), what do we have to lose by moving our infrastructure towards a renewable source? Not doing so is cutting off the branch we are sitting on.<p>I can tolerate people who are apathetic about this issue...I understand the greed of people who enter the oil industry without regard for the environment...I can sympathize with people who say they&#x27;re concerned with personal expense (e.g. buying solar panels for their house)...but being flat-out opposed to the idea of removing humanity&#x27;s dependence upon a limited resource is just ludicrous.

Larger differences in speed between vehicles are related to a higher crash rate. Without exception, a vehicle that moved (much) faster than other traffic around it, had a higher crash rate.<p>Which is the whole point of this article.  The article isn&#x27;t saying that isn&#x27;t dangerous, it is saying that speed <i>differential</i> is more dangerous than speed.  It is saying that speed limits are generally ignored by most people (most people drive some combination of the speed of traffic and the speed they feel comfortable with), however the few people that DO listen to them cause accidents because it makes the differential speed much higher.<p>> A good starting mental model is that vehicle speeds increase both the frequency and severity of crashes.<p>This is a horrible starting model.  The severity of crashes is physics, but the frequency can&#x27;t be looked at in isolation.  Even the article you cite hints at the fact that the relationship isn&#x27;t that simple:  In figure 1, rural roads with higher speed limits have a shallow linear relationship between crashes and speed, while urban roads with lower speed limits have a much steeper, exponential relationship between crashes and speed.

Sometimes the real world intervenes and you can&#x27;t accept the ride in 15 seconds, especially if you are driving and not pulled over.<p>One more data points:<p>- I can&#x27;t speak for Uber/Lyft but if you talk to their drivers you will see that their requirements are similar if not lower.",1407190335

Our <i>minimum</i> reliability rate is 50% but a vast majority of our rides are done by what we call our exclusive drivers who have a 70% (soon 80%) reliability rate requirement with additional perks. I will update the post to clarify this!<p>There are multiple reasons why a driver might not accept a ride but they all revolve around the fact that drivers are not our employees and they often are unable to or forget to become unavailable when they should be:<p>- She just took a break to have lunch (should have turned the app to unavailable but forgot)<p>- She is a taxi driver (we have both taxi and personal drivers on the platform) and just picked up a ride on the street and got a 2nd ride before she could turn unavailable (we measure volume in rides/second at busy times)<p>- She drives for other platforms as well and accepted a ride request on it before she could turn unavailable<p>- Each driver has 15 seconds to accept a ride before it goes to another driver. Sometimes the real world intervenes and you can&#x27;t accept the ride in 15 seconds, especially if you are driving and not pulled over.<p>One more data points:<p>- I can&#x27;t speak for Uber/Lyft but if you talk to their drivers you will see that their requirements are similar if not lower.",1407190239

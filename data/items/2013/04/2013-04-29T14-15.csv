Then after that they need to get a Nobel Prize in it too.<p>Clearly, the difficult in becoming a designer and a developer at the same time is similar to that of obtaining Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry.",1367247599

Any research done by third-parties on the subject has shown that piracy generally helps the sales of the products being pirated due to:<p>A) Raising awareness of the product and giving the product exposure to a larger group of fans raising awareness of the product and studio responsible for the production.<p>B) Converting a minority of pirate-based customers with limited financial resources into paying customers for current and future projects.<p>C) Establishing in the player community's mind that the media being pirated is a worthwhile competitor to other forms of entertainment.<p>D) Finally, the most important factor: The majority of pirates pirate material because they are the highest-paying and most discerning group of purchasers of media (Source: <a href=""http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Another-Study-Pirates-Are-Industrys-Biggest-Paying-Customers-122852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Another-Study-Pirates-Are...</a>).<p>So fighting against piracy is a losing battle. DRM punishes paying customers and sure, some games might suffer as a result of piracy. It's just that if more people are pirating your game than buying it, then nine times out of ten, your product probably wasn't worth purchasing to being with, which is a cold reality that the data supports that indie studios really don't want to hear. No one wants to be told their baby sucks, especially when they see what they perceive to be a ""large number"" of people playing it.",1367247421

5626437,comment,5624727,5625800,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Please don't think I'm not taking your question seriously, but I do think the future model is a donate button (I also say above, I think it boils down to begging). I do also consider this model sustainable since, even ignoring all the other ways fame can be monetized, the potential audience is 7 billion people and a gift of even $1 from even 0.001% is $100,000 - enough to justify most indie projects. But if that's too risky, I am encouraging people to put the horse back in front of the cart and to hit up people through kickstarter... (It still amounts to begging/patronage, but it's more predictable by being up-front.) The main difference between that and the old publisher-oriented model, is that creators have all the control over the terms.<p>I would also love to see people release commercial stuff more under CC-SA and similar (even if they still charge for distribution), or the FOSS licenses - assuming they need one. There's no reason they can't generate income, even while being shown through a subscription. The license doesn't change the distribution model. (Ubuntu is asking for donations. I would love to see some stats.) I think people just need to get used to flying without a net (copyright).<p>Take Netflix for example: they are producing their own shows. Like iTunes, all the content on Netflix can be torrented, but Netflix is easier for non-technical people. I don't even think copyright is necessary for either of Netflix's or iTunes' success. Netflix is a subscription, but I think they could make a similar amount if their shows were CC-SA licensed. People pay for both Netflix and iTunes because downloading is simply harder and more likely to give their computer an STD, even if the quality can be better ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5621119"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5621119</a> ). Copyright still affects the food chain today, but Netflix has convinced me that they don't need copyright to keep the game going.<p>What's more likely however, I think, is that we will see something like the 6.4/93.6 ratio continue into the future, painfully and in spite of copyright, and with much resentment, until that hostility turns to acceptance (though, by then we'll probably have other generational gaps to deal with) - assuming we can get through the next 10-20 years without a censorship/copyright-centric police state. 6.4% of 7 billion, for something priced as low as $1, is still revenue of 448 million, even without budging that ratio, so I have no doubt creators will do well.<p>Edit: I don't feel like waiting 40 minutes for the reply button to appear on your comment, but I suppose only time will tell. In the mean time, the pro-copyright-ons and anti-copyright-ons will likely have to learn to live with each other, if for no other reason then so they don't collide and annihilate, sending us all back to the stone age (or industrial age).",1367246680

Don't hire an old person or a young person or a guy or a girl or a... just.. don't.<p>An individual at age 40 is generally more qualified than he or she was at age 25. However, absent of other context the fact that one individual is 25 and another is 40 has no bearing on the prediction of whether the one individual or the other is a better fit for a technical role. Go for the individual who can show adaptability and/or a history of compounding success in the areas that you need.<p>My anecdote:<p>I once had an argument with my former non-technical manager. She was arguing in favor of hiring a woman in her late 30s with two masters degrees to serve as a lead software architect. The degrees were in two subfields of physics, one theoretical, one applied. This would be the candidate's first position outside of academia. I participated in the candidate's entire interview process, and I recommended against hiring her for any position. She didn't have enough experience and she was awful at all of the technical portions of the interview process, especially her code. At the same time I was arguing that I should've been the lead, as this was a position the rest of the team had thrust me into and I was effective in the role. The manager's argument was that the candidate was more qualified. After some discussion, ""more qualified"" turned out to mean older (we both agreed the degrees weren't a strong indicator).<p>In the end, the candidate was hired for nearly twice my salary (apparently upper management likes letters after a candidate's name). She never fit the lead role, so the team never accepted her for it. Further, she was very ineffective as a developer (we were working in Java, her experience was in Matlab and R), so we either had to refactor a lot of her work or let it go to review and decline to accept it. Everything that went her way took months longer than necessary. In the end I think she wound up working in some type of higher-end sales/administrative capacity.",1367246633

Sometimes I might remember a photo as having a lot of ""blue"" in it, taken during a given time period.<p>But to answer your overall question, this app can definitely find an audience.

5626316,comment,5624295,5625719,6,0,mikeash,,,"For a small site, doing <i>anything</i> out of the ordinary is enough to stop the vast majority of spam.<p>For years, I had a non-captcha on my blog that simply read:<p><pre><code>    Enter the word ""elbow"": ________
</code></pre>
That was it. The word was hardcoded, and the server simply checked to see if that input field did, indeed, contain the word ""elbow"". Spam completely halted for a long time. Eventually, it started showing up again, and once I got tired of deleting a couple of spams per week, I changed it to:<p><pre><code>    Enter the word ""humour"", but with American spelling: ________
</code></pre>
Once again, spam stopped for a long time. As a bonus, I had a couple of commenters complaining that not everybody was a native English speaker and this question was too hard. I say ""bonus"", because I like keeping away commenters who can't be bothered to spend five seconds on Google.<p>This started to break down eventually as well. My latest effort, done more for fun than effectiveness, is to implement a hashcash proof-of-work system in Javascript. In short, the server sends a random salt to the client, and the client must then come up with a string which, when concatenated with the salt, has an SHA-1 hash with a certain number of leading zero bits. This is easy to verify (the server just takes the client's result, performs a hash, counts the leading zero bits) but hard to produce (the client has to brute-force it).<p>The relative slowness of JavaScript crypto makes this not actually very useful in a theoretical sense. I've calibrated the difficulty to take about 20 seconds of work in the browser, but a decent native code implementation can do the same amount of work in maybe a tenth of a second. So, against a determined attacker, it won't be much of an obstacle.<p>But as a relatively small site with a <i>completely</i> custom anti-spam solution, I don't get determined attackers. I get the occasional spam message with this in place, but from the server logs it's obvious that it's actual real human beings firing up the comment form and waiting the ~20 seconds for the hashcash to complete before posting their comment. Terribly inefficient for them, and it keeps stuff down to a manageable level.<p>In summary, if you have a small site, you can throw up nearly any custom anti-spam measure, no matter how silly or easy, and have it be effective. A standard captcha may be easier to add than a non-standard anything, but it's definitely not an ""absolute requirement"". Big sites are completely different, since they'll attract enough spammer attention for site-specific attacks.",1367245500

Even in simple ones you can build as toys, there is a lot of <i>system-internal</i> behavior: there are feedback loops, oscillations, attractors.

5626186,comment,5624727,5626029,7,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"That sounds like a complicated way of explaining the broken window fallacy. ""Maybe the economy will be better off if the glazier has the money because he will spend it better than the butcher whose window was broken."" In specific circumstances that can really be true, but in general there is no reason to expect it to be, and unless you somehow know that it is, breaking the window is more likely to cause a net loss than a net gain.<p>I think the ""economies are complicated"" explanation is the wrong one for the point you're trying to make. If you can't predict what's going to happen, and taxes <i>usually</i> (but not always) result in lower growth, you're <i>usually</i> going to lose by raising taxes. And when taxes are broad-based, this is very likely to be the case indeed. Take ""usually"" and average it over enough repeated iterations and you get something that looks a whole lot like ""always.""<p>The place you can win just by raising taxes is where you set out to tax something that it would be economically beneficial to destroy through economic disadvantage. For example, one of the problems with sustainable energy has always been that they <i>could</i> achieve cost parity with fossil fuels, but only by gaining economies of scale that they couldn't do without first achieving cost parity, so you have the chicken and egg problem. If you tax fossil fuels at a sufficient rate then that in and of itself solves the chicken and egg problem, which allows sustainable energy to increase economies of scale and become even less expensive, in the long term even less expensive than untaxed fossil fuels (especially when accounting for externalities). I assume this is what you're referring to as regime-switching. But you don't, as a general rule, get that sort of thing by imposing broad-based taxes or specifically taxing anything that you wouldn't like to discourage the consumption of, you get it by correctly predicting the outcome of a targeted tax and intentionally destroying something undesirable through taxation. (Which I don't think Sim City allowed you to do.)",1367244411

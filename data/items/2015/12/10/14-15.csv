But the fib calculation itself is done with small integer addition, things that will be about one cycle in any compiled language, and which is also what I&#x27;ve called &quot;easy mode&quot; for a JIT before. Since the calculation under test is so tiny compared to the overhead, the benchmark is <i>really</i> measuring the overhead, and due to the simplicity of the test, very vulnerable to special purpose optimizations skewing the results vs. what you might expect for real.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;useless&quot;, because that overhead can matter, but unless you have a program that is going to spend an irreducible and large amount of its time being forced to make static function calls only to do tiny amounts of work per function call relative to the function overhead, the information is only a quite tiny part of understanding the performance characteristics of a language. If one has optimized even a half-decently compiled language&#x27;s program down to where the function call overhead is your biggest problem, one is to be congratulated on some fine engineering, and I expect that you&#x27;ll know what to do next if you need more speed as you&#x27;ve already demonstrated significant competence.<p>You want to have a bit more fun, benchmark the local equivalent of &quot;dynamic&quot; dispatch. That&#x27;ll spread the languages out quite a bit more. For fun, toss in Python or something too.",1449759013

And, of course, nowhere in this article I found any discussion regarding who should - and which skills are needed to - write user stories.<p>P.S. As I said above, this is a pet peeve of mine. I&#x27;m doing a generalization; of course there are developers which are great at writing user stories and understanding users.<p>It&#x27;s just that I believe in being professional and knowledgeable.

Though I don&#x27;t fault you for thinking that; a lot of work goes in to making them feel &quot;authentic&quot; to viewers.<p>#1: PewDiePie is part of Polaris, which is the gaming sub-brand of Maker Studios, which is owned by Disney. He&#x27;s also the top grossing star on YouTube for the last few years, and you don&#x27;t stay king without a lot of marketing support.<p>#2: HolaSoyGerman is owned by Machinima. Machinima is relatively independent from big media (ignoring a $30M investment from Google), but they&#x27;re still a major player in the YouTube world.<p>#3: Smosh is a huge enterprise, a YouTube brand in itself with dozens of sub-brands. It&#x27;s the &quot;juvenile humor&quot; brand of Defy Media, which is owned by Viacom.<p>#4: This one was basically a PSA done by an actor / comedian / media personality. He likely had professional help making the video though (or is involved in video production work himself - not unusual for lesser known actors). But this one is a flash-in-the-pan viral video unless he can spin it into a production deal (though it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he had already).<p>#5: Jenna Marbles is also part of the Smosh empire, though her deal looks to give her more independence with branding than most. But still, I guarantee she&#x27;s not editing and posting videos herself.<p>All 5 of these videos were created by professional entertainers; 4 of them are the product of some YouTube media empire or another. It doesn&#x27;t seem that way looking at the videos, but that&#x27;s the entire point - it takes a lot of work to make something look low-budget yet still have high enough production value to be watchable.<p>The point remains though; you don&#x27;t get a top viewed video on YouTube without significant paid advertising to support your channel.

If your users are very good about making proper titles, using appropriate labels, etc, and most importantly, fixing up (other people&#x27;s) badly-entered issues when they come across them, you won&#x27;t have this trouble.<p>In fact, JQL is freaking awesome. It&#x27;s really like using SQL for finding tickets. For a mildly complex example, here&#x27;s the JQL I use for viewing active customer-reported bugs:<p><pre><code>    type = Bug AND (&quot;Related Support Tickets&quot; is not EMPTY OR &quot;Bug Reported by&quot; = Customer) AND (status != closed OR status changed to closed after -30d) ORDER BY updated DESC\n</code></pre>\nJIRA has a very highly-customizable workflow, which controls how tickets of various types flow from one state to another, and includes optional things like permission restrictions, required fields at certain states, etc. This can be pretty powerful and useful, and it can also be horribly crippling.<p>I wasn&#x27;t the one that introduced JIRA, but took it over fairly quickly. At this point, I don&#x27;t think we have any permission restrictions on workflow (that is: if you have access to transition issues on a project, you can do anything). The only actual restriction that springs to mind is the &quot;fixVersion&quot; field (which we use for targeting and then later confirming what release it&#x27;s in) must not be blank when closing an issue as &quot;fixed&quot;. We also early on identified any situations where people had to quickly transition between 2 or 3 workflow states (usually brought up during sprint retrospectives) to do something, and made a way to transition directly.<p>I suspect most of the pain and hate comes from badly configured or even draconian rules. If you try to make it so only QA or a manager can close a ticket, you&#x27;re going to cause friction. If you try to enforce fields get filled out even if you&#x27;re closing as &quot;wontfix&quot;, it will cause friction. If you also require 8 workflow transitions to get it from &quot;new&quot; to &quot;closed&quot; -- even for wontfix -- then yeah, people will rightfully hate it.<p>One of the best and worst things about JIRA is it&#x27;s very customizable. If your admin wants to make it a pain in the ass to get work done, JIRA will happily allow them to configure it that way.",1449758735

Cable companies have traditionally been ruled by the video business unit, but they&#x27;re starting to realize that of the $120/mo triple play, consumers only value the video service at about $30-40/mo. That&#x27;s more than it costs in licensing fees - so it would be a better profit move to charge $70-80/mo for straight Internet access. They&#x27;re increasingly willing to sacrifice low-margin (with relatively high marginal cost) video revenue for high-margin broadband revenue.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered why the cable companies haven&#x27;t partnered with Netflix to sell subscriptions.

These wines easily sells for upwards of ~$10,000 to 3 - 4 x that.<p>So radio carbon dating is only marginally useful in wine;\nyou need to use stable isotope ecology to see if the vintage matches the right terroir[1].<p>To make it even harder, most of the top vintages of French wine illegally imported grapes from neighboring regions to increase their complexity and overall flavor - this was a known but secret practice for about ~100 years, and since the French AOC[2] cracked down on it, there are concerns that modern wine lacking this complexity from blending will not age as well over ~20+ years.<p>I hope this information is helpful!<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2010/march/detecting-fake-wine-vintages-its-an-atomic-blast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/201...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terroir"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terroir</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d&#x27;origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d&#x27;origine_contr%C3...</a>",1449757262

Even if you make it work with specific versions or specific modules, it&#x27;ll always be fragile.<p>Like many modern languages that embed an event loop into themselves one way or another, the Go runtime expects to fully own the target process. It makes it difficult to play well with others, because the &quot;default&quot; C-based runtime provides so few guarantees that it&#x27;s difficult for two otherwise C-compatible runtimes to &quot;play nice&quot; with each other. It&#x27;s part of why the JVM and .Net are so interesting for cross-language development; the VM provides a richer, better-specified &quot;base layer&quot; that multiple languages can use, enabling much easier interop.<p>It&#x27;s a death-by-a-thousand-cuts sort of thing; hypothetically nothing really <i>prevents</i> this, but in reality you&#x27;re probably not going to want to take the time to make it work which may very well involve custom modifications of either runtime, when you should probably just go ahead and set up some RPC connections.

Someone has to make a decision on which solution to use for their &quot;agile&quot; development workflow, but this someone doesn&#x27;t understand that they are actually purchasing a product with a constrained, predefined version of agile. Even though it is somewhat flexible it doesn&#x27;t perfectly map onto this person&#x27;s version of agile and so, since they&#x27;ve already paid the licensing fees and gone through the office politics of getting buy in or stuffing it down the users throats, they don&#x27;t want to admit that either their version of agile could be tweaked or that they should have licensed different software. So then, the mess begins. At every turn square pegs are forced into round holes and workflows are misused with consequences that are not immediately evident. A year down the road and everyone is frustrated. You&#x27;d be better off using an excel workbook. Now you have to explain to everyone you onboard why your version of agile is so much better than other versions and warranted creating this monstrosity which they must figure out how to use without documentation  (which is useless at this point) and without frustrating their new coworkers with too many questions about the arbitrary nature of their system, which they hate and had shoved down their throats.",1449756391

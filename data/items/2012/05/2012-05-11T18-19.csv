3960742,comment,3959201,3959201,10,0,codehotter,,,"For anybody reading this and having visions of teleporting to spaceships, this is not <i>that</i> kind of teleportation.<p>Imagine two indistinguishable envelopes. Put a red piece of paper in one of them and a green piece of paper in the other. Shuffle them so you don't know which is which. Have a friend take one of the envelopes a hundred kilometers away. Then open the envelope you still have with you. It contains the green piece of paper. WHOA INSTANT TELEPORTATION OF INFORMATION! You know that the other envelope has the red paper instantly, even though it is a hundred kilometers away! Information transfer faster than the speed of light. Amazing.<p>Now, instead of using envelopes, imagine Alice generates a pair of entangled photons. Alice send one half to Bob and measures the other half. Since the photons are entangled, Alice knows what Bob must be measuring, just like with the envelopes. So what makes quantum teleportation special? What can we do with quantum teleportation that we cannot do with envelope teleportation?<p>One interesting thing about the quantum world is that we cannot measure something without disturbing it. You can use that property to make an ultra-secure cryptographic system.<p>Alice generates an entangled photon pair so that the photons are either 'pointing left' or 'pointing right' or 'pointing up' or 'pointing down'. Now, there is no way to measure directly what direction the photon is pointing in. You can choose among two tests. Test A gives you the correct answer if the photon is pointing left or right, but gives you a random result if it's pointing up or down. Test B gives you the correct result if it's pointing up or down but a random result if it's pointing right or left.<p>Doing Test A or Test B completely disturbs the photon, giving it a random state.<p>If Alice chooses a direction to measure randomly, and Bob chooses a direction to measure randomly, Bob's measurements will agree with Alice 75% of the time. Half the time, they'll choose the same method and their measures will agree, and half the time they will choose a different method and both get a random result, but through pure chance, they will still agree half the time.<p>If Eve tries to do a 'Man in the middle' attack, intercepting Alice's photons and copying the result to send to Bob, Eve will send with only 75% accuracy and Bob's measurements will be only 62.5% accurate. Thus, Eve can be detected. Watch this video for more details: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVzRbU6y7Ks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVzRbU6y7Ks</a><p>This result in the link is interesting because the researchers have been able to transport an 'entangled' photon over more than 100 kilometers, maintaining its state. It is quite hard to do since entangled photons are fragile.<p>However, the photons are not being teleported, just transmitted, and sticking to the speed limit like good space citizens. It is not that Alice can make a change to her half of the entangled pair and have that be reflected in Bob's, it's just that Alice can MEASURE her half and know what Bob must be measuring.",1336762721

3960710,comment,3960488,3960488,14,0,cjfrisz,,,"I've spent a number of months working on using CPS and trampolining to add proper tail calls to Clojure. I have a video presenting my work here: <a href=""http://www.chrisfrisz.com/blog/?p=220"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisfrisz.com/blog/?p=220</a> . You can also take a look at the code here: <a href=""https://github.com/cjfrisz/clojure-tco"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cjfrisz/clojure-tco</a> .<p>The punchline is that there are several things you can do to improve your performance: first, a number of more efficient CPS algorithms have been developed over the last 10+ years. I currently use one presented by Danvy in the 2001 paper ""A First-Order One-Pass CPS algorithm"" linked here: www.brics.dk/RS/01/49/BRICS-RS-01-49.pdf . It's major focus is to distinguish between ""serious"" and ""trivial"" expressions, because the serious ones are the only ones that actually require a new continuation to be generated. This saves a lot of administrative redexes that can kill your performance.<p>Some other CPS-related avenues you may want to look into include ""The Essence of Compiling with Continuations"" (co-authored by one of my heroes, Amr Sabry) which formalizes A-normal form, an alternative to compiling with continuations that was ground-breaking in pointing out the number of unnecessary redexes introduced by traditional CPS algorithms. There's also a more recent paper by Andrew Kennedy at MS Research called ""Compiling with Continuations, Continued"" which I admittedly have not gotten a chance to dig into yet. It's stated goal is to revive some of the ideas of the original ""Compiling with Continuations"" by Andrew Appel.<p>Of course with the method you present, continuation application isn't your only performance hit. If you're using a trampoline, you're undoubtedly thunkifying the code to delimit the bounces on the trampoline. I also need to do some work in this area, but I'm familiar with at least one paper on doing minimal thunkification from 1993 and linked here: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158.7919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158....</a> .<p>I'm a big fan of both CPS+trampolining and the work like ClojureScript that's bringing efficient Lisp programming to the JavaScript arena. I'm hoping to get a chance to look over the work that you've done with Outlet and I'd love to chat with you about it. It sounds like we share quite similar interests.",1336762353

It has probably found a few ways of violating it that are <i>not</i> possible, and done it anyway. Wayland is a part of moving back to the roots. It will lack at least 95% of all the features X has, because they really, really shouldn't be implemented as a part of a huge, monolithic system that has to run as root. Instead, all those features should be their own libraries/daemons.<p>As such, Wayland will never understand networks the way X does. Which is good, because it shouldn't. Wayland will never do anything put pass OGL handles between processes, and do the last few stages of compositing, and forward input. It actually has a well defined scope, unlike the amorphous blob that is X.<p>Nothing stops you from implementing a network transport layer <i>above</i> Wayland. And somebody will. And since there is room for competing implementations, in less than two years, there will be <i>better</i> network display protocols than what X does. When you split huge, monolithic things into smaller parts with clearly defined interfaces between them, the parts themselves become easier to make.<p><i>> Other features lacking in Wayland:</i><p><i>- A close button which works</i><p>This is trivial. Just don't draw the close button with the application. Personally, I want my ""close program"" in a static place on the screen, so that's not a problem at all. If you want close buttons above windows, make the window manager put a small box it owns in the upper corner.<p><i>- consistent decoration across apps</i><p>When is the last time you tried to run apps from different toolkits on the same desktop? Notice that they look the same <i>because it's implemented in the toolkit</i>? X doesn't have consistent decorations across apps, and hasn't had them for a decade.<p><i>- efficient cut and paste</i><p>Why, oh why should that be part of the display server? Just why? Do you just want to pile all the features in the system into one big ball? And as for efficient, just how often do you cut and paste anyway?<p>Wayland lacks feature X is not a valid criticism against Wayland. Because that does not mean that a system using Wayland lacks feature X. And the primary feature of Wayland is that it implements as few features as possible.",1336762199

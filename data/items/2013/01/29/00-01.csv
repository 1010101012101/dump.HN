If acquisition of talent through immigration is another channel, so be it.<p>The idea of education subsidies is also interesting to consider.

5131720,story,,,1,0,throwaway458,"Show HN: Pandora for Porn - Fapulike.com (NSFW)",,"http://www.fapulike.com (NSFW!)<p>Almost 2 years ago, when I was working on building collaborative filtering recommendation systems for my day job, I had some ideas that I wanted to test out on my own. I wanted to see if I could build a recommendation engine based purely on content-based filtering, but I wanted to test what would be the least amount of information needed for it to be useful. Well, it turns out, pictures in general have very little to almost no useful metadata that could help content-based systems. Except for one particular type of picture - an adult porn picture. Most of these are shared willy nilly but many sites categorize them loosely in to groups. Also with the advent of nsfw reddits, there's always some metadata that can be extracted from the subreddit these pictures are shared to.<p>Anyway, long story short, I started down the road and have made considerable progress. I launched Fapulike.com almost a year ago and it was received well (I get about 3K uniques/day and 15K pageviews/day). In order to achieve my original goal of an effective recommendation system, my aim is to increase the  pages/visit count from 3 to 15. Currently, it's at 5-6 pages/visit but I hope my latest redesign bumps that considerably.<p>I know a lot of people don't like to talk about porn projects openly, but I wanted to share my story of how I introduced some science in to the online porn sphere.

You could as well say that skin color is correlated with intelligence because (I'm just making this up) living in Africa was easier than in harsher climates so their brains got smarter.<p>Btw, it's easy to see if your hypothesis is correct. Just check the heights of graduate males of tough university programs such as medical research, physics, mathematics etc. I belive that the distribution of their heights will be closer to the population average than the heights of CEO:s, top politicians and other ""high-status"" jobs. I belive it is because those positions isn't selected to solely on merit, but also on charisma or vaguely defined ""leadership qualities.""<p>In my experience, with lots of developers and engineers I've worked with, there is no height bias among them. Tall and short engineers and everyone in between. However, upper management and the sales guys are generally tall guys. Now, assuming that height is positively correlated with intelligence, and assuming that engineers are smarter than management and sales people, that observation makes no sense. :) You would expect to see extra tall engineers (because they need the extra brainpower) and shorter management and sales people.",1359418775

The closest analogy I can think of is that it's like requiring users to change passwords every 30 days: great in theory, but in practice it's a disaster.<p>The problem is that it is simply untenable for all but the highest-profile sites. Finding good ops people, even in the bay area, is extremely hard. Most sites are only going to realize that a security update has been released when their package manager tells them it has, and updating that package is usually a 30s process.<p>The companies I've seen have a hard enough time keeping track of security updates <i>with</i> package management. For a small to medium team with two, one, or even <i>zero</i> dedicated ops people, asking them to custom-compile (for example) a webserver, ruby implementation, and other critical libraries (openssl, glibc, etc.), subscribe to the relevant security mailing lists, and follow along with updates and security patches is tantamount to having them leave unpatched vulnerabilities on their systems for months or even years.<p>If you ask your users to change passwords every 30 days, there are inevitably going to be a few who take it seriously and generate and remember secure passwords every single time. But the vast majority are going to use <i>weaker</i> passwords than they otherwise would have, and duplicate those passwords across accounts as much as they can figure out how. Likewise, if you ask already overworked ops guys to manually compile and keep track of security vulnerabilities for their webserver and dozens of libraries, a few are inevitably going to keep on top of things and release fixes minutes after vulnerabilities are announced. But the vast majority are going to simply give up after a month or two and be significantly worse off than if they just use Ubuntu's automatic security package updates.",1359418624

( Within legal limits, but the thought that Mercedes would preclude you from driving north of 38 N is simply ridiculous.) You may even paint it in a new color or install a new engine. By contrast if you license software it is not clear what you are allowed to do with it. Are you allowed to use it in a nuclear power plant? ( Java is excluding itself from such an environment.) Or are you allowed to modify the software, after commercial support did run out. So free software is first of all software which is licensed to you in a closer analogy to the rights you get by buying a car.<p>With this in mind, there is a interesting side effect of free software, namely that you are allowed to sell it just as you are allowed to sell your car. But unlike cars you also have the means of production for software, which means that all it takes for free software to be free as in beer is one guy who is willing to give copies of his copy away for free. ( This is of course exactly the same as with commercial software, the difference is, that free software realizes that abundance is a feature.)<p>So if you are willing to pay for software and you find that free software suits your needs, perhaps after trying the software, then you should consider a donation for the developers of that software or for the FSF.",1359418437

Then we regulate the semi sane stuff - like how much space a cow need and what is humane - well that makes some sense. It may not be the urgent problems, but animal cruelty is bad.<p>And then when they run out, just to keep the staff employed and budgets growing they try to regulate unregulatable stuff.<p>Just put that unfiltered, unmonitored and encrypted internet is a human right. And then hear the scream of the bureaucracy.",1359417655

It's also probably not an argument that will elicit much sympathy from American workers.",1359417643

Except in basketball, when you see a group of athletes, you'll tend to see a range of heights.  A little taller than average?  Sure.  But not immensely so.<p>And then, athleticism is doubtless correlated with admission to elite universities, but, again, only weakly so.  The top tier and second tier universities like to see some extracurricular activities on your record, but ""being good at cross country running"" is far from a sure-fire way to get into Harvard.  The REALLY good athletes don't go to top-tier academic universities, and don't get corporate jobs -- they're on the pro athlete track.<p>You might get into Harvard due to being a good football player but not good enough to go pro, even if you were not otherwise academically capable of going to Harvard.  But, first, you're now talking about a small percentage of Harvard students.  Second, I'd like to see some data before I'd concede that IF you're clearly not elite-university quality academically, BUT you get in on your athletic merits, AND you go into a corporate track job, THEN you end up with an elite career path.<p>So, long story short:  Is there probably some advantage to height through the path you suggest?  Yes, probably some measurable advantage.  Is it enough to explain the pretty substantial advantage that tall men enjoy according to the literature?  I can't see how.  It's passing through too many weak correlations.",1359417625

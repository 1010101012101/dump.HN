E.g. when Apple already makes an iPod and an iPhone then it&#x27;s smart diversification to make an iPad. That gets you growth without needing to resort to share buybacks.<p>Apple&#x27;s smart growth is much better than the flailing growth that many companies attempt. E.g. Google has search so Microsoft does Bing. Apple has the iPod so Microsoft does the Zune.<p>New products are OK if they are clearly better than what is already out there, but in Microsoft&#x27;s case they weren&#x27;t. Contrast with the iPhone. It was IMO clearly better than what was already out there, if for no other reason than Apple refused to be the wireless carriers&#x27; bitch.<p>But now even Apple is doing share buybacks, because they&#x27;re running out of smart diversification ideas. An iWatch wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to provide meaningful growth. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll eventually do it, but the law of large numbers is no longer on Apple&#x27;s side.<p>The example I gave of me wanting Intel to become a world class foundry is IMO smart diversification.

I literally saw this happen when I was at the Salk institute as a lowly undergraduate research assistant. Sir Francis Crick was there at the same time, and spent his last 25 or so years in pursuit of a theory of consciousness. I was fortunate (and humbled) to get to talk to him a few times before he passed in 2004, and he was undoubtedly a thinker of superior ability and unbounded curiosity (a pretty awesome combination).<p>Actually there were (and still are) a lot of the biggest names in the field there at the time (including Crick, Terrance Sejnowski (a professor of mine who co-invented the Boltzmann machine* amongst other things), VS Ramachandran). These are all people who were coming at the problem from the biological &| pure science/math side of things (vs people like Andrew Ng, who Sam mentioned, who have a more CS/engineering based approach).<p>No doubt they consistently came up with spectacular theories and very interesting models of how a specific regions of the brain may function. How for the most part they worked was this:<p>1. Come up with a biologically or cognitively plausible mathematical model (many of which were fantastically cool). \n2. Implement and run this model on massively parallel architectures (at the time not quite the level of technological sophistication you see nowadays, so things may have changed a lot)\n3. To train, use feedback from EEG (this is what I &quot;worked&quot; on, but they also worked with other electrical signals, MRI and chemical measurements at the level of individual neurons).<p>The biggest progress was made at the smallest level (understanding how individual neurons and small networks work). This was primarily because measurement at this level actually provided useful information. The signal/noise ratio of EEG scalp recordings (which to this day gives me nightmares) was (and is) so terrible that I left the field as a quite disgruntled phd student. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t have the intellectual capacity, but I never felt like I was working on anything that made sense. This was true for <i>many</i> of my fellow graduate students .. after a couple years, we felt we were doing pseudoscience.<p>Rant completed, I think the CS/engineering approach is more promising: don&#x27;t worry about the biology or some grand theory of the mind and just try to do something useful. Since computers get more powerful consistently, we&#x27;ll incrementally be able to do more and more useful things. If consciousness emerges at all, it may or may not appear like <i>human</i> consciousness. We may not even be able to tell if/when this happens, but at least we would be solving real problems in the meanwhile.<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine</a>",1393980567

Same is true for cooking, an Indian joint family could be very big (20/25 members). And cooking for the whole family in open fire is not an easy feat either. So most of household work in a big joint family could be extremely strenuous.

The apparently harmful effects of a high-protein diet might be down to one or more other substances in meat, or driven by lifestyle factors that are more common in regular red meat eaters versus vegetarians. Other factors can skew results too: a person on the study who got ill might have gone off their food, and seen a proportional rise in the amount of calories they get from protein. In that case, it would be the illness driving the diet, not the other way round.\n</code></pre>\nA lot of people in the US who eat an animal protein rich diet get their protein from red meat instead of say white meat or seafood. There are huge differences between red meat and white meat, and even bigger differences between red/white meat and seafood.<p>And a lot Americans who consume red meat prepare it in a way that are known to form heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to cause cancer in animals.<p>Maybe the type of animal protein doesn&#x27;t matter but if you don&#x27;t look specifically at these issues you&#x27;re apt to reach conclusions that are way too broad (ie animal proteins are bad). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sensible to sound the alarm about animal protein before you have a study that factors for which animal proteins are being consumed.<p>One interesting thing to ponder in light of this study is the Okinawa region of Japan. It has a very high age expectancy (one of the highest in the world) and I believe a much higher than average protein intake, a lot of which comes from seafood. So I think it&#x27;s folly to just look at protein intake without looking at the source of the protein and the overall composition of the diet.

7344318,comment,7341750,7343533,2,0,arg01,,,"Depends on your visa. I ANAL etc, just spent a bit of time a while ago looking at the visa situation. Basically you will probably get away with a B-1 visa for your three month run very simply (electronic registration online and ~$15). It&#x27;s a bit questionable as the work your doing could technically get you in hot water though deal signing and seminars are fine.<p>After those three months you will have to leave, you can come back on the same type of visa (though it is more likely you are breaching it) but you&#x27;ll likely be asked more serious questions and if a border agent doesn&#x27;t like you then you could be out of luck and barred from re-entry.<p>One of the key things to remember is the penalties for getting caught breaking any visa conditions could essentially get you barred from reentry for life.<p>So after that first three months you&#x27;ll probably want a visa that line up with the fact that you&#x27;re now effectively working in the US.<p>H-1B, which will require your startup to be up and running and look reputable and they are in short supply.<p>O, which will require you to show your a respected top of your field type person (i.e. articles written about you, speaking engagements).<p>E-1, your company must be non-us (which isn&#x27;t ideal for YC) and a substantial volume (and over 50% of the international trade) of trade must occur in the US.<p>E-2, 50%+ of the business must be owned by investors in your country (you and your co-founders). Possibly your best bet but you&#x27;ll need a substantial amount of your wealth (cash,IP (which might effect how you work for your company to set up IP transfer which might not be agreeable with other investors)) committed to the business (100K+) in a non-revocable fashion. Also if the business fails your visa is no longer valid. Risky but probably the most achievable in terms of startups (with regards to getting back in the country doing it quickly and with a high degree of certainty).<p>L-1 this will require you to have an office in your own country as well, you&#x27;ll effectively transfer yourself between the two offices. Keep in mind that immigration aren&#x27;t robots and you&#x27;ll need to show your not just playing a shell game.<p>If your canadian(mexican too I believe) TN, basically with an offer of employment from a US company you can work there for 3 years. They&#x27;ll need supporting details and you&#x27;d do well to have the company at a point were you can technically get fired to be credible (i.e. board of directors/you don&#x27;t own 51% of the company).<p>Edit: Also visas have intent. i.e. Plan to immigrate or not. If you have a visa with no intent to immigrate and you look like you&#x27;re planning to immigrate then you can be found to have broken your visa conditions and barred reentry/kicked out. So if you grab a work visa that does not have intent to stay then apply for a visa that only has intent to stay your current visa can be invalidated, you may have to wait until your current visa expire before applying for a more appropriate one.<p>The go to advice is find an imigration lawyer, they&#x27;ll have a better idea than you or me on how to set this up.<p>There are also more options that may open up as your business grows but if you&#x27;re at the point of considering them you are at the point were you&#x27;ll have the resources and responsibility to get lawyers  to do the majority of the leg work finding/explaining your options.<p>There may be better news on the horizon:<p><a href=""http://startupvisa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupvisa.com/</a>",1393979114

An RDF daemon or kio-audiocd (i don&#x27;t have a CD drive)?  I use awesome as a window manager, so I do not have KDE/GNOME installed. However i can and sometimes will install most &quot;gnome&quot; apps because they do not have a dependency on gnome-core.

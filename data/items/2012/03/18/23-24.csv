Even if it's true that stock buy backs are frequently undertaken by companies which doubt their future growth potential (I have no idea if this is true), I don't think there's any danger of a buyback from Apple sending this signal.  They're in a historically unique position, and whatever their decision, it's not going to be analyzed solely based on the status of other companies who have undertaken similar actions.",1332115183

C has heavily bottlenecked program control logic from the beginning - a callstack, looping constructs, etc. - and allowing some equivalents to exist in its data structures would make user code tremendously more reliable.<p>These changes, often paired with some more attention to concurrency, show up in all the newer system language designs - D, Go, Rust, Clay, BitC, etc.",1332114498

But I'd actually invert that relationship. A good speaker is someone who understands his audience, so that he can maximize both his connection to it and his impact upon it.<p>The intent of speaking, and the intent of writing, aren't altogether different. In either case, a typical goal is to convey information to an audience, and to maximize the audience's uptake of that information. Uptake naturally follows from conveyance, and successful conveyence depends upon successful connection (or ""breakthrough""). So, it stands to reason, knowing one's audience is a necessary precondition to engaging one's audience. Some audiences are tougher to engage than others. And what necessarily breaks through for Audience A may fly right over the heads of Audience B, or piss off Audience C, or strike Audience D as a joke.<p>This distinction is important to make, because too many people write or speak primarily for themselves. They assume a hypothetical audience of likeminded people, and they blame the audience when their words don't hit their marks. This mindset is so prevalent that the exclamation ""Tough crowd!"" has become something of a cliche. It's true that some crowds are ""tougher"" than others, but the failure to engage a particular crowd usually lies mainly with the speaker or writer. (Even when it doesn't, it's best to assume it does; assumption of failure provides a useful lesson, whereas blame deferral offers no room for growth).",1332113429

3721418,comment,3721142,3721305,7,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Most database engines of moderate sophistication straddle the ""systems"" and ""application"" line because they start directly managing system resources at a low level. Application servers are a bit more like ""applications"".<p>Database engines highlight some of the reasons that Java is a poor systems language relative to C/C++. High-performance database engines these days are usually bottlenecked by memory I/O performance and efficiency, or storage I/O if you under-provision the machine resources for the workload. This is why you see I/O optimizations applied to in-memory databases, for example. Java may be fast at many things, but it is much slower than C/C++ for codes that are bound by memory performance and efficiency. You have to start doing very awkward things in Java to even come close to what comes naturally in languages that explicitly manage memory behavior and structure. As someone who has written a lot of database engine-y code in both C++ and Java, the difference in absolute performance for nominally equivalent code is not small, and is generally easier to achieve in C++. So for low-level performance-oriented systems, there is a pretty strong bias toward C++, particularly now that there is a lot of experience trying to implement the same systems in Java.<p>For performance sensitive codes, systems programming is really about carefully managing resources to optimize for characteristics of the system. C makes this very easy because it exposes all of it. To the extent that CPU architectures are increasingly bound by memory performance, I would not be surprised to see C++ supplanting Java for certain purposes.<p>This makes sense. Java was designed more as an application language that works well for codes that are unlikely to make heavy use of the memory system. Its popularity and generality has caused it to be widely used but that does not always make it a good choice outside of its original design case (see also: Perl).",1332113332

But physical size isn't the right design target either.  An icon designed for a given physical size on a display close to the user's eyes won't work if the display is much further away.<p>So when you go from thinking about pixel size to thinking about physical size, you're going in the right direction, but you're not going far enough.  The relevant metric is more like ""the angle subtended at the user's eyes"", kinda like how the ""CSS pixel"" unit works.<p>Now, given that it's almost impossible for software on the device to know how far away the user is, trying to design up front for that metric (angle subtended by the icon) is also almost impossible.<p>And even if you did know both the pixel density and the distance to the display, that still doesn't take into account the fact that users will vary in their visual acuity.  The right design choice for a 20-year-old user holding the display close to their face is going to be dramatically different from the right choice for a 70-year-old holding the display at arms length.<p>You can't really design well for all those possibilities up front.  The right answer has to involve allowing the user to adjust the ""zoom level"" to their liking.  And that level of flexibility means that automated approaches (possibly something like freetype's autohinting, extended to work in color) are probably going to be a better approach than manual pixel tweaking.",1332113264

The mark of a great speaker is one who conveys complex ideas with (apparent) ease, not simply one who engages and entertains the audience. While those qualities are certainly helpful, unless the audience comes away with some level of understanding, in my opinion, the speaker has failed.<p>A great speaker distills ideas and arguments down to their core essence so they can be easily absorbed. While, in the speaker, this may not be a source for ideas, it should be a catalyst of ideas for the listener. In this, the speaking is superior to that of the written word. This is especially true if you are in a room full of people who approach you after when it could quickly turn out to be a source of ideas for the speaker as well.<p>Further, all the issues pg seems to have with speaking could just as easily be applied to writing. I have read more nonsensical fluff wrapped up in a entertaining package than I care to admit.

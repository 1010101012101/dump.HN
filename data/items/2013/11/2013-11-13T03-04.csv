6723252,comment,6719487,6722926,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"I think you have to factor in the threat of a credit ding. If the debtor knew that reductions would result in a lower credit score (and perhaps the degree of the credit penalty would be a function of the debt reduction percentage), then you can bring some parity back into the scenario.<p>I am also not sure how debt is currently priced. But, it would seem that current credit score and other metrics might go into the pricing, such that there is more of an actuarial approach. In this case, the price wouldn&#x27;t be driven as much by information assymetry.<p>So, combine a lender who is more informed about how much debtors can pay with debtors who have incentive to pay as much as possible to protect their credit, then add the fact that you&#x27;re throwing out the middlemen (debt collectors). It might be a win-win for the creditor/debtor, with only the debt buyers losing.",1384315020

Both Go and Angular have been 1.0+ for quite some time, so it&#x27;s not really a fair comparison.<p>While I&#x27;m impressed with Go, I personally find Dart far more accessible. Because of my Java background it makes a lot more intuitive sense, and its target user-group is web developers. Go has an immense amount of power for the same group, but unfortunately it&#x27;s marketed as a system-level language (which I understand it does very well, but isn&#x27;t of interest to me) and is similarly inaccessible. If Go focused more on presenting itself (particularly in the tutorials/learning aids area) as a language for web development, I think it&#x27;d stand an excellent chance of stealing market (and mind) share from Node, and possibly even Dart on the server-side.<p>It&#x27;s possible they will pursue this course in the future as it has become quite obvious that their intended user-group (C++/low-level guys) aren&#x27;t generally that interested in a replacement language.<p>Like many others who&#x27;ve kept Dart on their radar, I&#x27;ve been waiting to get serious about Dart until it stabilized at 1.0. Now that its 1.0 release is imminent, I&#x27;m likely to move into Dart in a big way. JS is fine and works very well for a lot of folks, but Dart is much more appealing (a lot more sane) to me.<p>I suspect when it&#x27;s been post-1.0 as long as Go and Angular it&#x27;ll be as popular. In other words, give it a year or two.",1384314860

It has one paragraph with the licensing costs, which is useful information, and then the two sentence blurb on David Lowery, which didn&#x27;t seem to be meaningfully connected to the issue at all (it actually is somewhat negative in my view, because it seems to imply a slight hint of perhaps ad hominem, but that was just my initial impression, and doesn&#x27;t seem totally justified upon rereading).

6723231,comment,6719260,6722567,2,0,haberman,,,"> pepper.js shows that Pepper is effectively equivalent to the functionality the Web APIs provide<p>From my reading of it, pepper.js can only support a subset of Pepper&#x27;s complete capabilities.  At a high level, it is missing:<p><pre><code>    - threads
    - memory mapping
    - memory protection
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s also stuff like this in pepper.js that clearly demonstrates a lack of parity:<p><pre><code>    // The Web Audio API currently does not allow user-specified sample rates.
    var supportedSampleRate = function() {
      return createAudioContext().sampleRate;
    }
</code></pre>
Also pepper.js is filled with chunks of code like:<p><pre><code>    var FileRef_GetFileSystemType = function() {
      throw &quot;FileRef_GetFileSystemType not implemented&quot;;
    };

    var FileRef_GetName = function() {
      throw &quot;FileRef_GetName not implemented&quot;;
    };

    var FileRef_GetPath = function() {

    var FileRef_GetParent = function() {

    var FileRef_MakeDirectory = function() {

This implementation keeps uncertainty small (generally less than 10ms) by using multiple modern clock references (GPS and atomic clocks).&quot;<p>[1] Spanner: Google&#x27;s globally-distributed database

I also find that mfg skins are equally bad.  That said, clear warnings, even multiple warnings are important.<p>When I rooted my G1, IIRC, there were several downloads I needed.. downgrade X, upgrade Y, root, upgrade X, install C, then B, then R... then apply GAPPS, etc.   It was very unnerving, and that was important for me to triple check everything.

They generally aim for roughly a certain mix of proteins, carbs and fats + various mixes of other ingredients that often seem to be chosen mostly to be buzzword complete.<p>In fact, here&#x27;s some sales copy regarding Myoplex:<p>&quot;EAS recommends supplementing your diet with 2-3 high quality Myoplex nutrition shakes along with 3-4 whole food meals a day to ensure that any nutritional &quot;gaps&quot; are filled. &quot;<p>I use a lot of supplements - for my protein intake I use or have used a variety of shakes, bars, muffins (yes...), cookies, to complement my high protein &quot;real foods&quot;. To date I have never found a sports supplement that tastes nice without being way too high calorie for my use, but I can tolerate that for the convenience.<p>But more importantly: most sport supplements are very limited in their overall nutritional profile. For a reason - for protein heavy products people tend to focus on whey and to a lesser extent casein, and most products aim to minimize other ingredients unless that are products for specific other purposes, such as weight gainers etc. They&#x27;re <i>supplements</i> for occasional meal replacement. They are not intended to replace food in general.<p>And exactly what appeals to me about Soylent is that it might provide a good alternative to fill those &quot;nutritional gaps&quot; mentioned in the Myoplex sales copy, which are pretty much inevitable if you were to stick with only regular sports supplements. As I said: I&#x27;m not interested in replacing food entirely, but having something available that I can have reasonable confidence is reasonably complete, that I know the calorie content of by volume, so it&#x27;s easy to measure and keep track, and that is quick and convenient for when I don&#x27;t have the time or want the hassle of sorting out a proper meal would be great.",1384313443

The actual answer is more complex.<p>Camera:<p>The high data rate required for imaging module means that it doesn&#x27;t run on a shared bus. There&#x27;s a number of standards, some proprietary and others loosely defined, but they all use direct connections to the image processor (which is in many cases part of the SoC).<p>Microphone:<p>Probably not going to access this one, because microphone wouldn&#x27;t be on any sort of bus. They&#x27;ll have a direct connection to a ADC, which would have a direct connection to an audio signal processor in the SoC.<p>Other sensors:<p>This depends on the implementation. If they use I2C, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll be on a shared bus on which the baseband processor is also located. However, accessing that data requires details about the specific sensor. If a particular model of phone is being targeted, this isn&#x27;t too hard. For example, I know the iPhone 4 uses the LIS331DLH Accelerometer. I can find the datasheet for that part, and then write a simple driver to access it&#x27;s data.
If they use SPI, which isn&#x27;t a bus-based protocol, there&#x27;s little chance of accessing the information directly. SPI devices can be daisy chained or separately selected to put more than one on a single port, but in such a configuration there&#x27;s only ever one master (which would be the CPU).",1384313437

Intent may help to determine the morality of a thing, but the absense of intent does not necessitate that something is morally appropriate. That is, of course they are <i>completely separable</i>.<p>><i>Also, your Gitmo example demonstrates much the opposite point.</i><p>It really doesn&#x27;t. See previous comment regarding intent. Also, you completely miss the point and you seem to be confusing yourself. Your previous assertion was that the NSA&#x27;s not setting out to violate detainee rights as an end goal absolves them (or matters at all) to some extent. If you agree that &quot;prisons are [or even could be] used for an evil purpose at Gitmo&quot;, as you say, then you have conceded my point. That is, whether they intended for Gitmo to violate detainee civil rights as the end goal, the evil that now exists is unacceptable and there are people who are responsible for it. No one is talking about the rightness of prison as a concept or whether serial killers should be incarcerated. That&#x27;s just strange.<p>In general, you seem to just throw out a bunch of pedantic or semantic arguments as red herrings and strawmen.

6723118,comment,6722693,6722693,9,0,dljsjr,,,"This is such a fascinating topic because the field of robotics  outside of industrial applications is still so nascent.  I&#x27;m not here to weigh in, just to drop off some useful tidbits for other people interested in this ethical gray area as well.<p>This theme of &quot;terminators&quot; and &quot;killer robots&quot; has been really prevalent in the field lately because of the DARPA Robotics Challenge[1], the latest in DARPA&#x27;s Grand Challenges, which I&#x27;m currently participating in on one of the Track B teams.  Many people see the break away from bomb-squad bots and factory floor robotic arms in to humanoids as a really scary thing, and the DRC seems to amplify that (if a robot can hold a sawzall, it can hold a rifle).<p>Just last month in Atlanta, the IEEE Humanoids conference took place. Dr. Ronald C. Arkin[2] gave a talk exactly on this topic from an ethics perspective, titled &quot;How to NOT build a Terminator&quot;, and it was exceptional.  It was a plenary talk and not a paper, so I can&#x27;t really find any record of it to share.  Unfortunate.<p>Tangentially, the lab that I work in (the robotics group at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition[3][4]) has employed and continues to employ a principle that we call &quot;co-active design&quot;[5] where we actively work to keep a human in the loop at all times; we&#x27;re definitely not looking to build a &quot;killer robot&quot;.  It&#x27;s an interesting design problem that overlaps a lot with UI and UX, popular topics here on HN.<p>And lastly, a shameless plug for the field itself; a lot of people don&#x27;t realize just how software-oriented robotics research (especially humanoids, where the fun problems are) is.  A lot of people are stuck on it being a hardware endeavor.  While it&#x27;s true that a chunk of robotics falls in the mechanical engineering domain, there&#x27;s plenty of room for hackers from tons of different disciplines to get involved.  There&#x27;s interesting people solving interesting problems, from the Open Source Robotics Foundation (the Willow Garage spin-off) to private groups like Boston Dynamics, yet so many people still see the field as a black-box that only opens up for the hardware inclined.  I could see a talented group with the right hacker mindset doing some really interesting stuff in robotics with the right impetus and execution.<p>1:<a href=""http://theroboticschallenge.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theroboticschallenge.org</a><p>2:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_C._Arkin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_C._Arkin</a><p>3:<a href=""http://ihmc.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ihmc.us</a><p>4:<a href=""http://robots.ihmc.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robots.ihmc.us</a><p>5:<a href=""http://www.jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/20101008_CoactiveDesign.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/20101008_Coacti...</a>",1384312511

These wars were strategic failures, in spite of the US&#x27; best efforts, simply because you can&#x27;t defeat guerillas the same way you defeat regular armies.<p>These wars were self-sacrificial because they had no valuable objective for the American people (i.e., to secure their safety). Trying to &quot;democratize&quot; them is a futile act, and is not worth spending trillions of dollars on, and killing thousands of American soldiers.<p>> Your argument was that in order to defend &quot;freedom&quot; (because, really, these money-laundering rules are just too repressive), the US should attack the issue at the root. Guess what? Most of the money being laundered is drug money. It&#x27;s an absolutely astounding amount of cash. Most of the world&#x27;s cocaine comes from Colombia and Bolivia, while the opiates come from Afghanistan.<p>Right, and the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is also self-sacrificial, because, again, it has no value for the American people. Again, it is a war that can&#x27;t be won, that simply calls for sacrificing unlimited amounts of money and some lives, and turns northern Mexico into a war zone as part of a perverse side-effect.<p>So I&#x27;m saying: Let these countries produce as much coke and opium as they want; we will be happy to import them freely.",1384312099

But I also feel that cynicism, while justifiable and oftentimes necessary, can itself be a blinder to the degree to which the faults of government can tend to take root in any power structure of any significance. Government can fall prey to abuse, and often does, but this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that a lack of government in and of itself will limit abuse where any one group of people has any power over another. If government <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a legitimate purveyor of lethal force or significant social planning then who or what is?",1384311948

5006025,comment,5005690,5005958,9,0,_dps,,,"> The Greek crisis, more than anything, is the result of massive tax evasion.<p>[Greek/US dual citizen here]<p>Having lived in Greece for upwards of a decade, during the particularly transitional time from ~1988-2004, this is not in line with my experience. Hear me out before writing me off as an apologist :)<p>Greece has a large problem with collecting the taxes they claim citizens owe but not a large problem with <i>collecting a large fraction of GDP</i>. According to the World Bank, they are right in line with Sweden and France (<a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS</a>). These numbers are corroborated by the OECD (PDF warning <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/41498733.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/41498733.pdf</a>). [Edit: I wrote Sweden and France when I meant to write Spain and France; I apologize for the error but I have left it lest someone think I am trying to whitewash :-)]<p>Greece has collected plenty of money; we overspent, and we spent stupidly i.e. in ways that obtained either votes or kickbacks, and not in ways that improved the economy or the life of the common person. As just one example, look at the paltry investment of the Greek government in its only competitive advantage, the tourism business. The cast and crew of ""Mamma Mia"" did a better job promoting tourism in Greece than any Ministry of Tourism effort. Spain, Italy, and Turkey are eating our lunch.<p>We also got used to almost five decades of ""free"" foreign money through the Marshall plan, post-communist hysteria leading to US military aid and military bases, EEC/EU growth funds, and having our debt priced as if it were of German quality.<p>In my opinion, the tax evasion is a serious <i>social justice</i> problem, but it is not a serious budgetary problem. The bulk of Greece's public budget is supplied by ordinary people making ordinary incomes, and it is a travesty that the wealthiest manage to dodge contributing proportionately. But that does not mean the government does not have enough money to do a good job.<p>I would love to believe that the government has failed due to being starved of resources; at least then a solution like taking on more debt would be plausible. With the situation as it stands, I can only respond with our poet laureate Seferis' exasperated lament, ""Everywhere I go, Greece wounds me"".",1357268056

They won't do that because of the problems on their financial sheets - they know they hold toxic assets and they know everyone else does, so they cannot trust anyone to pay off their debt, including other banks. This means that private investment has decreased severely, which puts enormous downward pressure on the economy.<p>Since the private sector won't invest, the only source of investment big enough to fill the hole (which might be as big as $8 trillion), is government. Austerity is a problem because it limits the governments ability to invest, which means that you have a shrinking economy trying to make up ground, which is a losing battle, especially for the poor as you point out, since they do not have the assets to absorb the economic hit.<p>I should say none of this is my opinion, I'm merely summarizing Krugman, Stiglitz, and Baker, who are the three economists whose work I've followed on the matter.",1357267753

I think eating is a bad example because people eat for pleasure, whereas people only write for utility. People rarely if ever write simply because they enjoy writing. They write to convey or record information, If you remove the utilitarian obligation from writing, and make it solely an exercise in enjoyment, you have to disassociate the obligatory aspect of writing, as well as the functional result. I don't know about you, but I don't really see people transcribing the alphabet 1000 in a notebook for pleasure (or other such trivial applications of writing). When people write, they do it because they have to achieve some end. This is different from fine dining, where there is no end. You don't eat because you need nutrion, but because the meal brings pleasure.<p>My second assertion was not dismissing the pleasure found in using an expensive pen and feeling good, but merely an explanation of why I think it's silly.

He isn't being hired as an engineer; he's going to be Director of Engineering.  If any of his ideas or proposals are fanciful, there are plenty of people, including Peter Norvig, to set him straight.<p>What is noteworthy about this hiring is that for the first time, a company with serious technical ability and resources is going to be tackling strong AI.  No, there was nothing in the announcement that directly mentions strong AI but I contend that they will have to tackle at least certain aspects of strong AI in order to make significant progress in speech recognition.  You can only get so far using the standard tricks that are used with traditional natural language understanding (NLU).  At some point, the system is going to have to have an abstract model of the way the world works in order to mimic the assumptions that human intelligence requires in order to understand language.<p>This shouldn't be all that surprising given what they are trying to do with Google Now.  Google Now is different from other products using speech recognition because it is <i>active</i>; it behaves more like an independent AI agent.  Think about what Google will have to do to improve its performance; it will need to build a model the user's behavior in order to tune the probability distributions that underlie the best interpretations for what someone is searching for.  You see, language understanding in humans sits upon a sizable foundation of innate assumptions about the way the world, including other humans, works.  My claim is that Google have to duplicate much of this in order to get better technical performance from Google Now as well as search.  It will need to have a prior knowledge about people in general and modify that knowledge over time by what it learns about a particular user.  What I have just described is the missing component in efforts to develop strong AI -- the mechanism by which a distributed AI can learn to mimic aspects of human thinking via evolution.  (I'm a functionalist, as you've probably gleaned already, so I would argue that the only way to improve NLU is to ground the processing in ""real"" understanding on some level.)<p>Now, Canonical could build a Google Now type system for their Ubuntu phones and seed the learning algorithms with an open source, wiki-AI type project -- you don't need Google to create such a system.  But Google has the monetary incentive, resources, and now the technical vision (Kurzweil) to justify pursuing this on a large scale, just as they did with their search engine.<p>What was the primary thing that Apple did to reach their current level of success?  They tried things that other people poo-pooed.  It wasn't that the iPhone and the iPad were technically that amazing -- that's why people are unimpressed with the quality of the patents Apple has asserted -- it's that they were the first to seriously try a lot of the features that are now standard.  As is often said around here, 90% of success is showing up.  The company I work for directly competes with Google in areas related to Google Now and I tell you I got a little nervous when I heard they had hired Kurzweil.  Again, not because of his technical abilities but because now we have to worry that Google is going to come up with something totally crazy out of left field.  The fact that Kurzweil is crazy is <i>precisely</i> why I worry.",1357267353

Long story short: for a brief period of time, the waiting period for courtrooms shot up to 2-3 years for criminal cases and <i>10 years</i> for civil cases.  Nothing can happen in court, so everything hits the fan, and the prosecution side of the criminal system breaks down.

In the US, per capita GDP between states varies by about a factor of 2 (from mid 30k to mid 60k). In the eurozone the difference is closer to a factor of 3.5 (from mid 10k to around 50k). However, even that statistic is a bit misleading due to population because a lot of the lowest per capita GDP US states also have fairly smallish populations compared to Eurozone countries. If you add up the populations of all the US states with per capita GDP's less than 40k you get a total population of about 42 million. If you do the same for the Eurozone the total population is about 140 million, or nearly half the population of the entire Eurozone. Similarly, over 30 million people are living in countries with per capita GDP less than 30k, whereas even the poorest US state is higher than that.<p>Also, the wealthiest Eurozone countries are not as wealthy as the wealthiest US states, by a fairly significant margin. On the whole the Eurozone ends up being on average about as wealthy, in per capita GDP, as arkansas.

For pens I've finally settled into the Pilot Hi Tec C 0.25 or 0.3mm in blue or black.   I have two all-metal bodies for the cartridge I got from Kickstarter, the Render K by KarasKustoms and the P1 by PremierePen.   I find that having a nice pen encourages me to write down my thoughts more often and makes my notes much more organized.   For paper I'm less picky but I like Muji products for random notes.<p>TL;DR get a nice pen, it's the best.",1357266011

But that pleasure doesn't encourage people to eat more, and a lack of pleasure doesn't compel you not to eat. The pursuit of pleasure exists independent of necessity.<p>Even if you couldn't afford lavish meals, you would still eat what you could afford, because eating is a necessity. You wouldn't starve yourself just because you couldn't eat at at 4 Star Michelin restaurants every night. Conversely, you wouldn't gorge yourself just because you were at a 4 star restaurant.<p>So yes, my argument does apply to eating as well.

Unfortunately a nation's economy is so utterly unlike a household economy that the comparison is downright dangerous, because it leads to harmful false assumptions like ""national debt is <i>always</i> a bad thing"", ""a nation must <i>always</i> 'earn' more than it spends at all times"", and ""an economy can <i>never</i> grow in a nation with debt"".<p>I'm no economic wizard but it really surprised me that how everyone in Europe and many in the States are prescribing austerity, when basic history from this very century frequently demonstrates that austerity can lead to economic damage.  Yes you can always find programs that can and should be cut back in any developed society, but considering debt to be the central and only problem in a situation where the debtor defines the very money it ""owes"" seems a little shortsighted to me.",1357265898

When you want to classify a new document, you can use its contents (more terms) to calculate a feature vector.<p>(The math seems to typically involve random initialization followed by iterative improvements. Other work in the field discusses the specifics.)<p>The matricies are ""nonnegative"" because, conceptually, features are a _positive_ thing, and you can't say that a certain term makes something <i>less</i> a member of a feature cluster (only more).<p>The tricky part is figuring out how to map features to things which are semantically interesting to your application, and I don't want to comment too much on the state of that because it's been five years and I honestly forgot what exactly we did there, and it was all done in Matlab (which I'd never used before), and there's probably more recent work in the field.

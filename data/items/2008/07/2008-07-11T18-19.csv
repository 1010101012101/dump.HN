It's a meaningless question.<p>If you have a nice fat profit margin but nobody wants to buy your product, that's no good. If you're selling lots of products but making no profit on it, that's no good either.<p>But if you're like GM, and you're selling millions of units a year, each for tens of thousands of dollars, and you're <i>still</i> not making a profit, I think we can diagnose the problem as being in the margins, not in the sales.<p>Seriously though, if you want to go on a whine about how bad American cars are, I suggest the comments at autoblog.com which are suitable for that kind of inanity.

On ycombinator, you can still get a scathing review from a 17 year old startup wannabe and then sit there wondering whether they really know what they're talking about.<p>3) non-disclosure; when you post on ycombinator, your business plan reaches a public audience and gets indexed on google.

We measured the period of the pendulum using our heartbeats, and we also measured how long it took things to roll down differently sloped ramps. From this we derived the period of the pendulum and the relationship between slope and speed. Eventually we used this to derive the universal law of gravitation using the period of the moon's orbit as the only given. It was pretty cool because there was no math involved. Instead of using calculus to derive the equations, we instead found them inductively by iterating over a couple thousand lines in excel and then looking for the pattern. The idea of the class was to understand physics by deriving all the equations the same way the people who discovered them did. It was pretty cool.",1215800188

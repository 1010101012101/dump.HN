I know a few people who have done this -- and have done something similar myself.<p>Most colleges have an Art department that offers something like Graphic Design. I would personally suggest concentrating in something like Studio Art, rather than Graphic Design specifically. You'll still pick up the same tools, but it will come from a different angle.<p>Also, Communications departments (and/or Journalism, specifically,) are very good at being up to date at technology; advertising relies on technology to work nowadays.",1301893178

2405426,comment,2403031,2403031,2,0,scottchin,,,"I am about to defend my Ph.D. thesis in a few weeks. I'm in the area of comp/elec engineering, VLSI chip design stuff. Here is my advice from my personal experience. I typically tell people to not go for a Ph.D. unless they are convinced that it is required in whatever career path they want (for example, becoming a tenured professor, or specific type of research position in industry).<p>From the way you phrased your question, it depend on what you deem as a ""good job offer"".  In terms of salary, the typical wage difference between Ph.D. and MS is not that big (in my field). You are also not earning for the time in which you pursue the Ph.D. (5 years maybe). As an example, most of my friends that did their M.S. with me went straight into industry.  They are all in some form of technical lead/managerial role (higher pay) and had been earning a good salary the whole time.
Also being a post-doc is not something you would want to aim for.  It's more of a limbo position with poor pay.  If you are talking about ""interesting"" work, then Ph.D. can open doors but it depends on your specialized area.<p>That being said, completing a Ph.D. will make you an expert in your field. If that field has strong industry ties, you will likely come out with many contacts through networking at conferences and events, possibly collaborating with industry members, possible research internships, etc. This will lead to job opportunities.<p>And as others have said, Ph.D.s are not for the faint of heart. For me, Ph.D. was similar to M.S., but with a longer term, slightly more risky project. So think about how you liked your M.S. experience. Your overall experience will also depend highly on your supervisor's personality, and how disciplined and motivated you are. I tend to think that I am a bit on the un-disciplined side, but I am very fortunate to have an extremely good mentor/supervisor. :)<p>If you want to chat further, feel free to post here or send me an email. :)",1301892838
2405425,comment,2405379,2405379,3,0,zaidf,,,"Wow, such a good question.<p>First things first, specific to design, almost no one cares about your degree in design. Almost everyone cares about your portfolio. Very, very few clients that I've done design work for even asked for a resume. Almost all ask for a portfolio right after the ""hello"".<p>I think if you do a real study of the best designers, you'll find that very few have a degree that has ""web design"" in it. A lot of the designers I know from school had a journalism/ad degree with a media concentration.<p>About pay - your average web designer does not make much. I do a lot of contract work for design and programming and when I quote the same rate for design as programming, clients balk at it. One prospective client said how he is paying about 20/hr to a local designer. I simply cannot compete with that and probably wasn't a best fit for his project.<p>Now, what do I mean? I think the designers who do pull dough transition into UX/product. Now you are no longer being hired to convert psds into html but figure out what you can do to the design to increase conversion or engagement etc. Some may argue that doing that job is no longer design. May be or may be not...it's mostly semantics.<p>So if you are into design, also play with the idea of learning programming(jquery?) and marketing(seth godin, ab testing etc.). The two complement design very well and make you stand out from the run of the mill designers.<p>Also, a warning about simply picking a program based on your hobby. My hobby was programming all through high school but I hated comp sci-related stuff in college. That says more about me - I enjoyed the freedom that came from self-learning programming on projects I enjoyed. I did not enjoy programming in a specific textbook order full of theory. Note, I do believe if you do want to pursue a serious programming career, a degree in comp sci can help you more than hurt you. But just know what you are signing up for by reading through the curriculum and talking to alums!<p>Similarly, most design programs would want you to develop drawing and other artistic skills that may have little to do with <i>your</i> interest in design. Be sure you can slog through it and not let that make you hate design(the worst case scenario).",1301892769

2405372,comment,2404632,2405211,2,0,guptaneil,,,"Based on your logic, calculators shouldn't have ever been introduced in the classroom either because an abacus filled our needs. Or perhaps 128k of memory really was enough, since what possible use could we have for more memory or advanced technology if the status quo fills our current needs?<p>We are just beginning to untap the possibilities of mobile devices in the classroom, and to completely dismiss them as ""nifty tech"" is very short sighted. People tried to do the same ten years ago when laptops started appearing in classrooms. Had they succeeded, companies like Google would not even exist today.<p>We are seeing many interesting uses of mobile devices in education now that the devices are finally appearing in classrooms. However, until they become more ubiquitous and accepted, it will be impossible to fully demonstrate how much they can impact education.<p>Having spoken to professors who have personally experimented with iPads in classrooms, I can tell you it makes a day and night difference just in student engagement when they are given a textbook to study from versus being encouraged to explore a topic and discuss it using mobile devices like the iPad. I've observed biology classes where roughly half of the students used an iPad. These students consistently participated more than the other students. There are several reasons for this behavioral change, but I think the most important one is the design of the device and OS. It focuses on the single task at hand. When an app becomes the whole device and actually discourages multitasking, students pay attention more compared to their distracting laptop screens. Compared to laptop users, they also benefitted from a lack of a physical barrier from the laptop screen between the student and instructor. Those students that had no electronic device and just depended on the textbook generally participated the least and seemed least interested. It will be interesting to see how these devices continue to change how classrooms operate as more and more schools open up to the idea.<p>Keep in mind that the target audience is not tech savvy nerds, but the typical student, who for the most part is still afraid of using traditional laptops. These students, however, live off of their cell phones, so why not take advantage of an environment they are already comfortable in to encourage learning instead of forcing them into a foreign environment?",1301891116

The founding fathers implemented a government as best they could using information available at the time. It's now 2011 and  we've experienced a technological revolution. If we were to design a new government using today's technology, how would it be different?<p>This question is both exciting and depressing. On one hand there is so much potential to improve  the way humans interact and direct resources. On the other hand, it doesn't matter what solution is found, because governments exist outside any  market. Steve Jobs could have designed the most brilliant Constitution of his  time, but it wouldn't matter because following a new constitution would still be considered illegal.<p>Given I'm a dreamer, why not imagine. The weakest component of a fighter jet is the human pilot. Now we have jets without human operators. I believe the weakest component of our government is also the human. Humans experience emotions, are susceptible to bribes, and aren't consistently reliable. Why not use computers to cut out the middle man, drive down costs, and increase satisfaction? Imagine how algorithms can be used to implement real-time, direct democracy. Imagine how multi-factor authentication can be used to ensure voter authenticity. Laws can be applied to geographical zones, while zones are dynamically created based on voter attributes and commonalities. Computers have restore points, so should governments. If the State gets our of control, a roll-back function could be implemented. Fact is there is infinite room for improvement.<p>If government is a service it should be a commodity. The best and brightest should be competing to write the most effective government. Its unfortunate were content with our one party system.

I have reproduced parts of it that I found interesting (Heavily edited for telegraphic brevity):<p>&quot;Like many of America’s new generation of users, Ms Scudo&#x27;s ddiction began in 2000 when, after a hip injury, a doctor prescribed her ... a high dose of OxyContin.. Her prescription was later reduced, but she was already hooked. On the black market OxyContin pills cost $80 each, more than she could afford to cover her six-a-day habit; so she began selling her pills and using the proceeds to buy cheaper heroin. As if from nowhere, Ms Scudo had become a heroin addict.&quot;<p>&quot;last year 11m Americans used illicitly-acquired prescription painkillers, more than the number who used cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and LSD combined.&quot;<p>&quot;Though Afghanistan accounts for 80% of global opium production, America gets most of its heroin from Mexico. Mexico is now the world’s third-biggest producer of opium, after Afghanistan and Myanmar.&quot;<p>&quot;More than half are women, and 90% are white. The drug has crept into the suburbs and the middle classes. And although users are still mainly young, the age of initiation has risen&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21633819-old-sickness-has-returned-haunt-new-generation-great-american-relapse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21633819-old-sic...</a>",1420693104

Case (1): Lots of people got it besides the hostages, but there&#x27;s nothing to blow the whistle on. It&#x27;s not as if the message says, &quot;Raid at dawn&quot;.

The classic example is to take an orange peel and flatten it.  It&#x27;s impossible to do without tearing or distorting in one way or another.  The Earth is of course a 3d shape, and maps are 2d, thus projections to try and map the world as accurately as possible.  However, it gets more complicated when you project the data, going back to the distortion.  It becomes a problem of &quot;Pick 2 out of 3.&quot;  That usually means Area, Shape and Direction.  You can have an accurate representation of Area and Shape, but not Direction.  Or in the case of Mercator, Direction and Shape, but not size.  Mercator was used by ocean going navigators so that they could draw a straight line on their navigation charts (as longitude and lattitude lines are represented by rectangles with 90 degree angles).  Since then of course, we now have thousands of different projections, used for different purposes so that we can try and create the most accurate mapping of the &quot;real&quot; world as we can.  And of course, the projection you choose, should hopefully help you in accurately communicating that geographic information to others.  I hope that all makes sense.",1420691775

8855011,comment,8852498,8852498,0,0,philwelch,,,"This reminds me of the first lab assignment of my OS class. Ah, here it is (but don&#x27;t trust this link: the professor takes it down and puts it back up again with slight changes every term): <a href=""http://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/LAB1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/LAB1.html</a><p>Interesting notes about this class:<p>1. This is the second of two one-semester systems programming classes. In the first semester, you learn how to implement ext2. The bootloader assignment is mostly a minimal refresher of the same subject, so you&#x27;re expected to have remembered from last semester how to traverse the filesystem.<p>2. You have to write the whole boot loader yourself, aside from some assembly code you&#x27;ve been provided. It runs in 16-bit mode, so you can&#x27;t use gcc, at least not easily. You use bcc; Bruce&#x27;s C compiler, which doesn&#x27;t really read ANSI C.<p>2a. This actually continues throughout the entire class, during which you will eventually build an entire kernel, in 16 bit x86, using Bruce&#x27;s C compiler. I don&#x27;t know who Bruce is, but the professor apparently thought that 32-bit mode did too much of the work for you and wanted us to understand how to do some of the stuff (i.e. switching between kernel and user mode, I think?) ourselves.<p>2b. Bruce&#x27;s C compiler lacks a lot of interesting features of more modern C compilers, like function signatures. In Bruce&#x27;s C compiler, much as in early dialects of C, you can call any function you want and pass whatever arguments you want; the only thing the function does is read it off the stack. Downsides: whatever paltry type safety you get from C is gone; you can pass a long to a function that expects a short and it&#x27;ll just grab enough bits off the stack to make a short. Upsides: variadic functions, like printf, are marginally simpler to implement; when they released some of the very earliest C/Unix code, I found that my printf had a very close resemblance to the original.<p>3.

But unless you wish to argue that the level of pain that requires opioid pain killers has consistently been increasing and almost tripled since 1991[2], you&#x27;ll have to face the idea that maybe doctors have gotten quite a bit more liberal with the rx pad. 207 <i>million</i> opioid prescriptions per year really seems a bit over the top, no?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/overdose/facts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/overdose/facts....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2014/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/t...</a>",1420690324

Then 6 months ago I just walked into the gym and hired a personal trainer on the spot. I&#x27;ve been working out 3-4 times a week since. Now it feels weird if I miss a day. So far I&#x27;ve lost 35 pounds, 6 inches from my waist, and my bodyfat % is down from 26% to 21%. The hardest part was just walking into the gym that first day.",1420690300

8854944,comment,8853062,8854814,0,0,GabrielF00,,,"One of the biggest complaints that I hear from literary figures is that people are not reading. E.g. Philip Roth saying that the number of serious readers in America is going to drop to almost zero. So I would imagine that readers being able to find whatever book they want wherever they are located and buy it instantly would remove some of the barriers to reading. I would also imagine that having cheaper books would encourage people to buy more. And I think that all of the other new ways of getting books to people (Audible for example) are also vehicles to get people reading.<p>I also think that ebooks open up a lot of possibilities for experimentation. For instance, in the past it may not have made a lot of financial sense to write a 60 page novella - you couldn&#x27;t really put it on a shelf in a bookstore by itself, it would have to be packaged with other work. But with an ebook there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t write a 60 page novella and charge $3 for it.<p>I think a good analogy is print journalism and commentary vs web journalism and commentary. There&#x27;s a lot more crap on the web, and a lot of the traditional institutions are hurting, but there are also so many more opportunities for new voices and for innovation.",1420689984

This means that artists are having to take up all this slack instead of just focusing on their work.

Fatigue.<p>That pop music, &quot;wall of loud sound&quot; album was tolerable for a few hours at age 20, gets tiresome at 40, and could be almost painful at age 60.  Hearing is a mechanical process, and worn out mechanical parts tend to rattle, lose response, etc... and this is fatigue.<p>People will respond with something like, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of hearing&quot;, and to them, the experience of hearing is no longer transparent at higher volumes and longer times.<p>2.  Less dynamic range possible / pain<p>Think of it like gamma for displays.  There is a curve of sensation to input sound in db.  People tend to vary a lot, but this curve gets bent away from the normal to a condition that is a lot like &quot;crushed black&quot; and white, where the upper limit of sound volume perception gets distorted.<p>An unimpaired person can tell the difference between 60, 80, 100db.  People who have aged and have losses, may not be able to tell much difference between those volume levels, resulting in &quot;all loud sounds are just loud&quot; not different amounts of loud.<p>Also think of banding when color depth is reduced.  Rather than a nice, smooth response, the listener gets more steps, or various steps may all present in ways that are similar when they should be easily distinguished.<p>A related thing is discrimination, and it happens with pitch in the same way that it can happen with volume.  Loss of pitch discrimination means being unable to distinguish between close frequencies, hearing them as one, or perhaps just as a muddled combination, not as two distinct tones.<p>This is subtle, and it can happen with most other responses being normal.  But the person just can&#x27;t quite pick out the sounds, despite hearing them individually just fine.  It&#x27;s the combinations they struggle with.",1420689711

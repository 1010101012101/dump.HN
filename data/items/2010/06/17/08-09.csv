If you like chasing new shiny things all day, sure.<p>Javascript is a great language, no doubt, but for me, it lacks a lot of the things Java does so well to ensure that things don't break, finding bugs easy, etc etc<p>Why are so programmers so fashion conscious though? Do we write programs to solve problems, or do we write programs to be fashionable.<p>If we write to solve problems, then use Java5. Use BASIC. Who cares if it solves the problem well. If you write to be fashionable, then sure, use <NEW SHINY THING THAT REINVENTS THE WHEEL BUT ISN'T UP TO MUCH YET>. People will marvel over your great fashion sense, but will it solve the problem even as well as a less fashionable approach?<p>The amount of man hours wasted on reinventing the wheel in programming languages is staggering.

If your world consists solely of shuffling bytes around a network then node.js may be a good solution, but it doesn't extend much further than that. For example, I wouldn't want to write a machine learning algorithm in Javascript, nor would I want to write a storage engine, nor a ... you get the idea. Furthermore, while node.js may be growing quickly (easy when you're small!) the development of the Javascript language is taking a rather torturous route as the various vendors play games at the Ecmascript table.<p>To return to the article, what I really want from both the JVM and Javascript is tail recursion. I'd also like proper lexical scoping in Javascript, though that isn't so important. I don't view Java or Javascript as languages you write but rather languages you compile to (well, you compile to bytecode for the JVM, but hopefully you get my point). Scala and Clojure make mighty fine Java replacements; I haven't seen anything yet for Javascript that is much of an improvement.",1276764319

On hardware, Apple is fighting harder than last time.<p>> Microsoft actively courted developers, by providing them with a strong toolchain and turning them loose on the platform. Apple sacrificed developers on the altar of user experience.<p>Now, Apple can actually stop you selling your software on their platform, in an instant - power only to be dreamed of in 1985! Add to that, the ban on Flash that is forcing developers to do twice the work or only support the dominant player (Apple.) They did the same with the Mac, no cursor keys and so on, but this time it's even stricter. No Google Voice, no way to run the same code on iPhone and Android, no apps that infringe on Apple's ever-moving goalposts...<p>Apple has not given up on the strategy they tried with the Mac.

The village elders gather around the monk and cry ""oh no, how terrible! isn't this sad for the boy to break his leg?"" To which the monk replies ""perhaps it is, perhaps it is not"". The elders walk away in bemusement. A week passes and the despot ruler of the kindom declares war against a peaceful neighbor. Soldiers come to the village to round up all the able young men to fight. The boy with the broken leg is passed over.

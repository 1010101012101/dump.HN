I was mostly focused on having a good evaluation.  I know a lot of my competitors did that, though, but without changing the evaluator it is, as I said, self-deluded.<p>> For example the expected value of moving up and left should be the same as the the expected value of moving left then up?<p>That isn't true; that ends up with the wall from the middle move in a different spot.<p>At any rate, there was a lot I could have done to improve the search speed/depth but I didn't have time, so instead I worked on a better evaluator.<p>It was pretty interesting -- I would frequently see stronger moves (as best I could tell, after analyzing a losing game) found at shallower levels of search depth discarded in favor of weaker moves at deeper levels.  Presumably it assumed the opponent would maximize its Voronoi territory at a time when it was actually a bad thing to do.",1267804722

If you change the backing class from one type to another, but you were using an interface to access it, then the Java compiler doesn't need to recompile that code -- the compiled InvokeInterface bytecode for that method invocation doesn't change. However -- I feel like I may have read this somewhere -- there are optimizations which might cause it to replace InvokeInterface with static invocations when it can determine at compile time what class is used. If that's the case, then it would have to recompile the client class too.",1267804694

1169607,comment,1169352,1169487,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> 9800GTX+ (for some reason the drivers identify it as a 250GTS)<p>It's because it's the exact same card. On most rebrands, at least they bother to change the relevant identifiers, but 9800GTX+ differs from a GTS250 only by the number on the box. As such, the drivers have no way of knowing which of them you have -- they cannot even make a solid guess from batch numbers because unsold 9800GTX+ were repackaged as GTS250's. Faced with this, the driver programmers decided that less people would probably complain if they just called all the cards by the latter name.<p>Fun fact -- differently harvested versions of the G92 chip have been sold as:<p><pre><code>     - GeForce 8800 GT   $2
     - GeForce 8800 GS   $1
     - GeForce 8800 GTS
     - GeForce 9600 GSO  $1
     - GeForce 9600 GSO ASUS 512 $$
     - GeForce 9800 GT   $2
     - GeForce 9800 GTX
     - GeForce 9800 GTX+ $3
     - GeForce 9800 GX2
     - GeForce GTS 150
     - GeForce GTS 240
     - GeForce GTS 250   $3
     - GeForce GT 330
</code></pre>
Groups marked with $n are all <i>exactly</i> the same card, with no differences whatsoever. Many other sets have only very minor differences. $$ denotes the biggest ripoff award -- halved memory bus width and cheap memory make this card only half the speed of the normal 9600 GSO.<p>So, if you wonder why NVidia is swimming in cash, it's because G80, and it's slightly modified shrink G92, are insanely good designs. G80 debuted in late 2006 and G92 in late 2007, and it's still selling.",1267804232

1169579,comment,1168969,1169417,0,0,dkarl,,,"My first thought was satire.  Since there are a couple good rules, my second thought was troll.  But this is also a new twist on an old bit of link-bait:  it's the narcissistic sociopath fantasy applied to business instead of dating.  Given the last sentence of the first paragraph, it might be meant satirically.  (If so, it failed.  Satire makes something impossible to take seriously, but this post evokes the opposite reaction:  I can't believe we have to take this shit seriously.)  So I think this is a trollish satirical representation of the arrogant sociopath model of dating.<p>Anyway, it does have some interest, since the limitations of the arrogant sociopath model are more obvious in the business context than in dating.  People looking for dating advice are, for various reasons, willing to ascribe all kinds of weird thought processes to women.  With business, we all know a little too much to swallow this.  For example, it's obvious that rule 6 is a perfect recipe for impressing dumb people quickly while screwing up a situation.  Better have a good exit strategy when your unwillingness to listen to nagging doubts, or your inability to <i>have</i> doubts, finally catches up to you.  God, I hate working with people who follow rule 6, because the only way to pull it off is to be blindly, willfully stupid.  (Good people who try to follow rule 6 are known as workaholics.)<p>Number 5 just makes you autistic or a belligerent dick unless you really have the ""strength"" you're advertising.  Advertising dominance that you haven't earned has only four possible effects:<p>1.  You look autistic.<p>2.  You look like a belligerent dick.<p>3.  You make yourself a target of other belligerent dicks.<p>4.  You fool stupid people.<p>#4 is supposed to be the key to swimming in poontang, since women (of course) are not only ruthless and overly emotional but also complete idiots.  Who cares if most people think you're an ass if you get to bang a few hot, damaged bottle blondes, right?  Okay, even granting that this might actually work in real life dating, how the hell is this supposed to work in business?  You only do business with easily bluffed idiots?  Right, all those insanely rich and successful easily bluffed idiots who have all the money and connections you want.",1267803574

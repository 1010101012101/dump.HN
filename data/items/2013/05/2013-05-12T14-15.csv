It was a high-yield dwarf wheat that had short, stronger stalks so it could support a larger head, which enabled it to grow in famine stricken areas.<p>Now 99% of the world's wheat is the a descendant of this semi-dwarf strain. However, the chemicals used to process  wheat today are potent, and the wheat we consume today is not like the wheat people consumed 100 years ago.<p>Last year I cut out wheat from my diet and dropped ~80 lbs -- I'm back down to 180. At first I thought it was exercise/sprints, and while I have no doubt this helped, I haven't been exercising much the last few months and I'm still dropping. Maybe it's the gluten in the wheat or maybe it's something else, but it definitely wasn't working for me.<p>While I haven't read it, evidently Dr. William Davis' book ""Wheat Belly""  explains this in detail (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wheat-Belly-Lose-Weight-Health/dp/1609611543"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Wheat-Belly-Lose-Weight-Health/dp/1609...</a>).",1368370722

5694455,comment,5693881,5693881,4,0,cosmie,,,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about how GA tracks user engagement, which is understandable as even the Support article linked in another comment doesn't accurately explain what happens with single page visits.<p>First off, the metric by definition will always be skewed lower than reality. For multi-page visits, GA takes the time of the first hit and time of the second hit to calculate time on page (and will chain these together to get time on site). Since the page the user leaves on doesn't have a ""second hit"", that time is never included.[1]<p>For single page visits, as blog posts tend to be, the calculation is slightly different.[1]<p><pre><code>   Time on Page = (time of last engagement hit on page)  (time of first hit from page)
</code></pre>
If you set up Event Tracking to trigger as a user scrolls to predetermined lengths of your article, it'll trigger these 'engagement hits' and give you a better approximation of time on site.  If you just throw in a standard tracking code that fires off a _trackPageview() event on page load, then GA will never see a second engagement and will not be able to calculate any approximation of time on page/site, so it'll default into the ""less than 10 seconds"" bucket. Depending on what blogging platform you're using, there are some add-ins that provide such functionality.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/29/understanding-google-analytics-time-calculations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/29/understanding-google-anal...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.analytics-ninja.com/blog/2012/06/google-analytics-bounce-rate-demystified.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.analytics-ninja.com/blog/2012/06/google-analytics...</a>",1368370384

He reported 6k of 6.8k[1] leaving within 10 seconds and I saw that 11k of 13.5k[2] left within 10 seconds.<p>If these numbers aren't accurate due to Google Analytics, I'd be interested to know a way to get the accurate numbers.<p>The other annoying thing was that, HTTPS never sends referrers. Hence, not a single one of my visits said it was from Hacker News.<p>I know, you don't want to leak the referrer in most circumstances when it's HTTPS, but it just seems so vital. The Internet was made and understood by referrals and links, lacking an ability to see referrers seems quite unfortunate, especially if all the Internet ends up HTTPS.<p>Google and Facebook are the only ones who would be able to stitch together significant portions of referral traffic due to Google Analytics or Facebook Like / Connect.

We've seen three models:<p>1. Public financing. This is the most successful; even if there's a reputation of bureaucracy and mediocrity (largely because public schools have to contend with the full range of inputs) the system actually works extremely well. A lot of people (read: short-sighted conservatives) just don't want to pay for it, so they gripe about the public-school model itself, rather than (admittedly, serious) issues with execution.<p>2. After-the-fact donations. The problem here is that it converges on a Nash equilibrium where the rich get the resources <i>anyway</i> because they are most likely to be future donors. (Depressing news: in spite of the ""economic miracle"" that college is supposed to work, but hasn't for a long time, the #1 predictor of whether someone will be wealthy is having wealthy parents.)<p>3. Non-dischargeable debt. Student debt might have been a good idea (a) before it started having effects itself on pricing --making college again unaffordable and replacing minor debt loads with indentured servitude-- and (b) were the economy less volatile than it has been since 1990 or so. It's horrible now.<p>None of these solutions (of the three, public financing being the only one that works) admit themselves well to the startup business model.",1368369726

The hundred million people killed during the world wars died because of decisions and actions taken by governments, not farmers in Germany, teachers in Japan, taxi drivers in New York or restaurant owners in London.  War is one of the most regrettable failures of our collective approaches to government.<p>As for the rest, read the Allegory of the Cave.  Someone who only knows shadows does not know reality.

5694278,comment,5693679,5694171,7,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Here's a hint for you. Natural does not mean healthy and without side effects. When you are eating a lifeform that contains myriads of chemicals in its purely natural makeup, you have no idea what you are eating. (Often, with herbal medicines, this proves to be an issue, and they get yanked off sale for side effects.) Ironically, it is precisely the <i>synthetic</i> chemicals that you can look up on wikipedia. And if you live long enough, immersed in this flow of entirely natural chemicals and radiation, yourself made of complicated and imperfect chemical reactions, you too will get cancer. (Actually, your body is cancering (deliberate verb coinage) all the time, and nearly always its repair mechanisms catch it early and stop it. It's that ""nearly"" that's the trouble.)<p>But hey, facts, harder to process than irrational fear of the new, and a crude prescientific search for ""purity"".",1368367886
5694277,comment,5694059,5694059,4,0,4ad,,,"I found the house I currently live in with regular expressions.<p>A couple of years ago I moved to a different country, and for some reasons I needed <i>two</i> apartments, preferably close to each other. As you can imagine, the real estate websites are not designed for the kind of query I needed, so I wrote some code to aid me in my quest[1].<p>It's just shell script and text processing with awk. I download various results with all the available apartments for many real estate websites, then I scrape the data I care about (with regular expressions!) like address, rooms, price, anything really, and query the Google Maps API with all the addresses to retrieve the geographical coordinates, then I compute the distances between any two houses and sort them.<p>It's fantastically modular. Adding support for a new website meant just creating some regular expressions that work for that website. This was great because I was doing this on the road, as I was visiting the foreign city and found new sources of information.<p>Regular expressions were also great because these websites didn't have any API where I could query for the address, etc. I had to rely on what <i>people</i> wrote in their ads. This meant that when I wrote a regexp to match a set of results I had to inspect the failures to see new ways people described their houses and improved my matching based on that. Initially I had hoped I'd be able to parse 80% of the ads, but measurements and careful coding had allowed me to match approximately 99% of the ads!<p>The textual operation of this software allowed me to easily input some data manually. For example I realized that I'm also interested in having these apartments close to a subway station. No problem, just manually create the file with the subway stations in the correct, simple, textual format and the program will pick it up and use automatically.<p>The textual interface also helped with fancy queries, like ""price between X and Y, 6 rooms total, prefer 4-2 to 3-3 if distance less than D, but 3-3 if distance greater than D, prefer Z subway line to Q, only one apartment might be from an agency rather than an individual, try to put one in K part of the city"".

If you plan to make an exit, then you're not really there to support the next generation of people who want to learn. You're not a teacher or educator if you're there only to make the jump up to the next thing.<p>In that sense, the idea of passionate angels, and small startups that can find a niche and build a sustainable business out of it makes a lot of sense.

Since a bug report with a comprehensive steps-to-reproduce is more likely to get addressed than one with an ASM trace, it makes sense to focus effort there.<p>Or, it may be that they&#x27;re clock punchers/overworked, and tracing someone else&#x27;s code jeopardises them leaving on time/shortening their &quot;in&quot; tray.",1419681436
8802344,comment,8797590,8801880,0,0,alangpierce,,,"Thanks for the thoughts. I&#x27;ve worked with Go enough that I know pretty much all of the language features, but not enough to be comfortable with idiomatic programming, so it&#x27;s nice to see a more experienced perspective.<p><i>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but this doesn&#x27;t seem that hard in Go. Plugin 1 can add a new type which implements whatever interfaces it wants to. Plugin 2 can add a new interface which other people can implement, or not, as they choose. Once you get away from the idea of type hierarchies, this stops being difficult.</i><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s not so hard if you allow operations to be optional, but I think there are some cases where you can&#x27;t get away with that. As a more concrete example, let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re writing a flexible compiler and we&#x27;re hoping to provide two extension points:<p>* People should be able to add support for additional architectures. They do this by writing a new function (or something conceptually equivalent) that takes a syntax tree and outputs a list of instructions in some particular instruction set.<p>* People should be able to extend the language by adding new syntactic elements (new cases for a syntax tree node).<p>If one plugin adds do-while loops and a completely separate plugin adds ARM support, there won&#x27;t be any code for compiling do-while loops to ARM, so the compiler would simply be broken for that case (there&#x27;s no acceptable &quot;default behavior&quot;). But I think that&#x27;s a fundamentally hard problem that can&#x27;t be solved with any language feature.<p>But if we assume that only one plugin is allowed (or that plugins have a strict ordering), then I think either of the solutions you mentioned (type switch or wrapper types) sound pretty reasonable, and they&#x27;re more flexible than sum types because sum types would force the syntax tree format to always stay the same. Still, I don&#x27;t think any of these solutions is perfect. For example, when using wrappers, the Sum, Mul, and Eq cases would still point at the non-wrapped types, so I think you&#x27;d have to do a bunch of conversions. With the type-switch (but only for plugins) approach, the built-in x86 code generator would be implemented in a completely different way from the ARM code generator plugin, which seems weird to me. Also, neither of your approaches has a way to enforce at compile time that every case was handled/wrapped.",1419681379

8802312,comment,8798651,8798651,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"(As much as I hate to post twice on a thread, I&#x27;ve had some thoughts that I haven&#x27;t seen expressed yet.)<p>I think a lot of folks are missing some important perspective on the origin and rise of &quot;agile&quot; and the current state of process in the software industry. So let&#x27;s take a quick trip back to the bad old days before agile to get a sense of what software development was often like back then.<p>First off, a lot of software was developed &quot;out of house&quot; so to speak, as works for hire by consultancy type companies. There would be extensive negotiations between the customer and representatives of the development company, the end goal of this process was typically a specification and a timetable that was then mutually agreed upon, through a legally binding contract, as to what would be built.<p>Next, the development company would take that specification and come up with a design that would be able to match the specs. Then that design would be sliced up and handed out to various teams and eventually down to individual devs. After the individual coding was done it&#x27;d be integrated together and compiled into a working product. The product would then be passed off to QA to test in order to make sure it didn&#x27;t have any bugs and that it matched the spec. After that the product would then be passed on to the customer to use.<p>And everyone lived happily ever after.<p>Of course, there are a few problematic aspects to this process. Namely: everything. Usually what would happen is that the spec and/or the design would be unrealistic or impossible to implement, and wouldn&#x27;t be what the customer actually wanted regardless. Often this was handled by acrimonious bouts of negotiation, often involving lawyers. Meanwhile, attempting to build anything that worked at all using this sort of process was a nightmare. When the software was integrated only at the last minute there were always a million new problems discovered. With such &quot;big-bang&quot; integrations a lot of effort is spent spinning away just getting the software to build and work at all. Meanwhile, when QA is the last step before handing the product off to the customer that means that defects, especially design defects, have had the greatest amount of opportunity to fester and take the most effort to remove. And, of course, the chance that the project would chew up many staff-years of effort without actually producing anything of use whatsoever was quite high with this model, since actually building software was a fairly late step.<p>In the face of all these very fundamental problems with the venerable &quot;waterfall&quot; process model a lot of new process ideas started to gain traction, more or less culminating in the &quot;agile manifesto&quot;. The core idea of agility is to use iterative development, continuous integration, and open lines of communication to keep on track. The &quot;customer&quot; (or &quot;stake holders&quot;) can see the direction of the product mid-stream and have many chances to correct communication errors or even errors in their original conception of what they wanted. The software is always being built and always being tested so integration overhead costs are much less severe and defects are spotted much closer to where they are introduced, making them easier to fix. The software is routinely in a &quot;shipable&quot; state with a continually evolving subset of the &quot;final&quot; featureset, this lets the customer see how close the developers are to the schedule and also dramatically reduces the risk of not shipping anything at all. The developers can always time box the release and ship <i>something</i> of value, even if it wasn&#x27;t what was originally intended.<p>And so on.<p>The thing is, today we live in a fundamentally agile world of development. Waterfall is so far from the norm it&#x27;s essentially extinct. The very idea of futzing around with nothing but requirements and specs for months or <i>years</i> before bothering to write a line of code is so anathema to the current standards of software development it seems ridiculous. Everyone knows you start with a skeleton and you flesh it out iteratively. The idea that you&#x27;d have your code base in an unbuildable state, let alone an unusable product state, for more than a few hours or days at most is similarly seemingly preposterous.<p>The fact that the basic principles of agility are now so ubiquitous that they are like a mold infecting every nook and cranny of the software industry is still unsatisfactory for a lot of folks. Management wants a process they can sink their teeth into. They want something that requires no effort on their part but seems like a silver bullet that can solve any problem. They want gadgets and tools. They want a process that they can leverage to justify all of their bad behaviors while removing accountability from themselves. And that&#x27;s what agile-the-noun has become. Not agility, but rather an excuse for micro-management. A way to plan without planning. A justification for short-sightedness and disengagement. A convenient rolodex of excuses for why everyone but management is at fault for being late or building something bad or broken or that no one wants.<p>You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.",1419679702

Then you could have a separate 5000 H1-Bs for foreign companies operating in the US. None of the latter would ACTUALLY be able to hire a single person realistically, because Wipro/Infosys etc would just grab those 5000 completely. But at least the other 50,000 would go towards startups and the Googles/Facebooks/etc of the world hiring foreign talents.",1419678565

Trying to infer an efficient allocation of registers from a chain of stack instructions involves a ton of tricks that bloat the compiler and make loading the bytecode slow and processor intensive.

That is, the <i>real</i> bipolar, which isn&#x27;t what the author is talking about.<p>The kind of behavior referred to in the article is certainly common.  I&#x27;ve know many people who show this &quot;crash and burn&quot; pattern.  Easily bored, distractible, procrastinators to the end.  Black and white, all or none is their theme.  Very good or lousy at any given task, usually performance varies randomly, that being a source of consternation for all involved.  The unpredictability and inconsistency are vexing and corrosive in nearly all domains of life.<p>They may be subject to moodiness, reacting strongly to criticism, and may blow up disproportionately.  Such individuals may become truly depressed but that&#x27;s not usual.  Rather they suffer profound discouragement when things get hard and overwhelming, a state that&#x27;s almost inevitable, if transient, like thunderstorms propagating flash floods of high drama and rapid dissipation.<p>It&#x27;s a condition that often responds to treatment, the right kinds of counseling, in some cases carefully applied medication therapies are useful.  The college-age students who are flailing around struggling to gain traction often respond the best to proper guidance and approaches.<p>The professor observes correctly the tremendous suffering and waste of talent that occurs.  What&#x27;s important is to see it for what it is and having seen it doing the things that can heal it, in the end giving no cause for pessimism at all.",1419678361

On top of it, the driver paid for gas and tolls using an alt route to save money and time. Tolls and gas = $67 (€54). The main route would have cost him $90 (€75), meaning the cost to the pax.<p>It&#x27;s great if there&#x27;s not a lot of &quot;bla-bla-bla&quot; always going on (which happened once, as a driver wouldn&#x27;t stop talking).

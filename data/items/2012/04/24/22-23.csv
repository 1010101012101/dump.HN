3886743,comment,3886396,3886720,12,0,jsprinkles,,,"> I've seen these attacks mitigated single-handedly by an experienced fellow with no access to fancy equipment. I believe it went something like this, change the DNS to point at some EC2 instances to do front-end load balancing with some scripts that detect and drop connections from attacking IP addresses and do severe rate limiting. You can proxy legitimate requests back to the original servers.<p>That isn't how it works, but I appreciate you trying to explain it to me (I have personal experience as a former employee of a hosting company, in this exact position). A typical DoS attack is designed to flood the pipe, usually with UDP. UDP spam attacks are <i>far</i> simpler than layer 7 attacks that you describe, and layer 7 attacks (if small enough) are easier to handle.<p>As a point of reference, I don't even have access to a botnet these days but I could knock your home cable connection offline in about five minutes of my time.<p>In your scenario, if you were to update DNS to point the victim at some EC2 instances, you'd accomplish DoS attacking EC2 instead as they only offer you gigabit connectivity on most EC2 instances. If the DoS attack is multiple gigabit, that isn't going to help you unless Amazon steps in and mitigates about as best they can. A DoS mitigation strategy generally has nothing to do with your application. If an engineer's first answer to a huge DoS attack -- as in, larger than the uplink -- is iptables or ""scripts to detect and drop connections"", that engineer is uninformed. I'm sorry.<p>I have personally witnessed a 40 gigabit/sec attack. I'm sure the smart engineers at CloudFlare have seen bigger. Upstreams don't give a shit what's flowing across the wire, and a small TCP SYN flood directed at your server won't gain any attention from your host or their upstream. A multiple-gigabit attack that takes down the entire uplink will.",1335308024

That uplink has limited capacity. 4gbit, 10gbit...whatever. A big attack can saturate that link completely, so even with the biggest most expensive ""mitigation device"" on the market (some of this gear can get into the hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars for /one/ device, mind you), if a DDoS is overloading your upstream bandwidth providers, you can either have your entire DC brought to a crawl, or null route the site.<p>With that said, how did CloudFlare keep lulzsec up? Anycast, lots of iron, lots of smart technicians, and probably tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in bandwidth fees. TL;DR it was a publicity stunt that they very smartly played up.<p>DDoS is pretty misunderstood, and lots of clients think that there is some magical box that can take all the traffic. Again, if your link is saturated, a ""mitigation"" device can only filter the traffic; your upstream providers can and will take you offline if you don't fix it. Failing that, you get a massive overage bill and every other client at the facility is crawling. It's not really a good solution (mitigation devices /can/ help with smaller attacks, but for the big stuff, null routing is the best solution unless you have something like CloudFlare -- and even they will pull the plug if the attack gets too heavy, because it's simply not worth the expense to them to keep your site online.)",1335307222

Doing so, as you hinted in your own comment, means that large companies have to become skilled investors, and this will inevitably become a significant or even the dominant part of their existence instead of actually making useful things or providing useful services.<p>As we've observed all too recently, not all of those extra investment options are quite as effective as they were supposed to be. Moreover, any investment option that <i>is</i> legitimate could probably offered to (now richer) individual investors if large companies were not allowed to use it. So I'm not sure where the big downside is of restoring the natural links between companies that do socially useful things like make good products, companies that make profits, and companies that are attractive to outside investors when they need extra funding to grow faster.<p>Alternatively, if these companies are going to be allowed to invest their profits on behalf of their own shareholders, perhaps it's about time they were regulated as financial institutions. If nothing else, shareholders should be protected from senior management who are erroneously convinced that they can do a better job gambling^Winvesting their shareholders' profits than the shareholders themselves can do of choosing where to spend a legitimate return on their investment.",1335307192

The cycle is going to be exactly the same.  At one point big music figured out that removing DRM let them sell more songs, and they finally dropped it.  It looks like publishers are starting to realize the same thing.  About time, too--I have an ereader that I like to use but I refuse to buy DRM ebooks on principle, and the selection of unread Gutenberg books is growing rather slim :)<p>Eventually publishers will also bring down the prices of their books ($10-$15 for an ebook? Really?) and discover that they can bring in even more profit.  But that discovery is a year or two down the line still.<p>Thanks Charlie for giving them an eloquent and firm nudge in the right direction!",1335305571

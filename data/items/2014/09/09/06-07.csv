8289050,comment,8288555,8288555,53,0,veidr,,,"I&#x27;ve watched with fascination as the Japanese Senkaku islands slowly and gradually came to be labeled &#x27;disputed&#x27; in the western media, after China&#x27;s recent claims.<p>It seems like China has figured out a way to hack the media (the free media outside of China, I mean -- the government there obviously has root on Chinese TV and newspapers).<p>Japanese ownership of this territory is basically as settled under international law as anything of this nature can be; the islands have been held by Japan since the 1800s, then controlled by the USA for a time after it defeated Japan in WWII, and eventually returned to Japan along with the return of Okinawa.[1]<p>But after China&#x27;s slow and steady media campaign, it has somehow become widely reported as &#x27;disputed territory&#x27;. (Which it is in a meaningless and pedantic sense only.)<p>This island-building is another hack, and maybe a clever one. Killing 70 Vietnamese soldiers in the military action in the 1980s to seize a submerged reef didn&#x27;t make China look good at all.<p>But perhaps by building new &#x27;islands&#x27; to buttress its aggressive and expansionist claims to the territorial waters of other nations, we may end up seeing the western media in ten years uncritically reporting that &quot;China, which has 9 islands in the disputed waters, insists that it is merely defending its territory...&quot;<p>Which is very important, because none of the countries whose territories China is going after -- not even Japan -- would do well in a straight up military conflict. The Philippines only hope is American protection. So the way China&#x27;s aggression is covered in the western media is actually very important.<p>Interesting times.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://csis.org/publication/japan-chair-platform-senkaku-islands-and-international-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csis.org/publication/japan-chair-platform-senkaku-isl...</a>",1410245863

8289028,comment,8284599,8284599,1,0,hypr_geek,,,"Since a year ago upto a few months before, my day was split in half while working on two projects. The first half had me working in C, bash and HTML/CSS, Javascript for an embedded project and the latter half was Java (Android), HTML/CSS and Javascript for a mobile/web project.<p>Nowadays, (moved on to another company) the first half is in Scala (Play), HTML/CSS and Javascript for a web project and the second half in Java (Android) for a mobile project.<p>It has been not been that difficult to manage switching between languages unless the programming paradigm changes (Java <-> Scala), but even that you get used to. The major goal is, in my opinion, to become so proficient with the language(s) that you&#x27;re working with, that it becomes second nature to transform your thoughts to source code. Very much similar to learning a second natural language. It&#x27;s not really necessary to learn the ins and outs of each language that you work with, but at least the stuff that would be required.<p>Some problems that I had,<p>* Realizing it takes time to get used to the context switch.<p>* Using different editors. I was doing C and bash coding in vi, but working and modifying Linux source in KDevelop, mostly due to changes in coding style like tabs vs spaces. Java(Android) coding was in Eclipse and HTML/CSS/Javascript was in Sublime Text.<p>* If you go off one lanugage for a couple of days, it takes some time to get back into it. Doing at least a few things daily keeps one in the flow.<p>* Static compilation helps a lot when we make mistakes after a context switch. Javascript and Bash proved to be a major pain for this (I did try out JsHint for Sublime, but it slowed the system down, so I went back to looking at errors in browser console).",1410245203

8289009,comment,8286616,8287232,1,0,4ad,,,"The number one reason I don&#x27;t use ZFS is that I have to use Linux and OS X. My data at home indeed does reside on ZFS, and I also have a few Solaris machines in the cloud, but a huge part of what I have to do, I have to do on Linux. This is not my decision, and usually I can&#x27;t influence it. ZFS does run on Linux, but it&#x27;s not by default, so from the perspective of the people I have to work with, it could as well not exist.<p>But you asked me only about a single place; my OS X laptop. After I use Solaris for a while (where I have automatic snapshots), when I come back to OS X I feel so weird that I have to remember that I can&#x27;t just delete a file and recover it from a snapshot. Also, I&#x27;ve experienced silent data corruption on my laptops; this would be detected by ZFS (unfortunately it wouldn&#x27;t be solved, as laptops with more than one hard drive are very rare, but with mSATA and a SSD, now there&#x27;s at least a way on some laptops).<p>I also have to run old versions of Go every day; on Solaris I have versions of binaries from every commit and I can just run them to test something. On OS X is more complicated, I use venti, but since it&#x27;s not integrated with the filesystem (because FUSE sucks), as on Plan 9, it&#x27;s more annoying.",1410244730

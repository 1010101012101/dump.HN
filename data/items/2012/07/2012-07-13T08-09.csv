There isn't really a good, cross-browser solution for that that I'm aware of. SVG works to some extent but I don't think it's very easy to work with. Another instance where image-based icons win over font-based icons is when the icon has a lot of small detail. Like a shopping cart (that isn't just a solid, but has the little lines) or an icon representing a list. The lines look imbalanced or one will be thicker than the other. I'm sure this is different across operating systems and browsers but the problem exists. Though you can fix that by never using those icons at a small size.<p>Edit:<p>One thing I hadn't thought of that was brought up by another commenter is that some people override the fonts used in a site's stylesheets and force only their font preference to be used (mostly for readability).

Is it to be expected? Yes.  How do I know it is to be expected?  Because you can easily replicate the situation.  Go to Cancun if you want to see males in their most animal-state.  Is it condonable? I do not know, but it is the way nature made us.  Nature designed us to want reproduce - without our rules, morals, and what-have-you, we would be doing much worse things than asking to see private parts.  Unfortunately, nature also gave us language, which means a lot of times males will utter really stupid things because their sex-drive takes over and their brain reaches a state of near-retardation (hence the popular phrase ""show us your tits"").<p>In shorter words - if you are a female in a bar that is overwhelmingly packed with males -- yes, you should very much expect to get harassed.  Yes, it is not ""right"", but its the way nature made us so there is not a lot of sense in complaining about it.  You could just as well complain about people being obese, because nature designed us to enjoy food.  Am I saying women deserve to be harassed when they dress sexually? No, of course not.

You have no idea? You don't think it might possibly have something to do with sexism in society and in IT culture?<p>From early childhood, girls are taught that the ought to be interested in princesses, dolls, and playing house, while boys are taught that they ought to be interested in LEGOs, trains, cars, building things, computers, math, science, sports, etc. When you go to McDonalds, they ask if you are a boy or a girl, and if you are a girl, they give you a Barbie, while if you are a boy, they give you a car. If for some reason you are a girl and would prefer to play with LEGOs, your peers make fun of you relentlessly. Boys get to play with LEGOs without the stigma. And don't start telling me about reverse sexism and how hard it is for boys who want to play with dolls - the media doesn't portray the gendered interests as separate but equal. It portrays the boys' activities as ""cool"" and the girls' activities as domestic. The grown-up version of playing with LEGOs has much higher social standing in society than the grown-up version of playing with dolls. It is not a valid comparison.<p>It continues from there. Teachers tend to call on boys more often than they call on girls. Boys are taught to be aggressive while girls are taught to be submissive. This leads to aggressive girls being called ""bitches"" while boys who behave the same way are praised for being ""assertive"". The list goes on and on and on, and the only way you could not notice it is if you have the privilege of not having to pay attention because it doesn't detrimentally affect you.<p>And then we have articles like this. Say you're a smart, college-age woman. You are really good at computer science, and you are also really good at, say, writing/things that might be pre-law. You know that if you pursue computer science, you will be one of the only women and will have to put up with the kind of behavior the article talks about, potentially for your entire career, whereas if you pursue law, you will be surrounded by a somewhat even mix of men and women, and that kind of behavior will be much less tolerated.

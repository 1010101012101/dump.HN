10783486,comment,10782762,10782762,0,0,laotzu,,,"Linear hierarchy may have been effective for quick decision making in the age of paper and print but as Marshall McLuhan and Barrington Nevitt point out in their book Take Today: The Executive as Dropout (1972)[1], in the age of electric media distributed networking and flat hierarchies become the most effective organizational form and &quot;Johnny on the spot&quot; is the one who makes the quickest and most accurate decision:<p>McLuhan: Take today means that at the speed of light, today includes all the past that ever was, and all the future, it&#x27;s here now.<p>Nevitt: That is we can retrieve the past, we can be in touch with the present, and the future of the future is the present, so we are in touch with all times now, today.<p>McLuhan: But let us notice that in a world of simultaneous information, you have basically an acoustic world, not a visual world with a point of view, not a positional world from which to look at the future or the past, but an acoustic world in which you are bombarded simultaneously by every kind of data from every direction ... the simultaneity of information means that you live in a world which is simultaneous in terms of its information structure. From every direction you have information electrically. Now this creates a new kind of space.<p>Nevitt: Yes, it is a new kind of space for us and yet an old kind of space for humanity.<p>McLuhan: Well, for pre-literate man.<p>Nevitt: Yes.<p>McLuhan: The space in which we live is identical to the space of pre-literate man, pre-visual man, it is acoustic space.<p>Nevitt: Post-literate space and pre-literate space are similar.<p>McLuhan: Yes but the question that seems not to have entered most minds is, what is the structure of acoustic space? In fact, most psychologists have never heard of acoustic space and they don&#x27;t understand its properties. Its properties are those of a sphere whose center is everywhere and whose margin is nowhere.<p>Nevitt: That is, no boundaries, and no single center, but centers everywhere.<p>McLuhan: centers everywhere, margins nowhere.<p>Nevitt: No points of view. ...<p>McLuhan: The old structure was made up of fragmented specialist jobs.<p>Nevitt: Exactly, and hierarchies of responsibility which were delegated from the top down and channels of communication which were supposed by the organization chart upon which they flow from top to bottom, and bottom to top.<p>McLuhan: So the theme of our book is that you cannot use an organization chart with electric services added.<p>Nevitt: So that &quot;the executive is drop out&quot; means three things, it means first of all: the man who finds himself as top executive in a large organization, gets out of touch with the action, that is, he gets so far out of touch with what&#x27;s happening, that as a human being, he has no more satisfactions in the process. That’s the first thing it means. The second thing is that specialism as a means of coping with this acoustic space, doesn&#x27;t work, that is it has dropped out, it is no longer effective. And the third thing is, that in a knowledge environment, that is where the information is everywhere, like acoustic space with centers everywhere and margins or boundaries are nowhere, then every man knows how to be an executive, and &quot;johnny on the spot&quot; is the man who really makes the decision.<p>McLuhan: Oh, the hijacker is a nice case of a man who wants to be an executive and wants to take over an operation but he also wants coverage, he wants part of that global theatre for himself, he wants to be in the center of the show.<p>Nevitt: And the global theater itself becomes possible, and the hijacker becomes possible only in a world which is such that you are on camera.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTyzjC_s-kk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTyzjC_s-kk</a>",1450881632

Reason being is that followers often try to emulate a process they have no working knowledge of, so their measurements and actionables become cosmetic.  Case in point, in Baltimore, part of the Compstat system measured health of neighborhoods by counting how many basketball courts had hoop nets.  It was a pretty good way to tell what was neglected and where to turn attention to.<p>Within years, people tasked with making actual improvements started gaming the system and driving around and installing basketball hoop nets in community courts.  Let that sink in for a minute.<p>So yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly. Even having all the right information in the universe, a person can still make the wrong decisions.  You are right about that.  If I had all the time to explain my POV, I want to tell you that metrics aren&#x27;t numbers, they&#x27;re patterns.  Anyone looking at them as numbers is doing it wrong.<p>The metrics lag is just one problem with measurements I pointed out because there&#x27;s not enough time and space in the universe to describe them all.  I want to say that a higher sampling speed is always better pretty much everywhere, from SCADA systems in the power industry switching to synchrophasors, to news agencies observing metrics patterns on a daily basis, to cameras recording more frames.<p>Here&#x27;s why- there are some things you can only tell by observing metrics regularly, meaning daily if not hourly because sometimes it&#x27;s just passive information.  From it we could tell when Libya unplugged from the internet back at the onset of the Arab Spring- that was a big deal. They just went dark instantly, overnight.  We could tell when Google+ launched and the Chinese government censors forgot to block ipv6 addresses to it for a few days/weeks and we got unfiltered web traffic from China for a time. We used metrics to make staff shift adjustments because our Asian audiences woke up when our guys went home and the readers didn&#x27;t want yesterday&#x27;s news today.<p>There was a particular lead poisoning story that did very well and got tons of traffic.  However, the traffic sources were viral. If you took the time to exclude non-local traffic, the pageviews were pitiful.  It meant that the local community took no notice of it and we failed to bring the issue to attention of officials in our own back yard.<p>Steering my rant toward my original point.  The leaders that make good use of metrics might just be Besos and WaPo.  Reason being is that while metrics are highly coveted in new media agencies, traditional news agencies have never taken it seriously enough for decision making.  To do that, you have to formally tie numbers and methodology to performance evaluation, and that&#x27;s a huge step.  Fighting local print guilds to make that happen is a herculean task.",1450881285

Do you think it&#x27;s the Democrats? Because &quot;big government and taxes&quot; are also far more effective at <i>creating</i> social problems that local charities. Have you read about the corrosive effects of welfare on black communities? Have you ever joined in complaining about the inability of public school systems to successfully adapt and harness changing technologies? Have you noticed that our biggest social problems just &quot;happen&quot; to also be located right where Democratic policies were <i>enacted</i> (i.e., the policies <i>preceded</i> the social degradation)? All of these things are certainly at least debatable, but they are also certainly not so obviously false that they can simply be discarded without consideration.<p>&quot;Big government and taxes&quot; may <i>theoretically</i> be more capable of solving problems, but there&#x27;s a big gulf between theory and reality.<p>And back on point so this is at least <i>less</i> an off-topic diversion than it otherwise would be, are you A: inclined to agree that hierarchies are bad for cooperation even as B: you declare that the largest hierarchy in the world, &quot;government&quot;, is better at solving social problems than distributed non-hierarchical networks?

The way it works is you can either type in the item-code if you know it, or you can type in search letters which will prompt a browse screen (which is again highly keyboard-friendly).<p>The way it happens in places with low number of SKUs (< 10k) is people who&#x27;re new typically search a lot in the beginning, but over time, they&#x27;ll learn the most frequently used item-codes without any deliberate learning. They also get really fast at the keyboard. This was my experience building DOS-based POS software for small supermarkets and grocery stores.<p>If there are a much larger number of SKUs, or if the item-codes are provided by the manufacturer (like in the automobile spare parts business with 16-digit alphanumeric item-codes), you have to key in them manually.<p>A paint store I built software for had a huge number of SKUs, but they were renowned for their customer experience. This was made possible by putting new employees through a training whose qualifying test is to key-in a bill of materials at a really fast pace.

There would be < 20 manufacturers, of which only 4 or 5 are frequently used. Same for product.

10783277,comment,10782443,10782443,0,0,joveian,,,"I just looked at the DSPS section since that is my problem.  The &quot;I have mathematically proven this to work unless it is your fault&quot; thing is really obnoxious.  I&#x27;ve even tried his ultimate &quot;farmer&#x27;s lifestyle&quot; suggestion that worked for about a year and then stopped working.  Similarly, I&#x27;ve done things like bike around all day then relax without much light in the evening (all after getting less sleep than usual the previous night) all to spend over three hours in bed before getting to sleep.<p>For me, transdermal melatonin patches have been the single most helpful thing that actually improves the quality of my sleep, which seems to be my main issue (I cannot get good quality sleep even if free sleeping on the shifting schedule).  I&#x27;ve been using them (on and off, since I try to use them only when sleeping at night) for a few months now and they aren&#x27;t magic but do seem to help significantly.  Other forms of melatonin, including extended release, have been able to slightly decrease my sleep onset but at the cost of waking up early (about 4 hours after I go to sleep I wake up and can&#x27;t sleep again for at least 3 hours) and they do not improve my sleep quality.<p>Diphenhydramine, even 25 mg or less for weeks at a time, can help me get to sleep but does not improve sleep quality.  I don&#x27;t think it seems to make it worse either.  For most people it stops helping with sleep after a couple of days, but for me I can notice the effects for at least a month and sometimes two (and just a couple of days off can make it effective again).  I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is due to my allergies, which do seem to interact with the circadian rhythm issues.<p>Transdermal melatonin seems to decrease my sleep time and leaves me feeling more rested.  Hopefully this continues and I eventually make up from a really gigantic sleep deficit :/.  One point the author covers but could be emphasised more is that the time you wake up (and potentially but not exactly when actually get out of bed; for me it is easy to tell the effective wakeup time: that is when my allergies kick in) controls the time that you are able to get to sleep.  This took me many years to really understand.  I&#x27;m starting to wonder if the fundamental cause of delayed sleep phases might be related to sleep quality (that is, when quality is sufficiently low our bodies tend to sleep a little longer, but the time from waking to being able to fall asleep doesn&#x27;t change).<p>I don&#x27;t drink alcohol, but on the caffine topic I&#x27;ve noticed that for me caffine (well, theobromine at least) seems to accumulate in my body very slowly, but over weeks of daily consumption even in the morning it will start to affect my sleep.  I find it easiest to avoid almost completely.<p>For me, the longest I&#x27;ve been able to stick to a fairly reliable schedule is three or four months at a time and involves spending at least three hours in bed before getting to sleep almost every day (and twelve hours in bed total most days).  But it is still quite easy to get off that schedule, only partly due to the difficulty of spending that long in bed every day.  On the plus side, I&#x27;ve found that my schedule can actually vary quite a bit day to day while on that general pattern and still be ok, so I don&#x27;t think it is really a matter of being perfectly strict but of avoiding those situations that cause the most harm (e.g. it seems that staying up a few hours later than usual can be ok once a week or so but more often and it can cause the shifting to start again).<p>ETA: Learning to better recognize when I&#x27;ve actually woken up has been one of the most helpful things to me and took forever to recognize even with the allergies to help.  It is very tempting when I haven&#x27;t gotten much sleep (and it is 4 in the morning or something) to try to get back to sleep, but once I&#x27;ve passed that point I can almost never get to sleep again until at least 12 hours have passed.  However, if I stay in bed the effective wakeup time in terms of getting to sleep in the evening can be pushed back, and even more so if I eventually do fall asleep again.<p>Another odity that I&#x27;ve noticed is that I get much more restful sleep when sick for some reason.  I think it may be due to the rapid sleep stage cycling, since there is some other particularly restful type of sleep that occasionally happens in the morning.",1450879418

That seems like it does generate a pretty large image.<p>I figured I&#x27;d take a three-step approach to my first node.js app in Docker:<p>1. Build an image to build my dependencies.  This uses the same base image as step #2 will, but installs all the development tools and libraries (eg. build-essentials, libpq5-dev), and then outputs a .tar.gz to a shared volume containing my node_modules folder.<p>2. Build an image with my dependencies; imports the runtime versions of any libraries (eg. libpq5), imports & expands the .tar.gz generated by #1.<p>3. Build an image with my application, FROM the image in #2.<p>The process is optimized by having the automation check for the existence of #2 by hashing the contents of the relevant Dockerfiles, and the package.json list of dependencies, and doing a `docker pull` with that hash to see if I&#x27;ve already built #2.  If so, my build just needs to build #3.<p>It&#x27;s a bit more complex (Hello, everything in Docker-land), but ends up being pretty powerful.

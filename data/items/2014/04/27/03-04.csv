7653901,comment,7653745,7653838,2,0,kelnos,,,"$100 is certainly a bit on the high side, but I live somewhere where mixed drinks can cost $12 at nicer bars.  Have 5 of those (not unreasonable if you go out around 6pm and stay out until 1-2am), throw in $15 worth of food (as the author mentioned), and you&#x27;re up to $75.  I tend not to go to bars that charge cover, but that could be anywhere from $5-$20, though usually if you arrive at a particular bar before 10pm or so, there&#x27;s no cover charge.<p>So $100 may be <i>slightly</i> hyperbolic, but it can happen without too much difficulty, depending on your tastes.  I happen to really enjoy Scotch, and whiskey in general.  Go to a bar with a selection of mid- to high-end stuff, and that can run you $20+ per pour.  I tend to drink them quite a bit slower, though.<p>But agreed that this doesn&#x27;t answer why he doesn&#x27;t drink <i>at all</i>, but is more an answer to the question of why he doesn&#x27;t &quot;go out drinking&quot;.",1398571197

7653888,comment,7653745,7653777,1,0,kelnos,,,"I (an American) drink fairly often, and occasionally to excess.  I have a fairly high tolerance, so usually I won&#x27;t notice much of an effect until I&#x27;m drinking at a rate of greater than 2 drinks per hour, or, if I&#x27;m drinking slower than that, until I&#x27;ve had at 7+ drinks.<p>So it&#x27;s not unusual for me to go out with some friends, have 5-7 drinks, and not &quot;get drunk&quot;, only developing a slight buzz at most.  As long as I&#x27;m matching each alcoholic drink with 1-1.5 glasses of water, I feel perfectly normal the next day.  (I <i>have</i> noticed that, as I get older, I need to hydrate more and more to avoid a headache afterward.  Annoying.)<p>On other occasions, I do enjoy drinking to a point where I&#x27;d consider myself very drunk.  It&#x27;s <i>fun</i>.  Frankly, I&#x27;m mildly annoyed at the suggestion that the European method of drinking is somehow superior.  It&#x27;s just different.  Possibly healthier, possibly safer, but I&#x27;ll be damned if I let other people tell me how to enjoy myself[1].<p><i>I&#x27;m slightly tempted to write a follow-up article with, &quot;why I don&#x27;t participate in bro culture&quot;, based on this article&#x27;s pervasive reference to clubs, &quot;certain intoxicants&quot;, and other such questionable things the author appears to indulge in, but which seem stupid and harmful to me.</i><p>So wait, indulging in intoxicants other than alcohol makes you a &quot;bro&quot;?  Damn, dude, check your holier-than-thou perceptions at the door and let people do their thing.  I don&#x27;t personally do any of the harder stuff, but I&#x27;m not going to condemn others if that makes them happy.

But I blame the &quot;dinner&quot; more than the &quot;drinks&quot; from a monetary perspective. Nowadays the usual arrangement among my friends & me is that we get together at someone&#x27;s house, one of us cooks, <i>then</i> we go out for a few beers. The food is usually better, and we value the &quot;bar outing&quot; part of the atmosphere more than the &quot;restaurant&quot; part. So we save the $30-50 that the meal costs, which is a huge cash win, much more than saving the cost of a few beers would be.<p>But this is just an issue of where you want to spend your entertainment budget. I personally feel restaurant food is a huge ripoff, and that the ambience of a restaurant is not worth it. While I feel the $1-2 supermarket beer vs. $5-7 for a bar beer is a reasonable incremental price for the ambience. Maybe you feel drinks at bars are a huge ripoff, while restaurant meals are worth it. Spend your money as you wish either way! But then it just becomes an issue of personal budget preferences: I also think movies in theaters are huge ripoffs!",1398570698

7653871,comment,7653723,7653723,6,0,Alex3917,,,"Yet another major fuckup in the education space by Bill Gates. His flagship high school, which he wanted to model every other school in the nation after, literally got shut down after having a graduation rate around 20%. And yet he has yet to pay even a dollar in reparations to all those kids whose lives he destroyed. Diane Ravitch has a good quote about the Gates foundation in her book:<p>&quot;To advance its agenda, the Gates foundation increased its spending on advocacy. From 2005 to 2009, the foundation quadrupled its annual spending on advocacy to $78 million. Accord to Sam Dillon in the New York Times, the foundation will pump an addition $100 million into advocacy over the next five to six years. That kind of money buys a lot of advocacy and support. Gates funded the groups that wrote the Common Core standards, the groups that evaluated them, and the groups that advocated for them. Gates funded liberal groups such as Education Trust, centrist groups such as the Center for American Progress and the Center on Education Policy, and groups on the Right such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, Jeb Bush&#x27;s Foundation of Educational Excellence, and the Media Bullpen. It funded groups that advocated for charter schools, such  as the Education Equality project, and groups that argued against seniority and tenure, such as TeachFirst, TeachPlus, and the New Teacher Project. Kenneth Libby, then a graduate student known for poring through tax filings of foundations and advocacy groups, commented, &#x27;It&#x27;s easier to name which groups Gates doesn&#x27;t support than to list all of those they do, because it&#x27;s just so overwhelming.&#x27; [...]<p>Writing in Dissent, Joanne Barkan described the challenge that the aggressive venture philanthropists pose for American society:<p>&#x27;Can anything stop the foundation enablers? After five or ten more years, the mess they&#x27;re making in public schooling might be so undeniable that they&#x27;ll say, &#x27;Oops, that didn&#x27;t work&#x27; and step aside. But the damage might be irreparable: thousands of closed schools, worse conditions in those left open, an extreme degree of &#x27;teaching to the test,&#x27; demoralized teachers, rampant corruption by private management companies, thousands of failed charter schools, and more low-income kids without a good education. Who could possibly clean up the mess?&#x27;&quot;<p>If you want to read about what happened the last time billionaires got involved with the school system, John Taylor Gatto does a pretty decent job documenting it in his Underground History book.",1398570520

Hell, I&#x27;m officially diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s and I still enjoy those quick interactions. I just happen to be not very good at it.<p>As the article itself suggests:<p><pre><code>    The great thing about strangers is that\n    we tend to put on our happy face when we meet them,\n    reserving our crankier side for the people we know and love.\n</code></pre>\nBut there&#x27;s one thing that the article fails to mention.<p>As an autistic introvert, I&#x27;m still capable of deriving pleasure from talking with strangers from time to time, but the need to put on a happy face and consciously maintain it also puts a great strain on me. Too much mask-wearing makes me exhausted. At the end of the day, I no longer even have the energy to conjure up a passable mask, so I return to my usual cranky self. In other words, the momentary burst of happiness has a significant energy cost, and the ROI for introverts may be much lower (or even negative) than it is for extraverts.",1398570035

7653765,comment,7653164,7653676,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"Agreed about C# multiple interface handling. I&#x27;d really like to see something like that added to Go at some point.<p>In fact it&#x27;s probably not that far away from where Go is now. Go already has something very similar for implicit composition / mixins. Now, if you do something like this:<p><pre><code>  type Foo struct {\n    Bar\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen Foo automatically has the methods of Bar, e.g. Foo.bar() instead of Foo.Bar.bar() although the former is really just shorthand for the latter.<p>If you then have:<p><pre><code>  type Foo struct {\n    Bar\n    Baz\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen assuming that Baz also has the method bar() then you now need to be explicit about it and call Foo.Bar.bar() or Foo.Baz.bar() because the compiler doesn&#x27;t know which one Foo.bar() means.<p>Of course, this is slightly different to interface disambiguation, but there&#x27;s no reason why you couldn&#x27;t have two function definitions with the same name and some added interface qualifier - the functions would then only be callable if the object is cast to an interface. In Go, casting to an interface is a bit like boxing, as it creates a separate vtable for that object&#x27;s methods to match the interface ABI.<p>Hence, you could have say:<p><pre><code>  a := Foo(foo) \n  b := Bar(foo)\n</code></pre>\nNow a has a vtable entry for Foo::foo() -> a.foo() and b has a vtable entry for Bar::foo() -> b.foo().<p>On the other hand, there would be no foo.foo() method unless one were declared separately without any interface qualifier.",1398568533
7653764,comment,7653164,7653406,5,0,skybrian,,,"The advantage is that it allows interfaces to evolve without having to muck around with setting up shared dependencies. In a language like Java, if library A and library B want to share an interface, you have to create library C for the interface and modify A and B to depend on it, and if you want to add a method you have to modify all three at the same time. Furthermore, changing an interface isn&#x27;t backward compatible so the correct way is to create a new interface every time you make a change.<p>In Go, they can both declare the same interface or even skip formally declaring it and just agree to implement the same methods. Furthermore, if one of them decides to implement a new method, the other can just copy the method signature and they stay compatible. This makes it a lot easier to coordinate API changes.",1398568513

But, some are just broken, no sane language released after 1990&#x27;s should not be this broken unless it was on purpose (brainfuck).<p>* Realizing that in practice, currently, there are not too many alternatives and just learning to use it.

Yeah, at some level we want to feel good about the tools we use, so it is harder psychologically to say &quot;this stupid thing I have to use every day&quot;. It goes the other way, just because the language is broken and there is some pure language, re-writing the site into might be very risky.<p>I personally am looking at Dart with excitement but at the same time won&#x27;t be urging anyone yet at work to switch to it yet.

What&#x27;s most needed is a erlang-platform like haskell-platform.... bring together vital tools (proper/dialyer/etc), have a great package index (like hackage/pypi/rubygems) + package manager and have a skeleton project generator (rails-ish) that sets up what was asked for.<p>Convention > configuration<p>The easier it is to get going and contribute, the more people will use it.

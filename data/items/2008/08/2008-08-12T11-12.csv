The builder has been rewritten now to be standalone, so we will soon be testing the difference between current conversion rates of having to create an account and the rates that come as a result of playing with the builder first without an account. If we find anything interesting, we'll make note on Particletree.",1218542073

I particularly liked ""The easiest way to build a product that kicks ass is to start with someone else's great idea (camcorders, for instance), and take stuff away.""<p>I suspect what the ""business correspondent"" wanted to know was something more like:<p>""My customer wants me to build him a new billing system. Their top managers have some defined strategic objectives but no-one I have met seems to actually know what this system should do in any detail. However, they can all detail the bad things that would happen if it did not do (whatever it is) perfectly from day one. Now how do I find out what to build them?""<p>Now that question is the one that development teams face every day.",1218541614

273904,comment,273830,273830,0,0,felixmar,,,"Some of his comparisons are true -- Haskell is relatively hard to comprehend for programmers who are used to imperative languages, but Haskell is imo the best language for learning functional programming techniques. The core of the language is beautiful and pretty simple. Intermediate concepts like monads are more difficult because you can look at them in more than one way and they take some time to really understand. While learning those concepts it also becomes clear why other language designers have made different choices. And that is imo the best part of learning Haskell. After that learning mixed languages like F# and Scala is easy.",1218541156

All books are of great quality and great value.</i><p>The literature is one of the biggest reasons I got into Lisp/Scheme.

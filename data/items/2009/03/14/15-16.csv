It's fun (and flattering, I suppose) to see computability explained in a broader context.<p>It makes me wonder: what is the lambda-calculus equivalent of the busy beaver?  Number of normal-order steps before normalization (for a given program size)?  Are the LCBB numbers different for different evaluation orders?  What metric do you use for program size: depth?  Number of lambdas?",1237045666

So that makes you like ""TipJoy for offline world"" coz you'll not be dealing with real currency and only manage donations.<p>I can guess whats up next: an sms version, iphone app, android and so on.<p>Rock-n-rolla!!<p>All the best Eiso",1237045431
515893,comment,515876,515888,0,0,eisokant,,,"Hey Akash,<p>The way it works is that companies who are interested in donation money to a charity and getting visibility on Twitter can chose to sponsor a charity. So then if for example a 1000 Twollars are donated, the company sponsoring the charity will donate a $1000 Dollars.<p>Yup, I had launched it from a netbook in a hotel lobby/restaurant in London since I was traveling at the time and we really wanted to get it out there (someone posted a Twitpic of that). It was a great experience and got to meet up with some great people via Twitter. One guy even found a problem in the code and averted disaster.<p>All the best,<p>Eiso",1237045162

515888,comment,515876,515876,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Eiso,<p>Twollars is a cool idea. How do you bridge the thing? Real money vs Twollar money. I mean, do you actually donate money when someone donates money? or is it just a service where you allow others collect donations?<p>P.S: I've been noticing you've been using using Twollars a lot yourself. Did you launch it from a cafe? I think I saw a pic of you in a green shirt and a laptop :) I've been spying on Twollars for a while LOL :)",1237044805

And congratulations on landing the NY Times.<p>As someone else said before, now you have to get <a href=""http://jellyfishart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jellyfishart.com/</a> to be a top hit on Google for your name, and/or the concept of jellyfish tanks. Unfortunately the NYTimes didn't mention the domain name or the company name. (I wonder, can such things be negotiated?)<p>Link to the NYTimes story on the front page of your site. Maybe start a ""Links"" section; this is also useful for trading links with other entrepreneurs to build page rank.<p>Just curious, why no phone number? If I were you I'd put that in the footer of every page.<p>Funny, but I see very few pages at all on Google for your company. Maybe you should try Google's webmaster tools.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/dashboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/dashboard</a><p>Since you probably can't afford the services of an SEO consultant (and most of them do shady things anyway) perhaps the best thing is to find a lot of business directories and make an entry for your company, with links back to your website. Also your YouTube channel or any other avenues you can think of. Ideally this should have been in place before the article came out but you still have time if you work on sites that Google crawls quickly.<p>There are a few mistakes on the page which a browser will render ok but may cause Google to give up. Use <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://validator.w3.org/</a> and you'll see what I mean.<p>I'm guessing that you're using some kind of tool to create HTML - these tend to suck for getting Google rank, since the structure is visually pretty but hard for Google to understand. For instance, search engines can't determine what's a heading and what's not unless you use the standard <h1>...<h6> tags. Also, adding an alt=""something"" attribute to your images tells Google what is in the picture (and that's required for XHTML anyway, which you seem to be trying to support)",1237043150

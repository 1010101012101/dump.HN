508115,comment,507467,507942,0,0,IgorCarron,,,"As it turns out, convex optimization is being seen by a few folks as the new least square. As wwalker mentioned, convex optimization is currently being used in solving for measurements taken with hardware implementing compressive sensing (or compressed sensing or compressive sampling). The A/D converter is just one of the application of compressive sensing. One of the most well known example is that of the single pixel camera at rice but there are many others. I have listed most of the known hardware implementing compressive sensing here:<p><a href=""http://igorcarron.googlepages.com/compressedsensinghardware"" rel=""nofollow"">http://igorcarron.googlepages.com/compressedsensinghardware</a><p>One should note that while convex optimization has given some real impetus to the field (by providing theoretical bounds), signal reconstruction is also using speedier techniques nowadays even though linear programming techniques remains some sort of gold standard. For those of you interested in the subject, I write a small blog on the subject of CS:<p><a href=""http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/search/label/CS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/search/label/CS</a><p>and have written a page trying to summarize our current understanding in this page(it is a bit technical):<p><a href=""http://igorcarron.googlepages.com/cs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://igorcarron.googlepages.com/cs</a><p>Cheers,<p>Igor.",1236585578

The meta-noise reached its peak just before flagging was introduced, and it got way better after that. It still flares up intermittently, like now. An interesting observation is that it's mostly new(ish) users who post complaining meta-comments. Perhaps after they've been around for a while they notice that those discussions are always the same, as are the ""sky is falling"" threads.<p>Edit: uh-oh, the right margin is fast approaching. And damn it, I had managed to go at least 6 months without getting sucked in to this meta business!",1236585478

508105,comment,508033,508073,0,0,gruseom,,,"YMMV, but I've found that in interpersonal situations the kind of resourcefulness that pays off the most is actually internally directed. If I give closer attention to my own reactions, I start to see what I'm doing to create or maintain a problem. That gives me new choices I didn't have before. I can stop doing those things or I can add something new, whereas it's hard to directly change what others are doing.<p>I've often wondered why this (applying introspection to social matters) works. For one thing, if I'm experiencing a certain reaction, the other person is often experiencing something similar (or opposite, but opposite <i>is</i> similar). For another, human relationships are systemic, meaning if a shift occurs in one place (you), some corresponding shift often occurs in another (them), yielding an effect that would be hard to bring about directly.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that the kind of resourcefulness you use in technical matters <i>can</i> be applied to social ones, but you have to learn how those two fields differ. If you try to naively treat one like the other, people will resist you till the cows come home. But the underlying qualities, like curiosity and play and trying different things, bridge both areas.",1236584774

508101,comment,507948,508082,0,0,codinghorror,,,"> Not everyone agrees on what is interesting<p>The problem is that the upvoters get a <i>highly disproportionate</i> say in the matter. Let's say<p>- 30% of the HN community finds that drug war article interesting. They all upvote it.
- 20% don't care or have no opinion. They do nothing. 
- The other 50% think the article is only marginally on-topic. (I would say it is not at all on topic, but let's give the benefit of the doubt.)<p>For those HN users, the article isn't spam or evil or lame (it's the freakin' Economist!), so lumping it in with that sort of nastiness by flagging it seems extreme -- a bit like the nuclear option. I can't find any description of how the flagging works, so I don't know if flag counts are public or not.<p>What you end up with is a plurality of public upvoters balanced by a (I'm assuming) silent and mostly invisible minority of off-topic flaggers.

They don't really balance each other in the case of a marginally on-topic submission.<p>What would help, <i>particularly</i> in these marginal cases, is a reciprocal downvote.",1236584518

You seem somewhat of an autodidact, so did you find that the coursework was an acceptable study plan, or did you end up supplementing the coursework to learn the material?<p>The school you mentioned seems to be credible, it even has a couple engineering technology programs accredited by TAC of ABET. But I haven't had great experiences with getting college credit through standardized tests. I took several CLEP tests before entering college. And while it was definitely worth it to get rid of some general ed requirements, the tests were extremely easy. All I ended up doing was reading the study books once or twice before the tests.

Every day founders have to face the doubt inherent in what they are trying to accomplish.<p>But I think the hurdles are as much internal as they are external and the summary applies to both. Founders have to overcome the internal issues by being relentlessly resourceful as well as the external. ""Why am I doing this?"" is a question every founder is asking themselves daily because we are all sacrificing something to start our product.<p>Getting over the internal hurdles requires a great deal of resourcefulness merely to justify continuing the pursuit another day. ""Should I quit now? Have I done everything I can to make this work?"" ""I can't quit yet because I haven't tried X.""<p>You have to be resourceful to prove to yourself that you shouldn't quit just yet.<p>Relentless resourcefulness applies to internal factors as much as it does external factors because you have to be resourceful enough to provide yourself the impetus to continue, to keep sacrificing.

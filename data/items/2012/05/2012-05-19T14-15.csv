Still, the disposable lightbulb sells and sells, a testament to Edison's business mind.<p>Based on the number, and staggering impact of each of Tesla's inventions, I don't believe Edison could spell Tesla on his best day; especially where it camee to innovation and creating things that hadn't existed before, let alone imagined.<p>The main question about Edison vs Tesla is, why no one knows who Tesla is even though he was at least an equal to Edison, if not arguably more.<p>* There's some argument about this occurring but there are also media reports that exist.",1337439509

3996042,comment,3995574,3995925,1,0,zred,,,"I think I can shed light on what being a ""DSL for the web"" means.<p>1. PHP has built-in templating in that it's a language that gets embedded within other text files.  If you go with PHP, you don't have to decide how you're going to output your content into your front-end design.  So, PHP (as a language) has made the decision on templating much in the way that frameworks like Rails and Django make that decision for Ruby and Python.  And it's possible to override that decision in any of those frameworks and even PHP has alternative templating engines, but it provides a built-in default decision.<p>2. PHP puts many useful things into global variables.  One can debate the merits of this (and I'm not here to do that), but when you're new to things and can be told ""anything in that form will be available in $_REQUEST['var_name'],"" that can get you off the ground fast - much in the same way that params[:var_name] does in Rails.<p>3. PHP provides built-in ""routing"".  Heck, it's files on your filesystem.  You know how a static site works?  Great!  You know how PHP works (in terms of routing) as well.  I appreciate having reversible routers, but one can see how PHP's approach is simple, especially for new users who might have experience with static sites.<p>I could go on, but it would basically be re-stating the same concept.  PHP as a language includes many micro-framework features in the language itself and they're usually implemented in a simple way (even if one argues that it's not an ideal way for long-term maintainability).  It gets people off the ground running fast and because its micro-framework-like capabilities are widely used, it's easy to google for information.<p>I don't program in PHP much, but I can understand why it could be called a ""DSL for the web"".  It has many of the things that users grab a framework to handle built into the language.  I personally much prefer to work on a site in a framework in Python, Ruby, C#, or Java, but PHP's thin layer of framework tools built into the language is very easy to understand and fast to learn.",1337439377

Also, just having this step in the right direction will hopefully set up a time in the future when <i>all</i> dealings with the police have to be recorded by law.<p>A similar thing happened in my home town.  A state law said that all police cars must have cameras for DUI stops.  One of the counties in the state that wrote the most DUIs kept saying they couldn't afford to put cameras in all of the cruisers.  Finally, a judge started throwing out all DUIs where the camera wasn't installed.

Ironically, I'd suggest the advice be relied upon if one became wealthy.<p>On the one hand is the hubris of it all. Dejected over not being a billionaire? More so than money, what one needs in that context is perspective.<p>I have colleagues, friends and business partners who fall in the category of highly financially successful. Extreme wealth comes with more trouble than one might expect. Anonymity? Good luck with that. Jealousy from friends? A lot. Thrill quotient goes way, way WAY up? Like clockwork. Your personality changes? Big time. Still feel unfulfilled? Almost guaranteed. Biggie was right -- mo money, mo problems.<p>On the other hand is dealing with your goals, and whether or not you have attained them. If your goal is to acquire a billion dollars...well, shoot for higher ground (not higher dollars.) Financial happiness and comfort is one thing, but a specific number has more to do with ego. Money, as a goal, just doesn't equate to feelings of accomplishment. Instead, set your goals to non-financial things; it's the only way one can ever really satisfy those feelings of reward.<p>BTW, all those I've know who generated their own wealth did so without a primary focus of acquiring wealth -- it was a byproduct of their actions.

For example, there's no problem in saying all people are stupid, but saying all black people are stupid IS immoral, and doing actions based on that thought is also immoral. In that way, the ""plough the fields"" was a reference to black people being slaves and by selling Legos in that way, you are propagating the almost dead idea that black people should be slaves.<p>I was not referring to men and women being equal to the law, but being equal as humans.

(This is true for trait 1, trait 2, etc.)<p>Each individual trait in these groups overlaps quite drastically. Imagining that all the mass of the normal distribution is contained in a ball of radius 20, then for any single trait A lives on the ball of radius 20 about 0 (namely [-20,20]) while B lives on [-19, 21]. Barely different, right?<p>On the other hand, in the N-dimensional space, the point (0,0,...,0) has a distance sqrt(N) from the point (1,1,...,1). So in 401-dimensional space, the ball of radius 20 around (0,0,...,0) and the ball of radius 20 around (1,1,...,1) don't overlap at all and the discriminant f(traits)=sign(trait[1] + trait[2] + ... + trait[N]) works fantastically.<p>This is one reason why ""big data"" can work well - chaining together many weak predictors gets you a strong predictor.<p>See Lewontin's Fallacy for a biological example of this.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewontins_Fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewontins_Fallacy</a>",1337437171

Despite her later dogmatism, I respect her as a philosopher because she (a) opened my eyes to how absurd Hegel-derived philosophies are, and (b) made me understand the cult of Athena in the ancient Greece and the impact it likely to have had on Western civilization.

3995930,comment,3995615,3995775,16,0,tel,,,"One should also take a close look at the formulas for volumes of <i>unit-radius</i> n-balls. For even numbers of dimensions it's<p><pre><code>    pi^(n/2)/fact(n/2)
</code></pre>
which behaves very interestingly[1]. It's equal to pi in two dimensions, peaks at the 4-dimensional ball (about 1.6 pi), then is driven to effectively zero by the time you get to 20 dimensions or so (value of ~8/1000 pi).<p>Again, however, the radius isn't changing. I don't think of unit balls as being spiky--they're still rotationally invariant in all d rotational degrees of freedom, so calling them spiky doesn't sit well with me.<p>Instead, imagine you lived on a line, only walking up and back along it forever. Then, one day, someone introduced you to the plane and then a volume. These are vastly larger than the space you were afforded by the line: exponential blowup.<p>It's also driven home by how the Lesbegue measure in d-dimensions assigns zero measure to all (d-1)-dimensional (or lesser) objects. Adding a dimension just makes space immensely larger.<p>And so pegging the size of our unit ball to its 1-dimensional parameter, the radius, causes its volume to vanish.<p>[1] Wolfram Alpha chart showing the volume of the n-sphere in units of pi <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi%5E%28n%2F2-1%29%2FGamma%5Bn%2F2%2B1%5D+from+0+to+30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi%5E%28n%2F2-1%29%2FGa...</a>",1337436005

Not to say that the abstraction doesn&#x27;t exist, just that you&#x27;re a bit too far in the othering-realm for my tastes. There&#x27;s definitely a middle ground in there where the semantic difference between entrepreneur and architect doesn&#x27;t exist - where good work and good ideas &quot;are&quot;, regardless of how far you swing on that spectrum.  I agree that the distinction between the two types of individual is necessary, but an over-use of it is an easy way to lose out in the long run.<p>The question about what you did to stop a failing project is an odd one and probably completely ineffective. If that&#x27;s the reason they didn&#x27;t hire you, take it as a good thing. There&#x27;s too much nuance for it to be considered useful without other considerations. My recent situation was that I pushed too hard to stop a failing project and was socially cast out. By the time the senior staff noticed that my suggestions actually made sense and weren&#x27;t batshit extreme, the social dynamic was too much and I left.<p>On your last point, I&#x27;m not sure that would be a useful question, either. It&#x27;s so incredibly for a linux lead to say, &quot;Our infrastructure security has no technical debt&quot;, for example.  It&#x27;s easy to say, but impossible to prove without being at the company for a while, even for an in-the-mud admin.  Hell, that&#x27;s what happened at the place I just left.",1453186482

Google is not DDG, though. G+ would have needed a much larger share of the social networking market to be considered a win for Google, and the initial differentiation was not anywhere near clear enough to get there against a rival as strong as Facebook.<p>I also agree about the UI mess, and all that, of course, it was not a great product to use out of the gate.",1453186369

10929201,comment,10927312,10928348,0,0,orionblastar,,,"I worked a programming job for a law firm. I earned an associate&#x27;s degree because I could not afford a four year degree. I majored in data processing with the programming option. When I applied for the job only an associates was required and it was 1997. After the Dotcom bubble burst in 1999-2000 HR decided to rewrite job descriptions. So they had me rewrite the job description for my position. I wrote that it needed an associates, and experience in programming etc. HR took it and changed one thing, a bachelors instead of an associates. I suddenly was no longer qualified for the job I held.<p>I was forced to work extra hours for no extra pay because I was salaried. I was under a lot of stress and assigned other people&#x27;s projects until I was overwhelmed with them. I worked in St. Louis MO and my wife didn&#x27;t want me to relocate and be in a different state so my job search was limited and nobody was hiring.<p>From the stress I developed a mental illness in 2001 and became disabled on short term disability. When I returned from short term disability I was fired for having a panic attack at work. They lost my doctor&#x27;s notes that excused me and used them against me.<p>I tried another job in 2002 they used me to get their project to the next level, migrating from Excel to SQL Server for their database and optimizing the code. After the project was done, I was fired.<p>I ended up on disability in 2003, I went back to college to earn a bachelors but I was never medically cleared to go back to work.<p>I am 47 now, and I feel like my career is over. I had offers to work in the west coast but I could not relocate because of my wife not wanting me to leave out of state. I&#x27;m sure the working environment is different in SV and west coast companies.<p>But if other white men of a middle age had the stress that I had when working, I can see them developing a mental illness or turning to drug use. I never turned to drug use, but I had problems sleeping and waking up due to the stress.<p>I had friends who didn&#x27;t go to college but learned programming by experience, they were expert programmers but lost their jobs because they didn&#x27;t have college degrees and ended up working in retail jobs to make ends meet like Sam&#x27;s Club.<p>I&#x27;ve known people with college degrees that didn&#x27;t know what they were doing and I mentored them at work to get them started in programming. It is possible to earn a degree and still have problems doing the job they are hired for. For example programming classes teach how to write short programs that are very small, but writing larger more complex programs and how to debug them is not taught. That takes experience in the real world.",1453186256

I understand charging money for your software, but you can also charge for feature requests and support.

What has stuck with me the most in my research is, metrics should be used to gauge risk and quality and not performance.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s research division has published a bunch of academic papers on code churn related metrics like the following:<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=69126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=6912...</a><p>And if you do a quick google search, you&#x27;ll find others like:<p><a href=""http://web2-clone.research.att.com/export/sites/att_labs/techdocs/TD_100504.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web2-clone.research.att.com/export/sites/att_labs/tec...</a><p>However looking at what was posted, I&#x27;m not sure the product calculates code churn in same the way that I&#x27;ve learned it to be. My understanding of code churn and as it is used in academic research, describes code churn as the total number of lines added, changed and deleted between two points.  The ability to distinguish between line additions, changes and deletions are important.<p>For example, as you get closer to a release milestone, you would expect the churn to be line changes as opposed to adding or removing lines.  Adding/removing lines is an indication of restructuring, while line changes would be modifications to existing source.<p>There also does not appear to be any obvious way to drill into the churn data to see what files are creating the churn.  Maybe this is information is in the database, but being able to identify areas of churn is important.  Having churn in your documentation is definitely not as risky as having churn in your core code as you get closer to a certain milestone.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on better integrating my code churn technology with GitHub and I have some examples at<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/d4avE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/d4avE</a><p>which goes over how code churn metrics can be used to better understand repo changes.<p>Edit:<p>I didn&#x27;t realize the charts were interactive, but it does appear to recognize lines added, changed and deleted.  However it is not clear how the churn is calculated.  Not sure if it is a cumulative churn or if it is diff churn.",1453184821

Schools and churches form a ton of relationships due to their nature of bringing people together under a singular purpose and allowing for serendipitous connections to form.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be church that brings people together, and there are other communities that have church like qualities such as car clubs, user groups, etc.<p>What we do lack is a church-alternative meetup for the masses that forge a community together.  The closest we probably have is reddit.  Just before the technological age, communities were brought together for survival, but now that we really don&#x27;t even need each other for survival e.g. more efficient to hunt/build together, it seems that communities are decaying away.<p>I&#x27;ve found it interesting that in the immigrant communities, religion is a pretext for bringing a single ethnicity together for people to form relationships and business partnerships.  It does seem that religion has a certain staying power only if to purely provide community under the guise of spreading a &quot;good&quot; morals.",1453183383

See Shadi Hamid&#x27;s writings on the matter.  Essentially, the future of the Muslim Middle East is more illiberalism and more Islamism.<p>As you mentioned, currently the only democracy in the ME is Israel, though I have hope for a secular and democratic Kurdistan.  I&#x27;ve heard whispers that the main reason the US isn&#x27;t backing an independent Kurdistan separating from Iraq is the worry that the lack of the Kurds as a moderating force on Iraq will enable Iran to fully control the state (more so than it already does), essentially allowing it to become an Iranian client state.<p>Being neutral in the Sunni-Shi&#x27;a divide is functionally impossible for a number of reasons, but to easily understand why it&#x27;s impossible, just try to imagine what neutrality in that context would actually look like.  There&#x27;s no answer that all sides would agree is neutral.  The US has to be a part of it because the US has no choice - Americans benefit from the US dominated world order (as do most other people of the world).  When you&#x27;re a superpower with stakes in virtually every matter, even inaction is an action; even not choosing is a choice.<p>Enabling Iran hurts American interests.  Iran is a destabilizing force, rather than a status quo power.  Iran has  had, and continues to have a choice: is it a movement, or is it a respectable state?  It&#x27;s leaders have consistently chosen to be a movement, exporting its revolution wherever it can, and upending the region and the world according to its vision.  And let&#x27;s not forget, a part of that vision is the annihilation of America&#x27;s one reliable ally in the region, Israel, and the murder of all of its Jewish inhabitants.<p>We can only say that Iran acts rationally if we understand its motives.  Its leaders view power and geopolitics as a zero-sum game, and it cannot win as long as the US, Israel, and the Sunnis are not dominated by its Shi&#x27;a axis.",1453183304

It&#x27;s frustrating, because it <i>could have</i> been a great opportunity to thoughtfully integrate Google&#x27;s services.<p>G+&#x27;s phoneyness often manifested in overriding user preferences. E.g., unthinkably, Eric Schmidt thought it was a great vehicle to get people to start using their real names. Coupled with forced signups, butchered product integrations, destruction of Google Reader, awkward promotion by Black Eyed Peas, and Vic Gundotra constantly posting Youtube videos that were clearly meant to appeal to &quot;regular people&quot;, it has been painful to watch.<p>The public is not oblivious to motive, especially when it comes to choosing a social network. FB&#x27;s key to its early success was an air of Ivy League exclusivity. G+ had Google&#x27;s relatively sterling technical reputation, respect for privacy, and credence in the &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; motto, but squandered it to desperately imitate Apple and FB.",1453183258

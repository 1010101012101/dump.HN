He first noticed it as a sudden worsening of vision, followed by a breakdown of spatial relationships. My mom's boyfriend's best friend died of it too.<p>It's a horrible disease and the worst part about it is that it always comes back. Surgery and treatment might buy you 5 good years if you catch it early and it isn't as malignant. But it will always come back and kill you.<p>If anyone has any illusions that human personalities are made of more than the meat in our heads, watching someone die of a brain tumor will disabuse you of them. Bits of them disappear, and the remaining bits misfire and overcompensate for the bits that aren't there.<p>For anyone reading this, if your vision suddenly gets worse, don't just get new glasses. Go see a doctor. Most of our brain is devoted to visual processing, and if something isn't right it usually manifests there first.",1280879969
1573196,story,,,4,7,throwaway11,"Ask HN: We're going in circles, chasing shiny objects, now what?",,"I'm working for a start up in which we started over a year ago building something that everyone was very excited about.  From what we saw people wanted to use it, and were very excited about what it was going to bring.  We launched it a few months later, and got mild attention.  We stayed under the radar as we onboarded people, however it seemed like people would come, look around and leave.<p>Now we have over engineered as we tried to guess the market, with very little feedback.  We have gotten to the point at one part we uncommented a line of code and brought a 'new' feature back.  Basically we're now going in circles.<p>We admit the design of the product wasn't spectacular, however the very small feedback/interaction it would seem that the demand just isn't there, at least in the quantity we want it to be.<p>We listened to some potential customers and built their feature/product however after it was built few used it, despite it was what they said they wanted and worked as requested.<p>Now it seems we are just chasing after anything that seems to have a hope with the customers, and not keeping focus long enough.<p>We're at the crossroads where it feels like if we stay focused on our original focus, we might miss what we should adapt to after seeing the market more in depth.<p>Have you been in this situation?  Do you have suggestions?",1280879952

Imagine the number of people who leave bittorrent open in the background, stream porn, or whatever else that leaves their individual HTTP connections slow.  Hell, latency alone (it takes at least a second for my connection to reach the east coast of the USA) would have an effect, and you can't underestimate the increasing number of mobile devices on slow(-ish, depending on congestion) 3G networks.<p>I'd provide statistics from my server (I serve an NZ gaming community), but I suspect my numbers would be disproportionate compared to the average workload.  Here in NZ, we have far more people on crappy pipes (our DSL network is, famously, a gigantic pile of shit - although that has improved over the past couple of years and continues to), and far less people on smartphones (iPhones cost ~$800USD here).<p>Still, I believe the commenter has a point which you shouldn't ignore, or at least shouldn't pass off so easily :).

1573145,comment,1570694,1572321,0,0,jacquesm,,,"So, here are the numbers from one of the webservers that I instrumented to log the active-to-total ratio over a couple of hours.<p>The webserver is custom job called yawwws (yet-another-www-server) that is used to serve up a variety of bits and pieces for a high traffic website, typically the requests are very short in nature (a 500 byte request followed by a < 10K answer).<p>After about two hours of running the active-to-total ratio varied between 10% to 40% for 5 minute intervals, with the majority of the 5 minute buckets around the 30% mark. I'm actually quite surprised at the spread.<p>The bigger portion of the time seems to be spent waiting for the clients to send the request, most if not all of the output data should fit in the TCP output buffers, so that actually skews the results upwards, for longer running requests sending more data to the clients the active-to-total ratios would probably be a bit lower.<p>So 10% to 40% of all the sockets were active at any given time, the rest was idle, waiting for data to be received or for buffer space to be freed up so data could be written.<p>In this situation epoll would be faster than poll because epoll only sends the user process those fds that it actually has to deal with rather than all of them, so the loop that takes the output of the system call will have less iterations.<p>So, as I wrote before, I think the typical web server is, when it is dealing with the client facing side more often than not waiting for the client to do something, and it seems that on my server that hasn't changed since I last looked at it.<p>This server runs with keepalive off. Switching it on will most likely make the active-to-total ratio dramatically lower but I don't feel like pissing off a large number of users just to see how bad it could get. There is a good chance that my socket pool will turn out to be too small to do this without damage.<p>Chances are that for different workloads the percentages will vary but this setup is fairly typical (single threaded server, all requests served from memory) so I wouldn't expect to see too much variation on different sites, and if there is variation I'd expect it to go down rather than up.<p>If I get a chance I'll re-run the test on some other websites to see if the numbers come out comparable or are wildly different.",1280878745

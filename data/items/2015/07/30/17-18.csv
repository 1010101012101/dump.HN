AND THAT&#x27;S OK. Use something else.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that if you are an admin or just operate your own AD installation you can store the key in Active Directory.

Whether it makes more sense to defer to a specialist or invest in bringing a skill &quot;in-house&quot; is a function of how expensive the specialist is, how much investment it takes to gain the skill, and the duration and frequency of that skill&#x27;s usefulness. Being able to fish (or farm, etc.) to the degree that you can feed yourself has enormous upfront costs (a boat, farming equipment, education, etc.) relative to the cost of outsourcing it. Managing your personal finances is quite a cheap skill – it requires no specialized equipment, and only up-front self-education and ongoing self-control costs – relative to the cost of paying someone else to do it for you.<p>I&#x27;m speaking in absolutes, but of course it varies person to person, and I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that I think there&#x27;s no place for this sort of service, only that I think it seems expensive relative to the effort required to gain what is an extremely valuable skill.

What looks chaotic to you may just be something that grew up organically over time and has an internal logic that isn&#x27;t readily apparent.  If they have money to pay you, they must be doing something right.  Consider seeking that expertise out, even if you feel you are not necessarily being challenged at the technology level.  You can always change jobs later when you have this experience under your belt.  First jobs out of college are supposed to be &quot;stepping stone&quot; jobs anyway.  &quot;Get what you can and move on&quot; is an entirely legitimate way to approach this.<p>Think about where you want to end up eventually.  If you want to move into corporate-land writing reports against business databases, go for the .Net shop.  If you want to eventually do &quot;fun&quot; stuff in startup-land, then stay where you are.  Because the reality is the complexity of what people are doing with .Net is relatively low - they use it to run businesses, so you&#x27;re always writing a variant of a shopping cart or accounting program.  When people want to do something interesting/new/really challenging, they tend to choose other tools than those provided by Microsoft, inclusive of .Net.<p>So I guess if you want immediate security, go with the .Net shop.

A quarter million\n  came from the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), a\n  CIA spinoff that now operates under the Broadcasting Board\n  of Governors. IBB runs Voice of America and Radio Marti, a\n  propaganda outfit aimed at subverting Cuba’s communist\n  regime. The CIA supposedly cut IBB financing in the 1970s\n  after its ties to Cold War propaganda arms like Radio Free\n  Europe were exposed.\n\n  The second chunk of cash — just under $100,000 — came\n  from Internews, an NGO aimed at funding and training\n  dissident and activists abroad.

Some suggestions from my personal experience using Strava:<p>* Most runs are training runs so they carry their purposes instead of full-effort race simulation therefore predications based on training runs are usually a bit off.<p>* Having said that, Strava supports tagging runs which are races; not sure if the API can expose the tags but it would be useful to do a past race based prediction.<p>* Other than race time predictions, another area of interest is to evaluate training quality. A Chrome plugin, StravistiX does some of it but I&#x27;d like to see more such as using VDOT based on Jack Daniels&#x27; running formula which have their meanings in training.",1438278003

If you simply divide the numbers by 16 and take the remainder, you&#x27;ll find that the numbers 0–3 occur about 17% more often than others. This is because 16 does not evenly divide 100: the largest multiple of 16 less than or equal to 100 is 6×16 = 96, and it is the numbers in the incomplete range 96–99 that cause the bias. The simplest way to fix the problem is to discard those numbers before taking the remainder and to keep trying again until a number in the suitable range comes up.

9976449,comment,9973305,9974145,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I agree that calling it a disability is not right.  It&#x27;s a difference, it might make certain things more challenging, but a disability carries tones of uselessness.<p>The thing is I also don&#x27;t think it can be thought of as a trade-off.  There&#x27;s no great balancing factor. I see people who expect every autistic person to be some kind of savant like the Rain Man.  You don&#x27;t automatically get some bonus somewhere else to cancel out the issues you have.<p>What you do get is a different perspective.  You have to learn to cope, and in learning to cope, you learn to do things differently than anyone else might have had to.   It&#x27;s not because nature has somehow compensated you for what it took away, but because you simply had a different experience which forced you to learn differently.<p>I&#x27;ve got a different issue than dyslexia.  I&#x27;ve got an attention deficit issue.  There&#x27;s nothing really &#x27;good&#x27; about it, but there&#x27;s a few things about it.  One is that in learning to cope with it I&#x27;ve become very aware of my emotional state, about my motivation and stress, and how they impact my ability to focus.  I&#x27;ve kind of come to an understanding that&#x27;s hard to describe of &#x27;why&#x27; this happens to me (in short, I run through my ability to focus very quickly, and it recovers relatively slowly, so I can focus very intensely for long while, but doing so might make me useless for a week.  I&#x27;m normally living in a deficit because day to day it&#x27;s hard for me to avoid spending more focus than I recover).<p>In that I&#x27;ve learned a little about how I function, how and why other people act certain ways, how to have a ton of patience and why it&#x27;s really important to have downtime (for everyone, but especially for me), how to offload decision-making tasks.<p>And despite all of that, I still have the same challenges.  I mean, I don&#x27;t have full control over how much stress I&#x27;ll encounter or how much I&#x27;ll end up focusing and making decisions in a day.  I can try to do things to limit them, but that still happens regardless.<p>But I gained a perspective that other people don&#x27;t have, and I care about things that other people prefer to just joke about.  I just happen to see things in a different way than the majority and it&#x27;s important, but it&#x27;s not a tradeoff, it&#x27;s a consequence of this difficulty, and the fact that I&#x27;m not willing to just say &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m disabled, I&#x27;m not responsible for myself.&quot;  It&#x27;s more like, &quot;Yeah, I have this challenge, I&#x27;ve done this to overcome it.  I still have problems doing these things, so I try to avoid having to do those things.&quot;<p>Other people could totally learn the same things that I have, but they just haven&#x27;t been put in the position to be required to do self-reflection to get through the day.<p>Similarly, the things you learned because you were dyslexic might be things that other people could totally learn to do, the difference is you&#x27;ve ended up having to do them to get by.<p>It&#x27;s like two kids growing up, one kid is forced to carry 30 lb weights as he walks to school.  The other kid can get to school however he wants.  The result of the kid who carries weights is that he will get stronger.  But it&#x27;s hardly a tradeoff, he&#x27;s in a situation where he&#x27;s forced to carry those weights whether he wants to or not, he&#x27;s not getting anything in return, except the consequences of carrying those weights.<p>The kid who can ride the bus to school could carry weights instead, however, it&#x27;s highly unlikely anyone would choose to put themselves through that much difficulty when they could avoid it.  So you&#x27;d probably end up being stronger than him, but on the other hand, he could go to the gym and train and rest properly, while you&#x27;re forced to carry those weights whether you want to or not.<p>I&#x27;m just saying there isn&#x27;t some balance.  But we&#x27;re just forced to cope with things that other people don&#x27;t have to.  This gives us a unique perspective, but not necessarily an exclusive or even balancing factor.<p>Dyslexia on it&#x27;s own doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to do those things.  However, it pressures you to learn those things in order to cope with the fact that you can&#x27;t do it the easy way.  There&#x27;s no unique ability about Dyslexia itself that you could really capitalize on in that respect, but there are things you have definitely learned to do that you can capitalize on because of Dyslexia.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should worry about trade offs.  I think we should learn about what people can and can&#x27;t do and why that&#x27;s important.  I agree, if the kid can&#x27;t spell, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if they can make themselves understood.<p>However, our pedagogical system is such that we want to offer one curriculum for many people. Writing happens to be a big part of that, and it&#x27;s hard to measure aptitude when you&#x27;re struggling to write. We also really love testing, and spelling errors are a really easy thing to grade.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter what we should have, certain issues are going to continue to stand out until we fundamentally change how we teach.  And I don&#x27;t mean relax our standards, I mean each child would have to be taught to their own capacity individually, and that&#x27;s currently unreasonable.",1438276849

That would mean they would have to show intent, and while I&#x27;m not familiar with these particular journalists, I think it&#x27;s highly unlikely they are trying to destroy their own country, and are rather trying to perform their function as journalists in that they are informing citizens, aka the public, about potentially relevant information even if it may be considered confidential or secret in nature.<p>The problem is that the governments of the world want to pretend like that have final say in what constitutes <i>egregiously dangerous information</i> and often conflate it with information that is obviously not.<p>Germany has quite a few more restrictions on free speech as well, but I&#x27;m curious what section of law the accusations would fall under.<p>Look, the bottom line is that across the world, freedom of speech is dangerous to the powers that be, and it is communication that enables freedom of speech. Communication in the form of technology has largely leveled the playing field faster than nation states could catch up, and the internet has for a short time become a bastion of free speech in a world were the state and corporations have taken over almost all other forms (first it was the printing press, then the telegraph, then radio, and TV).<p>Now TPTB have awoken to the danger that is the internet as a medium of unrestricted anarchistic freedom of though, and that, my friends, is the real reason the internet will be, and is being, taken over, legislated, regulated, censored, tracked and tagged. Not because of &quot;national security&quot;, but because of &quot;globalized aristocratic oligarchical security posing as national security&quot;.<p>Make no mistake, they will pass the laws they want if they don&#x27;t exist, and if we fight them (like we did with SOPA/CISPA, etc) they will simply try again after learning the lessons of their defeat. That doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t keep fighting them, but the attacker, especially a well geared and learned attacker always has the advantage.<p>A good example of this kind of legislative subterfuge, at least in the US, is the Aldrich plan and the Federal Reserve Act.<p>According to G. Edward Griffin, Paul Warburg and his co-conspirators “added several very sound provisions to the Federal Reserve Bill. By that I mean they added some provisions which seriously restricted the ability of the Federal Reserve to create money out of nothing. Warburg&#x27;s associates said, ‘Paul, what are you doing? We don&#x27;t want those in there, this is our bill.’ And his response was, &quot;Relax fellas, don&#x27;t you get it? Our object is to get the bill passed. We can fix it up later.&quot; Those were his exact words. ‘We can fix it up later.’ …",1438276751

The amendment to subsection 108(a)(3) is intended to ease the burden on libraries and archives of the current law&#x27;s requirement that a notice of copyright be included on copies that are reproduced under section 108. Under this amendment, such notice would be required only where the particular copy that is reproduced by the library or archive itself bears a notice. The amendment to subsection 108(b) permits a library or archive to make up to three copies or phonorecords, rather than just one, for purposes of preservation and security or for deposit for research use in another library or archives, and permits such copies or phonorecords to be made in digital as well as analog formats.

9976337,comment,9970844,9975999,0,0,vonmoltke,,,"> Coding is a skill largely separate from other critical dev skills, e.g. design.<p>I do not believe coding is largely separate from engineering.  There are, of course, other skills that are necessary or desirable.<p>>  Someone can legitimately have deep knowledge of, e.g., how to build a 3-tier service architecture without actually being able to code. This isn&#x27;t &quot;faking it&quot;. It&#x27;s a different skill.<p>Absolutely.  It is also a level of skill I would only expect or look for in a position that was not going to be doing daily coding, such as a systems engineer.<p>> You can ... learn about the latest and greatest frameworks for writing web pages and APIs without ever writing a single line of code.<p>Here I disagree.  If you have never used a framework or API, you don&#x27;t know it.  I don&#x27;t care that you can regurgitate the Javadocs; I care that you know things like its pitfalls, quirks, and runtime oddities.<p>> There&#x27;s actually a decent chance that you&#x27;ll end up probing for trivia which is not a very useful filter.<p>To be clear, I <i>abhor</i> trivia-based interviewing.  What I am talking about is practical engineering tradeoffs between one course of action versus another, preferably supported by direct personal experience in the past.<p>> Even if you could probe deeply enough in conversation to expose that they can&#x27;t code, you could do the same with a few minutes of actual coding. When someone can&#x27;t code, it becomes clear pretty quickly when you ask them to code.<p>Exposing the level of competence a five-minute coding problem can is trivial to do in parallel with a deep engineering discussion.  In fact, I think some sort of code should be part of that discussion.  I just don&#x27;t think it should be the &quot;implement this&quot; CLRS problem.  It should be something two-way, more representative of what the job is like on a daily basis.",1438275784

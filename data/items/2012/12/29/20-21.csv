Because he was evil"" is BS.</i><p>Yeah, here we go with the strawmen again. I never said ""someone did X because they were evil"". I said they were evil, implying what they did is evil in my books. But then you wouldn't have anything to whine about, would you.<p><i>In it Hannah Arendt describes how what we perceive as ""the great evils in history"" like the Holocaust, were not executed by ""evil"" people (fanatics, etc), but by ordinary folks who ""accepted the premises of their state and therefore participated with the view that their actions were normal"".</i><p>What makes you think that not questioning enough isn't already enough to be considered <i>evil by me</i>? Someone asked ME if I consider Mao evil, I said yes. Which wasn't even to say ""as opposed to me or anybody else"".<p>Oh, and I saw videos of the Eichmann process and I saw no love in that man, no awareness, no nothing. And to me lack of love is already evil enough. Someone who mindlessly, coldly carries out orders is evil in my opinion, yes; that is, they are to be fought and not remembered once overcome.

The point of defining evil is so that you can teach people not to be evil.  Humans may not have a ""conscience"" that comes from God, but our brains have evolved for a sense of conscience that can be cultivated via the social pressure of parents, family, friends, teachers, and leaders.  The point of calling a person evil is to tell people, ""Do not be like this person! This person was evil!  If you are acting like this person act, you are a bad human being, and you should feel very bad about yourself and stop immediately.""<p>In the case of the rise of Hitler, yes, there were events that led to his rise.  But the rise of Hitler was not inevitable.  Had Hitler been raised with a stronger, better moral compass, had the people who enabled his rise possessed a better moral compass, the war and the Holocaust would not have happened.  After the war, the American occupiers rebuilt the education system to teach people that what Hitler did is evil, in order to install a moral compass that would prevent a repeat of the Holocaust from happening again. The Holocaust was not a tragic accident, it was not a necessary proportional response needed to prevent some other acts of suffering, the Holocaust was an act of evil.  It should be labeled as such so that people's consciences will work to prevent it from happening again.",1356813828

The whole nature of these social platforms seems to be entirely ephemeral - they spread by word of mouth because others are using it. The problem comes in when you consider that a person isn't going to use more than 2 or 3 of these platforms. So as soon as a new platform is released, older platforms are guaranteed to lose users even if the new platform is worse, as it will take a number of weeks or months for a typical user to understand and then reject the new platform. During that time, the older platform isn't being used.<p>This exact issue seems to apply to online gaming as well, so this isn't some new discovery of human behavior. There are some 'big' games (warcraft, cod) that retain their users even after a decade - but they do this by reinventing themselves and recreating their products constantly. I think social media and gaming are similar enough for a lot of these behavior traits to apply to social media also - which means the correct approach is to redesign/improve core parts of your social platform at least once a year to keep it relevant.",1356812999

The limited visibility makes this harder than understanding other aspects of software.  You can run instrumented simulations like cachegrind; you can query arcane CPU performance counters (Intel's Nehalem optimization guide was eye-opening regarding how much goes on inside vs. what you might learn in an undergrad CPU design class) -- but at the end of the day you have to be guided by experimentation and measurement.  And so many times those leave us with no good theories to explain the observed behavior.<p>(War story, feel free to skip:  One time we were trying to speed up a datafile parser by any means possible -- which was already split into a producer-consumer thread pair, one thread running the unfortunately complex grammar and producing a stream of mutation commands, the other thread consuming that and building up in-memory state.  The engineer working on this found that adding NOPs could speed this up, and he measured and charted a range of # of NOPs and chose the best one.  Our best guess was ""something to do with memory layout?""  The outcome of the story was that we tore out a bunch of abstraction layers and ended up with a simpler, single-threaded parser that didn't need such heroic and bizarre efforts, but it also left us feeling a bit of vertigo with regard to memory hierarchy behavior.)<p>Your pointing out that the shared memory abstraction is backed by message-passing between hardware components (which each represent concurrent processes) is really interesting - thanks!",1356812696

There are no up front deposits - honestly, it goes against my own values, I'm uncomfortable getting paid for work I have yet to do.  The terms are clear in the contracts with work stoppage clauses and all.  It's worked well going on about 6 months of doing this.

I trade though, and I also compose, so this project got my attention. What I'd like to add is this: My focus on trade in this period is penny stocks. From my own experiences and what others say, I can say Apple and other blue chips usually don't move as ""dramatically"" as much cheaper penny stocks. It's in the math. If a current price is in the $500 range, like Apple, changes of a few $s only represent less than 1%, whereas in penny or sub- penny stocks, a single trade can move the price up or down a few pennies or less that can easily amount to 10, 30 or bigger % change. Movements like that going back and forth within very short period sometimes resemble needle-sharp alien teeth, it's funny to watch. Price % changes are that much crazier, and likewise the volumes when a stock suddenly gets attentions etc. I'd imagine that music generated off that kind of data can present different kinds of compositional experiences.",1356811809

In agrarian times, 0.1% per year was typical. By the 1700s, we were up to 0.3-0.5% per year. By 1825, 1% per year was typical. Now, global economic growth is about 4% per year.<p><i>If we started out with a GDP 1% a year in 1950, and say GDP advanced .5% per year after that, we'd currently be experiencing 31% economic growth per year.</i><p>It won't grow that fast.

During the games the players do things we want to track.  And each game belongs to a season.  When you need to know more than that, we'll tell you more.</i><p>Was it gender biased?  I don't think so.  I never saw that detailed sports knowledge was a significant advantage.  Furthermore in my time interviewing at that company, we had a total of 2 women in that interview.  Neither had trouble on understanding the problem domain sufficiently well for modeling purposes.  We hired one of them.  We were on the fence about the other and decided not to.

The first was learning you could only have one block argument.<p>Do they resemble first-class objects at all?  Can you assign a variable to a block?  If you were to assign<p><pre><code>  { |i| x += i }
</code></pre>
to a variable outside that enclosing scope, and then used that variable in that scope, would i be overwritten in that call to the block?",1207658883

Python wouldn't have been my language of choice but it's a logical choice for Google.<p>I giggle at the fact that your users will end up creating Google accounts. Very smart on their part, but feels more than slightly underhanded :). Then again, maybe I'm just bitter since I got waitlisted, ha!",1207658874

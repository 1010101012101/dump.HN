While aerobic activities such as running, biking, and swimming are great for burning calories, your metabolism drops back to its pre-exercise state after your heart rate goes returns to normal. Anyone serious about staying in shape should include anaerobic exercise, specifically weightlifting, three times or more per week because it increases your metabolism for 48-72 hours after you conclude your workout.",1223927999

331372,comment,331212,331212,0,0,rcoder,,,"Before anyone gets too fired up about this, there are two major limitations:<p>1. Python code will only be executed from trusted sources (i.e., chrome loaded from the local filesystem). This means that you'll need to get users to download and install an extension to use your Python script code, rather than simply including it inline in a page on your server.<p>2. Because the extension bundles its own Python runtime, it has to be built and packaged separately for every architecture target. Right now, that means no 64-bit platforms, BSD, etc. -- so cross-platform compatibility is probably no better than Flash at the moment.<p>That being said, having yet another development language on the client for rich web applications is pretty cool. I can imagine all kinds of useful projects that could capitalize on Python's strong libraries. Hooking into native libraries using Python (either via the extension API or ctypes) is also a lot easier than writing an XPCOM wrapper.",1223924412

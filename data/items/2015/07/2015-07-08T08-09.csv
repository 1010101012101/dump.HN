It comes a bit late now, because most banks have already recovered their investments, and only the governments will be affected (and the IMF, ...)<p>Regarding pumping money: the now defenestrated Varoufakis has argued that Greece was not requesting money from the EU, but that the EU should have an investment program (much bigger than the ones currently in place), financed basically with Eurobonds, and implement by funneling those funds into both the private and public economy via banks. The program was intended to invest in poor European regions. The involvement of banks will use the profit motive to make sure that the investments are sound, and the fact that the funds will be nearly free (for the banks) will incentive the banks to really invest the money.<p>Not only Greece would benefit, but Lithuania too. And not all regions on those countries, only the ones in need.",1436345973

Each individual photon has just one direction. But photons are not like regular objects, if you send polarized light through a polarizer that is tilted 45 degrees relative to them you don&#x27;t block the light entirely like you would expect, instead half the light gets through. I guess you could interpret this as each photon having a 50/50 chance of making it though.<p>> The amplitude of a light wave doesn&#x27;t literally mean something is oscillating up and down, right??<p>Yes, it does mean that. The &quot;something&quot; is an electric and magnetic field. Does that count as a something?<p>Remember that a moving electric field induces magnetism, and a moving magnet induces an electric field. So the two fields essentially induce each other, that&#x27;s why light can never stop moving, or even change speed - the fields would no longer induce anything.<p>> The amplitude is just the light&#x27;s intensity.<p>No. The amplitude never changes.

(Linus harps on this one a lot.)<p>- So that there can be multiple competing libc&#x27;s. Linux is used in a lot of diverse environments, and the tradeoffs made by glibc (in terms of bloat, license, etc.) are not necessarily the best for everyone. Android does not use glibc, for example.<p>- So that you can isolate apps from each other using containers (hermetic chroot environments), where different containers may have entirely different libc. Docker (and my own Sandstorm.io) relies very heavily on Linux&#x27;s syscall ABI compatibility promises.<p>- Because the syscall ABI is frankly a much clearer boundary than the libc ABI, and arguably easier to keep backwards-compatible.

In my experience it does increase the intensity of dreams which could be a negative side effect if you are prone to nightmares.

Meet Portugal (my country). Some may know us derisively as the P in PIGS because of our financial problems (much similar to the Greek one in nature and extent).<p>In 2010 and 2011 as one of the 14 member states of the EU that were part of the Greek loan facility Portugal contributed with 1102 million euros into the 52.9 billion loan that greece received [1].<p>Yes, that&#x27;s correct, not all of the debt that people are so eager to expect that German forgives is from their coffers, it was actually pooled from the following countries: Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Spain.<p>2. As you may know, about the same time we had our own problems and also had to be bailed out. As part of the measures put in place to reduce our deficit a massive tax hike was implemented in the end of 2012 [2]<p>I&#x27;ll draw attention to single one of those measures: the 3.5% extraordinary tax on the income paid by every single person with income above minimum wage (485€/month) including pensioners.<p>Now, for the money quote [3]: &quot;Minister of Finance Vitor Gaspar said the tax would bring in 1025 million euros&quot;.
Less than what Portugal contributed to the Greek bailout fund. 3.5% of the income of every citizen in this country.<p>In conclusion, that&#x27;s one of the reasons for the nationalistic outrage against Greece defaulting the loan. It is not only the money of the richest bankers of Europe that won&#x27;t be repaid, it is the taxpayer money of each of those countries that contributed to their rescue.<p>To put in perspective, 1102 million euros means that default would cost every inhabitant in this country 110 euros (about 330€ per household) and not only hypothetically but in practice too as demonstrated above.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rekenkamer.nl/english/Publications/Topics/EU_governance_to_combat_the_economic_and_financial_crisis/Financial_stability_instruments/Financial_instruments/Greek_loan_facility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rekenkamer.nl/english/Publications/Topics/EU_gove...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/31/business/portugal-fiscal-tax-increase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/31/business/portugal-fiscal-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/other/governments-first-bill-taxes-christmas-allowance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/article...</a><p>P.S.

9850404,comment,9849042,9849042,0,0,bopf,,,"I have hired hundreds of people throughout my career - both for startups hiring employee number 2 and also for big corporates. Also, I am normally hiring in Europe. Some of the stuff I mention below may be totally illegal in the U.S.<p>The questions you ask differ a bit depending on where you are in the company life cycle.
As you mentioned interviewing for start ups above, let&#x27;s focus on that.
When hiring employee number 2 to 10 I tend to focus on personality and cultural fit. Instead of the typical job interview, I tend to take long lunches, dinners and walks with the people to find out if we would get along. After all, in a startup you tend to spend more time with your co-workers than with your spouse. So hiring at this stage is more like dating. Of course I ask about their past but some common questions I am interest in are:<p>- why do you want to join a startup? What is your main goal? This is to find out if they have hopes for lots of stock options and to make it big or if they have been frustrated in their old job for not being able to make decisions. Money focus usually is fine but they need at least one more key motivation as most startups will hit a rough patch where money becomes tight. If they join because they want to have big influence, only hire them if you are willing to give up control.<p>- are you willing to work very long hours and give up weekends if needed? How does your family life fit into this and how will you make sure that your family life does not suffer and in return impact your work performance.<p>- I tend to throw in a random question to test their problem solving skills like &quot;how many bakeries are in New York&quot;. Even though I find these kind of questions pretty common, they throw of most people. If they answer too fast, you know they have faced this kind of question before and you can ignore the answer. If they stall and look at you like you are crazy, then the answer is important. I tend to give them one or two hints and then just watch how they attempt to solve the problem.<p>- lastly, depending on the role I hire for, I give them some real life examples and ask them to provide answers. For a coder this will be a coding test for a sales guy I will describe a difficult sales situation etc.<p>hope this helps :)",1436343367

The vast majority of pedophiles are likely sad and lonely people condemned by a freak of nature to live with the burden of a sexual preference that in Western society carries the ultimate stigma.<p>Even discussing pedophilia calmly and reasonably opens one to the charge of being a pedophile or a &quot;pedophile apologist.&quot; Taboos can reveal a lot about a society but I&#x27;ll leave that discussion for another time.<p>I don&#x27;t completely trust the motives of guys like the author of the linked article. Others have already pointed out technical errors in the article and questioned the soundness of his methodology. His irrationally labeling Tor as &quot;the devil&quot; is a bit odd too (and highly illogical), to say the least. He even admits he has an irrational hate-on for pedophiles.<p>What is this guy actually achieving with his &quot;honeypot&quot; other than wrestling with his own demons (more on this later)? He set out to entrap ostensible pedophiles and gather their IP addresses etc. Not child abusers or child pornographers but people that clicked on his link offering a &quot;community of like minded individuals.&quot; He explains in detail the technical aspects of his operation and what he learned about the people he interacted with and draws some very dubious conclusions. (Such as &quot;Many visitors to the site were active pedophile predators.&quot; Maybe this is the case, but he offers no compelling evidence other than a few lines of a chat room transcript. Not once does he mention even contemplating contacting the FBI or his local PD or any other LEA. Rather, this seems to be mostly about him.<p>There have been a few high-profile cases over the years where crusaders dedicated to fighting things they found morally reprehensible (e.g. prostitution, narcotics, pornography, homosexuality, child pornography) were outed as being voracious consumers and/or practitioners of that which they vehemently opposed in public at every opportunity. One of them was a DA who made a name for himself with his aggressive prosecution of alleged prostitutes and child pornographers. There is a term for this in psychology which I can&#x27;t recall at the moment. Basically, there are some people who deal with the cognitive dissonance and the associated shame and guilt of being attracted to something society or their religion condemns morally by venting against it publicly while indulging in it privately. A guy who has an anti-porn website, say, and publishes anti-porn literature for distribution in schools who travels the country speaking out against porn and attending and organizing anti-porn conferences while fapping himself raw to internet porn every night after work.<p>I am *not saying I think the guy in the article is a pedophile or harms children. I am saying that I don&#x27;t think his prime motive for doing this project is empathy or compassion for victims of child abusers and predators. He sets up a &quot;honeypot&quot; that serves no practical purpose. No suspected child abusers were investigated, no children saved from harm, police and LE don&#x27;t even get a mention. Nothing new and useful was brought the table.<p>Yet based on his two-week escapade &quot;Tor is the devil.&quot; That seems like a very odd statement, especially coming from an engineer. Is his computer the devil&#x27;s sidekick? He does admit that he is motivated by personal reasons and it very much shows. After reading his piece I don&#x27;t know what the take away is supposed to be. Pedophiles use the internet? Tor is used for illegal activities? Anyway, it&#x27;s late and this is going in circles. I mean no disrespect to the author but I am left feeling very puzzled.",1436342590

Two examples in regards to the 10% brain thing:<p>Someone: ""You know, you only use 10% of your brain!""<p>You: ""Actually, that has been debunked forever now. If you had just searched on Google you'd have known this. It's totally false, you use your entire brain yada yada yada.""<p>vs.<p>You: ""Yeah, someone I know told me that before and I thought it sounded really weird, so I googled around and found out that it turns out it's not actually entirely true! Pretty crazy, eh? It turns out, you use your entire brain yada yada""<p>The former is ""you are dumb, if you used the internet or was as smart as me you'd know better"" The latter is ""hey friend, let me tell you a story about how I found out about how that's not true.

613771,comment,613491,613491,0,0,ilitirit,,,"FWIW, after reading the 40 or so comments posted so far, here are some of my thoughts, observations and things I've learned after submitting the original post (in no particular order):<p>1.  Either there are very few people on HN who can relate to this ""problem"" (when I put something in quotes, it sometimes means I am doing so for the sake of brevity  ie. I understand the implications and various connotations of a term but explaining that I do would take up to much time/space.  Like now.), or they felt more compelled to comment on aspects of my post than post their own experiences.  Both of these explanations echo what I've observed in the real world and on other sites<p>2.  Intelligence is a very touch subject for many people.  Many people chose to comment on my choice of using the phrase ""dumbing down"".  I'm still trying to find a good choice of words that doesn't need to fill entire paragraph, and that can adequately express what I mean.  I think the audience here plays a big role is choosing the correct phrasing.<p>3.  I should spend more time thinking about the examples I cite.  A few people based parts of their comments around the fact that I mentioned ""strip club"" (apparently sex still sells).  I don't enjoy strip clubs at all.  I mentioned it because a) it's true, b) I thought it would provide a good contrast.  \nBut more importantly, instead of spending time agonizing over examples (I spent quite a bit of time considering whether or not I should use the ""10% of our brain"" bit), perhaps I should try to express more clearly that I'm talking about <i>patterns of behaviour</i>, rather than individual occurrences.<p>4.  I'm under no illusions - it's very, very difficult if not impossible to generalize human behaviour.  People are different and they can interpret things in very different ways.  Culture also plays a very big role.  That's why I don't really expect to find the answer here or anywhere else.  (Maybe there isn't an answer?  Maybe this is a non-problem?)  I just tend to look for patterns in responses and try to improve/change my own attitude, mindset, communication and relationships with people (if I do find great advice, it's a bonus).  Most of the replies I've read have misinterpreted something I've said.  That could be partly my fault and/or partly the reader's.<p>5.  One can't really quantify aspects of social relationships objectively, so you resort to using qualifiers like ""tend to"", ""many"" (instead of ""any""), and ""probably"" etc, rather than talking about ""10% of the time"", or ""60% of my discussions"".  But considering that most people seemed to ignore these qualifiers, is this really the best way to express these ideas?<p>6.  Believe it or not, I get along with people very well.  I know about adapting to different situations and can do it with great ease, and I do recognize what I'm talking about as my own shortcoming rather than blaming others.<p>There are many other things but I think these are the most significant for now.",1242586526

Also, I don't think it's generally true.<p>Certainly, a large part of our identity is socially created. Yet, at the same time, there is a pretty large kernel that's there whether or not we're in our usual social circles, whether or not we change our career, location, etc. And, for some, that kernel is more important than the socially-dependent aspects.<p>I'd add that some parts of that kernel override whatever environment we're in.

It's already a process that runs 'many minutes' and you check back on later. So the delay is already mitigated, and the benefit less than the raw speedup would suggest. (And if lightning-fast builds were project-critical, even after this fix you'd switch to native zip.)<p>Still, I'm glad this is fixed and wouldn't mind if Sun or other big Java vendors had a few interns/students just roaming legacy code looking for cheap wins like this.",1242586251
613765,comment,613491,613491,0,0,c00p3r,,,"There are several kinds of human-human relations in which dumbing yourself down are good thing. For example, in employee-employer relationship employee usually act dumber than his boss. Many women 'playing dumb' when it seems useful for them, especially when a man pays, and most of sales people doing this all the time.<p>But in some situations, you will probably hate it and will have an urge to be yourself - not act or adapt at all, and not see other people's acting.

613764,comment,613628,613693,0,0,coffeemug,,,"That's the beauty of the whole thing. I've seen grown men who appear to be perfectly happy break down and cry like children after only three days of meditation. Isolation puts you in very close contact with yourself. You can't distract yourself any longer, so you're left with your own thoughts, repeating delirious patterns, second guessing yourself, second guessing your life, and your environment. If you do meditation wrong (succumb to these patterns instead of returning to your breath), it can drive you insane, literally inducing psychotic lapses.<p>Yet if you do it right, your mind become incredibly calm and alert. Concentration becomes easy, your mind snaps into gear with a tiny push. And you end up playing a game that's trivial to learn and unbelievably difficult to master. Slowly, you peal away layers of your psyche, becoming intimately familiar with it in the process, until you get to the pristine awareness your mind inherently has.<p>There is wisdom and strength in isolation.

I am just surprised that no one has <i>noticed</i> jar behaving strangely. As a developer, I am frequently on the lookout for programs that hit 100% CPU utilization. This is a very useful indicator. I have top running all the time. I don't run jar frequently... but if I did and it did hit 100% CPU, I would be curious indeed.<p>I have been at a new job for 2 weeks, using Java EE. My IDE and my application use tons of memory, and I am often waiting for it to respond. Why is it paused? My coworkers just say ""garbage collection"". But they don't know if that is, in fact, what's happening. If you see jar running at 100%, do you think ""oh it's just garbage collection"", or ""a bug, perhaps?""<p>Considering the fact that, there are millions of Java developers out there, that open source development has proven true the mantra ""with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow"", and that this jar bug has potentially been around for years... I am just surprised.<p>Also, as much as I would love to extrapolate meaning from your single anecdote, I suspect that some people out there are running jar a lot. In fact, the blog post's writer mentions that he was trying to address actual complaints of the user base. It is a ""well-known"" fact that jar is slow.",1242584031

It's supply and demand. Chickens for example will fight over food if it is not dispersed on the ground so they can all get to it.  They will fight and establish a hierarchy so they can all get to the food in an orderly manner.  Lions do it.  The males eat first because they are strongest, and on and on.<p>The difference with Engineers is that they see the world is full of opportunity for them so there is no lack of demand for their talents.<p>I've seen the ""violent"" approach with some of the less intelligent bosses I've had.  They'll try to fire you or damage your reputation within the organization.

With any sane DBMS this will result in the same performance improvement.<p>The problem with <i>that</i> is that it limits you to the amount of RAM you can throw into the DB. The biggest Memcache clusters reach well into the multi-terabyte range.<p>Secondly, you can use Memcache to store constructed objects which could take many DB calls (or CPU time) to generate. Now you're getting one Memcache hit instead of several DB hits, which is a distinct bonus.<p>Since it's shared-nothing, Memcache also gives you the ability to massively parallelize queries to many cache servers at once, and get a much quicker overall response than just hammering one DB into the ground.",1242583250

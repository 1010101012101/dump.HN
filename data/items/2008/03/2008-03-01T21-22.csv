He has done great work, knows a great deal about usability, hacking, etc. And he has taste. Yet he has completely failed to change anything, despite the fact that he is as high on the corporate ladder as you can get, and has a lot of clout within the company.<p>What that shows is that the corporate culture simply doesn't support what he has to offer, and that it is not willing to change in order to accomodate a new reality.<p>Same thing happened to IBM in the 90's.",1204408756
126867,comment,126793,126793,0,0,wallflower,,,"The power of this best-of-craigslist post is that he (a former partner-track and then partner-at-age-30 lawyer) talks about why he is happy with his post-superachiever life and at the same time - he does not condescend those people who choose to be slackers, homemakers, or McMansion home owners, or whatever they want to be (as long as it makes them happy)<p>I came across a definition of success on Friday that really resonated with me: Success is not about financial independence, a big house, or fame. It's about whether you are making progress towards worthy goals.<p>I like it because that allows us to feel we are succeeding now, rather than the proverbial later.",1204408723

The people who built the companies and science that made it possible and greatly elevated Britain never made anywhere near enough to compensate their investments of time and money.  They were irrational actors.  Clark argues they acted this way because of genetic predisposition -- a predisposition that was not widespread in other societies.",1204408470

In schools, it's the same sort of thing - nerds vs jocks, etc.<p>Being stupid is certainly not cool, but not exactly frowned upon in the retard-circles either :p<p>Our social customs are a problem because somehow the whole nation feels like it's not ""normal"" to strike up a casual conversation with someone you don't already know.<p>I think that's part of why we seem so introvert.

Did he just get good at particular math problems through repeatedly doing them, or did he gain a general math aptitude?  Given his performance later in life it seems like he gained the latter.<p>I became interested in math in a similar manner, and I think learning it this way gave me an edge over those who were just force fed it in school.  There is nothing like understanding the practical significance of a subject to make it stick in my mind and give me intuitive links.  This aspect of learning seems to be really lacking in public school, at least the ones I've attended.",1204407429

I would say they just don't have the <i>taste</i>. I guess  you just cannot create design marvels without <i>taste</i>. I'm still at a loss to figure out why Ray Ozzie couldn't add any magic to the recipe. I also think he's in agreement with MSFT-Yahoo acquisition. If so, then this is beyond my comprehension and they (MSFT) should admit that this is a problem they cannot solve. Even worst, they have lost focus on delivering quality desktop software (but thanks goodness there are investors like YCombinator and companies like Xobni :-). Vista is also miserable failure and a thorough rip-off. Remember Apple SE VP's comments?",1204407233

126847,comment,126608,126842,0,0,gruseom,,,"You remind me of a joke I heard, and I'm curious to know if it's a common one. It goes something like this: <i>A Finnish farmer answers a loud knock at his door to find a detachment of Russian soldiers. The officer informs him that Russia is taking over this land and demands on penalty of death to know which side the farmer chooses to belong to, Finland or Russia. The farmer replies, ""It has always been my heartfelt wish to once again be part of mother Russia. But at my age, I couldn't take another Russian winter.""</i><p>I wonder if you would detect the ""passive-aggressive"" temperament you mention in this joke? It could be described that way, though it strikes me more as a kind of shrewdness, based in long experience of managing much more powerful neighbors. (I didn't know that Finland had gotten it from both sides.)",1204406909

But since this isn't possible I don't see an obvious way of resolving this.<p>Note by the way that the same mechanism applies to comments, particularly since the comments that are added later and therefore have no votes are displayed at the bottom, thus making it proportionally harder for them to make it to the top of the thread before it falls off the frontpage. The last argument assumes that users start from the top of the page, and don't always make it through all the comments to the bottom.

126842,comment,126608,126608,0,0,metoo,,,"I am a Finn and I agree on introversion. In our culture hard working in solitude is respected and showing your feelings is suppressed; both good for classroom study.
In sports this culture shows too: we do generally very bad in team sports.<p>The whole society is based on leveling differences.
The week ones drop out and the good ones are held back but on the average everything looks good. It is also very rare to be self-employed. If you want to accomplish something out of ordinary you have to leave the country; think of Linus Torvalds for example.<p>About history: Finland has been part of Sweden and Russian and we are still been constantly reminded about it. For example, our current president Tarja Halonen refuses answer questions about democracy in Russia. I think the whole country needs a psychotherapy about the Russia issue.<p>You should think a Finn as passive-aggressive, risk-avoiding, self-loathing, highly educated native with inferiority complex.

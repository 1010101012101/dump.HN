I.e. you can try to source info elsewhere in a longer input to decide between multiple possible translations for another bit. The problem is really these short inputs where no context is easily available to the program - it&#x27;s an input problem in some sense; it&#x27;s just much easier for a human translator to guess from cues the program simply has no input channels for. One of those cues is who exactly they&#x27;ve been hired by, though, and that can be replicated with user profiles, too.",1420243190
8829260,comment,8828775,8828775,0,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article: &quot;By the time Esperanto got out of the gate, another language was already emerging as an international medium: English.&quot; Yep. Esperanto is toast as a world interlanguage compared to English. The number of new speakers added to English each year just by natural increase of households in which English is spoken as a home language is, matched for levels of proficiency, comfortably greater than the total worldwide number of speakers of Esperanto. (The same is true, of course, of Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Spanish, and Hindustani.) English is by far the language of choice in &quot;interlanguage&quot; contexts, as for example when a native speaker of Korean travels to Taiwan (I have seen this many times) or when a native speaker of Japanese travels to China (I have seen this too) or even when educated native speakers of various Sinitic languages meet up and some are not proficient in standard Mandarin (I have seen this plenty of times too). The use of English as an interlanguage in India alone (where mandating Hindi as the sole interregional language would be very politically contentious) ensures that English will continue to grow and thrive, even if the United States and Britain somehow disappeared from the world. (I have been watching a lot of films from India recently, as my town is blessed with more than one cinema that show current films from India, and even in a movie set in India with entirely Indian characters, you will hear little snatches of English embedded in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, or Malayalam dialog, and you will always see signs in English in street scenes even of very rural places.)<p>So, yes, what will the world speak only a century from now, as the article asks? Plenty of other languages, for sure, and I for one am glad I devoted years to learning Chinese and German and other languages, but there will be more and more people speaking English in more and more places as the years go by.",1420243185

Taylorism is horrific because it&#x27;s used by people with power, a managerial class, to micromanage and exploit workers. But measurement on its own isn&#x27;t problematic; think of the quantified self movement, or athletes who used detailed self-study to improve their own performance.<p>I&#x27;ve been on teams that did a lot of self-measurement, and it has generally been fine. But the problems I recall are when people with managerialist inclinations seize upon something measured and use it to try to sound smart or exert control. E.g., the time a CEO, on his occasional visits, noticed our project LoC measurement. <i>We</i> all knew the dangers of that number, and treated it very lightly. But he kept trying to do MBA math with it (e.g., $/LoC), and I ended up having to tell him that if he didn&#x27;t knock it off, we&#x27;d stop displaying the metric.",1420243021

8829199,comment,8827600,8829050,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"The advantage of OO has always been its accessible constructs and abstractions that mirror how we talk about things linguistically. Nouns are just sticky that way. It isn&#x27;t a big delta over procedural programming, and you can find object systems in many C programs written before OOP was even a word. Heck, even Clojure has its own object systems; they just often call them entities rather than objects (what is an entity? well, its an object, but not the object you are used to). I think our current OO abstractions suck, but the paradigm is OK, especially when considered in the abstract (go back to the treaty of Orlando to see how diverse objects can be!). And the biggest pushers of objects in the early day were CLOS people like Richard P Gabriel, and CLOS (edit: Flavors actually as lipsm points out) gave us mixins, which are a pretty advanced OO construct (though RPG argues the mixins that got adopted in OO languages were not the ones CLOS intended).<p>People were using LISP in production in the 90s as an advantage, but then they were also using Smalltalk or Objective C also (ironically often in the same places...on Wall street). A new generation is discovering LISP while learning other languages first, but the phenomena is the same: OO was just less popular in the past and so they would come from C or Perl instead of Java.<p>[edit: not sure why you were downvoted, I thought your post was completely reasonable]",1420241988

The point is subtle and hard to express: carcinogens set the odds, but importance of the part of the risk due to &quot;biological luck,&quot; the part that comes from the mutation chain, means whether you individually are affected is random in a way that makes it hard to bother protecting yourself.<p>Let&#x27;s say (arbitrary numbers) having poisonium in the food supply increases the lifetime population rate of cancer of the thingamajig from 0.11% to 0.12%.  In the US, banning poisonium will save 300 million * (0.12%-0.11%) = 30,000 people, very predictable and important.  However, if you personally go on a poisonium-free diet, you decrease your personal risk by 0.01%.  You chances go from about 1 in 1000 to about 1 in 1000... so maybe if it involves any effort, you should spend your time doing something else to improve your health.<p>It&#x27;s different if the carcinogens targeted specific vulnerable groups.  If there was one gene that makes you instantly get cancer at the first whiff of poisonium, we would screen everyone for that gene.  The difference between the 0.12 and 0.11 would be due that gene.  Everyone with that gene would be put on poisonium-free diets.  Everyone else can eat all the poisonium they want, and would still have 0.11 risk.  (This is more or less the situation with the active ingredient in aspartame sweetener, though the disease is not cancer)<p>I don&#x27;t like the use of the word &quot;luck&quot; in these descriptions, since both genetic and mutation chain randomness are a kind of luck.  Also, the studies give quality numbers across many cancers, but the basic concept has been a mainstream model of cancer risk for a long time.",1420241759

8829136,comment,8824691,8824691,0,0,patcon,,,"Hm. This was a hodgepodge. I really sympathized with many criticisms, but others lacked focus.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m frustrated with the author picking on the idea of police officers wearing cameras. I&#x27;m interested in how we can decentralize and unpackage law enforcement services, so this hit home for me. I&#x27;d like to expound on (de)centralization, community and transparency for a sec, if I can be indulged.<p>Democracy and society today implies distributed power (citizens) mediated by necessary centralized power (law enforcement, elected representatives, judicial systems). This was a choice we made as our societies grew, as it was the only one that technology (postal service, telegraph, horse, guns, etc.) allowed at the time we were working through our options.<p>The small, manageable communities of our past were ones where everyone knew everyone else. There was gossip. Secrets were hard. But this was bundled up with the security we had in these communties. We&#x27;re being dishonest if we become nostalgic for that security and community, and yet conveniently deny the nakedness that is implied.<p>Democracy has been the only way we&#x27;ve known stability in recent history. But it doesn&#x27;t mirror these small communities of our past. We trusted centralized powers to mediate the trust relationships the we lost when we grew up. This allowed us to live in a world where we didn&#x27;t need to ask transparency. So we got used to that being a norm in a society where we felt security and stability.<p>But if we want to build more decentralized a robust societies, we need to accept that sometimes radical transparency is needed for certain institutions to lose their corruptible centers. We need radical transparency for any institution that operates at the scale where we can&#x27;t know and trust one another through the nakedness of personal relationships. We CAN build a decentralized society that has privacy, and we should demand that privacy for situations where it need not be sacrificed. But we can&#x27;t always demonize all forms  of radical transparency, as this is the crucial element that will allow the most corruptible of our institutions to be reimagined.<p>OK, sorry, this was perhaps a bit of a rant. If you&#x27;re thinking in similar areas, perhaps the words above will resonate with you. Otherwise, it might sound like an abstract rambling :)",1420240927

In cosmology, this is known as the Cosmological Principle[0], which is expressed in the language of the field as homogeneity of the matter distribution of the universe. Implicit hypotheses with this is that fundamental constants are constant and the laws of physics are the same. The basic idea is the assumption that the Earth is not special, therefore, experiments done here, while accounting for particular effects like earth&#x27;s gravity, being a non-inertial frame, etc., would be representative of any point other point of space.<p>And it&#x27;s not that this is a bad assumption. For example, spectra analysis of elements on earth has given us good ways to figure out the elements of stars far out of reach, and it is one hell of a coincidence that the spectra we see in stars is so similar to elements here like hydrogen and helium that one can&#x27;t assume that earth was just gifted with these elements while other parts weren&#x27;t.

One, it requires tuning on both ends of the connection to make the high speed transfers work well (and it looks like it will interfere with multiplexing as well, the reason the fixed window exists in the first place).<p>Two, the &quot;none&quot; cypher which it enables completely undermines the security of the secure shell. The cypher renegotiation after authentication would make it trivial to MITM the connection. You could probably disable the cypher after every transfer by restarting the sshd daemon, but that&#x27;s being a bit optimistic.<p>Finally, there is no visible license on the patchfile, or on the homepage. The project&#x27;s sourceforge page lists it as being BSD licensed, but there is no indication from the author that this is the case.<p><a href=""http://www.psc.edu/index.php/hpn-ssh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psc.edu/index.php/hpn-ssh</a>",1420239767

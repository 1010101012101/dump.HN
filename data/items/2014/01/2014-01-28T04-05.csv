7135409,comment,7134433,7134932,6,0,ruswick,,,"This makes sense. These policies are probably warranted for actual credit card companies. But, the OP&#x27;s grievance was with Square, which isn&#x27;t liable for fraud and probably doesn&#x27;t need to use such excessive security.<p>Frankly, it often seems as though many consumer financial companies (like Mint and Square, etc.) go out of their way to make their service harder to use simply to increase their &quot;legitimacy.&quot;<p>Sites like Mint refuse to remember login information and automatically log users out after a short period of time. As far as I&#x27;m aware actual bank account can&#x27;t be accessed from Mint; data is only reported. In the grand scheme, this information is not particularly important.<p>It would be far more catastrophic for someone to gain access to my email account or social network profiles (where they could actually do damage) than it would be for them to learn what (little) I have in my bank account. Yet, we all survive using only standard security on most of our other accounts.<p>Moreover, there seems to be a huge disparity between credit card security in the real world and credit card security online anyway. In the real world, I hand my credit card to numerous people with whom I have no relationship and whom I can&#x27;t trust at all, every single day. No one thinks twice. Yet, when someone wants to look at their bank statement, they need to bend over backwards. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Integral pieces of the financial apparatus might need to be totally secure, but consumer web apps that don&#x27;t ever handle money don&#x27;t, and should put user experience first.",1390884954

I&#x27;ve been interested in computational vaccine design and HIV evolutionary dynamics for a long time.  I kind of see the whole thing as a dynamical system and a hidden Markov model.  Essentially since the copy mechanism is leaky and produces multiple variants, and the immune system produces a selective response, how do you know that the single epitope you vaccinate against will be sufficient?  I would expect their to be multiple stable populations and hence a need multiple vaccine epitopes (including populations that are stable under specific drug regimes).<p>This is what makes rgejman&#x27;s phage display comments so interesting.

C presents a simple &quot;big array of bytes&quot; memory model that totally abstracts all that complexity. And machines go to great lengths to maintain that fiction.</i><p>When C was invented, it was very close to reality.  It isn&#x27;t anymore, as you point out.  (But as another commenter said, assembly language isn&#x27;t that close to reality either)<p>Unfortunately hardware guys and software guys didn&#x27;t really coordinate, and we just hacked shit up on either side of the instruction set interface.<p>It is kind of ironic that we write stuff mostly in &quot;serial&quot; languages.  But the compiler turns into a parallelizable data flow graph.  Then that&#x27;s compiled back to a serial ISA.  And then the CPU goes and tries to execute it in parallel.<p>It would be a lot nicer if we wrote stuff in parallel/dataflow languages, and the CPU could understand that!  Some dilletantism with FPGAs made me realize how mismatched CPUs are for a lot of modern problems.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the idea that Java throws away its type information when compiling to byte code, and then the JIT reconstructs the types at runtime.

Hopefully not, but unless you have scanned every line of every include file included in your current context recently, as well as every line of code preceding the current one in the file you&#x27;re reading, you just can&#x27;t know.

That said, let&#x27;s analyze some actual use case..<p>a) Page A currently inlines half dozen small assets on every page. These inlined resources inflate every page and are delivered at same priority as HTML. By contrast, a &quot;dumb push&quot; server delivers these same assets as individual resources via push. Net benefit? Basically same performance since inlining is a form of application-layer push. However, a smart server can at least prioritize and multiplex push bytes in a smarter way... Now, let&#x27;s make the server just a <i>tiny</i> bit smarter. If it&#x27;s the same TCP connection and the server has already pushed the resource, don&#x27;t push it on next request. Now we&#x27;re also saving bytes... <insert own smarter strategy here>.<p>b) Page B has two CSS and one JS file in the critical rendering path. Without push you either inline all three (ouch), or, you roundtrip to the client and get it to parse the HTML to discover these resources and come back to the server... With push, the server can avoid the extra RTT and push those assets directly to the client -- this is a <i>huge</i> performance win. How does the server know? Well, either you made it smart.. or you use some adaptive strategy like looking at past referrers and building a map of &quot;when client requests X, they also come back for Y and Z&quot; - this is already available in Jetty.<p>The fears of extra bytes are also somewhat exaggerated (they&#x27;re valid, but exaggerated). The client, if they desire, can disable push. The client can also use flow-control to throttle how much data can be transferred in first push window (both FF and Chrome do this already). Lastly, the client can always decline and/or RST a push resource.<p>Some additional resources:\n- <a href=""http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch12.html#HTTP2_PUSH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch12.htm...</a>\n- <a href=""http://www.igvita.com/2013/06/12/innovating-with-http-2.0-server-push/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.igvita.com/2013/06/12/innovating-with-http-2.0-se...</a>",1390882089

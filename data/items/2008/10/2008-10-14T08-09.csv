How can you attribute the characteristics of a bunch of programmers you met in a small outsourcing company, to a whole country of 1.2 billion people?<p>There are more entrepreneurial and enterprising people in India than you think...",1223974798

332068,comment,332033,332033,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The problem from the other side is harder. Given that Google finds a talented startup team, how do they know that the startup is in a business that Google should be doing? Should Google ever turn down a good startup team? Most of what Google does is opaque to me. They are becoming the GE of the internet.<p>What is the purpose of a firm? Is it a collection of synergistic business ventures? A source of capital? Does it make sense to continually expand it's scope of activities? Would investors be better off if Google kept the equity it needed to run its search business and paid the rest out in a dividend to shareholders?<p>We think of the big boys as a black box - a black box full of money. I'd like to understand them, how they operate and how they could be better. I don't understand their purpose in pursuing many of these acquisitions, besides making sure their rivals don't buy the target first.",1223974245

332059,comment,331370,331801,0,0,callmeed,,,"No, you do well in search engines if they ""think"" your site is useful. I'd also argue that ""relevant"" is a better term than ""useful"". A site can be extremely useful to humans but not necessarily rank extremely well.",1223972833
332058,comment,330987,331066,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I can't find any fault in Krugman's academic work. I haven't read it, though it sounds fascinating. He is held in high regard in the academy, and I believe he is as talented as other people say he is.<p>His NY Times column, however, I feel fit to judge as shrill, unimaginative, vanilla leftism. I'm sure he understands all the criticisms that other economists would level at the policies he supports. The flaws are glaring. Now, it is perfectly honest to acknowledge the existence of those flaws and argue that the benefits of the policy outweigh the drawbacks. However, it is not honest to pretend that such criticisms do not exist.<p>I could read similar opinion pieces from any leftist without a PHD after his name. The point of reading someone so lettered is that his opinions should be well-argued and therefore interesting, even if you disagree with him. That is rarely the case with Krugman.<p>I have no doubt that his work in economics will be remembered 50 years from now, and his columns will be long forgot.",1223972245

The guy with the electrode apparently pushed the button thousands of times within a short period of time. It's just scary to think - I suspect nobody would have the will power to escape that drug. Which in turn shows how clever nature has programmed us (somehow making us DO things), and how little we really determine our fates.",1223971290

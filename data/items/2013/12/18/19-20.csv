6930162,comment,6928425,6928425,2,0,philosophus,,,"Nietzsche describes &quot;der letzte Mensch&quot; as the lowest form of human life. His scientific materialism is the most degrading, smallest illusion, worse than any religious dogma. The last man has regressed to the thoughts of what we used to call &quot;beasts,&quot; that is, life which is concerned with, can only understand, biological sustenance. Even that may be overly generous, as beasts can be at least curious. His religion, such as it is, is survival, or, at the most, health.<p>He is not so much scientific as scientistic. Science, understood as a type of mathematical empiricism, is not metaphysical. Empirical rigor prevents the authentic scientist from making claims about the existence of God or the proper ends of human life -- or about science itself. When one&#x27;s gaze turns from the empirically quantifiable to examine the scientific method itself, one has started doing philosophy. One cannot look through the microscope and look at the microscope at the same time.<p>The idea that science is a metaphysical system rather than a method for modeling the world mathematically is scientism. Scientism makes claims that are not susceptible to mathematical analysis or reproducible experiments; that is what distinguishes it from science. These claims include: the world as perceived by human senses is the primary or ultimate reality; science is the best way of understanding the world; God (the Hebraic, infinite God) does not exist; health (understood as reproductive fitness) is the primary object and standard of value of human life. These are all metaphysical or moral claims and as such do not describe objects in the world or physical matter that can be examined by the scientific method.<p>Scientism leads naturally to pseudo-science. If you believe in scientism, then you believe that &quot;science&quot; can provide answers to metaphysical and moral questions. If you believe that, then you believe things like <a href=&quot;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131217210540.htm&quot;>this</a>\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131217210540.ht...</a> are scientific, rather than pseudo-science. It is pseudo-science because it is based on beliefs concerning what is better as the end of life. Such beliefs are not susceptible to mathematical modeling and are therefore not part of science.<p>Pseudo-science leads to progressivist political ideologies. Karl Marx is merely the most infamous proponent of &quot;scientific materialism,&quot; his term for a baroque and metaphysical religion. It is a religion, based on scientistic historical analysis, atheism, and economics as the valuation of human flourishing. Following the disastrous horrors of the Soviet and Maoist experiments, few today openly fly the Communist banner, but similar ideals persist in more subtle forms.<p>Progressivism, because it is inherently a metaphysical system based on mythological pseudo-science, views Christianity as infidels. As in Islam, the infidel is sometimes tolerated, sometimes more aggressively attacked. Militant atheism distinguishes itself from science by, again, making metaphysical claims about the nature of reality instead of mathematically modeling certain phenomena, and further by enacting legislation (or more thug-like vigilantism) enshrining its particular mythology (scientism). The infidel, as again in Islam, is not argued with but attacked in a jihad, whether through official legislation or &quot;activism.&quot;",1387396509

Use the MIT License instead.<p>The motive behind using WTFPL is obvious: It&#x27;s novel, it&#x27;s a bit whimsical, and it dispenses with the stuffiness of normal licenses — but besides the fact that it&#x27;s becoming an old joke, WTFPL really isn&#x27;t much better than no license at all, and here&#x27;s why.<p>Google Code provides a good explanation[1] of why releasing your code into the public domain is bad for your project. First, people in certain countries (e.g. France) won&#x27;t be able to fork your project. But more importantly: &quot;it&#x27;s somewhat risky to release code without explicitly disclaiming liability or warranty; you&#x27;re potentially opening yourself to lawsuits from accidental damage that may result from somebody using your software.&quot;<p>This is the key, and it&#x27;s why most software license include an all-caps disclaimer of warranty and liability. The WTFPL doesn&#x27;t have this, which is why you should choose an equally permissive (but more protective, for you) license, e.g. MIT.<p>Here&#x27;s a good comparison of different licenses: http://web.archive.org/web/20090317083515/http://developer.kde.org/documentation/licensing/licenses_summary.html<p>[1] https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/FAQ#Can_I_host_code_that_I_have_placed_in_the_public_domain?",1387395250

It&#x27;s still one of the best investments of the year, if you compare it to pretty much everything else (the stock market, gold price, options, housing, oil, you-name-it). When the fed tapering program begins, I think we are going to see a similar (though probably not as drastic) drop in the stock market as well, which I also believe to be overinflated. That hits a lot of people too, most of whom have their retirement funds built on it. It&#x27;s just the nature of investing, which I have a lot of trouble at times isolating from the idea of gambling.<p>The real lesson here is that if you&#x27;re just trying to get into Bitcoin to make easy money, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. People should be hesitant of get rich quick schemes in general, and in altcoins in particular. When friends and family ask if they should buy Bitcoin, I immediately warn them that getting into Bitcoin solely on price increase speculation is akin to gambling or stock investing and should be treated as such. As Roger Ver said, Bitcoin&#x27;s price is the least interesting thing about it. What excites me about Bitcoin is the ability to control your own purchasing power, and not require a central system (bank, payment processor) to manage and send it. Bitcoin is still at an incredibly early stage in its development, and like anything, there is a lot of uncertainty now, and to come.<p>It&#x27;s not my intention to gloat, but I want to give you a positive story against all this. I sold enough of my ownership of Bitcoin at about $950/BTC to pay my usual salary in USD for an entire year, which will allow me to work on Coinpunk and Neocities full-time, and have some extra funds to pay people that help me work on it. I have never had this opportunity in my life, and I&#x27;m really excited about it. It&#x27;s like getting angel investment without the investor, and it gave me complete autonomy to do for the project what I feel is right. For me (and for people that were sensible about it), it&#x27;s been a very good year.<p>My prediction is that the China situation is going to get sorted out eventually. But sure, until that happens, the value of Bitcoin has fallen because of concerns about liquidity. If the US banned the ability to exchange dollars, I imagine you would see a similar drop in its value as well. And it&#x27;s looking like most countries are invariably going to not ban Bitcoin. The US hearings in particular were quite positive. If China&#x27;s government decides it&#x27;s done with Bitcoin, it just means that other countries will have the opportunity to become the leader in Bitcoin startups. And that&#x27;s also a positive thing for me ultimately, but sadly, not as much for future entrepreneurs in China. As someone that works on startups for a living, I would always rather have a level playing field than be given an opportunity due to a punitive effect.",1387394996

Get ready for it. \nCriticizing the carbon footprint of bitcoin is a joke compared to the carbon footprint of depth dollars.<p>Regarding the future of bitcoin, my feeling is that it has the value of tracability which is very attractive for the police states we are evolving to. So I expect states might continue to tolerate it as long as it doesn&#x27;t accelerated the dollar buble blast and present a threat.<p>Another current problem of bitcoin is that it&#x27;s value is so much rising by speculation that it prevents it to start being used as a commercial currency. Illegal business activity is indeed a problem, but its tracability leaves a track. I wouldn&#x27;t assume that it&#x27;s free play for all illegal business.

Prove that you can own an effective marketing channel that is unavailable to competitors.<p>* Build out whatever parts of the business are possible using human labor in replacement for code and demonstrate actual customer demand, validated by at least $100/month of revenue. Use spreadsheets in place of a database, text messages from your phone in place of notifications etc. and demonstrate where automation can lead to easy efficiency gains. Prove that there even is room for technology as a core competency of this startup.<p>* List out at least 3 major learnings, lay out what your original assumption was, what data prompted you to change your mind and what implications this learning has on all aspects of the business.

A finite asset that is easy to transfer over long distances without central interferance really is unprecedented.<p>I think you have bought in to the bitcoin fantasy that it will be the only currency in use.  I don&#x27;t think that will ever happen for a variety of reasons.  If gold and fiat can coexist why not bitcoin too?. \nLoaning bitcoins seems to be a crazy proposition, so I suspect inflationary currencies will stick around just for that reason.  Not to mention bitcoin by itself is fairly terrible for in person transactions, if you add a service on top what is the difference for the customer between that and a credit card company?.  Fiat is useful and solves problems that bitcoin doesn&#x27;t.<p>Regarding mining, I have my own concerns, bitcoin proponents love to describe mining as “securing the network” and equate it with vaults and security guards used in banks.  This comparison is at least partly flawed, mining prevents double spends and nothing else.  It&#x27;s certainly true that a centralized ledger could prevent double spends for tiny fraction of the cost of mining, but globally who can be trusted by all parties to adminster it?.  The comparison isn&#x27;t one sided however, it is much cheaper to securely store (and move) bitcoins than gold for example.<p>Energy use is tricky, preserving the environment should be a top a priority, but should we aspire to use less energy?.  One question I have often asked but never got a good answer to, how much of the worlds energy needs to be devoted to mining to prevent a 51% attack?.  If it is north of 30% of the worlds energy output then right now that would seem a huge waste.  But if we had access to cheaper, cleaner renewable energy, would it still be a problem?.<p>Malware?, it&#x27;s just a symptom of larger problem, computer security is terrible.  No one is really sure who to plame, users, applications, operating systems and hardware makers all come into the firing line.  If bitcoin pushes forward computer security surely that can only be a good thing?.<p>I&#x27;m unconvinced about whether greshams law applies to mining due to the performance disparity between ASICs and CPU/GPUs, but surely if computer security improves this problem diminishes?.",1387393442

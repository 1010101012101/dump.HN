If Go would use some kind of union/variant type in those cases, then yes, that would cost you performance. But something like this is rather common in contemporary statically compiled languages, as nobody wants to uselessly repeat himself (cf. Java's ""FrobnicationType frobnicatorVariable = new FrobnicatorType(initialValue)"").<p>It's mostly a matter of style and verbosity, the only thing you have to care about is that you can't use the "":="" outside of functions.

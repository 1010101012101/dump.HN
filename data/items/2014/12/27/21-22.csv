This isn&#x27;t the first time that I&#x27;ve encountered brain teasers, and I know that I dislike them because I generally suck at them. The author characterizes this as being a &quot;cognitive miser&quot; (I also hate it when people make up terms), or not putting forth the effort to thoroughly think through the problem and just going with the easy answer. I can accept that this is what&#x27;s happening, but what the hell does it mean?<p>Should we be hiring people who are good at brain teasers? Does that kind of thinking indicate the ability to ship products, come up with novel solutions or understand things in a way that leads to significant increases to the bottom line? In my experience, everybody is some kind of stupid. Even puzzle masters occasionally lose their keys or say embarrassing things at parties. Intelligence and the lack there of is so fractured and interconnected that it doesn&#x27;t seem like any kind of test is going to be able to measure it accurately, or even nail down what &#x27;it&#x27; is.<p>Some of the smartest people I know were good at questions like this, or maybe I just think they&#x27;re smart because they&#x27;re so good at these questions. Big companies love to use them during interviews and there&#x27;s probably a reason for that. It&#x27;s definitely a skill I would like to improve myself, but I still don&#x27;t fully understand the value. Life isn&#x27;t a series of puzzles, it&#x27;s a series of problems punctuated by sheer randomness. Being able to take this or any kind of test can&#x27;t be highly correlated with &quot;success&quot; by most measures, and certainly not in the ways that matter to most organizations.",1419717507

I use it because I don&#x27;t want auto-starting audio, <i>ever</i>. I have 30-60 tabs up at any given time. When an ad starts playing audio, it disrupts my entire workflow, possibly disturbs my partner sleeping next to me, etc.<p>In short, auto-start audio in ads is quite simply so far outside of what I consider acceptable behavior, that I&#x27;m willing to burn the whole goddamned business model to the ground to stop it. I disable AdBlock Plus for sites that I know to behave responsibly with regard to their ads (reddit, probably a couple of others). If there were a list of Advertising Good Citizens who never use auto-starting audio ads (such a list would probably need to demand a few other things, like a good privacy policy, no popups/popunders, etc., but audio is the single reason I installed AdBlock Plus), that could be dropped into AdBlock Plus, I would happily use it. I don&#x27;t mind ads, but the second somebody disrupts my work, my conversation on Skype, my partner&#x27;s sleep, my music listening, etc. is the second I grow to hate the site and the advertiser.",1419717286

8804088,comment,8803389,8803389,0,0,Mz,,,"One thing you can do is make your peace with the fact that it will take a couple of minutes or so to refocus. So assume that three 30 minute blocks of time are worth at least six minutes less than an uninterrupted 90 minute block of time. Yes, that&#x27;s frustrating, but may not be as huge a loss as you think: You can still get about 84 minutes worth of work done. It adds up over time. Also, if those 30 minute blocks are in quick succession, it will take even less time to get back in the groove than if there are large interruptions that make you completely lose your train of thought and, thus, require you to reread things and so on in order to figure out where you were.<p>While I am on that topic, one way to be more productive when your focus is broken up is to find ways to track where you left off. If you do a lot of reading of dead leaf materials, book darts can mark the exact line you were on when you stopped, which can prevent you from scanning two pages to find where you were. Online, leaving things open at the place on the page you last scrolled to and similar. I try to open tabs I need to do something with later even if I can&#x27;t get to it just yet so I will, at some point, check that tab and go &quot;Oh, yeah. I need to do that thing.&quot; Otherwise, I may completely forget about doing that thing at all on that day. It may get ignored until the next day -- or the day after or whatever.<p>I also found it helpful at BigCo to make a spreadsheet and track certain things. Creating the spreadsheet took just a few minutes, updating it took a few seconds here and a few seconds there. The amount of stress and distraction from worry it saved me was worth many times the amount of time sunk into creating a simple tracking mechanism.",1419717229

It assumes &quot;married&quot; and &quot;unmarried&quot; are mutual exclusive and span the entire space of possibilities. This does not appear to line up with reality in ways I find compelling. Nations may recognize people as married, but due to laws about common law marriage, differing requirements for marriage (very few people who consider themselves married in America filled out the proper paperwork for Tajikistan, a foolish and impossibly rare oversight, the test seems to assume), and many other X factors, it is completely reasonable to assume that people can be neither married nor unmarried, or that George is not married but both married and unmarried, or many other things.<p>I think if we got code for this, if it used numbers of booleans, or really any system we are familiar with on computers, we wouldn&#x27;t make this error -- not due to differences in how we think but differences in the object level discussion we would be having.",1419717165

You don&#x27;t see a lot of obese animals in nature, regardless of any genetic metabolic mutation, because they have to actually work to acquire their food.<p>In theory yes, but the vast majority of people who try to lose weight through diet fail.

8804080,comment,8803389,8803389,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"The best algorithm for interruptions I know is the one that computers use: the journaling filesystem [0].<p>The way it works is simple.  When you want to do a disk operation, first, you write down in a special place (called a <i>journal</i>) what you are going to do, at a high level.  &quot;I&#x27;m going to delete this directory and all its files.&quot;  Then, you go through the steps of actually doing that.  Finally, you record in your journal that&#x27;s what you did.<p>Now when power is interrupted during a disk operation you simply look at the journal and you can complete any operations that were in-flight at the time of the interruption.  For example if the journal says &quot;Delete X folder&quot; and you see it still exists, now you can pick up where you left off.<p>The application to interruptible programming is straightforward.  I have an actual paper journal and I will in a few words explain a task to the journal before I begin.  Often I end up with a hierarchical journal, like<p><pre><code>    get the unit tests to pass\n        the unit test doesn&#x27;t pass on OSX because postgres isn&#x27;t running\n            start postgres\n        the unit test doesn&#x27;t pass on Linux because the postgres credentials are wrong\n            refactor postgres credentials to work right on both platforms\n        one particular Linux machine still doesn&#x27;t work\n            Is it 32-bit related?\n                No\n            Are we using the same compiler on that machine?\n</code></pre>\nThe overhead of recording this information is microscopic, and the benefit of returning from every interruption to a page or so of context is awesome.  It&#x27;s almost better to be interrupted now, because I come back to a clearly defined problem, as opposed to starting on &quot;blank slate&quot; items with no direction.<p>As a side benefit, I now write really good commit messages, because I just write what my journal says I did.  Which is quite a lot more detail than it was when I was trying to remember things after the fact.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system</a>",1419717132

You build for people you (probably) assume have eyes and ears and hands and written language and a financial system and a predictable reward mechanism and a notion of privacy and on and on and on. The only thing that makes a product &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; is its interaction with a massive stack of assumptions you&#x27;re making about the user.<p>But you only know like 0.000002% of the possible users of your product. So really you&#x27;re extrapolating wildly from a tiny set of clues about your user, based on signals sent to you by your culture. (Where &quot;culture&quot; is just the set of stuff that filters through to you about the people around you who you don&#x27;t know personally.) And that culture holds some people to be more &quot;normal&quot; than others. Consider (as just some examples) that test subjects start to see a crowd as half women when it&#x27;s much less than half. A movie poster with women on it is intended only for women; a poster with men on it is for everyone. A movie poster with only black people is intended only for black people; a poster with white people is for everyone ...<p>So the product you build is based on a dirty signal -- it incorporates a massive stack of assumptions about the user, derived from a culture that you know is lying to you about what a normal person is. If you build for your internal idea of a &quot;normal&quot; user, letting tech be tech, then you reinforce whatever happened to be handed to you without realizing you&#x27;re doing it. That&#x27;s why this is a conservative ideology.<p>&quot;Feminism&quot; in this context is a progressive tool -- it&#x27;s a way to look at your product with fresh eyes. How do anonymity tools look if we assume that all users are equally important, focusing on the experience of men vs. women? Huh, it seems that the user base includes a significant number of men who are hateful toward women, and that has a big impact on who participates in anonymous forums and how men and women experience them. Now we have a lot of different options for dealing with that (censorship being only one, and obviously not one the Tor project would choose). Before we* used this lens, our only option was to ignore it and preserve the status quo.<p>Other &quot;-isms&quot; are just other tools. Anything that your culture cares too much or too little about -- and therefore tends to lie to you about -- is a possible lens to learn about users you&#x27;re ignoring, because your mental model of &quot;normal&quot; doesn&#x27;t match reality.<p>(* Note I&#x27;m not at all affiliated with Tor, just using &quot;we&quot; generally here.)",1419716111

This happens all the time and is the basis for procrastination.  2) Your brain is tired and telling the truth -- you don&#x27;t have the mental resources to focus right now.  This happens to me after about 60-90 minutes of concentration, and it takes 20-30 minutes of &quot;lightening up&quot; to recharge. (Note that these numbers are taken in the absence of major stressors like babies and in-laws.  You may also need to eat, sleep, or perform some other kind of self-care to recharge.)<p>In case (1), it&#x27;s fun to imagine that your brain is maliciously lying to you about the progress you&#x27;ll be able to make, but it&#x27;s more ignorance than malice.  Get good at recognizing the real obstacles and talking yourself through them.  Is there some key piece of understanding you&#x27;re missing, or some design problem you couldn&#x27;t solve in your head?  When you have to go long periods during your day without access to your tools, you&#x27;ll build up questions that you need the Internet, a computer, or pen and paper to answer.  Remember what they are; don&#x27;t just unconsciously make assumptions or treat these questions as unanswerable.  Another mental blocker besides lack of understanding is worrying prematurely about the properties the finished product must have (it must be good, it must be well-written, it must look beautiful, it must be a complete treatment of the subject, etc.).  Another blocker is stacking up tasks in your head so that one blocks another -- I don&#x27;t want to do B until I&#x27;ve done A, but I don&#x27;t have the mental energy (or other resource) to do A right now, but I should just force myself to, but I can&#x27;t...  These blockers will dissolve once you recognize them and look at them properly.  If you feel any resistance to working on a task (whether it&#x27;s a short, 20-minute task or a longer task to make progress on), immediately ask yourself why.<p>It&#x27;s particularly frustrating, for example, if a 20-minute task is put in the front of your queue, ahead of your &quot;real work&quot; that constitutes &quot;real progress.&quot;  A bug pops up, or a configuration issue with your computer, or an urgent email, or a git conflict.  You thought you&#x27;d have just enough time to implement and test feature X, which is just a one-line change, and now there&#x27;s no chance.  There&#x27;s not much to do about these things except to recognize them, and to adjust your definition of &quot;real work&quot; and &quot;real progress&quot; to account for them.  If you were going to use the time to dump ideas, code, or text from your head, dump notes into a text file for a couple minutes.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: the limits of 20-30 minute work blocks are real and not all in your head.  You can go to far-off places when you have hours to immerse yourself in something, and in addition, just the knowledge that you have this time seems to unlock creative thinking.  However, don&#x27;t believe everything you hear about what&#x27;s possible in 20-30 minute chunks either.<p>I&#x27;m writing about time management generically or from the point of view of a programmer, but it depends on the nature of the task.  I&#x27;ve never worked closely with a PM, so I don&#x27;t know what sorts of tasks we&#x27;re talking about.  20 minutes sounds perfect for answering an email or two that doesn&#x27;t require too much writing.  When I have to write a longer email or a design doc, blog post, etc., I write in my head while doing other things and then dump it out, or I dictate into a voice recorder (which is valuable for getting ideas out whether or not I later listen to the recording).<p>I echo what others have said about keeping your work windows open on your computer, and keeping a log of ideas and what you&#x27;re going to do next when you come back.

My personal policy is to write or say whatever I think should be said, whenever I think it should be said, how I think it should be said and to whom I think it should be said. Of course, such a policy can only be successfully exercised when it&#x27;s simmered in the virtue of prudence (i.e. its ongoing cultivation). I claim no particular success with regard to the latter, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.<p>Religion is a virtue, classically speaking, and true religion ought to be spoken of, publicly and privately, in season and out of season.<p><i>RELIGION: the moral virtue by which a person is disposed to render to God the worship and service he desrves. It is sometimes identified with the virtue of justice toward God, whose rights are rooted in his complete dominion over all creation. Religion is also a composite of all the virtues that arise from a human being&#x27;s relationship to God as the author of his or her being, even as love is a cluster of all the virtues arising from human response to God as the destiny of his or her being. Religion thus corresponds to the practice of piety toward God as Creator of the universe. (Etym. probably Latin religare, to tie , fasten, bind, or relegere, to gather up, treat with care.)</i><p>– Fr.

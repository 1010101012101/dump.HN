He, presumably, has very little capital, and so should look only at those places that Google is CERTAIN to avoid in the development of its 'Lively' offering.  A clear area that Google will avoid is the 'RuneScape' area, or any game serving teenage boys.<p>Also, if we consider the possibility that you are correct, and 'Lively' will be a hit for a year or two before people move on, this young man will still have trouble.  You see during that time he will need to run his own service for free.  Additionally, all of Google's users will be learning that everything should be free.  When they are bored with Google, they will come to him looking for free entertainment.  See the problem?",1215898547

With email you can host your own, use your companies, use a free provider (hotmail, gmail, etc) or use your ISP.<p>It's not possible for one company/person to get across all your email because you can have it somewhere else.  It's not possible to store Facebook info outside of facebook.<p>I imageine a distributed social network being a woven fabric where some people host their own, some use their companies (think bands using their labels server), a lot of people use free ad-based services (think hotmail or yahoo diaspora).  However, no one company would ever have all your data, and couldn't hold it to ransom, assuming some type of export facility is built into the design.  For I can import all my emails into a different server, but I can't export all my facebook data.  Once switching costs are reduced to negligible, then competition for features, usability and, yes, privacy, wins out.

While it's very dynamic most code is fairly static. You setup classes with methods, instantiate objects of those classes, and send them messages. Methods are cached after the first lookup and unless you are doing very dynamic things the subsequent messages find the corresponding method rather quickly. This is old stuff and you'll find it in Smalltalk, Self, and since Rubinius is based on the blue book I bet even Ruby. It's called inline caching[1]. If you need performance in a tight loop or something you drop into C, and this is encouraged. If your Obj-C code is too slow then you optimize it. In most cases this is entirely unnecessary or has been done for you at a lower level.<p>Without some numbers you can't expect anyone to take these claims seriously.

If someone wants to use GNU GO in their app suddenly they're on the hook for the political restrictions the GPL imposes even if they're making no significant modifications to it? In this case restricting their freedom to distribute their app where and how they want to. Of course you should adhere to the licenses you use it's just an interesting parallel track of software license restrictions. Looking at it purely from the perspective of using outside code, with a license you have no control over, the primary difference here is who dictates the terms to you. Apple or FSF.

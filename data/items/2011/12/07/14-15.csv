3323981,comment,3313570,3322131,1,0,philwelch,,,"> The main reason: the decision matrix for Pascal's Wager introduces infinities; the many various ones you can construct for cryonics to win do not. (I suppose you could construct one with infinities, though I can't say I've ever seen one, and I don't think that construction would be tenable anyway.) Another: the fact that there are many constructs for cryonics decision matrices--Pascal's Wager is static in time, a ""Cryonic's Wager"" would be dynamic in time. Another: cryonics doesn't suppose anything supernatural--if cryonics can or can't work, there are physical reasons why, we don't just have to suppose the outcomes as baseless entities. Perhaps you should explain why you think Pascal's Wager is analogous here.<p>Not only is it analogous, but by your own reckoning it is in many ways weaker. I don't think there's any useful meaning or distinction in describing the Christian afterlife as ""supernatural"", incidentally--either it's the case or it isn't. In any case, the decision matrix for Pascal's Wager is something like:<p><pre><code>                 Believe        Disbelieve\n  Christianity   Heaven            Hell\n     True        (+ inf.)        (- inf.)\n\n  Christianity   No sinning          0\n     False       (- fin. net loss)\n</code></pre>\nAnd the decision matrix for cryonics:<p><pre><code>                Get Frozen         Don't Get Frozen\n   Can Be       Get Resurrected    0\n   Resurrected   (+ fin. net gain)\n\n   Cannot Be    Waste Money        0\n   Resurrected   (- fin. net loss)\n</code></pre>\nInterestingly, in some formulations of Christianity, hell consists of ordinary death rather than eternal torment, which would make the Pascal matrix even more similar to the cryonics matrix. In any case, Pascal's Wager is strictly stronger than the decision matrix for cryonics, depending on how much you value being able to sin.<p>> Yes... and? Every dollar you pay for ""X"" fits that.<p>Well, it rather puts the lie to the claim that you have nothing to lose by having your corpse frozen in liquid nitrogen rather than buried or cremated. You <i>do</i> have something to lose. $40k-$125k is a lot of money that might actually be needed by your survivors. If you are ridiculously wealthy or have no children it might be different.<p>> Regarding your horrid comment, I'll explicitly say it's horrid and most likely untrue (but feel free to factor it into your uncertainty about ""cryonics working""). If you're not going to bother defending that one, I'm not going to bother arguing against that one.<p>I would be glad to defend that statement: for one small example, you can just refer to demographic polling on the subject of gay marriage. Support for gay marriage is dependent upon age more than any other variable, which suggests that the passing of older generations will push the question into almost universal consensus within our lifetimes.<p>Now, let's be clear: this argument is against the wholesale cryonic preservation of large numbers of dead people. As long as cryonics remains restricted to a small number of eccentrics, there's no gain or loss either way; Ted Williams' severed head will not revert the far future back to 20th century social norms all by itself. If there are only a few frozen people, they will probably serve more as figures of curiosity and academic study. In fact, cryogenic preservation might provide useful information to people of the far future even in the absence of effective resurrection--by analogy, we would probably be very interested, today, to examine a well-preserved physical specimen of centuries past, just as we've been interested in dissecting mummies and ice men. But if we take the pro-cryonics viewpoint to its natural conclusion, there are probably going to be millions of contemporary people resurrected possibly centuries from now. At that point, we will have either a very large politically disenfranchised population of 21st century people or a severe shock of regressive ultraconservatism. It would be the moral equivalent of colonialism, except in time rather than in space.<p>From what I've seen from cryonics proponents, yourself and ""Luke"" included, your basic method of argument is to make wild, largely unsubstantiated claims about life after death and then condemn all disagreement as ""horrid"" or ""evil"". If that's not religion, what is?<p>(If you want to continue this, feel free to email me. My address is in my profile.)",1323269877

Everyone is going nuts over the Samsung Galaxy S2 and/or the iPhone 4GS and HTC simply have nothing on the market that's even near competing.<p>You look at the fact that HTC are unsure of what they want to be, creating quality apps for Sense but Android incompatible meaning that once you flash you lose the apps completely. A prime example of this is the camera app. The cameras on HTCs generally suck, but HTC get the most out of them, however once you flash, all is lost as they've attempted to close themselves off.<p>Samsung are pretty much the go-to OEM for the highest specification phones and up till now, HTC have had the build quality. However if you oversaturate the market with average phones that can't compete with high specification phones, no one will care about build quality. HTC need to concentrate on making the type of phone you buy knowing you want to flash your phone and you might drop your phone on occasion.<p>And instead of investing in companies like Beats by Dre, how about them investing in the likes of Cannon or Nikon to make up for shortfalls they have which the likes of Samsung and Apple just don't have.<p>They need to understand that less is more and that owning a HTC should not feel the same for a Wildfire owner as it does for a Sensation owner.",1323268834

The problem is, the wrong problem is addressed by operating systems.<p>What you may mean by ""the highest-priority work (updating the UI)"" is really ""the lowest-latency work"".  What we perceive as UI quality is the latency of sucessive events - is it smooth, and fast.<p>But OSs only give us a big hammer to manage this - priority of threads. Which is very indirectly related to latency. E.g. priority inversion, blocking i/o, the stupid habit of putting OS threads strictly ahead of user threads, and on and on, all impact latency in a way the programmer cannot constrain.<p>Experimental OSs have tried to use latency as the fundnamental scheduling metric. But each time a new mainstream OS is released, lo and behold it's based on stupid old priority.<p>So let's acknowledge the fundamental fact, that we're not being given the tools to achieve what we need, and everything we do is a workaround that's more or less successful. It all glitches under the right (wrong) conditions, all approaches are hacks of one sort or another.",1323268498

We launched a preview in march this year which was well received and got some great feedback.<p>You can read how to use the service on the website, but let me explain here how it works underneath. When a new session is started, a person requesting support is redirected to our page which proxies all of the original website. The person joining the browser session will then be served the exact same resources without hitting the target server again. In addition, the first user's browser streams all the events happening on a page via a WebSocket connection, to be replayed on the viewing browser(s). The use of a proxy has two major benefits: the viewers are guaranteed to get the same resources and we can modify the resources to have the properties we need.<p>Still, there's ton of things that can (and will) go wrong.<p>Basically, we need the state of the javascript application to be identical on both sides, which is a hard problem as there are a lot of different variables at play.\nCurrently the service works with simple websites. The less advanced features you have, the better chance there is to have it working on a particular website. Eventually though, we plan to offer full HTML5 support.\nThe backend is built with Python/Gevent/Redis/Postgres. We also use C for processing html at ""real-time"" speed. Since we need to parse/modify/serialize almost every text resource, most of the Python parsers introduce unacceptable latency in browsing. Even crazy fast lxml is not good enough (performance-wise). We thus built our own single-pass parser based on a state machine.",1323268289

If you are thinking of moving across country, a UC school would look a lot better than the local school.  If you want to work locally, then the local school will be fine.  It may even be more helpful as there will be a larger local alumni network to tap into.  Using myself as an example, I went to a small liberal arts school practically nobody outside the mid-atlanic has heard of. Not exactly know for computer science either, in fact I think they only formed the major a about 2 or 3 years before I graduated(which was 2001!).  On the other hand it is well thought of locally and I had a job offer well before I graduated.  My first supervisor went this school.

As Digg was built on top of PHP, the company would hire too many developers that specialized in this language. Then, however, Rose noted, you end up with lots of PHP developers, but at some point, PHP isnt a problem anymore and you are stuck with all of those developers. At that point, said Rose, you end up having to hire a lot of developers that can do other things and dont know what to do with the old developers.""\n-------------------------------<p>OK - so don't <i>hire employees</i>, but contract with contractors.  Seems a pretty simple problem, yet few companies I talk to want to go down that route.<p>""We're looking for someone who's in it for the long haul"" or ""we value loyalty"" are some reasons I've heard from companies that won't consider contractors.<p>In some situations, that's probably fine.  In many other cases - fast tech-driven startup-type stuff - contracting probably makes more sense for precisely this reason.  The company's needs can change quickly, and having a lot of staff that don't know X but only Y is a competitive problem.<p>""But smart people can learn X too!""  Well, yes, to a point, but probably not as well as the people at your competition may already know it.  And who says all those smart people really <i>want</i> to learn X?  If you're really switching from Y to X, some Y devs may resent that, because Y can handle the workload too.  They may not put all the effort in to learning X, because they see it as a fad, or a dangerous pivot that is doomed to failure, etc.<p>""Smart people can learn new tech X too!"" is condescendingly treating devs as interchangeable parts while damning with some praise (""but they're smart!"")<p>""If your developers are either incapable of pivoting to a new language or flat out refuse to, then they are terrible developers.""<p>You've just done 3 years of Rails development, fighting all those version bugs, pulling all the late nighters, getting every rock solid and scaling out to the moon.

185337,comment,185288,185301,0,0,unimanz,,,"I agree with this somewhat. Traditionally businesses have been dependent on advertising or PR in order to promote their product, but increasingly there is value in inflitrating certain networks (e.g. early adopter crowd) so as to spread ""virally"". You could call this a new type of business promotion e.g. community adoption or maybe its just a new subset of PR, in which case, nothing much has changed.",1210322359

At least for my tech-oriented blog, the percentage of visitors using canvas-compatible browsers and the percentage with Java applets enabled is roughly the same. And the former is bound to get higher while the latter goes the other way. So for sites that have a high ratio of non-IE users that are concerned about subjecting those users to the various Java applet pains.",1210322221
185335,comment,185288,185332,0,0,vlad,,,"Great point.  I was just watching some Saturday Night Live clips on NBC's web site.  I was surprised that so many commercials one's forced to watch in their video area do not fit the mood of the site at all.  Even on the Internet, when the commercials could be targeted better, they are not.  This shows that traditional advertising networks that are transitioning to the Internet are still following the old approach, and it takes a new company to react to solve new problems and cater to Internet users rather than thinking of the Internet as a cheaper distribution source for traditional methods.  Old media wants a ""presence"" on the Internet, new media lives and breathes the Internet, and is made up of regular people who are the stars to their social circle.",1210322021

Why couldn't Google just do the same when you Googled for Cancun?""<p>That's the thing...with Facebook you don't have to search in order to be presented with relevent advertising. FB could parse natural language from the communications you are having with friends to display ads relevent to what you want now. Using my example above if i posted on my friends wall saying I am going to cancun then I would see the ads described above. However, that doesn't mean I woulnd't search in Google.<p>I agree, natural language parsing is very difficult but if Facebook could do that they may be on to a winner.",1210321986

185332,comment,185288,185288,0,0,paul,,,"You could make the same argument for why advertising won't work for TV, newspapers, and magazines.<p>Google's model is nearly optimal in many cases, but I believe many advertisers still spend the majority of their money outside of Google. The reason is that there are two kinds of advertising, roughly: meeting demand, and creating demand. Google is good for the former (""I'm looking for X""), and TV has been great for the latter (""want to be important? You need this expensive car"").",1210321791

It's not like VB6 users haven't had enough time to move over to VB.NET, and if they don't want to, they can still create applications using VB6.  Existing VB6 applications are not suddenly going stop working because Microsoft isn't officially supporting VB6.  What does 'support' mean anyway?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePla...</a>",1210321026

Why couldn't Google just do the same when you Googled for Cancun? That's not what Google does hit you with, but that's only because the market has decided that those ad slots should belong to travel agencies, etc. If ads ever took off on Facebook, it would presumably decide the same exact thing there.<p>I don't know about you, but like 99.9% of the population, when I travel to a new place I type it in Google first. I might type it into Facebook if I want to see if any of my friends will be there or have been there. But generally I'm Googling for what to do. It's gotten me through many new cities.<p>Also, you're giving Facebook too much credit for being able to parse natural language if you think this can scale for them. They might be able to target ads around specific keywords, but even that is going to be tough.",1210320891

185319,comment,185288,185288,0,0,unimanz,,,"> ""But they’ll never know what you want right now, and Google always does.""<p>Matt, this appears to be your killer point, that search allows advertisers to know what you want right now. The limitation with search however is that there are things I am very likely to want that I don't search for.<p>Let me use an example. Often when people are about to go on holiday they announce it in Facebook by writing on someone's wall or updating status etc. Now if I said I was going to Cancun for example would't it be great for advertisers of tshirts, shorts and holiday insurance to advertise to me? Only Facebook can do this, Google cannot (I would have to do three separate searches, with FB I do nothing).<p>I think this goes beyond a friend recommendation because it links exactly to my plans. Its not only targeted but it shows what I want tomorrow. I think overall this is more targeted than google thanks to the demographic targeting placed on top which Google does not have. In Facebook, I could use the persons place of employment and age to work out their salary and offer two different holiday insurance schemes to the wealthy and the less fortunate. If I type in Holiday insurance in Google, advertisers cannot filter like that. And would think this likely to return a better ROI than Google search (as long as people pay attention to the ads! - the assumption being when ads are relevant people actually do).<p>So what I am saying is that there is a whole lot of data for Facebook to play with, don't rule them out yet. It will be very hard for them to pull this off but someone has to challenge the google monopoly and who are better placed than them.",1210320307

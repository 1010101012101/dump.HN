Unless you account for everything on atomic level, you have all that uncertainty as random noise in you measured outcome. So indeed it <i>is</i> a random variable. Biased, yes, but random.<p>Actually, even if you can have data at atomic level you still have chaos theory and butterfly effect preventing you from making prediction. Then even some small fluctuation born by the Plank's ""uncertainty principle"" can grow up in time to big enough error.",1255945872

889780,comment,889348,889544,0,0,mahmud,,,"<i>map Japanese writing system to English</i><p><i>Don't</i> do that. As a polyglot, I recommend you stop transmapping languages; instead, learn each on it's own, mapping it only to your own mental <i>meaning</i>. Hard to explain, but it's better to learn grammar implicitly; remember the exceptions (e.g. irregular verbs) individually and whenever you need to conjugate a new verb, go with your gut feeling and see if it's similar to one of the common rules or one of the exceptions you have learned.<p>For acquiring vocabulary, learn the meaning of the word (internal mental meaning) and its dictionary description in the <i>new</i> language. You will be using the language itself to describe its vocabulary. That way, if you forget the word, you can rewrite the phrase in your mind and expand the description in-place (e.g. ""I need to call my father's brother"" is still a correct sentence, even if you forget the word ""uncle"".)<p>For newbie language learners, it's the single words that are hard to remember, since they might resemble other words, while descriptive phrases are easy to remember since they're long string sequences and whence easy to match in your head.<p>P.S. Also, if you have a buddy who speaks English (preferably very little of it) try to troll him by generating sentences and let him correct you. It's not as tiring to him as it might seem at first, most people are amused by bad grammar and you will be a town pub favorite. Absorb all the corrections and try to use them immediately, generating other similar sentences.",1255945657

889778,comment,889516,889762,0,0,10ren,,,"I was surprised to find that the lack of static types in python made the documentation less clear for me. I had to read through the documentation to get a grasp of what the formal parameters meant (e.g. were they strings, or more complex data structures), and with several parameters, I kept forgetting which was which. I think there are conventions that experienced python programmers would pick up (e.g. in the naming of parameters). but I didn't know them. Sort of, informal static typing, no?<p>In Java, the types of parameters give succinct guidance (though I hadn't appreciated this til I saw python docs). You can follow the hyperlinks to get the definitions.<p>In Haskell, people claim that its more expressive type-system enables you to quickly search for relevant functions, without knowing their names. (I can't verify this personally).<p>For me, it's very much an unexpected benefit of static type systems.<p>PS: I don't think Python users need the reassurance, but the actual library being explained by the docs was a <i>lot</i> simpler and easier to use than the equivalent in Java.",1255945504

889762,comment,889516,889516,0,0,dkersten,,,"Libraries are extremely important and the major resistance for me to learn more interesting languages (Eg, I wanted to start using a Lisp, but found their lack of extensive, well documented libraries to be a hindrance (I have since started using Clojure, which doesn't have this issue); also wanted to start using Factor for real projects and I needed libraries which it doesn't yet have and I don't have time to contribute..)<p>But I don't find Java to be as good as the article makes it out to be. The library, IMHO, is a mess and the javadoc documentation, while great most of the time, sometimes just doesn't explain what you need (like when I had to learn JAIN from the Javadoc alone...), personally, I find Pythons library just as extensive and better organised and designed. Seems that documentation is a matter of taste though - I really like Pythons docs. I find them clear, to the point and intuitive, but I've also heard people complain about them. I definitely do agree that libraries with good documentation are important.",1255943344
889761,comment,889516,889753,0,0,pavlov,,,"Sorry if my point was so unclear. I agree completely that examples are an integral part of documentation. But it sometimes seems that this point is lost on the programmers and tech writers who should be collaborating to produce the documentation (or perhaps management is to blame for treating these roles too separately).<p>The result is often documentation that's too verbose, too rigidly structured according to the implementation's hierarchies and doesn't match the thought processes and expectations of the target users.",1255943315

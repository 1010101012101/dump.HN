The writing style just pulls you through, and at the end you feel like you've learned something of significance.  It is a nice break from the more hectic style of reading I do online.  At least, that was my experience after reading his post on the properties pattern.",1225364010

I got over 600 spam messages to my primary address yesterday, and only 3 made it to my mailbox...and all I do is run SpamAssassin with almost entirely default settings and auto-white/black listing (which is Bayesian).  Now, the primary things that motivate me are making the system more efficient with regard to resource usage, rather than more effective (though being more effective is also good).  Some of our customers still seem to have problems, but I've not really figured out why SpamAssassin works so poorly for them and so well for me.",1225362200

As of right now you can already get tested for any number of genetic disorders... and you and your significant other can be tested before you have kids to see what sort of risks you may have. I just don't see why 23andMe is that different. Maybe someone can explain what makes it great?<p>Meanwhile the Tesla is beyond proof of concept. It's fast, handles well and can be recharged enough to make sense if you are commuting. It's a real contender for those that drive Porsches, BMWs, etc to work. Add in their future plans to create new models that are more affordable and roomy.<p>[EDIT Details!]",1225362124

We marry a lot later. This is one of the few cities in the world where it's not stigmatized to be over 30 and unmarried.<p>2. The housing situation is, indeed, shitty. It's not as bad as you say, with the condemnation to suburbs that you depict as inexorable, but having kids will accelerate the outright theft of your savings by the property-owning class.<p><i>There's a constant stream of urban liberal editorials/articles on red state teen pregnancies. I think it's because at some level liberals are freaked out about being out-bred by such a wide margin.</i><p>This ""constant stream"" of articles exists for a reason. Religious conservatives are trying to push their social model on us. We're pointing out that it doesn't work well even on its home turf. This isn't about ""chastising the hicks"". The victims of the red-state family breakdowns are, obviously, people in the red states.<p><i>This is why Palin and her family freaks out a lot of liberal women SOO badly. She's a stark reminder of their infertility.</i><p>Although I'm a man, I'll point out that Palin scares anyone with a brain. This has nothing to do with fertility. 1. She has an extremely narrow-minded view, which is completely inappropriate for someone running for high public office. 2. She stands for everything that is consumptive (""drill, baby, drill""), self-indulgent, mean-spirited, wrong and stupid about this country. 3. Although she was picked to rally middle-of-the-road women, she failed completely at that... but is great at stoking the lowest common denominator bottom-feeders, as the people who show up at Palin rallies (racists, paranoids) are loathsome.<p>New Yorkers don't despise people who choose to have large families. We despise those who do so irresponsibly, and we despise the very rich who have large families to show off (a Manhattan/Boston phenomenon) their means, such as Mitt Romney, because of their effect on housing prices... but we don't have a knee-jerk animosity toward people in general who choose to have four or five kids.",1225360857

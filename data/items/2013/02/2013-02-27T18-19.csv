WHY? What is the point? Why write a bordering absurd praise of a guy that is so infamous for his own admitted horrible things in the book?<p>If it was more realistic, I mean, praising the good and the calling out the bad is one thing, but I don't see this sort of treatment even with Steve Jobs (even very positive texts on Steve Jobs mention how he had bad temper and people feared to get fired by just being near him, or how he sometimes got stubborn with ideas that were not necessarily good ones).",1361991573
5294104,comment,5291602,5291724,5,0,pasbesoin,,,"Your words ""price discrimination"" jumped out at me.  Not so much to respond to your comment, but to post my own reaction, I'll briefly observe:<p>From a U.S. perspective (mine):  Increasingly (well, it's a long-standing practice, now), film and television production companies move production abroad to take advantage of lower production costs (labor, et al.).<p>At the same time, they <i>insist</i> that I not source my viewing material from abroad -- that I not take advantage of lower foreign costs for the distributed media.<p>Well, this is a loud and clear <i>fail</i>, from my perspective.  What gives them the right to access such advantages while denying the same to me?  And... by moving their production abroad, they reduce the work and -- supply and demand -- wage levels available in this country.<p>If they want to ""import"" cheaper labor, etc. into their production costs, I should be able to ""import"" the cheaper foreign distribution product.<p>Otherwise... I'm in the position of an increasing number in the U.S. who have simply decided, ""fuck them"".<p>It's amazing how ""free traders"" suddenly find all sorts of arguments to the contrary, when free trade threatens to cut into <i>their</i> bottom line.  Mostly, they're just another set of hypocrites.  Dangerous ones, from my U.S. perspective, because of the way they are increasingly screwing us over, economically.<p>I don't begrudge the rest of the world advancement.  I begrudge the self-serving in my own society who sell out a portion of their own population for their own personal benefit.  I -- and I think we all, here in the U.S. -- could do with a few less knicknacks in return for a more healthy level of social equity including particularly e.g. access to healthcare, good schools, and livable wages at reasonable quantities of work hours.<p>And maybe other societies could do with a bit less brain drain and a bit more balanced social development.  Less of us propping up foreign dictators past their and their regimes' natural lifespans.<p>I guess I've gone and gotten all non-technical on HN, here.  But... our technical decisions, such as production sourcing, are <i>directly</i> involved in this.<p>When companies can move their production around, but people stay stuck in place (and as often as not, under repressive regimes), you <i>do not</i> have ""free trade"".<p>The labor portion of the equation is <i>not</i> free.<p>P.S.  Sorry, that may have ended up a bit (or more) far afield from the original discussion.<p>(Continuing with the perspective) Even at the ""inflated"" U.S. prices I see, I tend to purchase materials I find good and where I am not overly offended at the funding model (as one example, I've been a long-time supporter of O'Reilly press and have <i>not</i> gone out pirating books).  But I'm damned well not going to be preached at by these hypocrites, any longer, nor by their hired guns who now think (I hope, still not entirely correctly) that they run this country.<p>I think the U.S. could do with an overall rousing, depression-lifting round of ""fuck them"".",1361991566

5294094,comment,5293606,5294005,5,0,rayiner,,,"> Honest question: can you point to some examples where such professional discipline lead to a meaningful impact on the plaintiff's firm (it would seem that attorneys are not so scarce that censuring one or two at a large firm would do much damage), or another kind of meaningful reform?<p>Large firms are repeat players with the court system. A sanction that's even nothing more than a note in a file is a scary thought when that firm will have to go in front of that same court in other cases day after day. For a large firm, it's not worth it to toe that line. That said, it still happens, e.g. <a href=""http://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/benchslap-of-the-day-judge-cooke-sanctions-greenberg-traurig-and-td-bank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/benchslap-of-the-day-judge-co...</a>.<p>The situation is somewhat different for other lawyers. A single sanaction for a frivolous suit is unlikely to get you disbarred. That said, the threat of disbarment isn't illusory: <a href=""http://www.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=DPQeNI9Fzlo%3D&tabid=224&mid=1534"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=DPQeNI9Fz...</a>. The California Bar disbarred or suspended 394 lawyers in 2011.<p>Note that sanctions can include financial penalties for both the lawyer and the client. To pick an example out of a hat: <a href=""http://valawyersweekly.com/2012/12/21/baseless-suit-nets-sanction-of-50k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valawyersweekly.com/2012/12/21/baseless-suit-nets-san...</a>. If a patent troll is bringing clearly frivolous suits, nothing stops a court from recognizing a pattern and imposing significant monetary sanctions. The problem is, the bar for ""frivolous suit"" is pretty high in order to avoid deterrming meritorious litigation.",1361991466

Now suppose they get a frantic call from a client who's not paying for backups, asking if they have any. How much of a ridiculous markup would Rackspace need to charge to give the client access this unpaid-for backup, in order to make the back-up-every-database policy profitable? I'm guessing this depends on 1) the frequency of frantic phone calls, 2) the average size of a database that they aren't being paid to back up, and 3) the importance and irreplacebility of the data that they're handling (and 4) the irresponsibility of their major clients).",1361991441

5294089,comment,5293845,5293845,14,0,untog,,,"EDIT: the title of this post has now been changed, to the extent that it loses its entire relevance to HN. It was previously something along the lines of ""After a year reading HN, this quote reminds me of the people here""<p>---<p>I'm deeply skeptical of any attempts to romanticise ""doing a startup"".<p><i>""The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood""</i><p>Running a startup is hard work. No-one disputes that. But if you are in the position to run your own startup you are <i>incredibly lucky</i>. There are a lot of people out there that might be far better entrepreneurs than you, but because they weren't born into a situation that gave them a good education and the ability to take a risk, they never will.<p>Running a startup is stressful, but don't try to pretend that there aren't enormous upsides. You can do whatever you want, you can work with whomever you want. The industry <i>celebrates failure</i>- think about that for a second. You can try your best, fail miserably, and people will still say that you did a good job. How many other people in the world can do that? The guy earning minimum wage in his factory job, spending all his salary just to keep out of poverty- if he fails, he is fired, and he and his family are screwed. He is the person whose face is much more likely to be covered in actual dust and sweat and blood.<p>Being in this industry is a position of extreme privilege. Harping on about it as if it's a heavy burden to bear is utter nonsense and only helps the perception of ""startup folk"" as deeply out of tune with how the rest of the world works.",1361991356

5294086,story,,,1,0,stelellico,"Computer repair westchester ny",http://www.pcdoctornewyork.com,"Games and learning programs are among the leading titles in retail software sales and they are mainly written in Visual Basic, as they need to be compatible with Microsoft OS. The games market has exploded as PC speeds have increased, and as output graphics have improved. However, on the
technical side, there is generally not much call for a repair associate with game software. Most games work with well-developed pointing devices, such as trackballs and joysticks, as the primary input devices. Although the housing designs of these products can be quite amazing, they tend to be simple and well-proven devices, requiring relatively little maintenance. Likewise, the software tends to be pretty straightforward from a users point of view. It simply gets installed and runs. Computer-aided instruction (CAI) and computer-based instruction (CBI) have become accepted means of delivering instructional materials. In CAI operations, the computer assists a human instructor in delivering information and tracking student responses.
In CBI operations, the computer becomes the primary delivery vehicle for instructional materials. As these teaching systems proliferate, more complex input, output and processing devices are added to the system. A basic teaching system requires a minimum of a sound card, a fast hard drive, a CD-ROM drive, and a high-resolution video card. Beyond this, CAI and CBI systems may employ such wide-ranging peripherals as large LCD display panels, VGA-compatible overhead projectors, intelligent white boards, wireless mice, and touch-sensitive screens as input devices, full-motion video capture cards, and a host of other multimedia related equipment.",1361991335

Looking at that I see we sometimes spike the max over 350mb.  The question is, what is that spike going to look like running unicorn.  Unfortunately, I can't think of many ways to accurately test/predict that without simply giving it a try.<p>One other thing that was mentioned in the comments of the article is that you can set the unicorn backlog to a very low number (default appears to be 1024) which will apparently tell the heroku router that a particular dyno is ""full"" and to look somewhere else to process the request. One comment recommends setting the backlog to 25.  I wonder what setting the backlog to something like #workers*2 would do.",1361990221

I would only find jobs via my reputation, connections, and by pitching the work that I thought needed to be done, and why I was the person to do it.

So the C++ is longer, but you've got braces, and the references to the Face and unsigned int pointIndex are placed as a local variables, which makes debugging much easier - they could be inlined.<p>It's possible to get that down even more using more modern C++ - using auto variables and not declaring the start iterator on it's own line.<p>So yes, counting braces, it can be a lot more lines, but if you don't count braces, it's generally not that much more.",1361989492

quick example from <a href=""https://github.com/BrentNoorda/FuncyTag#quick-example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BrentNoorda/FuncyTag#quick-example</a><p><pre><code>    t = div( { id:'animal-'+id, class:genus },

            'The', b('species'), 'is a', genus, 'and looks like this:',
            img( { width:imgSize, height:imgSize, src:'/pix/' + id + '.jpg' } )
          )
        );
</code></pre>
can be written in pure jQuery in a very similar fashion:<p><pre><code>    t = $('<div/>',{ id:'animal-'+id, class:genus }).append(
          $('<p/>').css({ color:endangered?'red':'green', fontSize:endangered?'120%':'' }).append(
            'The ', $('<b/>').text(species), ' is a ', genus, ' and looks like this:',
            $('<img/>',{ width:imgSize, height:imgSize, src:'/pix' + id + '.jpg' } )
          )
        );
</code></pre>
So I don't claim any tremendous FuncyTag breakthrough if you're accustomed to the jQuery style.<p>There's a few differences in FuncyTag that I've found work better for me:
 1) treating tags fully as functions means I can read it and write it easier
 2) set css/Styles the same as setting attributes (through cssCamelStyle), instead
    of using css() versus attr()
 3) setting the css units as part of the name (e.g. cssMarginLeft_em:2)
 4) creating html strings with indentation, so alert(t) helps me see the HTML when I'm debugging<p>I just find one of the above approaches easier to read than the other, and keep going
back to it so thought I'd finally document and share. (Maybe the FuncyTag approach is
easier, or maybe I'm just so familiar with it since that's how I've most enjoyed creating
HTML from javascript since about the mid 90's.)",1361989034

5293879,comment,5293606,5293804,23,0,rayiner,,,"You have to separate two scenarios: plaintiff brings a justifiable suit but loses, and plaintiff brings an unjustified suit. The latter is handled through professional discipline of the attorney's involved. The former is not really a scenario where the plaintiff is at fault.<p>Just because you lose a suit doesn't mean the suit was unjustified. You know all those plaintiffs suing the banks over mortgage related issues? Most of those plaintiffs are going to lose, because they can't back up their claims with sufficient proof or the banks skirted but stayed on the right side of the law, at least technically. Should those plaintiffs pay the banks punitive penalties for bringing suits they lost? Should they even have to pay the banks' legal fees?<p>It's easy to throw around ideas like loser-pays when you have a clearly established preconception of who the ""good guys"" and who the ""bad guys"" are. But that doesn't make for workable policy. Bankers/private equity folks, etc, really think they're the good guys and the people suing them are just bitter because they got the short end of a deal they knowingly got into. The folks that work in petro-chem really think they're the good guys, and folks suing them for environmental harms are just hypocrites who want all the advantages of modern petrochemcial processes (pretty much every gadget you own is the result of a horribly polluting process) but aren't willing to put up with the inevitable consequences. I'm sure they'd love loser pays too, for situations where some investor ends up not being able to prove outright fraud, or where some community can't muster the evidence to prove that a chemical plant caused kids to get cancer.<p>Loser-pays is just a band-aid on what is a more fundamental problem with the patent system: the law has evolved to make patents a strong right with very ill-defined boundaries. That makes litigation protracted and expensive because you end up getting into the weeds of technical issues and whether this kind of thing is like this other kind of thhing that the court system isn't really competent to deal with. No amount of tweeking at the edges is going to fix that. The solution is to make patent rights narrower and more well-deliniated. Shift the focus to questions like whether the defendant unfairly competed with plaintiff by copying the plaintiff's IP instead of innovating themselves. These are things the court system is competent to handle (and has been for hundreds of years). When it can be easily seen whether clearly-defined legal rights have been violated, frivolous litigation naturally diminishes because the cost to prove allegations wrong goes way down, which makes the incentive to just settle also",1361989022

The guise was to make it ""more metro"" despite Windows 8 not taking the same approach (like all caps).<p>The VS 2012 betas tried putting all caps on various parts of the UI. They got tons of pushback on that, so they eventually just made it the menu so they could still claim they kept the principle idea alive. In the final release, there's an option to turn it off.<p>A lot of VS devs are happy that they added a proper dark mode, and there's a plugin to autohide the menus so it's less of an issue that it appears at first. The biggest usability issue is the single-colour icons.<p>There's probably amazing internal threads and all sorts of political issues surrounding the design. In the end, I think the champions of the change count on wearing you down, making their opponents feel silly for arguing over such petty things as menu styles.",1361988711

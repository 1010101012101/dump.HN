There are usually a bunch of relatively easy classes, even among those numbered XXX -- a lot of these are intended for future high school teachers -- but there will also be some very serious ones.<p>In other words, the requirements for a degree are not a terribly useful yardstick (and when we evaluate grad applications we expect people to have gone beyond the minimum, even at my not-terribly-prestigious university). I recommend talking to a professor if at all possible, face to face, who has some research interests in common with your background and interests, and can suggest a course of study suitable for you in particular.<p>Good luck!

Having the government do the inexpensive part -- the research -- does not eliminate the extremely expensive development. Almost all the cost of new pharmaceuticals is in the development phase. Government funding research is a drop in the bucket after private companies fund the clinical trials.<p>While government has an okay track record funding research, they have a pretty poor track record funding development, hence why it is left to private companies. This has to do with the way governments legally structure funding combined with the fact that development cycles are much longer than political cycles. In areas where the government does fund development, the development is interrupted by constantly shifting funding priorities and politicians trying to redirect money to their districts or constituents in the middle of development. This tends to make things cost (at least) twice as much and take (at least) twice as long as they would in environments where the development cycle is guaranteed to be uninterrupted and free from the whims of whoever is elected this year.",1343004665

4279034,comment,4277802,4278909,2,0,srean,,,"Though I love weave myself, it does not get much love in the numpy community. There you would be discouraged from using weave and strongly nudged towards Cython.<p>The weave source hasnt seen development since ages, whereas Blitz++, the C++ array library that it is based upon has moved on quite a bit. Blitz++ has added SIMD support, or rather restructured its code so that the compilers find it easy to vectorize. The new version of Blitz++ holds its own against ifortran in terms of vectorization. These are some of the advantages that you could have enjoyed had weave been kept uptodate. I dont blame the numpy community for this though, though Blitz++ sees continuous development there has not been any formal release in tens of years. So it does become difficult to incorporate such a library. But I dont think that is the main reason why weave has languished.<p>I am sure Cython is great, but what I like about weave is the syntactic sugar that it brings. I do not have to write raw loops or do pointer arithmetic. If you want this kind of syntactic sugar in Cython now, you call back into the numpy API. If the default API does not give you the speed that you want, you have to expose the raw pointers of the arrays and to the messy pointer arithmetic and operations yourself. Nothing wrong with that, just that it can be error prone.<p>Cython however has other good things going for it, for instance it allows easy coordination with OpenMP, so it is easy to parallelize array updates, without incurring the multiple processes overhead.",1343004207

It was surprising just how much her ability to reason degraded.<p>Reasoning depends heavily upon <i>emotional</i> responses like feeling uncomfortable, surprised, curious, or frustrated by the data / facts / information.  One with reduced emotions becomes disinterested; they simply stop <i>caring</i> about understanding.  They stop <i>caring</i> enough to work through difficult problems.  They don't <i>care</i> enough to search for better data or better ideas.<p>I would agree that it's unhealthy to be guided by emotion in the sense of ""I feel this is true"" or ""I believe this because I want to"".  This sort of emotion is mostly a distraction from rationality.  But it's entirely healthy to be guided by emotion in the sense of ""I care about getting this right"" or ""I'm bothered by these details not fitting"".  Without that sort of emotion to push you into rationality, you end up settling for weak, halfhearted, and ultimately irrational explanations.",1343004117

Digital displays are horrible for indicating first and second derivatives; analog dials are great for first and adequate for second.<p>The best UI on a car I've seen (as far as actually driving it) is the Audi -- a Driver Information Display directly in line with the driver (showing next turn), and a center area.  There's a reason for going for all-red indicators -- night vision.  In rural areas, you often dial down the brightness of all controls to preserve night vision in case an animal or debris is in the road.  If you're on I-5 driving from Seattle to SF, there aren't a whole lot of turns, so your nav system is really secondary (if on at all), and there's no reason for it to be in your line of sight.<p>For great designed interiors for drivers, I'd look to Audi, Porsche, and go from there.<p>When driving, I'd consider audio nav information to be primary, followed by simple next turn information, followed by a (north-centric, vs. vehicle bearing) map.  95% of the time the only nav info I need is ""left turn in 200 meters, 100 meters, 50 meters, now"", since I'm focused on other cars rather than my display.  It's only with complex intersections (roundabouts, 5-6 way intersections where grids overlap, etc.) that I need to see the display.<p>Audio is inherently more minimal than visual information, so a car really needs to get it right.  Simple things like the order of words in notifications, how frequently they happen, tones vs. words, etc. make a huge difference, and require design vs. advanced graphics to get right.",1343003465

Being on the council means that they can have weapons, but agree to use them responsibly, and their adherence to the treaty means that they can verify the safety of their devices, that they are adhering to the treaty's requirements on inspection by the IAEA, and that they are abiding all disarmament requirements specified therein.<p>India and Pakistan, having not ever accepted the treaty in the first place, are in a different position.  Their nukes are treated with skepticism naturally, but they haven't ever agreed to anything so are exempt from its guidelines.<p>North Korea is a unique case, in that it did sign the treaty, but later withdrew its acceptance and are now, as you say, 'posturing', after never having come into compliance when they were abiding the treaty and having acceded.  That there are questions as to their governmental leadership, and that they are testing nuclear devices in secret only exacerbates that, at the very least, we need to keep our eyes on what they are doing.",1343003005

4278932,comment,4278298,4278700,1,0,kyro,,,"I think that works in theory, but you have to look at what will draw users to care about applications. If the network effects aren't there, there's no reason why a user would be drawn to using a given application if the underlying service just isn't worth it. Users have a high tolerance for bad design and I think not paying for a Twitter that displays ads is well within that range of tolerance with the current Twitter app offerings.<p>You'd have to not charge users to get the network effects to kick in, but at that point, you're just a more open Twitter clone and you'll have to scramble to find a revenue source eventually.",1343001943

It's easier than ever to get games in the hands of eager/bored people via mobile and Facebook, and companies are thus capitalizing on these users by building shallow experiences while optimizing for revenues <i>instead of</i> fun.<p>Additionally, I think more game devs need to speak out against the ""evil"" design. I hear a lot of tech-savvy people talking about this stuff verbally, but is the common person really aware of the amount of time that is spent trying to engineer them into being addicted? I realize that as developers, we don't necessarily benefit from spending a lot more time building something just to end up making less money, but the line needs to be drawn somewhere.",1343001876

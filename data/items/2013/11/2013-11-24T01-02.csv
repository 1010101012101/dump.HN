I went all out maintaining a minute by minute lifelog (<a href=\"http://david.achkar.com/life-log/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://david.achkar.com/life-log/</a>), and one takeaway that&#x27;s useful to mention here is that intuition about how I spent my time was often way off (vs what my data showed).

And, if having the world&#x27;s largest investment banks as loyal clients is any indication, his code is high quality.  Anyway, I consider the code high quality.<p>Now, I cannot prove that LOC is related to quality, but I know several programmers whose software I like very much who have a keen appreciation for brevity.

But I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s too early to reach a conclusion like that. It&#x27;s not unusual for mainstream philosophical ideas of X&#x27;th century to have little impact on the real world until well into X+1&#x27;th century or even later, and that&#x27;s under favorable socioeconomic circumstances.<p>Similarly, programming language theory debated on the Haskell lists tends to &quot;trickle down&quot;, after a while, into various other languages and frameworks. 10 or 20 or 30 years later, someone writes a PHP framework that is indirectly inspired by some of them. It takes time, that&#x27;s all.<p>I&#x27;d be very surprised if political ideas developed in the 1990s, for example, came to fruition anytime before 2090 or so. And the same applies to the neoreactionary ideas of the 2000s. Even if they&#x27;re as promising as their advocates say they are, it&#x27;s going to take no less time to port them to the real world.

College, work, house-sharing, school (one who I met over 20 years ago) Though I have gone to college twice and worked in many many jobs.<p>The most recent intense-friend I made was at a college halloween party the year before last. I&#x27;m am generally not into wasting time with people but when I do socialise I like to go to house parties and whatnot.<p>I reckon for me to find one of these special people who I click with is just a statistical probability, I might find one every few 1000 people I meet, so it makes sense to go to events and meet as many people as possible. I was actually going to suggest any big event where you and everyone else are likely to be drunk is a great way to meet lots of people.<p>Also its handy if one of my good friends is also really generally sociable, then I will meet people/find out about parties and stuff through them.<p>They do suffer a slight attrition rate as, for example, a few have moved to different countries for work.\nThe cool thing is if one had been gone for years when we do  meet up again it is like no time has passed.<p>I have 2 in the city I live in atm.

But let&#x27;s not get into an economics argument here.<p>You are confusing ethical argument with an economical one. I was talking economics, not ethics. Governments get a lot of power from ability to print money and censor transactions. Bitcoin removes these sources of power to a high degree regardless of whether it&#x27;s good or bad. Like, when the internet got huge, moral question of whether people should be exposed to &quot;evil books&quot; or not becomes irrelevant. If one wants to read a book you think is not appropriate, he will do so anyway.<p>Governments printing ASICs to spam the network... That&#x27;s the most expensive way to attack Bitcoin. If anyone ever gets to it, it simply means that BTC is already established in many places and widely used and very valuable. Governments would love to extract that BTC for their spendings instead of killing it. Like it happened with gold: in theory, gold is superior to printed fiat currency, but it isn&#x27;t killed, it&#x27;s confiscated and used as a hard currency among those who can afford keeping it secure: governments and banks, not you and me.",1385254881

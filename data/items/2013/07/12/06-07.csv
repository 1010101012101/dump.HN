A formula that predicts to many decimal places over a fair period, prospectively, would be really weird but hard to ignore.<p>Spanish debt, gold prices or something related on the other hand, would require proportionately less evidence for causation.<p>This disturbs people because it implies you can get stuck in a pathological view of the world and statistics and evidence won&#x27;t get you out. Sorry about that.<p>Edit: And this is pretty the Bayesian Approach. It&#x27;s just that Bayesian Statistics and Pearl arguments, are themselves just models of the world. You can have others but, even more, you need more of an arguments than &quot;stuff that seems implausible needs more evidence&quot; and all of the more elaborate stuff is going to be specific to a given situation and thus might be applicable to a different one.",1373612363

More details at <a href=""http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201212"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201212</a>.<p>Perl 5, perhaps surprisingly, is not simpler:<p><pre><code>    perl -wle &#x27;local $/; $_ = <>; $, = &quot; &quot;; $w{$_}++ for split; print @{[sort {$w{$b} <=> $w{$a}} keys %w]}[0..9]&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nAnd neither is this, although it uses less code and less RAM:<p><pre><code>    perl -wlne &#x27;$w{$_}++ for split; END { $, = &quot; &quot;; print @{[sort {$w{$b} <=> $w{$a}} keys %w]}[0..9]}&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI was surprised, attempting to solve this in Common Lisp, that there&#x27;s no equivalent of string/split in ANSI Common Lisp, and although SPLIT-SEQUENCE is standardized, it&#x27;s not included in SBCL&#x27;s default install, at least on Debian; and counting the duplicate words involves an explicit loop.  So basically in unvarnished CL you end up doing more or less what you&#x27;d do in C, but without writing your own hash table.  Lua and Scheme too, I think, except that in Scheme you don&#x27;t even have hash tables.",1373611806

The Canadian dollar hasn&#x27;t been  as low as .69 (mentioned in article) since at least late-2003, as far back as yahoo/google finance go. The latest references are 1999.<p>I&#x27;m also going to disagree with what the author says. I go to an ivy-league school, and there are two things that make all the difference: the caliber of students, and the atmosphere of hard work. Of course there are smart people at every school, as Author writes in describing Honors programs. But the concentration is just incredibly high at Ivys. Any random person you run into or work with is most likely brilliant in some way or other.<p>Atmosphere of hard work - Being surrounded by many high-achievers, you just can&#x27;t help but push yourself to work harder, achieve more, etc. As long as you&#x27;re in touch with yourself to avoid burnout, I love this atmosphere because it pushes me to accomplish more than I would were I surrounded by a bunch of people who just want to drink all day every day (of course there are those students, but they&#x27;re in the minority.)<p>That&#x27;s not to say an Ivy is always worth it.

A number of business schools do this already in the selection process. If you run a gun school and a student comes to you to tell you he is using your training to rob a bank, it would be unethical to teach him. If you are doing training on hacking and you know the student will use this hacking for unethical and illegal wiretapping, it would be unethical to teach him. Again, it is fine to discriminate on what someone is doing.<p>Future employers? If the candidate is locked into the path - eg, he will use your training to rob a bank, then it would be unethical to teach him. However, as he has not done it yet, and people can change their minds, it would likely be ethical to teach him while also steering him towards the correct path. Ethical or not would depend on three factors: how likely you are to sway him; how much damage he would cause if you could not; and how easy it would be for him to find the training elsewhere, where he would likely not benefit at all from steering.<p>Past employers? This one is, unfortunately, much harder. If someone is a murderer and has not gone to jail, should you discriminate? If someone is a murderer and has gone to jail but is not repentant, should you discriminate? If he is repentant, should you discriminate? This one is difficult because it crosses the line of &#x27;who one is&#x27; and &#x27;what one does&#x27;. I&#x27;d say everyone will give different answers here based on a huge number of factors. It likely comes down to repentance and acknowledgment on whether what one does was wrong and believable agreement that it will not be done again.",1373610606

For example the crime of &#x27;disruption of public order&#x27; could be used to put basically anybody to jail because the term would be twisted to fit any behaviour that the regime did not like - for example when you criticised some official or communist party member or complained about something publicly.<p>Actually I believe that ability of the government or any other group of people to redefine common language and inability of people to force government to use their version of language means that the power distribution in society is seriously skewed and therefore is a strong sign of failing democracy.

These are a very well-known type of scientific investigation, particularly among the tech crowd--because it is tech-intensive to manage and analyze large volumes of data.<p>But, epidemiology is not all of science, it&#x27;s just one way to do science. So this statement is wrong, or, at least, not complete:<p>> The standard scientific answer to this question is that (with some caveats) we can infer causality from a well designed randomized controlled experiment.<p>The more general scientific answer is that we need an hypothesis that can be tested and disproven by observation. Such observations can come from a randomized controlled trial, but a surprising amount of important scientific observations do not. For example, a major confirming test of relativity was to measure the apparent displacement of stars due to gravitational lensing during an eclipse. Obviously there is no way to create a random double blind study of this. (Unless one were to stare too long without eye protection! [rimshot])<p>But wait, I could hypothesize that saying &quot;blutarski&quot; when flipping a coin will make it land heads up, and if I only do the observation once, my stupid hypothesis might get confirmed. Right?<p>In this case, yes, a lengthy trial would help provide much better observations. But the more general answer is that a reasonable hypothesis must propose a physical system that could plausibly cause the predicted result. There is no known physical system that connects &quot;blutarski&quot; with coins, or Facebook traffic with Greek bonds. But there is a plausible physical mechanism by which smoke inhalation could lead to lung cancer.<p>This is what scientists are talking about when they say things like &quot;there&#x27;s more to science than curve-fitting.&quot; But most people do not understand the difference, and that&#x27;s why we see things like global climate circulation models get mixed up with historical climate reconstruction, or paleontology get mixed up with evolutionary biology.",1373610124

This is due to Simpson&#x27;s paradox[1], which says that correlation can be inverted when you take into account an additional distinguishing factor in your data.<p>A specific example.  Look at [2] and take the &quot;y&quot; axis to be &quot;cigarettes per day&quot; and the &quot;x&quot; axis to be &quot;life expectancy in years&quot;.  The overall trend is that more cigarettes leads to a shorter life.  However, if we find that the blue group are people who do not inhale, and the red group are people who do inhale, the correlation is reversed for all smokers -- smoking more leads to a longer life.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson&#x27;s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson&#x27;s_paradox</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simpson%27s_paradox_continuous.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simpson%27s_paradox_conti...</a>",1373609316

I&#x27;m so glad of that, even if I&#x27;m more or less on the opposite side of ADHD when it comes to focus and behaviour.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not denying that ADHD is a thing. However, it seems that in the USA it&#x27;s heavily overdiagnosed, and even worse, the educational system seems to be especially harmful to people with actual ADHD (some people argue that it&#x27;s because of that system being focused on certain skills, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so different here). It seems like some kind of ADHD-phobia that pushes schools to find a huge problem whenever any faint symptom is found, immediately resorting to medication and severely punishing those who don&#x27;t comply.",1373609083

If you are middle class, say earning $80k per year, I doubt you will pay more than ~$8k a year for your child to go to Harvard. The article does not address this, and explicitly says you should not consider these if you learn less than $40k (yet you pay nothing at Harvard if you earn less than $60k, I believe).",1373609074

There are people out there building human carrying scaled-up hobby quadcopters (well, hexa or duodec or hexadec copters).<p>I suspect there are (other) people out there now thinking things along the lines on &quot;Hmmm, made from balsa and foam covered in poly film, prepreg carbon tube, kevlar tow, epoxy and cyano. All pretty common high-end but regularly homebuilt model plane techniques. 10m long rotor blades are big - but only 2 or 3 times longer than pretty common competition rc glider wings. There&#x27;s a very reasonable chance that the right group of comp rc glider builders and quad rotor hobbyists could build something that weighs maybe only twice what this does, and has 5 or 10 times as much power available - probably for a budget of not much more that $10k.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;hardcore hobbyists&quot; will be pedaling one of these anytime soon, but flying something similar electrically is certainly not an impossibility.",1373608991

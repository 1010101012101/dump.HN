The same is apparently (according to John Taylor Gatto, writing in The Underground History of American Education) true of the Amish today.  Are the Amish just that gifted with genes for entrepreneurialism?  I think not.  It's merely conventional, and a recent convention at that, to work for a Faceless Big Company by default, as pg points out in his essay ""You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss.""",1226966235

However, for the past couple weeks I've been pouring myself into the OO textbooks, yet I still don't feel reassured in it's value. So, as of today I can speak OO, since I know all the jargon, but I still can't muster up the courage to write an application that seems practical to me, which is where my problem lies. I'm also no software-engineer, but I've come to face the facts that my vision of building tools/programs/output is flat; so please, inspire me with your wisdom from 30,000 feet above, metaphors, philosophy, and expression by comparison is welcome.<p>EDIT: I guess the origin of my writers block in doing something in OO is that I don't really feel like I'm handling <i>real</i> data.

Commercial Grade?<p>What does your external server do?<p>To be honest, I'd keep it dead simple, especially if you are using home grade stuff like linksys. Switches don't do DHCP, but routers can. Think of switches basically as giant line splitters.<p>Your front door is the wireless router - firewall on (assuming it's a full router, not just an AP), DCHP with your DMZ behind that, use 192.168.1.1 or whatever, and then your internal router is 192.168.1.2 on this network.<p>Second firewall/router to your internal network, DHCP on. You can actually use the same addys as the other network, but it may make sense to use different ranges. Switch behind here if you need it.<p>Ports open on both firewalls as required. That's how you see your DMZ server. (Don't use the ""DMZ host"" crap on the routers if it has such a thing, you're setting up a real DMZ manually.)<p>All wireless access should receive a different (untrusted  in your DMZ) range from the first DHCP.<p>If you can't see the internal server from a laptop with wireless, you're doing thing right. If you can, you are open.<p>Under no circumstances should you allow wireless internet access to be granted access to your internal network without VPN.<p>>>>>>>>>>>>>><p>The really simple way though is just to use the wired router with every port closed and expose as required. Throw the Wireless router outside of that with the internet attached to it. It depends though on what that external server is doing.

If I'm performing some system maintenance or deep system work or related programming, I find that techno/dance/trance helps... specifically soundtracks to some of my favorite movies that had techno in them are great for getting the draining mood effect that system programming can sometimes have on me.  Miami Vice soundtrack has some great tracks that when listening keeps me feeling like I'm /solving a problem/ when I'm deep into the mix... Hackers, the movie soundtrack, is another good one that I like; Swordfish is another good one.<p>When it comes to creativity and problem solving at the development level, I find that like others here, either no music or classical music on low volume assists the concentration.  Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart, etc.  I truly find classical helpful... I read once that it actually stimulates the proper receptors in the brain that involve critical thinking, but I'm unable to find that link as a source.

First, some of those &quot;many things&quot; would need to have a metabolism that&#x27;s close to ours. Secondly, even if those unaffected organisms are similar to us, we would need to consume that molecule at similar concentrations. Most toxins have adverse effect only beyond a certain dosage. Something can be harmless (like cyanide) in it&#x27;s &quot;naturally occurring&quot; concentrations, and positively lethal in higher doses. Besides, synthetic molecules are tested before they&#x27;re approved for human consumption, and they are usually tested on animals with similar metabolism to us, <i>and at the appropriate dose</i>.

These numbers don&#x27;t do anything, they don&#x27;t change anything, and they certainly won&#x27;t build a treehouse I can go hide in when my parents get overbearing and obsessively controlling.<p>However... my day job consists of managing an entire Enterprise Resource Planning system, and the numbers I put in the right place are the resources of this company.

The wrong numbers... well, 2+ year late deliveries and 2-million-dollar penalties are called &quot;getting off easy&quot; here.<p>So you see, your idea of what is imagination and useless, and what is &quot;real world&quot; and practical, definitely isn&#x27;t relevant to the problem. The real question here is: Comparing between a childhood with minecraft, and a childhood without minecraft, which childhood will produce the more happy and productive and overall enriched humans later?

People without that combination will have a much lower chance.<p>The good news for you and your son is that because they have identified multi-gene effects, the odds of you or your son having all the same SNPs as your sister is very low. You and your sister share half your DNA, so if there are ten genes involved, each with a 50/50 chance of being shared, that&#x27;s a 1 in 1024 chance (2^10).

This model has proven useful.<p>The model is clinically useful, but the assumption (which the DSM does not itself advertise or support, which is made implicitly when its categories are used as the basis for research) that the diagnostic categories in the DSM represent commonality in origin is an impediment to research.<p>While many people have overstated the NIMH move away from DSM categories as a basis for research funding as something like an indictment of the DSM in its intended role or, even more hyperbolicly, a rejection of psychiatry as a field, it <i>is</i> an important move that recognize that the DSM categories&#x27; utility in their intended purpose does not imply that they represent real commonality.",1410807660

I thought molecules are molecules, and don&#x27;t care how they came to be. What if humans were to artificially select some bacteria over a few generations to synthesize a certain molecule. Would that molecule now be &quot;natural&quot; or synthetic? In fact, it can be argued that many &quot;natural&quot; molecules are a result of that exact process, because their synthesizing organism has evolved to survive human effects.<p>EDIT: as pointed out by localhost, <i>natural products chemistry</i> is actually a well defined -- and widely accepted -- term.",1410807655

In other words, if something like that happens, you get zero assistance, not even from any health insurance you already have.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand the propensity of some to demean &quot;hey, there&#x27;s a serious immediate problem, let&#x27;s do everything we can to help&quot; with &quot;but it might (with minuscule odds) go horribly wrong! therefore we can&#x27;t let anyone do anything that&#x27;s not established best-condition status quo!&quot; With that mindset, it&#x27;s a wonder such people ever drive to work (you might die in a horrible flaming carbecue!).<p>Short answer : because it&#x27;s happened before.<p>I would also argue that given history, the risks of unknown treatments having major side effects are significant (let&#x27;s say ~15-20%). The risks of major side effects on pregnancies and later offspring are even more significant (20-40%).<p>So those odds are not that minuscule and there are going to be victims.<p>Your attitude stems from the idea that seems to be propagated a lot these days : that science and therefore medicine can fix anything, any disease. That was almost true for a short period at the end of the 70s. In the 80s we found several diseases became fully resistant. Now the counter of completely incurable diseases is in the thirties, and rising fast. Old, well-known diseases are coming back, untreatable. Tuberculosis, pneumonia, dysentery ... all have MRSA variants. And that&#x27;s ignoring a lot of viruses. Rabies, HIV, Hep C, MERS, Avian flu, Pig flu, ... all of which are essentially untreatable.<p>The point the CDC has been making for ~20 years now is that ~3 decades ago &quot;net-&quot;scientific advancement against infectious diseases stopped. There were advances, but diseases advanced at roughly the same pace. 2 decades ago we started losing ground and in the last decade we&#x27;ve been losing ground like never before.<p>And of course we&#x27;re completely focusing on the wrong solution : don&#x27;t use medicine anymore ! Great, but that ship has sailed, adaptation has happened and it&#x27;s generally too late. There have been studies on how long these adaptations last, and how long we&#x27;d have to wait if we stopped treating ill people. The timeframe is in the centuries.",1410807642

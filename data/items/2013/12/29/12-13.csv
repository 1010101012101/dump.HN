Yep, porn is actually that dangerous.<p>I might not care for the traditional &#x27;don&#x27;t watch porn because it is porn&#x27;/&#x27;think of the children&#x27;/&#x27;porn exploits women&#x27; arguments, however, I do have enlightened self interest and loss of libido is so not what I want to have.<p>If I was in the UK government I would want to get this message out to kids in schools, not to scare them away from porn for the sake of it, but because they deserve to have &#x27;normal&#x27;, happy sexual health. By censoring porn they are not going to get this message, in fact they will be further away from it than they are now, doing what they can to get the &#x27;forbidden fruit&#x27; instead of knowing why they just should not bother.<p>Instead of censoring they could have demanded that there be a banner on the pages of porn sites warning that use of porn leads to erectile dysfunction. This would be a proactive move, no harder to get into law than that stupid &#x27;this site uses cookies&#x27; directive. They could get the ISPs to do it so porn from outer Mongolia would be suitably warned of too.<p>We have had a block on mobiles in the UK for some time now. There were no riots in the streets because of this, people are fine with it. The ISPs can take the block off for people and the system just works. This new move is an extension of what we already have, not some Orwell-nightmare-slippery slope thing. The politicians will get their votes, some people will grumble but that will be it.",1388321460

Although it&#x27;s great in many ways, there are several challenges.<p>As you have noted, the lack of an external structure is a big one. Here&#x27;s what I do...<p>First, I map out a long-term timeline, which is generally a season (spring, summer, autumn, winter). I identify goals, objectives, events, etc., and map them out in a simple open source PM software package.<p>Second, each week -- usually late Friday afternoon or Saturday -- I take the broad project plan stuff and create a more detailed plan for the next week.<p>Finally, at the end of each day I write a very detailed list of things I am going to do the next day. This includes work stuff, but also anything else: chores, exercise, etc.<p>When I get up in the morning, I look at my list for that day, and tackle it. Round about 5:00 pm I review the list and make the next day&#x27;s list, and at 5:30 I treat myself to a Manhattan and some good music. Then it&#x27;s dinner and whatever.<p>I also journal my work-related stuff in iPython notebook, and I keep an accounting of my hours in an Excel spreadsheet.<p>All that keeps me focused.<p>It&#x27;s also important to provide yourself some relief. When you first start working like this, you realize how much time is spent at a normal work place not really working. In a normal work place there are meetings, water cooler chats, and so on. So it&#x27;s important not to think that you must be productive for eight solid hours a day, because in most work environments you aren&#x27;t. I plan on some reduced amount of productive time, and factor in what I call buffer time. After, say, 90 straight minutes of work, I might take a 10 - 15 minute walk around the neighborhood just to clear my mind and get my blood flowing.<p>That&#x27;s what works for me.<p>TL;DR: Make a detailed daily list of things to do, and do them.

Defining extension methods (with the new implicit class construct) is just syntactic sugar over implicit conversions.<p>Also, I find implicit parameters in general to be awesome. Because of implicit parameters, Scala achieves the best marriage available between OOP and FP. Scala doesn&#x27;t just pretend to be FP. Scala is FP. Think of languages like Ocaml or F#, which have 2 type-systems in the same language.<p>Scala also doesn&#x27;t side-step covariance/contravariance problems when dealing with generics, like other OOP languages do, providing the tools to deal with both. And we could agree that covariance/contravariance is a problem created by OOP subtyping, but if you&#x27;ve got OOP in the language, then you can&#x27;t really pretend that all generic types are covariant or invariant and it&#x27;s just awful to have two type systems in the same language.<p>> <i>but ugly stuff that is there only for compatibility reasons can always be put into the standard library rather than the core language</i><p>That&#x27;s what they are trying to do with SIP-18.

Scala 2.11 went through a compiler refactoring phase, badly needed as the compiler&#x27;s internals are messy, the plan being to make it more modular. Things are progressing in the right direction ... if only they got rid of the implicit conversions defined in Predef (and thus imported implicitly everywhere).",1388320058

What has changed besides the increase facebook usage?<p>On the one hand I tend to believe (as others have remarked) that usually the explanation for such a change is simpler than we&#x27;re inclined to think. It could just be that over time your interests diverged, for example. Or that your friend is just growing older and valuing conversation in itself over conversation as a way of exchanging ideas (similar perhaps to my observation that many people around me grow less ideologically-driven as they get older). I&#x27;ve seen this happen with some of my friends, and it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time observing people around me talk and interact with computers/social media, trying to see patterns emerge, and my observations fit your experience.<p>An example: for a few years I was a reddit-addict, and would spend hours just clicking on gifs, short videos, reading funny comments, and generally consuming that kind of short-attention-span content. So did my younger brother. And I noticed that many of our conversations would turn into &#x27;did you read this&#x27;, &#x27;haha, yes&#x27;, &#x27;oh and look at this&#x27; type of stuff. It reached a point where we weren&#x27;t just sharing trivial content, but mostly just comparing what trivial content we were both aware of (which created a sense of togetherness, I suppose).<p>Since then, I moved on to slightly more &#x27;heavy&#x27; content (partly through HN), and my brother curbed his reddit use. Our conversations now our much more meaningful and we often have multi-part conversations that span months on a single topic.<p>My youngest brother, on the other hand, is firmly in the reddit/9gag area, and I often notice a discrepancy in conversation between the three of us. For me and my other brother, even a silly meme can be the starting point of some kind of analysis, however inane, and we linger on the issue, whereas my younger brother has a tendency to move straight on to the next inane-but-entertaining thing. This sometimes causes a bit of awkwardness in the conversation as we seem to have different purposes.<p>While part of my is, as said earlier, inclined to believe that the explanation might be different or simpler (personality, for example, or age), the fact that I&#x27;ve seen our individual behavior correlate strongly to our media use, at different ages, and regardless of our rather distinct personalities, leads me to think that perhaps media use <i>is</i> a huge factor.",1388318758

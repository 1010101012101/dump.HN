In the process of applying the decorator, it adds the route to the dictionary. That&#x27;s also on module import.",1419832773

But because it didn&#x27;t do well in its initial release window, the longer-term popularity isn&#x27;t reflected by its financial performance. Piracy is a real problem for films that depend on long-tail revenue, which is one reason you see so many franchise films and aesthetically conservative genre pics - they&#x27;re an easier sell even though they don&#x27;t necessarily age well.",1419832122

But there is a huge difference between inciting revolutions that are beneficial to the US in foreign countries, one of the stated purposes of the intelligence community, and &quot;shilling&quot; comments on hackernews or reddit. Covert US involvement in swaying public opinion against opposing ideologies is a proud tradition that goes back to at least the 1930s and beyond. Using social media is just an extension of that. Most of the sources you provided are about creating fake social media sites to be used in foreign countries or broad discussions about psychological influence techniques that mention social media. There are no detailed plans that mention hackernews, reddit or any other online social news aggregator. It would be incredibly costly for the NSA to have agents posting pro-government comments on every thread that pops up on the hundreds of online tech communities and  I don&#x27;t see how they would benefit from it in any way.

This meant a family of unified interfaces that could be used across many device form factors, including desktop, laptop, tablet, smart phones and TV.

There’s the expression &quot;别在孔子面前卖文章” roughly &quot;Don&#x27;t sell your essay in front of Confucius” akin to our &quot;Don&#x27;t try to teach your Grandma to suck eggs”. Coming up with something new- or imagining you can carries a certain air of arrogance to it. This does not let itself to encouraging creativity. While this attitude has obviously led to accusations of China just cloning products, it’s also made many Chinese to be enthusiastic proponents of Open Source (although not contributors for the above reasons). So new solutions and creative problem solving will likely be something they rely on foreigners and overseas educated Chinese to do for some time.<p>Software, UI/UX, marketing and outsourcing are still comparatively weak.

Zero debt really doesn&#x27;t make sense as a goal, and this British bond repayment illustrates the case that if all goes well, inflation eventually reduces a constant debt to irrelevance.

That&#x27;s just how the deep state sells it to voters.<p>If you look at the Snowden documents (and leaks by others) you&#x27;ll see essentially nothing other than the international nature of the programs. For example, you&#x27;ll remember from the Snowden leaks that the NSA hacked the Brazilian oil company PETROBRAS to help American oil companies win offshore oil drilling locations. The hacking of Merkle&#x27;s cell phone was a big deal because it revealed that the US had information from Germany _during the Eurozone crisis_! Stuxnet was used to destroy Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.
The US also faces the same sort of pressure from other countries. This year alone the DoD was hacked, Wall Street, NASDAQ and JP Morgan were hacked and hundreds of defense contractors were hacked - all with foreign attribution. Israel&#x27;s Iron Dome designs were hacked by China.<p>Take a look at the NSA program HACIENTA, which &quot;is used to port scan entire countries&quot; and which uses other compromised (civilian) computers to disguise attribution.<p>Look at The Intercept reporting (where Glenn Greenwald is right now). He speaks at length about how the US uses NSA operations to benefit the global bargaining posture and competitiveness of US companies. <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments-plans-use-economic-espionage-benefit-american-corporations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments...</a><p>And take the Inspector General&#x27;s report from the Boston Bombings - a great example of how and when the NSA domestic programs would be used if they were about terrorism. The NSA is hardly mentioned. The Inspector General investigates the failings of the FBI. (<a href=""http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport...</a>)<p>&quot;We focused our review on the entities that were the most likely to have had information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev prior to the bombings – the FBI, the CIA, DHS, and NCTC, which maintains the U.S. government’s database of classified identifying and substantive derogatory information on known or suspected terrorists. We also requested other federal agencies to identify relevant information they may have had prior to the bombings. These agencies included the Department of Defense (including the National Security Agency (NSA)), Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Department of Energy, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot;<p>The report on the failures to anticipate/stop the Boston Bombers barely mention the NSA. This is because the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center are in charge of counterterrorism, not the National Security Agency.<p>Or go to the NSA&#x27;s own mission statement. (<a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml</a>)<p>&quot;The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) leads the U.S. Government in cryptology that encompasses both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA) products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.&quot;<p>(Nothing to do with terrorism.)<p>Lots of news recently has called out Executive Order 12333&#x27;s role in defining the goal and the means of intelligence capabilities. EO 12333 was passed in 1981. The Five Eyes, the key partnership of the NSA, has its origins in the 40&#x27;s and ECHELON and other leaked programs (eg CARNIVORE/PREDATOR) predate 9/11 by decades.<p>The Snowden leaks disclose a list with over thirty countries with competing digital intelligence programs.<p>The NSA is not about terrorism. Never was. Never will be. The NSA and CSS are the intelligence arm of the United States. New Zealand&#x27;s programs are similarly not about terrorism (what terrorists are attacking New Zealand?). Digital communications play a huge role in global communications and corporate and international power.<p>Reprised comment from here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8370973"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8370973</a>",1419829982

There are really some beautiful pieces of art (Movies, Music, etc) that are available (for purchase/viewing) to certain parts of the worlds (Eg. US) and not available to the rest (Eg. India). What makes you think that you deserve to have access to these content and the rest of them don&#x27;t?<p>You can observe this even on iTunes - &quot;Sorry the content you requested is not available in your country. Redirecting you to the <insert country here> store.&quot;<p>Sometimes, there isn&#x27;t an option to purchase these content and the only way is to download them via torrents. You see information is like light - It&#x27;s best when it&#x27;s shared. People are afraid that the more you share it, the less they will be able to meter it. But they are so wrong[1].<p>2) I am a genuine customer of Adobe. I invested heavily into their software suite. I paid several thousand dollars to upgrade their softwares so that I can keep a copy of what I paid for. One fine day, infact, the very next day after I paid for the CS6 suite, they introduced the Creative Suite cloud and fucked up so many people dependent on their software - Basically, it&#x27;s a model where you keep paying them till you die and if you don&#x27;t pay, you lose access to the software. This is probably fine with me, since I&#x27;m a business guy and I can probably afford the money. But the people who were affected the most were students - Who paid for the student subscription, but were fucked to move to the cloud and pay again: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/adobesteals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/adobesteals</a><p>Now, shortly after this happened, the piracy rates of their software suites simply skyrocketed on several torrent sites. Most of the consumers of these torrent sites are students who cannot simply afford to buy it. This in my opinion is good. Why? Because this is the only way of not supporting such companies - By using their products in a way that doesn&#x27;t benefit them (Remember, I am a legit customer who has paid for their software). At the same time, the students who can&#x27;t afford are also not at a disadvantage just because they couldn&#x27;t access a particular software suite during their course of studies.<p>There are even more benefits of torrent sites, but one thing people must understand is that torrent sites are more than just for &quot;Greedy parasites&quot;.<p>[1]<a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-piracy-boosts-music-sales-study-finds-120517/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-piracy-boosts-music-sale...</a>",1419829320

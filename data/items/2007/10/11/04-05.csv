These are things not easily gained on your own. If you really need Y-Combinator to gain success, then you better question yourself and what you offer. Personally, I know my idea will revolutionize the industry it pertains to, but submitting an application to Y-Combinator is giving me the needed kick in the butt to jump on the progress train. It's been brewing for years and tonight I'm excited. I don't need Y-Combinator, but right now I want it!",1192078721

66145,comment,66131,66137,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"Yeah I know what you mean: the inclusivity paradox: the more something wants to include something else into it, the less that other thing wants to include itself back into it. Or rather, the more a thing wants to include another, the more there is a tendency for the other to want to exclude it.<p>To equalize matters, a price is set until the two are in balance and a relationship established.<p>If YC offered more cash and demanded less equity - ie. it lowered its price, then it would be seen as better value to those who would otherwise ignore it for having better alternatives... the Googlers.<p>Furthermore, in other areas of life, at some times people give up their soul connection to become corporate drones, not knowing the true value of their creativity - yet they think they are gaining...\nAlso, sometimes establishing a relationship can be mutually advantageous for both but for some reason one wants to 'extract more' - they have to feel they are getting the better deal always and anything they give up is a burden and unjustified. This can blow the deal for both, or else cause a poor relationship unlike the one originally envisaged.",1192077303

I think you're right, there needs to be some sort of karma/credit system to keep the sleazeball squatters away and out of the community.  It also needs to accomodate all types of users (selling for cash, trading, and giving away free).  Hmmm...",1192076783
66143,comment,66131,66135,0,0,karzeem,,,"That's definitely the reason we applied.  When they came out, reviews of <i>Fooled By Randomness</i> and <i>The Black Swan</i> said wisely that for people who want to get into scalable jobs^, the main lesson of the books is to expose yourself to as much randomness as possible and to just get out there and do your thing.  Success is built on a small number of big breaks, so you need to put yourself in a situation where your chances for lucky breaks are as big as possible.  YC fits into that brilliantly, as does the argument in favor of moving to a startup hub.<p>^A scalable job, according to Taleb, is any job where given success, the amount of money you make is vastly disproportionate to the amount of time you put in--like starting a company, or becoming an actor or musician.  A non-scalable job is something like dentistry, where the amount of money you make always stays pretty closely tied to the hours you work.",1192076735
66142,comment,65969,65969,0,0,slvrspoon,,,"i looked at this space/concept a LOT years ago.  lots doing .. nothing made it.  except for fortune tellers on keen.  even google closed up shop here.  Q&A markets are free on yahoo because online non-social info is free and low value.  high value stuff is service provision (ie. doesn't scale in time) and the good people get good rates w/out messing with internet customers who tend to flake out (just try renting an apt on craigslist).  i don't see a way this works, but sure is a great idea.\n",1192076666
66140,comment,66131,66131,0,0,Alex3917,,,"From the perspective of future YC startup investors, this situation is roughly analogous to the difference between winning an honorary degree verse getting a ""merit-based"" degree.<p>People post all the time on Slashdot/Reddit complaining about the unfairness of honorary degrees. That being said, if you're about to go into surgery then which would you prefer, the doctor who earned a degree from the best medical school in the country or the doctor who was awarded an honorary degree from the best medical school in the country? I'll take the surgeon with the honorary degree any day. All the traditional degree signals is that you had good grades is college, and who cares what grades your doctor had in college? I'd much rather go for the doctor whose already recognized as the best in their field.<p>I'm not sure where I'm going with this exactly, but I guess my point was that the people who are already most likely to succeed on their own are the ones who get the biggest social signaling value from joining YC, if in fact the system works as you say.<p>edit: The appropriate buzzwords here would have been ""selection effects"" vs. ""treatment effects"" (and that selection is better than treatment for social signaling purposes).",1192076021
66139,comment,65993,66008,0,0,rams,,,"But, the YC startups themselves seem to be the beneficiaries of excellent PR efforts, appearing in Time, Newsweek etc. Somebody who is equally smart, but not YC-funded will not get this kind of visibility. I just quit from a startup funded by VCs and led by a Harvard M.B.A. While working there, I realized that we were no smarter than our competitors, yet managed to hit the headlines every now and then, for reasons that I didn't quite understand. Since a lot of investors, and at times even enterprise customers display herd mentality, this does make a difference. For instance if on the strength of it's PR efforts a startup manages to make a sale to an enterprise customer, it's valuation does go up, No ?",1192075884

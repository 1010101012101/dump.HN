9174668,comment,9172373,9174459,0,0,dasil003,,,"I think the problem is that file management does not fit Apple&#x27;s vision for the future.  It is simply too abstract a task with too many use cases to really design something simple and elegant in the spirit of how Apple normally approaches problems.  There are obviously a million ways to make the Finder better than what it is, but what Apple really wants to do is kill it entirely.  Of course they&#x27;re nowhere near being able to kill it, so instead they hold it at arm&#x27;s length as a necessary evil.<p>In the meantime, if, like me, you are stuck on OS X because it&#x27;s the best GUI for a *nix now and in the foreseeable future, I suggest buying PathFinder (<a href=""http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/</a>) to bridge the gap.

My hope is to draw out some productive dialog rather than piling on stink for flies.<p>I am sorry, but that is a line with a negative width: if you so much as hint that this may in part be the fault of males (as a whole or, even worse, individuals) pitchforks will be out. If you do not hint strongly enough that this is the fault of males (as individuals and as a group) pitchforks will be out on the other side. As a more personal point the sheer toxicity of those debates continues to shock me, even after spending more than a decade on the internet.

Until we develop a way to read minds (and it&#x27;d be great to also do the reverse: give everyone the ability to insta-learn, Matrix-style), we will continue to have to use <i>some</i> kind of signaling mechanism. Right now, there are many of them, all with various levels of difficulty, entrance requirements, and resource requirements. Many are only available to those with various types of scarce resources: free time, supportive parents and family members, and money. Let&#x27;s list some examples:<p>- get a degree in any subject (money, family support)<p>- get a degree in a more pertinent subject (money, family support)<p>- continually learn new theory/techniques/technologies on your own (time)<p>- write FLOSS code (time)<p>- get industry certifications (money)<p>- get achievements with HackerRank and other &#x27;challenge&#x27; services (time)<p>- go to interviews, answer questions (time, possibly others)<p>Not to mention all of the &#x27;administrative&#x27; things people do to communicate their capabilities (as another comment noted. Those take time, too.)<p>Something like this seems like it is taking a stab at replacing at least a few of these, but of course it still requires at least some extra resources (in this case, time.) The go-at-your-own-pace nature of it definitely works in its favor. Things like this evolve similar to technology, and its cycles of consolidation and deconsolidation; where once we may have used separate devices (for music, video, reading, etc.), we now use just a couple, or increasingly, one. Perhaps we could think of things like this as the next steps in &#x27;skill and knowledge acquisition consolidation.&#x27; Hopefully, things like this will reduce the need to spread efforts so thinly, and save us more of those scarce resources. So while it may be another monkey dance, perhaps it will allow us to dance less, but in a more focused way. Or at least stay on a smaller number of simian dance floors.<p>If nothing else, it&#x27;ll be another fun way to learn new things and experiment with theory/techniques/technology you ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t.",1425940685

I don&#x27;t use Apple products too often, but I was downloading some apps for a family members ipod touch 4g (latest model being 5g).

According to those error messages the device is basically useful, it can&#x27;t install apps any more, which is the heart of the ipod touch.<p>I searched around online and there&#x27;s an official solution. I had to install itunes on a computer and login to the same account as the Apple account on the device. Then I had to download the incorrect iOS 7 version of the free app I wanted. That would assign it as a purchase to the Apple account. Then I could delete that download. Then, I had to open up the Apple store on the device like I was doing previously, find the free app on there again, and click download. After doing all that, it wouldn&#x27;t give an error saying the device wasn&#x27;t supported, but now ask if I wanted to install the last compatible version.<p>My mind was blown. How could such popular software provide such an awful user experience? The ipod touch said the app isn&#x27;t supported for the device, but then I &#x27;buy&#x27; the free app on itunes, and magically it is supported and I can download a compatible release.",1425940639

We have a contract right now valued around $90k from a single phone call to a poorly written craigslist ad that I reached out to.  Not bad for literally about 30 minutes of a phone call and 90 minutes of discussions and negotiations.<p>No one will represent you the way you can if you are willing to learn some skills, but sometimes you need the outside help.  However, a little mentoring/guidance can go a long way if you are willing.<p>In the end work will not find you guys until you have a niche and decent reputation, and even then people who say they never look for clients I think are not being totally honest.  I met with one successful and smart guy who runs a consultancy and he swears he never looks for work it &quot;just finds him&quot;.  Well, that is sort of true but not really the whole truth or being totally honest.  Specifically in his case, he does a lot of tech training, writing and is involved in a specific tech scene.  So in the end he is doing a ton of marketing and talking about his team and their abilities, he&#x27;s just not out cold calling or using a lot of traditional marketing.<p>Also, consulting can enter into feast or famine mode unless you designate someone to keep deal flow moving.  This isn&#x27;t optional and can&#x27;t be something you do half hearted.  It takes dedication, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be sole sucking shit work, it should be fun and be a lot about pre-sales and pre-qualification of clients.  It can even be something that is a shared duty but it has to be dedicated time every week.",1425939646

One of the links says:<p>> Reader/Writer – The main problem I have with these types of objects is that it only describes a small portion of the interaction that an object can have.  A PhotoWriter is not an object, rather a Photo as an object has functionality binded to it so that it can be read or written.<p>I don&#x27;t get that though.<p>Here&#x27;s an example reader for the /etc/passwd file on my system. The reader iterates over PasswordEntry records, and the reader exposes a &quot;Location&quot; interface to get access to reader state, like the line number, which isn&#x27;t logically part of the PasswordEntry. The reader also implements the context-manager and iterator APIs:<p><pre><code>    from collections import namedtuple

What&#x27;s a better name than &quot;PasswordReader&quot;? (Other than PasswordEntryReader; I mean something which doesn&#x27;t end in &quot;-er&quot;.)<p>I don&#x27;t understand the objection &quot;it only describes a small portion of the interaction that an object can have&quot;. This is a reader, no? It reads entries, and that&#x27;s pretty much all the interaction it has.<p>> They are not classes, and the objects they instantiate are not objects. Instead, they are collections of procedures pretending to be classes.<p>I also didn&#x27;t understand this. How is the PasswordReader &quot;pretending to be a class&quot;. It is a class, and methods like the context manager methods have to be implemented through a class, and not a &quot;collection of procedures.&quot;<p>(Of course, C++ as &quot;C with classes&quot; is an example of OO programming as data structures plus a collection of procedures, where the language makes it easier to tie the two together. But that can&#x27;t be the objection as then all C++ OO code is &quot;pretending to be a class&quot;, making this an argument from extreme purism rather than one with more practical implications.)",1425939622

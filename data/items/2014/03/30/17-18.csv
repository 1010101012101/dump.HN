7497101,comment,7496154,7496154,11,0,argumentum,,,"Abolish Intellectual Property. Period.<p>IP&#x27;s time (if there ever was one) is over. There is no benefit for real inventors and artists anymore, merely for mega corporations to use the levers of government to maximize their profits at the expense of humanity and freedom. Nothing &quot;intellectual&quot; should be property.<p>I&#x27;m not against corporations or even mega corporations. I think they&#x27;d do better for themselves (and their users, more importantly) if they didn&#x27;t waste years and $billions battling each other and bullying startups and individuals over IP. Instead, they should just focus of making better things.<p><i>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.<p>That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.</i> - Thomas Jefferson",1396202326

And &#x27;unless&#x27; would make it even less readable.<p>I can understand why people insist on discussing such personal, subjective matters as &quot;readability&quot; or &quot;expressiveness&quot; - I like that too. What I don&#x27;t get is why do they confuse their impressions with facts and why do they try to generalise based on them. Is it that hard to admit that what&#x27;s readable to you may be completely unintelligible to someone else?<p>Comparison of programming languages, outside of some really technical metrics, will always be subjective and preference-based. Discussing metrics as vague as &quot;readability&quot; without even agreeing on what it means is absolutely pointless. Yet so many man-hours go into debates and blog posts, sometimes even books, which cover such issues. It&#x27;s stupid, straw-man discussion every single time it appears.<p>I really wish people would stop writing lengthy posts with a sole purpose of informing the world about their preferences.

Is he claiming that this particular situation was, or wasn&#x27;t, one of the exceptions? If it was, then how does this situation support the rule? If it wasn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s taking on a lot more responsibility; sure, maybe calling Lyft &quot;worked fine&quot; for him when he broke his elbow, but was that because he showed good judgment or because he got lucky?

Literally every other sentence screams of hyperbole.  Basically, he got arrested and had to spend the night in jail. He makes it sounds like he was locked in Guantanamo Bay.

7497083,comment,7485869,7491102,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;is there something small and replicable that a piece of software could help you do right away?&quot;</i><p>Fact checking is a huge problem. I&#x27;m not sure if call it a hair-on-fire problem. But it&#x27;s certainly pissed me off on any number of occasions. Typically, what happens is that I&#x27;ll write a story mildly critical of BigCo. The PR department at BigCo will catch wind of it, then email me and my editor with as many small &quot;corrections&quot; as they can muster, in an attempt to take down the piece.<p>When I say corrections, I don&#x27;t mean broad facts. I mean infinitesimally perceptible technicalities. For instance, I might report someone&#x27;s title as the &quot;VP of Strategy,&quot; because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s listed on this company&#x27;s website and on the person&#x27;s LinkedIn page. But the company&#x27;s PR group will come at me, screaming bloody murder, because the guy&#x27;s title is actually &quot;VP of Strategic Initiatives.&quot; They&#x27;ll do this because they&#x27;re unhappy with the broader criticism I&#x27;m leveling against their business -- so they want to pick away at as many nits as possible. It&#x27;s a guerilla harassment tactic.<p>Now, you might well ask: aren&#x27;t I just being sloppy? How hard can it be to fact check everything? The answer is: it&#x27;s damned near impossible to catch everything. Some of this information is conflicting across multiple sources. Some of it&#x27;s out of date or inaccurate. And some of it&#x27;s not even publicly available, and you wouldn&#x27;t <i>know</i> you&#x27;re slightly off until someone corrects you. (Case in point: the &quot;Strategic Initiative&quot; example, a nonsensically titled internal promotion that was never made public.) Add to this the immense pressure of weekly deadlines, and factor in how much time I need to spend ideating, researching, writing, and editing in the first place, and you see how little time I have to get every last thing 100% accurate. I&#x27;d love to be 100% accurate 100% of the time, but given my constraints, that&#x27;s rarely feasible. It&#x27;s like asking an engineer to write flawless, bug-free code at a hackathon.<p>I&#x27;d <i>love</i> a piece of software I could run my stories through, which would analyze my piece against a public data set (Google, for instance) to check for factual accuracy in all these little places. Or at least a piece of software that would throw up red flags on unverified statements, for which multiple, conflicting data exists on the web. Sort of like the little, red underlines on automatic spell check.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s not a big enough use case or TAM. But broaden it out. I&#x27;d love a better way to compile Google research about any given query. This is why I&#x27;m rooting for the stuff Wolfram is working on, though I&#x27;d love a more modifiable and specialized front end for professional users.",1396202133

You seem to imply that there are no other possible CEO candidates for Mozilla with an engineering (or in Eich&#x27;s case, computer science) background. Is that the case? I&#x27;ve followed very little of the discussion.<p>FWIW, the newest CEO of Microsoft also has a MS in CS (replacing a CEO with a bachelor degree in math and economics). How do you think that increased engineering background at Microsoft will change the industry?<p>Engineers head other organizations, including Ginni Rometty of IBM (with a bachelor in CS and EE, and first job as a systems engineer) and Pat Gelsinger of VMware (MS in EE, and contributor to six patents).

My underlying point is that comes across like saying &quot;Eich is an engineer, we need an engineer as Mozilla CEO, so hold your nose and go for an engineer rather than open up the possibility that a non-engineer might come in instead.&quot;<p>For that logic to work, you need to establish that a technical CEO is better than a non-technical one, and that no other competent engineering person is available.

I wanted to put that under a bit of pressure.<p>Derek says rather than quitting one career abruptly and moving onto the next, there should be an overlap period. In his own words:<p>Remember how Tarzan swings through the jungle? He doesn&#x27;t let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight.<p>Of course, that is great advice. But, at the same time, I worry the Tarzan image might be might be too limiting; I worry the picture it paints of people&#x27;s working lives might be too simplistic.<p>In the new online economy, the very concept of the traditional &#x27;career&#x27; is possibly dead.<p>In the 1950s, people used to make the vast majority, if not all, of their annual income from a single job. Just like Tarzan in the animation, you would only ever hold onto one vine at any one time. Moments when you holding onto two were exceptions to the norm, exceptions just like when you were transitioning between careers.<p>Is this still true today?<p>Not obviously. These days people are much happier (and able) to juggle different sources of incomes, to wear different hats at different times. Or, put in terms of the Tarzan analogy, people are much happier (and able) to hold onto multiple vines &mdash; many, many, many more than two &mdash; at any one time.<p>At one point you might be programming, writing and consulting; at another you might just be writing and consulting; at another you might be running a coffee delivery business, consulting for an e-reading start-up while making a few quid from blogging.<p>The Tarzan analogy is limiting because it encourages you to think of careers as those things that you have one of, or, at a stretch, two.<p>When it comes to careers, a better analogy might be a garden, or, even better, a window box.<p>Sources of income are like plants in this window box. At different times, some plants are smaller, some are bigger; some are growing, some are whithering; some flourish in this weather, and others flourish in that.<p>But, how can we make sense of career transitions in this new language?<p>Using this image, transitioning careers is like planting a new seed, alongside all the other plants you have growing, watering that one carefully &mdash; but not ignoring the others, maintaining a window box of flourishing flowers that will help you navigate changes in externalities like shifts in the economy and disruptive new technologies.<p>With this new image we can see another important lesson: You must adjust your skills and expertises to the changing, shifting economy; just like you should put different plants in your window box at different times of the year and in different climates and weathers.",1396201729

Design is not something you can learn in the abstract—there can be no effective design without first defining the problem(s) your project presents. I would say design is 90% problem solving and 10% aesthetics.<p>I&#x27;ve found the best way to learn design is to first understand the basics, then go out and apply them to the designs you encounter. Look at other interface/web designs and ask yourself questions based on the principles you&#x27;ve learned.

Open source software is largely built on a computer science technology base that, while sufficient, does not reflect many qualitative computer science advances that have been made in the last decade. For software that routinely leverage computer science advances (e.g. databases and parallel systems) you already see a divergence in capability and performance between platforms that are not open source and the open source world because of this lack of knowledge transfer.<p>Graph analysis platforms are a great example of this. Every open source graph analysis platform is a non-scalable toy that is useless for most real-world use cases compared to private systems that were being quietly deployed five years ago. Why the discrepancy? Because the unpublished algorithms and data structures used by some closed source systems are several orders of magnitude more scalable than is possible with the best existing public algorithms.

The law assumes a kind of classical &quot;eureka!&quot; theory of invention, where there is normal work and then the occasional Invention, which few scholars these days think is how technological advances actually happen. So if the courts were to try to read a scholarly book on either the history or current state of technological advances and try to make use of its concepts (courts sometimes do that kind of thing, if they can find something that will help them make a principled distinction) there would just be a big mismatch in basic assumptions and framework. So they don&#x27;t, and instead are stuck with trying to make the best of a kind of cobbled-together theory of what constitutes an invention vs. a non-invention. And at this point, absent Congress significantly rewriting patent law, there isn&#x27;t really much they can do except continue that process of accretion, by doing line-drawing in the gray areas of the existing case law when an opportunity arises.",1396200757

We ran out of IPv4 addresses years ago and now the Internet is heavily hacked together with various kinds of NAT which all work differently and sometimes break things. It seems a lot of engineers/IT admin out there have designed their networking setups assuming people only connect to central servers which don&#x27;t use NAT, and either ignored peer-to-peer connections or went ahead and broke them anyway. This makes innovation with peer-to-peer tech more difficult and expensive, because now to get things working for everyone you need to configure additional relay servers and pay for the bandwidth of everyone who needs to use it. That could rule out some services being made free and could mean the extra cost being passed on to customers when it could have just run through their ISPs.<p>I think the solution is IPv6. Once every device on the Internet is uniquely addressable again, we can do away with these NAT hacks and two endpoints should be able to reliably connect to each other again, no matter where they are. Of course, that&#x27;s assuming we don&#x27;t get more short-sighted engineering that breaks things again...",1396200748

I think our intuitive understanding of our social relationships is nonlinear in this way generally, and I think Strangecoin can model those nonlinear relationships well.<p>So, for instance, I&#x27;m imagining a family, spouses, close friends, and so on entering into extended coupling transactions, so that as a community their prosperity rises and falls together. I might also enter into such transactions with certain business with whom I want to couple my activities, and these coupling transactions might serve in lieu of direct billing or payment. A coupling relationship with a business is effectively a contract, but with traditional currency you need the whole legal framework of contracts to support the transaction, and with Strangecoin the transaction is built directly into the currency, and the interface looks almost exactly like a point-of-sale cash transaction.<p>And I can enter into less serious relationships of varying degrees with other parties. The effect is a way of managing not just financial transactions, but also reputation, investment, and other dynamics social constraints on the economy via the currency itself. Money is memory (<a href=""http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr218.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr218.pdf</a>), but our existing currencies only represent some aspects of our economic activity, and therefore put limits on the memory stored in the economy. A nonlinear coin like Strangecoin can embed that social knowledge in the currency itself, providing a more robust memory framework on which we can conduct our economic transactions.<p>I only hint at this in the proposal, but I suspect a system like this is required to resolve the twisted legal artifice  the corporate veil, because it quantifies explicitly the role individuals have in collective economic activity, and thereby gives a method for explicitly holding persons proportionally responsible (in both credit and blame) for their contributions to that activity.<p>But I think that&#x27;s a much more radical proposal than the one I&#x27;ve offered for Strangecoin, and I should probably only be defending that here. =)",1396200198

It&#x27;s far more confusing to allow rampant variable shadowing.  Code that relies on variable shadowing is simply broken.<p>His last example shows a fundamental misunderstanding of not just CoffeeScript, but JavaScript generally.

It covers use of the <i>method</i>, not just the code.<p>If someone, for instance, applied for a patent by describing an electronic game in which a player controlled character collects tokens inside a maze while computer-controlled characters tried to capture him, and accompanied his application with a full working copy of Pac-Man, then the patent would protect him against clones as well as direct copies. The point is not protecting against copies, that&#x27;s the job of copyright. The point is the clones.<p>Patent law is intended to safeguard innovation that one could say would not have happened otherwise.<p>As to why we need software patents, recent articles have described the legal situation better than I can in a HN comment. Basically there&#x27;s no legal distinction that has been drawn yet between software patents and other types of patents, one needs to be properly described and that&#x27;s the job of the Supreme Court. At one point they were banned because they were insufficiently distinguishable from mathematical formulas, which definitely are unpatentable.<p>Over the years, Congress decided that patents were getting too complex for the court system to properly adjudicate, so they created a separate court to hear patent cases. This court turned out to be friendly to big business and gradually opened the doors to software patents while the Supreme Court chose not to get involved.",1396199337

7496858,comment,7494709,7495957,1,0,djestrada,,,"Good comment.<p>1) You are correct that the system is designed so that users can make payments and conduct transactions even in the absence of an account balance, without incurring debt. Strangecoin allows users to act as if they have effectively unlimited wealth in terms of access to coin. Nevertheless, Strangecoin allows users to judge differences in influence on the network, so they might evaluate who they want to engage in transactions with, regardless of the account balance each has. So X might want to trade with Y instead of Z, even though both are able to pay the same number of coin individually, because Y&#x27;s network amplifies the transaction more than Z&#x27;s, and the better overall support for Y makes the transaction more attractive.<p>2) You are right that a fundamental constraint on the system is that TUA has an available balance. As I mention in the document, the most important constraint on all users (including TUA) is that their balance remains stable; users want to engage in transactions that will stabilize their overall impact on the network. TUA can adjust certain parameters to ensure a stable, nonzero balance: the basic income most importantly, but perhaps TUA can also adjust individual account caps and set limits on the allowable parameters of other transactions to ensure it has a constant, nonzero balance.<p>This is how I was imagining TUA being a universal indicator of economic prosperity of the network. If I see my TUA income go down, for instance, I know that means a drop in the overall available funds in TUA, which means the economy overall is offbalance, with more expenses than income. And I see that global property of the network directly in my account balance, and I can use that to act accordingly. Specifically, I know that if I increase my own income (or even hit the balance cap), I&#x27;ll be helping the overall economy by contributing to the TUA balance.<p>3) Inhibition seems to be giving people trouble. Being &quot;too rich&quot; isn&#x27;t normally a problem for people outside of hiphop, which I think is a source of the confusion. But being too rich in Strangecoin could be a bad thing, so I included the transaction type to provide a mechanism for negative feedback. This would be useful for some situations where users are finding it difficult to maintain an stable account, and where scaling back it&#x27;s overall influence on the network might help promote stability. If I&#x27;m making more Strangecoin than I know what to do with, this could be a bad thing for me financially because of the penalties that might accrue, so I might want to enter into inhibiting relationships to ease the pressure of those penalties.",1396198990

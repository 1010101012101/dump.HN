We could evaluate the success of such a project easily -- when we dial up 0.1 degree, does the system do what we expect?  When we dial it down, does it do what we expect?  Yes?  Fine, we&#x27;re done.  Problem solved.<p>I rather suspect climate change is just another one of these endless war things that keeps a lot of people employed and isn&#x27;t meant to be &quot;won&quot; in such a way as I have described.  We must be careful not to define the criteria for victory lest we accidentally achieve it.<p>If climate study is more than a jobs program for less brilliant scientists, what then is the point of studying climate change and recommending and implementing public policy suggestions resulting from research?<p>Is it to prevent any change to the climate?  To prevent unintentional change?  What about non-anthropogenic climate change (which could potentially be more severe and more disastrous) -- should we not seek to prevent that also?  What if by some enormous effort and sacrifice we are able to completely eliminate the anthropogenic component of climate change only to see the climate do its own thing and push life the edge of extinction anyway.  A meteor perhaps.  A new, severe ice age.  A prolonged solar anomaly.  Any of these could make a cosmic joke out of our meagre well-intentioned efforts.<p>I just don&#x27;t think people are thinking about this clearly or it is as you say, all politics.",1422240223

This was quite obvious in &quot;final Jeopardy&quot;. Watson&#x27;s response clearly showed its limitations.<p>Here&#x27;s how it went down:[1]<p><pre><code>   The category was US Cities, and the answer
   was: “Its largest airport was named for a
   World War II hero; its second largest,
   for a World War II battle.”

   The two human contestants wrote
   “What is Chicago?” for its O’Hare and Midway,
   but Watson’s response was a lame
   “What is Toronto???”
</code></pre>
Basically Watson&#x27;s Jeopardy responses were a very refined equivalent of the Google &quot;I&#x27;m feeling lucky&quot; button.<p>I have to believe that the situation gets a lot lot trickier in a &quot;medical context&quot;.<p>Still, couldn&#x27;t it be possible to harness Watson as a super-smart assistant to humans?

I could imagine something which has the software engineering benefits of an FP language without HOF, although maybe it wouldn&#x27;t culturally be one.<p>I think getting enthusiastic about higher-order functions and trying to use them in OO languages can range from good to neutral to bad.

On the negative side, it&#x27;s not necessarily more readable, and types still usually expose the same amount of information about their inputs/outputs, which is &quot;call me, anything can happen&quot; (plus plenty of opportunity for lazy side effects, the most confusing kind).",1422237836

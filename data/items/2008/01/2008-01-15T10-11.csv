98634,comment,98528,98614,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Well PHP was written by someone, too, and that improved productivity over what came before (CGI/C++?). Django and Rails aren't really central to my argument - they can be replaced with any language/library/framework that boosts productivity.<p>Careful about saying 'least abstracting' though - if it really is faster (not my experience, but assuming it is), then although it might not appear to be a powerful abstraction, it actually is, at least in some way.<p>Your abstractions (done well) are exactly what I'm talking about - long term productivity. Given 100 minutes you may well be well behind (if you've even started actually coding), but will that still be true 100 days later if the other guy is writing it in straight, hackish PHP?",1200392694

We're waiting to download the windows msi file, which optionally installs a Visual Studio integration doodad and an eclipse plugin.<p>At least, that's what the people who want to become lisp programmers want. It's probably not what the current lisp programmers want. Hey ho. Just don't make emacs the default development environment.",1200392449

98631,comment,98528,98627,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well, most of the code isn't boilerplate code. the LOC/hour statistic would interest me, is there a reference?<p>Also, the condensed style of scripting languages might waste more brain cycles than more verbose code when trying to understand it? I enjoy the condensed style and clever things you can do with it. But clever things have a tendency to also require cleverness when trying to understand what they do.",1200392019

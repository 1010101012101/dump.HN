With the decline in jobs for recent graduates and a need for a magazine truly designed for the millennial generation, Tripped Media wants to shake things up in the editorial industry.<p>The site is an online blend of journalism and blogging and of newspapers and magazines. It features topics ranging from travel, food & drinks, NYC culture, nightlife, art & design, the new iPhone and top 10 lists to articles about the Human Centipede. Sumpter, the Editor-in-Chief, graduated in May of this past year. He moved to the big city to fulfill his lifelong dream of landing a full-time job in New York, but found it tough to do so. He and his friends took a long, hard look at todays online media. They looked at Vanity Fair, GQ, The New York Post, and even The New York Times and found themselves dissatisfied.

Not everyone will sign up and its a slow and painful process, but this is the best way to get to know your users and their needs early on.

The best alternative is to reach out to the people around you (like your neighbors directly), as well as communities online that relate to the sort of problem you're aiming to solve (hopefully there is a problem you're solving and not just a solution).

There is no fundamental problem underlying the whole field--for every researcher working on things you find useless for industry, there are probably several working on things which are useful.<p>Finally, this may be due to my university being more pragmatic than some, but most of the research going on that I've heard about is actually immediately practical. The single largest issue a ton of professors seem to be working on is parallelism and distributed computing, which is indubitably extremely important to industry <i>right now</i>.

Law reviews publish students and practitioners in addition to professors. You see articles not just about abstract theory, but the mechanics of some new tax provision.

It was a nice machine initially but I found that it ended up looking pretty tattered (particularly the plastic edge, which looks and feels cheap and a bit fragile in the long run). Most annoyingly, it had a tendency to overheat, particularly when dual booting into Ubuntu. After about 20 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t leave the thing on my knees - had to find a table. Both the &quot;tablet/screen&quot; and the base were affected.<p>It was portable and powerful enough, but the MBPr gives me a much better overall experience. At half, perhaps 2/3 of the price of the 13&quot; MBPr, it might still be worth it.",1424339989

They would loan money to a farmer at harvest time, or actually well before harvest, at planting time, based on a price guarantee at harvest. If the farmer decided not to sell or had a price below that loan rate, the farmer had the right to turn that corn over to the government. Which they did. And the government owned warehouses but they also contracted with private people who had warehouses. They did this--in the case of milk, the government didn&#x27;t buy raw milk from the farm.

Gender stereotypes are much more likely picked up from how ones parents behave than from toys.

It&#x27;s possible and people are working on making it easier, but it&#x27;s rough territory still.<p>Javascript is easier, ghcjs (while still a bit tricky to install) is 1.0 and lets you compile arbitrary GHC Haskell (including all extensions, lightweight threads and STM) to JS for both Node.js and the browser. Template Haskell support is on the way too.<p>Calling the C FFI from Haskell is fairly trivial in my experience. If you have structs you want to manipulate from inside haskell it&#x27;s a bit cumbersome and confusing initially, but if you&#x27;re just using primitive types and pointers it&#x27;s easy.<p>Haskell does very well for high-performance when it comes to IO, as-of GHC 7.8&#x27;s new IO manager the fastest Software-Defined Networking (SDN) application is written in Haskell [1]. In terms of pure computation bound performance Haskell, does well enough, optimising truly high-performance Haskell is as much arcane art as optimising C (we&#x27;re talking &quot;I want microsecond inner-loops&quot; level of optimising). In general I would say that you should expect Haskell to be around JIT Java levels of speed for most cases where the code is not blatantly inefficient. So certainly an order of magnitude faster than python/ruby.<p>Lots of people complain about performance reasoning in Haskell being hard, which is partially true. But mostly, IMO it is simply <i>different</i> from doing so in C, so you need to unlearn/relearn all your performance tweaking skills.<p>As for Haskell vs Clojure and becoming a better developer. I think Clojure looks like an interesting language, but I would recommend learning Haskell anyway. Why? Because Haskell is one of the &quot;most different&quot; languages in which people are still writing lots of real world code. Which means that it will expose you to the largest number of new concepts while still having decent practical library support. Key features, IMO are: Purity, type system, laziness, and type classes.<p>Incidentally, I would urge everyone to please stop using this silly &quot;transpile&quot; word. Compile is already source-to-source and introducing a new silly sounding word for it isn&#x27;t helping anyone.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask035-voellmy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask03...</a>",1424337161

Also, spectrum will be cheap at night and more expensive during crowded days. By having an exchange, ideally, prices will reflect the actual cost of infrastructure providers, which should be the basis to set retail prices for customers.<p>So my question is: What kind of principle is behind such an idea where one company could potentially own _all_ spectrum and deny other companies the possibility to offer anything wireless at all?",1424337081

9073109,comment,9071748,9071748,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I&#x27;m not a fan of this argument. It all hinges on the assumption that information density is what a language should optimize for. The problem is that <i>ease of disambiguation</i> is also an extremely important feature in human languages and one that tends to oppose the goal of information density. In the extreme form, information density would suggest reducing all characters to binary or some other compressed encoding, but due to the necessity of easy disambiguation no human language could get to such an extreme state and remain widespread.<p>One observed example of the importance of disambiguation is the phenomena of extremely common words becoming irregular. In virtually every single language that has verb conjugations, the conjugations of the most common verbs—to be, to have, to do, etc—are irregular. As languages change and acquire verb conjugation, there is actually a documented process of irregularization for the most common words! The same is true with phonetic irregularities (e.g. &quot;you&quot; in English or the は particle in Japanese).<p>Language is read far more often than it is written. Especially in this age of electronic input, stroke reduction is a trivial concern compared to recognition of very dissimilar words such as &quot;nothing&quot; vs &quot;sky&quot; (無 vs 天) / (无 vs 天) or &quot;noodle&quot; vs &quot;face&quot; (麵 vs 面) / (面 vs 面). I think the Chinese character simplification is a fine short-hand tool, but it&#x27;s not great for literacy and it&#x27;s not great. Japanese simplifications, on the other hand, were a lot less extreme. They simplified some of the most ridiculous traditional characters, but generally left the semantic information in characters intact.<p>I used to write quite a bit about this topic:

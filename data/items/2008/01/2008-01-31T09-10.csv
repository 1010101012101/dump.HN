Here's an industry-insider article upset about ""trashing Von Neumann machines when there's no alternative"".<p>But pensioners who read the New York Times (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/technology/17chip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/technology/17chip.html</a>) know the problem is that Von Neumann architecture is already dead.  The CBE (the PS3 chip) has 8 cores, Tilera has 64, Intel is working on a 128 core chip, etc.<p>The question isn't, ""Will vector processors prevail?"", but, ""What are we going to do in the software industry to handle the fact that this is the future.""",1201771213

107332,comment,107132,107277,0,0,icky,,,"> I think many people mistakenly thought Arc was supposed to be some new kind of framework like Ruby on Rails.<p>- Didn't you hear?  Arc, the language, uses <i>tables</i> in its HTML!<p>(My god, I would never use <i>a programming language</i> that was <i>ever</i> used to generate <i>tables!</i>)<p>- The zeroth release of Arc only supports ASCII!  What about us EBCDIC users?!<p>- Arc didn't cure my unsightly dandruff, like I hoped and prayed it would!<p>- Arc is out and Jesus didn't come back!<p>- I downloaded Arc and the tarball just sat there in the directory, doing <i>nothing!</i><p>- Arc doesn't completely integrate itself with its temporary host language!<p>- Arc killed my entire village, just as we were about to start our annual Unicode Festival!<p>- Arc is just a bunch of library functions and syntactic transformations on a parse tree that ultimately compiles to machine code.  <i>There is NOTHING new here!</i><p>(Did I miss any? ;-)",1201770771

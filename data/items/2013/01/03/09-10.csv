It's perfectly possible that life expectancy decreased following invention of agriculture and that people had more stressful lives, but the other benefits of social organisation so totally make up for that, as shown by the huge increase in life expectancies since then.

5001625,comment,5000328,5001015,3,0,alexqgb,,,"That's an understatement. Here in California, politicians reacted to the idea with an incandescent, frothing-at-the-mouth rage peppered with (political) death-threates aimed at anyone who dared to make an issue of the issue. But thanks to the direct-initative process, they didn't have to power to actually block it. The direct initiative system has been the source of a lot of grief, and frankly, it has a lot to answer for. But in this case, it proved to be worth its weight in gold. Indeed, it may be the thing that leads to the end of gerrymandering throughout America.<p>Until very recently, California was polarized even more sharply than Washington DC, and seats were filled with ideological firebrands backed by primary voters who would punish ""compromise"". This chronic disunity meant we unable to use the power of our size effectively. But now that we're steadily replacing those folks with people who can safely operate together, our reps can safely ignore their parties to vote as a uniform block that only cares about itself. Coming from a state as big as California, that represents a major a threat. In another election cycle or two, California will have enough unity to become the swing vote on anything. And yes, you can expect it to use this power ruthlessly. Nothing will move unless there's something in it for California, and given the size and diversity of the state, it'll be a rare issue that passes without California extracting some major concession from the other States. It'll be all take and no give, all the time, on everything.<p>Power this substantial and unchecked will be deeply resented and increasingly abused. For other big states, the only way to stop the pain will be to start operating the same way themselves. Florida is well on its way to ending gerrymandering. Governor Cuomo is starting to make an issue of it in New York. If they can start operating as post-partisan blocks, they can work together to neutralize California's power. Once Texas and Illinois get into the game (in that order, I suspect), the political dynamic will be Big States vs. Small States Further Disadvantaged By Intractable Partisan Rifts. Applying pressure of this magnitude to what will be perennial losers should cause the whole sordid institution to collapse entirely, subordinating politicians to people rather than parties in all 50 States. In retrospect, the madness we're living through now will look a lot like the crime-ridden hell scape of New York City in the 70's, as seen from the 90's on.",1357206247

On a private screen they could open a ""backdrop window"" covering the whole background, and treat it as a full screen UI. And/or they could also open floating windows on top of it.<p>- Applications or a utility could open <i>public</i> screens or place windows on existing public screens. These acted as extra desktops. Say I wanted a shell and a text editor in it's own workspace per project I'm working on.<p>Most larger applications let you choose between working in a window on the workbench screen, ""fullscreen"" on a private screen, or in a window on a public screen.<p>Screens can be ""pulled down"" to reveal the screen behind, if you for example want to have a quick look without losing your train of thought.<p>I'm 95% of the way back there now, with Ubuntu with Unity (even got the global menu bar back - yay!), but there are still annoying niggles in my workflow..<p>Another 10 years and maybe the rest of what I miss from AmigaOS will have made it back into the mainstream (datatypes, more pervasive unified scripting support of applications, user interfaces that don't grind to a halt when the machine is under a bit of load, to mention three...)",1357205172

I don't see how that reflects on his 'genius' in any shape or form. Instead it demonstrates ignorance and it's a point that someone who actually is just a little read up on Da Vinci wouldn't make.<p>We only have a fragment of his work documented today, and just on that alone, his brilliance in the many fields he was interested is clearly observable.<p>'he was an excellent illustrator'...\nThat's like looking at his anatomical drawings and concluding he's a great illustrator without really understanding what he was drawing.<p>Only fairly recently has it been discovered exactly how well Da Vinci understood the workings of the aortic valve and blood flow. He used similar methods of flow visualisation that researchers used to make similar findings about the working of the heart in the 1990s (source <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00348-002-0478-8?LI=true#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00348-002-0478-8...</a>). It took over 500 years for the field to catch up in that respects.<p>He figured out why the sky appears blue (requiring understanding in optics and physics), the cause of heart disease, created some of the first robotics. If Da Vinci's work was accepted and published out in the open during his time, his impact on several fields would be highly influential.<p>'Hardly any of his engineering worked' \nFor a better appreciation of his engineering prowess, maybe check out some of the many attempts to replicate his machines. Granted some sketches (which is what we're left with) don't work as is (if that's what you're expertly judging), but as is the case with engineering, you learn by iterating designs and testing real models, a luxury not given to Da Vinci for each of his many projects.<p>(And I wonder why people keep replicating his work if he was such an ordinary engineer)<p>A lot of those experiments to replicate have been made into documentaries and are good fun to watch.

Astronomy taught us that our earth isn't the center of the universe but merely one of billions of heavenly bodies. From biology we learned that we weren't specially created by God but evolved along with millions of other species. Now archaeology is demolishing another sacred belief: that human history over the past million years has been a long tale of progress. In particular, recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward a better life, was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.""<p>Science, astronomy, biology and archaeology -- all advanced culture -- cannot happen without the critical mass of population provided by cities, fed by agriculture.

315635,comment,315142,315142,0,0,trominos,,,"Your engine actually seems superior to Google in some ways, which is fantastic. I've always wondered if a single person could do something technologically novel in search; you seem to have done so. I wouldn't be surprised if your engine opens the doors to real, widespread innovation in search.<p>Your UI isn't great, though. Some unordered points:<p>• Your name is bad.<p>• Your text is too big.<p>• The whole thing feels too unprofessional.<p>• You need to show more search results by default. Four results feels claustrophobic. People won't get overwhelmed, they've been living with long results lists for ten years.<p>• You need to make the traditional ordered list of results distinct from the other pieces of information that your search engine thinks are relevant. Right now it can be hard to distinguish results from extras, and I think that will be an impediment to getting users (if getting users is in fact your goal). In particular, don't put the topic-filtering questions above the results — put them to the side.<p>• Don't highlight the result that I'm mousing over.<p>• Get rid of the little arrows next to links.<p>Actually, I'd suggest going to Google, writing down every difference between their UI and yours, and asking yourself why you did it differently. I don't think the Google UI is necessarily the ultimate way to present search results, but I don't think you've added much, either, and theirs is pretty damn good.<p>Technology: right now your search engine doesn't seem to understand that recent events are more important, typically, than past ones; a search for ""explanation of the economic crisis"" didn't produce anything in the top four results (although the fifth one, ironically, was relevant). Google gave me what I was looking for (although it's notable that if I <i>hadn't</i> been looking for stuff about the current crisis, your engine would have been better).",1222389883

315633,comment,315603,315603,0,0,endtwist,,,"I...don't really like this article, frankly.<p>Other than being fairly light on information to begin with, the title brings up (what I believe is) the least important part of the article. I can't really speak to being married and trying to run a start-up (still in college), but from what I've read, it is entirely possible. The major thing is having kids -- not being married, or even who you are married to (at least, not nearly as much). If the ""married"" thing is a metaphor for some of the other rules, such as #2, then they're really stretching it.<p>I do agree with numbers 1 through 4, though they really could have beefed up the article with some more information and detail. For example, one sentence for #3 gets the point across, but leaves me hanging a bit.<p>On my earlier note though, can anyone speak to being married/having kids and trying to...start...a start-up? I'm curious what the experience is like, as opposed to being single and/or just having a girlfriend.",1222389818

315620,comment,314941,315424,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Actually my brother and a good friend recently attended a conference on the subject, and I'm not pulling numbers out of the air. Clearly there is room for dispute, but between 10B and 1000B is a most reasonable range. I also disagree in principle that anything could cost $700T dollars. Are you telling me that the whole of the US working for 50 years couldn't build it? Because US GDP is ~$14T.<p>Also, you don't launch a company and next year make an elevator. There is a lot of tech to develop. You don't just sit on that tech. Materials made cheap enough to build a earth bound tether would have plenty of other applications. As would the automated or teleoperated construction robots.<p>Also, the first elevator on the moon wouldn't require much innovation in materials at all.<p>But I do have a very armchair understanding of the topic.",1222388947

The code from OneLogin [1] was the clearest example I found, but it leaves various things as an exercise for the reader, such as obtaining the relevant public key and establishing trust in that key.<p>I ended up doing a lot of custom stuff that is highly specific to the particular SAML implementation in use at my company. For example, the public signing key is included with the SAML response (on successful sign on) as an x509 certificate. I extract if from there and establish trust by verifying the signature chain (up to the root SSL certs included in my distro). But, SAML also allows embedding raw RSA or DSA keys, or presumably none at all (and you&#x27;d store the trusted key somewhere as a configuration value).

Maybe there is a valid reason to have such an objection, but I do not hold this perspective personally.<p>Regardless, your comparison here is not valid, since you are comparing the process of configuring optional functionality in systemd (which has no equivalent with sysv) to the process of configuring a cron daemon (which you could just as easily be using with either init system).",1413564626

Go does this, at the cost of some boilerplate, with the ByAge interface.

            return a.(Person).Age < b.(Person).Age
        })
        fmt.Println(people)

    }

    func SortBy(elts []interface{}, less func(a, b interface{}) bool) {
        sort.Sort(byFunc{elts, less})

Freestream momentum is deflected some net angle by a wing.  If you take a horizontal vector and tilt it, the length is reduced, and the height is increased. The equal and opposite reactions of the freestream momentum deflection are lift and drag on the wing. Turns out, the change in height is larger than the change in length. The following equation expresses the lift to drag ratio: sin(phi) / (1-cos(phi)+f). The phi is not angle of attack, but the net tilt angle of the freestream induced by the wing. There is some correlation between the two of course. f is a non-conservative skin friction factor.<p>I view aerodynamic phenomena such as stall and Coanda effect as mechanisms that interfere or enable the deflection capability of wings.",1413564416

But to give you more details these are the things I&#x27;m focusing on with the book:<p>1. Word of mouth referrals. This is the old school way to get recurring revenue. But I&#x27;ve seen a lot of freelancers fail at this. Specifically, delivering the client exactly what they envision AND positioning the client to be successful. If they aren&#x27;t successful, then they&#x27;re going to be out of business soon, and that means you&#x27;re going to have one less word of mouth referral out there.<p>2. Support contracts. If you&#x27;ve done a good job at 1, then there&#x27;s a good chance that you&#x27;re the client&#x27;s only line of support for their project. Just because you&#x27;ve delivered all the code and launched the app doesn&#x27;t mean the work is done. What happens if their users have questions or feature requests? What happens if their site goes down? By offering support contracts you can continue to invest in a client&#x27;s long term success, keep that referral hot, and start building recurring revenue for your business by having a support contract that renews annually or quarterly.<p>3. Productized consulting. As a freelancer you learn a ton of skills on the job. Sometimes these skills are applicable to other clients. If so, you should package this offering. 37signals did this a long time ago by offering to redesign a single page on a site for a flat fee. I have interviews with people who are doing this kind of thing with Stripe integrations. The other side of this coin is that you have to position yourself as an authority on the package you are offering. By doing so you further diversify your recurring revenue by having leads generated based on your expertise.<p>4. Product sales. This is kind of the &#x27;unicorn&#x27; of the bunch. If you are building an application for a client that has no interest in selling or owning it (i.e. research departments, internal tools for large organizations, etc) you can take ownership of the product and sell it to yourself. I&#x27;ve seen this happen a handful of times and it essentially multiplies your revenue because it produces work in 1, 2, and 3.<p>Hope this helps.",1413563185
8471729,comment,8467772,8470835,0,0,benjaminjackman,,,"Oh ok that makes sense. Either has a little more to it, as I am sure you are aware, specifically Type Disjunction, but a crappy version of Result is all anyone ever really uses it for as far as I have seen.<p>Real quick for those that don&#x27;t understand, when I say Type Disjunctions (aka union types) I mean a type which has a value which the type system is guaranteeing is 1 of X different types. So Either[String,Int] is a specialized case where X=2 and the value is either a String or an Int. This ends up being really similar to Tuples, Tuples are often given their own syntax, typically, (A,B,...) and frequently in languages that don&#x27;t support the tuple abstraction natively, things like std::pair<A,B> pop up as a poor substitute special cased to X=2 element tuples.<p>This leads to my view that Either is to Type Disjunctions as something like std::pair is to Tuple, scratching the surface of a deeper and much richer abstraction. When it pops up in your language its a symptom of lacking type unions, just as std::pair is a symptom of lacking tuples.<p>Do you think Rust will ever have native support for type disjunctions?<p>I understand that it probably principly uses object hierarchys for this type of stuff, and in a lot of ways that makes a lot of sense, but often time when writing statically typed message passing code, aka Consumers / Producers, the more ad hoc representation + syntax support for unions eliminates huge traunches of boilerplate and provides static guarantees that all the cases are handled consider this code for example.<p>As real world, recurring pain in the neck example, in Scala to preserve type safety and exhaustiveness checking at my company we create a sealed trait hierarchy where each subclass wraps each different type in the disjunction.<p>It&#x27;s a poor man&#x27;s type disjunction and it takes A LOT of boilerplate.<p>Its still worth it to jump through these hoops because in a message passing system built around producers/consumers(aka, sources/sinks, emitters/handlers etc) we get the following important benefits:<p>a. Only messages that fall in a set of allowed types can be passed into a handler, guaranteeing that a message the handler can&#x27;t handle won&#x27;t be passed to it.<p>b. A handler is typically backed by a match expression which handles the different subtypes the handler handles. We used a sealed trait in scala pattern which guarantees that if someone adds another type to the hierarchy without adding it to all the handlers (which might be in different codebases) there is a compile error for a non-exhaustive match in the handler&#x27;s implementation instead of a runtime blowup there when the unhandled type falls through the match.<p>Obviously this is just scratching the surface of the benefits that type disjunction can provide. Hopefully enough programmers and language designers will have an &#x27;aha moment&#x27; and realize that just as adding lambda&#x27;s to abbreviate anonymous functions opens up the world of higher order functions, and tuples just eliminate doing the same thing thousands of crappy different ways, and having an Option (aka Maybe) type eliminates null pointer exceptions, and hopefully standard library sanctioned Result type eliminates unhandled exceptions, having language support for type disjunctions will have benefits similar to all these other `essential` features.<p>TL;DR Type Disjunctions are really useful, and are missing fundamental in most type systems do you think Rust will support them?",1413563181

8471714,comment,8471355,8471666,0,0,bradgignac,,,"IMO, this is one area where Go shines. In a non-compiled language, you have to bear the burden of the upgrade process when writing code AND when running code. For example, if you update Python on you application servers and there is a breaking change, you break running applications that may not have been touched for weeks, months, or even years. With Go, you build a binary at the time the code was released and you never need to touch that binary again. Your binary can run forever even if breaking changes are introduced later.<p>As with Python, you still need to update code in subsequent releases to work with the breaking changes. However, in my experience, this isn&#x27;t the hard part. The hard part is keeping your existing code running while staying on a recent version of your favorite language runtime. This is even more painful in an environment where multiple application run on the same server. If you write a new application using Ruby 1.9.x but an older application will only run on Ruby 1.8.x, you need to either split them across multiple servers or update the old application to run on 1.9.x. There are tools to handle this (rbenv, rvm, chruby, etc), but this is exactly the type of complexity I talk about reducing in my post.",1413563052

Much of it seems to be more like the manual ST should have had but never has, describing routine tools and pointing out keyboard shortcuts that you could find for yourself just exploring the default keyboard map. That is certainly a useful gap to fill, but there seems to be little if anything in the table of contents about real power user features like defining or customising languages, templates/snippets, themes, plugins, etc. I hope the choice of title doesn&#x27;t lead to disappointment from actual power users while causing those who would enjoy and benefit from the book to go elsewhere.<p>I did notice that the sample chapter PDF has quite a few obvious layout problems, and that the expanded TOC on the web site has obvious typos, so the jury is out on editorial/production quality.<p>As a final comment, the author seems very keen on ST3, which makes me hesitant. I gave up and installed ST3 myself a little while ago, after too many packages I relied on self-updated into just not working any more on ST2. Now instead of a productive text editor that I enjoyed and recommended a year or two ago, I have a crash-prone, bug-ridden mess, which just has different packages I used to rely on that don&#x27;t work reliably instead. So I&#x27;m pretty down on the whole fragmented ST ecosystem and lack of progress/support for existing customers right now. While I assume none of this is the author&#x27;s fault, perhaps the timing of this book launch is unfortunate; it might be a better buy if and when ST3 and its package ecosystem are up to production quality, updated to reflect whatever the best available supporting packages are at that time.",1413562959

Throughout the parse tree there is an implicit DAG of dependencies - this value affecting that read operation over there, etc. The real trick in making a generic output routine from a bfft is reversing this DAG, so e.g., if I add a pixel down here the parse tree can re-stabilize automatically into something valid. This also opens the door to generic editing of binary formats. My understanding is that DAG reversal is an NP-complete problem, but I suspect with file formats we&#x27;re dealing with a subset of the space and it might not be as difficult as I am imagining.",1413562368

In Go, you have to implement `sort.Interface` for each custom type you define. An example taken from the `sort` package:<p><pre><code>    package main

    import (
        &quot;fmt&quot;
        &quot;sort&quot;
    )

    type Person struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }

    func (p Person) String() string {
        return fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%s: %d&quot;, p.Name, p.Age)
    }

    // ByAge implements sort.Interface for []Person based on
    // the Age field.
    type ByAge []Person

    func (a ByAge) Len() int           { return len(a) }
    func (a ByAge) Swap(i, j int)      { a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i] }
    func (a ByAge) Less(i, j int) bool { return a[i].Age < a[j].Age }

    func main() {
        people := []Person{
            {&quot;Bob&quot;, 31},
            {&quot;John&quot;, 42},
            {&quot;Michael&quot;, 17},
            {&quot;Jenny&quot;, 26},
        }

        fmt.Println(people)
        sort.Sort(ByAge(people))
        fmt.Println(people)

    }
</code></pre>
An equivalent in Python is quite a bit simpler:<p><pre><code>    class Person(object):
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def __repr__(self):
            return &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (self.name, self.age)

    people = [
        Person(&quot;Bob&quot;, 31),
        Person(&quot;John&quot;, 42),
        Person(&quot;Michael&quot;, 17),
        Person(&quot;Jenny&quot;, 26),
    ]

    print people
    people.sort(key=lambda person: person.name)
    print people
</code></pre>
If it were just sorting, it wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal. But there&#x27;s a lot of nice abstractions missing from Go due to the lack of generics - e.g. higher-order functions like `map`.",1413562039

We use quay.io for building our repositories, triggered by a github commit.<p>I agree with what others have said, and for us, the biggest benefit we see is keeping our production environment up to date, and stable.  We&#x27;re a small shop, and want to waste as little time as possible maintaining our production environment.  We were able to go from 1 host (that occasionally went down -- and downtime for every deploy) to a 3-node coreos cluster fairly easily.  We can also scale up, or even recreate the cluster, very easily.",1413561724

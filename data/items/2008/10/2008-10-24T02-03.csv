Staff journalists don't vary _that_ much in quality (though editorial standards do) and there's tons of fresh meat coming out of j-school every year.<p>The most valuable asset that the New York Times has is its brand.

While most of the times, people say that marketing is all about common sense, time and again Apple has been sailing in the direction opposite to the wind, doing things that defy common sense, and creating newer and newer success models! Be it, launching better iPod to kill the existing ones or opting for a no subsidy model with AT&T.",1224817087

341983,comment,341043,341539,0,0,gamble,,,"I seriously doubt that the same pressure to consolidate will ever apply in the mobile phone market the way it did to early PCs.<p>Prior to the Internet, the <i>only</i> thing you could do with a PC was run software written specifically for each platform. The average computer in the late 80s/early 90s cost between $3-5000. It made sense that people would settle on a single standard that let them get the most out of a very large investment.<p>However, 90% of what people do with smartphones - calls, email, music, web browsing - is inevitably provided with the phone. 3rd-party apps are a nice addition, but hardly necessary. The iPhone and Blackberry got along just fine without them for years, whereas Palm and WiMo are floundering despite having allowed 3rd-party apps for the last decade.",1224815988

I would also like to add that they do seem to have a good idea.  I know that I agree with their logic of how annoying it is to be expected to fill out surveys months, days, or even hours later when I'm at  home on my computer and take up my own time.  This is the kind of product that would have potential to become as prevalent as credit card processors at most retail chains.  While you're waiting for everything to get bagged, or even that damn receipt to print, just fill out this survey on a sleek and simple device.",1224814891

Otherwise how would they share it with other ""techies""?<p>Agreed. ""Anyone"", rather than ""everyone"". (I tried different phrasings about how, unlike doctors, ""techies"" are likely to communicate semi-publicly on the internet, but I stumbled with words and decided the other aspect was a more important point to make.)<p>And about inter-discipline discussion, absolutely.

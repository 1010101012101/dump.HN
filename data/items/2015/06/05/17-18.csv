9666923,comment,9666093,9666093,0,0,jcfrei,,,"I see a fundamental problem with shifting the responsibility for uncertain profits (due to changes in laws) from corporate entities to national entities. I believe that the uncertainties from investing in a certain country (ie. investing in nuclear reactors in Germany) should entirely be carried by the (private) investors themselves - and not by the governments. As a recent example: There is an ongoing dispute where a Swedish utility (Vattenfall) sued the German government for their plan to phase out nuclear energy.<p>If governments are suddenly held accountable for (lost) profits of private companies we create a huge imbalance. Where the private entities reap the benefits of successful investments but the governments carry the burden if such investments fail (due to legislative action by the government). This is particularly worrisome because the higher tax revenues generated by a successful (or successfully suing) company might benefit an entirely different country.<p>Thus this whole process essentially creates a race to the bottom in terms of consumer and environmental protection, as well as a huge barrier to the introduction of new regulations. Again, reducing regulations by itself doesn&#x27;t have to be bad at all - frankly it&#x27;s quite a good process. The only problem is that now the public gets excluded from the debate and instead an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) process - held at international arbitration courts - will decide which regulations are allowed and which are not.<p>In conclusion this further emphasizes - or to put it more drastically - ultimately codifies the primacy of economics over democracies.",1433527169

As I understand it, making any Valve Source Engine game available on Linux is now relatively trivial. Likewise, OpenGL got a big boost from Valve committing to developing for Linux. So, many games that weren&#x27;t explicitly developed <i>for</i> Linux have had reasonable ports made available, and it&#x27;s cost game makers less than ever before to do so.<p>I was ecstatic to see Civ V available for Linux, for example, since Civ (and other Sid Meier games) has never had a Linux port in the past.<p>As I said, I buy a lot more games than I used to...but only games with Linux versions.

9666881,comment,9666812,9666812,0,0,chollida1,,,"> Getting allocations of corporate bond deals is one of the easiest ways for managers to outperform benchmark bond indexes because they’re typically sold at a discount to market rates, according to Jason Shoup, the head of U.S. high-grade credit strategy at Citigroup Inc. The bonds aren’t added to the indexes investors are measured against until the end of each month. That can generate as much as 0.2 percentage point of additional gains for investors who get in early, Shoup said.<p>If you ever wanted to know about the bond market there are two pieces of gold in the above lines.<p>1)  Getting in on new issues is free money.  Stocks are the same.  Steve Cohen at SAC was famous for overpaying on commissions just to get the first call for new issues.  When bond funds return 1.1% and beat the market having an additional 0.2% really puts you ahead of the competition to the tune of 18% in gains for free.<p>2) The fact that the gain is 0.2%, not 2% or 20%, 0.2%.  Bonds are a volume game.  You find an angle to make 0.2% and lever the hell out of it.  Having said that, this is the playbook directly from LTCM.",1433526813

If you use NPM (which, if you&#x27;re doing modern JavaScript, you should be using) you already have a task runner.

But the vast majority of projects using them just use them to run one or two tasks that already have a CLI. In those cases it&#x27;s over-engineering a non-problem.<p>I agree that AngularJS is needlessly complex. It hides a lot of straightforward ideas behind confusing terminology (&quot;this is a service, this is a constructor, but a constructor isn&#x27;t actually a constructor, it&#x27;s a function that creates a service, no not that kind of service, that one&#x27;s just a function <i>called</i> service because reasons&quot;).

If your &quot;app&quot; is just a bunch of static content, it&#x27;s probably just a conventional website and jQuery is likely sufficient. It&#x27;s a good general solution and with some discipline you can even solve moderately complex problems with it.<p>Other projects are not as likely to stick around as long as jQuery has but small and specialised enough that they can be replaced relatively easily (i.e. without a major rewrite of all the code) in the future if necessary.<p>If you just want to build a website, you can probably get away with using jQuery. If you just want to write a node.js web server, you can probably get away with just using express. If you just need utility functions, you can probably get away with underscore.<p>Besides, even if you use hot spanking new technologies, you should still strive to make your code as maintainable as possible given what you have.

One day everyone had one and good ones were a status symbol, the next they&#x27;re all be relegated to special occasions (and even then rare).<p>People make these claims a lot but they have it backwards. Good watches were a status symbol because at one point &quot;everyone&quot; had a watch and you could stand out from the crowd by having a good one. Now nobody has one and they&#x27;re now a differentiator rather than a status symbol (which means they appeal to a different demographic).<p>I personally think if watches survive as a format at all (smart watches aren&#x27;t assured to stay around, by the way), traditional watches will diminish as people buy high end smart watches for status AND functionality, rather than simply buying a traditional watch for status alone (and appearing a bit hipsterish for doing so).",1433526702

If you don&#x27;t make a frequency list from a large corpus, your Anki deck sucks too.<p>Duolingo and Memrise seem to have the philosophy, &quot;There are many words in the language you&#x27;re learning. Here are some of them.&quot; This is really bad.<p>Because word frequencies follow a Zipfian distribution, if you learn the top 1,000 words in a language you&#x27;re a long way forward. If you learn an arbitrary 1,000 sample of words in a 40,000 word vocabulary, you&#x27;re much further back.<p>These guys seem to have this as their specific value proposation.

Although you will always be looked down upon by CS college grad peers once big O and Algorithms / data structures discussions are coming up. Even if you know it better than them! (They just assume that you don&#x27;t as you don&#x27;t have a degree)<p>But the bigger downside if you truly choose to be solely a craftsmen is that you always have to keep up or your are out. Technologies change, and if you don&#x27;t change with them, you are obsolete. Even if you know HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Rails to the level you memorized them and have built an impressive portfolio with 2000 stars in GitHub and 10 HN front page submissions. Ask yourself where is that guy who did this 10 years ago? I was one of those, I had Flash stuff that was the equivalent to the above. Got Macromedia site of the day, people in forums and myspace praised my work, I got my work presented in FlashForward conferences. \nDoes it worth anything now? zip, nada. think 10-15 years from now. will a starred github JQuery plugin you wrote get you that job when you are 35? 45? 55?<p>In the other hand, if you want transferable skills that are not framework related, you need to either self learn it, (which is hard to prove) or get a degree. the degree serves the following:<p>10% - the actual knowledge (you can get it anywhere), 40% - the self discipline structure that forces you to &quot;self learn&quot;. think of it as a challenge, you pay tuition, they force you to stay focused and self learn by going to lectures / watching them online. 30% - is the easy verification that you know those things, instead of reading your portfolio and looking for usage of data structures / algorithms (e.g. anything that is not just &quot;trade skills&quot; or &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, future employers can just see your degree, and assume (if you got a decent GPA and it&#x27;s a decent university) that you got that at least covered. \nthe last 20% is as others said - soft skills implied from graduating college. employers know that you can handle life on your own, handle deadlines, handle working with a team, handle pressure, and do something that is not immediate gratification.<p>You can always choose to also be a craftsman after you get your degree, in practice, specific technical skills are very important and valuable for employers.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to limit the jobs you can apply for, you need to prove 2 things -<p>1) that you have your CS basics (Algorithms,  Data Structures etc) otherwise you rule out many interesting jobs (not just at Google / Facebook, but also many web startups that need more than just CRUD / web / mobile)<p>2) that you can actually code and use that knowledge in a specific tech stack.<p>You can prove #2 easily by going the portfolio way. \nYou make it harder to prove #1 by going the portfolio way, and make it easier by going the degree way.<p>p.s. you can get a CS top 10 US education for about $10,000<p>Step 1: get an accredited US CS undergrad degree online for $4,000 at <a href=""http://uopeople.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uopeople.edu</a><p>Step 2: apply to Georgia Tech Online Master of Science (degree is the same as on-campus degree, which is ranked #9 in the US for Graduate Computer Science degree) and pay only about $6,600 and you don&#x27;t need a GRE! (as opposed to the on campus one). you just need to get B and above in 2 core courses to be fully admitted (not always easy, but doable)<p>The amount of jobs you can do after that grows largely. And I think it will be a little more interesting than just doing the same old CRUD / Mobile / UI until you retire, and having to learn every 10 years or so a whole new paradigm.<p>Just think of all the build tools, frameworks that there are out there, you are a Grunt + Node + Angular guru today, tomorrow they will look for a Gulp + TypeScript + React guru, and in 10 years OO GUI building will make a comeback and people will return to writing UI using Swing / MFC like structure as you can run it natively in a browser using ASM.js.<p>I&#x27;m doing web since 2000, and the amount of technology changes is overwhelming, what is hype today, might not be even in existence 10-15 years from now.<p>Programming principles, (OO, Functional, Reactive etc) and basic CS stuff (Algorithms, Data Structures) will likely stay here a little longer.

The linked article says similar about watches: lots of obsession about preserving the elegant mechanical essence...which has practically nothing to do with the <i>reason</i> a watch is bought, that being to tell time. Sure, given a desire to buy a book, or a watch, one may opt for the embossed leather-bound edition printed with a movable-type press, or the 300-component hand-carved self-winding watch, but the driving point is to read The Hobbit, or tell when to leave work.<p>We went thru this with music and photography. Tape & vinyl gave way to CDs which gave way to MP3 & AAC & FLAC. Film gave way to terabyte hard drives & multi-gigabyte flash cards. Sure, there&#x27;s an occasional nostalgic resurgence of vinyl and film, but those technologies are largely relegated to artisan use. I was at Kodak when the photo industry pivoted; it&#x27;s little more than a brand and a mostly-sold patent portfolio now.<p>There&#x27;s the old line that when a news headline asks a yes/no question, the answer is invariably &quot;no&quot;. So...no, the Swiss watchmaker won&#x27;t, on the whole, survive the digital age. The Movado on my desk and the Apple on my wrist cost about the same, but one&#x27;s on my desk and the other is used every few minutes for a variety of purposes (from accurate-to-50ms-and-50m time to up-next calendar to notifications to backup telephone to exercise monitor to mapping to ...). Yeah, the mechanical version (even a mere quartz movement, akin to an old literal-pulp novel) appeals more to the base senses, but given which will actually get near-constant use, well, ask Kodak how their film business is holding up.",1433525308

Best practices are hard to come by, they essentially are: Crockford&#x27;s Javascript The Good Parts, The Mozilla JS docs, and some styleguides on Github. Also lint your code through JSLint or JSHint.<p>3. Don&#x27;t worry about build tools like Brunch, Gulp, Grunt etc. unless your job forces you to use one. If you&#x27;re building small sites and apps, you won&#x27;t need one.<p>4. When it&#x27;s time to use a Framework, pick one and stick to it until you know it quite well.

He was hiring a kid with no real work experience, no degree, no proof he knew what he was talking about besides the pictures of his breadracks in his basement with x86 machines networked and crunching through DES keys for distributed.net (which was the style at the time).<p>Once you get your foot in the door though, the sky is the limit.

I grew up on Simply Scheme (by Brian Harvey and Matt Wright) and SICP. In the mid 90s, python wasn&#x27;t available as an option for me. After using HyperTalk &#x27;92-&#x27;95, learning Scheme was enlightening, and it was my language of choice &#x27;96-&#x27;04. Then I found python in &#x27;04, which addressed the &quot;thicket of incompatible implementations&quot; problems Scheme had and provided more powerful data structures (list and dict) out of the box.

9666588,comment,9665945,9666479,0,0,yojo,,,"Thanks! Also, appreciate the bug report.<p>Re React v Angular:<p>Before Angular I was coming from knockoutjs, and most of Angular made sense to me pretty immediately out of the box. It felt very quick to get going.<p>The community/tooling around it was also pretty great. For example, angular-material is miles ahead of material-ui (the most popular react material UI framework).  I&#x27;ve definitely missed having access to so many great off the shelf libraries.<p>The downsides were mainly around architecture; we ended up littering state all over the place as a result of two-way bindings, and it always felt a little like we were missing an important abstraction. Even on an MVP, it started to feel like we were nervous about touching components because we weren&#x27;t sure what would break elsewhere in the system.<p>Flux stores/dispatcher is that abstraction we were missing. We&#x27;ve made an effort to follow the model closely with all of our DB data and it pays off wonderfully. The code is easier to reason about and I have more confidence about which changes could produce downstream effects.<p>The downside is following the pattern tightly requires a whole lot of boiler plate. For simple things like flipping a bit in a component in response to a user action, angular was incredibly easy. Doing it following the Flux pattern is much less so (dom element calls a callback in the component which calls an action creator which calls the dispatcher which is listened to buy a store which is observed by the component..). In Angular you touch two files with one line of code, with React the same change might involve changes across five or six files with a lot more boilerplate.<p>I do think that extra work pays for itself in future maintenance costs, but for a scrappy start up trying to move fast, it can at times feel painful.<p>Which brings me to testing; The short answer is: we don&#x27;t. I think testing is important for a product with an established user base. I think it&#x27;s less important when you&#x27;re trying to get an MVP out there to see what people think. We know that what we showed today will need to change, we&#x27;re just not sure how yet. Assuming that pretty much everything in the product will churn in the next six months, setting up a robust test suite felt too expensive for the value it returns. As the product consolidates we&#x27;ll fill in tests, but not while the feature churn is as high as it is.",1433523807

Changing the price point significantly may dramatically affect the market you&#x27;re aiming at and the expectations of that market. Your product might have mass appeal but only as a casual/impulse purchase (typical mobile app). Your product might have only niche appeal but to the right market of people who appreciate it, it could be worth a fortune (original works by famous artists sometimes sell for more money than most of us will earn in a lifetime). To make things more challenging, it can also be relatively difficult to test different pricing levels.",1433523764

That is one problem you will never have.<p>You may also never have to use DTrace with the Linux versions of 1Password, Adium, Audio Hijack, Automator, Colloquy, GarageBand, Handbrake, Path Finder, Pixelmator, Quicksilver, NetNewsWire, Snapz Pro, Textmate, Transmit, Twitterific, VisualHub, or xScope. To say nothing of Photoshop or Logic Pro. Just think of all the bugs you will never have to find.<p>Of course, based on a quick Google search for ""dtrace Linux"", you don't seem to be able to run DTrace on Linux at all. But, if you could, I'm sure it would be perfect!<p></snark><p>Mind you, I love Linux and I use it all the time. Just not on my desktop.",1200863967

These Gulf countries are (and have always been, but moreso now) willing to pay a lot of money (tax free) along with a boatload of benefits to experienced westerners who would work with them. It's hard to turn that down when you have children who one day will go to private American universities, etc.",1200863737

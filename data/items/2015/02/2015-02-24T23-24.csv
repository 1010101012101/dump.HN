So not only is GPG not &quot;good enough&quot;, but using it today makes your life worse than it was before.  There are places where using GPG can lead to death or torture, even if the message is simply your grocery list.<p>In order for GPG (or its replacement) to fulfill the dream, it needs to be the norm rather than the exception.  There are some companies who could prod things in that direction.  GPG acting alone is absolutely not the future.<p>Besides, the cryptography isn&#x27;t even very good.  There is no forward secrecy, for example.  I believe that email has to change at the protocol level in order to fulfill the promise that GPG (PGP) makes.  And with so many interested in preventing the security of email, well, it seems like secure email is a dead end.  And that&#x27;s a real shame, because I love the idea of being able to securely send a message between two people on the Internet, using open source software and without trusting any intermediates.",1424822383

Some nodes represent things on screen, some represent actions. You literally connect them to eachother (connect my swipe node to my feed node) to prototype your UI. You use origami in the same way you setup a modular synth, or use something like pure-data or MaxMSP. The end result is a UI prototype.<p>2) FramerJS is a javascript-based prototyping tool that has a DSL for programming the prototypes. You are very much writing javascript <i>code</i> to simulate the real interactions the user might have with your interface.<p>That&#x27;s the <i>big</i> difference. If you are familiar with Javascript, you will certainly have an easier time writing code in Framer to represent animation and interactions (it will also translate more easily to final production code because in theory the algorithms for the interactions are similar). If you have no programming background (or just feel at ease with visual programming), you may prefer Origami.<p>(They&#x27;re both great tools, and despite being quite accustomed to the latest Framer versions, I&#x27;m going to try out Origami 2.0 too.

3) CT describes abstract patterns in maths, and is therefore directly applicable to everyday programming.
4) (Exposition of Categories, Functors, Monoids)
5) Comparison of the mathematical concepts to equivalent programming concepts
6) Composability is a huge advantage for software in the large and the small; categories and monoids capture the essence of composable patterns.
7) Abstraction is hugely important for software; it allows to only know what we need, and no more. Category Theory gives us deeper, and dare I say, simpler abstractions. We can find underlying patterns and commonalities that we might have missed otherwise.",1424822003

Great UX takes lots of design and iteration, which means someone has to pay for all those designers and front end devs. However, when you want good encryption, user experience always comes after security, which means you spend the majority of your resources on the security, not the design.

Another is that changes in SV ethos have made companies less hospitable to women. It&#x27;s probably a combination of many different effects.<p>> I still feel like we must be missing something.<p>Probably lots of things. What troubles me is the pervasive lack of curiosity and lack of empathy. You see people here on HN drool over sci-fi notions of cryonics or believe all sorts of scientific &quot;findings&quot; of dubious nature about nutrition, but dismiss all attempts to really understand this issue. You also see people here express such decisive opinions about pretty much anything, but when a woman tells of a negative experience at a SV company, the responses turn into, &quot;wait, we have to wait and hear the other side first&quot;.<p>If we realize this is important -- and I have more to say about this point -- and investigate this in depth, then I think we will have benefitted already. In the meantime, we should take it to heart that employees in our industry feel distressed by the working environment we create.<p>Now, why is it so important? Many people confuse sexism and racism with mere discrimination between sexes/races, or unequal representation in various professions. But that women are underrepresented in the waste-disposal industry does not make anyone lose sleep. The reason is that sexism and racism are all about power[2] (the academic shorthand for racism/sexism is &quot;discrimination + power&quot;. It is a very serious problem when groups of the population are absent or underrepresented in seats of power, and when that happens, it requires investigation (the assumption being that no group would freely yield power -- over itself -- to others). Because the tech industry, and Silicon Valley in particular, pack so much power these days, and since we share this power and can influence its future, we should be very concerned to learn that we&#x27;re distributing this power unfairly.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-wom...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)</a>",1424821234

FCC orders are not released in preliminary form before they are approved. This is consistent with regulatory agency decisions in general, there is a formal process for release of orders, that involves approval. Certain orders are released as proposals for comment before being finalized -- this is called a &quot;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&quot; (NPRM). The FCC did, in fact, issue an NPRM on its open internet rules, which (along with the public comment on the NPRM) got plenty of notice here, in the mainstream media, etc.<p>After comment on an NPRM, the agency reviews the comments, conducts further policy discussions, and can either abandon the effort, revise the policy and issue it as an order or issue a new, revised NPRM. All of these -- except abandoning the effort entirely -- require the agency to conduct a vote.<p>Regulatory agencies don&#x27;t release draft orders prior to vote of the agency (as distinct from NPRMs, which, while they aren&#x27;t final orders, are final <i>products</i> of the agency, not pre-vote drafts) much the same way that courts don&#x27;t release draft opinions before the judges have voted on them.",1424821181

9104257,comment,9098501,9103655,0,0,stifledissent,,,"I will post here a response to a reply that was briefly posted but then deleted.<p>> Gas chambers did exist<p>There were definitely delousing chambers that no mainstream historian denies were used to control the typhus epidemic. If you call those gas chambers, fine. Generally, when this topic is being discussed, &quot;gas chambers&quot; is a shorthand for homicidal gas chambers. IF you have evidence for those, please show.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if you think I am deliberately trying to twist things. I&#x27;m not. Yes, there were many camps. Out of all the concentration camps, only these camps in Poland are nowadays said to have housed homicidal gas chambers: Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka etc (etc being Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno). Also of notice is that only those camps liberated by the Soviets are said today to have housed gas chambers. Right after the war, and for quite some time, it was said there were gas chambers in Dachau and in all the 17 german camps. Today no mainstream historian argues that no german camp had ever housed gas chambers.<p>Indeed some camps were transit camps, like Treblinka, even though Arad himself (a prominent mainstream jewish holocaust historian) argues in his book that Treblinka was a death camp, and that all who arrived were killed within 15 minutes. This can be easily dismissed by listening to the testimonies themselves, many of which relate that they stopped at Treblinka, took a shower, re-entered the trains and headed to other camps; we also have tons of photos of train tickets showing Treblinka as a transit camp.<p>Yes, we have eyewitness testimony. Have you looked into them yourself? I have. We can talk about it after you do. The testimonies are entirely exaggerated and have no basis in reality. Dario Gabbai, a self-alleged Sonderkommando (the folks that allegedly operated the gas chambers), said he would cut the hair of the &quot;gassed victims&quot; after they were gassed. He said the victims would turn black and blue, and he&#x27;d walk inside the chamber, treading over the corpses, to cut their hair after the fact. I can link you the video to Dario Gabbai himself saying these things but it&#x27;s on Youtube. This is in direct contradiction with what we know from pictures happened, namely that they had their hair cut as a life-saving measure to avoid typhus through hair lice, which was done, obviously, before they shwoered, and not after they were &quot;gassed&quot;.<p>Regarding Prussic acid, it is a mainstream fact that 95% of all Zyklon-B was used for delousing purposes. The exterminationists have to try and explain the death of 6 million people with only 5% of the available Zyklon-B. Regarding engine exhaust, if you read Pressac, who was a &quot;holocaust denier&quot; (to use your terms) but converted to being an exterminationist, you will see the story about the engine exhaust is very hard to explain and has several technical problems. It is variedly told to be a submarine engine, a Soviet tank diesel engine (which doesn&#x27;t work for gassing), etc, while no evidence of such engine has ever been found. Plus, it seems a rather ad hoc method for the exterminationists to tout, when usually they defend there was a policy of <i>systematic</i> killing.<p>I don&#x27;t believe millions of Jews were killed, because no one has bothered to put together a cogent case for the logistics thereof. Pressac in his book about the operations of the gas chambers attempts to do just that and comes incredibly short of it. I&#x27;m definitely interested in that evidence so if you come across it, please send it my way. One of the reasons I got interested in this topic was precisely because the purported method of killing was so dehumanizing and so fantastical that I wanted to know the details. Then I found out there are no details being put forward by the exterminationists.<p>If there were a cogent case to be made about the holocaust, it would have been made during the trial where Sylvia Stolz worked. The person she was defending was being accused of &quot;denying the holocaust&quot; when no forensic definition for &quot;holocaust&quot; exists. There is no case that can be constructed to define what the holocaust was because it is based entirely on second-hand hearsay and dubious stories of supposed participants that do not match the reality of the events.",1424820219

For instance, whether the subject frames a choice as a loss or a smaller-than-expected gain. So, no matter how you define a utility function, it will not always be maximized.<p>I disagree, I think you are assuming that people accept questions at face value and unfailingly trust the experimenter. Then equivalent but differently-stated problems would be equivalent, and you would reach that conclusion.<p>But when people use heuristics, those heuristics are grounded in their experience, and are like a prior on the meaning of the question. Stating the same question in two different ways and getting different answers means either that there is no utility function, or that the &quot;utility function&quot; depends (through model uncertainty, for example) on the exact phrasing of the question.<p>My point is that these discussions are very closely tied to the kinds of assumptions you make about how people reason, what is rational, and what inputs the utility function has. Kahneman and Tversky got around this problem, I think, by doing something eminently reasonable: postulating a clear and unambiguous definition of a utility function.

This exemption is not automatic and must be claimed by filing an affidavit with the Court when you are notified that the creditor intends to request a wage garnishment. If you properly claim the exemption, your wages cannot be garnished by a judgment creditor if you are head of the family and your wages are $750 per week or less. If you are a head of family and your wages exceed $750 per week, they can only be garnished by a judgment creditor if you have agreed in writing that the creditor can garnish your wages.

It lays an elaborate case before the reader, detailing the woeful state of NASA interplanetary science and the assumed perfidy of a stingy congress.<p>This is a narrative that has only the slimmest hold on reality. Congress has done reasonably well at keeping NASA funded, with some occasional road bumps here and there. And certainly at a lower level than what many of us who value planetary exploration particularly highly would like. But still not too bad all things considering.<p>The real cause for the pinch in planetary science is NASA itself. It has indulged in undisciplined budgetary behavior and project planning at the cost of diversity and robustness in its science missions.<p>The major cause of these problems is something that is not mentioned once, even in passing, in this entire article: the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). As of right now JWST is more than $7 billion over budget and 8 years behind schedule. That $7 billion compares to: 1 Curiosity rover ($2.5 billion) plus 2 Dawn double asteroid rendezvous missions (2x $500 million, 4 total asteroidal bodies visited) plus 1 Cassini mission ($1.4 billion) plus 1 New Horizons mission ($650 million) plus 1 Kepler mission ($550 million) plus an entire extra billion dollars. That&#x27;s an exciting panoply of opportunities, and imagine those figures in the context of similar classes of missions. Ion engine powered comet-survey missions, planetary landers and rovers, Kuiper belt flyby missions, survey missions to Neptune and Uranus, exo-planet searches, and so forth. To say that NASA&#x27;s space science missions have been sucked dry of funding is to ignore <i>why</i> and toward what end they have been.<p>Make no mistake, JWST is a remarkably ambitious mission that is likely to be as groundbreaking as Hubble was, but it is absolutely squeezing the life out of the rest of NASA right now. It would be nice if congress would provide even more funding for NASA so they could go forward with JWST as well as other missions, but to implicate congress as a villain depriving NASA space science of life is to ignore the reality of the situation. This is a self-inflicted wound.<p><a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/08/science/la-sci-sn-aas-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-astrophysics-budget-20130108"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/08/science/la-sci-sn-aa...</a><p><a href=""http://blogs.agu.org/martianchronicles/2012/02/14/proposed-nasa-budget-cuts-mars-exploration-by226/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.agu.org/martianchronicles/2012/02/14/proposed-n...</a><p>P.S.

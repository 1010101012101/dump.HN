Runaway inflation is of course a bad thing, but no inflation at all, or deflation, is just as bad in economic terms.<p>Consider where that initial cash came from. You worked your ass off between 18 and 60 and you got a bunch of cash in exchange. Some you spent on consumption, some you saved for use later. In fact, cash is just &#x27;tokens for exchange later&#x27; where later is a time window that varies from 1 hour (hand-to-mouth) to 50+ years (surplus productive capacity people).<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if you could use your tokens for their promised exchange-value through your retirement and see those years of hard work payoff? In fact, multiply, because as you said the population grows, more goods are produced, and your cash tokens buy more and more of those goods.<p>It&#x27;s a great way to retire. Unfortunately for the retired, they are on fixed incomes (pensions) in an inflationary world: those people get SCREWED to the extent where they can&#x27;t afford heating in some US States.<p>These are people who worked hard all their lives and just wanted to live off the proceeds, the surplus they had generated.<p>Think of the chi^H^H^H grandparents!",1392886616

SAT scores and college GPAs were obtained from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Subjects were classified as high or low ability by g factor scores from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. SAT correlations with GPA were higher for high than low ability subjects. SAT g loadings (i.e., SAT correlations with g) were equivalent for both groups. This is the first study to show that the predictive validity of the SAT varies for ability groups that differ in g. The results contradict a presumption, based on Spearman’s Law of Diminishing Returns, that a test’s predictive validity should be lower for high ability subjects. Further research is needed to identify factors that contribute to the predictive validity of the SAT for groups that differ in g.<i>",1392886493

Sure, now you get them everywhere, but I don’t think standard smartphone contracts had them four years ago. You had to pay obscenely more (something like double the monthly cost) if you could get unlimited SMS at all. I remember that the high cost of SMS were a real sticking point for my sister.<p>In my experience smartphone contracts in Germany tended to be much cheaper than in the US but you would also get substantially less for your money. That’s still the case today with included unthrottled data volume.<p>So maybe that’s one reason why Whatsapp took off. Another one I can think of is that Germany is less of an iOS monoculture than the US. Android is more widespread, so iMessage frequently gets you no benefit at all.",1392886345

It&#x27;s the facebook of messengers (now it&#x27;s just facebook...). In most of Europe an Africa there&#x27;s a 90% chance , that your friend with a smartphone has also WhatsAp installed. Even the older generation (40+) uses it frequently. In Africa, they even have a song about it [1].<p>2. Cross-Platform: It&#x27;s available on most common smartphone platforms and looks almost identical across these. There are no hassles of sending stuff (videos, locations) across these platforms. Changing your smartphone is not a problem as long as you keep the same number.<p>3. It feels snappy: In comparison to iMessage, FB Messenger it&#x27;s fast and has no disturbing gimmicks. You see messages instantly and it feels like a chat when iMessages feels more like bloated sms...<p>4. It works in places with unreliable network like rural regions. iMessages fails here often, FB apps also need a stable connection to work properly.<p>5. A few years ago unlimited text plans were not as common as in the US. Because of this people looked for an alternative to paying ~19c per text (EU). WhatsApp was one of the most polished solutions with a low entry barrier.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFkpVrC2sw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFkpVrC2sw</a>",1392885187

Landing and taking off involve some subtle things that most simulators don&#x27;t capture, like the fact that in a small propeller-drive plane, at slow speed, the propeller torque twists the body of the airplane, so you have to apply some counter-rudder to straighten out the fuselage and maximize climbing efficiency.<p>And landing has risks that simulators certainly don&#x27;t capture, like the all-too-common stall-spin on final approach, which turns out to represent a high percentage of all GA accidents. Most simulators won&#x27;t even imitate this common problem -- in most simulators you can&#x27;t force the plane into a spin, either at altitude or while landing. That by itself might make a student overconfident about how much he&#x27;s learned.<p>In reality, a student or new pilot turns too slow on final, realizes he&#x27;s not lined up, so he banks too steeply and applies some aggressive rudder, which causes the inboard wing to stall, then unless the pilot knows exactly what to do and does it instantly, the plane will stall-spin, do a 1/4 turn and hit the ground before an inexperienced pilot can react. A very common accident scenario.",1392884121

I guess he likes to use <i>self.var</i> rather than <i>var</i> - but it&#x27;s important to note that this does have some performance implications.<p><i>> 4. Modularize and model.</i><p>I&#x27;ll give you 4 though - using compiler recognizable types is always a boon. I&#x27;m not sure if anybody really needs to be told to modularize and model, most people would understand that without being told. It does lock-in your public API though, making changes to a library require updating all apps that use the library. Meanwhile, adding a new field into a dict means existing apps can upgrade the library easily. Still, I&#x27;d definitely agree that types are always a better bet in the long run.",1392883263

Everything it does will be with the singular purpose of making more paperclips. Not music, math, sport, culture or anything else that we think of as good. Not &quot;help save intelligent creatures and animals from death&quot;. Only one goal - making more paperclips.<p>And if it decides that the optimal way to make paperclips just happens to involve death and destruction to humanity, that won&#x27;t matter.<p>So yes, the AI might be more intelligent, but I still wouldn&#x27;t want to trade humanity for an intelligence which <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> do anything I value.",1392883258

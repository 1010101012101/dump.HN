The store is illuminated and HVAC by natgas and coal.  The delivery truck from the warehouse doesn&#x27;t burn biodiesel and isn&#x27;t made of soy.  The warehouse burns lots of coal for its HVAC and lights.  The trucks delivering to the warehouse don&#x27;t run on biodiesel and aren&#x27;t made of soy.  Assuming produce and not &quot;processed food-like substances&quot; the farm uses diesel to run the tractor and other gear, some coal powered electricity in the greenhouse, fertilizers made of phosphates dug out of the ground (what to do when they run out?) and nitrates made by the haber process outta lots of natgas.  Also there may or may not be herbicides / pesticides / fertilizers made out of crude oil.<p>If your food is cheaper per &quot;gallon&quot; than diesel, its at least theoretically possible to make it with biodiesel and be net energy positive.  If it takes 20 gallons of diesel equivalent environmental damage to make a gallon of walnut oil, then if you poured walnut oil into a biodiesel tank the system would rapidly run dry and halt.<p>Computer science types have a stereotype where the &quot;halting problem&quot; can&#x27;t be solved for them so it can&#x27;t be solved anywhere, although energy calculations are actually pretty simple (yes yes I know totally different type of halting its a bad joke).  If (Energy Returned) is less than (Energy Invested) then the only way to keep pumping food out is to burn crude oil to make up the difference.<p>Depending what axe you have to grind, EROEI of food varies from 0.1 to 1.  The truth is probably within that range, perhaps 0.3.  A pound of fat (animal hydrocarbon, basically) is worth 3500 or so calories so the environment is better off if you burn two pounds of gasoline than if you eat a pound of food (aka equivalent of 3 pounds of diesel burned to make it) and bike the same distance.",1389621060

I figured its total lifetime cost including gas and what little maintenance it needed at thirty five grand.  So figure about 20 cents per mile.  That&#x27;s cheaper than average, then again it was more of a beater of an old car that most would tolerate.  Mechanically fine, but cosmetically a mess.  So yes twenty cents per mile is not totally ridiculous.<p>Being a purely recreational biker I suspect I&#x27;ve only got 1K or so miles on my &quot;Giant&quot; bike from 1992.  It was about $300 but the way tires decay (why so much faster than car?) and general minor repairs I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m in for $500 by now.  So I&#x27;m paying 50 cents per mile, or about 2.5 times more than my commuter car costs the environment.<p>Worst of all, being a recreational bike, I&#x27;ve caused $500 worth of environmental destruction just for fun when I could have meditated or bird watched or gone hiking.  And if you get rid of the recreational bikers, that&#x27;s a large market segment so costs and enviro-damage will increase.  Aside from the obvious win of get rid of recreational bikers, well, they&#x27;ll just drive to the mall with their new spare time or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could game the numbers and if I had a recreational car and a commuter bike the numbers could be made to look different.  One problem with a commuter bike is the weather only cooperates about 1/3 of the year, and my car goes easily six times faster than my bike, making the commute punishingly impossible.",1389620051

With Clojure, special forms like def, if, etc, provide syntax in that each one has different rules for how their arguments get evaluated or, in the case of def, how the environment is changed. On top of that, you have macros which allow you to introduce arbitrary syntax.<p>However, all Clojure code does have the same uniform structure. It&#x27;s all composed of s-expressions, which are either atoms or other s-expressions enclosed in parentheses (for lists), braces (for maps), or brackets (for vectors).<p>Thanks again for this feedback, having to explain this has given me some ideas for how to improve the chapter :)",1389619797

7050360,comment,7049668,7049668,5,0,PaulRobinson,,,"Predictions are basically hopes. When you look at them rationally, they are rarely based on facts but intuition. On this list:<p><i>1. More than $100M of venture capital will flow into Bitcoin start-ups.</i><p>No it won&#x27;t because if you ask VCs they will mostly tell you that the value can not be extracted easily into fiat currency and that&#x27;s what they need to still work in.<p>To that argument, some will say &quot;BTC-only VCs&quot; will emerge which is a regulatory nightmare, so would be restricted to angels only, or that the money will flow into making BTC<->Fiat exchange easier, but that needs buy-in from the banks, and the moment they decide it&#x27;s safe to do, they&#x27;ll just do it themselves so there is no market for it.<p>Investing in BTC startups is a risky business as it is. Putting $100mm into them would be seen by the VC industry as positively insane.<p><i>2. Mining ‘will not’ be dead</i><p>If you run the numbers, it&#x27;s of marginal profitability at best right now (and in most legal use cases is a negative - you need to steal power from somewhere, basically), and the miners aren&#x27;t doing their maths very well. The poster&#x27;s opinion that smaller enterprises will move their mining out to the cloud means they haven&#x27;t done the maths either.<p><i>3. There will be less than 5 alt-coins (out of the 50+ in existence) that will survive 2014</i><p>This made me laugh. The fact alt-coins exist at all shows how the value of BTC is being misunderstood by both sides of the &quot;is this tulipmania or a revolution?&quot; debate.<p>The advantage of BTC is that it&#x27;s a decentralised &quot;currency&quot; based on open source algorithms and a network of workers validating itself, which can be easily replicated.<p>The disadvantage of BTC is it&#x27;s a decentralised &quot;currency&quot; based on open source algorithms and a network of workers validating itself, which can be easily replicated.<p>It&#x27;s biggest strength is also it&#x27;s biggest weakness.<p>If you can&#x27;t see that strength as a massive weakness, ask yourselves what value BTC intrinsically has over other alt-coins.<p>If you follow that argument down the inevitable rabbit hole you will eventually rationalise that the value is based on perception, much like fiat currencies of the modern era, and you will start hankering for the gold standard.<p>Except the perception of fiat currencies is so strong it is unlikely to be undermined by the majority. Is that true of BTC?<p>In essence, BTC will remain strong as long as people believe it will remain strong. But the moment the majority flip, or switch to an alt-coin like Litecoin, etc. then what value will it retain?<p><i>4. Bitcoin community will solve problems including that of ‘anonymity’</i><p>Anonymity is not the problem banks and governments are truly concerned about. If it were, cash would be phased out by governments just as much as BTC would be blocked. In general they are undecided but wary of BTC because it has all the hallmarks of a Ponzi scheme with mysterious founders who do not make their intentions known.<p>It is accountability of the system that is of concern, not accountability of the transactions within it.<p><i>5. US, China and other global forces will not be at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption</i><p>If you think that the US, China and other countries are &quot;global forces&quot; you need to look at corporate entities more and ask who has the money and who has the debt.<p>Either way, the fact that BTC could be a private currency that lets corporations run free from government control and &quot;tyrannical&quot; central banks is just going to force more legislation outlawing BTC transactions.<p><i>6. Indian ecosystem will be slow to evolve; limited to speculators and mining pools</i><p>As indeed will the rest of the World. There are no pure consumers in the BTC space - everybody in the BTC ecosystem right now is a miner or a speculator or both, and the transactions are a side effect of suddenly having a lot of &quot;money&quot; that can&#x27;t be easily turned into fiat currency.<p>There are few people - if any at all - who are using BTC because they perceive it as better for day to day transactions than fiat currency, because for the most part it is not.<p><i>7. The use of Bitcoin will evolve beyond ‘store of value’ or ‘transactions’</i><p>Adding metadata to the BTC blockchain is mildly interesting. Using the protocol for other purposes outside of the BTC transaction block chain (messaging, etc.) is much more interesting.<p>I have no doubt that the true value of BTC is the protocol that might inspire all sorts of wonderful P2P applications to emerge, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear right now that any of them still lasting in 10-20 years will be currency.<p><i>8. The ‘browser’ of Bitcoin will come this year</i><p>By definition if you make a system easier to use, you have to make it less secure. If this happens, we can expect many more &quot;somebody stole my BTC because I left my web browser open&quot; stories.<p>Banks serve a useful purpose with BTC: they keep money safe. BTC needs something like banks to emerge, and that defeats part of the point of BTC.<p>And of course, it&#x27;s virtually impossible for BTC banks to operate because they can&#x27;t provide interest (BTC is designed to be anti-inflationary, and therefore by definition the concept of interest is hard to fit into the scheme of things), so people will either need to continue to struggle or we&#x27;ll see value being stolen regularly.<p><i>9. The price of Bitcoin is likely to range between $4000-5000 by the end of 2014</i><p>You could literally use a RNG to come up with predictions for 2014 highs this year on BTC. Here are 10 I just came up with, and all of them are equally valid: $0, $12, $87, $479, $2065, $3535, $5566, $9233, $65136, $72612. Pick one, it&#x27;s your prediction for the year. Well done.<p>And it&#x27;s that uncertainty that is driven by the fact the whole damned thing has so little liquidity and so much &quot;value&quot; is being sat on by speculators who could start a rush in under an hour, that makes it so hard for people to see BTC as viable long-term.<p>That then causes the effect that it is unlikely to ever become viable long-term.<p><i>10.

We hunkered down for 6 weeks and got something horrible but workable out of the door 2 years ago...<p>As for implications:<p>- Splitting development time between the product and the clients has been hard but gets easier as our clients get used to it. We book in sprints of work on Staff Squared in our schedules way in advance. I line up two solid weeks for the entire team every quarter and this time is sacred. No amount of customer complaints get us to move this time. The amount of time I block out increases with the growth of the app. There&#x27;s a constant backlog of minor tweaks, so if any of the team find themselves at a loose end they always revert to the Staff Squared backlog (We use a trello/harvest combo for managing this).<p>- Managing sales - our office manager has stepped in to help the onboarding and sales but ultimately as CEO of Atlas  I&#x27;ve done the lion share of this work. This has meant a lot of overtime on my part but tbh I enjoy the work. Given that our aim is to transition in to a product company that does a bit of consultancy on the side (as opposed to a service company with a couple of products) this is short term pain I&#x27;m more than happy to experience.<p>- Staff development - One of our programmers wasn&#x27;t performing incredibly well in her position as a programmer. She&#x27;s always had an artistic flair that a lot of programmers aren&#x27;t blessed with, and so I decided to take a punt and move her on to Staff Squared full time to help me with marketing and UX. She&#x27;s transformed beyond recognition and now my right hand woman when it comes to making changes to the Staff Squared app UI.<p>- Using the products as a sales tool. I hoped this would happen...we&#x27;re not usually able to show/tell potential customers what we&#x27;ve worked on before to any level of detail as it&#x27;ll breach confidentiality. Not so with our products (we also have www.fundipedia.com). If a potential client wants to see what we&#x27;re capable of we ask them to sign up to Staff Squared and kick the tyres as it were. This has actually resulted in more Staff Squared customers too. Double whammy!<p>- We&#x27;ve had to drop any customers not willing to pay our full day rate (some were offered discounts back in the day which we haven&#x27;t been able to readdress). With those customers gone, and Staff Squared out there as an example of what we&#x27;re capable of, newer, bigger and better customers have arrived for Atlas and we&#x27;re now fully booked for pretty much all of 2014. I have no doubt this huge upturn in customer work is as a direct result of our pushing our own products forward.<p>- The development team are happier than they&#x27;ve ever been. They get to work on an app they&#x27;re incredibly passionate about (inbetween client work) and see the direct results of their actions in the form of more paying customers. It&#x27;s a great tool to incentivise a team of people who are already very well looked after individually.<p>I hope that helps, if you have any specific questions I&#x27;d be happy to answer them.",1389619370

If anything, I would turn it around and say that being a founder and having a family is like trying to have your cake and eat it too, which is not realistic. Delayed gratification is one of the prevailing signs of maturity, and postponing settling down and starting a family until after establishing a business would be a clear example of it. And someone who consistently works very long hours is if anything serious.<p>We can argue these points all day, but the reality is, unless you can provide evidence that founders with families possess these attributes in measurably greater quantities, and with statistically significant higher probability of success, whether or not having a family is an asset or not in achieving success with a startup is purely subjective.<p>On the other hand, the number of available working hours, and how more work will result in greater likelihood of success is pretty objective. There may be diminishing returns as the number of hours increase, but at least up to a pretty high point, those returns will still be positive.",1389618700

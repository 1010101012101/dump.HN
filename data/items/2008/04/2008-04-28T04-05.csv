The big metric in the pilot industry is flight time, and in 150 days you can't get enough flight time to compete with the lifelong pilots.<p>A good course for many people is to go right into instruction. That way you make some money while building flight time on someone else's dime. This is actually how it works at ERAU. The Juniors and Seniors train the others.<p>Also, a private license is closer to $10,000 now, mostly because of fuel prices. It used to be a cool $6000 though.<p>To go from 0 to being able to earn money flying (commercial license) will cost about $20,000 last I checked.",1209358711

175341,comment,174859,175264,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Nor can we accurately quantify the genetic contribution in the first place.</i><p>It depends. Some things are discrete (eg, genetic diseases like huntington's).  Most things are on a continuum--there's no IQ gene, for instance. I suspect that, in a rough way, almost every non-junk aspect of the human genome has some effect on intelligence, large or small.<p>The best tests are perhaps still separated twin studies. Identical DNA + different environments makes for a convenient way to quantify the genetic influence of characteristics...<p>Of course, once genetic engineering is in full bloom, all of this will be quite non-controversial.",1209358671

He also covers the DOM, which is intrinsic to working with AJAX.<p><a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/</a><p>Start with ""The JavaScript Programming Language"", and then do ""Advanced JavaScript"" and finally ""An Inconvenient API: The Theory of the DOM"" (the latter two can stand alone, and if you're in a hurry, maybe get the DOM out of the way).  That plus spending some time with Firebug and a few interesting JavaScript applications (and building some of my own) has been the entirety of my JavaScript education.  I bought the ""Definitive Guide"" from O'Reilly, but haven't used it heavily.<p>There are other useful videos on the same page, including one with Joe Hewitt introducing Firebug.  I can't stress enough how helpful Firebug has been in helping me learn JavaScript and AJAX.<p>Note that I haven't talked much about AJAX.  AJAX is a tiny piece of JavaScript, but in order to build useful applications you need to know a lot more than AJAX.  So, learn JavaScript and AJAX will come naturally.<p>As others have mentioned, the good frameworks make dealing with browsers easier, since it hides compatibility issues as well as some of the complexity.  Mainly a framework just allows you to spend more time thinking about your specific needs rather than the tedious plumbing work of getting stuff happening on the page.",1209358510

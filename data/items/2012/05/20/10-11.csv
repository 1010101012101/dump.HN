3998489,comment,3995185,3996196,2,0,cturner,,,"Users need to be able to get the functions they need. But the unix-way provides a mechanism for getting ls plus the functionality you want: have a shell macro run the minimalist ls and pipe it through a formatter.<p>Unfortunately, although unix scripting was good by the standard of its era, it's still not particularly good. Unix as we know it hints at great ideals that are achievable but lives up to them poorly. As a result, early packagers shoveled hacks into existing layers and we live with the result.<p>Evidence: arguments in commands like cat and ls; the crudeness of ps to represent the process table; inability for scripts to access unix systems calls; kitchen sink shell interpreters.<p>Why do we look to shell interpreters for command-line history? That should be done in a separate layer closer to the terminal. Had it been, we'd have two small unbloaty layers. Instead we have tcsh, bash and zsh.<p>You could have your ls formatting macros live in your personal terminal emulator and you'd never need to copy .bashrc hacks to each system. The formatter code might not even live on the remote system, it might be part of the terminal.<p>I suspect you could lay [racket scheme] + [a transform that converts python style whitespace code into parens code] over a unix that has /proc, and use that to create the layers you needed. With that in place, you could then start taking noise out of the unix tools and work towards a smaller distribution.<p>Plan9 is talked of as ""unix done right"" but I'm not convinced. Some things it does well, but it has lots of baggage. For example, you have to buy into their desktop to access the OS. How is forcing me to use a mouse and a particular tiling window manager a necessary part of a better unix experience?<p>I'd like to play with a plan9 fork where the only user interface assumption was a terminal, and where you could get a secure connection into that terminal. (Too inept to do it myself so far, but keep playing with idea of running it on linux, ssh'ing to linux as the jump box, and then telnetting into the plan9 instance. Still - what a hassle)",1337511305

Indeed, the architecture of RACS is quite similar to Tahoe-LAFS, with a proxy server that sends shares of data to different cloud providers.  With RACS, we focused on fault tolerance rather than malicious modification of data:  Cloud providers have their own internal redundancy, so they (hopefully) protect their users from low-level hardware failures... but a company itself can fail, or even raise prices suddenly which can lead to an ""economic failure"", where the user's application becomes prohibitively expensive to run.  So RACS is intended to protect against things like this.  It can tolerate malicious modification of data shares on individual cloud providers, but that kind of security wasn't our focus, so it's interesting to see that Tahoe-LAFS takes that direction.",1337510101

If they're incorrectly pricing the IPO, surely they should suffer for it and adjust their pricing models and strategies rather than be allowed to manipulate their way around what's pretty much their own mistake?<p>I don't know much about how companies go public but it sounds like a good portion of the stock is issued to ""investors"" at or below the IPO price who then immediately go on to sell that stock to the public when trading is opened?  So the downside of pricing the IPO too low is the company won't receive as much for the shares as they could have.  Presumably just issuing the shares directly to the public during the IPO seems like the way to capture the best price?  Is the problem that the exchange doesn't allow for the issuing of shares, only the trading of shares, so somebody needs to own them first?

The Delta Clipper and Clementine vetrans that I met were also frequently Apollo vetrans. Brilliant, passionate engineers, but almost totally devoid of financial resources, and obviously nearing the end of their careers, if not their lives. At 19 years old I was the youngest person in the room by several decades. WIRED was regularly featuring ""rockets"" and ""space exploration"" in it's monthly ""TIRED"" column. I began to fear that the old dream of space -- long fostered by the likes of O'Neil, Von Braun, Oberth, and Tsiolkovsky -- would die with the previous generation, and I was arriving just in time to see its last, heroic gasp.<p>We have turned <i>so</i> many corners since then. The actual rockets are merely the most tangible results of that. What I find even more hopeful is the cultural change. Politicians as disparate as Barack Obama and Dana Rohrabacher are willing to put principles ahead of pork and advocate for the development of a robust commercial space industry. It's now possible to seriously talk about ""space tourism"" without people sniggering derisively and making Marvin the Martian jokes. Investors are no longer cowed by that old saw about how the best way to make a small fortune in space is to start with a large fortune. Some of the largest companies on earth are investing in <i>asteroid mining</i>, for goodness' sake. And most critically, <i>young people</i> are getting truly excited and passionate about this. (It's also extremely gratifying to see women staking out a place in the industry; the old Apollo fraternity was exclusively male.)<p>All in all, I have to say that the progress I've seen in the last two decades of space development is one of the things which most gives me hope for the future.

3998424,comment,3997603,3998177,5,0,shimon_e,,,"You should study some history to understand why western society consider a woman to be owned by her husband. In many tribal religions, before the global spread of Abrahamic religion, had a different concept of what was norm arrangement for a man and woman to have a sexual relationship. For example, in many Arab tribes, women belonged to tents. Men would visit those tents and as long as he financed the tent he could have sexual intercourse with all the females in the tent. Daughter, mother, didn't matter. Men would stay at the tent temporarily. This obviously meant they had no concept of family like how we do. In Abrahamic religions and western society a woman belongs to her husband as opposed to a piece of property. In such a society, women were shunned as if they committed adultery if they refused sex to the man who is currently financing their tent. This was a part of a Persian communism that existed about 2000 years ago. Obviously with the success of Abrahamic religion we kept the terms but forgot the meaning behind the terms. I would love to be able to give more precise details but I haven't reviewed these historical topics since high school.<p>There are some references to what I'm talking about on the wikipeda page on Mazdak. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdak</a>",1337508746

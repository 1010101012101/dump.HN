Many of these schools are expecting lifetime support: they paid a one time $250 fee. It&#x27;s not clear what the legal relationship is between the service provider and the schools either, which may be a problem.<p>So my critique has nothing to do with technical skill, it&#x27;s more that getting &#x27;profitable&#x27; quickly without any consideration of the potential long term debt can be a bad business decision.<p>In my view, these were shaky business decisions (to outsource development, cutting legal corners w schools, one time fees), rather than technical ones, if that makes sense. There are times when outsourcing is the right call, in the context of this particular business I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>Ps. The adequate technical skill to execute is kinda assumed if you&#x27;re founding a tech startup. If it&#x27;s just building a product without the expectation of scaling it you can <i>maybe</i> get with outsourcing. This might be why there&#x27;s more of a discussion on HN about the business side - this is the area that most of the audience here need to develop.<p>I remember reading that YC was founded in the first place with a hypothesis that teaching tech founders the nontech skills (eg. business/communication skills) is far, far more effective than vice versa.

        Process by defining what to do when null.

    Repetition in the form of [x] and Map String x.

We&#x27;re not rich, but we are comfortable and we have jobs that we love.<p>But, there are relatively few of us who end up with permanent research positions in the sciences.  So, let&#x27;s take my field of physics and consider the situation in the US.   Let&#x27;s imagine two tracks for a student.  She&#x27;s skilled in math, computer science, and physics.   She could go into computer science and start working in her field immediately after college.   Depending on where she goes, she could make $100K/yr shortly after graduation (ok, a lot of that may go towards rent, but let&#x27;s just use this as a round number).<p>Now, let&#x27;s suppose that she decides to go the physics route.  She will likely spend 6 years as a PhD student.  Back in my day, I remember making a stipend of $13K/yr.   Checking online, these have now gone up to ~30K/yr at a number of institutions.   So, at the end of 6 years, that&#x27;s already a huge opportunity cost.   She hasn&#x27;t bought a house, she probably has few if any retirement savings.    Now, let&#x27;s suppose that she continues for a postdoc for 3 years.   Let&#x27;s say that she makes $50K/yr (it&#x27;s probably more likely    that she&#x27;ll make $40-$45K/yr, but let&#x27;s again take a round number).   So, at the end of this, she&#x27;s lost $570K of potential earnings.   This is ignoring taxes, but to be fair, it&#x27;s also ignoring any interest growth that she would have made on retirement savings while working for a company.<p>Now, one might argue that for quality of life and doing what she loves, this might be worth it if she became faculty at this point.  However, the chances of this happening are slim.  So, at the end of the day, she&#x27;ll probably examine her options and in many cases (I have had friends and students that have taken different paths to leave physics--ranging from teaching high school to finance) leave physics to do something else.<p>So, the question isn&#x27;t whether it makes sense to do a career in physics vs say a career in CS.  It&#x27;s a question whether it&#x27;s worth the opportunity cost to do a PhD in physics and perhaps a postdoc in physics before doing something completely different.   There are of course some areas of physics where people are able to find industry positions doing physics, but this is often not the case...<p>I think that departments need to be upfront about this and provide students with training opportunities to do other work if they are interested in doing so after their PhD...<p>The calculation may be different for those in engineering fields...",1427516416

This is just a limitation of their system we have to work with.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the &#x27;user&#x27; here in Hosted Chef is not a person, it is an identity in the Chef server that is allowed to upload cookbooks.

I&#x27;d like to address a few things that JSON API gets right, and where it fails horrendously (just in time for 1.0!)<p>The good:<p>- It opens a path for standardized tooling among API clients. Rather than having a whole mess of JSON-over-HTTP clients with a hard-coded understanding of the particular API, one could theoretically use a hypertext client to interact with any API using this standard.<p>- It establishes a baseline of what an API server must implement.<p>The bad:<p>- It tries to control not just the media type, but the protocol (HTTP) and server implementation. This is problematic because it dictates how your server must implement its routes, and is tightly coupled with HTTP.<p>- It tries to be very prescriptive, but it cannot cover all edge cases without being exhaustive. This comes at a heavy burden for implementers to get every part of the specification correct. Despite this, some extremely basic features are missing, such as providing an index document so that a client can enter the API knowing only a single entry point (as it stands now, clients must have a priori knowledge of what resources exist on the server).<p>The ugly:<p>- Since so many parts of the base specification are optional MAYs, and there is no prescribed mechanism for feature detection, there is no way to figure out if a server supports a particular feature of this spec without trying to do something and failing.<p>- The spec has made many breaking changes on the road to 1.0 (as other commenters have mentioned, and there is still room for breaking changes).<p>At this point, I think that this project gained traction due to the clout of the original authors (Yehuda Katz and Steve Klabnik) and the promise of no-more-bikeshedding, though I would argue that the bikeshedding has just shifted from particular APIs to the spec. Disclosure: I authored and maintained some libraries that implement this spec, and authored another media type for hypertext APIs.",1427516241

I&#x27;d say its about 70-30 guys to girls in my comp sci classes, but 65-35 girls to guys in the whole school(Of course no one gives a shit that there is basically 2 girls for every guy in the school). Every week I receive emails from my faculty that are along the lines of &quot;Come to this event to promote women in technology&quot; or &quot;Come participate in this high school event to get girls more interested in technology&quot;. As well the amount of women only benefits is astonishing. This includes numerous scholarships, special tutorials, private talks etc..<p>Anyways the school is fairly well known for its computer science program and has very good connections to the tech industry. If you are top of the class you will most likely get a job at any of the big companies. If you are a girl and around average you will also likely get a job at any of the big companies. This isn&#x27;t to say their are some very talented girls who deserve it.<p>Last thing that I find pretty hilarious. Lets say for example Google is hosting an event where you can ask questions and get to know the recruiters. They will also hold a separate event the next day which is for women only.

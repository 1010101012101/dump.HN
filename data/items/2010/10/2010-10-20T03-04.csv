I believe there are three situations in which a phone call is better than an email. A sales pitch, which would be a gazillion times more efficient if done face to face; a brainstorming conversation, which would be a lot better if it was divided in a solitary work period followed by a cumulative peer based review in person; and when there's a imperative need to switch directions ASAP, which will hinder productivity anyways however you look at it.<p>Of course your millage may vary and I'm not trying to convince you your're wrong, specially because you aren't since this is a a topic very influences by personal preference. I just find that every instance where the telephone could outdo an email, is because either the parties involved where not properly prepared with the required resources in their possession, or because the type of communication was not meant to be written in the first place.

1809876,comment,1809436,1809436,0,0,lzw,,,"Well, since Jim has taken it upon himself to speak on my behalf (""developers want more options "") allow me to rebut:<p>No, Jim. Developers do not want more options. Developers want a well engineered, <i>single</i> platform with excellent development tools and support, so that their code can target hundreds of millions of devices without any customization.  Specifically, developers do not want more ""options"", because every ""option"", which from what I can tell is code for yet-another-me-too-iPhone ripoff with a random screen size and configuration and very limited storage capacity means an order of magnitude more headaches for anyone doing anything more significant than a twitter client (excluding, of course, the really well designed twitter clients who would also have this problem, such as twitteriffic.)<p>Developers want an appstore with reliable terms.  Developers don't want to pay outrageous fees for the ""privilege"" of selling software on your platform.  You may have reformed, by copying apple's better terms, but at least this developer-- who you purport to speak for-- remembers when your terms were disgustingly hostile.  Some developers have a memory.<p>Developers want a store where there are a lot of customers, happy to buy apps, and happy to do business with us. I can't count the number of happy letters I've gotten from satisfied customers. As a developer, I recognize that, while you may copy the appstore, and provide an SDK, you are not providing a developer experience anywhere close to the one Apple provides.  Higher quality tools mean higher quality products and more letters from satisfied customers, and lower developer stress.  What me-too products don't understand is that Apple products are not popular because they look good (the easiest thing for you to copy) they are popular because they work well.  IF you're serious about developers, (and this goes for android as well) you'll start making good developer tools.<p>I do find it hilarious that people try to bash Apple by talking about how Apple doesn't have flash on their platform.  How does? As far as I know adobe still hasn't managed to deliver a version of flash for mobile devices that doesn't suck, and it has been half a year since Steve called them out for it.<p>As to ""customers want to fully access the overwhelming majority of web sites that use Flash"", I have flash blocked in my browser, so this consumer doesn't want access to flash.<p>I must also be navigating the web very carefully since the ""overwhelming majority of websites"" don't seem to have any flash on them at all!<p>""We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple. ""<p>Apple has never told me what to think.  Apple has simply told me what they think.  You are now purporting to tell others what I think, without doing the courtesy of contacting me.<p>""even people inside the distortion field will begin to resent being told half a story.""<p>I've been a fan of Apple since I got an Apple II nearly 30 years ago, and I am pretty sure I first heard the phrase ""reality distortion field"" sometime in the 1980s.   Yet the reality is, I've never heard Apple distort anything.  Apple has never promised me a product that didn't live up to the hype.  Apple has never blatantly ripped off another companies product and pretended like they were innovating, like you have, RIMM.<p>But of course, what is so great about the ""reality distortion field"" phrase is that it is designed to denigrate and marginalize anyone who thinks different.  Anyone who appreciates the extra-ordinary, and apparently beyond duplication effort of Apple to deliver a great customer experience is just a cult member incapable of thinking.<p>So, you'd have us believe that this reality distortion field has caused us to break with the majority, and go seek out a company that your kind has spent decades saying is a failure?<p>Was I imagining it yesterday when an Apple employee went above and beyond the call of duty to fix an issue for me that he didn't have to?   Was it Steve's ""reality distortion field"" that has left me unhappy and feeling dissatisfied with so many competitor products that were purported, and even pretended to be the same thing?  For instance, your poor quoality touch screen devices that you design to look like the iPhone but then cheap out on the hardware and software so it works nothing like the iphone.<p>Who was it engaging in distortion of reality, again?<p>One thing I will say about RIMM.  You did a fantastic job when you named your company.  Perfect name.  Don't ever change it.",1287546382

A friend of a friend's dad whom I have never met randomly called me out of the blue and said he wanted to have lunch with me to discuss some potential web development work.  I went and had lunch with him and he's a great guy - we both went to the same school, same major, captain of the same sport, etc.<p>I can't really get too detailed, but long story short, he and a friend of his have an idea that will satisfy a fairly boring need for a fairly boring industry and as far as they can tell this idea has never been done before.  I was skeptical, so I did my own research and it looks like they might be right.  What makes this venture so interesting is that they legitimately know all of the key players in the industry and can probably rally them all to use this product.<p>He wants a prototype built (which will be pretty simple to do given the requirements he gave me) and eventually it came time to talk about compensation.  He said that I could submit a quote, but he also started to mention that I could do it for ""free"" and have a vested interest (I assume a percentage of ownership) in the venture.  That's about when we parted ways.<p>Here's my question:  How would you negotiate this?  As far as I can tell it's never been done before and I'm confident that they know the right people and would most likely be able to convince them to use this product/service.  I'll be doing most of the grunt work (design, development, deployment) and his friend will be contacting his connections to use the product.

1809860,comment,1808963,1808963,0,0,btilly,,,"For those who don't understand the Black-Scholes references, here is a quick explanation.<p>What Black and Scholes proved in their famous paper is that if you start with a portfolio containing a certain fraction of money and stock, and rebalance the portfolio constantly as the stock price moves according to certain rules, then after a fixed amount of fluctuation in the stock price you will be left with either pure stock or pure money, depending on the eventual price of the stock.  In short, this portfolio acts exactly like an option.  And therefore the price of an option should match the price of the portfolio.  If it doesn't match, then you can buy one and sell the other to get free money until they do match.<p>This is fine, but in the real world we trade options based on a fixed period of time, not a fixed amount of variation in the stock.  The answer to this which finance uses is to estimate the volatility of the stock.  Given known volatility, and a known time period, you can tell how much variation there is, and then use the Black-Scholes model to price options.<p>Mandelbrot's critique of this is that volatility itself is not constant.  Therefore you can't really predict when the Black-Scholes portfolio will expire.  In particular the model systemically underestimates the likelihood of extreme events.  When this catches all of finance off guard, the result is frequently some sort of crisis.",1287546117

I figured it was a low introductory price, but not so low that I'd get careless users who wouldn't put any effort into the game and would just give it 1 star reviews, which was a bigger problem back a few months ago before Apple took out ""rate-on-delete"".<p>These days, I feel like there are less tangible disadvantages to the 99c price point, other than the fact that you make less per sale. There's still the issue that users are willing to put more effort into a product they pay more for, and will even go to further lengths to defend it, because they want to justify their purchase and their taste.<p>On the App Store, it all comes down to perceived risk. If a user is unsure about an app, they probably won't spend much more than 99c because they don't want to overspend on a dud. Once a user sees an app in Apple's ""featured list"" or has used the lite version of that app, they'll be much more willing to splurge on a higher price, because they know what they're getting.<p>For Trainyard, I felt that there was no longer a big difference between the $1.99 and $2.99 price points, because by the time a user arrived at the purchasing page, they already knew they wanted it.<p>All that being said, there is a <i>large</i> contingent of users that seem to only buy apps at $0.99, but most of the time, your apps won't be visible to those users.

Which is convenient because you can create synthetic versions of options that people want to have but which are not traded.  Leading up to the '87 market crash, lots and lots of these synthetic options were created.  Then came the crash.<p>People can debate endlessly about why the crash started.  But once it did, there is no question that trading algorithms attempted to close out trades that were necessary to maintain synthetic options.  These large trades attempted to execute in markets that had seized up, and made the market much, much worse.  The result contributed greatly to the crash, and caused the synthetic options to fail to work as promised.  (Besides, the Black-Scholes algorithm guarantees that it acts like an option through a certain amount of variation in the stock price, and not for a particular time period.  The volatility of the crash demonstrated the importance of this discrepancy.)<p>Now do you see how the Black-Scholes model contributed to that crash?",1287544689

Ditto for all of the canvas.create_foo classes in the second half - you should have objects which set themselves up, have update, draw and think methods and so on, inheriting from a common class.<p>In terms of functions, you're pretty much on the money - there's a lot of function creation for very little gain in terms of readability or (at a guess) speed. You'd be better off either queuing dictionaries or strings as arguments for function generation, or else just using threads for your AI and having one method which handles all the drawing and updating within your environment.<p>In addition to this, there are lots of places (__update_pos in particular) where he should be using functions (or methods) and doesn't - anywhere where there's repetition and/or common functionality, in this case updating the position of an image, really should have a function. Doubly so within large function or method bodies, like __new_population in <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pygaf/source/browse/trunk/optimization_ga.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/pygaf/source/browse/trunk/optimizat...</a> - ""if blahblah:"" followed by a huge chunk of code is just crying out to be a function.",1287544057
1809788,story,,,15,2,jdefr89,"HN: Anyone looking for a technical co-founder?",,"I am interested in finding a co-founder to chase my endeavors with. Specifically I am looking for someone who is highly technical, and has a deep understanding of low-level computing (Can code in C, knows x86 Asm, so on and so forth).<p>I am aiming to build creative products that solve difficult, more low-level problems associated with computers. I am not so much interested in doing gimmicky web startups (although if a great idea is out there I will dive into a web solution as well)<p>Obviously I am looking for a naturally motivated person, someone who loves to hack, innovate, brain-storm, and have fun with new ideas. Also someone with persistence and patience.<p>If anyone out there has these qualities and is looking to partner up with myself, who has very similar attributes to the ones described above, please feel free to shoot me an e-mail to talk!<p>jdefr89@gmail.com<p>Thanks!",1287544019

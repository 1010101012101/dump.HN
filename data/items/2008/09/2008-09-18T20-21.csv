308560,comment,308347,308347,0,0,wired247,,,"The reason that Microsoft/Windows has such a dominant market share has nothing to do with how 'open' the PC market is—it is due to the historical predominance of Microsoft DOS which is related to the fact that IBM was the first company that sold 'Personal' Computers into businesses.  In the 1970's virtually no individuals had computers of their own, and the vast majority of people who had used a computer were exposed to it at work.<p>As businesses purchased IBM PCs instead of terminals for large IBM mainframes or minis, more and more people were exposed to computers.  Apple was selling computers into a very different market—they were serving computer 'enthusiasts', in the 1970's that was a very limited group akin to those people who build thier own sailboats or airplanes.  IBM was exposing a much larger and more homogenous group of people to computers—people with jobs ;-)<p>As computers became more mainstream over the years there were just more people who had used and were familiar with 'PCs' running MS-DOS, which eventually transitioned into Windows.  The Microsoft piece of the personal-computer market has ALWAYS been bigger in the modern era, because it was the easy choice—people used it at work, bought it for home, and were comfortable recommending the same approach for their friends and co-workers.<p>Mobile devices such as smartphones are VERY 'personal'.  With the possible exception of the BlackBerry, which will have been imposed on a lot of people through their jobs (as the PC/MS combo was in the 70's and 80's) people are free to choose whatever they want for their device.  The majority of the market will not choose a smartphone based on whether or not the OS is 'open' or 'closed'—they will very likely not understand the distinction.<p>Apple understands that users will not be interested in apportioning blame between the hardware manufacturer, the OS provider and the applications developers.  AT&T probably understands this too, and so will other carriers.  If/when Android develops any of the little <i>issues</i> that are very common with applications written for other 'open' platforms, those issues will reflect poorly on all parties involved.<p>The public at large will not understand and accept the compromises in applications that those of us in the ""blogosphere"" take for granted  They will not keep coming back to try an application through 25 ""point"" releases until it is finally/potentially better and more robust than any 'closed-OS' alternative - they will give up on it.<p>Customers will choose smartphones based on how USABLE they are, how many useful and easy-to-use features they have, how reliable they are, and how 'cool' they are.  Unfortunately, Android and any other completely 'open' OS is likely to have more buggy applications and security issues than a semi-monitored 'closed' system like the iPhone OS.  I do not think Android will ever be a major player in the smartphone space unless/until they modify their definition of 'open' to allow some method for 'vetting' of applications.",1221770531

308558,comment,308347,308540,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Perhaps I'm wrong, but I do think ease of use will be more of a selling point then power and capability.</i><p>I think you're wrong, but not because the tradeoff will be ""ease of use"" vs. ""power and capability"".  Power and capability <i>are</i> coming to mobile devices, both from Apple and from the market at large, and people <i>will</i> use that power and capability.  It won't matter whether you (""you"" being a placeholder for pretty much everybody in the developed world) think you need more apps running on your phone--you will have them, and you will like them, and you will use them more and more in place of your desktop or laptop machine.  This is the way it will be in a couple years time, and you can quote me on that.<p>You're coming to the conclusions you are (that the iPhone will somehow become the leading mobile device--note that I didn't say it would maintain a leadership position, because it has never had a leadership position...it has 25% of the smart phone market, but that's a small niche of the whole mobile market) because you're framing the question wrong.<p>You're assuming there are huge tradeoffs: Ease of use with the apps that Apple says you can have vs. hard to use, ugly, but with super jet powered applications that allow you to rule the world while sitting on the toilet.  The reality will be more like how the PC industry shook out (I'm pretty darned sure, anyway): Good enough ease of use, good enough products, nice enough looking, and dramatically cheaper and more powerful than the Apple counterpart.<p>When every phone is a smart phone, the smart phone market will look dramatically different than it does today.  It'll look a lot more like the regular mobile phone market (which is to say, a hodgepodge of products from a hodgepodge of manufacturers--but Android has a good chance at being a leading OS on those products).",1221770083

308545,comment,308331,308384,0,0,ken,,,"When I was young, I went with my parents to buy one (to replace a really old gas mower).  We tried out a few at the store on the patch of grass out front, and they were a <i>lot</i> of work.  I could just barely push it.  Then we pulled out the instruction manual and read how to adjust the blades, made one small adjustment, and it instantly became really easy.  Even easier than our old gas mower.<p>I've heard TV stores intentionally adjust some TVs (which would otherwise all look virtually the same) to look worse, to convince you to buy one nicer than that.  Could it be that lawnmower stores keep some push mowers sitting in the back, with the blades cranked all the way down to ""impossible to push"", to convince you to pay a lot more for a gas mower?<p>I'd never buy a gas mower again.

308543,comment,308347,308510,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>First, if you narrow you scope a bit you see that the Mac is still the market leader in certain market segments.</i><p>If you're willing to play the ""in this market segment"" game, you can make anybody a winner.  OpenBSD totally has a lock on the ""paranoid dudes in their mom's basement who think Debian is too damned corporate"" market segment.<p><i>The PC dominates overall because it is a generic business machine. But can you say the same about cellphones?</i><p>I think you can.  ""A generic mobile device"".  There, I said it.<p>The PC, in hindsight, I think was obviously a case of fully proprietary (Apple) vs. mostly open (the PC, with DOS and later Windows).  One can easily say, ""It's the applications!""  And you'd be right...but why were there more apps for PC than Mac?  Bigger market, sure.  But, if Apple could stop people from making applications for the Mac, and Microsoft couldn't, I know which OS I'd be developing for.  And that's the situation here.  Apple are basically being bastards to their customers and their developers, and because Apple products are really attractive, extremely well-executed, and generally good and useful, people haven't <i>immediately</i> noticed what a bastard Apple is being about the whole thing.  But, I think Matt's right.  People <i>will</i> notice that Apple is treating them like crap, with abusive contracts, abusive terms for distribution of applications, and anti-competitive practices with regard to who gets to make and sell apps for the iPhone.  It's already happening, and Apple will either wise up, or lose out.<p><i>You could even say that with Vista's DRM, even the PC is heading that way, where the open platform will eventually be relegated to a niche enthusiast market.</i><p>Nobody is saying that Microsoft is open, or good for consumers.  At least, I didn't take Matt's post to indicate that at all.  He merely used the early PC vs. Mac war as an interesting historical precedent for what's going to play out in the mobile market and for the very same reasons: Cost, availability of apps, and control (i.e. who controls your device: you, or the manufacturer?).<p>I think the comparisons are pretty obvious and pretty difficult to argue against.  The current behavior and direction of Microsoft (and its own historical abusive behavior) is irrelevant.  Nobody is going to argue that the PC was a less open platform than the Mac in the 80s and 90s, and changes in the landscape since then don't alter history.<p><i>So it is easy to imagine the cell market being dominated by the most shiny thingy.</i><p>I think it'll be dominated by the cheapest thing that does what people want, just like PCs.  It is becoming a commodity...as most mass-manufactured goods do.",1221769423

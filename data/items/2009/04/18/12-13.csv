They act as remote drives in the left pane which you can interact with just like an external drive. It's not free, but it's pretty cheap and really versatile. You can have drives auto mount on login, and it can be controlled from your terminal.",1240058258

568284,comment,566565,567235,0,0,weavejester,,,"Yeah, that decision seems a bit daft. Copyright infringement doesn't cause any <i>direct</i> financial harm to the publisher, as one pirated copy doesn't necessarily equal one lost sale. So even if piracy is at 90%, you may not have lost many sales. But if you're letting people use your bandwidth and processing time for free, there <i>is</i> a direct financial loss, and 90% suddenly becomes a huge problem.",1240057965
568283,comment,567807,567807,0,0,ftse,,,"OK, I've not read the article or any of the comments. My theory is, well, it all comes down to Game Theory. All things being equal, if you are nice, an arsehole or rich, if a guy/gal suspects you are _significantly_ smarter than they are, they will (un-)consciously believe you will soon find a 'better' partner and move on. So they don't invest in you => you don't get laid.",1240057140

568281,comment,568263,568263,0,0,olegp,,,"Vertical search engines which scrape a large number of sites already do something like this and some may already have the tools described in the article. That being said most use regular expressions instead of XPath because of malformed markup. CSS selectors are another option.<p>In my opinion the other side of the problem with uptake of the semantic web is that the tools and formats used to describe and access the data are kind of heavy weight. It would be nice if there was a simple way to define new data types as well as store and access the data. Perhaps something like Google Base with a bit of server-side JavaScript for scraping thrown in?",1240056951

While the term ""female mathematician"" is oddly dismissive, Sophie Germain is nevertheless famous mainly because she was a <i>woman</i> who did mathematics.  This isn't to diminish her remarkable achievements in the face of entrenched sexism, but she was hardly a great mathematician.<p>In fact, I'd hazard to guess that a plausible list of the 100 greatest mathematicians and theoretical physicists (for most of history there was little distinction between the two) would contain at most two women (Emmy Noether and Maria Goeppert Mayer).  I have a theory about why this is the case, but this comment box is too small to contain it.",1203892972

122722,comment,122106,122416,0,0,sudeepjuvekar,,,"Interesting indeed!... The post was made in 1999 and a few things have changed since then<p>The author writes that the conditions in India and China are ""worse"", which might have been true in 1999, but certainly not today! See <a href=""http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/20apac.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/20apac.htm</a>\nInterestingly, academic jobs are on the rise as well with burgeoning of new grad schools/research institutes. The demand-supply curve in India is skewed in other direction. Finally, (this is an information gathered from a few senior professors, haven't found any web resource yet!), the success of grant proposals in India is of the order of 60-70%, much higher than that in the U.S.<p>Though, it's still a fact that academia is not looked as a 'lucrative' career option yet.<p>(Well, as a supplement to an earlier post, there are a bunch of hilarious webpages by Philip Greenspun.

We had a request from abroad to purchase five laptops and pay equal amounts on four credit cards held in different names. That doesn't look even vaguely legitimate. Nor was it an isolated incident.<p>Once you take into account more plausable fraud, damages, refunds and Japanese versions of Windows, I'd presume that selling Japanese laptops outside of Japan is a really quick way of getting burned.",1203892819
122719,comment,122093,122329,0,0,KayJayKay,,,"In the absence of more information about the graph and how the data was created, yeah. The rest of what she says, though, are mostly bizarre inferences. Based on that, and reading the rest of her profile, I don't think she really cares about science. I have a hard time thinking that people would, as a society, willingly choose to not have clean running water, environmental protection, or sewage treatment plants because it might not be ""pious"".<p>The thing to ask now should be to ask is what is the casual relationship, if any, between the two data sets and if there is a way to test the relationship. I think she may also be missing out on the idea of ""aggregate"" sums.<p>If you look at the color of the dots, though, you see that richer continents don't overlap; or at least, they seem discrete. That's interesting.",1203892797

I came across a blog to day with their groups listed so I might put that at the bottom under groups when I add the groups or maybe even a group widget on its own. I missed del.icio.us off too...<p>As for an alternative for the iframe, I am working on this too, I will do a flash version and a JS version.

If Macs design is inefficient and expensive then someone will trump them. However, I've had packages delivered damaged because they paste one strip of tape over the main part of the flap; One package even arrived with the tape a good inch off of the flap, so it made it all the way to my house with half of it being open, and if -- like other companies do -- they had taped along the edges too, it wouldn't have meant half my stuff went missing and cost the company over $200.",1203891432

There is a spectrum of academics out there, that map to a spectrum of different personalities.  Some work on stuff few people care about, some work in the mainstream and some pioneer the mainstream.  There are pro/cons to all three types.<p>Personally, I do not know many startup founders.  But, the basic underlying principle of success (that I've gathered from news.yc) is ""build something people want.""  So startups are there to provide services.  Necessarily, founders <i>do care</i> what other people think.<p>Academic scientists don't necessarily have that constraint.",1203891004

122700,comment,122628,122680,0,0,Electro,,,"I'll back this up by saying my Dell Inspiron 9400 has some odd creaking in areas. I'm sure these are just from age, but firstly the cover protecting the ram is now bald because it was painted steel not anodized aluminium, which rather disappointed me as it now looks even uglier.<p>The main problem is the hard drive is attatched by 2 screws and makes a funny creaking noise. However, the chassis above it flexes visibly with any form of pressure, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the edging snaps clear of the main body. The DVD drive is attatched by one screw and merely having a two-tone CD in the drive can make it vibrate like hell; I believe the worst was the game disc for Black & White, it sounded like the drive was damaging itself. I downloaded a NOCD patch because I was nervous about having it vibrate that much.<p>In addition to this, the screen is held flimsily on by IIRC two screws and it has lost its rigidity over the years. Even just putting the laptop down while in use can cause the screen to shift by 2.5-5 degrees.<p>Comparably, I would go with a MacBook next. My brother, who's had his longer than my laptop, has had no problem with his except that they use torx screws so swapping his ram proved mildly problematic. $20 for a 7 piece set fixed that problem though... I'd sure swap the ease of upgrade in my flimsy Dell for an extra $20 to upgrade a sturdy Mac.",1203890407

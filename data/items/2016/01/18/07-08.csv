10923165,comment,10922748,10922956,0,0,Veratyr,,,"There are numerous, with upsides and downsides:<p>- Capture One Pro (Paid): This is the most complete alternative in my opinion. It can handle ingestion, taxonomy and editing. Ingestion and taxonomy are adequate but not fantastic. Editing is superior to Lightroom in my opinion. It&#x27;s a little more complicated than Lightroom but I usually produce better results in a shorter amount of time. Also the processing quality in Capture One Pro is pretty consistently better than Lightroom in my experience.<p>- Photo Mechanic (Paid): This is solely for ingestion and to a limited degree, taxonomy. It has zero functionality for editing but plenty for moving photos around, copying them from places and to places etc. I often see it recommended by professionals as the fastest way to pull in and pick photos from a shoot.<p>- DxO Optics Pro (Paid): Zero taxonomy or ingestion capability. This is solely an editing tool. Its main target is superior optical correction and processing quality. I find it delivers on both of these but I also find its &quot;magic&quot; features like &quot;smart lighting&quot; to get in the way. Capture One Pro usually produces better results for me. One thing DxO does to fantastically though is noise reduction. Whatever PRIME is, it does a damn good job. On the other hand, DxO seems to have issues with my Sony A7II where the colour is consistently wrong (colours always have a red offset). I haven&#x27;t noticed this with other cameras though.<p>- Polarr (Paid, with a free online version): Solely for editing. It&#x27;s very much like Snapseed (an Android/iOS app) on the desktop. Interestingly, their desktop app appears to be a repackaged version of their web app (<a href=""https://www.polarr.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.polarr.co/</a>). I find it to be very high quality and very easy to use but I really prefer having my editor integrated with my library and keep coming back to Capture One Pro. If you&#x27;re editing things separately, I think Polarr is a fantastic choice. I&#x27;d actually rate it higher than DxO Optics Pro (based on the output I&#x27;ve had from it).<p>- Darktable (FOSS): Does ingestion, taxonomy and editing but doesn&#x27;t really any of them well. The UI is confusing and (at least to me) unappealing, the editing tools are limited and the taxonomy, while more present, is too complicated to figure out. I&#x27;ve tried to like Darktable but I just can&#x27;t.<p>- RawTherapee (FOSS): Zero taxonomy but all the knobs and sliders you&#x27;d want when it comes to editing. They&#x27;ve put _a lot_ of effort into their image processing and it&#x27;s high quality and extremely customisable. You can fiddle with demosaicing algorithms and the like all you want. Hell, you can even implement one yourself with little effort (I wrote one that&#x27;s currently sitting in a PR somewhere). Same issue with this that I had with Polarr though, I like having my library and my photos integrated.<p>- Nik Collection (Paid): A product that was acquired by Google and still appears to be developed. They have a bunch of individual tools tailored to particular kinds of output that seem to produce high quality results but should really be integrated into a single package. No taxonomy or ingestion, pure editing.",1453103981

But one is 18 and has just started working, the other is 65 and has just retired. Is the 65 year old really 1000x richer than the 18 year old, because the 18 year old has saved $100 so far and the 65 year old has had time to save $100,000? Is this really 1000x inequality? For the purposes of determining inequality, these people should be considered equal, because it&#x27;s simply the case that one person is older and has had more time to save.<p>A fair assessment of a person&#x27;s wealth, at least when determining fairness and inequality, should include more than this. It should include an estimate of their future earnings potential plus the social security/welfare state entitlements and state pensions that they are entitled to.<p>Otherwise you have hundreds of millions of people in the West with negative &quot;wealth&quot; who in reality will enjoy a far wealthier life than someone in the developing world with small positive financial assets and no debt.<p>Someone with $100 in assets and no debt does not get to claim that they are single handedly &quot;richer&quot; than the combined net worth of tens of millions of university graduates that each have a total career earnings potential of millions of dollars, but who each still have outstanding student debt  and thus negative net worth.<p>Also see this article on the &quot;the wealthy living paycheck to paycheck&quot; [2] which points out that people that will enjoy very wealthy lifestyles are spending rather than saving their income, and therefore really are rich yet will be written off as being far &quot;poorer&quot; than others in terms of financial assets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=C26E3824-E868-56E0-CCA04D4BB9B9ADD5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/inde...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/25/wealthy-americans-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-income-paying-bills"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/25/wealthy-amer...</a>",1453103692

The reason is good old supply and demand. If everyone can use a technology, then the ability to use it is not something you can sell very highly.<p>Take writing for example.

US law takes property rights more seriously than most other countries, because the US never had to get rid of feudalism. Also, one of the few lawbooks available in the early days of the US was Blackstone, who was a property rights absolutist.<p>In feudalism, land ownership implies the obligation to protect the inhabitants and gives them certain rights. One remnant of this is that, in Britain, you have the right to walk on the undeveloped private property of others. Also, most European countries afford renters much stronger rights than the US does.<p>Many nomadic societies, from the Mongols to native Americans, don&#x27;t recognize the right to own real estate you&#x27;re not currently using.  Sharia law has the concept that land can be unowned by anyone, and can revert to that state if unused, although many Islamic countries do not do that in practice.<p>So no, property rights do not stem from &quot;natural law&quot;.",1453103588

The only difference between zones and UNIX running on bare metal is that the hardware is abstracted away, especially storage. Zones use the underlying ZFS pool in the global zone, but have no privileged access to the zpool. However, if necessary, devices can be explicitly exported to individual zones, for those rare, rare cases where a zone would need access to them (like for instance running an NTP server and needing access to the hardware clock). This however is not recommended.<p>The reason why KVM runs as fast or faster on SmartOS than it does on GNU/Linux is the fact that in order to port it to the SunOS / illumos kernel, the kernel engineers at Joyent used DTrace, and systematically improved performance.<p>> Solaris derivatives without Oracle backing are already lagging behind in terms driver support for modern hardware, new chipsets, etc.<p>Actually illumos / SmartOS contains OpenZFS and numerous bug fixes Oracle Solaris may not import, since Oracle would then have to open source Solaris again. Indeed, illumos is now the repository of record for (Open)ZFS, DTrace, and numerous other bug fixes and enhancements, because most of the core kernel engineers who worked on those technologies quit Oracle and are now working in their new companies on illumos / SmartOS.<p>UltraSPARC T1 and T2 are still supported, but newer SPARC hardware from Oracle has a death sentence, since it is a closed platform; illumos runs on AMD, and it runs best on intel; intel based servers have the best support.

Hand-curated ads would go a long way towards preserving design, performance and even revenue since most ad blockers wouldn&#x27;t block them.<p>However, there&#x27;s still massive benefits to outsourcing ads—namely advanced analytics, targeting, and click fraud detection right out of the box. Implementing any of those in-house is certainly non-trivial.<p>That said, most publications—especially niche ones—are selling direct to their audience right now. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, unless consumers prove adverse to paying for content in a subscription manner. I tend to strongly agree with you on that point.<p>While perceived value is one issue on that front, I think a lot of it has to do with the inconvenience of signing up, paying, and logging in. App stores don&#x27;t have this issue, and they offer a lot of print media content these days, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really solved anything yet.<p>Film has Netflix.

Taking the 2014 reduced numbers, that is still a 262% increase in 14 years. In contrast, the TOTAL economy has grown 224.89% since 2000.  Why is THAT not the story? &quot;Global share of bottom 50% growing faster than the world economy&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative perchance?<p>Besides which, isn&#x27;t that F^$%^&$ing amazing! That the bottom 50% areover 2 and a half times richer. That is world changing for the people it affects, surely? Yet the story is the rich have more. Really, &quot;Rich have more&quot; is the story? I can&#x27;t wait for &quot;water is wet&quot; as installment 2.<p>More importantly, why is the story not the drop from 2010 to 2014? What was that?<p>So I sought out the source: <a href=""https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=60931FDE-A2D2-F568-B041B58C5EA591A4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fi...</a> and it appears that the wealth in the bottom 50% is made up mostly of mostly of two things (see figure 8, page 12):\n1. Poor nations - e.g. Africa and, largest of all, India which accounts &quot;... for over a quarter of people in the bottom half of the distribution&quot;.\n2. Ruch Americans in debt - the tail seems skewed that way, to me at least.<p>If we take just India, they had a massive currency exchange problem vs the USD since 2010. In 2010, it was 46.21 rupee to the dollar, in December 2014 it was 62.8 (<a href=""http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=USD&to=INR&amount=1&year=2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=USD&to=INR&amount=1&yea...</a>). That is a drop of about a third in value. That is likely at least part of the reason for the wealth drop.<p>2. The percentage projection carries on from what looks like an historical anomaly between 2010 and 2014. If the currency exchange reverses course, and India claws back even 10% of the gap, the percentage to the 1% will likely reverse to some degree.<p>3. The data set for the rich changes dramatically. The minimum to be top 80 in 2014, would be top 15 in 2004.  Zuckerberg appears out of nowhere in 2011, adding a few billion (his wealth versus the 81st position) to the total from nowhere. If Wallmart&#x27;s founder had survived, we&#x27;d have a top 80 with 4 more billionaires in it, making it an even larger a total. That&#x27;s not really indicative of anything (other than rich people can die too).<p>Look, I get Oxfam&#x27;s political agenda, but I think a +262.38% increase in wealth for the bottom 50% - even after what looks like a currency disaster since 2010 - is amazing in and of itself, and any comparison to an arbitrary set of extremely wealthy is just political machinations.",1453102692

Sure.  But if that&#x27;s your only goal - why make games?  And is tackling an impossibly large project really the most effective way to accomplish that learning?<p>Another extremely common goal of making games - I&#x27;d argue far more common than the goal of pure learning - is to have fun playing the game with the idea you had.  Which project is going to let you actually scratch that itch - the never-complete MMO or the quick and dirty shmup?  Which one can you share with your friends and have <i>them</i> play?  Which looks better on your portfolio when applying to that game development studio that makes MMOs, giving you hands on experience with the real deal?",1453102178

If you can&#x27;t or wont, then you&#x27;re missing a lot of what I need to know to buy coffee. (I&#x27;m _way_ off the spectrum this way, but it&#x27;s been years since I bought coffee that was roasted by someone I wasn&#x27;t on a first name basis with...)<p>Unfortunately the words &quot;fair trade&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; on their own are a turn off for many serious coffee people - &quot;fair trade&quot; in particular is widely considered to be a trademark owned by rentseeking marketers that does little to benefit producers (and I don&#x27;t know about the US, but of you use the words &quot;fair trade&quot; in your marketing without the blessing of the Fair Trade(tm) organisation in Australia, you should expect a nastygram from their lawyers fairly promptly).<p>Compare your description of &quot;Mexican Fair Trade Organic light roast&quot; with any of Four Barrel&#x27;s coffee descriptions - they know how to market to &quot;coffee people&quot;. If I care enough about coffee to subscribe to a delivery, I probably want to know more about it that what&#x27;s written on the side of a Folgers can...<p>Critically, you&#x27;re priced fairly high compared to your much more coffee-credible competition - even if I were writing off the 10% you&#x27;re donating to charity, I can still buy beans from any of those four directly at lower than 90% of your pricing. Four Barrel&#x27;s house blend (which to be honest, you&#x27;re unlikely to be able to match quality-wise) is only $17 for 12oz without a subscription commitment.<p>And final point - and I&#x27;m on less certain ground here, I think you&#x27;re also way too short on information about the cause as well. I suspect if you compare the brief information you have for the Muira Village Health Center Project to &quot;leading charity websites&quot; you&#x27;ll come up short in very similar ways.<p>(Cold hard truths follow here - as constructive criticism of what you&#x27;re showing us not a personal attack...)<p>Your site seems to not know enough about either coffee or charity to be credible. The numbers in my head seem to say you&#x27;re skimming 3 or 4 dollars per delivery to get me to buy coffee of unknown provenience and quality from you at top dollar, trying to justify that with some feel-good &quot;donating a coupe of bucks to a cause&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m probably not sure who your target market is (quite likely not me), but the numbers get _worse_ for you as the expectations of world-class coffee go down. If your typical buyer&#x27;s usual alternative is a 2lb can of Folgers from the supermarket, it looks like you&#x27;re pocketing closer to $10 per delivery.<p>I know a business needs a business model and a margin, but I can&#x27;t see anywhere you&#x27;re bringing value to the transaction that makes it worth my while paying your cut. As a coffee drinker with philanthropic tendencies, there are more effective ways for me to spend my money.<p>Good luck with it - I suspect with a _lot_ more information about the coffee, the roasting, and the charities; the outlook and value would improve, but I think you need to think very carefully about who you&#x27;re targeting with this idea, and why they&#x27;d pay you instead of buying coffee from a great roaster and donating to their chosen charity.",1453101754

Some updates and clarifications are in order!<p>First of all, I just woke up (it’s morning here in Helsinki) and found a nice email from Amazon letting me know that they had refunded the retrieval cost to my account. They also acknowledged the need to clarify the charges on their product pages.<p>This obviously makes me happy, but I would caution against taking this as a signal that Amazon will bail you out in case you mess up like I did. It continues to be up to us to fully understand the products and associated liabilities we sign up for.<p>I didn&#x27;t request a refund because I frankly didn&#x27;t think I had a case. The only angle I considered pursuing was the boto bug. Even though it didn&#x27;t increase my bill, it stopped me from getting my files quickly. And getting them quickly was what I was paying the huge premium for.<p>That said, here are some comments on specific issues raised in this thread:<p>- Using Arq or S3&#x27;s lifecycle policies would have made a huge difference in my retrieval experience. Unfortunately for me, those options didn&#x27;t exist when I first uploaded the archives, and switching to them would have involved the same sort of retrieval process I described in the post.<p>- During my investigation and even my visits to the AWS console, I saw plenty of tools and options for limiting retrieval rates and costs. The problem was that since my mental model had the maximum cost at less than a dollar, I didn&#x27;t pay attention. I imagined that the tools were there for people with terabytes or petabytes of archives, not for me with just 60GB.<p>- I continue to believe that “starting at $0.011 per gigabyte” is not a honest way of describing the data retrieval costs of Glacier, especially when the actual cost is detailed, of all things, as an answer to a FAQ question. I hammer on this point because I don&#x27;t think other AWS products have this problem.<p>- I obviously don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s against the law here in Finland to migrate content off your legally bought CDs and then throw the CDs out. Selling the originals, or even giving them away to friend, might have been a different story. But as pointed out in the thread, your mileage will vary.<p>- I am a very happy AWS customer, and my business will continue to spend tens of thousands a year on AWS services. That goes to something boulos said in the thread: &quot;I think the reality is that most cloud customers are approximately consumers&quot;. You&#x27;d hope my due diligence is better on the business side of things, as a 185X mistake there would easily bankrupt the whole company.

The safety Rust offers is only part of a package that provides high-performance high-level abstractions over functionality that is normally very bit-twiddly in C. So far, my favorite thing about Rust is not its safety, but how easy it is to write good performance software using abstractions that are as convenient as Python (or another high-level language). The safety is just icing on the cake at that point (for me at least).<p>EDIT: Re: pointers -- Rust is a lot easier to write if you just ignore pointers. Really. Either pass small structs by value or pass references (either immutable or mutable), and let the compiler handle the actual pointer manipulation.",1453100694

Assuming that a middle-class job pays 3* that amount, and that someone can reasonably save 30% of their salary for the last 20 years they work, that amounts to about $1m saved. Probably a lot less because a person&#x27;s salary isn&#x27;t at it&#x27;s peak for much of their career. Even factoring for a household with 2 incomes at that level you don&#x27;t get to $2.7m.<p>I imagine the people you know <i>are</i> members of the elite as you say, but they got there by by having elite jobs and by investing their elite incomes.

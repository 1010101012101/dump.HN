1781884,comment,1780649,1780649,0,0,chipmunkninja,,,"""Popular"" here is going to mean maybe 15% market share, if my memory serves correctly.  Popular server languages remain Java, PHP, ASP.NET, and increasingly Ruby.<p>In my mind, the reality is that you should choose the programming language based on the skills of you or your programmer(s) and the task at hand.  If I were going to implement a banking system, I'd probably look first at Java and its J2EE libraries to see what options were available there.  I've used PHP recently (despite it being a reasonably painful language) because it has some wonderful productivity and scalability features that we've been able to really take advantage of.<p>However, I've nothing against any of the other platforms (with the exception of a slight bias away from anything that requires me running windows servers), and have been fiddling with Ruby, and also exploring Haskell, Erland, Clojure, and even Scala.<p>Unless we're talking in-house applications using VB or C#, or mobile phone applications using ObjC or Java, ""client-side"" almost always means HTML/CSS/JS these days.<p>So, look at the task and the talent, and go from there. Most of the common platforms that you've heard of are all going to have large enough communities for support and libraries to perform various non-standard tasks.<p>Good luck!",1286844982

If we keep driving around with one SUV per person it doesn't add up to much, comparatively. The low hanging fruit is fixing the metropolitan areas. Most people live there, and demographically, people are still moving there. So fucking around with making cars and rural areas more efficient isn't going to make much difference compared to making metropolitan areas more efficient and reducing car usage within them.<p>That said, rural college towns can have pretty awesome bus systems that run all year, even during subzero temperatures, and they can also have bike paths that go mostly everywhere, which are usable for nine months of the year.

The cost of having the world's largest addressable audience of any development platform is that web developers have to deal with the fact that it varies a lot. Them's the breaks.<p>Edit: because I hate comments that are purely negative, my suggestion for getting users to the latest technologies is to use libraries (like YUI and jQuery) which do the hard work of implementing newer features in backwards compatible ways, but use the modern feature if it's available. That way the difference between IE8 and a more recent browser becomes one of performance rather than the binary absence of functionality. Users can that way see what they're missing and have a reason to upgrade that's more compelling than the designer petulantly insisting their browser sucks.",1286844507

That way you'll probably figure out what works for you and if the framework is going to meet your needs.<p>You seem hesitant to just pick something and go for it, so this way at least you can try a few thing out before you launch into it and find out halfway through that you don't like the way things work.

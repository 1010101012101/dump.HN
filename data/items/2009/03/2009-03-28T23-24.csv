536929,comment,536440,536902,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's an interesting point.  I suspect it depends a lot upon their concrete programming skills as demonstrated in the interview.  It's funny how my first reaction - even as someone who always says ""Your degree doesn't define you, and talent will find jobs no matter where you went to school"" - was to assume that the Stanford history major is much smarter than the CSU Chico CS major, and just happened to pick the wrong major.  But that's not necessarily true: maybe the guy from Chico is a Zawinski-class programming genius that happened to grow up in a family with no money and no college expectations.  The point of the interview is to tease out circumstances like that so talented people from bad situations can rise to the top anyway.<p>It's also interesting because I know some Amherst history majors that I could never imagine getting a job at Google.  But I also know an Amherst Asian Languages & Civ major who <i>does</i> work at Google, albeit in a non-technical position.  Yet I don't know anyone at Google from a CSU: my friends here are from Rice/Brown/Brown/Amherst/Stanford/Berkeley/  Stanford/UChic/Cornell/Berkeley/Berkeley/ CMU/Duke/UCSD.",1238284361

Unregulated Wall St has fared far better.<p>>> And they were hedged by contracts that were of comparable size.<p>> Not at AIG they weren't<p>Yes, they were - that's how regulated insurance works.<p>> which is why so much of our taxpayer money is flowing through them to the counter-parties of their CDS contracts -- e.g., Goldman Sachs.<p>The money is flowing because the assets backing up the liabilities weren't actually worth enough and the risk was underestimated.<p>> Regulators have made it possible for me to drink, does that mean it is their fault when I contract alcohol poisoning?<p>It means that you can't say that regulation solves alcohol poisoning.",1238283856

Many assignments require the use of packages like Matlab, Maple, and Pro/E  - the idea being that we'll use these things in industry so we may as well get used to them in university. There are also a series of packages that are used that are free, but hard to find/maintain individually.<p>It also comes down to standardization - if I'm marking circuit layouts, I want everyone to use the same version of Electric that I did, so it's easy for me to deal with fifty submissions.

It took several iterations and beta-testing on friends and family until I formulated my pitch into a 3 minute high-level interactive approach. E.g:<p>""We all use the web and love it. Oh man, this is my favorite website, I'm gonna do X and catch up with Y, but look! [problem description here]. [explain the aggravation caused by the problem. [real numbers about the loss in productivity or lost sales potential]. [projected growth in my industry, a quick highlight of what's out there and how we're different and better]."" Then I go into the project description and everyone is delighted at that point.<p>To engage the people ask them questions. Instead of ""we all do X"" say ""don't we all do X?"". Instead of saying something is a problem for you, say ""is it just me or does X bug the hell out of anybody else?

I also ask what the IMF's actual record tells us about its relevance.  I also point out that the US folk involved are largely IMF folk....<p>I note that you haven't taken me up on my offer of the phone numbers of the US.  If you actually believe that ""more data"" is a good idea, you'd leap on that offer as helpful for each and every problem, but you haven't.<p>Why don't you want my data?  Does your refusal suggest that you actually believe that irrelevant data is harmful?  Is it the source, that data from a mean person is harmful?  What?<p>> I can't resist quoting Google here, that ""more data"" is the way to go, as Norvig argues (slightly out of context; field is machine-learning):<p>You might try actually reading it.  Norvig is a stickler for good and relevant data.<p>> I'm more or less arguing for that the IMF, or any other org. in those waters, has a lot of rich data in their possession.<p>And I never wrote otherwise.  There's rich data everywhere.  The problem is getting the right data and doing something useful with it.<p>> Regarding ""abuse through power aggregation in developing nations"" I don't have an example right now, on how that directly applies to the U.S. situation.<p>Fair enough.",1238282980

Some groan, but that's part of the fun, like sweet+sour sauce.<p>A few folks get annoyed.  My guess is they don't get  language jokes, and they feel stupid.<p>Puns have a show-off quality to them, but they're wasted if the audience can't partake, so it's not simply self-centered.<p>Unlike guitar skills the crowd needs  almost the same chops as the punster to make it work.",1238282799

536898,comment,536440,536805,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Studying history gives you perspective. You don't need to major in it, but the heart of historical research consists of analyzing all the known evidence from a time/event and trying to logically argue a case for why things happened as they did, and/or finding the weaknesses in others' interpretations. It's not about memorizing dates.<p>The mainstream in computer science is incredibly ignorant of its own history, and burns a ton of energy reinventing the wheel every few years. (The old school Unix tools still work, for example, they're just fast as heck now because they were written to work on computes with about as much processing power as a bar of soap has these days.)",1238282305

While if you get a degree in something specific like engineering, your job will probably end up outsourced to India.""<p>Luckily, I happened to like computers anyway, and learned quite a bit of programming on my own.  Plus, by sophomore year I'd basically figured out this was bullshit and employers really <i>do</i> care about concrete skills.

It turns out that early on (about a year into it) someone came along and offered to buy the whole business for $1 million dollars.<p>At the time his situation was bleak:<p>* the site was being overshadowed by two much larger direct competitors
* he was 'hosting' the site from borrowed space in a kind relatives basement.
* growth was really solid, but revenues from the site where far outpaced by bandwidth/hardware costs.
* He had a second mortgage on his house and his credit cards where completely maxed. His wife, while understanding, was understandably distressed.<p>The thing was, he absolutely believed in his business. He was confident that he was going to be able to overtake those competitors. Instead of selling and pocketing a nice gain, he pushed on.<p>5 years later he had a top-100 alexa site that sold for $300 million dollars. He had managed to stave off even VC funding until quite late, and so the vast majority was held by him and a co-founder.<p>That's the opposite of risk aversion. It's funny, he considers not selling one of the stupidest things he's ever done. Anyone in their right mind would sell and move on to something else. He didn't, and it paid off with a 300x return.",1238281620

Except for the connections your synapses make ...<p>Frankly, it's hard to feel sorry for <i>students</i> who will not 'read the FAQ', or do anything to improve their conditions by themselves, if they feel it's important.

If it's anything like their tech support, I'm sure they'll get back to you in short order. </sarcasm><p>Seriously though, you're probably better off dealing with OpenStreetMap or something where you don't have to deal with licensing. If you do license maps, do it with someone who you can have an actual adult phone conversation with. The bozos answering e-mails at Google will likely give you the bureaucratic runaround (or reacharound), if they ever get back to you at all.",1238216214

I wasn't ""attempting to unfold"" mine, I was just following a thread.<p>I actually regret writing what I did now, especially using the word ""crazy"". I sound judgemental and snarky. However, I don't think I misread the post as badly as you imply. I just read it again and still think the guy sounds dangerously fixated upon PG, the person, rather than maintaining an abstracted appreciation of his works. He even says it straight at the end:<p><i>""Youâ€™ve deeply influenced me in many ways and love you, hate you or love you again, you are on my list of Heroes!""</i><p>I never want to ""crucify"" anyone for opening their heart or showing a little emotion but if this is heartfelt, and it reads like it to me, he's going too far. Not in his writing but internally. It reads like he's looking for a Guru.<p>Maybe he is writing humourously (the old ""it was satire!"" defense?) but in the end words have meaning. He could be pretending to be a person with a dangerous tendency to fixate on 3rd parties or he could actually be that person, how can I, or anyone else, tell? Whatever - the person in whose voice that post is written, fictional or not, is not on the path to happiness with this type of thinking.",1238215088

536180,comment,535675,536060,0,0,rkts,,,"Consider the getLine function:<p><pre><code>  getLine :: IO String
</code></pre>
getLine takes nothing as its input--not the state of the world, or whatever, but <i>nothing</i>--and produces a string that's inside an IO monad.  To all appearances, it's an impure function.  But because the String is inside a box (so to speak) you can't peek at it--instead, you can only give it to another function, provided that function also returns a box you can't peek into.<p>In effect, this creates two classes of functions.  Some, like getLine, can have side effects, generate random values, look into other boxes, whatever.  These are technically ""pure"" in a mathematical sense since their outputs are always inside identical boxes, but in practice they behave just like impure functions, and you reason about them the same way.  The rest have more restricted capabilities, and because their values aren't inside boxes, the compiler can verify that they return distinct values in a pure manner.<p>So, for an extreme example, consider this function:<p><pre><code>  foo (x) { x++; return x; }
</code></pre>
In Haskell foo would return ""IO Int,"" which means the ""Int"" may be produced impurely.  Actually, the integer is produced in a pure manner, so it would be fine for foo to return a plain Int.  But the way Haskell determines purity is too crude to figure that out: all it knows is that foo depends on a mutation, which <i>may</i> make the output impure.  Impurity is contagious, so foo ""catches"" it from ++ and thus has to put its output in a box.<p>Hence, the typical description of pure functional programming as ""functions only transform inputs to outputs"" is only true in the most trivial mathematical sense, and has no practical import.  Pure functional programming really means writing a crude proof that a certain subset of your program is pure, and the compiler checking the proof for you.<p>(Disclaimer: I understand that this is a very vague high-level description of monads, that monads can work in other ways and do many other things, and that purely functional languages can handle state/side effects/etc. in other ways.  It's a complex issue and I'm just trying to convey the way that it usually works in practice.)",1238214506

Yes, you have to think, but sometimes you just need to churn through it, too, and frankly it's ridiculous to suggest that having a faster build process wouldn't help this.<p>And I, personally, get distracted pretty easily.

536162,comment,535878,535878,0,0,CRASCH,,,"I can say my build times went down considerably. However I moved to a completely new machine.<p>I didn't plan on writing an article so I don't have any official bench marks. I'm guessing they dropped from over a minute and a half for a full recompile to under 30 seconds. Incremental builds used to take  about 20 seconds and now take between 2 and ten seconds.<p>I went from a athlon X64 at 2.2Ghz and 2GB Ram with a 74GB raptor and another 74GB raptor for code to a Core i7 Extreme at 4Ghz and 12GB Ram with 2x80GB intel SSDs in raid 0 and 1 80GB intel SSD for code.<p>A couple of important things to keep in mind. Intel is still the way to go. The other SSDs can actually be slower in write performance than a normal hard drive if the usage pattern is small files. That is pretty much what you get when you compile.<p>One other point is that crappy anti-virus software can affect IO performance anywhere from 12X trend micro, 24X Norton. Yes that is Norton will reduce your IO by 2400% in my tests. AVG Free is 19%. So he could have negated the performance gain from the SSD by running bad anti-virus software.<p>I can say my productivity feels like it nearly tripled.<p>The important measurement from a programming perspective is not necessarily just the second or two here or there. My work flow changed. I used to hit build and walk out and get drink from the fridge in the garage and it would still be compiling. Now I can't even do anything but glance at my email. These interruptions sometimes take you out of the zone and it can take a long time to get back in the zone. Getting up could easily cost me fifteen minutes or even a half an hour. Just because I lost my train of thought.<p>Update: I'm running windows 7 and visual studio 8 on this machine.",1238213436

And that is what has kept the prices there up (relatively speaking).<p>The city infrastructure development [3] has been happening at an incredible pace (for India anyway). This (along with Ahmedabad's property prices being low compared to Bangalore or Mumbai) has attracted a bunch of companies to move there. For example just last week Vodafone moved their service hub to Ahmedabad and relocated 1500 employees there [2].<p>In the area near the nano plant (which is less than 15 KMs from the posh residential areas in West Ahmedabad like Satellite Rd) prices have definitely gone up very very substantially [1] because of the plant itself and how quickly builders have latched onto the opportunity to develop the area: for e.g. the Gulmohar greens golf club is coming up pretty close to the place and Goyal just launched another development there. I know because my parents have owned land in that area for almost 10 years that was worth almost nothing and is now suddenly worth a lot!<p>Within Ahmedabad proper, in the western areas prices haven't gone down anywhere close to they have in Bangalore, for example and in some cases have gone up.

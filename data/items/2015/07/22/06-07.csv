9928100,comment,9926345,9928041,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have only had time to browse the website <i>very</i> quickly (and I have to say that my eyebrowse are raised when a vender of quality carbon steel knives offers a sharpening service since you should sharpen the knife every day or so).  Here is a quick summary.<p>Carbon steel is very soft.  It is really easy to sharpen.  It dulls quickly.  It also can bend (which is very important in some fish knives, but not so desirable for some other knives).  Very high quality knives are made by folding the metal and there is an outer layer of a harder steel (that&#x27;s why you get that pretty pattern).<p>Basically such a knife is easy to get wickedly sharp, but you need to sharpen it a <i>lot</i>.<p>A stainless steel knife is harder steel (and doesn&#x27;t discolor).  It is comparatively difficult to get very, very sharp, but it will hold its edge for quite a while (a few weeks anyway).  You use a &quot;sharpening steel&quot; to rebend the edge of the knife to keep the sharp side facing down.<p>If you want a super sharp knife to do very precise work, nothing beats carbon steel.  Japanese knives in particular are (IMHO) the best because there is a huge variety of knives with very particular properties.  Stainless steel knives a beginner friendly, but apart from that there is virtually no advantages.  Hence they &quot;suck&quot;.<p>Top of the line carbon steel knives are often much cheaper than &quot;top of the line&quot; stainless knives.  Personally, I would never spend huge amounts of money on a stainless knive because you are already pretty limited.  However, I think that they are still useful for many people since carbon steel requires quite a lot of time and skill to look after properly.<p>And since I said &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; with respect to steel, I am aware that I am almost certainly wrong in my usage of the words, so I invite someone with metalurgy knowledge to correct me :-)",1437548280

How likely is mankind to survive the next hundred years if left on its own? Climate change will cause mass migrations of people, starvation, warfare, failed states, some of which will have a nuclear or biological arsenal. Most of the population on earth depends on the continued progress of technology for their life. Without dramatic improvements in biology, the warming earth will simply lack the carrying capacity. Hunger leads to anarchy in a matter of days.<p>Climate change will likely have much worse consequences though. An anoxic event would kill all humans and most other life on earth, as it has several times in earth&#x27;s history.<p>Consider even the simpler threats.

9928062,comment,9926192,9927198,0,0,geofft,,,"So I think that&#x27;s true for some roles but not all. I personally end up arguing about what markets we should and shouldn&#x27;t enter, presenting at industry conferences, etc., because I find that interesting. But, for instance, a junior ops employee on a pager schedule primarily provides business value by getting good at the technologies that other people have chosen, not by paying attention to the market, by being able to present convincing arguments to others, etc. Yet that&#x27;s a crucial role to business values.<p>I think this may be true of junior roles in general, and I think it&#x27;s junior roles where I&#x27;m most worried, as a social-responsibility thing, about the fairness of salaries. I care less about earning $150K when I should be earning $200K than I do about earning $50K when I should be earning $100K, since it makes far more difference in my quality of life. (Even though they&#x27;re the same delta value for the company!)<p>I could buy that there is a more generalize skillset of communication and persuasion: ops getting dev to clean up messes before putting them in prod, developers convincing open source maintainers into fixing their bugs for free, employees convincing prospective new hires to join, etc. And I do think it&#x27;s valuable to measure that in addition to raw technical skill, both in hiring and in performance reviews. But I suspect there&#x27;s enough reason to doubt that that correlates strongly with personal salary negotiation. Some people just don&#x27;t do well pushing back on their direct superiors, but none of these other cases involve direct superiors. Somewhat more rationally, if you&#x27;re worried about your job for office-politics reasons, or if it&#x27;s riskier than usual to lose your income (maybe you&#x27;re starting a family or have health issues), the right decision might be to take a safe, lower salary instead of trying for a higher salary with a small percentage chance of losing the negotiation badly. People without those concerns -- like me, who lives alone with no medical expenses and can bother my parents if worst comes to worse -- have a much higher risk tolerance, and I don&#x27;t think personal risk tolerance particularly proxies for business value.<p>I also think that skill is <i>learnable</i>, and there are obvious poor incentives for a company to teach employees how to ask for more personal salary, but probably great incentives to teach employees how to negotiate better in the general case.<p>(As I understand it, big law firms rely on a sizable work force of associate lawyers and especially paralegals and other staff, who at least start out with very little say in the direction of the firm, what cases are taken, etc., right? And the partners are owners, not simply employees? I can definitely imagine open salaries and probably even unionization for the staff, which wouldn&#x27;t compromise the ability of the partners to keep running the firm and making plenty of money.)",1437547281

No matter how smart you are, you can&#x27;t &quot;prove&quot; something that is false, so no, I don&#x27;t think they could. A good &#x27;rationalist&#x27; would analyze the arguments based on their merit, and if the reasoning is sound, they shift their belief a bit in that direction. If not, then they don&#x27;t. Just like a regular person (they just know how to do the analysis formally and know how to spot appeals to human biases and logical fallacies.)<p>> But then the person knows that the AI is lying to them.<p>No, they don&#x27;t. The AI could just as easily be telling the truth. If it makes an argument, you analyze the merit of the argument and consider counterarguments. If it tries to tell you that something is a fact, that&#x27;s where you treat them as a potentially unreliable source and have to bring the rest of your knowledge to bear, do research, talk to other people, and weigh the evidence to make a judgment when you are uncertain.<p>> their worldview requires them to engage seriously and fairly with every idea they come across. Most people are not burdened with this.<p>Wait, what? So does mine, within reason of course, but it&#x27;s not a &#x27;burden&#x27;. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m obligated to stop and reexamine my views on religion every time a missionary knocks on my door, and LessWrong-ers are no different. But if you hear a convincing argument for something that runs counter to what you think you know, wouldn&#x27;t you want to get to the bottom of it and find out the real truth? I would.<p>From having read LessWrong discussions, I can tell you that people there <i>are</i> in many ways more open to hearing differing viewpoints than your average person, but you&#x27;re treating it like a mental pathology. They can be just as dismissive of ideas that they have already thought about and deemed to be false or that come from unreliable sources (like a potentially unfriendly AI). Your claim that <i>being a self-proclaimed &#x27;rationalist&#x27; introduces an incredibly obvious and easily-exploitable bug into one&#x27;s decision-making process</i> really smells like a rationalization in support of your initial gut reaction to the experiment: That there has to be a trick to it, and that it wouldn&#x27;t work on you.<p>A good rule of thumb when dealing with a complicated problem is this: If a lot of smart people have spent a lot of time trying to figure out a solution and there&#x27;s no accepted answer, then (1) the first thing that comes to your mind has been thought of before and is probably not the right answer, and (2) the right answer is probably <i>not</i> simple.<p>But there&#x27;s an easy way to test this: (1) Sit down for an hour and flesh out your proposed strategy for getting a &#x27;rationalist&#x27; to let you out of the box. (2) Go post on LessWrong to find someone to play Gatekeeper for you. I&#x27;ll moderate. If it works, that&#x27;s evidence that you&#x27;re right. If it doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s evidence that you&#x27;re wrong. Iterate for more evidence until you&#x27;re convinced.<p>But if the first thing that came to your mind upon reading this was a justification for why you would fail if you tried this (&quot;Oh, well I wouldn&#x27;t <i>personally</i> able to do it with this strategy, but...&quot; or &quot;Oh, well I&#x27;m sure this strategy wouldn&#x27;t work <i>anymore</i>, but...) then you&#x27;re already inventing excuses for the way you know it will play out.<p><i>I</i> don&#x27;t know how he did it either.

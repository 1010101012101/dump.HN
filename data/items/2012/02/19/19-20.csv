Now in the land of everything is a DIV and CSS is used to recreate the markup language, this is no longer possible -- at least not in a generic way.

Why shouldn't OS X have a messages app (which actually is just iChat integrated with the Messages protocol)? Or a Notes app? Nothing special here.<p>2) The notification bar was needed in OS X even before iOS appeared. Even Windows Vista introduced a notification sidebar. So, no surprise OS X adopted one too.<p>3) Launcher is indeed an idea borrowed from iOS, to add something OS X needed, namely a quick way to launch apps (and that is not by browsing with the Finder in the Applications folder). OS X user used a lot of similar apps, and the folder Dock ""stacks"" was half-way there.<p>So: apps and ideas are gonna be exchanged between the two.<p>The important thing is:<p>OS X and iOS <i>ALREADY ARE</i> the same OS. The share the same Mach/BSD kernel, the same services, most of the same runtimes, the same filesystem, etc. They are like two different ""distros"" of the same OS, for a different architecture and with a different UI.<p>So, whether OS X and iOS are ""united into onto"" will not be on the OS level (they are already the same kernel etc), but at the UI/runtime level.<p>At the level, there are some signs that the two Cocoa runtimes are converging (for example, iOS used to not have garbage collection, whereas not it has (sort of, with ARC)).<p>But there are no signs that OS X UI and iOS UI are gonna get reunited in the most important distinction, the touch UI thing. Apple has added touch gestures through the trackpad, but there won't be a touch screen. The way monitors/laptop screens work it's just not possible to hold your hand and touch one for stretches of time --you can even get cramps. That cannot be changed: it's the laws of how our body works.<p>What we CAN get, is some kind of laptop with a detachable screen that turns into an iPad --and then supports touch interaction.<p>Until something like that is available, OS X will not get like iOS UI-wise in the only thing that matters: the touch UI. Borrowing some concepts like notification screen, a launcher, or sheets and stuff, does not matter. They could just as easily have been developed for OS X in the first place.",1329680147

Hackathons are sprints, and just like have the occasional sprint workout can be a great way to augment your distance running routine, hackathons can be great for augmenting your software development routine.<p>Here are some reasons why I like taking part in a hackathon event (assuming the goal is to produce some sort of web application):<p>- Tradeoffs are easy.  You have no time for bells or whistles.  You consider a basic feature list and start working.  If a feature starts to take too long to implement it, you just axe it.  You probably end up with something that doesn't have many bells and whistles, but the key distinction is you end up with <i>something.</i>  I can't tell you had some many side projects I've worked on had some painfully implemented bell that was pretty cool, but was pointless because I never got any core functionality working.<p>- All you can do is use what you know.  In one hackathon group I was in, I was the guy who ended up knowing the most sysadmin/web server stuff, and the guy who knew the most HTML/CSS/JS.  So I basically did my best to manage through installing/configuring everything at the server software level, and then mucked around with some CSS templates trying to shoehorn it around my team's application code.  I spent the whole time out of my comfort zone, on two very disparate pieces, and it was great.  Here was an environment that required me to do nothing else but pick up those technical skills, in a very focused time period, with tangible results if I did.  Much more effective than all those times I'd think, ""hmm maybe I'll play around with jQuery more"" and never did.<p>To go back to the running analogy, good software development is like running a marathon.  It takes time and discipline, not preparing effectively usually means you'll end up going slower or being injured, and it's all about a steady incremental process that builds up into something great.  But sometimes it just feels good to toss out your planned 20 mile run for the day, and just run out your front door and sprint around the block as hard as you can for 10 minutes, pushing yourself in a different way and learning something about your skills or capabilities that you never would otherwise.",1329679013

It's a loaded and extreme word. Sure, you can quote an one-sentence online dictionary and use the vagueness of that definition to convince yourself that it is correct. Or you can use an equally simplistic definition like ""privately owned but under absolute control of the gov't"" and again, claim accuracy. No scholar of political science would ever use a one-line definition for something as culturally and politically significt as fascism.<p>Even Wikipedia, hardly a controversial source, wouldn't:  ""Fascism is a radical authoritarian nationalist political ideology.[1][2] Fascists seek rejuvenation of their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people in national identity by suprapersonal connections of ancestry, culture, and blood through a totalitarian single-party state that seeks the mass mobilization of a nation through discipline, indoctrination, physical education, and eugenics.""<p>The discussion is about an important issue: the increasing control of the US gov't and regulatory agencies over the free agency of US citizens. Jumping in and saying ""fascist regime"" is not furthering rational conversation.<p>Also, calling somebody on injecting the emotional baggage of that hyperbole is not making ""rational conversation impossible"".<p>In another paragraph I was asked if use of euphemism by media was a big part of the problem at hand.

3610039,comment,3609418,3609418,11,0,drostie,,,"I'm going to upvote this on the general principle that I've seen a lot of programmers who don't quite know what parsing is, but reading a 310-page book is perhaps not the best way to familiarize them with it.<p>The basic thing that a programmer needs to know about parsing is that regular expressions usually aren't. The big problem with regular expressions is that they have real trouble handling nested modes. Just to give a modestly complicated example of what can happen from a simple grammar with nesting, imagine a grammar with just single-letter variables and parentheses, parsed into Python with tuples:<p><pre><code>    a(bc)def\n    => ('a', ('b', 'c'), 'd', 'e', 'f')\n</code></pre>\nYou <i>might</i> be able to get a regular expression engine to deal with that for you, but it will tend to fail on something slightly more complicated like this:<p><pre><code>    a(b((cde)f)(g)h)ij\n</code></pre>\n...because it will usually either be too conservative and start matching:<p><pre><code>    (b((cde)\n</code></pre>\nor else it will sometimes be too aggressive and start matching:<p><pre><code>    ((cde)f)(g)\n</code></pre>\nPerl is a big exception; Perl actually has a syntax to make regular expressions properly recursive.<p>A good practical example for you to think about is CSV parsing. In CSV, a field can sometimes be quoted so that it may contain commas, and two quoting-symbols inside that field is interpreted as a single quoting-symbol too. Thus to create a table containing a chat, we might have to write:<p><pre><code>    Reginald,I think life needs more scare-quotes.\n    Beartato,""That's nice, Reginald.""\n    Reginald,""Don't you mean """"nice""""?""\n    Beartato,Aah! Your scare-quotes scared me!\n</code></pre>\nWith a straightforward character-by-character parser this is pretty easy to parse; you check for the , character and append another record onto the row, check for the \n character to append this row to the table, and when you see "" you enter a special string-parsing mode which does not exit until it sees an odd number of quote marks pass by, bordered by two non-quote marks. (The fact that you might have to ""peek ahead"" leads to interesting parse combinators which have to be able to succeed or fail without moving the cursor forward.)<p>At one of my jobs I actually spent some time outside of work making CSV parsing faster by using a dangerous hack: you can split on the quote character first, to have the native string code handle the basic division of the table; then the even fields contain CSV data without quoted text (or occasionally empty strings, which must be interpreted as commands to add the quote character and the following text to the preceding field), and the odd fields contain raw data to be entered into a new record. (I call it a dangerous hack because I remember the thing working at first, but eventually I believe three bugs came out on more complicated CSV files -- it was very hard to ""see that it worked right"" due to the extra overhead needed to move all of this character-by-character logic into the split() calls of my programming language.",1329678218

Oracles's damages report getting stripped down does not seem to reduce the threat to the Android platform as a whole much at all, though it does reduce the short-term financial damage to Google.",1329678067

In fact, a mind boggling number of public libraries in the States alone, and more worldwide, not to mention trade schools, medical research institutions, etc.<p>Not only did he give the money to fund the library, but he only did so in cases where the town was ready to take on the burden of supporting it.<p>He was a man with an ego, but his generosity in this regard goes beyond ego. He was a man of virtue, who genuinely sought to see his fortune go back into society to make it a greater place. The amount of good he did boggles my mind and humbles me.<p>The abundance of public libraries in this country are not a result of liberalism in government. They are a result of liberalism in men's souls. So stop bitching about what other people are doing with their wealth, earned or unearned. That does not make you a better person.<p>In my opinion, the rich are not necessarily wrong to be abandoning the U.S. middle classes. I would not be surprised if that wealth is not sitting in Scrooge McDuck's money vaults, but is instead being funneled into the third world now, raising up people with a true appreciation for the sacredness of life and wealth, with more perspective and less entitlement.<p>Anyway, it doesn't matter. No, government has never been the solution. It has at best been a custodian, as it is with the public library system in the states. But every book in there, every microchip, and most of the buildings and maintenance are made of the lifeblood of hard working people who dedicated their life to creating more than they consumed.",1329678046

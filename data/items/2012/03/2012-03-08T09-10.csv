3679205,comment,3678439,3678596,0,0,chmike,,,"Too obvious! It's provocation. Soon or later Anons will make a mistake by getting out of their rabbit holes. These immediate hit back type of reactions is a weak point. 
In ""old Europe"" regions, where very old rooted cultural tradition of revenge behavior exist, a long delayed hit back has become the rule by Darwinian evolution process. 
Biological virus behaving like this with a long incubation delay while keeping their ability to contaminate others are the most harmful.<p>Anon's justifying their activity with good cause motives doesn't make sense. There are many other ways to act efficiently in favor of these good causes without using dark forces. These strategies have already been proven to be very effective. Consider Martin Luther King, Gandi, Mandela. One single man managed to push empires and systems on their knees and surrender. These people didn't use their fists, weapons or bombs and certainly didn't leverage their cause by terror on harming or killing innocent people.<p>My impression is that Anons are people who by their skills manage to take control of computers and have, by this, gained power to harm. There is a very thin and fuzzy line between getting control of things (neutral) and acting to harm and justifying it by a good cause.<p>The feeling one may have when getting such power in our hands make it very easy to fall on the dark force side. The good cause justifications are just tactics to neutralize their own consciousness. The more people they manage to convince by it, the stronger the muzzling of their own consciousness become.<p>If you take 5 minutes to think about it, you'll understand that there is not much difference with terrorist's rationale. The degree of harm is of course not comparable, but it is the same logical mechanism in play and which is obviously wrong in many ways. It has been proven to be a dead end for terrorists as well as for country leaders. It is just a matter of time.<p>If someone has truly the desire to act to make this world a better place and contribute to make change what has to change, then there are many more efficient methods that don't require to use dark forces. One of the thing that makes them more efficient is just because of that, they don't use dark force.",1331200726

After all C++ is all about performance - and linked-list is not!</i><p>No, thank you. Instead, why don't we try and understand the benefits and pitfalls of various data structures? Although linked lists may not be a great generic data structure, they can be incredibly useful for certain types of actions. Enumerating their strengths is a much more useful exercise than asserting sweeping generalizations.<p>As for your example: any stack or queue data structure is more efficiently implemented with a linked list than an array/vector.

I also go to the movies and buy the CDs of my favorite bands, but I only do so for content which is worth it. The biggest problem with movies is that you can't tell much about their quality from a trailer. And I also find the music industry to be disgusting lately, so I'm grateful to a couple of bands that kept their genre and that aren't subject to the latest trends.<p>For books I have a different behavior. The thing with my Kindle is that I can always download a couple of chapters to see if I actually like the author's style and if it's what I really want. Also I don't read more than 2-3 books per month, so I don't go on buying sprees, this reading habit of mine being actually cheap.<p>Therefore I only pirated one or two books for my Kindle at first, before I discovered the convenience of buying them straight from Amazon. It takes less time and reading the reviews of other people makes it valuable to visit the store first, then from there downloading a sample or buying it is just one click away.<p>So I do not believe that DRM-free books will be bad for authors. It's in fact quite the opposite for me, because when reading a book I end up being really grateful in case I like it, so I have this extreme urge to reward the author. And this happens for every book I read, because the selection process is extremely efficient, as I said, which makes paying for books a no-brainer.",1331199555

This is an awesome way to learn NumPy--by working the small examples at at the command line.

In the FBI, if I had a warrant to wiretap an individual on a terrorism matter and picked-up evidence of a non-terrorism-related crime, I could not, without FBI Headquarters and a judges approval, use that as evidence in a criminal case. But TSA is using its screening devices to carve out a niche business. According to congress, TSA began to seek out petty criminals without congressional approval.

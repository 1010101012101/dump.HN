Either way, it&#x27;s a big change to go from sitting all day to either walking or standing, and a good idea to blend it in to your work day slowly over a couple of weeks rather than force yourself to go whole hog from the the first day.<p>Now that I think about it, when I switched from sitting to walking, I got a tall sit/stand stool so I could switch a lot. It was a really cheap stool, and it put my butt and legs to sleep in 10-20 minutes. It was so uncomfortable that I would only use it when standing was starting to hurt, and I&#x27;d sit until sitting was starting to hurt, and then have to stand again.

9276223,comment,9275633,9275941,0,0,dheera,,,"Personally I think the pollution in China is one of the biggest finger-pointing games in history.<p>The main <i>reason</i> for the pollution in China, and Asia in general, is, above all things, consumer demand. In other words, it&#x27;s <i>us</i> as a world population, taking up consumerism so fast, from wasting energy at home to rampant manufacturing of useless consumer products (for the whole world, which demands them!) at under-market prices, to meat production, to added to a a local increase in car-centric culture in China built on an unsustainable fuel source. While all this was fine for the USA to some degree, which, mind you, is driven on 39% coal and 67% fossil fuels, this model of energy production simply <i>does not scale</i> and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s failing in Asia. Every time you take a car over public transit in Beijing, every time you leave an electronic device or light on, <i>you</i> are contributing to the pollution problem. Which is, unfortunately, pretty much everyone nowadays.<p>As much finger pointing happens at the Chinese government, in my opinion the true solution lies with scientists and engineers, not politicians. We need to completely re-visit even the most basic aspects of how we design cities, how we achieve mobility, how we live, work, and everything else, from the ground up. This is the first time the world has had 7 billion people, so history will not teach us how to cope with high population densities. Some kind of game-changing, modernized thinking on the most basic levels of civilization needs to happen.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say the government is completely absolved of fault. However, their job isn&#x27;t to &quot;fix&quot; the pollution issue -- what do you expect them to do? Cut everyone&#x27;s electricity? Force everyone to use only Tesla cars overnight? Cut all manufacturing exports to USA? Doing any of these would fix a good chunk of the pollution issue, but will cause quite a lot of upheaval and unrest. Rather, their job and focus should be in empowering those scientists and entrepreneurs with funding, space, tools, and freedom to come up with fixes that are sustainable in both environmental and business senses of the word.",1427464261

9276219,comment,9275733,9276159,0,0,Avalaxy,,,"Sure. Couple of scenarios where I&#x27;ve seen people working on a server and why that&#x27;s bad:<p>1) The developers in this company that work with ColdFusion develop their software on a dev server because they would otherwise require expensive licenses for each dev machine. This means that devs often find themselves editting the same file. It also means that one dev can break the software for all other devs. Last but not least, it makes version control a ton harder.<p>2) Another scenario is where you fix a bug on the production server to roll out a fix as soon as possible. Sometimes this is acceptable, but there&#x27;s a big risk because you no longer have the ability to test the code first. This also makes version control harder, because the next time you deploy your code, the changes will get overwritten.<p>3) Working with a remote IDE or just having your own development server: doesn&#x27;t really make any sense, most devices (laptops, PCs, tablets) can run some kind of IDE/editor locally and allow you to run the code locally.

Comedians tend to use this to craft some jokes and sometimes abuse folks.  For example, President Ford slipped a couple of times in slick shoes.  Chevy Chase made him out to be a klutz and un-athletic on SNL to great merriment.  President Ford was probably the most athletic President the US has had.  He played linebacker in American Football and was consider a decent athlete.<p>My Dad was not a fan of this and did tend to scold his children that &quot;if we were going to hate someone, we better damn well know why&quot;.

This means that things can&#x27;t change within the execution of a function.

Most other languages with immutability should probably instead have Rust-style mutation control, in my opinion, as it maintains almost all of the interesting properties of immutability in strict languages while being easier to program with, and easier to make high performance.",1427462823

If you put in a solid 6-8 hour day, then you&#x27;ve earned the right to let the rest go until tomorrow morning. I don&#x27;t take my work home with me -- it can wait. I don&#x27;t check my email when I&#x27;m at home -- it can wait. It&#x27;s not my fault my colleagues check their mail when they&#x27;re at home, and it&#x27;s not my fault my manager sets unreasonable expectations. I can only do so much, so when I&#x27;m done for the day, I&#x27;m done for the day.<p>Your mileage may vary, but whenever I feel the way you feel, I ask myself, &quot;Will anything change if I stay another 2 hours, or will it be exactly the same tomorrow morning, after a fresh night of sleep?&quot; and the answer is almost &quot;exactly the same.&quot; So I go home, have a nice dinner, relax with my girlfriend, and get a good night&#x27;s sleep so I&#x27;m ready to tackle the problem again the next day.<p>And if I&#x27;m ever in a situation where someone is harassing me to work extra hours for no extra pay, that&#x27;s the day I quit.<p>Work shouldn&#x27;t be stressful in a bad way. (There is such thing as good stress.) If it is, someone is being unreasonable -- it may be you, it may be your colleagues, it may be your boss, but either way, it&#x27;s time to step back and look at the big picture.<p>Can this wait until tomorrow?<p>Yes, it can.",1422687363

Before nuclear submarines, submarines spent most of their time on the surface and had surface ship hulls with a pointed keel and bow. USS Nautilus, the first nuclear submarine, was built that way as well. USS Albacore, which was not nuclear powered, was built as an experimental craft, designed to be fast and agile underwater.  Albacore had an control system set up for a single pilot, using an aircraft-like yoke. The pilot even wore a seat belt.<p>Albacore performed quite well, and the Skipjack class nuclear submarines (1959) were modeled on <i>Albacore</i>.  All later US (and Soviet) nuclear submarines followed that general shape.

But in the example (for humor), the browser does worry about SSH keys, because it is an SSH client.  &quot;Just use DNS with DNSSEC&quot; won&#x27;t work for direct IP addresses.  Using client side certs is unnecessary, as the trusted web server is only telling you the conditions under which it is okay to authenticate.  If you already trust the integrity of the data, it isn&#x27;t more dangerous (from a security standpoint) than when you you get a page over HTTPS that tells you to POST to /login.<p>Besides the fact that we both think that the browser as an SSH client is silly, I don&#x27;t think the suggestion of providing the fingerprint in DNS with DNSSEC is any more secure than a trusted web server providing it, but it would not work for direct IPs.",1422685794

After a few months of ramp up we signed six figures of contracts in a single month. Giddy as we were, we had worked together for years and knew deep down it wasn&#x27;t manageable. But dollars are very effective beer-goggles.<p>We laid out work-life expectations; mutual desires to work <40h/wk, how to manage clients, charge what we were worth, etc.<p>The biggest problem I blame myself for was the self-inflicted up-spiral of expectations, which sounds like what&#x27;s happening with you. It started with replying to one of my partner&#x27;s emails at 10pm, then turned into email conversations until 1am many nights/week with him and the clients. Emails about where I was, followed by texts and Slacks about if I got the emails, on and on.<p>I cannot speak for my partner, but in hindsight I would say that we had different business priorities and in the end, pleasing clients trumped balance for him and it didn&#x27;t for me.

Hong Kong Island has a density of 16,000/km2 but the actual urban area is around 20% of the island [0]. Housing really is densely packed (I haven&#x27;t ever seen people queuing for an elevator to get into their apartment building before), but I think I&#x27;d much prefer that to living in an urban sprawl where I have to drive 30 minutes to see something green.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong+Island,+Hong+Kong/@22.2443364,114.1888396,14152m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3404002b7e463e87:0xe4c58f8e0fb01840"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong+Island,+Hong+Kon...</a>",1422684343

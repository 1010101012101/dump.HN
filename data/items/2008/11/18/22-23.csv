It seems the only time this issue comes up is when people get tripped up by mutating simple [] or {} default parameters.<p>I would expect a default expression to be simple and pure. If this expression should only be executed once, requiring a programmer to be explicit about the complexity wouldn't be a bad thing.",1227048962

The pointer stuff looks suspicious, too, but I have not read far enough to know how awful it will be.""</i><p>If those are your only complaints, may I suggest Objective-J and Cappuccino... <a href=""http://cappuccino.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cappuccino.org</a> ;)<p>We have garbage collection (it's just JavaScript underneath), no header files, and no raw pointers (again, just JavaScript objects).<p>But pointers in Objective-C aren't really a big deal, you just have to be sure to declare your variables with the ""*"". After that they're just like objects in any other dynamic language.<p>As far as the ""pseudo-dynamic"" claim goes, it is indeed an interesting mix of dynamic and static. You can add new methods (in ""categories""), introspect objects for their methods, etc. If you don't want static typing just declare all your variables as ""id"".<p>The more I learn about Objective-C the more I find it to be a very elegant language. It's pretty amazing how 20 years ago they were able to take a very rigid non-dynamic language, C, and turn it into something so dynamic. Even 20 years later Objective-C and Cocoa are still very modern language/framework combo (granted it has been updated by Apple over the years).",1227048530

368853,comment,368580,368798,0,0,jerf,,,"""Is that by design"" - Well, yes and no. Try to forget the specific context for the moment.<p>It is by design that the default parameter to a function parameter is evaluated only once, as the alternative has bad performance implications.<p>It is by design that when you have a reference, that modifications to that value are still available on the same reference. (That is, Python has mutable objects with a couple of immutable exceptions.) This is obviously a fairly normal choice, very basic to the language design.<p>Now, take these two normal things together and you get that if you make your default function parameter a mutable object, it'll be the same mutable object every time. The relevant ""import this"" aphorism would be ""Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.""<p>So, is this ""by design""? Well, not <i>directly</i>, it's a natural consequence of other aspects of the design. All languages have corner cases of one sort or another. Making this an exception would itself be a wart, after all:<p><pre><code>      l = []\n      def f(param = l): pass\n      def g(param = []): pass\n</code></pre>\nShouldn't f and g have similar behavior? If you propose that the value be evaluated every time, they won't, and then people would complain about that, too.",1227047939

Yegge, my current boss, and one of my co-workers fit this mold.  They type very fast, and I frequently have no idea what their writing is about, or am annoyed with the excess verbiage.<p>The best writing is re-writing.  The best coding is refactoring.  In both coding and writing the bottleneck is going through what you've written two or three times and making the necessary edits and stopping to think.  First pass typing speed is absolutely not the bottleneck to producing anything of quality.  If you want to churn out unreadable or unmaintainable crap, belting out functions at 90 wpm and then moving right on is a good way to go.",1227047912

All compensation and credit should be structured to further this goal.<p>I guess 100% is the best way to structure it. Possibly even with a disclaimer saying the founder would not create any company out of the source code - but could be hired by anyone who does. The founder's role would then, simply, be an evangelist for the project(s).<p>I think the last four people would participate in the hopes of entering the top six, but a more open plan would probably encourage more participation.

Trying to undermine the assumptions of an existing framework has a tendency to cause subtle hard to detect bugs.

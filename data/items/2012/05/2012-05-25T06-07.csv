The unlock was fixed (and subsequent unlocks have not taken similar risks) and Apple seriously scrambled to release a second upgrade that fixed those devices.)<p>(And yes: ""scrambled"" is the right word for their reaction; in addition to them having large numbers of sad customers, it is actually /illegal/ in many major countries to pull the shenanigans you seem to believe Apple had a part in, and a class-action lawsuit was immediately put together by people who refused to believe it was just a mistake.)<p>As for your assertion that they kick companies that do things with Cydia around, that is absurd: major applications like uStream and Qik have either been cross-listed in both markets or launched on jailbroken devices first; Tapululous even has been on stage with Jobs, and they are the reason many users jailbroke on iPhoneOS 1.x.<p>Meanwhile, Apple actually did /not/ file opposition to the DCMA exemption this year: in fact, at the hearings (which I attended and even answered a question at), it was specifically brought up how none of the players with actual skin in te game (such as Apple or manufacturers of Android devices) care enough to participate this year.<p>Finally, Apple certainly won't help you with software issues (or even certain classes of hardware issues) of you are currently jailbroken, but they could easily blacklist your warranty, and yet they simply don't: I have never heard of someone being denied service by Apple unless they both refuse to restore their device (to see if jailbreaking caused the problem).<p>So, while I don't actually agree with the person you are responding to (that Apple actively allows the process), your post is sufficiently full of lies and FUD that you are not adding anything useful to the conversation by having responded. :(",1337928197

They either innovate, keep pushing themselves, or they'll end up steamrollered by someone else.<p>Remember that in 1995 people did line up to buy Windows 95 and while future launches weren't met with as much fanfare, people would actively seek out computers with Windows on it and had no time for side-show attractions like MacOS or Linux.<p>Amazing how that can come collapsing down just because of a few mis-steps. You have Vista, you have a near decade of focusing aggressively on the server market and leaving the consumer side to twist in the wind, neglecting their important and dominant Internet Explorer product for the better part of six years.<p>In other words, Apple is just one Steve Ballmer away from total irrelevance.<p>The company best situated to take down Apple doesn't exist yet, not in the form it will ultimately be.

Being sent messages by the framework is what makes it a framework and not a library; I don't get your objection here.</i><p>If it was a framework modelled in an object oriented way it would itself be built of classes exchanging messages, but it isn't. It encourages you to also structure your code in a non object oriented way by creating hundreds of little services which are basically procedure calls instead of making your model accept a wider variety of messages or instead of building classes with more than just a ""call"" method. Most of the code is supposed to go directly into the services, that's the whole point of the framework, remember it is a solution to the ""fat model"" problem:<p><i>One in particular is something I've been thinking about and refining for a while now [3]. In this approach, persistence objects remain extremely thin, and business logic is encapsulated in lots of very simple objects known as services and policies.</i><p>Also, keep in mind that the services do not normally call each other (they could in theory, but that would be even more awkward), so instead of having message exchange between models you have duplicated code in services or have to use inheritance. Ruby is object oriented so sure there are message calls further down, it doesn't make the framework object oriented on the logical level.<p><i>Only if you're conflating domain objects with persistence objects.</i><p>Must you go as far as to refer to a hypothetical reality just to win an argument ;) ? That's how Rails works, that's what the examples show, I am not referring to what is possible in theory, but to what the framework does and the most reasonable possible way of using it. Honestly one more level of indirection would make this look completely ridiculous.<p><i>They're statically dispatched on a constant name, not on a class. If you need polymorphism at that point, it's trivial to define a dynamic service resolver - all you need is something with a #new method assigned to the constant to do whatever late binding you want.</i><p>Ehm, no? You cannot just define a ""new"" method returning whatever you want neither in a module nor in a class in Ruby. You would have to overwrite the initialization methods that are usually hidden from the user. Passing a constant name is almost equivalent to passing a class.<p><pre><code>  module Foo
    def new
      5

  end

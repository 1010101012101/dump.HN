Hanja recorded meaning alone, not sound, and only aristocrats knew it. So the king and his literary circle crafted an alphabet from scratch and started promoting it in 1446. Known as hangul, it consists of 24 elements that can be grouped into blocks of syllables. Some take the shape that lips and tongue form in speech. It is fantastically easy to learn. The 80,000 speakers of the Cia-Cia language are also being encouraged to use the script on the Indonesian island of Buton.<p>Hanja lingered for centuries after the introduction of hangul. Nobles scorned the newfangled alphabet as being for peasants, women and children. But after the end of over three decades of Japanese occupation in 1945, the governments in both South and North Korea promoted hangul fiercely, ordering that hanja be expunged from all texts and no longer taught in schools.<p>Today hanja pepper South Korean newspapers, while older South Koreans still use them to write their names. But hangul is a source of patriotic pride. As North Koreans were preparing this week to mark the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party with the usual display of bellicosity, the South had a day off to celebrate something indigenous, brilliant and pacific—their alphabet.<p>The annual October 9th holiday, scrapped in 1991 at employers’ request, was reinstated in 2013. Woo Eun-kyung, a hotelier in Seoul, feels “pride and gratitude” when Hangul Day comes around. Kim Ki-beom, a young lawyer, frets that Korean is being “destroyed by alien words”. A national day, he says, helps to keep the language intact; he laments a preference for English signs on streets.<p>Still, Mr Kim admits the holiday is firstly a welcome respite from long office hours. It is also a way to entice South Koreans to splurge. One alien word now doing the rounds is beulfe, a conflation of “Black Friday”, America’s huge autumn sale, transliterated into hangul. The government has prodded 27,000 shops to slash prices in the first half of October to pep up sluggish consumer spending; in four days Lotte, a department store, sold almost a quarter more than a year earlier. Electronics and clothes are much in demand—another way for South Koreans to express themselves.",1444586387

Typing short lines of text.  (And anticipating a quick response.)  Seems reasonable to make a comparison to using the command line.<p>IRC, or today&#x27;s &quot;chat&quot;, is also arguably similar.  Typing short lines of text, and expecting a quick response.<p>I have wondered about this for years as SMS and later Twitter, and now &quot;enterprise chat&quot;, i.e., typing short lines of text, became popular.<p>But winning a popularity contest for how people interact with a computer is not something that really interests me.<p>My prediction based on last 30 years of computing history is that command line interface is never going to disappear (that is one reason I stick with it).  It is there for whomever may discover and choose to use it.<p>&quot;They don&#x27;t even know what they don&#x27;t know.&quot;<p>Exactly.<p>And yet countless GUI lovers/CLI haters continually ask us to believe that some hypothetical user would _choose_ not use a command line interface when they do not even know that such a thing exists; they were never given a real choice.<p>Who cares what other users want to use?  It is their choice, not yours.<p>Give them a choice a see what happens.<p>Experiment.",1444586324

10370222,comment,10366594,10370060,0,0,sparkzilla,,,"I&#x27;m not really sure how giving writers an opportunity to use their time as an investment demeans them, but perhaps I&#x27;ve read your post the wrong way. There are three ways to get people involved: 1. Pay them directly; make a system where they work for free for a noble cause; or let them invest their time now with the hope of larger revenue-share payments later. This latter way actually empowers contributors by treating them like investors.<p>I see no difference between an investor putting in $1000 in cash, and a contributor investing $1000 of their time, because all we would do with the investors $1000 would be to pay the contributors. In the case where the investor adds cash, as the company grows the investor gets the long-term rewards, while the writer just gets paid $1000 and has no long-term position. However, when the contributor invests their time, we don&#x27;t need the investor. Instead, the contributor gets the long-term reward for their work as the value of their content rises. So rather than consigning contributors to a fixed wage and giving the benefit of their work to investors, we allow writers to invest in their own future. Of course, that all depends on whether they think the business will grow so that a decent amount of revenue can be shared.<p>As I pointed out above, many of the work-at-home workers need to get instant cash so this system doesn&#x27;t work for them, and the Wikipedia people will work for free (the fools!). Our challenge is to recruit people who are willing to treat their participation as an investment. But if it works, they will make a lot more money than they would in any other system.",1444586143

Heck it was even an issue for 1st party Samsung software anything that didn&#x27;t run in a VM had to be compiled/redeveloped for Exynos which meant that even software like Samsung GearVR didn&#x27;t work on Exynos devices initially.<p>Which is precisely why i think that a uniform compatible ISA and design from an investment consortium is required for ARM to work out it&#x27;s kinks and take on the server market. Anything that was compiled for x86 for the past what 30 years will work on Intel&#x27;s current CPU lines. Yes newer CPU&#x27;s with additional features, extended instruction sets and their respective supported compilers will enable you to run you software more efficiently if you want to invest additional development resources, but if we talk about low level programming the same cannot be said for ARM in all cases which is a big issue at least as I see it.",1444585504

In large networks, it&#x27;s still often the case that k is proportional to n (most people have less than 1000 facebook friends, so we can bound k by 1000n...), so this is still linear in n.<p>I tend to see lots of graph algorithms which run in O(n^3) time, which tends to be fine for medium-sized data sets, but yeah, breaks down when you get into the 10,000+ sized data sets.<p>And then there&#x27;s &#x27;matrix&#x27; methods you mention.  These can often be tied to an area called algebraic graph theory, which looks at properties of matrices (like the adjacency matrix) to try to pull out information about the graph.  Relaxing the graph problem and allowing the full range of matrix operations allows some fast linear algebraic methods to be used, though the final solution may need some massaging to make sense, and may not be perfectly optimal.<p>A great example of this is spectral clustering, which uses eigenvectors of a relative of the adjacency matrix to perform a clustering of the graph&#x27;s nodes.  The optimization that the clustering is solving is actually an (iirc) NP-hard problem; casting it as an eigenvalue problem gives an O(n^2) approximation of a solution, which then gets hammered into something we can live with...",1444584712

Yes, it&#x27;s technically true that if the oppressed Jews had a lot more guns, they might have lasted longer, or took more Germans with them, or survived the war or something. But the real issue is more the mindset and culture they had than the weapons and the laws around them.<p>First, it bears repeating that the vast majority of Jews killed were Polish, not German. This never really was a matter of not paying attention to the political progress of anti-semitism in your own country, but rather that your crazy neighbors get crazier and crazier and eventually invade your country and turn it upside-down.<p>The real problem is that the Polish Jews always had to deal with a relatively low-level anti-semitism, and their strategy of being meek and going along always worked well enough for them. They had been doing it for so long that even when the Nazis invaded and changed everything virtually overnight, there was no real widespread movement for resistance until it was much too late. If it had been legal for them to buy and own guns, they wouldn&#x27;t have bothered, and if they had them, they would have given them up without a peep long before.<p>I suppose you could say that the even deeper root of the problem is the belief that It Can&#x27;t Happen Here. The Nazis did indeed try hard to hide the facts of what they were doing, but they were greatly helped by the fact that pretty much nobody really believed that such industrialized mass-murder could happen in a first-world, civilized country. Even with the massive levels of documentation produced, there are plenty of people who still don&#x27;t believe that it happened.<p>But the facts on the ground there went on to fuel history in another direction. Jewish shame at how passively they were led to the slaughter in Europe fueled their will to flout British colonial immigration laws in moving to what was then British Palestine, found a nation and an army, desperately build or buy weapons from any possible source, and successfully defend it against all comers over and over again. They were also helped in no small part by Western diplomatic backing, fueled by shame at not having done enough to prevent the Holocaust from happening.<p>In the end, having the materiel and skills to defend yourself is good, but having the knowledge that you might need to and the will to go through with it is more important. Without that, any armaments you do have will evaporate before they can make a difference, and with it, you can find a way to buy or make some kind of weapons, even if it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as if you had gotten them beforehand.",1444583258

You pair program with different people each day to work through workshops. You work in groups on projects, but everyone pulls their weight and it isn&#x27;t at all what I had experience in groups in college. If you don&#x27;t know how to work in a group, then you don&#x27;t know everything you need to get a job. Pairing and working on teams is going to be your life as a programmer, so you are going to need to learn it. If you are at all interested and it is something you can do I&#x27;d highly recommend applying. It will push you to work with people, but it is a supportive community that&#x27;ll insure you do well.",1444582992

It&#x27;s a different philosophy to statically typed languages<p>The only real benefit to this appears to be some shortcuts that shave a few characters off and do so, IMO, at the expense of readability.<p>E.g. this reads easier for me:<p><pre><code>    len([x for x in xs if x > 10])\n</code></pre>\nThan this does:<p><pre><code>    sum(x > 10 for x in xs)\n</code></pre>\nMartelli may call this stuff contortions but to me it feels more natural.",1444582959

They will just pass on the customer&#x27;s proposed solution and insist that you build it.<p>It&#x27;s actually a bit worse than that. Customers almost never <i>know</i> their problems; instead, they <i>understand</i> their problems through the accumulated knowledge of their profession, and have a very hard time stepping out of “the way things are done” to nail down their ultimate goals.<p>One of our biggest challenges as developers is that software engineering is very much a meta-profession: Being fully competent in computer science is only useful if you can apply that competence to real-world problems, and that inevitably means having to become expert enough in a field to which you may never have had any exposure.<p>A good PM understands this and turns development into an iterative process in a tight loop with customer feedback: You push the project forward a little, check with customers, apply their feedback, and lather-rinse-repeat until you&#x27;ve come up with a good solution—one that typically <i>innovates</i> on the status quo.<p>A bad PM tries to spec everything ahead of schedule and never really gets off the ground, her best possible outcome being automating existing processes at the tail end of a waterfall-induced nightmare.<p>A worse PM is overwhelmed and avoids nailing down details, seeks no customer involvement, and leaves things to fester for weeks without any feedback. I don&#x27;t know anyone who enjoys being on the poor team tasked with dealing with that kind of work.<p>Incidentally, this is what I&#x27;ve always taken agile development to mean: It&#x27;s not about stand-ups and kanban boards, but rather about acknowledging and embracing the fact that programming is an inherently inexact science.",1444582892

This has been getting more and more supportive evidence from adoption studies (including separated twins incidents), use of surrogates, egg and sperm donors show very little correlation between pure genetics and IQ or academic performance.<p>This is, to put it charitably, not the consensus of the relevant science. Once you get adequate nutrition, which western countries have, IQ if influenced far more by genetics than environment. Adoption studies show consistently that adopted children&#x27;s IQs resemble their genetic parents not their adopted parents. Twins separated at birth tend to have very similar IQs and personalities. Programs like Head Start and brain training regimens have proven to have little impact on IQ and future outcomes - which you wouldn&#x27;t expect if environment was the prime factor. We are biological robots, we should expect our source code to have a significant influence on our cognition.<p>The &quot;environment is all that matters&quot; idea is basically Lysenkoism and its popularity is more do to ideology than science. Your statements are from a mirror world. I assure you, you&#x27;re misinformed.",1444582831

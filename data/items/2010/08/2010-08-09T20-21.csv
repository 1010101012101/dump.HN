You’d have to go out of your way to obtain fructose without the accompanying glucose. Sucrose is half fructose and half glucose. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is nearly identical to sucrose in structure and function. Here’s the point I’m getting at: contrary to Lustig’s contentions, both of these compounds have substantial research showing not just their ability to elicit an insulin response, but also their suppressive effect on appetite [3-6].<p>But wait, there’s more. In studies directly comparing the effect of fructose and glucose preloads on subsequent food intake, one showed no difference [7], while the majority have shown the fructose preload resulting in lesser food intake than the glucose preload [8-10]. A recent review of the literature on fructose’s effect on satiety found no compelling case for the idea that fructose is less satiating than glucose, or that HFCS is less satiating than sucrose [11]. So much for Lustig’s repeated assertion that fructose and fructose-containing sugars increase subsequent food intake. I suppose it’s easier to sensationalize claims based on rodent data.""",1281387211

I didn't bother to read all of them, but for example, according to the first one:<p><i>During the first 6 months, the low-carbohydrate diet group had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lesser reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and more adverse symptoms than did the low-fat diet group. The low-carbohydrate diet group had greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at all time points, approximating a 23% increase at 2 years. Limitation: Intensive behavioral treatment was provided, patients with dyslipidemia and diabetes were excluded, and attrition at 2 years was high. Conclusion: Successful weight loss can be achieved with either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet when coupled with behavioral treatment. A low-carbohydrate diet is associated with favorable changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors at 2 years. </i><p>Not sure what they mean by ""adverse symptoms,"" but generally I read that as: low carb is better for your heart.<p>By all means, don't trust my personal anecdote or what Dr. Davis has to say on the matter (though I do recommend reading through his blog, as he does stay abreast of the literature and often refers to new studies, and he does have tons of empirical evidence via his patients.) Trust really isn't required, when it's easy enough to run your own experiments: simply eliminate wheat/grains/potatoes/juice/etc... for a few months and see what happens.

Thanks to Prop 13, which prevented property taxes from increasing except when a property is sold, they're very unevenly distributed. In essence, we have a subsidy on old homeowners paid for by new homeowners. Not only has this starved local governments of revenue traditionally used to pay for schools, police and other municipal services, but it has badly distorted the housing market.<p>For example, my parents bought a house in Santa Cruz, CA for about $100,000 in the 1970s. Before the housing crash, the house was probably worth more than 8x that. This makes it very difficult to move, because if they did their property taxes would go up almost an order of magnitude. The problem is even worse with commercial real estate, which can stay in the same hands for decades.<p>Without repealing Prop 13 and making our tax system more equitable, we cannot reduce the high property/sales taxes that currently pay for municipal government.",1281387049

1589322,comment,1586932,1587007,0,0,_wdh,,,"In EVE, players can pay real money for an ingame item called a PLEX. A PLEX can either be sold ingame to another player for pretend EVE money (called ISK) or used up by the player for an extra month subscription. In this way, players can either pay real money for ISK  or pay ISK for extra subscription time. A recent patch allows players to move these items about in the game world (before they were locked in the station).<p>In EVE, players fly spaceships about. There are different classes of spaceship, but the smallest and weakest ship are called frigates. They are also by far the most common ships to see in EVE as they are the only ships that can be flown by new players.<p>EVE also permits (and encourages) player on player combat. When a player's ship is destroyed, there is a random dice roll for each item in cargo to decide if the item will survive. Surviving items are dropped into the game world and can be taken by other players. Therefore players can attack other players and steal their items. This is normally done by a gang of pirate players who wait at the stargates that act as bottlenecks between areas. These pirates scan passing ships to see what cargo they are holding and if it's worth it, they attack. Mostly they attack large cargo ships, not beginners frigates as the loot you get from a beginning player doesn't outweigh the costs of attacking a ship.<p>What's happened here is that one player (probably working for some sort of large ingame player run group) was trying to move PLEX around (probably for profit, the market is player run and prices are different from area to area) in a weak frigate in an attempt to avoid attention, assuming that pirates would not bother scanning a tiny frigate. If it works it's a very cheap and easy way to move items about. In practice the pirates much have cargo scanned the frigate and then attacked it, seeking to steal the PLEX's. However the PLEX's were destroyed by an unlucky dice roll, robbing the pirates of their loot.",1281386917

It is a bit like saying the judiciary is independent but the president can set the salary of any individual judge.<p>I do not quite understand to be honest why would we need the FCC to be a middle man and why would the Non Discriminatory paragraph not grant rights to individuals. Any other entity than the court is very different. A court has the protection of contempt of court, it has the luxury of developing the law through applying it to specific cases, and its independence is enshrined in law and in the culture of the judiciary.<p>The whole statement is engaged in double speak and you would really need to be a lawyer to understand they are fooling people. The FCC might take test cases to court, but being a test case the court would be much more confined than if it was a specific case. So it would have to interpret the provisions strictly, including what does meaningful harm mean, which was downvoted in another comment but when you are dealing with the law such a thing as meaningful has quite a significance. You aren't talking to your friend and yeah we get the idea. You are trying to apply the law to facts and the facts can be very diverse and to find that meaningful threshold where it differs with insignificance takes many years and many highest level court judgements.<p>That is only one point.

I'd much prefer a discussion like this to a buried comment, regardless of the merit of the original comment. Perhaps it was due to the perceived tone of your comment: ""I don't understand why anyone would think it would be impossible"" ~= ""Who would be dumb enough to assume this isn't possible?"" As for why anyone would claim the task is impossible - not enough imagination! :) Although it's more likely that they meant they thought it was impossible to achieve at a decent speed/framerate, which is a pretty reasonable assumption at first glance.<p>Technically, I think you're right - you could implement a pseudolayering system with only one canvas element. The limiting factor, however, is redrawing speed. You have essentially two options - every time a layer moves, you could redraw the entire canvas, which is conceptually easy but slow. Or you could do some calculation to determine exactly which pixels need to be redrawn - as you say, a matrix operation to determine a delta matrix. This may be faster than redrawing the entire canvas, but it gets much slower as you increase the number of layers. Speed may not seem like a huge issue here, but imagine clicking a layer and dragging it around - this would require constant (un-hardware-accelerated) canvas redrawing at ~10-30fps, which is probably pretty difficult to achieve with any significantly-sized canvas.<p>The brilliant canvas-on-top-of-canvas implementation avoids this problem altogether. While the layer being dragged still has to be redrawn, the process of doing so is made a lot easier because you don't have to shuffle around the data in the other layers in the process, you just have to worry about one layer at a time.",1281386614

He used the example of Manning in Iraq (who was allegedly inside a SCIF, but consciously violated security policy, whether or not you think what he did was right) -- the purpose of all of that is to make sure your honest and trustworthy employees aren't accidentally compromising sensitive information, and to protect from outsiders.  You don't body cavity search your own cleared engineers because that is not generally the threat, and it's highly invasive.<p>There is information protected against willful disclosure by trusted individuals, and that information is kept inside a hardware security module and/or is never accessible to individuals.  e.g. nuclear weapons have a ""no lone zone"" around them, such that if any person (even the commander of the base) is in that space alone, he is presumed to be doing something evil, and is supposed to be stopped (using lethal force if necessary) on sight.<p>That level of security just isn't warranted for most things, but ""work on material in a secure room, and the information doesn't leave the room except by defined channels"" is a pretty good level of security.  DoD has a lot of security vulnerabilities, but security would not be improved by allowing telecommuting!",1281384640

However, they necessarily fund the healthcare industry at a lower level than people would on their own. Some of these savings come from actual improvements in efficiency and the elimination of marketing costs, but the rest comes from the government using its monopsony power to drive down prices. Some see this as a feature, but I see it as a bug. It results in less investment going towards improvements in the field, which I think is undesirable.

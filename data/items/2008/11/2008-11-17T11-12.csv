PHP just doesn't have the right abstractions needed to create truly good code.  Having some OO support is better than having none at all, but it's clear that the authors of PHP never bothered to try any object system other than Java's -- easily the worst object system of any language.  (Also, I would love to know why a language with no type checking has Java-style interfaces.  What is the point?)<p>Combine that with the lack of anonymous functions, closures, continuations, lexically-scoped variables, and so on, and you are stuck compromising your design to get something that is actually implementable.  It is sort of like a brilliant novelist that is used to writing with his laptop, but is given some napkins and a dull pencil instead.  Since he's a great author, he'll probably make something good -- but just give him his laptop back already.",1226923160

It seems mad to me to sign away 38% of ones income indefinitely (like, for decades), and this sounds as if people have been giving away even more. Is that normal?<p>Time to invest in better maths education in school???",1226922788

366795,comment,366587,366609,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>I noticed recently that playing games like Rockband leave me much more mentally fired up</i><p>I think it could have something to do with the music.  I've been playing Geometry Wars 2 a lot recently simply because I enjoy the music so much.  After I finish the ""Sequence"" mode, it is very hard to come down from the ""high"" -- the combination of exciting music and intense concentration is something I really enjoy.  Compare this to games like Mass Effect that are fun, but I don't really feel <i>stimulated</i>... it's more like watching TV.<p>Anyway, it's too bad that many people dismiss video games as toys for kids and never get to experience this.",1226922397

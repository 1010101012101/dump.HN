9761716,comment,9761569,9761569,0,0,Nadya,,,"<i>>Software development is historically driven by a population that values intelligence above all else.</i><p>Yes. Because we aren&#x27;t sexists or racists that give people&#x27;s code inherent value based on someone&#x27;s gender or race. How the irony is lost on these people, I will never understand.<p>If you wish to be racist/sexist and judge people based on their race and gender instead of their code, feel free to start your own project. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be open source and you can even deny all code contributions from cis-white males if you wish.<p>><i>In the Ruby world, we insist that “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice,” ignoring the sexist statements he has made with regard to diversity outreach efforts.</i><p>Not even sexist [0]. Speakers were chosen <i>without name or gender released</i> (a blind-pick system). <i>Introducing discrimination</i> into such a system is...well... discriminatory. I thought the point of diversity was to not discriminate based on race and gender?<p>If there were more &#x27;minority&#x27; Ruby devs there would be more submissions for speakers by &#x27;minority&#x27; Ruby devs, meaning a higher chance of being selected in a blind-pick. The lack of diversity is more due to statistics than an intentional lack of diversity. A blind-pick system also reduces any biases that may occur for picking person A over person B.<p>I find all this political garbage mixing into OSS to be hilarious. I&#x27;ve contributed a number of (small) fixes and changes to open source projects. The funny thing is that my name, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, and even my religion <i>didn&#x27;t matter at all</i>. In fact, it was never even brought up! Nobody asked me if I was even human, as my avatar was a fish. They simply reviewed my code, had me fix a few formatting errors (I have a habit of hitting space after the last sentence of a paragraph, which carries over into my code), and they accepted the pull requests. No questions asked.<p>Not sure how you can get any more diverse than &quot;anyone who wishes to contribute code, can contribute code&quot;. Is it by discriminating against who can contribute code? Seems counter-intuitive.<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/380394450746216448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/380394450746216448</a>",1435013923

Furthermore, the only thing that differentiates a hash-map from an ordered array is the existence of only keys in the range [1, ∞) (and they must be entirely contiguous starting from 1 until the last present key).<p>The interface for arrays and hash-map data types is uniform, called a &#x27;table&#x27;, which has your standard `mapper[key] = value` syntax (and also, equivalently, `mapper.key = value` for well-formatted string-literal keys).<p>This results in the very surprising and confounding fact that if a naive programmer doesn&#x27;t realize that Lua has this system, they will very likely end up starting from 0 and build an unordered hash map rather than an ordered array - complete with all the resulting performance penalties and unordered traversals.<p>For a long time this struck me as being absolutely absurd and very damning.

9761696,comment,9761352,9761352,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nice ad, not.<p>It is interesting to look at server utilization, Google had a very publicized plan for power driven computing (basically you switched on more machines as you needed them, turned them off when they were idle). Which kind of works and kind of doesn&#x27;t when you consider the complete picture of computational dynamics. Of the many resources requires (memory, compute, storage, and networking) only compute is easily &quot;turned off&quot; and &quot;turned on&quot; again. Next best is memory with many non-server memory systems allowing for a low power standby mode, disks and networks are both pretty much a massive latency hit when powered down.<p>And oddly latency is the fidelity of internet interaction. We think of things with low latency and rapid response as &quot;good&quot; and things which have high latency and slow response as &quot;bad&quot;. Just as an amplifier with poor frequency response is &#x27;muddy&#x27; and one that has high frequency response &#x27;crisp&#x27;.  At scale your idle machine are essentially latency capacitors waiting for that sudden burst of packets that happens during the commercial breaks.<p>It is an area that is ripe for improvement but it needs some pretty deep thinking to go along with that.",1435013396

We have such a limited understanding of our own emotion and cognition that it is impossible to say that we have proven anything about how compatible emotion is with computation.  Hands are continually waved over the existence of qualia and the argument, like you presented yourself, is that we have no way of proving that qualia won&#x27;t exist for an artificial intelligence that has been programmed for emotional compatibility.  I believe that is a fallacy, and it is side-stepping the root of the argument about qualia, and the real root of what self-realization and consciousness is.  By saying, look I can make this machine do everything you do and act as if it feels like you do, you are not proving that you have encapsulated all that is cognition.  You are only proving that you can mimic cognition.  It could be retorted &quot;Well how do you know this machine doesn&#x27;t really feel like you feel?&quot;  I don&#x27;t know that.

It doesn&#x27;t get more &#x27;statement of political dissent&#x27; than that. What happened to him was unquestionably outrageous and a gross violation of his civil liberties - he was reported by an agent of the Army Counterintelligence Corps who was present(!!) and then charged and convicted.<p>How well does this case compare? Some asshats on a fringe forum mouthed off about murdering a judge because they didn&#x27;t like the judge&#x27;s verdict. I&#x27;d bet that then some other, similarly judgement-impaired indivdual reported them to the authorities. What follows is predictable - said authorities, ever paranoid of being accused of having failed to &#x27;connect the dots&#x27;, put the gears in motion resulting in silly subpoenas, some dickish behaviour by a federal prosecutor and a publication&#x27;s inability to talk about the investigation for two weeks. Potentially, some imprudent ranters might get to chat with an FBI agent of which nothing will come.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue this is somehow an awesome outcome or that it doesn&#x27;t, once again, highlight some worrisome problems with the power of prosecutors and its potential for abuse. But I just don&#x27;t see the outrageous abuse of civil liberties, chilling effect, etc the tone of all of popehat&#x27;s writing on the topic implies.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to recognize the problem law enforcement, investigators, procecutors face in such situations - while zillions of internet hyperventilators fill message boards with their threatening but ultimately harmless nonsense, so do the microscopic minority who actually turn out to be violent.

I&#x27;m reminded of the crazy incentives in the Soviet Union.<p>EG, from SSC [1]<p>> A tire factory had been assigned a tire-making machine that could make 100,000 tires a year, but the government had gotten confused and assigned them a production quota of 150,000 tires a year. The factory leaders were stuck, because if they tried to correct the government they would look like they were challenging their superiors and get in trouble, but if they failed to meet the impossible quota, they would all get demoted and their careers would come to an end. They learned that the tire-making-machine-making company had recently invented a new model that really could make 150,000 tires a year. In the spirit of Chen Sheng, they decided that since the penalty for missing their quota was something terrible and the penalty for sabotage was also something terrible, they might as well take their chances and destroy their own machinery in the hopes the government sent them the new improved machine as a replacement. To their delight, the government believed their story about an “accident” and allotted them a new tire-making machine. However, the tire-making-machine-making company had decided to cancel production of their new model. You see, the new model, although more powerful, weighed less than the old machine, and the government was measuring their production by kilogram of machine. So it was easier for them to just continue making the old less powerful machine. The tire factory was allocated another machine that could only make 100,000 tires a year and was back in the same quandary they’d started with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/</a>",1435011271

the compilation process is not so easy: you need to understand the compilation of normal languages, in particular stack layout, and then add more pointers.

This is quite rich material, and not even usually covered in undergraduate compilers courses.<p>The situation with concurrency is much worse, but that only
reflects the fact that this is far from a solved problem on many
levels. To cite a recent paper [3]:
&quot;Despite decades of research, we do not have [in 2015] a satisfactory concurrency semantics for any general-purpose programming language that aims to support  concurrent systems code [...] Disturbingly, 40+ years after the  first relaxed-memory hardware was introduced (the IBM 370/158MP), the field still does not have a credible proposal for the  concurrency semantics of any general-purpose high-level language  that includes high-performance shared-memory concurrency primitives. This is a major open problem for programming language semantics.&quot;<p>And memory models are but one issue to deal with in
concurrency.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a><p>[2] A.

I&#x27;ve written vast amounts of Ocaml and C/C++, certainly over 100K LoCs in each. Programming in ML dialects is so much easier than C/C++, it&#x27;s not funny.  I&#x27;d estimate it takes me about 10 times longer to implement the same functionality in C/C++ than in an ML dialect. The three key features enabling this difference are the following.<p>* Garbage collection, removes all memory bugs, avoids tons of ugly and distracting (de)allocation commands and keeps your head free to think about more important stuff.<p>* Pattern matching, enables you to code up complex decision making code (and most functinality needs this) in a readable and maintainable way.<p>* higher-order functions allow you to parameterise code with behaviour in a neat way.<p>(There is one caveat, which is code for extremely high performance, I&#x27;d probably write that in C/C++, but this is not an issue concerning a learner.)<p>As to useless car analogies, I think implementing lambda in C is like saying: Today I&#x27;m going to learn how to build a car.

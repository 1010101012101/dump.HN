Age, gender, disabilities. So what?<p>As a teenage programmer, I can say that teenage programmers aren't that uncommon any more. It's not remarkable, age really doesn't matter. Anyone over the age of 10 can learn programming by taking programming courses from world-renown universities nowdays. I'm 16 and I've been programming for years. That's only because I had a chance to learn programming and I took it, not because I'm more intelligent than a someone who's 20 years older than me and only got a computer when he was 18.

4739772,comment,4739649,4739649,16,0,arbuge,,,"Good lawyers don't advertise (always a golden rule) but are often mentioned in searchable online media. A good technique (imho) for lawyer selection in any given major city is to collect a list of the most prominent lawyers in the specialization area of interest, and interview all of them. There will usually be fewer than a dozen candidates if you've done decent research & narrowing down. At some point in the interview ask who they would personally recommend as a lawyer if they couldn't recommend themselves. Then see where the answers converge.<p>This does take a few days and in a country like India might take even longer. So if you need somebody in a few hours it could be useless advice. If you can find somebody for initial representation and then switch to somebody else later, it might be more applicable.",1352036977

But it's different.<p>Pricing behind the curve means you base the price of your product on the average component cost over the life time instead of your actual current cost. Microsoft does that with the Xbox. In effect you subsidise the early models and make up for that in the long run. It's a valid strategy to gain market share quickly and does not hurt consumers.<p>Dumping means you subsidise your own product to push competitors out of business. It does hurt competition in the long run if done effectively. Dumping is illegal and you can get into a lot of trouble if you are found doing it.<p>Since the competing companies are not accusing anyone of dumping, I think it is safe to say no dumping is currently going on.",1352036921

4739759,comment,4734930,4737414,2,0,josephlord,,,"What Google did is an interesting example but at least jbri's comment referred to breaking functionality if you changed it at all so it needed to be copied.<p>Oracle did make the point that Google didn't copy enough for compatibility and Write Once Run Anywhere effectively forking their entire ecosystem/platform without a license.  It has killed Java on mobile (although maybe it would have happened anyway and maybe it is a good thing with Oracle running the show).  I think that if the participants in the case hadn't been the most hated and loved companies in tech many people might have had a different view of the case.<p>There are a number of other reasons for copying an API than compatibility.<p>1) Its an efficient (lazy?) way to get to a well designed API without you having to do multiple rounds of iterative design as users hammer on it over several years.<p>2) Existing documentation can be used.  [Documentation, tutorials StackOverflow answers].<p>3) Users are already familiar with it.<p>It seems to me that Google did a pretty vicious embrace, extend, extinguish on mobile Java and they may still be the better custodians of the platform but I'm not sure the behaviour is actually acceptable in general.  They took maximum benefit from Sun's efforts to create a platform and a community and give the absolute minimum back.  Just imagine if it was Microsoft (or even Apple) in the Google roll and old Sun (rather than Oracle) in the Oracle roll - would you still feel the same about the case?<p>Now does this mean I want to be locked into a provider unable to find an alternative implementer of a required library - absolutely not.  But that is a factor to consider when adopting a platform/library as a cost to be weighed against the benefits.  I always like an exit option or accept significant risk if I don't have one.  Obviously API developers could offer permissive licenses to the API even if the library itself is closed source as a way to reassure customers and gain business.  I'm not sure law is required OR desirable in this area.",1352036710

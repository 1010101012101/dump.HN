It can be funny for a story or two, but I do get tired of the negativity.<p>What might be cooler is always suggesting another way of doing things.  Maybe using the case study approach.  Here's what went wrong, and here's what we're going to do to fix it.  That'd be a cool site.\n",1175626199

I found myself filtering the links trying to spot new domains which would lead me to new things i haven't seen - kinda like how i got to emilys hub to just see what new 2.0s have popped up.   <p>It'd be interesting a tag cloud view or word frequency count, kinda like that other site i saw where you can read whats on peoples minds in twitter the past min, hour, day etc. <p>I like the idea of at a glance views of twitter data since it so fleeting.  \n",1175626153

8583,comment,8278,8278,0,0,shsung,,,"What an angry letter. They upped the quality of the music and charged a little more for it, there's nothing wrong with that. They charge what they think the market is willing to bear, not what it might be ""truly worth."" A Louis Vuitton bag costs a whole lot less to make than to sell, but prices will never go down, because that's what people are willing to pay. <p>If others join in to compete in the DRMless music wave, then at best we can hope it will drive the price down. That's competition at its best, an effort to capture the market by constantly producing something better OR cheaper (and not necessarily both). At the very least, you're getting something better.

I bet that if a big company acquired a company whose product was written in Python/Ruby/etc then they'd consider rewriting into C# or Java.  And they'd have the same issues that Yahoo and Sony had, as expressed in this article.<p>",1175624859

It all came down to three things:<p>1. We wanted to show potential employers that we were smart enough to get into an elite private college.<p>2. We wanted to show potential employers that we were docile and persistent enough to continue attending said elite private college, even though we had accomplished #1.<p>3. We wanted to get to know lots of other people who were willing to pay $40K/year for the privilege of #1 and #2.<p>Of course, once you get out in the working world and actually get involved in hiring decisions, you quickly learn that there's not <i>that much</i> difference in the quality of education at various universities.  Harvard's classroom instruction is not much better than any other top-tier college, and may actually be worse.  MIT's is probably better, but it's nothing that a couple of guys from UVA (ahem, Reddit) can't pick up in their spare time.<p>Instead, you look at the Education section on a resume because people have already done the hard work for you.  Someone at Harvard painstakingly went through 18 years of that candidate's life and decided that they were good enough for Harvard.  I've got code to write: I don't have time to spend digging through a candidate's background.  If it's good enough for Harvard, it's good enough for me.<p>So, the business idea I came up with was a simple certification program.  We'd look at all your test scores, administer a few additional tests, have you complete a project or two, talk to previous people you've worked with, and generally decide if you're worthy or not.  We'd set the bar high enough that the average Harvard or MIT grad would fail.  And if you pass, we give you a college degree - all without having to put up with the bullshit aspects, like going to classes or forking over a couple hundred dollars.  You're responsible for your own education, we just say whether you've educated yourself.<p>I wonder if I should've put this down under ""other ideas"" on my yCombinator app.",1175623551

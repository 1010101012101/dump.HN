Yes, it's great to have local collaborators but it's hardly necessary.  There are plenty of tools that allow collaborators to work together no matter where they are.<p>The most famous example I can think of is David Heinemeier Hansson.  He worked as a partner in Chicago based 37Signals  even though he lived in Denmark up until a few years ago.<p>The truth is, whether someone's in another part of your rural community or in Denmark the collaboration itself shouldn't be that different (using tools like Skype, IM and even 37Signals' set of collaborative tools)",1250495995

Maxwell's work was experimentally verified in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz, following a suggestion from George Francis Fitzgerald, discovered radio waves by directly applying Maxwell's formulas.<p><a href=""http://www.answers.com/topic/electricity-and-magnetism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answers.com/topic/electricity-and-magnetism</a><p>Can you imagine how much Hertz's mind was blown when the prediction turned out to be true?

Go way way simpler. Energy has weight. Speed things up, they are heavier. Want to speed it even more? You need to add even more energy than the first time because now you are also speeding up the energy [weight] from before.<p>Run the math. Solve. Final result c=speed_limit. The math is easy, don't take my word for it. Do you know any calculus? That's all you need for the math.<p>You are talking about advanced topics like gravitons and tachyons, without even understanding the simple topics like energy having weight [mass].<p>How do we know that the weight of energy is equal to the energy times c_squared?<p>You can measure it, that's how. The earliest particle accelerators can do it. Actually you don't even need a particle accelerator.<p>Take a gamma ray (a photon), cause it to split into an electron and an anti-electron (using a magnet). Measure the energy of the photon that is left over. The difference is the energy that was consumed in making the electron and anti-electron.<p>Measure the mass [weight] of a single electron.<p>Do math. Result: e=mc2 (i.e. mass of an electron * 2 * c_squared + energy of leftover photon = energy of starting photon).",1250495141

For the material it is used for (introductory calculus) and the way it is used, one of these TI calculators hurts student learning and understanding more than it helps, and there is no excuse for schools to force students to purchase a $100 piece of electronics without a damn good reason. That these devices are absurdly overpriced compared to the state of the art (~$100 multipurpose netbooks, for instance), and that the models required are made by a single company with monopolistic coordination with standardized tests and textbooks, only make things worse.<p>Learning how to use a calculator is perhaps a useful skill, but it's one that can be learned quickly if needed and should not be pervasively required: for most math done for math's sake (that is, as opposed to computations for some engineering problem), students would be better off if teachers instead made problems that could easily be worked with pen and paper.<p>(Personally, I made it through high school and then up through upper-level undergraduate mathematics, physics, econometrics, etc. courses without ever buying a graphing calculator, so it’s clearly not strictly mandatory for current curricula, but students and parents get the impression that it is essential, and the vast majority of students do buy them, so the effect is about the same.)",1250494582

",,"Good Morning HN,<p>This is my first HN submission and instead of submitting a Tech Crunch article, I am submitting a very perplexing question in which I seek a solution.<p>You see, I live in rural Eastern Canada (New Brunswick) in a town that has the population of ~6k people and I experience the difficulty of finding like-minded individuals to collaborate with on my projects and ideas. I know there are people in my area who have some similar interests as me (same as all of you, which I assume, is technology and entrepreneurship) but as there are no organisations to join where I could ultimately network with these individuals I seek, I cannot find them anywhere. You would think the internet would make this problem much easier to solve, it has not.<p>I have come up with some a tentative solution and a non-solution to my problem; I will start with the solution:<p>I have been thinking about organizing a start up weekend in my area. In the surrounding area there is a large satellite internet service provider and the data center for the worlds largest frozen foods manufacturer. Combine these two entities and I think I might be able to draw out enough people to cover the expenses of the event. However, in the event that I DO organize the event and not enough people show up, I would be left with covering the expenses of the event and that is something I cannot afford. (perhaps we could think of solutions to this problem?) I could perhaps sell tickets in which people must pay for the event in advance, but I don't think that would work..I could be wrong?<p>Non-solution:<p>Move. Simply put, even though it`s not as fast paced as Silicon Valley or any City for that matter, I love it here. I love being able to swim in nearby bodies of water without risk of..pollution, sickness and disease. I love the wilderness and the shooting at animals in the aforementioned wilderness. Moving is just something I don't want to do at this point and I will only endure this option when all else fails - I know I could move back, but I want to make a run at a start up in my area first.<p>So how do people in similar situations as me find other people to collaborate with on projects? I have many ideas, some larger than others, but they all don't seem as fun without having someone else to work on them with. Not to mention, they also seem like an insurmountable task to tackle on my lonesome.",1250494461

The only thing relating each camp to another is that they all at war with each other in a grand popularity contest.  The community that gets the most air time is in the lead.  There is no progress in philosophy, only novel ideas which supplantt the old due to the boredom inherent in parroting nonsense.",1250492770

The point is that all kinds of crazy methods might turn out to be effective, but we wouldn't therefore want to call them scientific.<p>Maybe I'm just using circular logic here, but the only way we know whether a method is effective is by testing it.  Nevertheless, I don't think there's a working scientist out there who wouldn't want to trust a colleague's intuition (that we've already established as reliable) to try to do things we don't quite rationally understand yet.  I think the key thing to remember is that ultimately, it has to be an <i>effective</i> means, and the way scientists figure out what is or isn't effective is by experiment.",1250492526

I'm a huge fan of Asimov's non-style literary style (clarity over all), and it works well in autobiography.  If you like scifi, at all, Asimov was an eye witness to nearly its entire history from golden age onward, and thus worth reading.  He's also perhaps one of the few truly credible witnesses to that history; a number of other genre favorites and stalwarts had psychological issues (Dick), personal feuds and vendettas (Ellison), an aversion to the community (Lem), or were just batshit crazy (Hubbard), and thus their accounts can't generally be taken without large grains of salt.",1250492411

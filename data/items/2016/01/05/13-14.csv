Maybe memory buffer errors happen to other programmers often enough that it&#x27;s worth worrying about for other people, but I&#x27;d argue this says more about those other programmers, and I propose that the techniques I use to avoid making those mistakes are more valuable than memory protection since it clearly allows me to have my cake and eat it too.<p>I&#x27;ve observed a great deal of performance can be gained by controlling how my structure is laid out in memory, but in order to do that, the compiler needs to trust me.<p>Maybe.<p>Some languages are experimenting with algebraic types and what they&#x27;re doing might be a good-enough middle ground such that they can actually get zero-cost buffer protection, but I haven&#x27;t played with them much to know for certain. I&#x27;m willing to be convinced, but I haven&#x27;t yet, so I continue to maintain that enforced memory protection is not ideal.<p>Re 2) I think the original point is that the implementation should be free to change it however (and whenever) they like. That&#x27;s why they wanted opaque strings, such that you access them from the interface itself.<p>Re 3) It depends. If it fails, then we&#x27;ve lost however long it takes to scan 300GB (a few minutes), but just because we copied it once from the disk, doesn&#x27;t mean we need to copy it again and again: That turns minutes into hours. I agree that most strings don&#x27;t need to be mutated, and that it&#x27;s reasonable to default to it, however order-of-magnitude performance gains are worth spending a little time thinking about, and they often require mutating-in-place.<p>Traversing a tree is another good example, and the Schorr-Deutsch-Waite link-inversion algorithm (Knuth, TAOCP vol.1 § 2.3.5) is essential for constrained-memory devices when you need a tree-walker. Sometimes I need to mutate, so I think <i>enforcing</i> immutability is simply not valuable.",1452002284

There is a social expectation that people should be honest, I think, and while we would not be surprised to hear of people getting ripped off on craigslist or ebay, and while we encourage others to take the possibility into consideration when making purchases, we (or at least I) nonetheless place the bulk of the blame for fraud on the malicious seller, not the hapless buyer.",1452002266

For example, it&#x27;s harder to avoid mixed content errors on HTTPS pages, you couldn&#x27;t just use the &quot;secure&quot; flag on all cookies and you need to be careful not to send passwords or session data over HTTP. Many sites have login forms on HTTP pages that then send you over to the HTTPS site for example but this isn&#x27;t secure.<p>Not saying it has no benefits, but mixing HTTP and HTTPS does have complications.<p>> I was chatting with a youtube engineer last night and she told me that she does not recall a wide discussion on disabling http fully, I thus submitted a request in youtube&#x27;s forum and see how it goes.<p>Great, I&#x27;d be interested to know the reason as well.",1452002166

Each JSON payload is a tree with three kinds of nodes. Lists, associative arrays and values (of few flexible types).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by set of objects because JSON doesn&#x27;t have set type. You can have something like set if you use an array but disregard order or use associative array but disregard types. Also the objects can contain objects. That&#x27;s what makes it actually a tree.<p>> But what do you use to work with XML(or HTML) as a tree? You use DOM, OO API. And DOM sucks.<p>Yes but you don&#x27;t have to. You could map XML (at least the subset commonly used with AJAX) directly to tree of plain old JavaScript objects (you&#x27;d need some conventions though because in xml you can invent various ways of representing lists and associative arrays).<p>> Namespaces and doctypes are not mandatory.<p>Probably just my personal experience but some implementations of xml interoperability didn&#x27;t allow me to specify default namespace for my xml tags which made me add bogus namespace identifier and prefix all my tags with that.<p>Namespaces are optional but that optionality is not stated clearly enough in the spec and some apis don&#x27;t allow you to forget about namespaces.<p>> Nothing was stopping you from using XML the way it used in React.<p>Just lack of good syntax/api.<p>> I&#x27;m not overthinking it, it&#x27;s not my idea in the first place.<p>I was referring to your argument (as I understood it) that there are some deep mismatches between JSON and XML akin to object relational impedance mismatch.\nIt&#x27;s not that JSON is objects and XML is data. Both are just trees of values.<p>My point is that the difference is just syntax but I&#x27;d like to backpedal from that now. JSON vs XML is not just syntax and lack of XML oddities. It&#x27;s also a good deal of &quot;less is more&quot;. Now I think JSON is XML but with one obvious way to express sequence and one obvious way to label the data for access.<p>Anyways.

But I think it was Mandrake that I originally ran as my desktop - way back at the turn of the century (albeit not as my primary desktop)<p>My Linux experience hasn&#x27;t been without it&#x27;s problems. But I really hated the direction Microsoft took with XP and, back then, I couldn&#x27;t afford a Mac. So Linux was more a case of &quot;the lesser of 3 evils&quot; - particularly since my previous favourite OS, BeOS, was pretty much dead by that point. But over the years I&#x27;ve come to appreciate and depend on the POSIX / Linux paradigm so much that I feel completely handicapped when presented with a Windows desktop.<p>Which brings me to the crux of the issues with any Windows desktop vs Linux desktop debates: the two paradigms are vastly different yet many of the &quot;Linux isn&#x27;t ready for the desktop&quot; conclusions are derived from authors approaching Linux like a Windows clone and then wondering why things don&#x27;t behave like they&#x27;d expect.",1451999302

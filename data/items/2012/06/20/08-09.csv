For instance, here in Italy, I don't think that highly of the legal system, so there is a bit more incentive for <i>some</i> people to take the risk and go abroad like this.

But finally, once someone gullible enough follows up - if you have a nigerian accent or ask them to mail to a nigerian account, claiming to be from some other place will make maintaining that credibility very difficult.

4136141,comment,4132592,4132592,2,0,its_so_on,,,"Hey, I actually can <i>kind</i> of see where this premise is coming from.  Not completely.  But let's see how it kind of philosophically does make a tiny bit of sense. It does violate my privacy (even more) if someone tells me they've been spying on me.<p>To see this, consider: after someone spies on you, what's the least damage they can do to your privacy?  Obviously the most is to publish everything they have on you for everyone.  But what's the least?<p>The least damage is to completely forget it, never mention it, never think about it, and not even acknowledge or record it - let the world be exactly the same as if they had not spied on me.<p>I'm not saying this is better than ACTUALLY not ever spying on me, but it's the best thing for my privacy once they have.<p>Say you're a security person and do bag searches, a celebrity comes through and you actually see something very embarrassing in their bag, on some subject there's been public speculation on.  (Their sexuality, whether they have some disease and you see meds for it, whatever).    What's the best way to protect their privacy after you clear them (nothing dangerous in the bag)?<p>Obviously, by not even mentioning/acknowledging that you searched them, just by moving on.<p>If all my email (along with everyone else's) is being scanned to see if I'm concocting a terrorist plot, then the best you can do <i>after</i> this fact is not even ackowledge this and in every way act and produce a world as though it never happened.<p>Note that this does not make the original invasion of privacy any better.  It doesn't condone it.  It may also make it harder to instate more appropriate privacy policies in the future.  But the premise ""If I answered you 'every single person on US territory who has sent an email or made or received a telephone call in the past 36 months' then it would violate your privacy"" is not completely devoid of any merit.  Should every single person's privacy have been violated?  No.  We have constitutional protections against that sort of thing.<p>If it has, would it violate their privacy further to go boasting about this fact?  What if it means that anyone suing you for anything can use this knowledge to do discovery and request your communications from the government?  In this and a myriad other scenarios, telling the extent to which you invaded people's privacy can be worse for their privacy than refusing to do so.<p>Not saying I'm convinced.  I'm just saying there's a little something in this line of thought.  Obviously the late Martin Luther King's privacy is far worse off now than if we never knew that the FBI kept detailed files on him...",1340182137

4136139,comment,4134426,4134426,3,0,haxe,,,"Wow ... this guy is just an arrogant idiot ...<p>You first need to understand that opengl specification are not made to be easy to use, but efficient. And the api design is highly constraint by the hardware. You also need to understand that opengl 1.3 is FCKING 11 YEARS OLD !<p>Back in the day you had immediate mode. You first call glBegin, then make one call to glVertex for each vertex and finally call glEnd. So if you want to render one frame of a cube, that's 1+6*4+1=26 calls, and for each call your cpu send data to the graphic card.\nThere are two huge problems with that : you need to the transfer the same vertex data to the graphic card for each frame and your cpu processing power limit your graphic card processing power (because cpu calls take way more time than your graphic card takes to render a vertex).<p>Why was it designed like that in the first place if it's inefficient ? Easy : there were no graphic card. All the 3D rendering was done by the cpu.<p>So with the development of more powerful graphic card, they updated the specification. With the new api you allocate memory buffers of vertex directly on your graphic card memory and you just need to call one function to render the whole buffer. So you don't need to transfer all the vertex data at each frame, and you don't need to do gazillion of function calls to render a cube.\nTHIS WAS IN 2004 !<p>So when the khronos consortium (just a reminder, the ""idiots"" are : Apple, AMD/ATI, Nvidia, Intel, Google, Id Software, ...) decided in 2007 to make a mobile version (ES stand for embedded system) of opengl, did they choose to base their api on something conceived in 1992 and dropped in 2004 ?\nOF COURSE NOT !<p>But why not keep it compatible ? Well it's a waste of time. Developers shouldn't use deprecated functionality since 2004 in 2012, especially when it's highly inefficient.<p>This guy need to grow up, understand that opengl ES main objective is not screensavers, understand that he sometimes need to update a little bit his programming knowledge and acknowledge that he's not an expert in the very complex field of gpu.<p>tldr; he's the idiot",1340182113

Its strategic posture is primarily defensive, so accordingly its nuclear strategy is also defensive. This is why Israel's neighbours are not massively concerned about its nuclear stockpile.<p>Iran's government and military on the other hand have openly stated the country's regional hegemonic strategic ambitions. It wishes to weaken the Sunni Arab balance of power (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, etc) that has held sway over the region for the past few decades. Hence it should be regarded as a state which wishes to project power over its neighbours and become the primary influence in the region.<p>That difference in strategic outlook makes all the difference in the world, because it means that Iran is likely to use its nuclear capability as a protective umbrella under which it can undermine the Middle East's most powerful countries without fear of retaliation.<p>This is why the Wikileaks memos showed that most strong Arab powers were secretly in support of American or Israeli action against Iran. An unbalanced Middle East and an Iran free to use its proxies such as Hezbollah against whoever it chooses represent grave strategic threats to every established power in the Middle East. Any additional chaos in turn is dangerous for Israel, as are an unleashed Hezbollah and Hamas.<p>That's why it makes perfect sense for Israel to oppose Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons despite having an arsenal of its own and why other countries, including most of the EU, are more concerned about Iran building nuclear weapons than they are about Israel already having them.",1340180607

Can't find the source on this, but I read somewhere that the newest Chinese solar panels are clearly economically viable even without subsidies.<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-17/u-s-solar-tariffs-on-chinese-cells-may-boost-prices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-17/u-s-solar-tariffs-o...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18112983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18112983</a>",1340179436

The question is more where those taxes go: wall street bailouts, wars in foreign countries, unaffordable pension systems, and how much is available, which clearly isn’t enough based upon the ever increasing national debt.  It doesn’t seem to be ‘idiots’ vs. everyone, but more likely generation vs. generation.   And having spent over a decade in the military with multiple deployments I can relate to idea of ‘free riders’ not ‘paying the price’, but again regarding taxes, I think most people are likely willing to contribute their share when it’s a fair amount and used responsibly.  Determining what’s fair and how to use it is the challenge.",1448128758

All we&#x27;ve found to date is a bunch of configuration bits and maybe a general idea of how things <i>might</i> be related to each other but not much more than that.<p>The gap in understanding between &#x27;here are a bunch of bits that appear to do &#x27;x&#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;x&#x27; is vast, far larger than the gap between say being able to build a compiler to have an executable perform in a certain way.<p>If anywhere <i>that</i> is where the real breakthrough will be, in being able to effectively map the chain of binary bits in a genome to a certain phenotype in a mature organism without any &#x27;leftover bits&#x27;.<p>Once you have that chain of causality mapped out in enough detail to clearly link all causes with their effects you can start engineering something to act in a way that is far outside what we normally find in nature.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m expressing myself clearly about all this, maybe someone more versed in the matter can chime in but the path between DNA and organism is a lot longer and less well understood than the path between a low level language program and the resulting output of that program. Just having a &#x27;compiler&#x27; will not change much about that understanding, though once we have that compiler we may be able to advance our understanding by a more direct approach in modifying pieces of an existing genome to observe the effects in the organism. For sure it will speed things up.<p>edit: if we <i>did</i> have that understanding it would be trivial to create a digital representation of a (simple) organism from it&#x27;s sequenced DNA. The fact that we are nowhere near capable of doing this is a simple proof that merely being able to create a certain sequence of bits will not give us the capability to create organisms to order.",1448128749

10607407,comment,10601326,10601326,0,0,oneJob,,,"All that &quot;non-profit&quot; means is, from Wikipedia, :<p>&quot;A non-profit organization is an organization that uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization&#x27;s shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends.&quot;<p>There are plenty of ways to raise capital that allow an organization to abide by such restrictions. A nonprofit is not strictly restricted on who it can hire or what products it can make or services it can offer. So, unless your definition of &quot;successful&quot; requires that you distribute surplus revenues to shareholders, then yes, it is possible to start a successful tech non-profit.<p>You can pay your employees massive salaries. You can raise massive amounts of debt to fund your expansion. You can employ ruthless business practices.<p>Many businesses do not distribute capital to shareholders until well after the business has matured, reasoning that the capital is better used growing the business. Meaning, the investors have a long investment horizon. Meaning, their initial smaller amount, often accompanied by additional rounds of funding, was enough to get a successful business going. Capital sources can include endowments, public and private grants, or payment for goods and services.<p>Personally, I believe that non-profits have gotten a bad wrap. There are some amazing companies out there that do not aim to return money to shareholders, that prioritize their product, their cause, or their customers. I&#x27;d highly, highly recommend checking out YouTube videos about Patagonia and it&#x27;s founder, along these lines. You can even mis-use non-profit status. Many people don&#x27;t realize that IKEA is a non-profit, and that the profits are extracted from its activities through some tax and legal loopholes.<p>Typically, the relevant issues are related to the raising of capital. But think about how that often turns out. Many founders raising outside capital lose control of their company or see their share diluted, that is if the company is even successful. And if it is, and they maintain control and their share of ownership, it could be a long time before there is any surplus revenue.<p>On the flip side, you can start a private company and be help accountable to no one but yourself. You can raise all different sorts of capital. And you can determine what social / environmental impact you make. You pretty much only lose the tax breaks.<p>So you see, it&#x27;s really a matter of capital management, not of business management. You can reduce your options for raising capital from the get go, or you can choose to deal with taxes and possibly even make those go away, like GE magically does. But there are no impediments to you delivering a product or service to make the sort of impact you are hoping to make.",1448127847

Yes, a pretty framework with bad code is still a bad framework. Yet, when comparing AngularJS&#x27;s website with competitors like React or Ember or even Backbone, it seems their  developers care more for making their software look good.

Yet, interestingly, the documentation was not updated for several months after the comments removal. This means that, for several months, all the fixes, suggestions, and the like were no longer viewable for the current version of AngularJS. The solution put forward by the developers for this long interim was to... use Stackoverflow.<p>Needless to say, Angular users were less than enthused. That the devs didn&#x27;t seem to engage with the community before or after regarding the sudden change, made me question a number of things about the project.",1448126467

The title of the 2006 paper that introduced them is &quot;Message authentication on 64-bit architectures&quot;. Google scholar says it has been cited 32 times, while &quot;SipHash: a fast short-input PRF&quot; has been cited 43 times.<p>> As far as I know, the state of the art for &quot;fast and secure&quot; is still SipHash 2-4 or 2-3.<p>SipHash seems to me like a good choice.<p>SipHash has some security properties that Vhash does not, although Vhash-based-VMAC has similar security properties to SipHash, I believe. However, for hash flooding attacks, if the hash values themselves are not directly exposed to the attackers and there is enough noise in the response latency that timing attacks are difficult, I do not know what benefits SipHash has.<p>&quot;Faster 64-bit universal hashing using carry-less multiplications&quot; has some benchmarks that show Vhash as faster than SipHash, substantially so on long input.<p>Speed-wise, an iterated string hash using Dietzfelbinger-style multiply-shift hashing is also substantially faster (3-10x) than SipHash on both large and small inputs in my testing, and it needs about 20 lines of code to implement.

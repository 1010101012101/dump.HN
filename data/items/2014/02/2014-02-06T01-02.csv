It&#x27;s a philosophy which didn&#x27;t entirely survive his departure from the company as you may recall Intel reached a settlement with the DoJ over anticompetitive monopolistic practices (though in fairness:  the company did settle and fairly quickly).<p>The conspiracy and means Gates proposed, along with many, many other actions of Microsoft, did in fact constitute illegal monopolization, as Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson&#x27;s findings of fact established:  <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm</a><p>As George Hoar, one of the authors of the Sherman Antitrust Act stated:  &quot;... [a person] who merely by superior skill and intelligence...got the whole business because nobody could do it as well as he could was not a monopolist..(but was if) it involved something like the use of means which made it impossible for other persons to engage in fair competition.&quot;<p>And in particular, the statute itself states:  &quot;Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.&quot;<p>So, while your hypothetical has certain merits, in the particulars of this situation, it rather markedly fails to apply, as established by both the relevant statute and legal findings.",1391651863

7188246,comment,7186977,7187984,10,0,patio11,,,"I hesitate to mention this, since I don&#x27;t want to recommend trading it, but for academic interest: you can create &quot;synthetic&quot; short positions using options.<p>The mechanics: Say hypothetically Twitter is trading at around $65.  You post $1300 of collateral with your broker (cash or stock).  You then sell 1 contract (100 shares worth) of Twitter calls with a $65 strike for the prevailing price (about $3.80 when I did it, or $380 for the contract) then use the proceeds of that to buy 1 contract worth of puts with the same $65 strike.  When you factor in the spread, skew (slight difference in put/call pricing despite that they&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be symmetric), and commissions, it likely costs about $100 to $200 total to enter this trade.  Then you wait until earnings.<p>You would have, in the instant case, made out like a bandit.  When the market opens tomorrow morning, your puts will <i>likely</i> be worth approximately $15, your short calls about -$1.  You&#x27;d presumably choose to exit the trade rather than taking risk to ride it to expiration, so you&#x27;d sell the puts, buy calls to cover your short, and (after again paying the spread/commission) be up $1,300 for your trouble.<p>You can work out the math to prove this position is roughly -100 delta in Twitter: if the price of Twitter declines by $1, the position gains $100 in value, if it increases by $1, the position loses $100 in value.  Neither side is capped.  (Well, OK, the gain has a theoretical maximum if Twitter goes to zero before expiration but that&#x27;s highly unlikely.)  This is equivalent to shorting 100 shares.<p>Why isn&#x27;t that totally free money?  Well, if Twitter were currently $80, you&#x27;d be looking at paying +/- $1,500 to exit the trade.  You also might find that happens at the worst possible time, due to a potential margin call on your short position.  The market is a humility generation engine for people who think they&#x27;re consistently smarter than it.",1391651828

7188214,comment,7185432,7187344,1,0,shykes,,,"Our priority in the short term is definitely to focus on the Linux ABI and making it available on as many physical machines as possible. This is the reasoning behind our current OSX support, and support for more platforms coming soon.<p>Longer term we do need to support multiple ABIs, if only because a lot of people want to use Docker on x86-32 and ARM. Having ELF binaries built on Linux isn&#x27;t of much help if they&#x27;re built for another arch :) So at the very least we will need to support 3 ABIs in the near future.<p>The good news is that it can be done in a way which doesn&#x27;t hurt the repeatability of Docker&#x27;s execution environment. Think of it this way: every container has certain requirements to run. At the very least it needs a certain range of kernels and archs (and yes it&#x27;s possible, although uncommon for a binary to support multiple archs). It may also require a network interface to bind a socket on a certain TCP port. It may require certain syscalls to be authorized. It may require the ability to create a tun/tap device. And so on.<p>Docker&#x27;s job is to offer a portable abstraction for these requirements, so that the container can list what it needs on the one hand, the host can list what it offers on the other, and docker can match them in the middle. If the requirements listed by a given container aren&#x27;t met (&quot;I need CAP_SYSADMIN on a 3.8 linux kernel and an ARM processor!&quot;) then docker returns an error and a clear error message. If they <i>are</i> met, the container is executed and <i>must always be repeatable</i>.<p>TLDR: ABI requirements are just one kind of requirements. Docker can handle multiple requirements without breaking the repeatability of its execution environment.",1391651278

The plan is to explain the details of Algorithmia more in future posts, but here&#x27;s the basic idea:<p>We want smarter machines, and that means making algorithms more widely available. To achieve that, we&#x27;re creating a community around algorithm development, where people can contribute code and collaborate with others on that code. Github has done a great job of this, but it is not always trivial to get from a github repo to live code in production. We think that creating a built-in market for algorithms-as-a-service could be a way to reward algorithm developers for their work, and make algorithms easily accessible via REST API.<p>The types of algorithms we are talking about is not limited by us.

Furthermore, it&#x27;s not like there are only some edge cases to work out.<p>There are also substantive objections to the content of what is being shipped. Not only on the names (which Google invited comment on) but also on the intended semantics. It&#x27;s pretty hard to usefully comment on the semantics without a draft spec and some time for discussion.<p>That&#x27;s why most browser vendors try to make sure there is at least a draft, time for discussion, and rough consensus before shipping a feature enabled and unprefixed.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Apple WebKit engineers agree with many Google Blink engineers about lots of standards topics, we actively collaborate on many things, and we actively support the goals of Web Components and of this particular styling feature, if not necessarily all the details.

Spec was full of race conditions from day 1 and some of them still aren&#x27;t fixed.)<p>* Poorly-tested<p>* Large, obvious functionality gaps (you can&#x27;t pause playback of sounds! you can&#x27;t stitch buffers together! you can&#x27;t do playback of synthesized audio at rates other than the context rate!)<p>* Incompatible with existing <audio>-based code (thanks to inventing a new, inferior way for loading audio assets), making all your audio code instantly browser-specific<p>* Large enough in scope to be difficult to implement from scratch, even given a good specification (which was lacking)<p>* A set of shiny, interesting DSP/filter chain features, like convolution and delay and HRTF panning and so on, useful for specific applications<p>* Basic support for playback and mixing roughly on par with that previously offered by <audio>, minus some feature gaps<p>The merits for the old Mozilla audio data API at the time of Web Audio&#x27;s release:<p>* Extends the <audio> element&#x27;s API to add support for a couple specific features that solve an actual problem<p>* Narrow scope means that existing audio code remains cross-browser compatible as long as it does not use this specific API<p>* The specific features are simple enough to trivially implement in other browsers<p>You keep making insane leaps like &#x27;Web Audio is good because it&#x27;s like Core Audio&#x27; and &#x27;Mozilla wants you to write DSPs in JavaScript because ... ????&#x27; even though there&#x27;s no coherent logic behind them and there&#x27;s no evidence to actually support these things. A way to synthesize audio in JavaScript does not prevent the introduction of an API for hardware DSP mixing or whatever random oddball feature you want; quite the opposite: it allows you to introduce those new APIs while offering cross-browser compatible polyfills based on the older API. The web platform has been built on incremental improvement and graceful degradation.<p>P.S. Even if the Web Audio API were not complete horseshit at the point of its introduction, when it was introduced the Chrome team had sat on their asses for multiple versions, shipping a <i>completely</i> broken implementation of <audio> in their browser while other vendors (even Microsoft!) had support that worked well enough for playing sound effects in games. It&#x27;s no coincidence that web developers were FORCED to adopt Google&#x27;s new proprietary API when the only alternative was games that crashed tabs and barely made sound at all.",1391650180
7188130,comment,7185432,7187649,12,0,shykes,,,"> <i>Unfortunately Docker prevents hosting environments from employing some of the most potent security mitigations added to Linux recently.</i><p>You list various facts that are mostly correct, but your conclusion is wrong. Docker absolutely <i>does not</i> reduce the range of security mitigations available to you.<p>Your mistake is to present docker as an alternative to those security mitigations. It&#x27;s not an alternative - it presents you with a sane default which can get you pretty far (definitely further than you are implying). When the default does not fit your needs, you can fit Docker in a security apparatus that does.<p>The current default used by docker is basically pivot_root + namespaces + cgroups + capdrop, via the lxc scripts and a sane locked down configuration. Combined with a few extra measures like, say, apparmor confinement, dropping privileges inside the container with `docker run -u`, and healthy monitoring, you get an environment that is production-worthy for a large class of payloads out there. It&#x27;s basically how Dotcloud, Heroku and almost every public &quot;paas&quot; service out there works. It&#x27;s definitely not a good environment for <i>all</i> payloads - but like I said, it is definitely more robust than you imply.<p>So your first mistake is to dismiss the fact that linux containers are in fact an acceptable sandboxing mechanism for many payloads out there.<p>Your second mistake is to assume that if your payloads need something other than linux containers, you can&#x27;t use Docker. Specifically:<p>> <i>You cannot treat a docker container like a virtual machine – code running in the container has almost unfettered access to the parent kernel, and the millions of lines of often-buggy C that involves. For example with the right kernel configuration, this approach leaves the parent machine vulnerable to the recent x86_32 vulnerability (<a href=""http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/187</a>) and many similar bugs in its class.</i><p>> <i>The containers code in Linux is also so new that trivial security bugs are being found in it all the time – particularly in sysfs and procfs. I don&#x27;t have a link right now, though LWN wrote about one a few weeks back.</i><p>> <i>While virtual machines are no security panacea, they diverge in what classes of bugs they can be affected by. Recent Qemu/libvirt supports running under seccomp.. ensuring even if the VM emulator is compromised, the host kernel&#x27;s exposure remains drastically limited. Unlike qemu, you simply can&#x27;t apply seccomp to a container without massively reducing its usefulness, or using a seccomp policy so liberal that it becomes impotent.</i><p>Of course you&#x27;re right, sometimes a container is not enough for sandboxing and you need a VM. Sometimes even a VM is not enough and you need physical machines. That&#x27;s fine. Just install docker on all of the above, and map containers to the underlying machines in a way that is consistent with your security policy. Problem solved.<p>> <i>You could use seccomp with Docker by nesting it within a VM, but at that point Docker loses most of its value (and could be trivially replaced by a shell script with a cute UI).</i><p>That&#x27;s your judgement to make, but I&#x27;m going to go a whim and say that you haven&#x27;t actually used Docker that much :) Docker is commonly used in combination of VMs for security, so at least <i>some</i> people find it useful.<p>> Finally when a bug is discovered and needs to be patched, or a machine needs to be taken out of service, there is presently no easy way to live-migrate a container to another machine. The most recent attempt (out of I think 3 or 4 now) to add this ability to Linux appears to have stalled completely.<p>In my opinion live migration is a nice to have. Sure, for some payloads it is critically needed, and no doubt the day linux containers support full migration those payloads will become more portable. But in practice a very large number of payloads don&#x27;t need it, because they have built-in redundancy and failover at the service level. So an individual node can be brought down for maintenance without affecting the service as a whole. Live migration also has other issues, for example it doesn&#x27;t work well beyond the boundaries of your shared storage infrastructure. Good luck implementing live migration across multiple geographical regions! This has been established as ops best practices , so over time the number of payloads which depend on live migration will diminish.<p>> <i>As a neat system for managing dev environments locally, it sounds great. As a boundary between mutually untrusted pieces of code, there are far better solutions, especially when the material difference in approaches amounts to a few seconds of your life at best, and somewhere south of 100mb in RAM.</i><p>To summarize: docker is primarily a system for managing and distributing repeatable execution environments, <i>from development to production</i> (and not just for development as you imply). It does not implement any security features by itself, but allows you to use your preferred isolation method (namespaes, hypervisor or good old physical separation) without losing the benefits of repeatable execution environments and a unified management API.",1391650170

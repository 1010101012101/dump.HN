9299448,comment,9297946,9298560,0,0,mrxd,,,"> So just because the author of this piece can deal with trauma doesn&#x27;t mean that all people could deal with trauma the same way.<p>There are standard treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, and all of them are focused on strengthening the individual&#x27;s ability to cope with symptoms. Altering their environment to avoid the occurrence of symptoms is not a valid treatment. In fact, its considered a symptom of PTSD (and several other mental health issues) which has its own specific treatment called exposure therapy. This treatment exposes the patient to what triggers anxiety and stress in a controlled fashion.<p>You, and many trauma activists, take a different view of the mental health profession on the nature and treatment of trauma that seems to reflect political and social goals of the movement rather than the well-being of the victims. As much as I agree with those goals, I have ethical problems with exploiting victims of trauma for political ends.",1427831981

Technology. Vonnegut was asked to discuss his feelings about living in an increasingly computerized world.<p>>> I work at home, and if I wanted to, I could have a computer right by my bed, and I&#x27;d never have to leave it. But I use a typewriter, and afterward I mark up the pages with a pencil. Then I call up this woman named Carol out in Woodstock and say, “Are you still doing typing?” Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat back and forth, and I say, “Okay, I&#x27;ll send you the pages.” Then I go down the steps and my wife calls, “Where are you going?” “Well,” I say, “I&#x27;m going to buy an envelope.” And she says, “You&#x27;re not a poor man. Why don&#x27;t you buy a thousand envelopes? They&#x27;ll deliver them, and you can put them in the closet.” And I say, “Hush.” So I go to this newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and lottery tickets and stationery. I have to get in line because there are people buying candy and all that sort of thing, and I talk to them. The woman behind the counter has a jewel between her eyes, and when it&#x27;s my turn, I ask her if there have been any big winners lately. I get my envelope and seal it up and go to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of Forty-seventh Street and Second Avenue, where I&#x27;m secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and got to meet a cop and tell him about it. Anyway, I address the envelope to Carol in Woodstock. I stamp the envelope and mail it in a mailbox in front of the post office, and I go home. And I&#x27;ve had a hell of a good time. I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you any different.<p>A bit of a reminder that we don&#x27;t have to be overly efficient about everything we do. Instead we can simply stay mindful and just enjoy whatever it is we are doing, even if it is waiting in line to buy an envelope, or waiting for the coffee to brew.",1427831194

Just because someone has made 80 sales calls a day in a prior job doesn&#x27;t mean they can demo and close. Make sure candidates have the expertise you need.<p>These two points contradict each other, and I think it is a very important issue. If you are not willing to allow a junior person a better opportunity immediately (hiring them into a promotion) then you have to compensate them better compared to the current company for the same position (short of intangibles.)<p>Often times, larger companies will have a more deliberate and organized sales process that is time-based. This creates scenarios where candidates that are otherwise qualified for the next step (Market Development Rep --> Account Executive) have a seemingly artificial ceiling preventing them from that role at their current company. While it probably makes sense at the larger company for a Market Rep to be promoted after 18-24 months, this person may be very capable of the next level earlier.<p>If you can successfully find driven junior level people who have this type of artificial ceiling, you can hire very valuable sales people. This also means you are going to have to take a risk that they can perform on the next level, but you can also hedge this risk by offering slightly less total compensation for the opportunity _now_.",1427830756

But on a number only input field I type 456A<del>7 and because the form wasn&#x27;t letting me type letters I get just 457 instead of 4567. Now I have to correct yet another mistake that was forced on me<p>Problem #2: Delete almost never works correctly. There&#x27;s a CC form [xxxx][xxxx][xxxx][xxxx]. I type want to type 123456789... I type 1235<del>4. I now have [1235][4...] instead of [1234][....]<p>Problem #4: Paste almost never works. I have my info somewhere. I copy 123456789... I paste I get [1234][....][....][....]  or I copy 1234-5678-9... and paste and I get an error. &quot;No dashes allowed&quot; or I get some other crap.<p>Problem #5: Copy rarely works because I can&#x27;t select all fields since they&#x27;ve been separated.<p>Problem #6: 95%-99% of the time tab goes to the next place in the form but many custom forms move to the next field automatically so I type a phone number 111-222-3333 and then press tab but because the custom form assumed the moment I typed the last 3 that it would be helpful to automatically go the next field I&#x27;m now two fields ahead.<p>You could possibly fix #2, #4 and #5 but I&#x27;d prefer just a blank field, no mucking with the input system. If you want to display some live status while I&#x27;m typing just outside the form on whether my input is correct or not yet that&#x27;s fine but please don&#x27;t mess up my typing muscle memory.<p>I&#x27;d be really curious if anyone has done any serious testing on these fancy custom input &quot;helpful&quot; forms vs simpler plain text areas.<p>Yet another is how about just accepting the user&#x27;s input and checking if it could be what you need. For example when taking a CC card, let me type WWWWXXXXYYYYZZZZ or WWWW XXXX YYYY ZZZZ or WWWW.XXXX.YYYY.ZZZZ or WWWW-XXX-YYYY-ZZZZ or even WWWW  XXXX    YYYY   ZZZZ. Check if you can turn that into 16 digits. If so assume it&#x27;s correct. Don&#x27;t force me to do it what&#x27;s easy for the computer. I might have it in some other format and I want to copy and paste it. Or I might just find it easier to space out because I can then read it and more easily check for mistakes. For example accept a US phone number in XXX-YYY-ZZZZ instead of forcing me to XXXYYYZZZZ",1427830454

9299249,comment,9298126,9298126,0,0,616c,,,"For a fun anecdote, I once heard a very cool Red Hat employee talk at the LUG in Washington, DC.<p>This was years ago, when Iraq was even worse than now (ironically &quot;the first second time&quot; I would call it).  He said there were a handful of techs, ironically maybe reservists stateside who were sysadmins, who became very high demand individuals.  They would, for instance, go to a base with very poor network connectivity, and would set point-to-point wifi systems so duty soldiers could communicate with each other on the far ends of the base about shifts and operational intel.  The other story he had was they used Red Hat or Fedora, I forget which to make a homebrew PVR system for a base on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border because this inspection station had a FLIR thermal imaging system, and thousands of trucks were coming through this point.  Two soldiers on shifts would sit all day and watch footage, making sure all of them were free of what might be contraban or explosives.  Prior to these Linux rockstars, these dudes would hold the whole line of trucks to take a leak, answer the phone, anything that involved taking their eyes off screen.  After they set up a PVR using a Linux box, they could pause, and the line could keep going, as the base was miles wide in the middle and the flow of traffic meant with a PVR they could flag it on exit with more than enough time with bathroom breaks and everything thanks to this.  This RedHat guy gave these and other examples, IIRC, and said they were being flown in C130s a few times because their solutions, as simple COTS ideas, always worked and cost almost nothing.<p>God, do I want to meet want of these dudes.  They are perhaps, despite the layer of filth their services&#x27; collective activities abroad have done to tarnish their rep as org and reps of the US, the only dudes in the military I respect, the FOSS Special Forces.<p>Now that is a TV series, no matter how bad, I would watch.<p>EDIT: I wanna say, after some difficult archive searching, the Red Hat guy was Greg Dekoenigsberg.

These people know they are good at what they do and will demand a higher salary, more benefits and bigger percentage of the company. They also know how to negotiate.

Right now startup valuations are high because, just like free agent sports stars, you only need one person to cut you a check for the valuation you want. Meaning, even if everyone else thinks you are extremely over priced you still get the valuation/money due to the one rogue investor/owner. This has the effect of pushing valuation only upward.<p>Imagine an ETF that pools shares in pre ipo stocks.  Now you can take the positions that the unicorns are over priced and short them.

Vonnegut was asked to discuss his feelings about living in an increasingly computerized world.<p>>> I work at home, and if I wanted to, I could have a computer right by my bed, and I&#x27;d never have to leave it. But I use a typewriter, and afterward I mark up the pages with a pencil. Then I call up this woman named Carol out in Woodstock and say, “Are you still doing typing?” Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat back and forth, and I say, “Okay, I&#x27;ll send you the pages.” Then I go down the steps and my wife calls, “Where are you going?” “Well,” I say, “I&#x27;m going to buy an envelope.” And she says, “You&#x27;re not a poor man. Why don&#x27;t you buy a thousand envelopes? They&#x27;ll deliver them, and you can put them in the closet.” And I say, “Hush.” So I go to this newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and lottery tickets and stationery. I have to get in line because there are people buying candy and all that sort of thing, and I talk to them. The woman behind the counter has a jewel between her eyes, and when it&#x27;s my turn, I ask her if there have been any big winners lately. I get my envelope and seal it up and go to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of Forty-seventh Street and Second Avenue, where I&#x27;m secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and got to meet a cop and tell him about it. Anyway, I address the envelope to Carol in Woodstock. I stamp the envelope and mail it in a mailbox in front of the post office, and I go home. And I&#x27;ve had a hell of a good time.

Chromebook may find a market in India or Africa or China. Places where a mobile device was everybody&#x27;s first experience with personal computing, so the idea of it being intimately tied to the network isn&#x27;t so strange. And, just as importantly, where $50 is a weeks wages so it seems a lot more important to spend 25% less on the device.<p>I can see how me invoking Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma here is possibly a stretch from some perspectives. Even if it is <i>not</i> disruptive innovation in the sense you prefer, it is still seeming more and more likely to continue to erode Microsoft&#x27;s dominance in the places they have always been very, very strong: Cheap home PCs.<p>Also, I think the argument could be made that this is a better product for less money. Windows on such scanty hardware is a pretty rough experience. Chrome OS on tiny machines isn&#x27;t so bad. And, for people who already only use their computer for Internet stuff, there are no benefits to the Windows experience and plenty of negatives.<p>So, this isn&#x27;t a situation of, &quot;Why would I get a dinky little fake computer if it&#x27;s only $50 less than a good computer with Windows?&quot; It&#x27;s more of a &quot;Why would I spend more for a computer that is slow, clunky, has a bunch of crap I don&#x27;t need/want only so I can use also-ran webmail, online docs, etc. when I can get the market leading stuff for less?&quot;<p>I dunno, really. I&#x27;m just trying to imagine this from the perspective of someone who didn&#x27;t grow up in a world dominated by Microsoft, because that&#x27;s the world we now live in. The world is now dominated by Google with Apple and Facebook as thought leaders on the periphery.

A counterargument is that you&#x27;re inherently taking advantage of the processor(s) and the operating system, not to mention, ha ha, every single component and factor that you did not personally create, whether or not it is computational in nature...<p>Another route, my present hobby and something that I know many have done before: Take the Lisp program on page 10 of the Lisp 1.5 User Manual and translate it into C. Write a simple tokenizer/parser (read function) in C and translate that into Lisp. Once the C program can run the equivalent Lisp program, we&#x27;re on our way.<p>At the outset I have no garbage collection. I just expect the memory space to fill up pretty soon. I could have `cons` compute a hash for each cell to eliminate common subexpressions, but for a while I suppose I won&#x27;t bother at all. The C program has a loop to handle evcon (did I write cons? oops), eval, and apply as a trio of mutually tail-recursive operations. That&#x27;s an obvious place to put a stop-the-world mark-and-sweep operation or some such thing.<p>To get the C tools out of the loop eventually, hand-disassemble the binary program (C compiler output) just to see what&#x27;s there.

Or at least, don&#x27;t write pure javascript implementations, call down to a C or Fortran implementation - which as I said, are hard enough to tune.<p>If you do want to write javascript however, why not write something more application based, why does it need to be raw linear algebra? Like an image processing library, or a linear-transforms-for-svg library[0]? Why do you need the raw linear algebra primitives, such as being able to map across elements?<p>Your snark towards my criticism is also absolutely ridiculous - no offense to the author, I think this is quite cool, but it is in no way &quot;forward thinking&quot;. I could link to tens of other javascript linear algebra libraries, so why is this one the best? And more importantly - why should it be shielded from criticism?<p>[0] I will admit, there is something similar to this, based off this library: <a href=""https://github.com/mateogianolio/vectorious-plot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mateogianolio/vectorious-plot</a> which slightly  detracts from my argument, but also bolsters it - as it proves that this library is only really useful with an application library wrapped around it.",1427828446

To add one important detail: the HP Stream you linked doesn&#x27;t just exist as a proof of concept or whatever, which would be one thing, but it&#x27;s currently outselling all the Chromebooks (and every other laptop for that matter) on Amazon.<p>Chromebooks dominated in 2014, but they&#x27;ve been bumped and I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ll ever be back at the top. Rather than a sea change, it looks like Google was just ahead of its competitors for a year, and now that year has come and gone.",1427828432

He pretty much killed ISO ISLisp, International Standard Lisp, a competing Lisp standardization effort that was a subset of Common Lisp just about the same size and flavor of Dylan. The ISLisp guys where mostly European lispers who were excluded from the Common Lisp ANSI standardization process, which was mostly an American venture backed by the DoD.<p>McCarthy didn't see technical merit to their claim for a separate standard, and he barred them from calling it ""Standard Lisp"". The wounds healed and the community reunited, but still, if the Europeans had a seat at the table we might have gotten a layered language, with a tiny kernel and several higher-level extensions, where vendors could advertise adherence to a Lisp ""level"" (e.g. ""CL0"" being a tiny Lispy VM with GC and LAP assembly, CL1 being primitive datatypes and special forms, and so on.)",1241232387

It might be the right time to spend more time on ad copy and less on product development, since you have four products, and I can't really figure out what any of them are for or why I would want to use them.

Sun, on the other hand, frequently has.  I'm also a bit more Open Source oriented than most people, and Sun has embraced Open Source in the past two years in ways few companies that weren't spawned of Open Source (like Red Hat) have ever done.  Folks think Google is very friendly to Open Source, but they haven't even begun to have the kind of impact that Sun has had over the years.  I may have gentler feelings towards Sun than some folks because of the contributions they've made to my own projects over the years (Sun was one of the very earliest contributors to Webmin, and has remained helpful ever since)...but since Sun has consistently been a friend to nearly every project I've ever had interaction with, and not just that one, I think it is built into their genes.  Oracle has never done anything nice for any project I've ever been involved in, so it's like 10 projects to zero in favor of Sun.  Being helpful (a deeply held hacker tradition) just doesn't seem to be in the character of Oracle, except when it is directly beneficial to them.",1241229953

I've heard that the prominent reason some funds tout themselves as woman-led is because some studies showed that women tended to get consistent although smaller returns then men-led funds.  Had to do with not taking big risks and making more calculated decisions.  This is all anecdotal of course.",1302199195

No doubt music videos etc. helped immensely but funny cat videos and other amateur goofy content was a big part of its success. Whereas with Grooveshark, I am fairly confident that  amateur authorized content doesn't factor into the equation.<p>That said, if the major music rights holders would just license to them from the start at affordable rates they wouldn't need to violate copyright so I suppose it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.",1302199069

2420443,comment,2420229,2420368,35,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>The open question is whether Google and Facebook will also end up in this same spot.</i><p>As you said, everyone will end up here.  There's virtually no way a rational company can avoid it.  It's textbook Innovator's Dilemma.  Eventually you're faced with a situation that there is a new product/service that is cannibalizing your product.  You can hasten the cannibalization of your cash cow and maybe succeed in this new space (or maybe not), or you can milk you cash cow for all its worth.  If you do the math its almost always better to <i>NOT</i> hasten your own demise for an uncertain future.<p>But even if you were to break them up, there's really no good way to break them up that really helps all that much.  Windows and Office?  Nothing else can really exist on its own.  Now you have two big monsters that have the same problems, but spread out in two companies.<p>I think you have to let nature take its course.  Which probably means some breakout technology that lets them continue their cash cow while providing new scenarios.  If Windows 8 can actually merge the desktop, tablet, and phone in a way never even envisioned, that would be a shot.  But it's such a long shot I wouldn't hold out much hope.",1302198708

I get the management culture and internal struggles and ""analysis paralysis"" that comes with the cover-your-butt mentality, but as far as I can tell, Microsoft is one of the very few companies that has entire departments dedicated bringing cutting-edge technologies to market.  The only other companies that comes close(that I've seen) are Google and perhaps Philips.  Talk to researches at elite technology schools, and I would venture to guess that they would put Microsoft far ahead of Apple, and maybe Google, in the innovation race.  However, if you talk management or P/E people, they would probably give you a different answer.  So I guess I'm in agreement that there's an internal problem at Microsoft, but that it lies with the culture, not the actual scope of their ability to innovate.",1302198046

I'm of the co-founders of NOLOH (<a href=""http://www.noloh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com</a>), a lightweight, on-demand web platform that's similar to cappuccino, GWT, etc, except that it's server-based and persistently lightweight, among other things.<p>Interestingly enough we started working on NOLOH in 2005, and released it to the public in a beta in 2008, and wide-release in 2009. One of the core premises of NOLOH, was that it should not break your existing HTML, JS, CSS, if you choose to use it, but rather allows you to incorporate it nicely while allowing NOLOH take care of the messy plumbing, such as race-conditions, syncing, etc. Even though, you can still use 3rd party tools, widgets, etc, without necessarily doing everything the ""NOLOH"" way, which might be similar in feel to the GWT way, or Cappucinno way, there's always resistance from those that feel that somewhere, somehow, some legacy thing will break and they won't have control over it, which is never the case in NOLOH, as even in a worst case scenario, everything is easily overrideable and customizable, but the problem still persists. So, now in 2011, where the proliferation of browsers and mobile devices each with their own set of quirks and issues, make something like NOLOH even more necessary, how do you get people to take the plunge to a development platform, whether it's NOLOH, or something else, that handles all the things that computers can do very well, and allow the developer to develop and focus on their application? This is especially frustrating, as I use Opera as my primary browser, and almost every day I'll encounter some site, or web app from some big co, or small development shop that doesn't work in Opera, and if they were using NOLOH, or something similar, this would never happen. There's just no reason for a modern browser to not work in a form submit (looking at you Crysis 2).<p>Interestingly enough the least resistance is in businesses, enterprises, and small developer shops, with the most resistance among individual developers and the ""elite"", who I feel have the most to gain. However, we have observed that when this particular group does take the plunge, usually after spending a significant amount of time researching, playing around, etc, they become very dedicated to the tool, and can't imagine developing without it. The problem then is when do we reach that tipping point, where no longer will you have to read how to x,y, or z, in HTML, JS, etc, or spend hours fighting with yourself over whether you should use a particular tool and allow the platform makers to worry about it, while you worry about your application.",1302197279

As a freshman in a math/science/engineering major, you take (or finish after beginning in high school) three semesters of Calculus, always referred to with a capital ""C"" to mean specifically Newton's calculus.  Here you learn to <i>calculate</i> integrals and derivatives so that you can use them as a tool.  If you major in math, then as a junior or senior you will take analysis.  Here is where you <i>rigorously study</i> integrals and derivatives.  An introductory analysis course typically begins by defining Cauchy sequences, and then defining the real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rationals.  Building on this foundation, you then construct the basic theory of continuous functions, derivatives, and Riemann integrals.  Finally, you use this theory to prove that the transformation rules of Newton's calculus are sound.",1302197012

You can use it and still keep HTML/CSS/etc (much like you would use CoffeeScript). Similarly, you can use it to, say, write command line apps for the terminal and never touch any web technology at all.<p>Separately, there is Cappuccino. I do not personally believe the situation to be either or (or not necessarily anyways). I think HTML and CSS are very powerful tools, given the right task (presenting documents). However, if I wanted to write super mario brothers, I would not miss lists and links, but would want strong graphical abilities. HTML has basically conceded this by adding the canvas element (which if you think about it goes against everything HTML is about -- semantic meaning). In the end, you should use the best tool for the task. For example, our GitHub issues app builds its chrome using Cappuccino, and displays the actual bug report as an HTMLView. No re-implementation of all of HTML, just literally loading HTML when we want it (Similar to how Mail's chrome is Cocoa, and the actual mail message rendering is an HTML WebView).<p>And, as you say at the end, of course it is only a matter of time until everything is ""post HTML/JS"". The fate of every language or framework is to either die or to be built on top of and abstracted away, there is no ""last technology"".",1302196414

Beyond that, the client either needs to pay you hourly for work, or you can offer a maintenance contract at a lower rate. You should also make sure you have a very detailed scope, and that every list item can be confidently checked off before you deliver it. On the same note, you also need to be strict about deadlines and payment terms, and make sure the client is getting billed for any requirements not explicitly scoped out in the initial quote.<p>With freelancing, the most important thing is to make sure your projects stay on schedule, and that you get paid.

The store will sell physical games that users can receive in the mail or pick up at a local store.<p>The move is part of GameStops strategy to stay relevant in the age of digital distribution of video games, since it doesnt want to go the way of the now defunct Hollywood Video and Tower Records chains. It also shows that Facebook is becoming a big distribution channel for retail sales in the emerging category of social commerce.<p>GameStop is tapping Adgregate Markets, a Sausalito, Calif.-based start-up that has already built about 50 stores for major brands on Facebook. GameStops store could be a big one since the chain already has about 1.8 million fans for its Facebook page. GameStop has made digital distribution a priority as a way to offset the potential decline of physical store sales.<p>By 2014, GameStop hopes that its digital game distribution businesses will generate more than $1.5 billion in revenue, or roughly 12.5 percent of its sales. But GameStop still has 6,600 stores and plans to expand overseas with new stores. The Facebook page is a way to more deeply engage with millions of fans who might otherwise not visit a store.<p>Adgregates system is directly tied into GameStops backend game web site so that the system can verify that inventory of a game is available at a local store, said John Underwood, chief operating officer of Adgregate Markets. And because the site is built on top of Facebook, the retailer can add merchandise Likes and Shares, gifting (buying a product for a friend) and group deals.<p>Adgregate, founded in 2008, has built more than 50 ShopFans stores on Facebook pages in the past year. Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop already ranks as the No. 115 retailer on Internet Retailers Top 500 list. Its new page is here.<p>Underwood said the Facebook user interface is moving from rigid templates to a real social shopping experience. Game fans will be able to pre-order the most-anticipated games and earn rewards via GameStops PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, which has more than 8 million members. Users can promote and discuss upcoming titles on the fan pages. Underwood said the overall social shopping experience is much more convenient than other ways to shop.<p>Adgregate charges a fee to build a custom site and charges a monthly fee and a per-transaction fee. For the most part, the service is aimed at large retailers rather than small, independent ones.",1302195707

I know that the content is up-to-date, but at a first visit it seems like the documentation of a language that is not maintained (which is false).

7943589,comment,7943365,7943531,32,0,ajanuary,,,"I agree; this point shouldn&#x27;t be about password reset emails being more secure, it should be about the fact you don&#x27;t need to be able to email them their password to have a successful account recovery process.<p>That said, it can be more secure. Firstly, people reuse passwords, so intercepting a plaintext password gives you access not only to the account on that site, but also several others.<p>Secondly, if the link expires you can&#x27;t use old account recovery emails to find out passwords. If you manage to compromise an account (rather than mitm), you can search through for old &quot;here is your password&quot; emails and use those without even having to initiate a new password recovery process, which in this age of mobile devices and push notifications risks the victim seeing the email and getting suspicious.",1403701084

With a temporary reset token, they have to initiate a password reset request, which you should notice: (a) you might notice the email if you have e.g. push notifications enabled, or if the attacker doesn&#x27;t delete it quickly enough, and (b) your real password will suddenly stop working.<p>Additionally, even if your reset request is harvested via MITM, if you use a single-use reset token, and an attacker uses it before you can, you know something is up. Even if it&#x27;s not single-use, your password suddenly no longer working should ring alarm bells.",1403701028

For many common image editing tasks like rotating, cropping, resizing, saving in a different image format, some simple levels, exposure, saturation, sharpening and white balance adjustments as well as a few mark up tools (adding text, arrows, various shapes) Preview is perfectly adequate.<p>That’s probably more than enough for people who don’t actually create any images. Maybe the photo editing is a bit anaemic, but Photoshop’s photo editing tools are cryptic and hard to use for occasional users and those probably benefit a lot more from a simple editing panel with a few relevant sliders than from all the hard to unlock power of Photoshop.<p>The only notable absent thing is some sort of image straightening tool (only 90° rotations are possible).<p>If you want to do actual image editing there are a couple of excellent apps, namely Acorn and Pixelmator, both modern and frequently updated.

What comes from us within the Erlang community seems to often be a repeat of itself.<p>- Killer apps? done (Riak, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Whatsapp, etc.)\n- Commercial use? done (Telcos, game companies, and so on)\n- Books? Done, 4-5 of them, getting more and more specialized even.\n- Static Type system? Well you can use Dialyzer and get some of it.<p>The last things that seem to come up all the time are about documentation, the syntax, possibly renaming OTP (do people really get bogged down so much on an acronym?), and package management.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt to me a lot of work needs to be done regarding package management, but all previous attempts within the community more or less failed to bring something consistent, and we have rebar instead, with people fetching sources from git repositories and building them locally without always having proper versionning (and conflict resolution).<p>Outside of this, there&#x27;s little doubt in my mind that the unfamiliarity is the big issue, along with how hard it is to think in Erlang: nothing shared, immutable, with a Prolog look. Outside of all the rest, this is what I feel is the hardest, and fixing it means &quot;don&#x27;t be Erlang&quot; (because books and whatnot seem to have a limited effect), which well, won&#x27;t work as a solution for Erlang.",1403700159

The cliff in that chart comes when the indefinite extension of copyright began in the early 20th century. It blew a massive hole in our cultural record.<p>You&#x27;ll see the same story in film, and in software, though we have no pre-indefinite-copyright data to compare to. There&#x27;s an era between roughly 1930 and 1980 where works that would have gone into the public domain, no longer are -- and because they are locked away, they are being forgotten or entirely lost. We enjoy the Eternal Sunshine of the Copyrighted Mind.<p>Though it&#x27;s not a <i>reason</i> to allow copyright to expire, it&#x27;s also worth noting that copyright expiration is required by the US Constitution. A copyright law that didn&#x27;t include an expiration date would be unconstitutional. In practice, of course, a continually-increasing-yet-finite time is hard to distinguish from forever.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/the-hole-in-our-collective-memory-how-copyright-made-mid-century-books-vanish/278209/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/the-ho...</a>",1403699569

Spritz&#x27;s particular method of RSVP applies research into the optimal positioning of words to reduce or eliminate saccades (rapid movement of the eye).  This is called ORP-RSVP (the ORP stands for Optimal Recognition Position).<p>I would think that if you are opposed to the idea of software patents in general, you would no doubt be opposed to this particular software patent.<p>But if you are not necessarily opposed to all software patents, but only the ones that try to patent something trivial, or try to add the words &quot;on a computer&quot; to an established real-world practice, then the question arises: Is Spritz&#x27;s method, which positions words according to an algorithm that is meant to reduce saccades, trivial?  One could argue that because it&#x27;s an actively researched problem, it&#x27;s not.<p>But even if you think that Spritz has a chance of getting its patent accepted, a further question arises: Does Squirt&#x27;s implementation of ORP-RSVP use the method that Spritz is trying to patent, or some other similar method?  I imagine there are probably a bunch of different ORP-RSVP methods, and it&#x27;s not immediately clear whether Squirt&#x27;s method is a true clone.  It could very well end up that even though Squirt is heavily implying that it&#x27;s using the patent-pending technology, it&#x27;s actually using a different method.",1403699000

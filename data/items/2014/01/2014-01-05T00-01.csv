7013865,comment,7012151,7012564,6,0,dredmorbius,,,"Without absolving the textbook industry (prices are nuts, have been for ages, dig up Supreme Court Justice Stephens&#x27; essay on the topic from the 1960s/1970s), this is in some ways a problem of the market-capitalist system.  It&#x27;s similar to the issues of equitable pay, automation, labor displacement, and business models for the arts, music, newspapers, and publishing in general.  Oh, and this little thing called software.<p>In order to produce material, a certain amount of resources are necessary.  The mechanism we&#x27;ve adopted for allocating those resources is the market.  For much of present production, the fixed costs of production are high -- writing a book (particularly a textbook) is a large initial investment.  Same goes for software.  The <i>marginal</i> costs of production are low -- hell, you can download a 400 page text off of Project Gutenberg or stream a movie in a few seconds with a decent broadband connection.  Amortize the costs of your laptop (a few hundred dollars for a basic model, a grand or two for high end), less for tablets or eBook readers), and a broadband subscription, and it&#x27;s still cheap.<p>Textbooks generally do have to be updated every so often, though annual revisions are pretty ridiculous, and much of the industry is a fat scam, especially where the professor teaches from his own text.  Rental schemes, &quot;authorization codes&quot; (required to access other materials), and the like factor into this as well -- they&#x27;re akin to various tack-on fees for air travel.  And there&#x27;s a whole burgeoning movement for producing DIY book scanners and the like (pretty fascinating, do a quick DDG search or hit up Fixyt.com for videos).  One thing I&#x27;ve come to realize about many commercial opportunities is that they require a control and toll-taking point.  Revision updates, exercise questions, registrations, rentals, and the like, all create an arbitrary tollgate.  Great for the publisher, for the student, not so much.<p>And the model requires that for a new or continued revenue stream, new books have to be published.  I&#x27;m beginning to strongly suspect this is a market failure -- of externalities (the educational value of those books benefits more than just the reader) and perverse incentives.<p>The question is:  what&#x27;s the better way?  Online we&#x27;ve been experimenting with vastly democratized publishing, and the result is Upworthy, Buzzfeed, HuffPo, and numerous other viral sites, which with time are finding their way into my hosts file with &#x27;0.0.0.0&#x27; entries, and search-engine blocklists.  It leads to what Clay Shirky recognizes as a problem, not of data overload, but of filter failure.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem within the publishing world, including academic publishing, of so much material being produced that not only is it not possible to keep up with it, even within a discipline or sub-specialty, but that <i>good content is getting buried</i>.  That&#x27;s the real tragedy of broken filters -- not the crap spewing everywhere, but the gold nuggets that don&#x27;t float up.",1388883592

And the task is a database query so probably does not use the RNG.<p>But yes, I have seen a similar case involving linux /dev/random - the user reported that outgoing emails were sometimes delayed for hours and that moving a mouse over a VNC window would sometimes speed it up.  I did not believe that at first, but it was exim4 running out of entropy when generating TLS session keys.  Worse, it was on a VPS with about 20 exim4 processes competing for the entropy.",1388883590

7013855,comment,7011472,7011669,2,0,bborud,,,"Two facts:<p>a) PageRank is just one of several hundred factors used for determining ranking.  Search engine ranking is a lot more complicated than even most information retrieval-programmers tend to think.<p>b) There may have been a window of a few weeks or months in 99/00 where not every major search engine used some form of link-based ranking, but it was, as noted, a very brief period.<p>It always amazes me that people for almost 15 years now have believed in the myth of PageRank&#x27;s uniqueness and power.  I would like to challenge people to think about two things:<p>- how useful do you think a pure static ranking of web tens of billions of web pages is?  Think about what it represents.  What does it mean to assign one page higher rank than another?<p>- do you <i>really</i> believe that other search engines would not have implemented PageRank or something similar?  Do you really think that search engine designers do not read papers and apply every trick in the book that they can manage to implement in a scalable manner?<p>There are lots of hard problems you need to solve if you want to build a web scale search engine.  If ranking becomes your biggest problem:  that would be a luxury.  The biggest hurdle today is money to buy computing power and storage.   The time when you could build a competitive web scale search engine for regular startup-money is over.  It has been over for close to a decade.<p>It saddened me greatly when Yahoo threw in the towel because it meant that search in the western world was effectively a two-horse race.

7013846,comment,7012239,7013331,3,0,drewcrawford,,,"Your argument is essentially that one can write slow things in Python and fast things in C, and that this solves the majority of problems (let&#x27;s even be generous and call it 98% of them that fit neatly into these two categories).  The trouble here is that &quot;the number of programs&quot; is a large number, and 2% of a large number is still large, and leaves important classes of programs without a good solution.<p>One class of programs left out in the cold is the network server.  Now a network server must respond to a large number of requests.  From a basic software engineering perspective, a 16-core machine should be responding to AT LEAST 16 requests at once (much more if some of the requests are IO bound).  So the network server needs some kind of parallel processing (whether threads, subprocesses, or whatever you want to suggest).  Under your philosophy, programs that need threading (thus all network servers) should not be written in Python, but somebody should be stepping down to C.  While it is probably true that a very small minority of network servers should not be written in Python, the broader claim is absurd; you should be able to write reasonably-performing network servers in Python with relative ease.  It is, after all, a server-side language; &quot;writing a server&quot; should be very high on the list of &quot;things you can do&quot;.<p>Now more broadly, the existence of greenlet, Twisted, gevent, and their popularity (we&#x27;re talking top-100 packages here) speak to the fact that there are a LOT of python programmers who have threading-related requirements.  Are they on crack?  Now mix in the new standard library stuff like asyncio (3.4) and threading is clearly an important enough issue to get major attention from the core committers.  Are <i>they</i> on crack?<p>Now you might operate in a world where every time you need threads is an isolated case and it&#x27;s fairly simple to drop down to C.  But there are a lot of people (in absolute terms; I don&#x27;t know if they are in the majority) where when they want threads the right solution is to use threads.<p>The thing I hear from the core committers whenever the GIL comes up is &quot;if we worked on the GIL, we would be taking lots of time away from more important things.&quot;  But when you look at the things they work on instead--unicode, iterators, ordered dictionaries, argparse, etc.--plenty of people in this thread are insufficiently motivated to upgrade.  Are ordered dictionaries really more important than GIL work?  To me, the answer is clear.  I would rather have some progress on the GIL problem than every single py3k feature combined.",1388883181

7013838,comment,7004935,7009269,1,0,whatevsbro,,,"> I think that if you gave your kid enough Cola to where it was universally accepted to cause major long term harm to them - CPS would come take that kid from you and you would likely be arrested for child endangerment (thus it is against the law).<p>Oh? Well, what if you spank your child? -That certainly causes psychological harm. Does CPS take people&#x27;s children away for clearly causing long term harm to them in that way?<p>> Secondly the govt is not forcibly preventing you from uncensored internet. It is the ISPs, and not forcibly, all you have to do is acknowledge that you want it (this could hardly be considered forcible)<p>This has been covered elsewhere. But you do realize that it&#x27;s the government that runs those block lists, and that they can put whatever they want in there, don&#x27;t you? For example, I don&#x27;t think China approves of Chinese people reading naughty anti-government material. You see, people need to be protected from something so disconcerting and potentially harmful (to the government itself).<p>> How does that kid get at the soda? usually their parents or caretaker gives it to them right? Is that how they usually run across porn randomly on the web too? Maybe parents should watch kids every second they are online, but that is hardly possible with the ubiquity of internet devices today. At least if a kid sneaks a Cola at 2am whilst his parents are asleep - it is clearly missing the next day. Not so obvious if they were sneaking out and surfing the web incognito.<p>They&#x27;re going to be exposed to porn and even actively seek it out eventually anyway. I&#x27;m not saying little kids should be watching porn, but I&#x27;m not sure it would harm them either.

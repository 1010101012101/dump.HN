At the same time they are not going to be fired if the service is down, as &quot;eveybody is down right now&quot;.

The whole point of polyfills is to patch browser incompatibilities, often times without losing any performance to newer browsers, so you can provide the best experience to half the people in the world on newer browsers and a mediocre experience to the rest, instead of a mediocre experience for everyone.

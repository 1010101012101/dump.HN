Later that night, according to the OSHA files, Kà’s assistant head rigger found the rigger who had been on Guillot-Guyard’s line curled in a ball and crying. He was saying, “I felt the rope go through my hand.”<p>There may have been nothing he could have done. Ascending with her legs extended, instead of in a tuck—as witnesses testified—Guillot-Guyard collided with the grid. According to the OSHA report, “This collision caused a shock load to the winch; the wire rope came out of the sheave/pulley and scraped against a shear point cutting numerous wires in the wire rope. The wire rope broke apart.” Or as Pearson explained, “The cable jumped out of the pulley wheel and was exposed to the sharp edges of the mounting frame. This happened in a split second, almost instantaneously with the moment of impact. [The] cable got slammed against the edge of the wheel and into the sharp edge of the plate that was behind it, and that cut the cable.”</i>",1450097523

You can&#x27;t control how large or small the value is.

Avast has essentially chosen to hijack your web browser’s security without your permission, inserting itself as a silent watcher into all your secure communications.<p>If you&#x27;ve installed a program with administrative privileges, it already has total, unrestricted access to your machine. There may be a reason to be concerned about this, but it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re getting some access that the user has not already granted by installing the software.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of blacklist-based security like AV, I think it&#x27;s basically useless. But if the filtering features of Avast are something you want for some reason, this seems a legitimate way to do it. The alternative is to read this data directly from browsers memory (they can do this with the access they already have), which is likely to break at every update and require a huge amount of programming effort.",1450094696

Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat&#x27;s comments about the mathematics of General Relativity were beyond my understanding, but there is much to learn from her discussion of how her relationship with Einstein developed.<p>If you want to explore this topic from another point of view, get to know the work of Jeremy Bernstein, a theoretical physicist and long-time writer for The New Yorker. Bernstein also spent some time at the IAS when he was a young scientist, and has written a great deal about Einstein.",1450094584

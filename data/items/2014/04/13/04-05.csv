Job boards are dying (so is SEO, right!?) and with the advent of LinkedIn, I can easily find the recruiters or hiring managers in the companies I want to work.<p>But people will always need a way to find open positions.  That&#x27;s what job boards are all about.<p>The landscape may be changing, but there is still opportunities to do things better.<p>JobKaster was built because the other 100K job boards couldn&#x27;t do what we wanted them to - a simple local job search.<p>Traditional job boards use a zip code based search using distance from the zip code. It seems that this would work, but when I was searching and ended up frustrated, the results were returning up jobs 15 miles out of my specified range.<p>I think the difference here is the fact that location becomes the most important aspect of the job search where on the other job boards, it is simply another filter.<p>If you work for one of the big job boards, you probably have several niche boards under your umbrella as well.  Each of those serve a specific niche which is the same thing we are trying to do.<p>We want to help people find jobs when location is paramount.  I hated my commute, and I just wanted to find something closer to home.  My Co-Founder, wanted to find a job close to the beach.  But what about others?  What about the single mom that wants to be close to her child&#x27;s day care?  What about the guys and gals taking public transportation to work?  What about students trying to find something close to campus?  I could name 100&#x27;s of examples, and I think JobKaster fits that niche quite well.<p>I would love to talk about this more in depth, especially with someone who has so much experience in job boards.

I fear I will soon have angry atheists & feminists demanding that I step down from my job for uttering a religious phrase.

It&#x27;s really sad :-( MLK & Ghandi would be sad.<p>Feminism has been preaching sexism for a long time. Their tactic of demonizing anybody who dares to disagree with them are well known and advanced. It sucks to be a heterosexual male in America.

So all of you can feel better for judging others who are less &quot;progressive&quot; than you. I wonder if there will be a progressive 1%, because the progressive middle class is getting hollowed out.<p>That&#x27;s ok I guess. All good things get tired and must end.

So you would want to never pass a raw array as a function argument, but before compound literals there was fundamentally no good way to change a string literal to such a structure in a function argument that wouldn&#x27;t violate other basic programming principles.  There are still a variety of implementation choices and it is by no means an easy retrofit, but the result can be entirely reasonable.  Interacting with 3rd party and standard library code can be awkward and depends on implementation choices (e.g. &#x27;\\0&#x27; termination or not and the related how much of libc do you rewrite).  There have been a number of string libraries over the years making various implementation choices, but no general implementation has become all that popular and it seems like most implementations are project specific.",1397362259

Also I do not have a problem with selling stuff under a proprietary license and then selling the same thing for more money under an open source license.<p>My issue is 100% the association of the word Open Source with proprietary software. Yes, even the enterprise license is proprietary. I think we have a big issue in the software world with confusion about what makes something open source. Part of this is because web software skirts the GPL and so some people have come to see Open Source as for the benefit of the developer.<p>Open Source is about the user. It is about giving the user freedoms, not saving developers money.<p>Now, the enterprise license is interesting. It is better than the introduction licenses and I think is 90% to the four freedoms. The only thing is the requirement to only distribute modified source. Which is a weird requirement since one need only add a no-op.<p>If I was running BinPress I&#x27;d inverse things. iOS devs and devs of proprietary software do not want to make their software open source, so charge them for the ability to use your library without distributing their code. This is the dual license business model and it can work well.

Well, first cut, &#x27;measure&#x27; is just\na grown up version of ordinary area.  Simple.<p>Why interested in measure theory?  Because want to\ncook up a new way to do integration, that is, what\nfreshman calculus dues with the Riemann integral.\nRecall, the Riemann integral partitions the X axis\nand approximates the area under the curve with \ntall, thin rectangles.  Measure theory partitions\nthe Y axis:  At first glance this seems a little\nclumsy, but in the usual cases get the same number\nfor area under a curve and in bizarre cases, that\ncan get from converging functions, get a nice \nanswer that Riemann integration can&#x27;t do.<p>Royden likes Littlewood&#x27;s three principles, and\nthey are cute.  So, spend an evening on them.\nYes, it&#x27;s possible to use Littlewood&#x27;s to do\nthe subject, but there is a better way, also\nheavily in Royden, roughly called &#x27;monotone\nclass arguments&#x27; -- which are gorgeous and turn\nmuch of the whole book into something quite simple.\nSo, prove the theorem for indicator functions.\nThen extend to simple functions by linearity.\nThen extend to non-negative measurable functions by \na monotone sequence.  Then extend to integrable\nfunctions by linearity.  Can knock off much of the\nbook this way, e.g., Fubini&#x27;s theorem which\nis just interchange of order of integration grown up.\nThe foundations of this\nlittle four step process is Fatou&#x27;s lemma, \nthe monotone convergence theorem, and the\ndominated convergence theorem.<p>About 2/3rds of the way through Royden is\na single chapter that essentially compresses\nmuch of the rest of the book -- I would have\nto step into my library to find the chapter.<p>For the early exercises on upper and lower\nsemi-continuity, they are a bit much and\nyou likely won&#x27;t see that topic again.\nSo that exercise can be skipped.<p>Royden is elegant beyond belief; if you still\nhave trouble finding the main themes, then\nchat for an hour with a good math proof\nwho understand Royden well.<p>Then, don&#x27;t miss the Radon-Nikodym theorem:\nIt can be seen as a grown up version of the\nfundamental theorem of freshman calculus but, really,\nis much, much better.

6737986,comment,6734607,6736285,2,0,mind_heist,,,">&quot;I&#x27;d go as far as to say that the first world&#x27;s biggest asset is the collective trust it has accrued over the centuries.&quot;<p>Interesting, This is a trait that I often find myself admiring about the societies in the west (ie) the Trust that the System has in its people that they wouldn&#x27;t cheat or exploit. I sometimes thought the System didn&#x27;t &#x27;go after&#x27; the people who exploit it, since it simply wasn&#x27;t worth the Return on Investments to put checks in place to catch them. I recently traveled to Los Angeles and took the LAX Fly Away (a paid shuttle service) to get to union station. Passengers paid for the ticket at the destination in booth located ~100 meters away & and claimed the baggage using the receipt. But if you did not have any luggage or had only a backpack -- you could simply walk away without paying nothing. There are multiple exits at the food court in my workplace,and you could simply walk away without paying at the counter. Systems like these shocked me initially , it seemed like a glaring loophole but I quickly understood the priciple behind it - &quot;the collective trust the society has accrued over the centuries.&quot;<p>The more I saw these, the principle grew on me. I became less skeptical about the intentions of people and automatically started giving &quot;goodness&quot; points ..even to random people. Prior to seeing this system , I would generally employ far more scrutiny  about people and assume they had evil \nintentions by default ( this is sometimes subjective).<p>But I did find myself on the receiving end once: I was trying to buy tickets for a Bon Jovi concert a few months ago that was supposed to be held at the HP Pavilion in San Jose. Since the show was sold out, I was looking for deals on CraigsList.I m not a die-hard fan of Bon Jovi and wasn&#x27;t desperate for the tickets. I called a few people , a lot of them were selling tickets at the face value - I kept eliminating sellers since they were far , or didn&#x27;t have the number of tickets I wanted or .. were selling &#x27;crappy seats -20$ tickets&#x27;. I finally ran into a Lady who was selling four tickets & quoted 240$ for all of them. I asked for the seat number and I couldn&#x27;t make much from the seating chart. I thought it might be a overhanging balcony or something. I blindly requested if she could  drop the prices, and she offered those tickets for 200$ after quickly consulting with her husband. She kept telling thats what they paid , had receipts.. etc.,etc.,<p>Since these were hard tickets I had to meet them in person to collect the tickets. I said I lived in Palo Alto and.. after a quick consultation with her husband again, she mentioned I could meet her husband at Starbucks in Palo Alto the next morning. Turns out he works for facebook and it wasn&#x27;t a detour for him. She handed over the phone to him , we exchanged numbers and he asked about where I worked in Palo Alto. I mention the name of my company .. a virtualization giant with 10K+ employees HQed in Palo Alto. He throws a a few names, and ..bang ..starts mentioning the name of my Manager, My director and others . He said he worked with them a few years ago , and I was convinced I was dealing with someone nice. I quickly obliged to the timing he mentioned and closed the deal.I was trying to be nice & asked if I needed to transfer money over paypal. He said it was alright. I ran into my boss after this conversation , mentioned this dude&#x27;s name and he immediately recognized him. My boss has a very_common_first_name@gmail.com , and I always wonder how he got that account . Years ago , My boss had received a beta invite to create a google account from this dude who worked for Google as well. He spoke of him as a smart person , I came back to my desk and googled for him. There were videos of him explaining how &quot;Release Management&quot; worked in &quot;Facebook&quot;.. and how he approves/rejects check-ins, looking at the comment traffic on the review request etc.,  This person was totally legit.<p>I got up early next day, drove to the Starbucks we had decided to meet at. I noticed this mid/late 30&#x27;s person with scruffy beard meddling with his phone. I recognized and walked up to him . He looked up .. clasped my hands and gave a tight handshake , quickly took his wallet out. I took the cash out of my pocket as well .. he irreverently threw four tickets on the table. I handed over the money to him ..picked up the tickets & immediately realized those were four 20$ tickets.. which a bunch of other folks were trying to sell me at face value.  I didn&#x27;t protest ..and simply let him walk away in all the glory of having capitalized the situation. This was a man who has been in three Pre-IPO comapanies as a release engineer or manager : my company , google and facebook. All through I kept assuming , I was buying something  for a fair price. I &quot;trusted&quot; he was acting with a reasonable frame of mind ; I gave him &quot;goodness&quot; points for he too has a part in the &quot;accrued collective trust&quot;.. I didn&#x27;t even feel bad for paying those extra dollars .. I couldn&#x27;t wrap my head around why someone with so much credentials would behave this way. After all, there are people who constantly dent this &quot;collective trust&quot;.",1384494988

There is some ongoing development on predicting couple of main things: \n1) Would a particular person be potentially a good candidate for certain role.

These factors would be used to predict the users who share the traits and would likely land in a similar position. \n2) Predikt the probability of job hopping, likelyhood of someone being a passive job seeker, potential salary ranges the candidate falls into.<p>Right now, Linkedin and facebook integration are functional, certainly it would be more useful to add all possible networks.

While there is arguably opportunity cost involved, it is not at all difficult to avoid &quot;racking up debt&quot; in grad school, at least if you&#x27;re at the PhD level and in a STEM field.  It is standard in such programs to get tuition waived (so, no cost) and to receive stipends for assistantship or fellowship (so, you get paid).<p>To get into specifics: I got my PhD in CS from Brown ten years ago, and my stipend was around $20K (I think about $22 or $23K my final year).  During my time there the students clamoured for, and received, a healthcare benefit (free for the student, and they could pay extra if they had spouse and/or dependents).  Because I was lucky enough to be debt-free going in, I actually finished grad school with about $15K in savings, but even my friends who had debt from ugrad were not accruing additional debt (and at the time were able to defer payment interest-free, although I gather that&#x27;s no longer true).  I was not exactly living the high life but was able to afford a decent apartment, ate out fairly regularly, and kept myself supplied with geeky tools and toys (laptop, wifi, etc).<p>So no, &quot;racking up debt&quot; is not a worry here.",1384491628

If the singularity itself poses existential risks (this seems obvious,) and if extinction is inevitable without a singularity (this seems likely,) ... </i><p>The answer is trivially ""no"". It's easy to imagine a future in which we continue to exist and the Singularity never arrives. Perhaps the rate of progress will continue to increase at a decreasing rate. Perhaps it will go linear, or even sigmoid. Perhaps we will achieve a Kardashev Type I civilization without ever going properly singular. It's not a given and perhaps not even likely that singularity is synonymous with the survival of our species.<p>We have the existence proof for general intelligence embodied in about ~3 lbs of protein. No more, no less. Being <i>certain</i> of the inevitability of the Singularity is closer to religious than skeptical thinking.",1274335156

I don't really have any hard data to prove this of course, just assuming based on the fact that most startups do it this way.<p>Finally, based on the little bit that I've read, it's the initial setup (servers, IPs, subscribe/unsubscribe requests) that takes effort. But once it's automated, things will be humming along nicely, provided there's regular periodic monitoring of course.<p>I'm pretty sure startups run email delivery in-house for the reasons above and more.

A child comment somewhere within a low-voted comment's descendants saying ""why am I getting downvoted?"" has the potential to call off the latch-on-downvoting effect, and thus give the comment a chance to spike upward.

Still, how many of their users stay on 1.3 because of those same principles? How many just go and compile their own (un-secured) version of Apache 2.x instead?<p>OpenBSD has two major driving philosophies that I'm aware of - freedom of code and security of code - but in this case I have to wonder which one is more important. Is it more important to be as free as possible, even knowing that most (competent) admins will replace the secured Apache 1.3 with the non-OpenBSD-secured 2.2? Or should OpenBSD relent and include a secured Apache 2.2 in the default install, even though it's <i>not as free as they would like</i>, despite still being arguably 'free'.<p>As a pragmatist, I'd much rather have a secured 'slightly less free' OpenBSD install vs. a 'less secured' 'slightly less free' OpenBSD install.

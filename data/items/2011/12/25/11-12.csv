3390892,comment,3389678,3390680,1,0,danteembermage,,,"That is correct, if you raise interest rates you get a sudden and immediate increase in the value of your currency, followed by a slow decline, instead of a sudden decline followed by a long term increase. That's why the increase could be misleading, if  XYZ currency goes from trading at the same price as the $US to trading at 1/10 the price and slowly increase up to 1/2 it is true that at some point over the life of the currency it has increased 500% but I wouldn't call that an argument in favor of the economic health of the country.

I can infer what folks above me are trying to tell me to do, but the phrase used is a case of institutional memory and the process described/referenced is obsolete. No one has bothered to update the phrasing to fit the current situation and newer employees then don't get a detailed explanation of what it means (what the goal or purpose is) so it is slowly turning into gibberish.

As software developers, we have a hard time understanding the rationale of some of the code we wrote last week, let alone someone else's code from a year ago (I don't want to imagine any of my company's code running 30 years from now!).<p>In a recent series of design meetings I was running for a large project, I started to tackle some of these problems by emailing out the final decisions we had made at the end of each meeting. The following week we'd still have problems in understanding/remembering the chain of arguments that led to the final decisions, and we'd lose some time re-tracing our steps. So I then adjusted to not only summarizing the decisions at the end of each meeting, but noting step by step the arguments/debates that led to it. Then at the beginning of each meeting I'd review them to the group. This worked, but it was an awful lot of note taking.<p>I almost wonder that now that more and more of these discussions are done through work email, IM, version controlled documentation (and code), the job of future archaeologists will be much more manageable (though still hard and fraught with risk). Maybe more and more tools will develop to piece together a project's evolution, rationale, and implicit assumptions and decisions.",1324811414

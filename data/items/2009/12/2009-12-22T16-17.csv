1010228,comment,1009953,1009953,0,0,rpdillon,,,"This post manages to completely miss the point of the Google letter on openness.<p>As some have incorrectly asserted, Google's latest post is  <i>not</i> about ""everything open"", it is an <i>internal</i> memo to product managers that it occurred to them would be fit for public consumption.<p>The central thesis of the letter is that ""open"" is hard to define (and defined differently by different people) and yet crucially important.  Because it is hard to define, many people misuse it (OpenDNS comes to mind), and no one can call them on it because it is a vague term.<p>Internally, Google employees argue about what open  means, and the purpose of this letter was to clarify what open means to Google.  They lay it out in extremely clear terms, and it is well structured.<p>This response essay by Dixon misses all that completely - he unilaterally defines ""open"" to mean ""open source"", and then asks for Google to give away their software, claiming that if they don't, they're hypocrites.<p>Going back to Google's definition of ""open"" (which is complex), one significant aspect they emphasize is the notion of ""lock-in"", i.e. locking in users, and locking out competitors.  This is one area where Google puts their money where their mouth is; they let users leave.  You can get at your email, export your Google Reader content, download all your Google Docs, archive your Picasa pictures, and export all your contacts.  That means if a competitor comes along with something better, you can start using it.  Try that with Facebook.<p>Dixon acting like that is worthless because it isn't the ""open-source"" form of ""open"" is patently absurd.  If this is confusing, I highly recommend reading Simon Phipps essays on open source to understand what kind of software makes a good candidate for a business to open source (operating systems, browsers, compilers...the basics that we all use to compete) and what does not (grid/cloud computing algorithms, specialized software, and other types of software that are differentiators).  Essentially, the business model is to pool our collective resources in areas in which we don't want to compete (web server software, operating systems) and to spend time innovating in areas we do wish to compete (search algorithms, voice recognition, image analysis, etc.)  Over time, as those specialized areas become more mainstream, they become better candidates for open-sourcing.",1261501171

1010226,comment,1009953,1010191,0,0,mbreese,,,"I believe that Communism is largely an economic system with politics being aside effect of the economic model.  For example, the opposite of Communism isn't democracy, it's capitalism.  And actually, in the purest sense, Communism is completely about decision making.  According to that bastion of scholarly thought Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>    ""Pure communism"" in the Marxian sense refers to a classless, stateless and 
    oppression-free society where decisions on what to produce and what policies 
    to pursue are made democratically, allowing every member of society to 
    participate in the decision-making process in both the political and economic 
    spheres of life.

Language learners do it all the time, figuring out how to talk around concepts that they don't know the words for.  It's a bit harder to learn all the subtle and idiomatic ways people have of expressing things that they have a concept of but which aren't grammatically encoded in their language, but that's only necessary for fluency.  It's <i>much</i> harder to constantly be aware of things that a language forces you to always know, but which you are used to thinking about only if there is a special reason they are relevant, such as direction in Kuuk Thaayorre, source of knowledge in Tuyuca, and fine degrees of hierarchy and intimacy in Japanese and some other Asian languages.<p>Studying Japanese, I often resented the need to be aware of social hierarchy.  By contrast, I would love to develop my directional awareness, and I think I would appreciate the discipline imposed by Kuuk Thaayorre!  I naturally mentally lay places out on a grid which is much straighter in my mind than in reality.  I ""know"" a place when my mind automatically fixes the mismatch between grid orientation and reality.<p>By the way, is anybody besides me ridiculously linguistically impressionable?  The latest thing for me is getting my singulars and plurals mixed up, and spitting out tiny sentence fragments that can be completed from context but which sound childish in English, all because of the influence of my Korean girlfriend.  I got an 800 on my verbal SATs, and this is horribly embarrassing and traumatic for me.",1261500947

Low taxation eventually reaches anarchy as the government is no longer in control.<p>Increasing birth rates enables economies to grow without becoming stagnant and old, placing undue demand due to pensions. An exceptionally high birth rate creates food production problems, housing problems, and generally the 'sardine can' effect. Low birthrates create a stagnant civilization that will eventually reach a tipping point when taxes get so high to pay for pensions that the younger generations will protest.<p>Market freedom to the extreme leads to monopolies taking advantage, 'gentlemen's agreements' between companies to price fix and many other problems that rules and regulations try to control. Equally a controlled market develops problems in and of itself as it's unable to respond naturally to market fluctuations, and quickly becomes unruly and unstable, and as many of the countries who have held long-term controlled markets are testaments to, they develop massive black-market economies to deal with these.<p>The zealous burning of fossil fuels, aside from global warming concerns, can expel vast quantities of radioactive materials, sulfurous emissions and a long list of things we've accepted in western society as being more harmful than smoking to the wide populations health, but rules and regulations on air quality increasingly get more lax (at least they have been where I live). With zero fossil fuel production, however, our civilization would collapse (at least with an immediate stop to production), and I'm not just talking the halting of transportation vehicles, I'm talking the stop in production of the advanced polymers used in virtually all aspects of our lives. The majority of people wouldn't have clothes on their back . . . my wardrobe would certainly be a lot cheaper if my clothes were all genuine cotton and wool. Oh and farewell cheap elasticated sweatpants.<p><i>Every</i> good idea taken to its extreme is a bad idea and will create monumental problems in its wake. Electric vehicles are amazing, however a pure-electric is a ridiculous prospect in winter when the capacity hits below 60% of room-temperature, suddenly your vehicle can't get you to work and back on a single charge. Zero integration of hybrids is, as everyone knows, damaging to the environment but also an extreme waste of entropy.

I mean, I understand some skepticism but this, to me, is pretty extreme IP-fetishism.<p>It's perfectly understandable. Lots of money is made in the existing paradigm and so many of you have incentive to believe it's the most rational system. Besides, hard to imagine Google's doing something wrong, right?<p>But the argument that ""the only people this will help is spammers""? Really? Are the only people helped by open cryptographic protocols those who look to decipher traffic?<p>""They have every right to keep it secret and profit off of it."" Let's allow this for a moment. We've still got a false dichotomy. Making it public will not deprive them of their profit. First, incredible marketing coup. Does anyone else remember how much of Google's initial strength came from its rabid fans? This would do a lot of re-energize that base.<p>Second, are there going to be new startups which can effectively compete with Google, even given its algorithm? How are they going to provide a better experience, or serve the volume of traffic, or index a larger amount of pages with the same algorithm with fewer resources?<p>Third, who says they have to authorize competitors to use it? This is I think one of the more interesting points. They could release the algorithm but license it only for non-commercial use for anyone not themselves. Ridiculous? Because Microsoft would violate such a deal anyhow? Because the algorithm could simply be reimplemented? Perhaps. But it would be another roadblock.<p>Fourth, why do we continue to believe that Google's strength comes from proprietary code? Why do we not recognize that its strength comes from mindshare, user experience, and quality of execution? None of which would be negatively affected by releasing the source.<p>Perhaps Google would face heightened competition as a result of releasing its algorithm. Perhaps this would outweigh the benefits of doing so. But there would be significant good which would result, including public feedback which would make it significantly harder for spammers to be successful.<p>But I'm just a foaming-at-the-mouth open source radical.

solutions.  At this point if there is still a conflict and the vote is

more valuable than both ideas combined.  The insights the founders will
receive from attempting the solution should make it obvious which
solution is best.<p>Lastly if conflicts are cropping up on a consistent basis, if the

These are the pieces of code that without which you can't make even a passing claim of competency in a language.  I'm thinking about the crib sheet of functions/definitions/language features you have to have ready to go in your toolbox so you can code fast.  It's the stuff you'd want candidates to demonstrate knowledge of in an interview as well and be able to apply at least in conversation to a new problem.<p>I'm interested in figuring this out for a multitude of reasons, not least of which is retention of knowledge related.  Years ago, I hacked in C for performance reasons in the domain I was working in  Lots of pointer junk, tiling of data (interleaving of row and column data to blow up memory bottlenecks), and a healthy dose of bit twiddling to make it all work nicely.  I realized not too long ago that most of these skills had faded due to lack of use.<p>I'm playing some with spaced repetition software for memory training (think SuperMemo and Mnemosyne) and thinking about plugging in those pieces of programming languages that you have to be ready to throw out to code fast in a language.  I'm just testing for now, but I think I might even try throwing something like the question/answer pieces from The Little Lisper in there for fun.  Kind of a daily brain teaser.<p>Since I spend most of my time at work hacking SQL, it's pretty easy for me to stay fresh and also identify the minimum set of concepts and ideas you need to even think you can write halfway decent SQL:  SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,JOINS - all types, ansi sql functions - including analytic functions, nulls, subqueries, boolean logic,etc.  It's a non-trivial set of stuff to have in your head so you can think correctly about problems.<p>To make it even more fun, you need to have a meta-sense of when to apply what tools and languages?  When do you want a RDBMS versus rolling out hadoop?  What data do you want to send to your web app so your users can muck around with it - which means understanding enough Javascript to be able to provide them with some intuitive tools to munge data there.<p>I'm pushing towards the idea of internalizing not only the specifics of a language, but the idea of what programming language and tool fits a problem best at any given time.<p>Software folks get all the best toys to think about . . .",1261500171

I don't know about other states, but Ohio's ""achievement"" tests attempt to measure minimum competency as defined by a State-wide committee.  This study's authors have implicitly decided that the proper way to measure a math education is by the percentage of students who have obtained minimum competency.  [Unless there were some other tests used which I am unaware of, of course] Most readers here likely have a very different definition of a good math education.<p>2.  Public schools have a huge incentive to optimize upon obtaining good test scores.  Because of No Child Left Behind, public schools are under the gun to obtain good test scores at nearly any cost.  At least in Ohio, it is optional for private schools to subject their students to standardized testing.  My wife and I toured the local Montessori school, and I asked one of the teachers if my son would have to take Ohio's achievement tests.  She thought I was concerned that he would not, so she began to tell me that they were optional but the curriculum would adequately prepare my son for them, etc.  When I cut her off to tell her how disgusting I found them, she started to complain about how they hurt education and clearly shared my views.<p>3.  Private schools whose purpose is superior education are lumped in with those which exist to protect youth from hearing that the earth might be more than 6000 years old.  It might very well be that academically-oriented private schools offer far superior math programs but schools that exist for religious reasons severely drag down the average.<p>>The end result, however, is students who are “prepared for the tests of 40 years ago and not the tests of today,” she said.<p>Is test preparation now considered the primary goal of education?  I am becoming less and less convinced that I want my children to participate in the machine that is the US school system.",1261499490

For example, they might look at the age and ownership in DNS records, and exclude domains that look fishy based on some heuristics.  The spammers fought back with more tricks, and the resulting arms race has come to have an acronym: SEO.

I often spend hours or even days pouring over existing code and in the end change a single line of code.

This makes building good websites cheaper, and therefore increases how much people are willing to spend to <i>advertise</i> those websites.<p>This isn't a new strategy.  In the late 90s when Oracle and IBM got into open source, this was their strategy.  Oracle wanted to get people to stop paying for Sun hardware so Oracle could negotiate higher prices.  (I know more than a few people who were surprised to find that licenses for Oracle on Linux are higher than they are on Sun.)  IBM was looking to reduce the price for complements to IBM websphere, and was looking for opportunities to avoid having customers pay the Microsoft tax.<p>If you run a company and wish to strategically open source something, you should think in the same terms.  What is the complement to what you are charging for, and how can you make that cheaper?",1261497928

Once you need to work as part of a team, time management becomes important because you have to manage the interruptions + coordination with other people who depend on each other to be productive.<p>Yes, however, time management and team coordination do add overhead.  Teams, however are much more scaleable that individuals.  In addition, they are also fault tolerant.<p>Put in hacker terms... a great programmer is an superfast solid state drive, whereas a team is a raid 6 array with a bunch of disks that are slower and of varying speeds.<p>Overall, the solid state disk might individually perform better (and possibly be cheaper), but generally most people tend to agree the RAID array is a better way to go if you can afford it.",1261497710

1010104,comment,1008990,1009550,0,0,elblanco,,,"Well, the story is a combination of typical archetypes retold with pretty pictures. That much I cannot argue about. And I think that what you are really saying by ""the plot sucked"" is ""it's too archetype driven"". I'm basing this on:<p>>I personally found the warmed over ""Stupid White Man penetrates exotic closed society and rises to be leader of it, seducing the native woman"" plot tiresome, repetitive and tedious<p>Sure the characters ranged from a bit 2-d (the Col.) to well fleshed out (Neytiri (watch it again if you don't believe me)) and the acting ranged from ""will probably win an award it was so good"" Saldana to ""thanks for showing up and picking up your paycheck"" Weaver. But that's nothing different than you'll find in almost every movie -- the principles are fleshed out and the supporting cast is flat.<p>Why can't we have more 'smart' movies like <i>Erin Brockovich/Schindler's List/Fight Club/District 9/Oldboy/etc.</i> (archetypes of David vs. Goliath, Greed and Bullies) or <i>The Incredibly True Story of Two Teenagers In Love/Léon/American Beauty/Mississippi Masala/South Pacific/Moulin Rouge/West Side Story etc.</i> (Forbidden Love) or <i>Lawrence of Arabia/Dune/Hunt for Red October/etc.</i> (Lovable Turncoat)... you ask? And I'd counter that all of those are as archetype driven as any other well known flick (archetype stories provided in parens).<p>You see where I'm going with this. Even if you don't agree with all my movie choices as being ""good"" or ""smart"" you'll at least have to agree that most movies that are at least reasonably well known are pretty much based on a dissection or aggregation of common archetypes. How many times has Romeo and Juliet been retold almost verbatim? And by and large the audience enjoys these things and says ""oh the plot was so good"" when really, they are just a rehash of old story ideas. We even group movies into archetype driven categories ""love story"", ""ghost story"", ""suspense"", etc.<p>So yes, I was being ""cute"" with my notional art-house flick. But if you want to find something not driven by archetypes, where the artists consciously try to avoid those things, you have to go there, or to France or Italy perhaps. Here, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/chart/top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/chart/top</a> this is the top 250 movies on IMDB not by dollars but by rating. How many of these are ""smart"" movies meaning ""not a rehash of archetypes""? Very few if any.<p>It's pretty simple really, if you don't want your intelligence to be insulted (meaning you don't want an archetype driven story), you end up with a movie about a vapid cowgirl/model with giant thumbs or a movie director that can't focus on making movies because he's too busy with all his mistresses (which is actually just a retelling of the ""guy with too many girlfriends archetype""). And given that non-archetype driven movies are typically poorly rated and attended by the open public, either you are particularly ""smart"" or those movies tend to suck.",1261497644

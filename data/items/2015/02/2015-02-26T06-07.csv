I recently switched from AI to Human Computer Interaction which is more cross discipline, specifically with a strong influence from psychology. I&#x27;ll gladly admit that I don&#x27;t have the best understanding of NHST but I think I understand it well enough.<p>Interestingly enough there was a post on HN somewhat recently about Bayesian alternatives (BEST). The paper that was linked was:
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/lang/CRAN/web/packages/BEST/vignettes/BEST.pdf<p>And the recommended book I settled on was by the author of that paper (Doing Bayesian Data Analysis)<p>I feel like I&#x27;m &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; thanks to HN :D",1424933908

9111430,comment,9109775,9110131,0,0,cnvogel,,,"Depending on how you might want to use the GPIO pins, this is a clear yes, or no... Traditionally, GPIO is somehow a strange beast when integrated as tightly on SOCs like the Broadcom on the Raspberrypi.<p>On one side, it&#x27;s a pretty dumb interface: You put a bit in a memory address and the output changes state. No fancy logic, everything done in software. On the other hand, it&#x27;s very tightly integrated on the CPU, so you have a very fast path to toggling them.<p>If you really need this tight integration because you want to trigger interrupts from an external source, or want to bit-bang a non-standard serial protocol, you&#x27;ll have little luck: The USB latency will make it orders of magnitude slower than &quot;native GPIO.&quot; and the better solution will be to directly hard-code parts of the logic into the external microprocessor, and speak to this special purpose hardware.<p>If you are only interested in turning on- or off a few lights, one of the popular GPIO expanders via i2c will be cheaper and probably just as slow :-).<p>But: A huge strength of this project would be if the i2c-over-usb and spi-over-usb ports get decent native support in-kernel-support in Linux, because that&#x27;s where you can get pretty decent performance with the well-defined protocols. That&#x27;s something that would fill a huge gap in available products, both for the PC and the &#x27;pi.<p>{I&#x27;ve tried to get something running on a special-purpose CH340(?) uart/i2c/spi-to-USB bridge, but unfortunately the two latter modes are severly underdocumented...}",1424933669

So the question of &quot;what is normal in US courts&quot; seems inseparable from ISDS and any other extra-national trappings of TPP/TTIP.<p>Thanks for your original answer.  I agree completely that the reported proposals seem absurd and inconsistent with precedent.  Yet, the reports of leaked documents have been consistent in their absurdity, for more than a year.

Thats why a fundamental heuristic of any startup idea you work on should be: &quot;would i be proud i worked on this problem even if i don&#x27;t get an outlier outcome?&quot; If you can&#x27;t say &#x27;yes&#x27; to that, you probably won&#x27;t have the fire to overcome the unpredictable obstacles that will fight you every inch of the way.<p>Ultimately, that means shifting from a &#x27;risk calculating&#x27; mindset to an &#x27;exposure mindset.&#x27; Instead of &#x27;what are my chances of success&#x27;, &#x27;am I cool with potentially spending years of my life on this problem regardless of outcome&#x27;?

The 5% represents the chance that <i>if the null hypothesis is true</i>, you would draw data at least as extreme as the data you just saw in a repeated experiment.<p>Computing the probability that the data came from the theory stated in the null hypothesis would require a (Baysian) prior.<p>Also, Tloewald&#x27;s reply is completely and inexorably wrong. Tloewald seems to want a Bayesian answer, which frequentist statistics can&#x27;t give you.",1424931193
9111363,comment,9109801,9111064,0,0,mdbco,,,"You&#x27;re absolutely correct that Bayesian approaches are not magical and do not suddenly supply you with vastly more information than frequentist approaches (particularly when you have a really poor prior, in which case the Bayesian approach will be similarly poor). Bayesian statistics is certainly very popular right now, but it should not be looked at as some sort of panacea for all statistical problems.<p>However, I would say that Bayesian approaches do have a big advantage in terms of helping with the interpretation problems that plague frequentist significance testing. Namely, as the OP article points out, Bayesian approaches reformulate the testing question in a way that is more intuitive, i.e. &quot;what is the probability of the hypothesis given both the prior probability and the new data?&quot;. So yes, Bayesian methods surely do not fix everything, but since interpretation of statistics is such a major concern, they can be quite beneficial.",1424931160

Given the existence of a simple standardized diet that people are willing to eat <i>exclusively</i> outside of a laboratory setting, you could pay a bunch of volunteers to eat soylent you provide which either has or hasn&#x27;t been modified to include different amounts of vitamins, different amounts of carbs or whatever.<p>> I&#x27;m not willing to prove that theory wrong using my own body.<p>Fortunately you can&#x27;t stop <i>other</i> people from experimenting in just that way. The world is full of people who eat odd restricted diets and live reasonably long, healthy lives. There&#x27;s no reason to let the best be the enemy of the good.

It&#x27;s doing something really amazing and important in the realm of architecture and construction that&#x27;s much needed.<p>It&#x27;s weather-agnostic - (certain construction work you just can&#x27;t do in winter). Bottlenecks are easily controlled: No questions about worrying about different trades (say, the structural steel work, etc) being slow and pushing all other aspects of the entire project behind. It&#x27;s more predictable, since you have very clear quantifiable markers of progress (what % of units are completely finished?) It cuts down on the costly / cumbersome process of using a hoist during construction, which is expensive and timely since you have to hire specialized labor and get a permit to close off the street.<p>To use a programming analogy, it&#x27;s effectively a kind of <i></i>parallelization or non-blocking i/o<i></i>, since you can track progress in a reliable, controlled setting, stagger your work, and have many different trades working at once, on different aspects. (Electrician behind schedule on half of the units? You can still have the plumbing crew work on the finished half while bringing more electricians on board.)<p>Present-day construction is highly linear, mostly single-threaded and filled with bottlenecks everywhere, since it&#x27;s both a logistical and financial disincentive to hire a trade to come in to do work if there&#x27;s not enough work for them to do. The contractor pads the schedule to make sure that previous work will be ready for future work. As a result, construction times are longer, less predictable, etc.<p>Granted, this isn&#x27;t totally new, but it&#x27;s really important that prefabrication is getting more visibility and is understood to be the architectural game-changer that it will be in the future.",1424931009

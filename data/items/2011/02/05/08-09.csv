For example, there is an interesting scaffolding class but the details provided are very limited. There's no compatibility list regarding what databases it works with, or how customizable the output is via the object's functions. I understand not exposing the source code of a for sale library, but there should definitely be auto-generated API docs for each class, in this way I have a better understanding rather than just a limited demo, clearly in this case $29 isn't a big deal, but it does add an unnecessary layer of doubt.",1296896206

Do you think they remain uncontacted because they do not have the means to contact? They have remained uncontacted because of their choice. They live close to nature and there is nothing wrong with that. They have their own society and their own culture. Their life is as complicated and as rich as your life is.<p>How do you measure how civilized a culture is? If it is their choice to remain un-contacted, they should be free to live that way. You cannot make an assumption that they would die young. Their bodies would have developed systems to counter most of the natural viruses and other health aspects there. Their upbringing would have taught them the skills to live in harmony with the forest. Their brains would not have developed the adequate techniques to survive in our society. Getting them out of there is the worst possible thing that you can do to them. They have got their technology and we have ours.<p>What is comfort to you is only a conditioned response? Car is a great comfort only if you want to travel long distances. They have crafted their lifestyle in such a manner that they do not need such comforts. Most of their building materials and techniques would take care of air conditioning and cooling. They consume so few resources that their carbon foot print is probably negative.<p>As far as education is concerned, we use this education to survive in this society, to earn, to create and transact with goods and so on. Their society is not built on such structures and transactions. They would have different structures and transactions. One is not necessarily superior or inferior. They are merely different.",1296896156

2182714,comment,2182423,2182423,0,0,mc32,,,"I think the question might better be, why don't Americans travel overseas?  Then compare that to how many non-Americans travel overseas.  What I'm getting at is that in a small country, you deplete exploration of your own country quickly.  In larger places like America, Australia, Canada, China, Russia, one has lots to discover at home and ""abroad"" can be very far away for many in the interior.<p>Whereas, places like Europe, Middle East, South America are made up (mostly) by relatively small countries, so going abroad could be a 5 hour drive or train ride.<p>When Europeans go south for the Summer (or Winter) they go to another country, almost necessarily; in the US or other large countries, Summer beaches or Winter slopes are in the same country, hence no need to travel outside the country.<p>I think this question of travel deserves another metric to take the distance and geographic discrepancies into account.",1296893359

Because what you're calling ""Western medicine"" happens to be practiced all over the world. I'd prefer to call it ""science-based medicine"" or ""evidence-based medicine"", although I will admit the applicability of those labels is more range-based than absolute.<p>However, you're right. Western medicine isn't the only medicine in the world. There's also voodoo-based medicine (with ""voodoo"" representing any variety of ""ancient chinese secret""-type of treatments). So which would you prefer to be treated with? ""Western"" medicine, or voodoo medicine?<p>Also, ""While we are at it lets take them our aids, diabetes, obesity etc...""<p>You do realize AIDS originated in sub-saharan Africa, right?

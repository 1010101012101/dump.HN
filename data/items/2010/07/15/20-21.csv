1519163,comment,1519002,1519002,0,0,AmberShah,,,"Don't take this the wrong way, but you sound pretty arrogant.  Why is your SAT score relevant - To prove to us that you're smart?  You want a tip: forget about it.  You're worth the value that you bring to the table right now.  That value is based on how smart you are AND your hussle.  Based on getting ""kicked out of college for not attending class"", I would say you've got no hard-work skills at all.<p>Why not find a better job, or one working a startup?  Why not go back to college?  Why not start your own business on the side while you work?  You say ""I've been wanting to do this for awhile"" but it sounds to me like you got fed up with people telling you what to do and gave up, instead of fighting for something better.<p>A business plan is worth nothing.  A drop-out with no execution skills, no prototype and no team is not going to get funding.<p>You put yourself out there with this post and exposed your fear and that's commendable.  I would say: step 1 of 100,000 in the right direction.<p>1.) Get over how smart you are.<p>I'm sure people told you how much potential you had as a kid, but that's over now.  In the adult world, potential doesn't count for shit.  The guy who got a 950 is kicking your ass right now because he got up and did something. (Just FYI, I had to do this too, it's humbling but necessary)<p>2) Go get a job NOW to pay the bills<p>Living with your parents is for kids.  At least your expenses are low so there's no reason you can't make enough money to support yourself AND build your business (assuming that's what you want to do).  Go hussle up a job that can pay your bills.  Mow lawns, wait tables, build websites, WHATEVER.  By staying on your own you're increasing your odds for success and, you know, being a grown-up.<p>3) Build something SOON<p>Bootstrap a very small niche business that can bring in $100 a month.  And do it in the next month.  There are a zillion resources out there to hold your hand through doing that.  If this is unpleasant for you or if you can't make that happen, DON'T start your own full-fledged startup or waste time looking for funding because that is a million times harder.<p>4) If you're interested in the startup scene but aren't ready to start your own, get a job with a startup.  With your history it might be that all you can get is an equity-only position.  So you work there and work on the side to support yourself.<p>5) Hussle.  Rinse.  Repeat.",1279227530

1519134,comment,1518481,1518788,0,0,trevelyan,,,"It is a fantastic book! And the setting of the film is different, but the story is surely the same: an emotionally immature protagonist gets swept up in an ever-expanding and quasi-supernatural game. The emotional crimes he plays out on others are played back on himself through this game, causing him to eventually achieve self-realization through a sort of emotional catharsis and resurrection (metaphorically in the book, quite visually in the film with the white suit and the graveyard and all).<p>Replace Greece with San Francisco and the sexual crimes in the novel with the film's emphasis on corporate greed. Still not convinced? The icing on the cake for me is the fact that both film and book end identically, hanging on a moment of choice in a situation which leaves it ambiguous if ""the Game"" is still ongoing.<p>I don't think Fincher really nailed the movie the way he did with Seven and Fight Club, but the connection to the Magus seems obvious for another reason as well: the weak points of the film start making sense if you think about it as an adaptation. The major point of the Fowles novel is in its Eliot quote that, ""the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.""  I don't think the film is as convincing as the book in part because the romantic relationship it uses to do this is incidental to its preoccupation with corporate greed and is not very believable. But the intended structure helps explain some of its weaker dramatic moments, the biggest of which for me was seeing Michael Douglas running around a corporate cafeteria with a gun shouting about the need to protect his employees and their pensions.",1279226944

1519119,comment,1518532,1518778,0,0,gxti,,,"It's a sliding scale. For example, compare to the audiophile cult<i></i>^W<i></i>community. Most people don't know what good headphones are until they put on their first pair, but then they do there is no going back to the old, muddy $10 pair from Target. But then a select few take it to ridiculous levels and spend thousands of dollars on de-oxygenated, cryo-treated ethernet cables with electron flow arrows and ceramic ground plane spacing pylons. Don't let the fact that these weirdos exist (and the businesses willing to bilk them) fool you into thinking that most people couldn't tell the difference at the low end of the scale though, where each additional dollar goes the furthest. But most people never buy any headphones other than at the low end, so they don't realize that a modest increase in price can provide a substantial gain in quality.<p>The same thing is true about coffee -- supermarket beans are cheap and stale. Starbucks is substantially more expensive (mostly because it's sold by the cup) and significantly better (mostly because of copious quantities of sugar), but still not that great. Beans fresh from a local roaster sit on a critical point where more money creates a similar increase in quality. Below that point, a dollar produces many dollars in value. Above that point, a dollar produces less than a dollar in value. Putting a three-stage reverse osmosis water filter on your $4000 double-boiler, gold-plated, hand-operated espresso machine is way off into ""pleasant waste of money"" territory.<p>As for hot water specifically: hot water does in fact change taste because A) hot water dissolves things faster (like the insides of your pipes) and B) tanks tend to concentrate and add to the impurities. See <a href=""http://everything2.com/title/Never+drink+or+cook+with+hot+tap+water"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everything2.com/title/Never+drink+or+cook+with+hot+ta...</a> for some examples. Whether your hot water has perceptible taste differences depends on your hot water heater and the piping around it. Cold water is best not because it is cold but because it has less crud in it. Of course, the cold water may need filtering too if it doesn't taste relatively neutral out of the tap, like many municipal supplies.",1279226770

The issue\n    first arose when NeXT proposed to distribute a modified GCC in two\n    parts and let the user link them.  Jobs asked me whether this was\n    lawful.  It seemed to me at the time that it was, following\n    reasoning like what you are using; but since the result was very\n    undesirable for free software, I said I would have to ask the\n    lawyer.\n    \n    What the lawyer said surprised me; he said that judges would\n    consider such schemes to be ""subterfuges"" and would be very harsh\n    toward them.  He said a judge would ask whether it is ""really"" one\n    program, rather than how it is labeled.\n</code></pre>\nLater, Linux under the direction of Linus Torvalds did the opposite\nthe other way by looking the other way when nVIDIA and others\ndistributed binary blobs that directly interfaced with the\nkernel. Some people now point to this as an example of why this sort\nof thing is just fine by the GPL, but in fact it's a very grey\narea. It's likely that if the Linux kernel had been run by the FSF\nthat nVIDIA's actions would have resulted in a lawsuit.<p>However, as pointed out by others this doesn't appear to be a case of\nusing a public GPL API at all, but rather case of code being\ncopied.

It seems many people jump straight to the best they can afford, while I find it more enjoyable to slowly work my way up, so e.g. there's no point in jumping straight to world-class wines if you can't even tell much cheaper wines apart (it's surprisingly hard to get any good at blind taste testing).<p>With coffee I think the biggest low-hanging fruit is recently ground coffee: coffee that's brewed weeks after being ground is a <i>lot</i> different than freshly ground coffee, and it's fairly noticeable I think. You don't have to jump straight to hand-roasted small-batch coffees ground in a $1000 grinder minutes before you brew it in your high-end espresso machine.<p>Another more psychological issue is just separating different things for different purposes.

I wondered how they were ever able to sleep. It turns out the coffee they made was so weak that 12 quarts of it probably had the same caffeine as 12 oz of today's intense artisanal coffees. I had severe insomnia through most of my 20s and I think it was partially due to the fact that I was emulating my grandparent's coffee intake but using ""proper"" coffee. I still keep up the coffee snob act, but now when I make coffee at home it's 4/5 decaf.",1279224373

That said, Kitchenaid makes a great burr grinder for drip or press use. Low-end burr grinders are also pretty cheap. There are of course many very expensive espresso grinders, but they are best at making an espresso grind (very fine) and may not be good at medium or coarse settings, or may not have them at all.",1279224336

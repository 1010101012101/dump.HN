Perhaps someone good at hacking and analyzing government data can help?<p>The real comparisons seem:<p>1)  If SWAT officers do regular policing too, then compare the incremental annual cost of their goodies versus the 1 year fully loaded (salary + pension + benefits + equipment) cost of a police officer.  I won&#x27;t pretend to know this answer, other than tanks seem expensive, but then again so are cops.<p>2)  If SWAT officers don&#x27;t do regular policing, or do significantly less, then you need to add that to the equation.<p>Slightly off-topic, I have to admit that seeing cops patrol the streets with machine guns is a little off-putting.

It is not conducive to good conversations.<p>> <i>Third, he mostly listed examples where a cursory bout of reasoning or just a bit more experience in computers (gotten through doing something other than delegating to the mystical IT wizards) would&#x27;ve solved the problem.</i><p>Even people who have a lot of experience with computers will often not have had occasion to mess with their proxy settings. I have managed labs and offices with dozens of computers and the number of times I&#x27;ve needed to change the proxy settings on any machine is precisely zero. And I didn&#x27;t know until pretty recently that some computers have a small, unlabeled switch that exists only to trick you into turning your Wi-Fi off on accident. That would have stumped me too, at least for a while. These are hardly fundamental failures of computer literacy.<p>> <i>And no, he didn&#x27;t say the kid was stupid or a numbskull--he said the kid didn&#x27;t know how to use computers.

A message box opens up, but the kid clicks OK so quickly that I dont have time to read the message.<p>Computer sends message to user. User quickly dismisses it without thought. This evokes mixed feelings from me.<p>First, unfortunately, we have spent a long time training users that computers output cryptic messages that they don&#x27;t need to understand. Anyone who used XP for more than 3 years is probably used to seeing odd pop-ups or error boxes from some application that&#x27;s spitting out some message (possibly too often) that the user doesn&#x27;t know. They&#x27;re used to seeing things crash, and they&#x27;re used to messages being too technical to be actionable. That is in part our (development) fault.<p>However, things are better now. If a message box pops up, you probably should read it. You should pay attention to what the computer says. I think that people so often just don&#x27;t care what it is because they guess that it won&#x27;t get in their way for their <i>immediate</i> task so they don&#x27;t want to bother. Or, worse, they&#x27;re afraid it will require some thought/energy (even if it&#x27;s small) to understand and take appropriate action, and they&#x27;re crossing their fingers and hoping that ignoring it is for the best.",1376078192

Now those are salient facts and you know it; you should not have omitted them from your original description of the situation.<p><i>What bothers me is how the police responded.</i><p>If <i>anyone</i> calls up the police saying that they&#x27;ve killed a person the police are setting out with a possibility that they&#x27;re going to be encountering an armed and dangerous individual.

6187994,comment,6187635,6187635,1,0,jetti,,,"The executive order that Obama mentioned in this speech is a bit misleading(from what I can tell). First, it doesn&#x27;t protect those individuals from being charged with a crime, it only protects their job. Here are a few thoughts on this executive order[1] which are my own thoughts though I&#x27;m not a lawyer and my interpretation could be wrong.<p>Here is the opening paragraph for Section A:<p>&quot;Any officer or employee of a Covered Agency who has  authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any Personnel Action, shall not, with respect to  such authority, take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a Personnel Action with respect to any employee serving in an Intelligence Community Element as a reprisal for a Protected Disclosure. &quot;<p>And here is what a &quot;Personnel Action&quot; is defined as:<p>&quot;The term &quot;Personnel Action means an appointment, promotion, detail, transfer, reassignment, demotion, suspension, termination, reinstatement, restoration, reemployment, or performance evaluation; a decision concerning pay, benefits, or awards; a decision concerning education or training if the education or training may reasonably be expected to lead to an appointment, reassignment, promotion, or performance evaluation; a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination; and any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.&quot;<p>Which means, Snowden couldn&#x27;t be fired, however, he could still be charged with crimes, nothing about that. But the next sentence can really invalidate all of that:<p>&quot;The term &quot;Personnel Action does not include the termination of an employee pursuant to section 1609 of title 10, United States Code.&quot;<p>There are more caveats to &quot;Personnel Action&quot; but this first one is what caught my eye. Looking up 10 USC  1609[2]:<p>&quot;(a) Termination Authority.

The worst that could happen? Maybe you mistype a flag and end up recursively deleting a directory. \nHowever at least most &quot;damage&quot; done on a computer rarely crosses into the physical realm -- anything lost or damaged can often be repaired or restored inside of a few minutes.<p>So, sure, much of &quot;computer literacy&quot; is simply following instructions that will _usually_ work -- but there&#x27;s not much hanging in the balance if you mess up.<p>Working on cars though? I would urge strong caution against simply following instructions. Even a fairly &quot;simple&quot; procedure such as jumping your car&#x27;s dead battery can end in _serious injury or death._ Many people don&#x27;t realize that their $70 car battery, such an innocuous looking box, can provide in excess of several hundred amps when the current is demanded. Shorting a battery is a quick way to create such a demand. Such a short could result in burns, electrocution, explosions [discharging lead acid batteries give off hydrogen gas], and could even result in a bit of rather annoying spot-welding.<p>Working on certain suspension components can easily create enough force to maim or dismember innocent bystanders.

I&#x27;m interested in the DA&#x27;s report (although those take a loooooong time to come out)<p>I have fundamental questions though about the rules that our public safety department is operating under. And I will get those answered.<p>One, what is the justification for driving around in an armoured vehicle? There is so much information on how what you do &quot;just before&quot; a situation can totally change the way you react in a situation, it seems unreasonable to roll into a situation like a squad of marines rolling on to the beach head.<p>Second, what is the standard used for engaging deadly force? How is that established, trained, and on what basis was it arrived at?<p>Third, what is the process for evaluating the training effectiveness and its implementation in our police force? What does it tell us about this event?<p>Fourth, in our policy what precedence to we place on safety, is it citizens first or officers first?<p>As I mention elsewhere, it was the combination of events that got me asking these questions, not just this one. So it goes from &quot;hmm, that was a sad story&quot; to &quot;hmm, is there a problem here that needs to be fixed?&quot;<p>I know how to fix problems, step one is verify that it is one. That is where I am now.<p>This bit annoys me though:<p><pre><code>  > I realize this might be the result of error\n  > rather than intention, but you should \n  > apologize to people for having only \n  > provided them with half the facts.\n</code></pre>\nGiven that I know some of the eye witnesses, and I know that the reported story wasn&#x27;t the same as the their story, I felt like the folks with &#x27;half the facts&#x27; might be people who only read it or watched it in the news. So I consider myself to be in possession of slightly <i>more</i> facts than those folks, but I make no claim as to the overall percentage. And that leads me to the second annoyance.<p>As I wrote, (and was misread), the thing that bothered me <i>wasn&#x27;t the shooting.</i> I recognize that there is no way at this stage for me to have any sort of informed opinion about the justifiabilty of that shooting. What bothers me is <i>how the police responded.</i>  And to a lesser extent the equipment they brought with them.<p>Since nobody disavowed this as some rogue event, I must conclude that they responded <i>as they were trained to do.</i> And it is <i>that</i> which has me bothered.

I didn&#x27;t observe anyone in my classes (well this was back in 1982, so memory is a challenge here) confused about that point. And, as soon as we learned it, the requirement for formalism was dropped. It was the same in algebra. In the first weeks you weren&#x27;t allowed to go directly from x + 3 = 1 to x = -2. You had to do something like x + 3 - 3 = 1 - 3; x + 0 = 1 - 3; x = 1 - 3; x = -2; with all the rules that you are using written out.

However, they&#x27;re almost never for no reason, as they&#x27;re very expensive for a supplier to do.<p>Club packaging requirements are very particular to how they sell, in large bulk packs directly off pallets or steel racks. Usually the packaging is completely custom to the club, from the product packaging itself to the pallet packing. And no club wants the same as another (if they even stock the same product). This leads to new packaging having all kinds of unforeseen problems that slip through testing; from shifting in transit when using certain trucks, pallet crushing due to stack design, stretch wrap ripping for some reason, sub-optimal presentation when the pallet is thrown on the floor for sale, etc.<p>The package refresh itself will take the supplier ~6-12 months (unless it&#x27;s a critical deficiency in the packaging), so even if the problems present themselves immediately you&#x27;re looking at a &quot;yearly&quot; overhaul. And then the cycle repeats itself, when new bugs are introduced (you just can&#x27;t test for everything that&#x27;s gonna hit at Club scale sales).<p>Standard retailers use the same basic packaging styles, even if slightly customized for that client, so most of the &#x27;gotchas&#x27; with those have been rooted out and accounted for, so refreshes are much less frequent.<p>Edit: Unless you were talking about simple label changes. In which case you are correct in there being no real reason beyond the marketing department trying to keep itself employed. Supply chain departments hate it due to the headaches and costs associated with switching over (and writing off unused labels/packaging).",1376076545

Each have their own difficulties.  And once they converge (single cell->rapid->entire organ) you will see some pretty cool stuff.<p>One major impediment is similar to the 3D printing world - we need and rapid access at single micron levels.  Right now most 3D printers get down to about 100microns.  We need better.<p>We also need creative ways to mix cell types - your organs use many (but a finite number) of cell types dispersed in an organized way.  Coming up with a clever way to use different &#x27;inks&#x27; of cells in an organized way would be extraordinarily useful.  As others have said - a primary reason is vascularization, but there are a number of cell types you&#x27;d need to worry about.<p>Definitely moving quickly though - we&#x27;ve seen pretty fast progress in lab keeping cells alive and starting to use different cell types for small structures.  We can do any given manipulation.  We now need to combine them to make the entire process fast, micron resolution, high viability, natural scaffoldings, with many cell types.<p>Futher - as this article points out, there&#x27;s a LOT we can learn simply from being able to recreate and experiment on small portions of tissues and organs properly.

His daughter was away at camp for the summer and his wife had mailed her a care package that included laundry detergent. As they later found out, detergent can be used as a masking agent for drugs.<p>A few days after the package was sent, Law Enforcement (DEA & local police, IIRC) surrounded the house. Luckily, back in the good old days, they didn&#x27;t break the door down and start shooting, at least not in Palo Alto. They knocked, were let in, and asked the CEO&#x27;s wife to open the package that the police had intercepted, upon which the laundry detergent was discovered.<p>The point I want to make about this whole category of problems, that seem to mock the 4th Amendment (NSA surveillance, civil asset forfeiture, militarization of police, etc.) is that we should be far more worried about incompetence than malice. We keep getting warned that these things are a pathway to tyranny but frankly, that may or may not happen. Horrific incompetence that ruins people&#x27;s lives is with us today, at scale, and the problems grow with the power, money and technology given to those that wield them. We now have no-recourse no-fly lists, police raids on wrong houses that kill homeowners (so often it&#x27;s no longer newsworthy), and sick elderly parents fighting for their house because their kid sold $20 worth of weed from the front porch (the latter from Sarah Stillman&#x27;s other excellent New Yorker article).<p>Back in Palo Alto, it would have taken almost zero competent police work to determine that the care package containing laundry soap, sent to a summer camp from the home of two working professionals was almost certainly not masking drugs.

Venezuela does not produce anything other than oil. So , everything we consume here is imported (food,clothing,etc). If you are in commerce and need to import something, you go to the black market.<p>And that explains why the projected inflation for this year is ~45 - 50%.<p>Argentina already suffered hyper-inflation not too long ago. I cannot understand why they did not learn from their mistakes.",1376074942

I know that feeling, how many times can someone say &quot;The Internet it down&quot; and you have told them the steps to identify what is the problem and often fix it?<p>I really applauded Microsofts work on &quot;Trouble Shooters&quot; which would walk you through those steps. Each one saying &quot;Is it better now?&quot; and if you got to the end it would send a report to Microsoft.<p>More importantly the message though is that a large number of people use &quot;computers&quot; when what they wanted were &quot;appliances.&quot; Specifically it always does what its job. No programability required. This is what makes the Chromebook and things like it so powerful for those people. Turn it on it works, if not you get a new one.<p>The dissonance of people who use a software tool, and that forces them to use a computer to run it, versus the people who use a computer that has a number of different software tools is getting stronger.",1376074876

6187632,comment,6185985,6187105,1,0,bluedino,,,">> Most jetliners are more efficient than an SUV. It&#x27;s not hard, because SUVs are so incredibly inefficient. The proper comparison is to other jetliners. The Boeing 747 gets about 100 passenger-miles per gallon. That&#x27;s 5x as efficient as the Concorde, at 20 passenger-miles per gallon.<p>The Concorde was twice as fast - which is why it was worth a premium over a 747. Just like it costs more to send a package next-day than it does grown.<p>It&#x27;s also &#x27;worth&#x27; the fuel penalty. Just like you car burns twice as much gas going 100mph as it does 65mph, but you get there faster so it could be &#x27;worth&#x27; it if you&#x27;re in an emergency, or poor planner.<p>Speaking of efficiency, what does a Greyhound Bus or Amtrak train get as far as passenger miles/gallon?",1376074823

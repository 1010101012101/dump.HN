It's about investing in transformative technologies.</i><p>I agree with you that radical innovation doesn't come from just making things more efficient/simpler/easier, and I've argued that such a mindset yields local max solutions. The example of Fabricly was only used to display how an approach that addresses the problem from the root and transforms the way an industry operates is what radical innovation is (not about social shopping). Your definition seems to confine it to cutting edge industries with cutting edge technology; however, radical innovation could be in retail/food/other age old industries as much as it could be in space/biotech. Radical innovation is ultimately about the transformative result and technology is only a means to get there.",1298577488

It gives the app a sense of persistence that doesn't exist in most desktop apps currently. I've already subconsciously switched to this style of thinking. I like my Firefox set up to restore the windows from last time.

At least not on Chrome 9.0.597 on OSX10.6.6<p>- Using cufon for the actual URL I want to copy isn't the best idea. It makes it really difficult to do a traditional ""select and copy"".<p>- There's no way to delete/edit a URL<p>- The title/description this for each URL may be a bit too much to ask.

2259424,comment,2258490,2258490,0,0,russell,,,"Color me skeptical.  The project will fail, of course, because it is too ambitious.  There are too many required new developments for it all to come together: new chip, new OS, new forms of scheduling, a lot more bookkeeping, not to mention new programming paradigms and compiler technology.  I would not be surprised that bookkeeping and bandwidth would eat up 90% of the processing cycles. (Obviously, I'm pulling this out of my nether end.)<p>It feels to me that is the next iteration of refinements of technology that is 40 - 50 years old.  Caches are what, from 1970?  Interconnect issues date from the same time.  I think machine cycles are in abundance, the scarce resource is interconnections for data flow.  So one of the first things you want to do is organize your data flow so that processing is local.  Think simulations like vision processing, weather prediction, rendering, where a processor can work locally and pass on a reduced amount information to its neighbors.  The interesting problems arise when the results have to be delivered non-locally.  If you store them in main memory for the recipient to pick them up, you run into bandwidth problems.<p>So what I see as needed is gazillions of low level worker bees with modest bandwidth requirements that have semi-permanent connections to the consumers of their output.  Think the human brain, Google search, image rendering.<p>Apologies for the rambling, lack of citations, etc. etc,  but I am interested in HNer's views on these issues.",1298575601

Versions, AirDrop, etc are tacked on at the end and given much less focus.<p>The problem with making my laptop work like an iPad is that the laptop is a general purpose computer and the iPad is not.[1]  The genius of the iPad was that it was a specialized device built for a single purpose: consuming media anywhere, anytime.  It has long battery life, sunlight-visible screen, and does not require mouse or keyboard.  It is very good at its purpose -- you can use it as a book reader or movie viewer while riding a bus, sitting in a park, etc -- and it sucks for anything else (e.g. anything that requires typing more than a few characters).<p>My laptop, on the other hand, was designed to be an all-up computer that could be used anywhere that there was a flat surface, but mostly indoors.  I can use it at home, at the coffee shop, etc.  It's also fine for consuming media as long as I'm not in direct sunlight or away from power for more than a few hours.<p>So.  What exactly am I gaining by adding these iPad features?  Sure, I bet they're handy and I'll probably learn to use them.

2259359,comment,2258490,2259107,0,0,inoop,,,"The problem with C is that it's not memory safe. Therefore you need hardware hacks (MMU) to separate processes. If you use a memory safe language you lose the ability to do pointer arithmetic (and the speed hacks that come with it), but you don't need to remap the page table every time you switch between processes. This makes threads and processes pretty much the same thing. Code injection is impossible in a memory-safe language, which helps with security (I'm talking about buffer overflows here, not SQL injecion, XSS etc).<p>Using a higher-level language can also help with many other things, for example integrated garbage collection, built-in serialization and process migration, intelligent message passing (pass objects around rather than bytes), etc.<p>A good example of an implementation of these ideas is Singularity (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/</a>), which is written in a superset of C#.",1298574669

No-name blogger will not give you any exposure (however, I should say that any mention/link helps) - but you need to find the right balance to get maximum realistic bang for your efforts.\n- Some strategies to monetize. If product/service based monetization - what are some of the important things that need to be done? Ditto with advertising based model.\n- Despite the amount of time you've put into development, you will need to listen. Do you have proper feedback channels in place?

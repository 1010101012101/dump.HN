I feel it's a useful distinction to make. As an example, I would say that some years ago John Dvorak jumped the shark when he turned his public personal into a troll. As a counter-example, Joel Spolsky didn't jump the shark: He woke up one day and decided that his blog had run its course.<p>I hope we are able to save some of its distinct meaning until some other phrase comes along with a similar usage.",1275659770

Mathematical performance on standardized testing is quite similar (<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/321/5888/494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/321/5888/494</a>). When people read that study many are quick to point out that there is greater variance for men than for women, however other studies suggest (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801</a>) that could certainly be attributed to cultural factors. Just read the abstract:<p>""Using contemporary data from the U.S. and other nations, we address 3 questions: Do gender differences in mathematics performance exist in the general population? Do gender differences exist among the mathematically talented? Do females exist who possess profound mathematical talent? In regard to the first question, contemporary data indicate that girls in the U.S. have reached parity with boys in mathematics performance, a pattern that is found in some other nations as well. Focusing on the second question, studies find more males than females scoring above the 95th or 99th percentile, but this gender gap has significantly narrowed over time in the U.S. and is not found among some ethnic groups and in some nations. Furthermore, data from several studies indicate that greater male variability with respect to mathematics is not ubiquitous. Rather, its presence correlates with several measures of gender inequality. Thus, it is largely an artifact of changeable sociocultural factors, not immutable, innate biological differences between the sexes. Responding to the third question, we document the existence of females who possess profound mathematical talent. Finally, we review mounting evidence that both the magnitude of mean math gender differences and the frequency of identification of gifted and profoundly gifted females significantly correlate with sociocultural factors, including measures of gender equality across nations.""<p>Let's be clear here though. There are indeed be biological differences between the male and female brain. Females may be better at certain tasks than males and vice-versa. The question is, is there evidence to suggest biological factors could play a significant role in explaining the extremely low amounts of women in science? Consider the fact that even if some biological difference in mathematical ability could be demonstrated, that wouldn't even come close to explaining the disparity. We're not trying to produce Nobel Laureates here, just scientists.",1275659387

If they get into any level of detail, it all falls down.<p>Imagine: ""well, the code is like this - open brackets defn whatever open brackets map open brackets list open brackets whatever clsoed bracket closed bracket"" (for Lisp) or ""well, we created a class with a method called foo that iterates through the 'bar' argument, and returns a array of strings"" (for Python/Java etc.)<p>I tried listening to a podcast like that (about Python IIRC) when I was on the Eurostar train once. I did have my computer with me, but I just couldn't follow it without being able to see the code. At the point I realised this, I was deep under the English Channel, so couldn't exactly log on to the blog and see the code samples...<p>The closest things I've found are either things like RailsEnvy - now reborn as The Ruby Show and not IMHO as good - which provided some useful news each week about new libraries and plugins for Rails. Or there's some higher level best practices, software engineering type programmes which often seem to be people preaching to me about how I need to be more and more test-infected and agile and (insert methodology buzzword of the week).<p>It's actually quite difficult to find good, geeky/programming-related podcasts that don't either just descend into general news chit-chat or end up with someone trying to sell me a new engineering methodology.

And regardless of the movement, there will always be people who go too far.<p>The truth of the matter is that people have a hard time accepting the fact that males need a support/advocacy group too. Many people in today's society assume that being white, heterosexual, and male equates to not having any of your rights violated. This too is far from the truth. There are serious injustices and double standards that affect and destroy the lives of many men. Their rights should be defended just as much as those of women. And both efforts should be considered honorable and not shameful.<p>Men and women are different, we can't expect both sexes to be equal in every single regard. However, we can - and should - expect both sexes to have the same rights under the law. And there is nothing wrong with advocating that.<p>DISCLAIMER: I'm not part of the feminist or the Men's Rights movement; I simply consider myself in favor of equal rights. I support the right of both groups to exist, while not agreeing 100% with either of them.<p></rant>",1275656799

1404159,story,,,9,10,wo,"Ask HN: It's Time. Need a developer/team. San Francisco or Boulder?  ",,"Hello HN,<p>A little background: I'm 32, live in Dallas, and have 'startup' running through my veins.  Most of you are in my same boat - we have ideas all-day, every-day, but somehow find an excuse not to pursue them.  I know, I know.  Ideas don't mean sh<i>t - it's the execution.  Well, I can't live with myself if THOSE people keep JUMPING and finding their wings on the way down.  It's OUR time.  It's MY time.<p>Sure, there are brilliant entrepreneurs with brilliant ideas.  Let them be.  Most companies that survive (and thrive) have iterated, pivoted, changed markets, etc.<p>So, I HAVE AN IDEA.  Not a reinvent-the-world brilliant idea, but a workable one.  One that would be cool to build, market & spend 90 hours/week working on.  One that I spend every minute obsessing about, talking about, ideating on, wireframing...<p>My dilemma:  I am not a developer.  I know enough to not get screwed.  I know what the first iteration looks like.  I don't want to outsource - I want people who are obsessed about this idea as I am.  Dallas has plenty of talent, but I want/need to be in an environment where ideas are flowing. Where people understand the game. Where smart people will tell me when my idea sucks.  You get my drift.<p>I have all the typical bullsh</i>t credentials - MBA, Sales/Trading background with 2 'obliviated' Investment Banks.  Experience with Digital Strategy, Consulting and Marketing.<p>So, San Francisco or Boulder?  Thoughts, ideas, people to talk to???<p>P.S. If you are a developer or know of one who LOVES building algorithms, aggregators and believes there is ALWAYS A BETTER WAY, please let me know.\nP.P.S.  I am not opposed to working virtually with my team.<p>And yes, I do have MONEY to get this off the ground...<p>Best,\nWoodward",1275656691

Unfortunately, unless you have some kind of weird memory talent, you probably forget most of what you hear and read.  If you really want to remember something, you have to study it at more than one sitting.  Your commute is perfect for that.  While you drive to work, you can talk to yourself about whatever you learned last night, as if you were talking to a different person. Recite foreign language vocab lists, practice your grammar, summarize the last section of the book you're reading, or think of ways to learn the new Unix command you just learned.<p>Unfortunately, I only have a fifteen minute commute, so I can't personally vouch for what it's like to do this every day, but I've done it a few times when driving to other cities, and it seemed to help a lot.",1275656679

Many of my female friends are engineers (comp, ee, cheg) and look excellent. Not because they ""dress to the nines"" but because they put on a little makeup and a nice shirt.

A thousand words that add up to ""I can't really put my finger on it or name any specifics, but Daring Fireball seems more uncritically approving of Apple lately"" is fine for pub conversation, but it's not much use as reasoned argument. How could Gruber respond to this?<p>The only specific point of Gruber's that the author cites is ""iPhone critics have seldom let facts get in their way."" I'm sure there's something to criticize in that statement, but it's a pretty slender reed on which to hang a blanket condemnation of dozens of articles.",1275656599

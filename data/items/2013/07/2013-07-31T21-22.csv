I don&#x27;t know a single person making that claim.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you have to make that claim explicitly to believe it or act on it at some level.<p>For example, how many times have you ever thought about calling a person, then decided it wasn&#x27;t really that important so you just facebook/text/email/tweet them instead? Eventually, I would think you stop having that debate altogether and short-circuit the process to just messaging them through some asynchronous medium directly. Nobody would ever argue that it&#x27;s the same thing, but the habit forms and inertia builds until eventually one method of communication has effectively supplanted the other. It would be so gradual you probably wouldn&#x27;t notice such a paradigm shift in your life until you explicitly thought about it (possibly after seeing some of its after-effects). I could see that happening...",1375307958

Don&#x27;t let some asshole like me tell you &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong!&quot;<p>I hear you on the frustrating process breakdown during the learning curve. However, if you want to learn it I promise that it&#x27;s much quicker to go the painful route and just dive in. Start off with just the basics, then every time something feels repetitive, go look it up. When you go to look something up, start with the internal help system, then move on to Google. Do &quot;:help help&quot; to learn how to use the help system.<p>For me it took about a day before I wasn&#x27;t stopping every 5-10 minutes to look something up, a week before I wasn&#x27;t stopping every hour, and I still run into stuff every couple of days where I say to myself &quot;okay, this is too repetitive, what&#x27;s the magic vim way?&quot;<p>Something that also helped me - if you want to be fast, remember that the slowest thing you can do is read. So in terms of movements, it&#x27;s bad to just keep tapping &#x27;j/k&#x27; until you see what you want. That&#x27;s like the O(n) approach. Then there&#x27;s search with an incomplete key. That&#x27;s like O(logN). But then there&#x27;s search with a good key that you know will hit what you want first try - that&#x27;s O(1). Then there&#x27;s the command-t plugin and/or the :vim command...<p>Also, either get used to using ctrl-c instead of ESC, or remap your capslock key to ESC. I prefer the latter. Not sure how to do it on Windows, but on Linux see xmodmap, and on OS X see PCKeyboardHack.<p>Syntax highlighting/indenting: add the following to ~/.vimrc<p><pre><code>  filetype on
  filetype plugin on
  filetype indent on

  syntax on
</code></pre>
Tabs - see :help tabpage.txt, though I prefer windows (see below).<p>Completion&#x27;s a bit weird in vim, but for starters there&#x27;s always ctrl-n/ctrl-p in edit mode. For more advanced stuff, see Omni completion: <a href=""http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip1591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip1591</a><p>For side-by-side split views, check out :help windows. Ctrl-w, n creates a new horizontally-split window; Ctrl-w, v creates a new vertically split window; Ctrl-w, c closes the current window; Ctrl-w, j/k/h/l switches to the next window up/down/left/right; Ctrl-w, J/K/H/L moves window to the extreme.<p>As a cheat, I&#x27;ve got the following in my .vimrc for nice split screen (window) buffers that automagically resize based on which one is currently in focus (taken from destroy all software):<p><pre><code>  set winwidth=84
  &quot; We have to have a winheight bigger than we want to set winminheight. But if
  &quot; we set winheight to be huge before winminheight, the winminheight set will
  &quot; fail.
  set winheight=5
  set winminheight=5

If anyone here is interested in telepsychotherapy (therapy using any form of digital communication), I&#x27;m currently looking for a talented dev/designer to join me as cofounder. It&#x27;s an exciting time for my field, and I think with the right mix of innovation and professional standards, the mental health world will soon see a revolution in the types of services we offer and the populations we treat.<p>The Birgit et al. article is just one of a growing number of studies that supports the efficacy of telepsychotherapy. It&#x27;s true that --as some commentators have mentioned-- the study has limitations. That can be said about a vast majority of RCTs and other clinical-science studies. But we can expect to see more and more of this research in the coming years. A number of professional mental health organizations have recently formed task forces and developed guidelines for ehealth practitioners, and those in the legal realm are working on reducing regulatory/statutory barriers to telemedicine.<p>There are, of course, certain limits to telepsychotherapy. For example, it&#x27;s not a replacement for in-person treatment of individuals with severe mental illness (e.g., suicidal tendencies). However, it carries a world of potential, both for developing new multimodal services and for reaching persons who would not otherwise receive services. Medicare already reimburses teletherapy for persons in rural areas.<p>I can be reached at cerark@gmail.com - would be happy to hear from anyone who is interested in discussing further.",1375307767

  attacks.

  But the data-sifting effort didnt disappear. The National 
  Security Agency, once confined to foreign surveillance, 
  has been building essentially the same system.
</code></pre>
Spitzer was what the data-mining experts at the NSA call a PEPa politically exposed person. Banks now monitor PEPs money wiring activities figuring they are classic targets of blackmail or bribery. Spitzer got caught in the data mining screen. I know people will probably say that even Mukasey had to sign off on an investigation as explosive as this. Spitzer was a self-detructive idiot, but at the end of the day, we have to realize that nobody has any privacy anymore.&quot;",1375306815

O&#x27;Rourke in Parliament of Whores, concerning Ken Starr&#x27;s written position on a flag-desecration law:<p><pre><code>    Congress had &quot;acted narrowly.&quot; (That is, the law is very specific, and you
    can&#x27;t be arrested for having a smart look on your face near the flag or
    anything like thatwhich is good because being specific is the essence of
    lawmaking and the whole difference between having a congress and having a
    mom.)
</code></pre>
The point here is that specificity is good so that J. Random Citizen can easily know if they are breaking the law or not.<p>But this is the reason that we have the ability to have the law interpreted on a case-by-case basis, which is different from interpreting &quot;laws&quot;, the specific as-written instances. Note that the Supreme court doesn&#x27;t hear or decide on a law randomly, only when someone brings a specific case to them.<p>The law should be written as &quot;it&#x27;s a crime to kill someone&quot; (although, that may be too specific, and a more appropriate wording may be &quot;it&#x27;s a crime to rob someone of their life and livelihood&quot;), and it&#x27;s up to the executive and judicial branches to decide (or aid in deciding in the case of the executive) what the punishment should be.  This is the defendant&#x27;s &quot;day in court&quot;, as it were.<p>I think too many people do treat the law as absolute in wording, rather than absolute in spirit.  A law that enforces something unjustly on the defendant is just as bad as a law that doesn&#x27;t justly enforce the plaintiff&#x27;s rights.  Finding that appropriate middle ground is the basis for the grey area that is the interpretation of law.<p>IANAL.",1375306757

At the same time, I do conceed that the NSA is acting in good faith and within the law as presented to them via the Patriot Act. I have similar feeling about the value of TSA, but whereas the TSA is a publicly disclosed program, my most pressing concern with the NSA is the secrecy of it. First, the secrecy presents an extremely high degree of risk (in terms of both the probabilty of occurance as well as the dangers) of mission creep. I doubt Congressional nor FISC oversight are adequate to mitigate this risk. Second, secrecy is not really a valid tool for deterence. Anti-terrorism programs are like a doomsday devices: its a good deterence only if it is widely known about (see Dr Strangelove). Moreover, while secret programs might be good for support of kill/capture programs, it is far from clear that such efforts reduce terrorism.<p>For all I know, the government spy/drone program is to terrorists as a hammer is to an ant colony. If you have a spilled pot of honey in the kitchen, it doesnt matter how good you are at spotting and smashing ants. I want to know these things, so that I can help shape public policy through the ballot box.&quot;

This divergence starts as soon as abstraction enters the picture - for example the widespread tendency to see rights as &quot;primitives&quot; that are acceded when forming higher-level emergent structures. Participation in the higher-level structure becomes de facto mandatory, and those purported rights end up nowhere to be seen.

For instance, Excel is used for a lot of business analysis. Business analysis, you say? How is 65535 rows sufficient? Excel, for instance has an engine that can process large amounts of data that&#x27;s hosted externally using a vertical columnar compression.

[3]<p>Programming is very focused on symbolic reasoning right now, so it makes sense for him to focus on visual and interactive representations and interactive models often are intertwined with visual representation. His focus on a balanced approach to programming seems like a constant harping on visualization because of this. I think he is trying to get the feedback loop between creator and creation as tight as possible and using all available means to represent that system.<p>The prototypes I have seen of his that are direct programming tend not to look like LabView, instead they are augmented IDEs that have visual representations of processing that are linked to the symbolic representations that were used to create them. [4] This way you can manipulate the output and see how the system changes, see how the linkages in the system relate, and change the symbols to get different output. it is a tool for making systems represented by symbols but interacting with the system can come through a visual or symbolic representation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=12m51s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=12m51s</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=16m55s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=16m55s</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=25m0s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/67076984#t=25m0s</a>",1375305521

6136837,comment,6133349,6133613,5,0,vabmit,,,"I think so. Yes. IIRC, the first time I saw this leaked was a combo leak by a Navy Seal and a member of the Executive. The Seal leaked that they <i>powered down</i> Bin Laden&#x27;s computers to take his hard drives after they shot him. The Executive member said that the drives were encrypted and it would take a few days to get the data. Jihadis are known to use a custom version of PGP with 2048bit RSA keys. They either used that, a COTS drive encryption program (unlikely), or reviewed and adapted an open source drive encryption program. In either of the likely scenarios they would have been using 2048bit RSA. Therefor, it is highly likely (due to the NSA having target motivation even if the drives weren&#x27;t well encrypted) that the smooth barrier does not exist and the NSA can factor 2048bit RSA in a hours to days scale time frame.<p>Also, it was leaked that NSA TAO had a 70%+ success rate compromising Chinese systems. Even with the tech companies giving them secret zero days for an extended period of time, anyone that has been a blackhat knows they&#x27;re not getting to a 70% success rate through exploits. Therefor, it&#x27;s highly likely they can decrypt VPN/SSH (TLS) traffic encrypted with AES256/RC4-128/3DES and/or the RSA/EC public cryptography used.

The penultimate axle is geared at 7089:1 with respect to the first axle.<p>Now while that implies a rotation of one degree of the first axle is accompanied by a rotation of the penultimate axle through 20 or so revolutions, in practice that&#x27;s not going to happen, because of that ton of friction you pointed out. The friction force acting to stop the last axle turning gets fed back as resistance to your pushing the first wheel, and it gets multiplied back up through the gearchain by the same factor - so the resistance to your turning the first wheel is 7000-times the resistance of turning the last wheel - plus 2000 times the resistance of turning the wheel before it, plus 918 times the resistance of the wheel before that... in total, assuming all friction forces are equal, you&#x27;re fighting against a force 12000 times the force you need to turn just one gear - just to beat the friction. Okay, so you posit some frictionless maglev bearings in a vacuum, perhaps. But you still want to get these wheels into motion, so then the same multiplier gets applied to the force you need to accelerate the mass of each gear into (rotational) motion in the first place. Getting all those gears spinning requires 12000-times the acceleration to get one of them turning, so 12000 times the force.<p>And forget about putting a useful load on the end axle - let&#x27;s put this thing in a car, say, and use it to drive the rear axle. We&#x27;ll lift up the rear axle and get the engine up to 5000 RPM. Your engine is going to get that axle spinning 7,000 times for every engine RPM - 35 MILLION revs per minute! But when you drop your 1-ton car to get some traction, the engine&#x27;s going to act like the car weighed 7000 tons...<p>You could also think of it in terms of energy. If that last gear spins at thousands of RPM, its got a huge amount of kinetic energy from somewhere. It must have come from your &#x27;tiniest push&#x27;. Your tiny push has to transfer all that energy - so it can&#x27;t be that tiny.<p>tl;dr: no.",1375304743

But in reality, my schedule is usually so chaotic, that I&#x27;d probably never actually wind up filling in a time that I was available.  I think I just prefer browsing a list of meetings that somebody else has scheduled (or proposed) and then deciding (as late as the last minute) if I want to go or not.<p>In practice, doing that for Meetup.com meetups is how I &quot;solve&quot; this problem.<p>Still though, this sounds like it might have some potential.

2931089,comment,2930826,2930826,1,0,trussi,,,"This is based on a love of b2b saas products that focus on increasing productivity...<p>First, ditch consumer.  They don't pay and are very fickle.  Lots of lookie-loos.  And it's really hard to actually solve a problem for them because they don't even know it's a problem.<p>B2B is way more lucrative.  Getting a SMB to pay $100-500/mo for a product that adds value is easy.  Try getting that amount from a consumer!<p>On the site UI: design, colors are good.  Make the tabs animated so it scrolls through the features.<p>On the content: you are stuck where I (and most other techies) get stuck.  You are focusing on features.  You have to focus on the benefits.  Answer the question: what's in it for me.<p>I see there's a bunch of features.  Strip all of it down to 2-3 things.  That's it.  You have to focus everything into 2-3 key things.  And you have to present them as benefits to the customer.  For example, 'distribute to social media' is a definitely a feature.  'Share your pictures with all your friends in one click' is a benefit (I think).<p>Think of it like this: a feature requires the customer to connect the dots to answer the question of 'what's in it for me'.  a benefit connects the dots for them.  It's like the ""because..."" of a sentence.<p>On the product: my goal with all my b2b work is to try to simplify the process until it takes zero clicks to perform it (i.e. fully automated).  if something takes 3 clicks, figure out how to get it to 2 clicks.  If it takes 2, get it to 1.  And if you can get 1 click down to zero clicks, you have reached productivity nirvana! :)<p>Second, you have to pick a really specific niche in SMB to go after. DO NOT BUILD A ONE-SIZE FITS ALL PRODUCT! You will fail.<p>Pick Info Management for dog groomers or Info Mgmt for funeral homes.  Go very specific and build a product that is custom-tailored to that niche.  This reduces competition, decreases customer acquisition cost and will get you delighted customers.<p>Once you pick your niche, you have to fully understand that customer and their processes.  This is impossible for you to do unless you were a dog groomer in a previous life, so you'll have to find some subject matter experts (SMEs) and pick their brains.<p>Then, pick the part of their process that is the most painful for them, that technology can help fix and that they will pay money for.  Solve that problem and you make money.<p>You might get lucky and your existing product will cover some of what's needed to solve that problem, but it might not.  You'll probably want to identify SMB niches that you think might have a problem related to info management as your starting point.<p>The biggest thing you want to be aware of is that when you are talking to SMEs, keep a wide open mind and ask all sorts of questions.  Don't try to force your product or your presumption of what their problems are.  You will most certainly be wrong.<p>Good luck and keep us posted on your progress!",1314431941

Sure, there's an inevitable variation in teaching quality between individuals, but the way the system works is that a set curriculum is delivered, and assessed, by teachers. 'Creativity' and 'innovation' has to be quashed to fit within these constraints. This is the cause of much frustration amongst teachers who entered the profession to 'make a difference'. (And this last sentence is very understated.)<p>Education is a factory: it processes young people through an assembly-line of set ideas and knowledge, much 'political correctness', and 'dynamic range compression' (an analogy to audio processing) of the highest and lowest intellects - culminating in an individual suitable to place in a working society.<p>Please don't blame teachers.",1314431871

It's not like these are particularly deep subjects either, people directly interact with 2 of the 3 every day.  They're not buried details, they're frontline human-computer interfaces.<p>P.S.  Understanding cars is very similar to understanding computers.  There are numerous layers of abstraction in place that allow us to rope off areas of understanding for later.  I would argue that there is actually more information to learn about cars than there is computers for a few reasons: 1) cars are <i>jam packed</i> full of computers these days.  2) there are half a dozen engineering and science disciplines involved in cars off the top of my head, and that number is only limited by the number I know the name of.  3) (depending on if we're pulling in computing hardware into the discussion or not..) cars are things built in the real world with imperfect knowledge of all the systems that go into them.  You can be sure people a century ago were not paying a ton of attention to fluid dynamics in engine cylinders.  You can always dig deeper into what is actually going on.<p>My point is here is that <i>if</i> computers are more complicated than cars, it's not by <i>much</i>.

Did Apple start the trend, and was it different before that? I am not sure, I could not find enough conclusive pictures of older models.<p>More broadly, this is the kind of rationalizing which probably come from some irrational hate that the grandparent is talking about.<p>Also to talk about advertising, it generally works that way. Not just in the first world, but in the third world too.<p>Let me give you an anecdote. tl;dr: ads targeted towards working class in India had the decor which is not even common among wealthy, it works.<p>I grew up in India, in a rather wealthy family in a medium-sized city. And I mention that, because with it comes with something which is very uncommon in most of the Western world and even bigger Indian cities. I had an entourage as a kid, the kind that only old money has in US, with a pretty minute fraction of wealth. And I was close with some of my help, been to their homes, parties etc. (May sound weird, but is not that common in that part of the world.) And most ads which specifically target them, project a lifestyle which I have generally not seen even among the wealthy i.e. people who they work for. And yet, instead of shying away from those products and considering them elitist, they embraced them, as opposed to the things that used more down to earth marketing. I have not watched Indian TV for almost a decade, but I doubt that things have changed a lot.<p>So what's wrong with Apple projecting a slightly more stylish and affluent image. Benz does that too, and so do most startup videos I have seen, irrespective of whether they were made by Adam Lisagor.<p>Errata: On second thoughts, I am not sure if it was true for the ThinkPad.

2931033,comment,2930102,2930102,2,0,URSpider94,,,"Folks seem to be mentally linking this news to Warren Buffett's comments about income tax disparity.  Keep in mind that RSU's are taxed as earned income, valued on the day that they vest.  Any appreciation above and beyond that would indeed be taxed at capital gains rates (15% if held longer than a year after vesting), but the core value will be taxed at his marginal rate of 35%.<p>Buffett's tax rate hovers around 15%, because the lion's share of his income comes from cap gains and qualified dividends.  Cook will be paying more than double that on his income from this deal.",1314428941

2931026,comment,2930842,2930842,2,0,buro9,,,"A few simple thoughts about QR codes.<p>NFC fails on some advertising... advertising on a metro system? Your advert is likely to be the other side of some high voltage train tracks, no-one could scan the NFC, but people can still scan a QR code from that distance.<p>For transactions printed QR codes are a poor choice. A lot of the time transactions want to prove that you are there performing the transaction. As an example, think of payments and cardholder-not-present... the magnetic stripe and the chip on a debit card both hold more information (just a few extra bytes) than the 16-digit number printed on a card. It is possible to prove the debit card (and implicitly 'you') were there.<p>With QR codes someone is able to take a photo of a QR code and then scan it again else where. It's very hard to prove you were there for the sake of a transaction. Ignoring payments, think FourSquare check-ins that are tied to promotions where check-ins are done via QR scanning at a caf, you're giving away a deal based on something you cannot prove and is open to fraud.<p>QR codes do help with transactions that don't require security, and with storing a fair amount of info in a dense area. Think vcards stored in a QR code on badges in a conference, or a bicycle with security QR stickers declaring ownership located in places where a bike mechanic would find them (under innertube on wheel rim, inside handlebars)... the ubiquity of QR readers (pretty much all smart phones) makes them ideal for communicating a small chunk of data to anyone and not requiring specialist equipment to read that data.<p>Where QR codes have weaknesses are related to storage of hidden data, and different values per instance of a code. Financial transactions depend on this to prove cardholder is present, and stock management depends on this to accurately count stock.<p>QR codes have their place (advertising, conference badges, tagging things, small chunks of dense data), and NFC has it's place (transactions, stock management). Sometimes these use cases overlap (conference badges) but mostly they do not.",1314428487

Another colleague (male) is having a baby on the 27th this month, he'll do exactly the same.<p>I hardly work more than 40 hours a week (sometimes I get a call on Sunday to fix an important issue or something, but not regularly). I don't trade work hours (even if it includes pay) for time spent with my kid. I just don't. And you know what? I'm not shunned for it by my boss.

Make small compact services (SOA) which you know you can build out quickly. RoR is for people who want to spend a lot of time learning the framework. At this point, it's so large you will probably never even feel like you can encompass it's full size. Kinda like django. Don't ditch php because people say it doesn't scale. YouPorn.com thought it scaled quite well. They get a crap load of traffic to boot.",1342691987

4265253,comment,4262098,4263800,2,0,neya,,,">Show me a non Apple laptop...blah blah blah<p>I have a Sony Vaio VGN FZ-21S. Its almost three and a half years old. When I bought it, it was the price of a Mac book pro. It had more performance, speed, features than a Mac book pro back then, including a Blu-Ray drive. It has survived huge amounts of mis-handling. I've dropped it into places where no one would even imagine - Sea (saline water), Rain water puddles, etc. and it still works fine.<p>I'm a film maker. I use it for heavy rendering, sometimes it is turned on without even a restart for several weeks or even months. It came with a defective GPU chipset and the entire motherboard was replaced free of cost even after its warranty period.<p>My friend has an Apple Mac book pro. I borrowed it once to do some comparisons. I will put up a blog post on this soon, but here's what you need to know:<p>1) ALL 2011 Apple Mac's have a shitty display contrast, compared to what this particular Sony Vaio gives you. The color and the contrast is beautiful on a Sony. Period. FYI - I'm a graphic/Web designer too, and this is really important for my work.<p>2) Apple charges you for anything that is not under warranty. But in my case (and millions of other Sony owners') Sony didn't charge us a single penny.<p>3) I compose music too. My Sony has an inbuilt ASIO chipset. The sound quality from this chipset is nothing like what you've heard before (assuming you've owned only Apple products). Its amazing. I compared it with the MB pro. Shit it was. Just like their iPods (If you argue the iPod has a better sound quality, then please stop reading right here. I don't want to argue with you anymore)<p>4) The MB pro heats like hell. I can't render something for more than 6-7 hours. BS. I might as well use it to fry an omlet.<p>Its ok to like Apple and its not my problem if you like Apple or not. But don't manipulate facts to suit your argument.<p>Because, this statement:<p>>Show me a non Apple laptop that I can pick up and will feel as solid and sleek as my 2011 MacBook Pro<p>is not accurate, heavily manipulated and is utter bullshit. It clearly indicates how biased you are and how ignorant you are about the pace at which the rest of the non-apple gadgets improve, day-by-day, which is atleast thrice as fast as how Apple's gadgets improve.<p>To answer your original question -\n>Show me a non Apple laptop that I can pick up and will feel as solid and sleek as my 2011 MacBook Pro<p>Please check out the Laptop sections of Sony, Toshiba, Dell,  Asus, Fujitsu, Lenovo and HP from their corresponding websites.<p>Have a nice day.",1342691507

I don't believe that Oracle removed the license limitation on purpose, but rather to make ATG consistent with their other products which you can download, install and develop with, but as soon as you use them for production you have to pay.<p>You also have to factor in that ATG's old licensing department was chronically incapable of delivering the correct license files: they used to send out production licences for the wrong IP addresses, session limitations or bad expiration dates, and it wasn't uncommon to have 3 or 4 runarounds with them in order to have what you paid for.<p>That said, I'm not looking forward to use Oracle Linux in any of our production servers, unless my clients specifically asks for it and pays for the support.

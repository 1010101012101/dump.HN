(For instance, remember those media blurbs about lots of porn being found in the raid on bin Laden?) As such I&#x27;d bet they have infrastructure in place to detect such communications.<p>But in the same half-joking vein, some other problems:<p>1. I recall reading that such stegonagraphically watermarked videos were pretty easy to detect using simple statistical analysis of the noise in the frames. With dedicated hardware for multimedia decoding cheaply and ubiquitously available, frames can be efficiently extracted and the additional number of bytes does little to slow them down. If the hidden data is encrypted, well, you could just do that without the porn.<p>2. Unless you make it as easy as tapping a key to start communicating, it still does not remove a main barrier to widespread adoption of encryption, which is inconvenience.<p>3. The problem with porn is, people will just end up paying more attention to the medium rather than the message.",1375527338

The iPhone 5 costs $849 for the 64GB model. That&#x27;s half the memory, and more expensive than the Ubuntu edge even at these higher price tiers. Unfortunately most people will probably compare the subsidised price from a carrier instead, or cheaper hardware.<p>Just because they could sell more doesn&#x27;t mean it would initially be cheaper for them - there might be constraints imposed by their choice of supplier, who can only handle a certain volume of a new experimental device for the deadline. There are a lot of setup costs involved, and the greater the volume they sell, the greater the risk - many kickstarter projects have run into this issue - what is easy to do for a run of 10,000 just won&#x27;t work for a run of 1,000,000, and if they had problems in their first batch, it could lead to serious damage to their brand if they have a huge userbase angry and waiting for hardware. So plenty of reasons for wanting to constrain supply.<p>So from Ubuntu&#x27;s point of view, perhaps keeping the production run small was a requirement - that would explain the higher price tiers, because that imposes a higher average cost on them per device. They&#x27;re probably making a loss on a $600 sale given this is a new device and the specs. Without knowing the demand curve in advance it must be quite hard to judge, but if nothing else I guess this campaign will give them a very good idea of the demand curve for a phone like this, so they will at least get that out of it if it fails.",1375525255

Aren&#x27;t phone calls supposed to be private? She interviewed Tim Clemente, a former FBI counter-terrorism agent on May 1, asking:&quot;<p><pre><code>  Is there any way  they [the federal investigators] can
  try to get the phone companies to give that up  Its not
  a voice mail. It&#x27;s just a conversation. Theres no way
  they can actually find out what [was said on the call],
  right, unless she tells them?

  Clemente:  There is a way. We certainly have ways in
  national security investigations to find out exactly what
  was said in that conversation. It&#x27;s not necessarily
  something that the FBI is going to want to present in
  court, but it may help lead the investigation  we 
  certainly can find that out.

  Burnett: So they can actually get that?  that is

  Clemente: Welcome to America. All of that stuff is being 
  captured as we speak, whether we know it or like it, or 
  not.

What I&#x27;m talking about is the last 2 decades or so, a time over which use has spread further than it ever has (note: I don&#x27;t make any moral judgements on that, I&#x27;m just observing), and over which cannabis production has become so far developed that the advances over that time dwarf the progress that was made over the millennia before it.<p>There is hard evidence that THC content (to use that as &#x27;the&#x27; indicator for cannabis potency, which is an internationally accepted practice) has risen steadily from the mid-1990&#x27;s, with a topping off in the last few years at around 15-20 % for high-potency Dutch weed varieties, and 5-7 % for imported (international) varieties. See e.g. [1] (from Wikipedia) and [2] (in Dutch) from the Dutch agency who monitors exactly this. There is little reason to believe that THC content across the world in places where they import from the same places as Dutch import would be different from the content measured in the Netherlands; international measurements confirm this hypothesis.<p>I know it is popular amongst &#x27;stoners&#x27; to deny that THC content has risen, mostly because it causes marijuana to be reclassified as a more &#x27;dangerous&#x27; (therefore: punished harsher) drug as it once was in some places. It&#x27;s not because something has undesirable (for you) policy implications, that it&#x27;s not true. You (not specifically &#x27;you you&#x27;, but the &#x27;cannabis always had high THC / the Indians did it 1000 years ago&#x27; crowd) have elaborate theories but suspiciously little data on their claims. Anecdotes by &#x27;stoners&#x27; don&#x27;t make accounts of the truth, the scientific method does.<p>Claiming that high-potency cannabis varieties are &#x27;just modified varieties that existed for 1000&#x27;s of years&#x27; is true in the same sense that saying a Ferrari is just a modified version of a Model T. It evolved from the same thing, but the differences in potency, ease of use, yield and ease of growing under clandestine circumstances are vast. I&#x27;m not using &#x27;Dutch&#x27; in the nationalistic &#x27;look at how awesome we are&#x27; sense (I&#x27;m not even Dutch), I use it in the internationally commonly accepted parlance meaning &#x27;purified by high-tech and directed selection into a product that has no equal in the world&#x27;. There is a reason Dutch users look with a mix of amusement and pity at Americans who fill a whole joint with pure Mexican low-grade cannabis and still don&#x27;t get the same effects as a Dutch joint that contains mostly tobacco and only a relatively low amount of cannabis.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not using &#x27;knocked out&#x27; in the regular (meaning &#x27;unconscious&#x27;) sense, but in the drug-using sense, i.e. Cheech & Chong style stonedness. Of course, it&#x27;s true that different users have different tolerance levels, and that long-time users do build tolerance, but consuming 1 gram of high-quality Dutch marijuana is not &#x27;recreational&#x27; use; if I were to make an analogy with alcohol, it&#x27;s similar to a wild night out binge drinking, not &#x27;sipping a glass of wine on a summer evening&#x27;. You say you&#x27;re using &#x27;high quality&#x27; but without numbers, it&#x27;s impossible to gauge how &#x27;high quality&#x27; it really is (in fact, if your hash is similar to other hash world wide, it&#x27;s roughly the same as the average Dutch <i>marijuana</i> at around 15-20 % THC; for comparison, hash made from average-grade Dutch cannabis varieties (&#x27;average-grade Dutch&#x27; meaning &#x27;still better than the best international varieties&#x27;) varies between 20 and 40 (!) percent THC content, approaching THC levels of cannabis oil, which has always been classified as a hard drug, even in the Netherlands).<p>To frame the discussion further, I&#x27;m pro legalisation, and against the current direction in the Netherlands to further clamp down on coffee shops, selling to foreigners, prohibiting psylocybin mushrooms etc. I have at least 10 coffee shops within walking distance from my house, I pass by some every day while walking my kids to day care, and I&#x27;m a first-hand witness of the negative effects in terms of nuisance and street crime that the recent curbing of sales to international buyers has brought. I&#x27;m as much in the pro-lax-drug-policies as you can be without being an anarchist, but denying that THC content and marijuana potency has risen over the last decades is plain self-delusion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.nl/books?id=mxP_duKXb7QC&pg=PA14&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.nl/books?id=mxP_duKXb7QC&pg=PA14&redir_e...</a>

After you are released make sure to find strongly worded complaint that whoever you dealt with overstepped their boundaries. Scan then submit it. Put up a scan on your website and link all relevant resources that have been used to harass you and jail you for that period of time.

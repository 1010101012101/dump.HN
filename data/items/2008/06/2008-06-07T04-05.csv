We're just going to support Windows at first, but in theory, versions for the other systems should be pretty easy as we're using cross platform sound and networking libraries as well.<p>I am torn, though, in deciding whether or not to support these other platforms even if the port is quite easy.  I don't know if the extra people that it would bring in would be worth the extra QA to maintain three different versions on the client.",1212813916

If I had to name one person who tossed me into the world of non-fiction intellectual books, it would be Taleb. As I learn more and  read more I see more connections between him and others (eg he is a part of EDGE.org where I learned about Dawkins, Zimbardo. Through him I also know of Yossi Vardi and Benoit Mandelbrot. He probably also has connections with Douglas Hofstadter, another cool guy.)<p>I like Taleb.<p>For anyone who has read The Black Swan, you will see how this DARPA project may have to do with his Las Vegas casino visit.  <a href=""http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/math/appliedcompmath/rum/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/math/appliedcompmath/rum/in...</a>",1212811728

211390,comment,211294,211294,0,0,lux,,,"It's tough.  I started my first company on my own, had a sales guy for several years and a few coders on contracts as well, but as a mainly solo gig it's been tough to balance all the tasks you need to do.  The tasks that tend to suffer the most are the business and promotion sides of things.  It's fortunately been able to stay at a steady pace for a long time on almost no promotion, just word of mouth, but I'm sure with another solid partner it could have gotten a fair bit bigger by now.<p>I also started a startup solo a couple years ago, and the combination of running my other company by day (splitting my time) and being the only person to do everything certainly factored strongly in its early demise.  Got to about 10,000 users but couldn't take it to the next level because there was simply not enough time in one day.<p>My new startup that's launching any day now (waiting on a couple things like payment processing to be hooked up) is a partnership, and while I'm still splitting my time with my main company and I'm also the only programmer, it's been way better because it's two and not just one of us.  After these experiences, I'm now definitely sold on PG's recommendation of having more than one founder.  The key still is to find the <i>right</i> co-founder, but I think unless you want to work 16-hour days (which isn't sustainable!) then you need 2+ people involved.",1212811382

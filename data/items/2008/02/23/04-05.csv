121848,comment,121803,121803,0,0,neilc,,,"Does anyone have a link to the actual blog entry? I'd be curious to read Marc A's actual analysis of the newspaper business, rather than have it reported second-hand by a journalist. It doesn't seem to be up at blog.pmarca.com yet, though.<p>That said, I think the idea of immediately killing the dead-tree version of the NYT is flat-out laughable. Obviously the media business is moving online, and it's crazy for the NYT not to have some more clued-in people on their board, but killing off the paper version of the NYT is a sure-fire way to eliminate one of the NYT's most valuable assets (its priceless brand and ability to influence some of the world's most important decision makers). Sure, many of those people will turn to the website, but they could do that now if they wanted to -- there's a reason they are still paying for the paper version. Plenty of those important decision-makers are old-fashioned folks that actual want something they can hold, and read on the subway, on the airplane, or at the gym. Online media is making progress toward making dead tree editions redundant, but that hasn't happened yet.<p>But since I haven't read Marc A's actual analysis, it's hard to tell if he's serious or not.",1203742030

Pittsburgh has a thing where they try and encourage bright young people to stay, because most of them leave. This is a decent attempt at encouraging people to stay in Pittsburgh, but it's counter-productive as far as actually making profitable companies. But hey, that's what investment from the State of Pennsylvania is for!<p>One of the advisors for AlphaLab was the CEO of YC company SlapVid. Whatever happened to them?",1203741997

121842,comment,121233,121717,0,0,mercurio,,,"I don't think the mode of delivery changes the passive nature of the activity. A movie downloaded and watched from the pirate bay is no more 'two-way' than one seen in a movie theatre. I read your original comment to mean that because people can do many interesting things on the internet, they will give up traditional 'one-way' things like movies and tv shows. My argument was that there is a basic human need for listening to stories that will not go away. So it makes sense for movie makers to figure out how to best fulfill this need on the internet.<p>As I pointed out, one of the biggest uses people are putting this amazing new two-way medium to, is obtaining loads and loads of one-way material.",1203741341

If you stop yourself, you won't exist in the past. Paradox.<p>Primer: yes. You will now enjoy a double.<p>Another idea I love about time travel: a paradox of ideas or substance. Give yourself a book to publish from the future. Who wrote it?<p>Star Trek 4: McCoy gives Kirk a pair of vintage reading glasses.

121835,comment,121567,121567,0,0,Electro,,,"This has to be in the top 10 dumbest things I've read online, written by a professional of course. I studied psychology, sociology and I carried on reading on them both well past finishing my college courses on them. This article is flawed and the reasons are three-fold:<p>Firstly, they discuss hedonistic pleasure. This is essentially the pleasure of getting fat, lazy and dying of hardened arteries. It isn't happiness, it's a base instinct well below our consciousness that is designed to enjoy sugars, sex and laziness programmed into us as a survival mechanism. Essentially the more you eat, have sex and do nothing, the better chance you -had- of surviving; now not so much.<p>Secondly, they poorly evaluate the pleasure of accomplishment. Your higher brain is designed to dump a load of endorphins into your system, because some minor pain/discomfort has been rewarded. Breaking down into tears at your kids graduation ceremony is artificial, it isn't programmed into people like feeling happy when they see their kid. You get so overly joyed when your children accomplish something because it is something that is a hell of a lot better for you than all the hedonistic pleasures combined, hence why they -do- wipe out all the minor feelings that led up to the accomplishment, essentially because it was worth it!<p>Thirdly, heroin blocks endorphin (the happy chemical, as well as 3 other chemicals') production. This is completely the opposite of kids, who can amplify the production. Heroin is a drug that literally disables your ability to be happy, I somehow don't see the similarity to kids here. He's comparing delayed gratification with instant gratification and immense delayed suffering/death...<p>I believe my three points are sufficient, however I must add that hedonistic psychology is an amazing subject. Although that being said, it is fascinating in a way that should educate you to do everything -BUT- the hedonistic pleasures.",1203740888

121829,comment,121597,121597,0,0,paulgb,,,"I think ideally, karma should just be there for feedback for the poster and the reader. Paradoxically, the only reason karma is meaningful is that it is useless - there is no incentive to game the system. If more karma means more power, there is an incentive to post to get karma instead of posting to help the community.<p>If you don't believe that incentivising karma is a bad thing, try this thought experiment: if you gave away $1.00 for each karma point earned, would the quality of the content go up or down? You can add some conditions if you think the experiment is unfair, but I think you would still find that the quality would be reduced with incentives.<p>Ultimately, 99% of the users are just like you and I and do not want to see news.yc turn into another digg/reddit. Why not take advantage of that, instead of treating it like a technical problem when it is really a community issue.",1203740347

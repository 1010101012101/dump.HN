What specific law means you cannot do it?<p>If tips come in individually and in small numbers and you need to track the rate of exchange, origin and everything the money I lose money actively by needing to track it.  There is no point in accepting small amounts.<p>The reason actual tips work in Austria is because they are tax except within a regulatory framework.  That however does not apply to software developers.<p>> Let me put this another way. If your friends give you money for your birthday, do you give it back to them and tell them you can&#x27;t accept their gift because of tax and regulation?<p>Actual gifts are a different tax code (they are tax free).  I can however not just pretend that any of my income is the same.  This is not a &quot;but if i read the law like this&quot; thing.<p>> but if Austria makes it hard to accept cash gifts of small amounts then something is seriously wrong with Austrian law and this is not something to be defended.<p>From what I have heard it&#x27;s not in any way easier in other countries and it does not have to be because that was never the problem.  The whole point of bountysource and other systems is to accumulate money and to simplify the whole process.  It makes <i>everything</i> easier, even if taxes would not be concerned.  It&#x27;s what makes the whole tipping thing save and easy through a middleman.",1414969153

What specific law means you cannot do it?<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the OP and the GP, but I can shed some light on this for which problems I could run into in germany:<p>* I own a company (GmbH, limited liability). Bookkeeping rules are fairly strict, I can&#x27;t accept random money from random people without having an entry in a ledger. It&#x27;s possible, but if it&#x27;s single digits then it&#x27;s probably more work than it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;d also have to figure out how to legally accept money from the US or whatever country this money comes from.<p>* I could accept the money as private person. Then I&#x27;d still have to keep books and add that to my private income. That probably would also be more work than the attached payoff.<p>* Not keeping books or declaring the donations may draw the scrutiny of the tax authorities. If you&#x27;re accepting a lot of small cash gifts you might also run afoul of money laundering regulations.<p>> Let me put this another way. If your friends give you money for your birthday, do you give it back to them and tell them you can&#x27;t accept their gift because of tax and regulation?<p>Gifts from friends and family are specifically exempt from income tax regulations, so you&#x27;re attacking a strawman here.",1414969041

Like cops, they&#x27;re there to solve painful problems that cause very unhappy memories. Anything that compels you to visit the dentist (or the police to visit you) is not going to be associated with positive forces.<p>It&#x27;s a tough job to recruit for, since so many people hate you:<p>1) Minorities hate you, since an overwhelming proportion of criminals emerge from our ranks and successful crime prevention means locking up our families and neighbors.<p>2) Liberals hate you because rappers do, and also everyone knows cops love to frame black people for crimes nobody committed, and if they were committed it was probably by a cis-male white patriarchy.<p>3) Conservatives hate you, because you&#x27;re a public employee and an agent of the gubmint that wants to seize everyone&#x27;s guns and force gay sex on God-fearing Americans.<p>Unsurprisingly, it&#x27;s tough to recruit for the job. Plus, a huge number of cops need to go undercover and are thereby recruiting from cultures that don&#x27;t share wealthier standards of etiquette. And even cops that don&#x27;t come from rough backgrounds are forced to constantly interact with awful people who understand nothing but violence and rage. Mother Teresa would adopt thuggish behavior after five minutes on the force.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t bad cops, but they&#x27;re a tiny minority of all cops and largely reflect their communities.

I am glad that there are people who are willing to take that risk in the name of improving society, and pioneer the use of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies.<p>But nobody should be obligated to take that risk if they don&#x27;t want to. I would be completely unsurprised if some emergent behavior between the US tax code and other laws meant that if you were merely aware of people accepting tips on your behalf using your name, even if you didn&#x27;t ask them to, there are tax or legal obligations. I would be completely unsurprised if the law says, if you ask them to stop and they don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re _obligated_ to initiate legal process to make them stop. I don&#x27;t think the law says that, but it&#x27;s certainly way less crazy than lots of funny corners of US tax and commerce law.<p>I would also be completely unsurprised if US tax code got complicated when you&#x27;re accepting Bitcoin as payment. I&#x27;m dimly aware that the IRS or FinCEN or someone issued guidance recently that Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t count as a currency but instead counts as a something-else... and not being a cryptocurrency user, I haven&#x27;t bothered to learn what that something-else is and how you&#x27;re supposed to report taxes on it.<p>If someone is willing to figure out how the law works, or pay their lawyer to, more power to them.

My father said once (after I had a particularly horrible, and unfair besting, by the police) that I had no respect for the police because I had never been in a situation where I had seen heroism, or been helped. The police have never stopped a robber from burgling my house, or stopped a violent crime from happening to me or anyone I know.<p>The point is, that anecdotally, the police have never appeared to be a positive force around me, except intangibly. They only seem to focus on things I myself, and many of my peers, consider acceptable victimless crimes. They focus on padding revenue by stopping speeding violations, and petty drug offenses.<p>Largely, police appear to regularly abuse their authority, ignore relevant data, and serve an agenda I am diametrically opposed to. Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a scientific study, but I think it encapsulates the hatred for police.<p>Also, there are many instances on youtube and the news, of them either covering for fellow officers, or ignoring basic laws, like speeding, cell-phone use ore petty drugs. They need to wear cameras for objective scrutiny rather than be allowed to BE the law.<p>EDIT: I should say that of course, there are police officers who work hard, are incorruptible and are genuine upstanding citizens who enforce laws and are just.

I max&#x27;ed out its specs back then and paid about $2k, including an Apple Care warranty which has since expired unused. I&#x27;ve had at least half a dozen Thinkpads before this, and none of them ever came close to surviving this long. My first Thinkpad was a 600, followed by a T20, etc. My last Thinkpad, a T410s, lasted less than 13 months before the LCD failed, same as a dozen others just like it around the office purchased around the same time. That&#x27;s when I bought the MBA on my own dime.<p>Part of it is this MBA hit a sweet spot in the upgrade cycle where SSD/CPU/RAM has proven good enough to keep for 4 years, and really shows little signs of slowing for most workloads, and could keep going strong for several years longer.<p>But the physical hardware has held up astonishingly well. It&#x27;s the most stable PC running Windows I&#x27;ve ever had. Thinking back on it... I don&#x27;t think it has EVER blue screened, and I never reboot it except for critical updates.<p>The only gripe I have with the hardware is the Windows BootCamp driver for the combined mic/headphone jack doesn&#x27;t switch the mic on when you plug in a proper headset, so it&#x27;s stuck using the internal mic. But the built-in mic is so good, I&#x27;ve never bothered buying the $20 USB mic to workaround the issue.<p>It would be hard to tally the number of hours saved on NOT having to upgrade hardware, NOT having to replaced failed components, and NOT struggling with general driver instability and blue screens the last 4 years.

Sane keyboard layout (but missing the pgup/dn/home/end column).  Beautiful screen and 14 inches, which is my ideal screen size.  Amazing gaming performance for the size, if you care about that.  Surprisingly good (but not perfect) Linux compatibility too.  The three big problems with it are:<p>1) The choice of Wifi card, the Intel 7260AC, wasn&#x27;t a good one--it constantly drops wifi connections that work fine on other devices, and sometimes isn&#x27;t even recognized on boot in both Windows and Linux.  Tried this over several Blades so it&#x27;s a chip issue, not a bad unit.  I&#x27;d rather have Intel than Broadcom considering Linux compatibility, but the 7260AC is just a nearly unusably buggy card.<p>2) The screen, while stunning if you can get a perfect unit, is apparently susceptible to dead pixels during manufacture.  I ultimately returned all of the Blades I bought--something like 3--because the screens arrived with dead pixels.  I even sent a unit back to get a new screen put on, and the replacement screen <i>also</i> came back with dead pixels, and worse, a horrible color shift.  It was my dealbreaker.  Dead pixels might be acceptable in a $700 laptop, but not in a ~$2,800 laptop.  I suspect Apple bought out all of Sharp&#x27;s grade A screens and Razer got stuck with the B screens.<p>3) The parts are all proprietary so if and when you need a repair, you have to mail your unit in and it ain&#x27;t gonna be cheap out of warranty.  Razer quoted me $200 when I asked for the cost to get an old battery replaced (as you have to do for aging laptops).  Plus, since the unit gets very hot during gaming, I expect Blades will need frequent repair as they age.<p>If you can deal with these issues, the Blade is a genuinely good machine.  Really the only serious competition the MBP has.  Razer just has to sort out their screen supplier&#x27;s QA process, and maybe make replacement parts available for home repair, and they&#x27;d be golden.",1414967458

8548290,comment,8547496,8547496,0,0,Chevalier,,,"...for god&#x27;s sake. I&#x27;m one of the few non-Asian minorities on HN, so maybe a Mexican can be honest where whites may be forced to be sensitive.<p>- - - - -<p>(1) &quot;But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I’m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.&quot;<p>I take issue with insistence on the &quot;doctor&quot; title when applied to non-medical fields. This reluctance is based on the deluge of worthless doctorates that increasingly occupy my Facebook feed as I age.<p>While her field of electrical engineering is one for which I have a superstitious dread and respect, since I struggled with elementary calculus and depend on tip calculators at restaurants -- the fact is that it IS really obnoxious to insist on the title when you&#x27;re not a medical doctor.<p>I have a juris doctor, making me as much of a doctor as she is. Any lawyer who insisted on the title would be laughed out of the profession, and rightfully so. Frankly, any industry where non-medical doctorates are not routinely ashamed of pretentious titles is probably not a very rigorous or worthwhile field. While electrical engineering is certainly not either of those, she admits that most of her colleagues do not insist on being called doctors. Is it so offensive when her students conform to industry standards of etiquette?<p>- - - - -<p>(2) &quot;Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many — though by no means all, or even most — there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it — anti-affirmative-action ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).&quot;<p>Unless she did not mark that she was black on her application, yes, she almost certainly did benefit from affirmative action and racial quotas. As did I.<p>Like her, I competed for seats against a pool of minority candidates with far lower scores than the white or Asian pools. (Asians require ridiculously high scores for competitive opportunities at the same schools.) The simple fact is that we ARE less qualified for our opportunities than our white and Asian counterparts. This doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t outperform the competition, but we definitely got a boost in securing our positions.<p>- - - - -<p>(3) &quot;How do I know? Sometimes it’s just a sense, a feeling I get from people’s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I’m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.&quot;<p>Not that her vague feeling of offense isn&#x27;t valid or anything, but this doesn&#x27;t really seem worthy of a New York Times article.<p>Her most concrete examples are where a student &quot;offered tips on how I could improve [my lecture],&quot; and where others had trouble understanding her. Maybe she&#x27;s not the most talented of lecturers?<p>- - - - -<p>(4) &quot;So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it’s not something they’re accustomed to in other classes.&quot;<p>Again, she almost certainly has not had to run faster or jump higher than her colleagues. The dearth of women (and especially black women) in engineering pits her against a much less competitive pool of candidates to fill minimally acceptable quotas. By her own numbers, there are only 140 black women working as engineering professors &quot;out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).&quot; It takes serious balls to declare this void the fault of a racist engineering conspiracy rather than the simple failure of black women to compete in rigorous fields.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible that she has outperformed her Asian male counterparts, but I would like to see her list such accomplishments as evidence that she did, indeed, run faster and jump higher.<p>- - - - -<p>(5) &quot;I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn’t just about me — it’s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.&quot;<p>This is where I lose the thread. It is not an accomplishment to be black. I am not a role model because I am Mexican. If I communicate without clarity, my audience is not racist. If there are relatively few competitive Mexicans in my field, that signals a severe problem with Mexican culture and families -- not with the institutions that hire me, particularly when they go out of their way to promote less-qualified minorities!<p>It&#x27;s great that she wants to be a role model. So do I. But aside from insisting on a pretentious title, what accomplishments has she listed that kids might look up to? Literally the only thing we know about her in this article is that her students have trouble following her lectures. Also, she&#x27;s a black woman. Does that a role model make?<p>We as minorities should not be judged by radically lowered expectations compared to our peers. Can you imagine an Asian man publishing this article and expecting sympathy?",1414966365

And he descended hard by where the heroes of Communipaw had made their late repast. And he lit his pipe by the fire, and sat himself down and smoked; and as he smoked the smoke from his pipe ascended into the air, and spread like a cloud overhead. And Oloffe bethought him, and he hastened and climbed up to the top of one of the tallest trees, and saw that the smoke spread over a great extent of country—and as he considered it more attentively he fancied that the great volume of smoke assumed a variety of marvelous forms, where in dim obscurity he saw shadowed out palaces and domes and lofty spires, all of which lasted but a moment, and then faded away, until the whole rolled off, and nothing but the green woods were left. And when St. Nicholas had smoked his pipe he twisted it in his hatband, and laying his finger beside his nose, gave the astonished Van Kortlandt a very significant look, then mounting his wagon, he returned over the treetops and disappeared.",1414966361

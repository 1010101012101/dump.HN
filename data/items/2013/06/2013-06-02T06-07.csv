This shows another benefit of exceptions, which is that if uncaught, they stop the program with a traceback of the exact point they occurred. So it's not even necessary to write most of the checks above. `error` here is a routine that aborts the program; you get that behavior by default with exceptions.<p>Whereas in C/Go if I forgot one of those error checks, the error would occur silently, leaving the program in some weird inconsistent state that I never planned for. It would just do something stupid and maybe crash or panic later on, far from the place where the initial error occurred.<p>I guess I'm just arguing for exceptions, which is old news as languages that have them have been around for quite a while. But Go doesn't offer much of a substitute of which I'm aware. The explanation of how it solves these problems has not been forthcoming.",1370154065

I've taught it to my kids, too.<p>The rules are: you imagine that you are literally invisible and find a way to cross the road that doesn't rely on the drivers' cooperation with you or the law. The drivers don't know you exist, because you are invisible.<p>Playing that game allowed me, for example, to jump onto the hood of a car that stopped at a red light briefly then hit the gas just as I walked in front of it. I was playing invisible man, as always, and had imagined what I would do if that guy, who was stopping, decided to take off again just as I got in front of his car. I imagined jumping onto his hood, which I did so quickly when he hit the gas that I landed on his windshield staring in at him with a grin on my face (instead of ending up under his tires.)<p>You can't protect yourself from everything, but playing the invisible man game each time you cross a street with traffic is a good strategy. I should add that I can't really play it if I'm on the phone, so I pause my call (""oh, um, hold on a second, I'll be right back""), play the game, and resume the call on the other side.",1370153912

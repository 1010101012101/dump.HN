8141633,comment,8114901,8115946,1,0,alwillis,,,"<i>Correct. Like Ripple, Stellar requires special (and dangerous) trust in certain nodes.</i><p>This is incorrect. A trustline between a user and a gateway is no different (<a href=""https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple_for_Gateways#Gateway.E2.80.99s_and_Trust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple_for_Gateways#Gateway.E2.80.99...</a>), special or any more dangerous than a trustline between any two users on the network.<p>I can extend a trustline of $20 to my buddy Jim or I can extend a trustline to a gateway for $20. It makes no difference to the network.<p><i>For example, gateways (<a href=""https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/#gateways"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/#gateways</a>) have to be trusted by the Stellar network as they send messages like &quot;a user deposited 100 USD via a bank wire transfer, so please accept this digital representation of 100 USD, trust me&quot;.</i><p>Also incorrect. The only trust required is for the user to trust a gateway to hold a balance on their behalf. The consensus process--you might want to read about it at <a href=""https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus</a> ensures that the all nodes agree to this change in the status of the ledger.<p><i>This trust is dangerous as people running an (initially) honest gateway may start acting maliciously and lie about how much USD or EUR or other currency exist on the network.</i><p>Wrong again. Both Ripple and Stellar&#x27;s consensus process require that all of the nodes agree on the state of the ledger before any new transactions can be added to it. Bogus transactions or changes to the ledger are easily detected.<p>From Ripple&#x27;s wiki (<a href=""https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus#Liars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus#Liars</a>):<p><i>If someone should be dishonest, the honest actors will notice them lying and can disregard their future attestations. That is, if you lie once, you have no gain as the network doesn&#x27;t care and they won&#x27;t care what you say in the future.</i><p><i>The ripple protocol requires validators to sign the consensus ledger after each validation interval. If a validator fails to do this, it will be easily detectable. Similarly, if a validator signs a ledger and then signs a ledger after that which cannot be reached by a combination of valid transactions, this will also be easily detectable.</i><p>And then you say…<p><i>By the time the malice is detected, maybe the network could trace all USD or EUR that was issued by the gateway, and revoke it, suddenly pissing off a lot of users who owns this currency as it would disappear from their wallet. Users would then loose trust in Stellar, and the network would collapse...</i><p>Nope; see above why this can&#x27;t happen.<p><i>Stripe would presumably be the first gateway trusted by the Stellar network. Okay, so what if Stripe decided they could not trust other gateways and wanted to remain the only gateway?</i><p>The model isn&#x27;t based on trusting any particular gateway; it&#x27;s based on trusting multiple gateways to not collude against you.<p>Example: you may not trust a gateway run by the Democratic National Committee or one run by the Republican National Committee, but you can be pretty confident they aren&#x27;t going to collude against you. And because they&#x27;d both are on your Unique Node List, if they agree with the other nodes you talk to, you can be confident the ledger reflects the true state of the network.<p><i>Well Stripe would be the only way to inject USD or EUR or other currencies in the network, effectively making Stellar a fully centralized digital currency, with the entire Stellar network being dependent on Stripe not being hacked, not being abused by a malicious employee, not shutting down, etc.</i><p>Wrong. Again.<p><i></i>Anyone<i></i> on Ripple (or Stellar) can be a gateway or market maker and provide liquidity on the network. There&#x27;s nothing special about Stripe, except that they have more money and reputation than most of us do.<p>It does mean that lots of people will trust Stripe to hold USD balances on their behalf.<p>If you&#x27;re totally paranoid, with Ripple or Stellar, you can decide to only transact fiat currencies with people you know and trust and act as gateways for each other (<a href=""https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple_for_Gateways"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple_for_Gateways</a>). The beauty is you can transact with people outside of your circle if one of your friends has extends trust to someone you don&#x27;t know. You don&#x27;t have to trust them, but as long you trust someone in common, you can transact with fiat.<p><i>This is the complete opposite design principle of Bitcoin which requires absolutely no trust in any specific authority.</i><p>Because the bitcoin protocol doesn&#x27;t take into account the concept of gateways between the blockchain and fiat currencies, bitcoin users are left with relying on exchanges like Mt. Gox to address this. How did that work out?",1407315189

In fact, the time you will be investing into graduate school is probably worth a lot more than the monetary cost of that education. There is always an opportunity cost. You could spend the two years continue working on your startup, and possibly get a much larger payout than a graduate education will yield over your lifetime.<p>A question you should ask yourself is: What do you want to do with your life, and how will graduate school help you with that? It seems like your goal is to do a startup. If that&#x27;s the case then you probably won&#x27;t benefit much from a graduate education, be it a business or technical degree.<p>The main resource you get out of graduate school that is directly applicable to startups are connections. Potential co-founders, advisors and early employees. The &quot;quality&quot; of these connections is directly related to which school you will attend. In other words, attending a top-tier school may be well worth it due the connections you will make there, even if the actual educational content will turn out to be useless (which is most likely the case for startups).<p>The other way to look at it is that graduate school can give you a nice break from professional life. It certainly can be a fun time.<p>PS: I was in a similar position. I applied to graduate school without knowing whether or not I actually wanted to go.

Arrow is a fine name[0], but the actual class/object names should be descriptive.<p>Also, not only the fact that .replace() can apply relative time-offsets, the quirky way it signifies it, using singular and plural keyword-parameters, it&#x27;s a &quot;clever&quot; solution but it&#x27;s not <i>at all</i> intuitive. When I figured it out, it was more of a relief that at least .replace() does not <i>always</i> apply relative time-offsets (which would have been terrible naming).<p>I wish it was more pythonic, on the whole, agreeing with the way people expect things to behave in Python modules. It says it&#x27;s inspired by Requests, which gets that very much right, so I was getting my hopes up a little.<p>Arrow.get() is totally named the wrong thing. It does more like a .create(), maybe I would&#x27;ve put that functionality into the constructor. A method called .get() should implement something very similar to what most .get* methods do on standard types and in the standard library. Which is, extract part of an object that is a container-type (optionally with defaults, etc). Of course that operation does not make sense on an Arrow object (and please don&#x27;t try), so it probably just shouldn&#x27;t have a .get() method.<p>[0] actually it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve found myself accidentally muscle-memory-typing &quot;Array&quot; a couple of times already. I&#x27;d probably have renamed this module early on in the process for that reason alone.",1407314097

It&#x27;s probably important to mention that I got the stomach for it, too, which is something that precludes many people from taking it on a regular basis.<p>With my anecdotal history in mind and weighing my person risk factors against the known complications (I dread ever being in a serious accident where blood loss becomes an issue), I have elected to take it every day.<p>Pharmacists are horrified, by the way. &quot;Don&#x27;t take it for longer than 3 days!&quot; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you prefer Ibu instead?

Discrediting the idea that something happened isn&#x27;t impossible, or in principle even difficult.<p>3. If one person says &quot;I&#x27;ve looked into it, and I found strong evidence for X&quot;, and a second person says &quot;I too have looked into it, and I didn&#x27;t find evidence for X&quot;, that&#x27;s quite compatible with X having happened.

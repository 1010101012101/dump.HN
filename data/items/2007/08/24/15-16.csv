46217,comment,46024,46101,0,0,samson,,,"I'll first say, there really is no substitute for an early startup with knowledge programmers working together(simply there is a time and cost advantage to it). That aside, it should not be the limiting factor, that causes you to pack up your bags on an idea you have.<p>I think a co-founder who puts as much effort in learning the industry and what goes on in the scene is still a valuable asset to have in a startup. Friends or people who just through out armchair ideas and can't match their ideas with whats going on in the industry don't add much value. But when a person knows his idea and knows the industry he can continually add value (beyond the technical level), and when your idea starts to change course from the original (which it often does with startups) he'll be able to adjust quickly with it.<p>But like trekker said, enjoying and being passionate about the industry will show to your co-founder programmer that you add value especially when you can continually surprise him by showing your still a step or two ahead of him about whats going on in the industry.",1187971048

46215,comment,46024,46176,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""It makes sense that people who understand a medium will have the best ideas for what to do with it.""<p>I think it makes sense to differentiate between ideas and style. For example, many of the most famous guitar players / trumpet players / musicians in general were self taught. I heard an interview with James Taylor where he said he doesn't even know how to read music. And Miles Davis only played like he did because he learned on a broken trumpet.<p>(This isn't meant to be a metaphor for hacking, but rather to point out that there is something called style that exists outside of the cognitive layer.)<p>It makes sense that the guys with the most interesting styles were the ones who were mostly self-taught.<p>At the cognitive level, it makes sense that the guys with the best ideas are those are  <p>A) most familiar with the medium.<p>B) Familiar with other similar mediums they can draw from.<p>But a lot of people don't make their money through novel ideas so much as taking other people's ideas and adding the sex. Which seems to be more of a style thing than a cognitive thing.<p>",1187970941

It is, as I said, slightly obsolete, so when you finish it you will be an expert on the cutting-edge Web technologies of 1998 (e.g., Oracle). But the step from then to now is not as large as you think. (And, to be fair, the online version of the book has been revised a few times in recent years.)<p>There is also a New and Improved book that covers much of the same material:<p><a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/</a><p>I haven't read this myself, and I believe that (as a textbook for an MIT course) it may be geared more toward hard-core hackers than the earlier book, which was intended to be readable (or at least skimmable) by non-programmers.<p>The advantage of these books is that they provide large-scale perspective.

46202,comment,46024,46024,0,0,snorkel,,,"Start by drawing your ideas on paper in detail. You don't have to be an artist because it's not going in a museum. If you are thinking of making a web site then draw it on paper, page by page. Describe exactly what happens when user clicks each part of the page. Every page, including the login page and about page. Every single page, every single clickable thing, draw it and label it. The more detail the better. You should have enough detail on those pages to be able to hand to someone without saying a word and they will be able to read it and understand it. That level of detail.<p>Then pay a web designer a few hundred dollars to turn your pages into a static mockup. Static meaning it doesn't actually work yet, you can't login and do stuff, you just look at it. It's just HTML and graphics. It's a facade.<p>Next you can either pay programmer anywhere from a few hundred to few thousand dollars and wait 3 months for them to build the functionality behind the facade or you go learn HTML, javascript, ajax, and PHP (the easiest programming language for novice web devs) and build it yourself.\n",1187969624

46189,comment,46133,46133,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I'm not sure this is a great comparison.  Many of the holders of subprime mortgage securities were mutual, hedge, and pension funds that focused on these securities by choice or by law.  Even if they wanted to switch their investments to tech, it's a totally unrelated area in which many of these firms have zero expertise.  Finally, many pension funds and mutual funds are required to hold securities with a certain credit rating... I imagine it's fairly rare to find new tech companies with investment-grade credit.<p>To be sure, there are going to be some investors pulling their money out of subprime and looking in other places.

There's too much going on at the top, 3 differently colored bars with the powerset logo, tab(s) and huge search bar.  The search bar is omnipresent, even in the individual Wikipedia page you chose.  Ironically, Google has a similar structure in its result pages, but feels completely different because the background is all white and less invasive.<p>- The Factz are often distracting and presenting useless stuff.  E.g.:\n<a href=""http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Simple_DirectMedia_L...</a>\npresents around 25 factz.  I counted 3 or 4 factz that are actually useful.  The meaning of the other factz in the context is either obscure (""parameters"": which ones?), deceiving or incomplete (""functionality"", ""ports"", ""operations"", etc), useless (""needs"" (??), ""SDL"", ""The Video""), or all of the above.<p>- The way you actually use the Factz is terrible.  First you clik on one fact, then after being flashed with the fade-out bling on the right column you actually have to move the mouse pointer all the way there, then the animation scroll, then probably move the pointer to the left to click on something actually useful or go back up to select another fact because the one you chose was wrong anyway (why? see above).  After 5 minutes of this I feel dizzy.

The more you tell somebody what something is, and the less you show them, the more time it takes for them to comprehend it, and therefore the less it actually has an effect.<p>Of course, in creative writing it's a bit harder, since there are some very good ways of showing people things that have become deeply cliched, and it's considered improper to use those techniques. That's not the case online, unless you consider glossy buttons and rounded edges to be a cliche, which is entirely possible.",1210623242

187917,comment,187575,187793,0,0,etal,,,"Agreed, but in this case the readability of the text format is only a minor benefit.<p>I didn't want to go on a tangent, but the problem is that vanilla Windows XP (not sure about Vista) does not make it safe to play with plain text files, especially those meant for a Linux system. Notepad is not safe. So to protect the unaware, we need another layer between the user and the raw data to make . Any format would be fine, as long as there's a free tool available that the customer and their paranoid IT support would both be comfortable with, which preferably might already be installed, and Windows knows not to open it with Notepad by default. Since other products on the same network already use XML, the customer is OK with staring at this format, expects that .xml files will pop up read-only in Internet Explorer, and knows that the angled brackets mean serious business.<p>If any other format met all these needs at once, I'd jump for it -- but I haven't seen anything else that does. Any suggestions for other formats that work well on both Windows and Unix?",1210623134

That commercial line made the iPhone as popular as it has become. But it wouldn't have worked that way if the iPhone hadn't had such perfect design. Imagine a commercial for the Voyager attempting the same types of ads. It plain wouldn't work.

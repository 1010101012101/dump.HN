I need simple animations but they need to be performant.<p>I was dismayed to find that Velocity and almost every other animation library out there still uses DOM-based tweening rather than CSS transitions.<p>Even some of the faster libs out there that leverage CSS transforms are still pushing frames manually and sucking up CPU cycles running code-based animations.<p>Why are people so convinced that code-based animations are somehow faster or better than pure CSS transitions?<p>I certainly understand and appreciate the flexibility of code-based animations (easy chaining, full control, older browser support etc.), but for simple things like panels sliding in and out of view, nothing beats transform3d and transitions on platforms when these things are available (which is most mobile devices, these days).",1417190295

8671208,comment,8669840,8669840,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"I don&#x27;t quite follow this description:<p>> Ultimately what we get is the following theorem. If there exists any Verifier computer program that successfully extracts information by interactively running this protocol with some Prover, then we can simply use the rewinding trick on that program to commit to a random solution, then &#x27;trick&#x27; the Verifier by rewinding its execution whenever we can&#x27;t answer its challenge correctly. The same logic holds as we gave above: if such a Verifier succeeds in extracting information after running the real protocol, then it should be able to extract the same amount of information from the simulated, rewinding-based protocol. But since there&#x27;s no information going into the simulated protocol, there&#x27;s no information to extract. Thus the information the Verifier can extract must always be zero.<p>This seems to identify a way of showing that some protocol is zero-knowledge. But, as I read the paragraph, the requirements aren&#x27;t strict enough.<p>Imagine a closely-related protocol, where I get to challenge two edges at once and the four (or three, I guess) incident vertices are revealed. Obviously, I can successfully extract the full 3-coloring through repeated runs of this protocol (revealing four vertices when there are only three legal colors means I can identify which vertices are the same color as which other vertices; given a bounded number of challenges, I can get them all). Also obviously, you can use a time machine to pass any particular challenge in this protocol almost as easily as you can use one to pass the less leaky one-edge challenges.<p>But I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s making the difference, or how the &quot;theorem&quot; helps me distinguish the protocols. The OP identifies three properties that a zero-knowledge protocol must have: 1, if the prover has a solution, I become confident that it&#x27;s real; 2, if the prover doesn&#x27;t have a solution, I become confident that they don&#x27;t; and 3, zero-knowledgeness.<p>So, if I&#x27;m an honest verifier with no memory (except for previous challenge pass/fail results), the two-edge challenge protocol has the first two properties, just like the one-edge protocol: I&#x27;ll quickly gain confidence that a genuine solution is real, and I&#x27;ll quickly discover that a sham solution is false. If there&#x27;s a time machine involved, I&#x27;ll quickly become convinced that the prover has a solution even though they don&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s easy to fake three or four vertices being properly colored.<p>If I&#x27;m a nefarious verifier with a memory, I can use the extra information that leaks from the two-edge protocol to recover the full solution if one is given, and I can also use it to eventually discover that a nefarious prover is using a time machine to lie to me (when my own illicit copy of the graph-coloring hits a contradiction). The two-edge protocol doesn&#x27;t fail the completeness or soundness tests. So it must fail the zero-knowledgeness test. How can I tell that? Does the paragraph I quoted indicate <i>how</i> the two-edge protocol fails zero-knowledgeness?",1417189455

About the only thing I can think of is taxi companies from several cities across the U.S. have to merge together, and then partner with a smaller company that can raise the same 100M+ in financing and then create an uber competitor that can drive prices even lower.  Basically it&#x27;s a scorched earth policy on taxi fares driven by VC money, similar to the dot com days.<p>Other than that, I have no idea how the taxi industry will survive, unless they can somehow get uber regulated the same way they are.",1417188318

I know Facebook more from the advertiser end than the user, and I this is my take:<p>The way adwords worked is that they put tools out there where advertisers can try X, and see what happens. If X works, they can try to do more of it. if not they can try something else. X can be the keywords you target, the ads you write, the bids you set, the landing page you use and a whole bunch  for other settings. Over time advertisers got good at this. They got more out ads, bid against each other and the price shot up. The process took years and a qanta of advertising is still getting more expensive. The intelligence is mostly on the advertising side. Adwords is a fairly dumb toolset. The skill and experience of the advertiser can make a big difference to the ROI. The average skill level is pretty high in competitive markets.<p>They tried a bunch of push-button methods. They would have their &quot;expert team&quot; set up your initial campaigns or propose changes. I tried these when they were first launch with disastrous results. They also had more automated turn key management tools. They&#x27;re also not as good as a decent ad manager. It&#x27;s hard to beat a person for creativity and intelligence. Who would have thought.<p>FB adopted this model but their platform is very different. They added a bunch of hair at a rapid clip and adapted the adwords concept in confusing and inconsistent ways. The FB platform is more of a giant pile of tools, with 9 3/5 spanners and a hammer that can be used for a drill. This might be a little unfair. The gist of search advertising is pretty straightforward. Show this result to people in this area searching for this thing. FB is a lot more complicated.<p>Anyway… They built up an ad platform that is enormous and opportunity loaded for a lot of kinds of marketing for which adwords doesn&#x27;t work. Are you looking for pre school enrollments? Promoting a comedy club? Daily dela site? Even the traditional orange juice and washing powder companies can fool themselves into thinking they are &quot;engaging&quot; customers. Anyway, FB advertising works really well for all sort of things. The demand is there.<p>The platform grew fast and no one really understand it very well. It changes fast and its confusing with multiple ways offing everything and lots of options you didn&#x27;t know exist. There are lots of black boxes of the adwords adrank variety, but too many to easily understand.<p>But, underlying it all it seems pretty obvious that Facebook want to make their system much &quot;smarter&quot; than adwords. In an ideal world, you tel it what your goals are and the system chooses who to advertise to, how, when and how. More turnkey, less control in advertisers hands. Batteries include. Pick your metaphor.<p>Back to the topic at hand…<p>I think that changing how the platform works fundamentally is allowed in the FB culture in a way that is on the extreme end of the spectrum. The way I see most software is that a software metaphor is defined by what it does. If making something a &quot;header&quot; in a word processor make the text big & bold that&#x27;s what &quot;header&quot; means. If &quot;follow&quot; in twitter means send that person a message and show me all his future posts, that&#x27;s what follow means. I will adjust my behavior accordingly. If I&#x27;m following too many people, I need to unfollow some. If twitter thinks I&#x27;m seeing too many tweets, they can&#x27;t just select tweets to show me. That changes the meaning of follow. To keep the metaphor intact, they should make the unfollow button bigger, or even suggest I unfollow some people.<p>Facebook would just look at the problem of too many posts, many commercial posts or similar and show fewer. Maybe they internally rank your friends and liked pages based on some black box algorithm and decide how many to show. Stuff like that. They&#x27;re fine with this approach even though it means the definition of friend/like/etc. radically several times.<p>In FBs defense they serve one of the least savvy median user of any software in existence. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an exaggeration. FB was a lot of people&#x27;s first app.<p>In any case, I think this is just a manifestation of that core FB characteristic. Stuff changes in unusual ways. They have problems. Eg users who like hundreds of pages that would take over their stream.  EG. my noisier friends drown out the occasional posters. The &quot;normal&quot; way of dealing with these things is to give user tools, controls or encourage them to use them. Unlike some pages. Curate your fiends list. The FB way is to decide themselves what stuff to show.<p>It&#x27;s possible that FB is being motivated by &quot;how to increase revenue&quot; for these decisions, but I doubt it. It would be short cited and it can be explained otherwise.",1417188064

Another example would be Instagram. Obviously Facebook realised the threat in both cases and bought them.<p>The underlying idea is that focussed &quot;minimalistic&quot; apps are easier to use than kitchen sinks like Facebook, especially on mobile devices. On top of that mobile phones already come with some sort of &quot;social network&quot; build in, everyone has the telephone number of people and businesses that matter to them. So the attempt of most big web companies to provide people with a &quot;web identity&quot; is mostly misguided in this case.

The operators duly setup these initial conditions, but then the regional electrical control center unexpectedly asked Chernobyl-4 to remain online (instead of shutting down as planned) to service electrical demands.<p>The reactor operators then resumed power operations and tried to re-establish test conditions at the end of their shift when they received permission to shutdown. But this shift from power operations to low power back to power operations and back again to low power induced xenon transients, and an extremely unusual and dangerous control rod configuration, all in an effort to establish the <i>nuclear</i> parameters to run the <i>non-nuclear</i> test.<p>And then they turned over to the evening shift as if they were handing over a set of car keys for a company sedan, an evening shift that had not been expecting the test (though by this point the conditions were such that either shift would have caused the reactor accident IMHO, assuming no one made the brave call to abort the test completely).<p>I&#x27;m willing to grant that professional nuclear testing groups were not actually involved in the design and implementation of the test, but it&#x27;s simply not true that this was the result of a bunch of steam plant engineers running a test that was felt to be non-nuclear in nature. The nuclear reactor operators were deeply involved in setup and spent almost the entirety of a shift setting up for this test, and had plenty of opportunity throughout to evaluate the possible reactor plant response to their actions.<p>In fact had the test simply been to take a reactor operating at power and to spontaneously trip the steam supply valve to the turbines the accident would never have happened, even without coordinating with the reactor operators first. In the actual event the closure of the steam valve was simply the non-nuclear nudge that finally tipped off a disaster laboriously arranged during a full shift by nuclear reactor operators, operators who should have known better just from first nuclear principles.",1417187968

Customers can use this knowledge to estimate what they will spend, and drivers what they can earn.<p>Don&#x27;t Uber give you an estimation? I took a taxi a single time in my life, I can tell you, I had no idea how expensive it would be (and it was) and it took me multiple call and about 45 minutes before getting inside the taxi. I still have no idea how to estimate the price, I&#x27;m still not interested in taking a taxi after all that.<p>> * Service dependability: Because medallions are limited and prices are regulated, taxi drivers can make a living, and the service does not boom/bust. This means customers are not gouged in good times and unable to find taxis in bad times.<p>This is something that I never liked and I don&#x27;t understands how people can be for that. What purpose does it make to have a unique price when you can&#x27;t even get it at that price. I will sell you a new amazing smartphone for 1$, the best price of the world and I will never change it&#x27;s price, but I only have 100 of them and I don&#x27;t plan to make more. It&#x27;s great for the one that get it but at the end of the day, if you really need it and you can&#x27;t even get it, it&#x27;s amazing price won&#x27;t help.<p>> * Non-discrimination: Taxis are usually required to respond to all hails, and to not refuse service because your ride is too short/long.<p>I can&#x27;t see how you can believe that.<p>> * Driver tracking: because a taxi driver must have a medallion and follow rules about posting information in/on their cabs, passengers can distinguish between &#x27;taxis&#x27; and random people offering ride services. While there may be no built-in reputation system, there is incentive and recourse. How do passengers know if a non-taxi is a guy who makes his living from offering rides, or a guy who just stole a car and is going to rob them? A taxi driver is risking a lot by robbing his passenger.<p>That&#x27;s depends of the service. If people require it, if it stop people from taking that service because they are afraid of it, then the offering will change.<p>With a monopoly it doesn&#x27;t, it stay the same, it doesn&#x27;t have to change, I still have no idea what&#x27;s the price, I have no easy way to make sure I will really get one fast enough. I&#x27;m a potential market but they don&#x27;t freaking care about me. At least, with competition the market can affect how it work, they have an impact on it. If we need more taxi during rush hour, it&#x27;s possible, if we need less, it&#x27;s possible, if we need more security, it&#x27;s possible.<p>If there&#x27;s still enough people interested in your monopoly taxi system, they will keep using your monopoly taxi system and it will survive but we both know it&#x27;s not the case and currently it&#x27;s subsidized by people who have no other option than taking that crappy service.",1417187669

Maybe there are good commercial solutions available?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with almost every major commercial backup solution, and in my opinion, all of them suck. Why? Mostly because of intuitiveness. I&#x27;ve seen knowledgeable techs get confused by terminology during setup and during testin/restoring. Differential, incremental, archive bit, etc.<p>Another note is cost. At one the support startups I was at, we licensed a backup solution that we customized so the customers thought it was our own in house, when it wasn&#x27;t really. Many of the bigger names can get really $$$ really fast. (looking at you EMC)<p>Backup doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be open-source, but honestly I don&#x27;t know how much I would trust anything else? I have, reluctantly at first, recently embraced the google drive ecosystem, combined with vault for regulatory compliance, and the versioning that comes with google, makes me feel more confident regarding documents stored there than documents put on random servers and being backed up to other places.<p>The problem with your original question though, is that open-source solutions still suck as well. That&#x27;s why, depending on the complexity and needs of the situation, will generally just roll my own using rsync, git, rsnapshot, etc, in a transparent way to the user. eg, user uses file server A, wich backs up to backup 1, with backup 1 backing up to backup 2.<p>I would also like to point out the growing issue of raid.

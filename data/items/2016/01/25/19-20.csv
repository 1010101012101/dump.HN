Or that heterologous genes are being introduced with CRISPR methods? Neither of these common results can be explained by the spontaneous insertion of hundreds of nucleotides that happen to precisely match the sequence of the construct being inserted.&quot;<p>The first is just as consistent with the selection mechanism, because low levels of baseline mutants ARE reported (see the Schumann et al and Hendel et al papers I linked to in this thread for examples).<p>The second would indeed be difficult to explain with a selection mechanism, unfortunately I have not seen that actually published. Instead, the primers used can just as well be amplifying the template and/or the sequence of the inserted cassette is not shown (eg Figure 2D and S1 here: <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/442"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/442</a> )<p>If you have a reference to a specific paper I would appreciate it.",1453751994

Except in cases of fraud, these situations arise randomly or due to systemic problems that can be quantified within the context of the insured parties. With arbitration, especially when mandated by an employer, the process is easily used to make possible behavior that the legal system would otherwise never allow, by people who fully <i>intend</i> to do so, just like when someone buys insurance with the intent of burning their own house down for the cash payout. Unlike the insurance company, however, the employee has no remaining legal recourse outside of a predetermined (and possibly biased) arbitration process just because it is in the contract.<p>If an employer is explicitly trying to minimize their risk and costs by mandating arbitration how can you ever trust them to pick an unbiased arbiter? If an agent is trying to maximize their outcomes by forcing arbitration, why would they then chose any arbiter that isn&#x27;t more likely to side with them?<p>You can argue that allowing arbitration is a trust signal, but at the same time it can send a signal that the employer is planning on, or at least thinks it a possibility, that they will violate some terms of the contract, whether those terms are explicit or implicit (i.e. due to legislation or court precedent). The problem is that the information assymetry between an employer and employee is so vast such that arbitration is a tool easily used to further exploit workers.",1453751450

Thus employment arbitration appears to be a\ndispute resolution system predominantly based on employee representation by counsel, as is the case with litigation.&quot;<p>So the takeaways here are the arbitration is worse for employees than litigation, and that employees usually need a   lawyer for the arbitration process.

Unfortunately the modern scientific establishment with its roots in the monastic system (academia as we know it is a direct evolution of the monastery and medieval guild systems) still persecutees heretics and tends to dismiss <i>all</i> works from those who espouse heresy. Having even a few &quot;out there&quot; ideas trashes a person&#x27;s entire corpus and leads to a kind of excommunication.<p>The general trend I&#x27;ve noticed has been this: the more we learn about our history, the further back the dates go. I&#x27;ve seen this for both hominid evolution and civilization.<p>That and the standard narrative is just weird. We know from the fossil record that humans have had large craniums and by extension complex modern brains for at least hundreds of thousands of years. What the heck were we doing for all that time? Saying civilization is only ~10k years old is like saying &quot;birds have had wings for millions of years but they only recently started flying.&quot; Huh? Really? This to me strains credulity more than the idea of lost civilizations and forgotten epochs. The latter seems like a straightforward possibility, especially if the end of the ice age involved catastrophic climate shifts that would have ruined agriculture, drowned coastal cities (we like to build on coasts), and dispersed people everywhere.<p>Even among recent ancient civilizations, only those that built massive stone megaliths are really remembered. We know little about native Americans that lived here only a few hundred years ago. There could have been massive and complex antediluvian civilizations and if they didn&#x27;t happen to be in the habit of stacking up a lot of big rocks they&#x27;d have left almost nothing of themselves.<p>It&#x27;s funny to me how much resistance this idea gets. I don&#x27;t find it that hard to believe at all. I wonder if it conflicts with some residual &quot;young-Earth creationism,&quot; even among some nominally secular folks. Even though most scientists no longer believe the Earth to be young, there still might be a kind of implicit bias against the idea that history might go back astronomically far into the past and that there might be forgotten epochs of history. None of that stuff is even hinted at in the Bible.

It&#x27;s pretty much accepted by this point that while a lot of interpersonal variation can be attributed to the catchall &quot;unique environment&quot;, almost none of it can be attributed to shared environment (or in other words, the effect of an environment on one person has basically no predictive value for the effect of the same environment on a different person).",1453750573

The government has little time to get in, and when regulations are set they are rarely updated... meanwhile the IIHS helping insurers save money (by setting correct car insurance premiums) also sparked consumer demand for high safety ratings when shopping for cars.<p>This is very much the free market at work.  Money (which people like to call &quot;Greed&quot;) drives both consumers and insurers to find the scientifically best car.  Insurers have more appropriate loses, and customers have fewer deaths (or a  better safety level for their dollars spent).<p>The IIHS makes the knowledge about car safety much less asymmetric in the market.<p>The UL does a similar thing, and I think this is the model that is more effective.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take an act of congress for the IIHS to come up with a new test and new standards as technology improves and new areas of risk are discovered!<p>Edit: I see my parent is being downvoted.

10969351,comment,10968135,10968503,0,0,tzs,,,"The index being so visible by default (as opposed to being a behind the scenes thing in most other VCS system) definitely adds some complexity. I need to sit down someday and figure out exactly how the git index fits into everything, because that is the sticking point on the one thing I used to do automatically in Mercurial that I have not figured out how to do in git other than manually.<p>I had this hook in Mercurial on OS X:<p>pre-commit = mdfind -0 -onlyin . &quot;kMDItemContentTypeTree = &#x27;com.apple.package&#x27;&quot; | xargs -0 hg addremove<p>For those not familiar with Mercurial, &quot;hg addremove dir ...&quot; adds any files from the specified directory that are not already in the repository, and removes from the repository any files that were from the repository that have been deleted from the specified directory.<p>For those not familiar with OS X, that mdfind command is finding directories in or under the current directory that have the kMDItemContentTypeTree list in the metadata includes com.apple.package. These are directories that are logically treated as if they are single files.<p>Suppose I am keeping a TODO list named &quot;TODO&quot; with my project, and I&#x27;m using OmniOutliner to organize it. The TODO list will be in a directory named &quot;TODO.oo3&quot;. OmniOutliner will keep an XML file in that directory that has most of my TODO list. If all my TODO list consists of is formatted text, that will be all that is in there, and everything is simple. As far as any DVCS goes, I can just treat that XML file as my entire TODO list. It will be no different than a code file, except that I edit it with OmniOutliner instead of vim or TextMate.<p>Now suppose I add more than just simple formatted text to my TODO. OmniOutliner allows adding files as attachments. They get copied into the TODO.oo3 tree. It also allows recording audio notes, which get stored as files in TODO.oo3. Deleting an attachment in OmniOutliner will delete the file from TODO.oo3.<p>So what my Mercurial pre-commit hook is doing is finding any files that have been added or removed in directories like my TODO.oo3, and adds any newly added files and removes any deleted files. Files that have just had contents changed will be taken care of by the normal operation of Mercurial.<p>With git, I&#x27;m not sure how to handle this. There are two main issues.<p>1. Where to handle this. I think the adding and removing of files from the magic directories need to occur on commands that modify the index. In particular, on &quot;add -u&quot;. However, I don&#x27;t see any hook for this. Git&#x27;s pre-commit hook is, unsurprisingly, for commits, which is too late.<p>2. Dealing with fancy things like stashes. In general going over ever git command that affect the index and making sure that magic directories are being handled right.<p>It would be ugly, but I&#x27;m starting to suspect it might require putting a wrapper around the git command itself, which is kind of ugly.<p>Another possibility is a pre-commit hook that just checks to see if any magic directories have added or removed files, and if so aborts the commit and alerts the user that they need to &quot;git add&quot; or &quot;git rm&quot; those files or add --no-verify if they want to commit anyway. It wouldn&#x27;t be as clean as it was in Mercurial, but it would at least be an improvement over relying on noticing in the &quot;git status&quot; I almost always do before committing that I&#x27;ve got some add/removes in a magic directory that need to be taken care of first.",1453750467

The Mercurial community seems to be working hard on making enormous monolithic repositories much more performant and realiable, whereas a lot of Git community seems to prefer to merely respond &quot;YOU&#x27;RE USING IT WRONG&quot; to these issues (although I suspect the developers themselves are also working on some of the issues; it&#x27;s just that I see the community at large as much more visible).<p>So there&#x27;s definitely a sense to me that Mercurial is the better VCS because it will quietly support whatever development model you want to use, whereas Git tries to force you to use the One True Model™--and I&#x27;m firmly in the camp that development tools should support developers&#x27; habits, not force them.",1453750467

Unsurprising, but still incredibly unprofessional.<p>Though I&#x27;m also unsurprised that looks are mentioned about when males talk about female founders. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant maliciously, it&#x27;s an error of habit. There&#x27;s probably a purpose built part of my brain just of evaluating womens looks, and that bubbles up. But calling it out seems appropriate, it has little to do with the discussion.<p>But investors investing less into female founders despite them being less likely to be swindlers/more likely to be better founders is a very interesting topic. That goes against their stated purpose, why would they do that?<p>My personal hunch is that it&#x27;s that bit of gut feeling that fills in the blanks when metrics run out that is screwing over female founders. When faced with a decision we have insufficient knowledge on, our minds extrapolate from past experience. We look at past events or knowledge that may be applicable, things we&#x27;ve heard, come up with a heuristic answer.<p>Now the thing is, investors don&#x27;t know of that many successful female founders, matter of fact, neither do I, at least nowhere close to the number of successful male founders I know of. Those mental queries that would otherwise inspire confidence come up blank, the tally gets taken, and for reasons that don&#x27;t really matter, the female founder gets short charged.<p>By the way, this process also works against other social groups and in other situations. Name 10 successful black founders off the top of your head. Chinese-american CEOs (ayy bamboo ceiling). What&#x27;s your opinion on stay-at-home dads and male nurses? It&#x27;s insidious, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Really, there&#x27;s only so much we can do against it though. One is being aware of such biases in ourselves and pushing against them, and the other much slower long term solution, adjusting people&#x27;s mental databases to better reflect modern realities. I guess we need stronger role models for women in technology, ones that do stand against long held beliefs.<p>After all, female pilots don&#x27;t seem strange (given Erhard), female programmers don&#x27;t seem that strange (because of Hopper and other very talented women), female CEOs seem a lot less strange nowadays (example that pops in my mind is Marissa Meyer), but female tech founders still do.

This happens on men and women, but it tends to have a bigger effect on women, in part because their nipples are larger and in part because they tend to wear thinner fabrics.<p>If a woman is going to go out in a thinner fabric and she knows that where she is going might be cold, she&#x27;ll put band aids on her nipples to help smooth it out under her clothing to prevent them from poking out, which can draw unwanted attention.<p>The implication here is that the man can not control himself and wants them to cover up because he will stare at their breasts if they don&#x27;t.",1453748564

There are quite a few &quot;Christian&quot; organizations (in particular, rehabs) that require &quot;biblical&quot; arbitration.  While the discussion around this is usually limited to &quot;lol conservatives are scared of sharia law and then this???&quot;, the real issue is that arbitration clauses, whether they&#x27;re founded in corporate culture or bibilical law, <i>always</i> hurt the person who gave up their legal rights.<p>Perhaps the corporate U4 agreements are more honest, as their purpose is simply to save the employer the cost of arbitration, but they&#x27;re every bit as scary.<p>Don&#x27;t sign away your rights!",1453748477

Cars in the 60s had bias ply tires (which blew out frequently and had no traction),  drum brakes (awful), single circuit brake systems that would fail if there was a leak, solid rear axles (tail happy), lap belts (if anything).<p>Old cars were several orders of magnitude more difficult and dangerous to drive.  Airbags, ABS, crumple zones, traction/stability control, and radial tires have all massively improved the safety of driving.<p>Car safety has improved so much in the past 10 years that the NHSTA and IIHS have needed to make their tests more stringent because so many cars were getting perfect scores.  A ten year old Camry would have a perfect score in 2006, but would likely fail a 2016 crash test.",1453748455

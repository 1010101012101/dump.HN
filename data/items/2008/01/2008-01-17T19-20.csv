Some people have taken the idea of ""visualizing"" a goal and have forwarded the claim that the visualization will CAUSE the world to bend to your will.<p>The author displays the missing piece of the puzzle when he says that visualization will make you more AWARE so as to take advantage of opportunities that will lead to your goal.<p>good article.",1200599787

    c = []
    c << (a[0] > b[0] ? b.shift : a.shift) until a.empty? || b.empty?
    return c+a+b

I summarized for those who didn't want to follow links.  I inserted screen shots for context.  I linked to the other sites where it was being discussed.  I added updates and clarifications in response to comments made on 3 different sites (mine, here, and reddit) to help the conversation.  And it is related to Agile principles.

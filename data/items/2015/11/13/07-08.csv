10558509,comment,10558111,10558263,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"<i>You&#x27;re basically saying that everyone should defect because everyone else does.</i><p>So, there are three speeds we need to be concerned with here:<p>1. <i>Design speed</i> -- this is the speed anticipated and planned for by the engineers who designed the road. It&#x27;s visible in features like curves, merging areas and so on.<p>2. <i>Operating speed</i> -- this is the actual speed of traffic on the road once built, and typically is measured as the 85th percentile of observed traffic (i.e., the speed such that 85% of traffic travels at or below that speed).<p>3. <i>Speed limit</i> -- this is the posted maximum above which vehicles can be stopped and ticketed by an enforcement officer.<p>In real-world scenarios both the design speed and the operating speed are often higher than the speed limit, because speed limits are often more strongly influenced -- and always downward, when they are influenced in this way -- by factors other than safety (i.e., politics and revenue).<p>Which is a problem. Good road design anticipates roughly what the operating speed will be, and attempts to match that in the design. Setting a limit which differs significantly from the operating and design speeds is only good for politics (&quot;we&#x27;re making you safer by slowing down the traffic&quot;) and revenue (more tickets issued for speeding); it has no relation to actually-safer roads.<p>And in general, yes, speed differential is more commonly a danger than simple raw speed; the intuitive explanation is that every event of one vehicle passing another creates an opportunity for a collision, and moving at a speed significantly different from all other traffic (regardless of whether faster or slower) increases the number of passing events which necessarily increases the chance of a collision.<p>Thus, regardless of posted limits, it is safer to match your speed to that of surrounding traffic. This is not a case of &quot;everyone should defect because everyone else does&quot;. It&#x27;s a case of &quot;the people who posted the speed limit defected, and you shouldn&#x27;t follow their example&quot;.",1447401210

10558503,comment,10553008,10558328,0,0,marklgr,,,"Another point of view is that the wage of the labor (eg. $5/hr) is a subjective amount coming from the negociation between the employer and the employee, and consequently their respective bargaining power. So, for some jobs, the real wage is not $10 or even $5/hr, it is effectively &quot;the lowest amount law let an employer pay someone&quot;, due to the dramatically unbalanced negociation. In this view, minimum wages protect the poorest and most exploitable job seekers from having to accept whatever the employer with full bargaining power is willing to concede. Of course, not everyone subscribe to it and it comes with its own problems too, but it is still an important part of the debate, in my opinion.",1447400958

How long does the code signing stay valid this way? Forever?<p>I think it would have been sufficient for the majority of use cases if an app sideloaded like this would only be valid for like 12 - 24 hours. I mean, as you wrote, this system is supposed to be for devs who want to test their apps on devices without having to pay for the dev program.  \nI think 12 hours would be enough time to judge you progress on device. Since you are going to test many iterations of that app, you are going to deploy it often anyway. Why would there be a need to have those apps work forever?<p>I realize there are edge cases where some people would want a longer, broad beta test for their app but is that really necessary for such a &quot;free&quot; option? Surely if you plan out your app of such scale and you arrive at that point in time to warrant a week long beta test you will very likely deploy on the app store anyway so you might as well buy into the 99 bucks a year program to correctly sign your apps.<p>Had Apple directly limited the time sideloaded apps like that work and made it public that this is &quot;just&quot; a feature aimed at developers to become interested in iOS development, this whole thing could have been avoided.",1447400913

It translates as &#x27;minimal liveable income&#x27; and is paid to people who have no other income. It is about 60 euro/month in Czech republic. In Germany it is  about 300 euro/month, but can easily go up to 1000 euro/month with all extras.<p>Problem is that one has to prove he does not have any other income. That could be problem for some people, for example illegal foreigners. Or divorced fathers who have income on paper, but everything gets confiscated for alimony.",1447398786

What follows is that by implementing it, you inadvertently hit the early-entry work force the hardest (in the US that would typically be teenagers getting their first jobs).\nApart from the general arguments against price floors and ceilings I think the other major argument against the minimum wage is that in the current systems (which a cynic could call lobby capitalism), minimum wage laws actually benefit &quot;well connected incumbants&quot; in low wage sectors who can use them to make market entry a lot harder for the competition.\nGerman minimum wage in the postage sector could probably serve as a decent example if memory serves me well.<p>There&#x27;s a chapter on minimum wage in &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; that picks up the argument of the parent post.",1447398595

But they&#x27;re running them on El Camino Real.<p>They apparently registered the small self driving cars as what California calls a &quot;Neighborhood Electric Vehicle&quot;.[0]  A NEV is limited to 25 MPH, and cannot be operated on a road with a speed limit above 35 MPH. It&#x27;s one step above a golf cart.  Local municipalities can limit their use on faster streets, if they so choose, but they don&#x27;t have to.<p>There&#x27;s a related flap over high speed electric bicycles.  They&#x27;re supposed to be limited to 20MPH, but some can reach 40MPH, and a few can reach 50MPH.[1]  They only have bicycle-grade wheels, brakes, and pothole tolerance[2], which is a problem.  At what point is a driver&#x27;s license, or a motorcycle license, required, what&#x27;s allowed on a bike path, and do you have to have pedals?[3]  There are now three classes of electric bikes in California, one of which doesn&#x27;t have pedals but is still considered a  &quot;bicycle&quot;. There are also electric mopeds and electric motorcycles.<p>Trying to fit all these vehicles on the same road and bike path system is difficult.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/pubs/brochures/fast_facts/ffvr37"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_...</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://www.electricbike.com/stealth-bomber-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.electricbike.com/stealth-bomber-review/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.levassociation.com/worldwide-legislation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.levassociation.com/worldwide-legislation</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.electricbike.com/california-ebike-laws/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.electricbike.com/california-ebike-laws/</a>",1447398287

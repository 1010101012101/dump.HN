3810092,comment,3809204,3809204,2,0,guynamedloren,,,"I am amazed that this business works.  I'm not saying it's a bad product, but rather that there doesn't <i>appear</i> to be much of a product market fit.<p>Here's why: the fields that would see value in creative resumes like these are creativity driven fields - specifically graphic design, web development, visual design, print design, frontend, etc.  Creative resumes can be valuable in these fields because they are a means to showcase relavent skills. If I'm applying for a job as a graphic designer, I would be stupid not to take advantage of the blank canvas that is a resume.<p>Concurrently, non design related fields likely do not see much value in a well designed resume, simply because it is unimportant and irrelevant.  Yeah, the resume stands out from the pack, but surely this does not influence hiring decisions?  Surely whoever is reading these resumes is not impressed by a bit of color and typography?  Though I am probably being naive here - every little bit helps, especially when there are hundreds or thousands of other resumes to compete against.<p>So with that, if one assumes the highest demand for creative resumes is in creative fields, then this is like selling ice to eskimos.  Designers can - and <i>should</i> - design their own creative resumes to market themselves.<p>But clearly I am wrong. So I wonder how well these resumes will convert? Somebody should A/B test and report back :)",1333777615

You know as well as I do that what I said is true but unfortunately Stallman's cult following absolutely must punish anyone who points out the obvious. So I said what I needed to. I was actually being sincere, not trying to outright mock him for the sake of mocking him.",1333775435

You have to have a credit card or a loan with them, but when you submit a check, you instantly get the money. However, you also have to write a little note with your account number on the back of each check, which could be a pain if you had a stack of checks.",1333775336

The user 'tptacek' can't think of any flaws in this idea, but because it isn't his own, and because his inability to find any flaws causes him frustration, he feels the need to denigrate the idea by calling it ""silly"". It isn't particularly clear A) why the so-called ""pepper"" method would be inferior to some others and B) why it couldn't be combined with tptacek's suggestions.<p>Even in tptacek's follow-up comment further down, there is still not even a single reason given as to why one of these ideas is inferior to another. If you are comparing ideas X and Y, and you think X is inferior to Y, you cannot demonstrate that fact to others by saying ""Y is a great idea"" because X may be an equally great idea, even if you think it is ""silly"" and you ""condescend"" to it.<p>This is the difference between good writing and bad writing.<p>A bad writer will tell you how to fell (""John and Cindy sat outside, watched the amazing sunset, and felt happy to be together"")<p>A good writer will <i>make</i> you feel something. Here is a cheesy example, this might work if you dig 90210, dubious in these parts, I admit. Or it just might induce nausea... (""John looked out at the sunset. Rays of light spilled through the clouds and over the rust-colored hills. A bird chirped twice in the distance by the lone birch tree before fluttering off. He could just barely make out a mark on on the tree. He turned to Cindy and asked 'Can you see it, where I carved our initials?' She looked out toward the tree and smiled. She looked over and cooed ""Aww..."", and then she snuggle-leaned into him."")<p>Good writing is a lot of work, but the alternative is to look like a jerk /Fezzik",1333775129

If you're trying to min/max your banking experience then the Chase app is pretty nice to use as a funnel for money to other accounts.",1333775028

It works somewhat analogously to a flood fill.  Contrast with other databases where you have to nominate master servers and communicate with them.<p>I gave up on CouchDB two years ago.  Partly it was a poor experience with the community, but mostly technical issues.  Writing is done to append only journals.  This means not only the added/changed data is written but also all changed btree nodes.  I was starting with around 2GB of JSON data (10 million documents).  With CouchDB it would turn into 43GB on disk (including views/indices).  With tuning, tweaks and compaction I was able to get it to half of that, but it was still a massive explosion of data size.<p>I tried MongoDB with the same data and ended up with just over 4GB consumed on disk.  In addition my data load time was 6 minutes compared to 75 minutes for CouchDB.  I was even experiencing unindexed queries in MongoDB being faster than indexed ones in CouchDB!<p>I'm sure CouchDB has improved a bit since then, but I don't think the implementation can do much better especially at the data sizes I was doing.  (Personally I think that is a rather small amount of data, one of the CouchDB developers called a million documents large!)",1333775017

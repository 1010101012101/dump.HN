I re-read all of my comments aloud in my head, and make necessary adjustments before hitting the submit button.<p>I find that emotion and enthusiasm can lead to gratuitous negativity without even realizing it, as those things don&#x27;t always translate well to plain text. Aside from posts, this applies to emails and texts.<p>Since I started this, I am almost never accused of coming across in a negative tone, even when I want to convey disappointment or other negative emotions. There&#x27;s usually always a way to craft it so that it&#x27;s perceived as constructive criticisms, and thus, well received.<p>Write with emotion, and proof read without.<p>As a bonus, I rarely make spelling or grammatical errors, except occasionally out of ignorance.",1428098389

In fact, I (and many HNers) value the opinions of others (critical or otherwise), especially those of people who are especially intelligent or experienced. If opinions were worthless, the world would be stagnant. Great companies and great science has been done utilizing nothing more than opinions (one great scientist used his opinion that &quot;God does not play dice with the universe&quot; to drive his research).<p>Secondly, the quote I took can very reasonably be taken as the most important statement Sam made, and a statement on which the rest of his article depends on. I didn&#x27;t infer motivation, though I did use anecdotes from my life experience (i.e. the empirical evidence you accuse me of lacking) to inform the way in which I interpret statements that follow the &quot;morally speaking, x is good, but excessive x is bad&quot; logical structure (which, no shit &quot;[bad adjective] x is bad&quot; is virtually a tautology).<p>And I&#x27;m sorry, but I have no clue what your last sentence has to do with anything. Sam presented zero examples of posts that are &quot;gratuitously&quot; negative, let alone numbers that support that this gratuitous negativity is rampant. Nevertheless, I do believe him that there is more ill-natured criticism than is ideal (mostly because every single community, online or otherwise, has this characteristic). Just his opinion that there is too much of the wrong type of criticism, and some information that he will be doing something about it. I offered another opinion that some others seem to share.",1428098266

Maybe Accounting still doesn&#x27;t like the idea of paying a bunch of people with money to support an &quot;open source project&quot; and figure out how to make money later on.<p>Hence we&#x27;re seeing how Joyent just didn&#x27;t own NodeJS and leave everybody to dust with tons of contributions...  if you want to own an OSS project, invest tons of resources, make sure you own a large percentage of the codebase, deliver tons of new and exciting features, put lots of marketing behind it, and make sure people have hard time to &quot;catch up&quot; thus creating an invisible barrier to enter. Hire the smart ones that still can somehow understand the codebase and contribute effectively. Another way is by providing sub-par documentation for the public to contribute, of course that&#x27;s more &quot;evil&quot; than making it hard for individuals to get to know the codebase...<p>Now we have IO.js, a &quot;community&quot; driven with individuals who &quot;work for corporation with Node interest&quot; behind them...(those APM companies and Node-based service providers wanting to be the recognized leader in Node).<p>Let&#x27;s be honest (and be real): Node is positioned to be the next popular framework after Rails. It&#x27;s not hard to see why there are so much politics around it.

Naively, multiplying two polynomials of degree n takes (n + 1)^2 multiplications of coefficients, but a more clever approach would evaluate the two polynomials at a number of points, then multiply those values together, then fit a polynomial to the results. This involves only (2n + 1) multiplications (the number of values needed to determine the resulting polynomial).<p>Thus, our clever binomial trick is the observation that multiplying two polynomials of degree 1 yields a polynomial of degree 2, so we need to pick 3 points for our evaluation; if we pick the points to be 0, 1, and &quot;infinity&quot; (in the sense of a value such that P(&quot;infinity&quot;) = the leading coefficient of P, just as P(0) equals the degree zero coefficient of P), then we get our Karatsuba trick: we break (Ex + F) down into F, E + F, and E, and similarly for (Gx + H), then multiply the corresponding values together (our three multiplications), and from those results reconstitute the polynomial product we are interested in. (And we can apply this recursively to break down the multiplication of polynomials of greater degree than 1)<p>An even more clever approach notes that we can evaluate our polynomials at various roots of unity all at once very efficiently with the Fast Fourier Transform, which is what leads to the most efficient multiplication algorithms known.",1428097440

Nurturing crazy young creative ideas and rigorous critical analysis are <i>both</i> part of Apple&#x27;s process.<p>Apple&#x27;s secret is that the criticism is directed at <i>the idea not the person.</i> That is what defines &quot;nothing of substance&quot;: the target of the criticism, not the intensity. If it&#x27;s about the idea, that&#x27;s substantial, even if it&#x27;s harsh. If it becomes personal, then that&#x27;s truly not adding substance.<p>You &quot;throw it in the cauldron&quot; and then rigorously debate everything in the pot in a manner divorced from the people who contributed it.

Instead of reducing braking power when the wheels lock, it could be programmed to reduce braking power as much as possible in the event of panic braking at high speed.<p>The second is to abuse the stability control system now mandated by law to be included on new cars in the US and many other jurisdictions to induce, rather than prevent/correct a skid. Stability control works by selectively applying the brakes on different wheels. Applying one front brake at a moderate level (not enough to lock the wheel and leave rubber on the road as evidence) would look just like an erroneous steering input to anyone investigating a crash as long as the tampering couldn&#x27;t be detected electronically.

That is a legal contract.<p>3) Of course the timing of dividends are factored into the stock price around the time they are being paid. If I know that I own something at 12:00:00PM I&#x27;ll get a $1 dividend, but if I don&#x27;t own it until 12:00:01 I get nothing it makes perfect sense for the price to change by $1 at exactly that time. This actually support the argument that stock prices are related the the profitability of a company (and hence their ability to pay dividends).<p>4) A company cannot, in fact, decide at any time that you don&#x27;t own your share anymore. It can decide to offer you money for that share and you can choose to sell it or not.<p>5) Most of the rules around buybacks, mergers, etc have to do with information disclosure and exist to help prevent company employees from stealing from shareholders. That&#x27;s not pretending that there is a relationship it&#x27;s protecting the legal rights of the owners of the company.<p>----------<p>I will tell a parable. Scientists have an understanding of gravity. Masses are attracted to each other and behave in certain ways based on certain mathematical rules.

A share is, legally speaking, fractional ownership of a company. It has certain legal and financial rights. Hence we would expect the value of shares to move in relation to the success or failure of companies. This is, in fact, what we have witnessed in reality over and over and over again.<p>You can keep on believing it&#x27;s witchcraft all you want and I don&#x27;t know how to prove you wrong.

Probably the biggest practical difference was that V8 exists in a separate repository. Spidermonkey must be pulled out of mozilla-central, and requires files in directories outside of js/src to build. Since Node (and other projects) embed V8 in their repos, it is more work to rip out Spidermonkey and keep it up to date. (source: I work with Spidermonkey a lot :))",1428095268

I personally don&#x27;t like this style. It makes it harder to read the code.

That helmet - how long would it take you to make one? You can&#x27;t just tell that team don&#x27;t sweat it, we are going to change requirement on you every two weeks. And you can&#x27;t tell the jet team wait 3 years for this helmet, then start designing the system.<p>Military development is so far outside the realm of agile that it make so sense to compare (source: I&#x27;ve done both). The things agile people struggle with I just scoff at. Building large, physical, state of the art systems require planning, requires schedules, requires rework, requires huge teams, requires reams of documentation, and so on. You can&#x27;t agile your way through that stuff.<p>Planning doesn&#x27;t lead to unbounded schedules. It leads to compromise. We have 3 years, 85 million dollars. We need an architecture (assume, say, a flight system for a helicopter, something I have done and delivered). I&#x27;m sorry, but very early in you have to choose your processors, distributed network (you need to be fail safe, so multiple redundancies are needed), and more. Then you can buy that, or simulate that; either has costs, but your engineers something to work with. Many have very strict environmental concerns - limited weight, has to fit in this bay, needs radiation hardening, and so on. I can&#x27;t wait until the last 3 months to make this decision, sorry. Somebody has to build these, deliver them. They need to design and build out the logistics chain - how do I retrofit the existing fleet? HOw do I do repairs? How quickly can I spin up my factory line if you need spares? Do we buy 3x the units you need now, or plan on JIT. This is just one tiny nit of a tiny detail that needs to be decided and tracked. Don&#x27;t forget instruction manuals, plans to train the maintaince workers, training the workers, training the pilots, building a school for the next people coming through in two years.<p>I have a meething. I could type for several hours. There is nothing agile about this problem.",1428094817

But I agree the principle is is good.<p>Its ok for people to be dumb, and for ideas or products to be shit. They exist / will keep coming. But if you want to actually contribute to the discussion, ask questions instead of belittling them. Try to steer them in the right direction instead of trying to get them to jump off the tracks entirely. Building stuff is hard, presenting things to your peers is nerve wrecking. Armchairs are comfy to speak from, but they don&#x27;t move anything forward.",1428094801

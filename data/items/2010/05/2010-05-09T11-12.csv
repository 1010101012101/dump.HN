Imagine you're living in a house for years, one day some guy comes in and changes everything subtly.<p>The walls are just a different shade, everything gets moved around a fraction. Nothing dramatic, just a lot of small changes.<p>You'd walk in and feel like you are in an unfamiliar place.<p>Unfamiliar ties right in with 'danger' on the reptilian brain level and that manifests itself as a feeling of being uncomfortable. Give it four weeks, change it back and people will be arguing the exact same thing.<p>Change <i>always</i> leads to resistance of this sort, even change for the better.",1273406385

1331864,comment,1331834,1331841,0,0,mgw,,,"I see it like this: No single person (or specific group of people) can definitively decide if the old Google design is broken or not (which in this case probably means, being worse or better than the new one).
The (arguably!) best measure if the new design is an improvement is how many people perceive it as such. My guess is Google itself has the best understanding if that is the case and wouldn't have changed it if it didn't think it was better (based on the data they gathered).",1273405038

Smart hackers will claim that ideas are $0.10/12, but an idea that is validated by market research, takes into account distribution with a well thought out marketing, is fundable, etc. is worth a great deal more.<p>Not saying MBA idea are good or even better on average, but the market for ideas isn't a ""Dollar"" store where everything is one price.",1273404832

1331853,comment,1330021,1330959,0,0,Tycho,,,"Ok after watching that link and reading these comments i'm starting to understand a little. I installed Aquamacs (other emacs clients were too ugly IMO). I can see that emacs perhaps had a lot of features Visual Studio had BEFORE vs, and that it's a stable, multi-platform, multi-language environment. I can see also that some of the text editing/formatting functions would probably work better than what I currently use Excel for. I can see the attraction of an uncluttered dashboard/interface too. And extensibility. But as a beginner I can't yet relate to this 'context-switching' problem and the appeal of running all sorts of applications inside a text editor.",1273404426

Obviously it is also important to have a reasonable UI that stays out of your search result; none of the design changes that Google have been through is disruptive enough for me to complain. There might be minor annoyances, but its still much much better than the second and third best options out there.",1273404389

And it's possible that the news just called him a ""non-scientist"" to play up the ""random Michigan guy in his backyard"" angle.<p>Or, he may be a person who takes pride in the non-scientist label. It's a class thing. Not every practitioner of the Useful Arts thinks that it's a particularly great honor to be deemed a scientist. Some of them would rather take the opportunity to point out that construction workers, machinists, and technicians are pretty smart and have been doing this sort of thing, quietly but relentlessly, since the time of Stonehenge.<p>This guy reminds me of one of my favorite engineers, Tim Hunkin:<p><a href=""http://www.timhunkin.com/90_useful_arts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timhunkin.com/90_useful_arts.htm</a>",1239544541

558423,comment,558364,558364,0,0,systems,,,"> Is the Nokia store supposed to challenge Apple? Or Microsoft supposed to? Or RIM?<p>Yes, Nokia, MS and RIM I can be sure, are trying and will continue to try to challenge the iPhone. 
I personally work for a large company that standardized on windows mobile for the sales team.
I am also sure that in time Android will be a strong competitor.<p>I also know many people who picked a Nokia Eseries because it's cheaper. I know for sure that my next phone won't be an iPhone. So in many way I am almost sure that Nokia is well positioned to compete with the iPhone. And that the iPhone dominance wont last for long",1239544304
558422,comment,557659,558282,0,0,geebee,,,"We'll see if the collapse of the financial industry encourages more young Americans into engineering.<p>That said, I actually went to law school (Columbia) for one semester before dropping out and enrolling in a PhD program in engineering (at Berkeley).  The law school is, of course, about 95% American, whereas in the Engineering school, I became very accustomed to being the only person in the room who spoke English as a first language.<p>I think it's great that Engineering is a profession where you are likely to work alongside people from all over the world.  But I think it's bad that it's become(ing?) a profession where you're unusual if you're a native Californian in graduate programs with names like ""The University of California"".<p>I'll say this - in spite of all the hand-wringing, I don't see even the slightest commitment from Berkeley to bringing in more Americans.  And as long as they can wave the magic wand and get more students from overseas, neither they or the employers who want to keep this pipeline will ever bother finding ways to get more Americans into the field.<p>As for law: yeah, they may be unhappy, but I earned 75K/year my first year out of Berkeley at Sun Micro.  Kids from the law school were starting at $125-150K/yr.<p>I actually disagree that the Americans you mentioned can't learn math.  I didn't take my first calculus class until I was 24 years old, and I got A's all the way through.  The incentives just aren't there <i>relative to other fields</i>.  And as long as we import hundreds of thousands of H1B workers ever decade, it won't be.<p>Now, we're getting a good sense of what happens when you destroy a homegrown profession and replace it with foreign nationals.",1239544204

558396,comment,557522,558048,0,0,ruslan,,,"When I read that sort of news stating Skype shares 8% of global calling, I laugh out loud at it. The truth is that 99% of Skype users are freebie users who don't pay a cent, one of the reason for this is that Skype premium services are drastically overpriced. Those, who really use VoIP for making phone calls daily, do prefer Betamax clones, as they are not only lots cheaper but also give much better voice quality! I believe Betamax makes more in revenue than Skype can ever dream off, while Betamax is still keeping itself in shadow. The thing is that one should not be a publicly known and estabished brand to make big buck. Believe it or not, Betamax and other SIP providers are killing Skype's business!<p>A good thing about SIP as open standard is competitiveness and ease of enterance into the business. There is huge number of small SIP providers all around the globe which in sum share a very significant amout of paid international calling traffic, whereas most Skype traffic is still and will be unpaid.<p>Another problem with Skype as a company is their huge expenses on running the business. Their team is overbloated with marketing and PR staff yet they did not show any progress in marketing for years! They run several headquarters in Europe where they are doomed to payout very high salaries with all the social stuff, etc. IMHO, Skype as a business cannot survive without eBay or any other corporation as big to cover them.",1239541918

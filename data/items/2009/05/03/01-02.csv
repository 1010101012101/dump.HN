While that is a good sentiment (and probably a good idea), the point I took away from the article is that if people really use the web to its full potential, the NY Times wouldn't <i>have</i> to reprint that story, since its existence could be linked to and summoned and quoted by anyone who wanted to look, since it's there. The web is so much about what's happening right now that people, I think, sometimes forget to look at it through the lens of an enormous reasonably-easily-accessible historical record.",1241315877

Your rule suggests the person at position 8 can't start eating but the person at position 7 can, correct?<p>I suppose the theory is that the person at position 8 shouldn't start eating out of deference to the person at position 9, but in that case the person at 8 effectively doesn't have food (they have it but can't eat, which is equivalent to not having food). So, if 8 should defer because of 9, shouldn't 7 defer because of 8?",1241315873

It is very easy. They don't start adding power to the line until a little past a zero crossing, which solves both the sync issue and the line down issue.<p>> Say that you're producing 10A of current with your little device. If your breakers are 15A breakers, now they won't trip until 25A of current is running through that circuit.<p>Only partially true, depending on where you measure the amperage, but I doubt it'd be UL and/or NEC approved to be on anything but a dedicated circuit. If the device is the first thing after the breaker, then 25A could be flowing on the load side of the breaker. However, if it's the last thing in the circuit, the setup is completely safe.

Any load is already unbalancing the three-phase transmission lines. Luckily, throwing a similar number of houses on each phase balances out. But if all the houses on one phase turned on their electric heaters and ovens and the houses on the other phases turned off everything, you'd have one unbalanced transformer, but the grid would still remain within tolerance. Now, if you picked a good 10,000 houses all on a single phase spread across a service area, maybe you'd begin to have a detectable problem.<p>2. Your outlets are spread semi-randomly around to each half, so if you only plugged things in one half, you could only draw half the rated power before blowing the breaker.<p>So it's not a problem, as you seem to imply.",1241315038

590395,comment,589346,590240,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Isn't your response just whataboutery?  I think part of the author's thesis is that misogyny is handled in numerous other analyses.  However, even in situations where allegations of patriarchy are ludicrous, certain trends are still present.  It is not necessary to catalog every true example of misogyny in order to argue against <i>some</i> allegations of oppression.<p><i>Maybe part of the reason that women didn't build boats and sail around the world was because women weren't allowed to own property in many areas of the world, or because women were prohibited from obtaining an education and learning astronomy.</i><p>Certainly, in some cases.  But even in cultures where women are granted the same rights as men, certain lifestyles seem to be much more popular with men than with women; hence far more men among soldiers, death row inmates, and Fortune 500 CEOs.  In cases where we notice more men than women reaping a specific reward, we ought to at least consider different preferences owing to biological/evolutionary origins.<p>But I see what you're saying.  I would have liked to hear some discussion of the blatant and real misogyny that exists in the world.

But, is this the best use of his time?  The opportunity cost is quite high, much as it is for any truly world class academic.  What fraction of the value would I receive if I watched a series of video lectures he produced on the subject?  One could argue that all interactivity would be lost, but I'd counter that the large size of most university lecture classes precludes all but a few questions per class.  Would I be better served watching PG's videos (or reading his book) and having a recitation of sorts with a lesser, but still competent Lisper?<p>One argument for taking courses from faculty active in research is that they can incorporate recent advances in their fields into the curriculum.  Undergraduate calculus does not benefit much, though.  It's not like anything taught wasn't known 200 years ago.<p>I picked on math for poets because classes in those genre often require much one-on-one tutoring, review classes, etc.  The professors who ran such courses were often  more project manager than teacher.  Many teaching assistants were involved, and duties were shared.  I could understand having some guest lectures from various faculty members, but burdening them with tutoring some pre-med major on integration techniques doesn't seem like a good use of time.",1241312907

It always remembered it as a horrible accident (which it was), significantly due to the errors involved, and the massive impact it had on the victims involved.<p>If I read your post correctly, it should not be attributed to plutonium. Would you mind elaborating on what kind of radioactive fumes/waste this could&#x27;ve been?<p>While the number of victims may be high, the number of casualties is impossible to determine: could range from 50s to 200,000s.

In the case of discovery of new product types, it seems to be a valid issue.

How often does your development shop experience this friction really?<p>The article is arguing against the entire business model and workflow of these agencies: <i>...most of it comes from traditional marketing and design. It&#x27;s an approach that&#x27;s worked for creative agencies: magazines, TV advertisements, advertising campaigns  all these things are planned meticulously up front. In some cases, it&#x27;s necessary  after all, it&#x27;s harder to change an advertisement that&#x27;s aired, or a magazine that&#x27;s been printed then it is to change software...When dealing with traditional creative agencies its a well known fact that designs will not go back once they are pronounced final because they are too expensive to re-engage.</i><p>What he&#x27;s advocating for is a change in the contract terms for their creative industries. So phrasing the solution in terms of &quot;NoPSD movement&quot; makes for good blog, but even as a metaphor for asset workflow it just totally understates the fundamental-ness of what he&#x27;s asking. It&#x27;s as if we were going to reign in unrecognized cyclic dependencies on Wall Street in the from of credit-default swaps by advocating a &quot;NoXLS movement&quot;.<p>Of course this is largely innocuous in the grand sceme of things.

The one gets the word out about a product or service and lets the creator point out why their audience would like it. A review&#x27;s purpose is to let others know if the product or service lives up to the advertising and lets you gauge how good a fit a given product is in relation to competitors or on its own.<p>We need both. Advertising can be unethical at times but its no reason to do away with it all together. Reviews cAn be flawed too.<p>As far as AdBlock goes, I&#x27;m still uncertain of why people dislike advertising so much to begin with. Okay, they collect information about you. I understand the desire to not want to be tracked like that. But lets imagine for a moment that advertisers are collecting your information but they&#x27;re not doing anything unethical with it. They&#x27;re just trying to show you add that are relevant. In that situation I really don&#x27;t care if I see advertisements online at all. I also think the definition of unethical comes into play here too though. For me, advertisers sharing my data with each other is something I don&#x27;t see as unethical. Others I suspect do. Living the lifestyle I live, I can&#x27;t think of anything advertisers could know about me that would be at all harmful.

Almost a year later, still lame off and on, my wife felt odd swelling on his leg bone.  A new vet took more x-rays and found large lesions just above his ankle.  We are lucky it did not affect his lungs, but it settled in his bones which seems painful.  He has been on fluconazole for a couple of months and the masses on his leg are shrinking.

The proliferation risk is non-zero, but processing spent fuel is a pretty nasty business and the amount of plutonium there is so small as to be a big expense for the small yield.<p>The problem with plutonium is a properly designed <i>military</i> reactor can take the precious U235 you might build only one half a bomb with, and generate enough plutonium to create 2 or 3 implosion devices.<p>That is a big reason the neighbors to Iran and NK are not panicking.  NK might have a bomb or two.  Iran might eventually build a bomb or two.  In both cases, their expertise is limited to uranium (so far), so the number of bombs they are likely to ever own within my lifetime is very few -- their stockpiles of uranium too modest to create a larger weapons stockpile.  To actually <i>use</i> a bomb is so reckless that you need a couple dozen bombs in your back pocket to deter the overwhelming payback.  Both NK and Iran are a million miles away from getting there; they need both much more uranium and plutonium expertise to even start an attempt.<p>If they believed their safety were at stake, South Korea or Japan would build 50 bombs -- they are skilled at the requisite technologies.

But still, all ads that are getting on the white list are mild, and not the kind of ad that made once everybody of us that pissed off, that we started to use ad blockers.<p>Another thing I would like to mention is that, around the same time Adblock Plus introduced &quot;Acceptable Ads&quot;, a lot of websites at least here in Germany started to detect ad blockers and asked the user to disable his ad blocker. Otherwise the website refused to deliver content or provide functionality. With the increase of popularity of ad blockers, the people running websites driven by ads will no longer tolerate that their ads are blocked. And there will be probably nothing you can do against that. Considering that, it is actually great that those websites can just get on a white list used by the majority of AdBlock Plus users.

The elder Esmark was not able to identify it and sent a sample to Swedish chemist Jns Jakob Berzelius for examination in 1828. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element, which he named thorium after Thor, the Norse god of thunder.[17] He published his findings in 1829.[50][51][52]</i><p>The fact that Thor Energy is Norwegian might just be due to the country being at the same time very wealthy and environment-minded.

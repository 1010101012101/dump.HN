Especially when it&#x27;s half way across the world, and a government that doesn&#x27;t like to open it&#x27;s books to outsiders.<p>Just looking at the chart there could be another crash seeing that the SSE has failed to close above the crucial 4000 line. People are taking profits and looking to park their money in West Coast real estate. When the 1400 companies banned from trading suddenly find the herd is gone, they are in for a nasty surprise since they put up their company as collateral to raise capital and they will face margin calls and in turn banks facing margin calls themselves with each other, and being forced to write off the mountain of debt from overbuilding will cause catastrophic failure that will make Tokyo&#x27;s bubble look tiny.<p>One thing is for sure, the China that emerges from this market collapse will be a very different one from the one we have today. Further manipulation and showing lack of control of the markets will be the CCP&#x27;s final undoing. Some members of the party including the current leadership Xi knows this and save himself as the guy &#x27;that tried&#x27; and save himself to the trip to Hague when they throw jiang zemin under the bus instead.",1436774356

9876909,comment,9875731,9876801,0,0,calibraxis,,,"Chomsky said some interesting things about science’s impact on engineering/medicine:<p><i>“Until very recently engineers learned from the sciences, but most of what they knew was craft. The crafts were so much more advanced than theoretical understanding that the engineers worked like artists. You know, you learned how to do it. Physics didn’t really get to contribute to engineering theory until fairly recently. In fact, when I got to MIT not that long ago in the 1950s, it was still largely an engineering school, and physics was taught as a service. But if engineers wanted to construct electric circuits or build a bridge and so on, you learned for the profession and you learned some physics – and it helped you, but now it’s changed.”</i> (<a href=""http://www.justresponse.net/chomsky_offers_advice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justresponse.net/chomsky_offers_advice.html</a>)<p>Science is a social movement, with a history we can look at. Like many movements, there’s lots misleading written about it. Often going into religion, especially when groups try to claim its prestige for themselves. (We might include mainstream economics here, but hilariously many capitalist economists aim beyond science, closer to math. At least many Marxists &quot;only&quot; claimed to have Scientific Truths.)",1436774224

Some new (OpusModus) and some old (PWGL, OpenMusic, Symbolic Composer). There are a few theorem provers used like ACL2 and PVS (Nasa). In CAD several Lisp system were bought off the market (for example iCAD by Dassault), but others still exist (like Genworks, or PTC&#x27;s CREO elements). There are some of these clusters, small but interesting.<p>Shortly after the AI winter Lisp was mostly dead and only a few barely maintained implementations have remained.

I have not tried the rest so I’ll just talk about Udemy.<p>The key thing about Udemy is that it does all the sales for you, which is a HUGE deal if you are just starting out and have little credentials/followings in the MOOC space.<p>Udemy works on a flash sales model. They regularly give large discounts (90%, 95% etc), especially to their existing student pool. Students pay a one-off fee per course for lifetime access. There are a lot of cross-course selling going on. This model will be favourable for you if your course has a broad target audience. You should expect low revenue per student + high student count.<p>If you want to build specialised course and charge high fees per student, Udemy is not the place for you. You can try to host your own course on platforms such as usefedora.com (startupclass.co is hosted here!) or patience.io.<p>Many of the top courses on Udemy have a common theme. They either directly or indirectly teach students to make money. Two styles seem to work best: 1) A course that teaches many skills/topics (eg. Web dev course that teaches HTML, CSS, PHP, JS etc) 2) A course that goes in depth into one skill/topic (eg. Swift, Amazon E-commerce).<p>Top earners in Udemy can make 50k to 100k a month.

I&#x27;m talking about within a single method, which inherently means belonging to a single thread.<p>> But, it&#x27;s actually worse than that because it goes beyond creation of parallel constructs: it also includes working to actively suppress the built-in language constructs.<p>Again, some language constructs are just bad. E.g. I believe Gosling has said he wishes he never put checked exceptions in Java.<p>> You need to set a property? Then, set it. Don&#x27;t construct a completely new object with a builder, just to update the zip code. In a multithreaded environment? Sorry, you need to understand concurrency issues. No amount of dumbing down objects is going to make up for your lack of understanding there.<p>On the contrary, more restrictive models really are easier to understand.",1436771326

And a common language helps enormously. In the Middle Ages (and for quite some time after) the <i>lingua</i> <i>franca</i> of science was Latin. That changed around the 18th-19th century, when a lot of work started being done in local languages (Mendel wrote his findings up in German, Darwin in English, Pasteur presumably in French, etc.) This meant that to stay on top of your field as a scientist you had to understand all the important languages (English, French, German, some Italian and Russian). After WWII, English became the new Latin so to speak, and we had a predominant language again.<p>So to sum up, if you are prepared to risk scientific isolation, go ahead and do your own thing in your own language - if a nation state is set on doing something like this, it will manage at an academic level. But in today&#x27;s globalised world, I doubt whether any commercial/industrial players would be able or even willing to pull it off.",1436771206

We get to see the cadnidate&#x27;s logic across a wide spectrum of topics.<p>This is practically a deal killer for me and Hillary. I think that W2 employment is a dying model. Piecemeal 1099 work empowers every participant to have clear and direct economic benefit and takes the power away from corporations to exploit labor with manipulation about how incapable they are to function independently. They rob the individual of identity, forcing membership in the ranks of the company as a sense of self.<p>Instead I think work will be distributed, scalable, and coordinated with great software. I think that work will happen based on real-time pricing and presence. I think that means having skills and a good reputation means you can always work when you want as much or as little as you want as long as you actually produce.<p>I hope that said great software isn&#x27;t owned and operated by a for-profit institution, but instead is a community-driven, decentralized tool.

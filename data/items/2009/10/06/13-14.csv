I'm rather fluent in JavaScript so I didn't learn much new, but it seemed like a nice short comparison of some of the mechanisms of using JavaScript.<p>Perfect, and complete, probably not.  Useful to someone trying to grasp the basic options available, sure.  The ""old school"" style may be the best way for you, but certainly would cause problems with many developers or while trying to use some large JavaScript libraries (though fortunately most those tend to use some type of encapsulation (except the unfortunately ubiquitous Prototype)).<p>If you don't like JavaScript patterns or the subject doesn't interest you read the link head line and move on.

864067,comment,863871,863966,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> I suspect you are talking of using concurrency within the same program.<p>That's one common use case for 'oldies' :) But there are some others, such as splitting a protocol handler into two layers, all the setup including environment, privileges and so on is the same, then the two layers of the protocol split and start communicating via a pipe. Now it's technically two programs but they happen to live in a single binary image.<p>> The competing technology would be shared memory threads, of which I am more familiar.<p>When unix was first developed shared memory was not in the cards, neither were threads. Unix is <i>old</i>, and fork is definitely showing how old. The initial machine that unix was developed on was a PDP-7, here are the specs:<p>18 bit words<p>4 K memory standard (magnetic cores, small ferrite beads with a bunch of wires running through them for addressing and a single read/write wire (ok, that's simplified))<p>16 K words for the machine Unix was written on originally\n(max was 64K words)<p>discrete parts only (no integration, just Q,D & R (and some 'C' ;) )<p>I'm not 100% sure if they already had 'fork' in place on that machine, but the next step up, the PDP-11 definitely had it (that's also the machine that C was born on, the first version of unix was written in assembler!).<p>> The only downside of this approach compared to fork seems (to me) to be the requirement to lock and signal when accessing shared resources.<p>They're completely different beasts I think. Fork is a way to guarantee a whole slew of things about the relationship between two processes, threads are essentially parallel executions within the same memory space (or on a single core machine a simulation of parallel execution).<p>Threads are both a great thing and a nightmare, depending on whether you've just solved the worst race condition bug in your career or whether you're still busy with it :)<p>Your 'lock and signal' sounds pretty simple, and in theory it is, in practice efficient multi-threading programs are amongst the hardest things to get right that I know of.<p>> Is there a downside to using fork within a process?<p>If you need it, you need it. If not don't use it. Like any other tool. Downsides to system calls are not really interesting, they only appear when you use the system calls in ways that they weren't meant to. What's in the core of a unix system is pretty much what needs to be there.<p>> don't you also inherit the baggage of managing those resources too?<p>Yes, absolutely. Any memory that was allocated in the parent is also allocated in the child, any file system handles that you have are present in both and so on.<p>In the case of file system handles there is usually some kind of convention on who gets to 'own' them but you can do interesting things by letting them be owned by both.",1254836480

The persistent parent process sets up a common configuration, accepts incoming network requests, and calls fork() (which is very fast) to do the real work for each request in a child process.<p>That child's work involves looking up relevant data or recording relevant data or doing a transaction that may involve only local memory, the filesystem, a DB, other processes, or other network services.  The child must also reply to the network client.  Doing this all in the single-threaded parent would preclude it from handling other requests and make it impossible to respond to hundreds of clients (unless the parent uses complicated asynchronous processing and the per-request work is mostly I/O and low on CPU ... but that complicates the server process).  Starting a separate process per client instead (as in CreateProcess() or spawn()/fork-exec()) complicates the architecture and is very expensive because all info needed for the client reply can often be housed in the original parent process and inherited by the child (e.g. locally derived/cached DNS results).  fork() leads to the simplest and most efficient architecture.",1254834298

Generally attempts to fix issues will make things worse, various tools and pages contradict each other, and the devs are only interested in the latest kernel version.  Much of this is deliberate - the code is written to not sweep things under the rug, which means you can hit problems and not recover.  Use backups and make sure you can restore.<p>The reason why I keep using it is because there is no silent corruption as you get with ext4.  A scrub can verify every byte of data is unaltered and recover if using anything other than single profile.  Compression, volume management, cheap snapshots etc also make working with it nice.  Until things go wrong.<p>The single biggest &quot;going wrong&quot; is running out of space.  Copy on write filesystems by their nature leave existing content alone and write new information in the spare space, eventually doing a garbage collect of obsolete data.

I&#x27;m trying to square this with my own experiences - I absolutely loved Rudin and to this day it&#x27;s one of my favorite textbooks; but at the same time I recognize what you&#x27;re saying about hiding the scaffolding and I share your distaste towards that.<p>I guess what I love in Rudin is that he gives the Level 2 details in such a lucid logical manner, with nothing missing and yet relatively tersely, all the details interlocking together. I got a sense of real beauty from reading him as an undergraduate that I did not get from other textbooks. I think that enjoyment ranks much higher from me than the disappointment from not getting the motivation early, which I do try to give myself when I teach something.<p>I wonder if these two can be separated: if a textbook could be Rudin-style in logical unity, terseness, and beauty and yet not &quot;hide the scaffolding&quot;. To some degree, I thought Stephen Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Analysis&quot; was a step in that direction, though it was still too wordy and meandering compared to Rudin, for me.",1431258798

Not so much the car, but its license plate.<p>This week, starbucks had a half-off offer for frappucinos.  I really like frappucinos, but their advertisement led me to believe that I had to purchase with a registered starbucks card.

9519644,comment,9516217,9519341,0,0,MootWoop,,,"> The bugs are not due to language generally.<p>That&#x27;s like saying that buffer overflows are not due to how strings are represented in C. Yes a bug is the programmer&#x27;s fault, but languages can make it harder to have bugs in the first place (for instance you can&#x27;t have buffer overflows in any other higher level language than C).<p>In the case of the hardware industry, we see a language with a weak type system (Verilog). So the &quot;solution&quot; is to use lint tools to check that your design is properly typed. Similarly, nothing in VHDL/Verilog prevents you from accidentally creating latches, or crossing domains badly, or many other small bugs. So again, the &quot;solution&quot; is to do extensive verification. That&#x27;s the Haskell VS Python debate: you can either make it impossible to have a certain class of bugs (and detect them very early), or you can just write <i>a lot</i> of tests (which, in the case of hardware, take forever to run).<p>The same logic extends at a higher level. You can have a language that models common patterns (like a synchronous loop, a &quot;ready before valid&quot; port) so you can reduce the amount of verification needed because you don&#x27;t need to always re-verify everything. One could even argue that having such higher-level mechanisms would also make static verification easier, since you might reason in terms of transactions rather than updates to registers.",1431258648

9519633,comment,9516910,9516910,0,0,bshanks,,,"Hypothetically, assume a company whose valuation increases roughly geometrically at first, but then levels off at an asymptote, and assume that during the geometric phase the valuation fluctuates by 50% around its trend. Assume that no one knows where the asymptote is. Periodically, there are funding events, during which the company sells stock at a 1x liquidation preference; assume it sells enough stock so that at each funding event, the sum of the liquidation preferences is greater than 50% of its valuation. Consider a funding event that occurs when the valuation happens to be 25% above trend; therefore the liquidation preferences will be greater than 0.625 of the on-trend valuation, and then the next time that the valuation falls to 50% below trend, the sum of those preferences will be greater than the company&#x27;s current valuation. At this point, many of those with liquidation preferences (some of whom may have a short time horizon; or may be risk-averse; or may believe that the current valuation will not rise very much in the future) may strongly prefer selling or liquidating the company immediately, which is at odds with common-stock-holders, who would get nothing in such a liquidation and who would prefer to keep going.<p>Note that in this model, this result occurred not because of mismanagement, but due to the natural and expected fluctuation in market prices, combined with unavoidable uncertainty about which price changes are fluctuations and which are simply &#x27;the new normal&#x27;, combined with the sum of liquidation preferences being comparable in magnitude to the fluctuations in prices, combined with the bad luck of a funding event happening to occur when the valuation was above trend.<p>Is this model reasonable? If so, how should management of such a company approach fundraising? It seems to me that fluctuations are inevitable and that the only thing management could control is how much money they raise at once; if fluctuations are 50% around trend, then management needs to keep the amount of money raised small enough so as to keep the sum of liqudiation preferences well under 1/3 of the current valuation (because in that case even if the valuation falls from 50% over trend to 50% under trend, the valuation will still be strictly greater than the sum of liquidation preferences). More realistically, the size of fluctuations would not be known in advance to be 50% but must be estimated. In the article, the valuation fluctuated from $1bil to $250mil, so the fluctuation parameter would be at least (1-x)/(1+x) = 250/1000 = 4 -> x = 3/5 = 60%, and the sum of liquidation prefs &quot;should have&quot; been kept well less than 250/1000 = 1/4 of the current valuation.",1431258440

I read this cover to cover, because every time I read it I am guaranteed to learn something because it&#x27;s more than I could ever hope to learn at once.<p>2. Theoretical CS texts (and programming philosophy/methodology).
I follow along if it makes sense to, on paper or with whatever programming language seems like the best fit.<p>3. Examples/Tutorials
I skim these, since I&#x27;ll just cherry pick them for the concepts I need/want to know. I might read in depth for understanding of a tricky portion or extract something clever and play with it.. but finding the right examples is so hard that I tend to look at a lot of examples and not spend too much time on thought that don&#x27;t meet a threshold.<p>So when I approach a book or other guided learning material, I&#x27;ll read cover to cover to get an overview of something but I&#x27;ll apply each of the 3 modes above to its various types of content.<p>Good dense reference material is like gold though. I read as much of it as I can. I wish I could find more of it for things I&#x27;m interested in that isn&#x27;t the f@#!ing source, because that takes longer to read from end to end.

Since I live near the campus I had the option of attending lectures in person if I wanted to (they have since changed the policy and distance ed students are distance only, unless the prof looks the other way), but my feedback to them would be similar to your idea: provide the lectures themselves as pre-recorded content, then set aside the actual lecture time to work through and review problems & questions.  This serves to free a couple/few hours a week from the professor&#x27;s schedule and dedicate it to student interaction, and it allows the students to make productive use of their instructional time.  As others have noted, being lectured at for an hour is seldom educational, especially in technical fields.<p>As an undergrad [at UVA], after my first year I explicitly sought out classes that had no more than 40-60 students, preferably fewer, just to get more 1:1ish time.

[...] Typing it in is the easiest part.<p>Well... once upon a time, people were writing software with assembly, and they probably didn&#x27;t care about the number of lines either. After all, typing was easy, in fact the only problem was just porting your program to a different architecture :-)<p>You talk about the complexity of a SoC, and you are right it is complex. But software is complex, too: an application relies on hundreds of millions of lines of code, counting everything between the hardware and the application (OS, network stack, HTTP server, all libraries, database, etc). So how do software engineers manage all that? They use better languages than assembly. Because what matters is the performance/expressiveness ratio (which is why C is still relatively popular) and how hard it is to shoot yourself in the foot (which is why C is not as popular as it once was :D).<p>> They are all toys aimed at newbies. They address problems that are no problem at all to a qualified engineer in the profession.<p>I think this kind of attitude is one of the main problems of the hardware design industry (the other one is the conservative mindset). Today&#x27;s beginners could be tomorrow&#x27;s hardware designers, instead they switch to software because the culture is much more open and friendly.

Right now they can send an SMS noting that the passenger hasn&#x27;t arrived and asking if they want to be rebooked on the next flight ... or the one after .. or for the next day.

I get to the airport parking lot, then realize that I left my baggage at home, so turn around to fetch it. Does the software assume that I&#x27;m at the airport and therefore not late? Or does it determine that I will be delayed? When does it make the assumption? Or should it assume I left my phone in the car by accident and my lift is driving away with it? How do I, as a passenger, know that I&#x27;ve passed some decision making boundary where I must now actively change my booking? Is it the airport parking lot? The entrance to the terminal? Security? The gate?<p>Same with &quot;The car rental service or taxi service would know of the delay, and the hotel might be notified of a late arrival — all seamlessly.&quot;<p>The airlines already know if someone is 1) on a flight, and 2) delayed. They can offer this service right now, even if the passenger carries no electronic devices at all.<p>I&#x27;ve no qualms with the point that it&#x27;s all too manual and expensive to do now.

I did like the analysis, but once the proselytizing kept popping up, it started to lose value and actually stoke some some of the existing tensions on this matter (we should stop teaching Python 2??)<p>So now we have to come down from the clouds into reality. For one, having limited yourself to scientific fields (sort of) you have literally chosen the tip of the iceberg. Let&#x27;s ignore the fact that the stats clearly show abysmal adoption of Python 3 among those who make a living by being on the cutting edge and can most afford to adopt. But 786 replies?? And we should stop Python 2 for THAT (even though ~700 in that set aren&#x27;t using it)??? If you venture into the commercial world, this entire analysis becomes irrelevant. My field of finance and derivative trading is one of the big up and comers in the Python space for a number of reasons but likely to costs - rapid prototyping, powerful testing, ease of training, etc. And I can say with a fair degree of confidence that there are more Python developers at my firm than this entire set - and all of them use Python 2.6. Or at least they did until a multi year upgrade migration finally brought us to Python 2.7 just this year ( and cost millions to achieve). Most are still using 32 bit, develop in Windows (on in house built IDEs) and have some split of deployment between Window client side projects (GUIs) and Linux server deployment. This is not to say we are simpletons - we have vast and complex systems, globally distributed compute grids with tens of thousands of cores (and equivalent disaster recovery clusters), reactive caching graphs, time shifting time series, cutting edge data stores manipulating massive data sets in the tens of billions of rows and basically run huge swaths of the HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS in notional derivatives that drive the entire global economy. These systems have BILLION dollar budgets. And mine is one firm out of thousands employing tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of well compensated software developers.<p>If my point isn&#x27;t abundantly clear by now, then to put it frankly: WE (and many other industries like ours) ARE the Python community. And it shifts all your stats to the point where Python 3 isn&#x27;t even statistically significant. So perhaps it would be wise to work with the elephant in the room instead of trying to pull the rug out from under him. Because elephants are big and don&#x27;t like that shit. Moreover, as a multitude of examples can attest to, any features left out of Python 2.X ultimately just get developed in house and become closed source, with a huge inefficiency in developing the wheel again and again but also locking up the critical knowledge on the best way to do it, backed by proven production deployments with big money at stake.<p>I don&#x27;t want to disway this sort of analytical review, but if it&#x27;s going to be science, it should bear at least some resemblance to it.",1431256641

So you can compare GDP+GINI to GDP+GINI+luxury cars and conclude there is no advantage of having the extra information. It basically tells you &quot;there are at least n people in this country who can afford a Lamborghini, furthermore if you assume that r percent of people who can afford a Lamborghini actually buy one, then this country has approx m=r*n such people&quot;. But basic economic data already lets you estimate m fairly well, so what&#x27;s the need for knowing n?<p>Perhaps if r varies a lot between countries knowing the actual number of cars gives you some extra information about how much that country in particular values cars as symbols of status. But, would that be useful?<p>Either way, this is very tangential to the point I was trying to make, which is that education and cars are not equal measures of the development of a society and that an educated population is more that some sort of social status scorecard :)",1431255797

I wonder if a  TA, or group of TA&#x27;s could do a better job on designing the course?<p>(I still think about some of my inept tenured teachers.  I had this Geogology Instructor who talked so fast students needed to record his lectures.  I still can&#x27;t figure out whether he was on meth, or just wanted to appear more intelligent?  He had a master&#x27;s degree, but wanted to be called Doctor.  He was on one of his beer fueled camping trips looking for rocks, and stumbled on a fossil new to the world.  He spent the next year studying the fossil, and finishing his PHd thesis.  All communication between Speedy and his graduate school was over the telephone.  He flew his rock back to the Midwest--gave his grand presentation.  He was told he found a common fossil.  He came home with his tail between his legs.  I remember this guy because he was the only teacher I actually asked, &quot;Is there a reason you are speaking like you are on speed?&quot;  Yea--I got a C in the course.  I didn&#x27;t complain because on the first day of the course he stated half your grade would be on participation in my course.(Meaning if I don&#x27;t like you, you won&#x27;t be getting a good grade.  That line of thinking probally couldn&#x27;t fly today?)",1431255684

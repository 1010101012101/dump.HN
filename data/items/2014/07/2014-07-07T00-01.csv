So this time before I left Dubai I got some protobuf libraries and basic reference docs describing some encoding schemes etc. and I ended up getting much more done that I normally do at home.\nInstead of browsing around and checking HN, I took quick breaks to read a chapter or two of a book and then opened the laptop again without immediately procrastinating.\nAny suggestions on how others get around getting sidetracked when working on personal projects?",1404694704

7996430,comment,7995728,7995728,2,0,pascalo,,,"Recently I marvelled at how far we have come since 1999, and how many changes in focus that meant. Not just tech itself, but also paradigms and methodologies.<p>Like the OP I started doing with design-y tasks as an intern in a web shop. Then followed a lot of t.gif style table layouts. Then followed some flash development, and my fist scripting with ActionScript and copy-paste JS stuff. Then ASP classic and PHP.<p>Then followed the push towards semantic html and progressive enhancement, and the first JS libs like mootools started popping up to be eventually boiled down into jQuery.<p>Couple years later and it was all about MVC frameworks, databases and so on. Like the OP I did php based stuff, and it meant learning 4+ different frameworks, i.e Cake, Zend, Symfony and so on.<p>At the same time there was Agile and TDD coming into the mix and you had to learn a whole lot on how to do your work.<p>Following that I started looking into node pretty early on and that shifted my understanding of JS as a language and pushed me into the niche where I am working today, namely JS stuff be it server or client.<p>Looking at the current tech choices and popular stacks, or even just the browser APIs available and coming, I cannot believe how far things have gotten.\nOn one hand things have become a lot easier for menial dev tasks, you have things like bower and grunt/gulp whatever really helping you, boilerplate generators and the likes. Deployment is often just a git push so some PaaS or some docker file and shell script.\nOn the other hand is just SO MUCH OF IT, that it&#x27;s impossible to keep on top of even one aspect of the stack properly if you need to get on with making stuff and have a life. If you just take the browser these days (audio API, Web GL and so on).\nIn 15 years of dev work I have learnt and forgotten so much that my brain feels like a sieve. My approach to deal with that is to not desperately try and REALLY remember many things. Instead I just focus on the current stack I&#x27;m working with and remember the general concepts of that, plus some good knowledge of where to look for things. Come the next project in a different stack I basically anticipate a learning curve.",1404693954

Versioning may be an option.<p>Sometimes you need &quot;all or nothing&quot; state management in a single microservice: You want to do &quot;POST /object&quot; multiple times and then cancel all of them on failure, for example. In one app we have a data import process which populates a microservice with a complex data model with many 1:n and n:m relationships. Instead of doing multiple REST calls (POST and so on), we build a &quot;batch&quot; object, which is essentially a JSON document. This batch lives in the microservice and acts like a persistent transaction. When we want to apply the changes, we tell the service to commit the batch. If the batch cannot be applied because it conflicts — ie., changes have been made by someone else since the batch started — the entire batch is dropped and the import starts from scratch. It&#x27;s not terribly elegant or efficient, but it&#x27;s fairly simple.",1404693729

But not anymore, frankly I&#x27;m tired of all of the changes that happened in the industry - it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m tired of learning but it&#x27;s that the changes lack substance. Learning a new framework that does the same thing like layout or user design; it&#x27;s not like learning music and digging into a deeper discipline like moving from acoustic strumming to jazz improvisation, it&#x27;s just learning new keywords to do the same crap because the old keywords have been remapped.<p>I&#x27;m reminded by a writing blog, like writers of popular fiction, programmers aren&#x27;t creating technology anymore but we are simply selling a idea (e.g., Martha Stewart for home furnishings flash sales sites, fear of missing out for Facebook/Instagram, diversion or outlet for teenage aggression/frustration for iPhone games) that validates a user&#x27;s idea that is <i>wrapped around technology</i>. Hence, tech trends surrounds consumer tech instead of system programming now and new web frameworks sprouts by the day that emphasize shaving the man-hours of a routine set of mundane tasks down by a fraction of an hour for the benefit of the agile burn-down chart.<p>This is not meant to be depressing nor cynical comment but a liberating one for me. Too often, I or I have witnessed a lot of my mostly younger peers try to reconcile the art and commerce, or to put in blunt way, have our cake and eat it too. I see that as a cowardice or indecisive but perhaps necessary stage in one&#x27;s journey of growth, not to commit yourself and not to express your personal values through the imperfect tradeoff&#x27;s and limited circumstances of a finite professional life - but be swayed by the arbitrary trinkets that one&#x27;s professional guild assigns and equating its idea of worth to your self worth.<p>VB/Pythonistas/Rails/Node.js I&#x27;ve seen them come and go like names on the Billboards charts moving to VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music/Where are They Now?&quot;.

It&#x27;s not fun when it&#x27;s just &quot;how we do things here&quot; bullshit that you have to take in because some 27-year-old &quot;wunderkind&quot; (who isn&#x27;t that great, but is politically protected) called those shots that way. There are a lot of new technologies that aren&#x27;t impressive, or are obvious bad ideas (ORMs).<p>The lack of coherence in the software career is troubling. See, what we&#x27;re not told is that (at least under closed allocation) 4/5 of us are going to be bench-warmers, given low-importance evaluative projects, and what determines whether a person gets promoted to something real, or gets enough clout to direct his career and protect his specialties, is mostly politics, not merit. (This can be afforded because, put to genuine work, good programmers are worth $500k-2M/year to the business, and great programmers are worth $2-10M. So low utilization is quite affordable with programmer salaries at their current level.) The result of this is that we have to job-hop until we find jobs where we &quot;click&quot; (find like-minded people, or win the political lottery, or just come in at the right time) every 1-3 years. It&#x27;s not fun to change jobs constantly, but there&#x27;s often no other way to have a legit career in this industry.<p>The other thing that&#x27;s really shitty is that employers demand specialization and high-quality work in job candidates, but refuse to recognize specialties once the person is on board. In terms of work experience, most companies don&#x27;t eat their own dogfood. This is also why software firms have a terrible record on internal promotion. Even they would rather hire, for a high-impact position, a mercenary who only did cool stuff over the loser &quot;team player&quot; who let them load him up with grunt work.<p>I think it&#x27;s time to consider some form of collective action. I don&#x27;t want an old-style union (with wages set by seniority alone) because that tends toward mediocrity. I think our model needs to be more like the Hollywood model (Screen Actors Guild, worker-side talent agents). We&#x27;re generating a lot of value, but ultimately the people who decide what to do with our work aren&#x27;t using it to improve the world or the state of technology, but to cut jobs. We&#x27;re in the business of helping executive assholes unemploy people, and that just fucking sucks. We need to take charge of this industry and make it work on our terms, not theirs.",1404692922

This doesn&#x27;t affect frequency sweeps or white noise, but results in impulses and clicks being smeared out in time or ringing a bit.

If Starbucks were transactional, you would have to stand there at with the money on the counter and wait until your drink was finished, then exchange at the exact same time. Even the mental image is ridiculous.<p>In practice, it makes much more sense to allow the system to enter certain inconsistent states and then remediate them. Out of an ingredient? Refund the money. Can&#x27;t pay? Pull the drink out of the queue, or just write it off. This can involve some cost, but less cost than than the throughput you&#x27;d lose by enforcing consistency.<p>For your specific example of a goods delivery service, most take-out restaurants fly in the face of these claims: you can pay the driver in cash when they arrive. They are willing to accept the risk that you made your order fraudulently, won&#x27;t pay, etc. because it&#x27;s still better for them to have your business.<p>If you reserved a time-slot or inventory for someone whose credit card is declined, so what? Just un-reserve it. It&#x27;s not hard to UPDATE a row in a database. The system was in an inconsistent state for 10 seconds. Big whoop. (You might have turned down a legitimate customer, but only if they were consuming the <i>last</i> resource, and if demand is that high, another customer will buy the item.)<p>Notice that Ticketmater and most airlines will hold your seats (i.e. leave the system in an inconsistent state) for up to 15 minutes while you enter your card details. Hell, Ticketmaster can easily reverse a transaction at any point up until the moment your ticket is scanned at the door. So could an airline, and they often do.<p>The classic example of account balances isn&#x27;t necessarily the case either - banks can INSERT records of individual transactions. Since addition is commutative, race conditions are irrelevant. Balances are then calculated nightly offline by playing back the transaction records. I guess that&#x27;s a form of locking, but even if it weren&#x27;t, the balance isn&#x27;t the source of truth - the transactions are, and the balance can be recomputed.<p>Banks also don&#x27;t hide the complexities of transaction processing. Your &quot;current balance&quot; is different from your &quot;available balance&quot; and your most recent transactions show as pending anyway.<p>You don&#x27;t need transactions as often as you think you do.",1404692799

Plenty of males have been encouraged to play with computers from the age of 8 or 10, and so will have large amounts of [at least some kind of] experience coming in to the workforce. Women are far less likely to have had this experience. Additionally, males (who will have more male friends) will quite possibly have plenty of coder friends whom they have learned from. Females statistically will have less, and have less exposure this way.<p>i.e. the culture not only makes it harder for women to get through learning compsci, but they&#x27;ll also have less exposure to it in the process. This could potentially make them weaker candidates.<p>I don&#x27;t know to what degree that actually happens.",1404691529

In particular, the bit about never diving into a proof until you know why you expect it to be true is a big one. I find it very helpful, after I&#x27;ve understood a proof, to try to put together the informal version of why it works, and try to explain that informal version to someone else.",1404691455

They looks very, very similar, but with just enough difference to suggest that they are separate. Craft Coffee only supplies NA, so, I guess I&#x27;m happy to see similar companies for the Germans, and the Brits, etc.<p>b) I wouldn&#x27;t call myself an expert, but I&#x27;d suggest you look at more of the &quot;newer&quot; West coast style of roasts. Look for &quot;medium&quot; roast beans; the old &quot;full city&quot; (or darker) will give you the strength, but little else. Growing location will not have as much of an impact on those qualities as the roast (different regions tend to have different aromatics, but if you aren&#x27;t picky about berries versus vegetal versus leather, then ignore the growing source). As for the combination of all of those qualities, it might be tricky: &quot;strong&quot; usually comes at the expense of &quot;aromatic&quot;, and &quot;acidity&quot; may be present no matter (although, for my palette, &quot;bitterness&quot; is MUCH more important than acidity--some acidity can be quite nice). The basic tips to get quality coffee are: (medium roast) beans between 3 days and 2 weeks old, use more coffee than you would think is correct (best is to weigh your beans & water), have your water temp at about 95c (not boiling), and make the amount of time between grind and brew as short as possible (ideally <10seconds).<p>c) Certainly not! My daily brew method is an Aeropress (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress</a>) available on Amazon or better cafes for <$40 (including all the filters and everything). It only makes a cup at a time, but if you are drinking solo this works (and it takes <2 min start-to-finish to brew). Alternatively, try a &quot;pour over&quot;, which is really just a holder for a coffee filter, which you can pick up for $5 practically anywhere (most people think of it as &quot;camping style&quot; but they are totally wrong!). Or, French press (<$40), which won&#x27;t have the aromatics of the other two methods, but will make a nice strong cup. Also, consider splurging on a good (burr) grinder (~$100), it is WAY more important than your &quot;machine&quot;.",1404691436

I don&#x27;t see how you had application issues during that, as 1.x and 2.x were parallel-installable, and apps had to make a conscious decision to upgrade.<p>I don&#x27;t recall the stability of the 2.0.x series, though: it&#x27;s possible they didn&#x27;t get things right and were still making breaking changes even though it was the stable series.  I don&#x27;t remember that being a problem, but I&#x27;ll admit my memory of that period isn&#x27;t perfect.<p>I <i>do</i> remember some app developers prematurely upgrading and releasing versions that depended on early development releases of 2.0 (and later, on the 2.1.x unstable series), which often did cause breakages.  But that was really the app developer&#x27;s fault for depending on versions that made no API/ABI guarantees.",1404691424

10815487,comment,10811619,10811619,0,0,meesterdude,,,"I bought omnigraffle several years ago, and have been using it a lot ever since. But really, it works for me. I know it. There is a new version, which adds some needed features, but I just don&#x27;t need them enough to upgrade for $100 or so.<p>So, they only ever made the original $120 off of me, years ago. But they obviously still need to be making money in the meantime; but short of incompatibility in some way, i doubt i&#x27;ll ever upgrade. So, I&#x27;m a huge fan of their software, but they could go out of business for being so good, if nobody ever upgrades. But if they went to a cloud solution, I wouldn&#x27;t pay for that either, because I don&#x27;t use it THAT much, and already have the app which works fine.<p>Same goes for Sublime Text; I paid for 2, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy 3; or even use it. But yet there&#x27;s a company behind it that obviously needs to keep making money.<p>The answer, classically, seems to be new users, and new versions. If your software is really good, different products. Or just target Enterprise and charge a ton.<p>It&#x27;s a tricky situation if you&#x27;re trying to make money in software.<p>But on the web, you can build one thing, and people can pay you every month to use it. You don&#x27;t even have to change anything, just keep it running. That&#x27;s a pretty attractive model in contrast.<p>I don&#x27;t like office in the cloud, and I don&#x27;t like adobe in the cloud. I think there is probably a market of people who do, and that&#x27;s great. But for those things, I prefer them on the desktop.<p>Same goes for music. I like having it with me; not tied to a music service.<p>But movies and TV shows are often watch-once for me, so a service like Netflix works well for something like that.<p>But as someone launching a collaborative SaaS, I can appreciate both sides. For me, the immediate need is SaaS, and secondary to that is offering buy once, use forever, once the economics are in place. I think there will always be some people who just want to pay for a SaaS, and others who refuse to but will pay for onsite. So, I think the best thing you can do is target both. People usually want to pay for something, if its worth it and fair. But what&#x27;s fair and reasonable is different for everyone, so cast a wider net and you&#x27;ll catch more fish.<p>And maybe one day, I&#x27;ll buy that new version of Omnigraffle.",1451523595

Leaders guide the day-to-day work, managers guide the careers of employees. I&#x27;m the leader of a development team, and while i do spend a lot of time guiding my team as to what to do and how to do it, i don&#x27;t carry the can for their happiness, professional development, etc. Rather, that&#x27;s in the hands of various other people in the company [1], who have monthly one-to-ones, collect feedback, give performance reviews, etc.<p>As a result, one of the people on my team could absolutely front-stab me without fear of the consequences. They could simply say to their manager that i was a shitty team lead. It would then be up to the manager to act on that information, by giving me or my manager that feedback. That&#x27;s not hypothetical; it&#x27;s happened (i actually am a shitty team lead).<p>[1] That&#x27;s not to say i don&#x27;t contribute towards that; if the manager of one of the people on my team comes and tells me that that person is keen to learn more about some topic, i&#x27;ll try to carve out work related to that topic and let that person work on it.

If you have the opportunity, this is always the more processor-efficient way to go (and I&#x27;m surprised so many companies choose to &quot;port&quot; their software to Linux using Cider rather than taking their source and compiling in libwine.)<p>If you didn&#x27;t have the source of a Windows binary, you <i>could</i> create a Linux transpiler that replaces already-generated Windows symbols with Wine symbols statically while also potentially rewriting the ISA and calling conventions. The only reason one doesn&#x27;t exist is that the overhead of running a very <i>similar</i> platform via HLE (i.e. one with the same ISA) is negligible. If OSX was still on PPC, for example, running Wine-on-PPC-OSX would work much better via transpilation than via HLE.<p>Speaking of PowerPC, a better candidate for &quot;transpilation for performance purposes&quot; would have been the PPC apps run under the Rosetta HLE emulator built into OSX. These apps could have been chewed-through once to produce a Carbon-linked x86 binary, that binary cached in the PPC binary&#x27;s resource fork, and then executed immediately from then on. But Apple themselves had little reason to do this—they didn&#x27;t want to give anyone an extra incentive to continue using PPC software instead of moving to x86/x64 software.",1451522301

I want every commitment and promises to be tracked and evaluated. I want fairness, and it starts with understanding reality.</i><p>Hell yes. I too want people to start treating lying with seriousness it deserves. Lying, lying, lying. It&#x27;s the thing that rots and destroys our societies. I too keep repeating that civilization starts and ends with trust. Trust people have in the system, towards their leaders, and towards each other. The less trust people have, the more defensive they get, more stupid things they do, and the less efficient everything becomes.<p>A perfect example is the growth of various anti-science movements, anti-vaccination being a prominent case. Where do you think it comes from? Many like to say that anti-vaxxers are simply stupid, can&#x27;t comprehend biology or are motivated reasoners. But the reality is simpler, and you can see it by just observing them carefully. They are normal people, like everyone else. They want to be healthy and happy. They want their children to be healthy and happy. The only real difference is that they had their trust in authority broken on a serious level. They don&#x27;t trust doctors, scientific consensus and government health organizations.<p>Is this surprising? Frankly, no. Because all of those authorities lie. They lie fucking big, and then they lie small. Not a day goes by when we don&#x27;t hear about corrupt politicians, when we don&#x27;t see bullshit papers published in respected journals, when we don&#x27;t learn a drug is a scam, or plain dangerous. Governments lie, and so do businesses, big and small. They lie in ads, they cheat in stores, they sell us crap - from grocery store washing stale meat in dishwasher fluid through planned obsolescence to good old lying about specs and working hard to silence disgruntled customers.<p>Frankly, I sometimes wonder why I still trust anyone but people I know personally. I&#x27;d like to say that it&#x27;s because of education, because I can evaluate claims critically. But it&#x27;s bullshit - a dedicated liar will run circles around everyone but the few smartest people. The truth is, I&#x27;m talking a calculated risk every day. And so are the anti-vaxxers. They end up hurting people. But that&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re evil or stupid. It&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve broken under the avalanche of lies.",1451521693

When this happens, that layer can then be considered the &quot;source ABI&quot; for transpilation.<p>Now, I haven&#x27;t played with the XBO or PS4 SDKs, but I <i>have</i> played with the Wii U SDK—and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.

Much bigger impact than I got from mindfulness meditation[0]. I did both during my morning routine for a while and was very beneficial. Combined with a weekly sangha (meditation-group) practice, which was absolutely instrumental too. Without that group, I wouldn&#x27;t have made it my morning routine--no pressure just I noticed some people were doing that and gave it a try. Then there&#x27;s the dharma-sharing part, which is nice but seems to me mostly a tool for group-cohesion (as well as an exercise in listening without judging), similar to singing songs, but more personal.<p>Unfortunately I let the morning meditations slip in the past year (circumstances, slipped a lot of good habits, exercise too, slowly crawling back out, shitty year for me). I usually don&#x27;t do New Year&#x27;s resolutions, but this is one. I do still attend the sangha, though.<p>BTW I&#x27;m <i>not</i> Buddhist. I like some parts of it, I can bear spirituality (suspension of disbelief and some of it actually makes sense as a metaphorical experience that is hard to explain words), but when it slides into religion (and Buddhism definitely has that, too) it just really creeps me out. You&#x27;re in a susceptible mindstate, and there are some aspects of Buddhism I strongly disagree with on an ethical(-ish) level. So much when after a particularly religious (almost sermon-like talk by a Buddhist monk) meeting, it even bothered my during my own meditations for a few days because the bad aftertaste kept surfacing.<p>But that&#x27;s okay, the group is quite diverse and we all bring in our own themes and stuff. They&#x27;re also quite literally one of the nicest groups of people I&#x27;ve ever met.<p>[0] which is also useful, btw. mainly for bolstering focus and both dealing with and letting go of stress. especially the unnecessary stress. but I found I need to do that at least multiple times a week, more like a training, in order to take the benefits with me in the rest of the day. compassion meditation provided insights that sticks longer (but practice helps of course).",1451520761

Uber&#x27;s service has grown so quickly partly because they have an organization behind it to fight against regulations which is part of what made their rapid growth possible.<p>* Implementing a standardized &quot;blockchain&quot; protocol to guarantee all of those things is a non trivial task<p>* Go outside of SF Bay, whip out your phone with a group and tell them that you&#x27;re about to order a &quot;distributed reputation system cab&quot; and they&#x27;re just going to look at you like &quot;wat&quot; then open the Uber app and get an Uber that already works with their credit cards and lets them split the fare. They <i>maybe</i> have heard of Lyft, and most likely have Uber, not the blockchain app.<p>* Uber has hordes of information available that lets them tell drivers where to be and when, it also prices the rides based on demand. The block chain app has none of that.<p>* Traditional cab drivers are terrible, the cars smell, they don&#x27;t show up on time, they drive you in circles to up the fare, sometimes they take off when they hear where you want to go. An app is not going to change this overnight, though eventually the reputation system might change it.<p>* Rent seeking is annoying but they are still much cheaper than traditional cabs, at least everywhere I have used them.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s winner takes all, maybe not. It remains to be seen whether the legal system has just been slow to react to Uber and its ilk or if it will not react at all. I think the end of this in the short run is that Uber takes > 90% of the market, Lyft takes the majority of the rest, and the cab companies continue to operate at a smaller scale with less profits. This is after local and state governments wake up and impose more modern, but less restrictive taxi-style regulations on these companies to enforce some level of accountability for when the shit hits the fan or whatever.<p>The end of this market in the much longer term seems to be self driving cars and some form of shared ownership.

But even if I&#x27;m being completely naive about that, it still implies a really shallow understanding of &quot;business problem.&quot;<p>Security is a business problem. Stupid ops habits that result in downtime are a business problem. Groupthink that results in acceptance of worst practices is a business problem. All the whatthefuckery the article talks about boils down to business problems. Many of these problems are such that the people primarily concerned with running the business are not in a position to recognize as problems.<p>It absolutely is my job and every developer&#x27;s job to find these things and take care of them.<p>If I ever found my self in a situation where I saw some WTFs going on and I went to my boss or a coworker and got no explanation other than &#x27;This is how we&#x27;ve always done it.&#x27; I would be concerned. I would go back to my desk and finish what I was supposed to be working on. Then I would go home that evening and write out the clearest and most concise explanation of why this is a serious business problem with citations and take it back to the coworker or boss.<p>In my experience, the WTFs don&#x27;t usually come from this is how we&#x27;ve always done it. They had some reason back at some point in the past where someone really needed it to be that way for some reason, and usually temporarily.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from several jobs ago, one of my first in the industry, actually:<p>Why does this set of boxes still have password auth enabled? Why isn&#x27;t it locked down to ssh key only? Why is port 22 accessible outside of the VPN?<p>Oh, it&#x27;s because our CEO likes to get his hands dirty with code every once in a while, but he didn&#x27;t want to mess with pub/private keys, so we just left it open because these boxes weren&#x27;t that important. They were &#x27;just&#x27; dev machines pointed at test DBs with no real data in them.<p>But it got written into a setup script or Wiki somewhere, and when those dev boxes got repurposed for production, people followed the scripts or rules or whatever that were specific to those machines. So now you have prod machines running with password access with SSH exposed to the public. Ones that are pointed at live DB servers with creds for them.<p>That&#x27;s a serious WTF.<p>I&#x27;m not even close to a security expert of any kind. I wouldn&#x27;t claim to be in a million years. I work with databases and Python, almost exclusively. Though I dabble in DevOps when I need/want to. Even I know that the above is a serious WTF.<p>What did it take to get that fixed after my coworkers said, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s how it is.&quot;?\nGoing straight to my boss, who also said, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s how it is.&quot;\nThen spending maybe an hour of my time writing up how much of a business problem this is and going back to my boss, who said, &quot;Yeah, I know it&#x27;s a problem, but I don&#x27;t even know why it&#x27;s like that. It just is.&quot;<p>So then I ask him who he can think of who might know why that is. Oh, quelle suprise, his boss might know.<p>And indeed, his boss did know. But he had long since stopped trying to get the point across to the CEO who liked to dabble, so he just went with it. Here comes my very brief paper explaining why this is--you guessed it--a business problem. The CEO responded within a couple of hours requesting that someone come setup SSH keys on his computer and shut down the passwd auth and close port 22 on all prod machines immediately.<p>That&#x27;s a lot more work than mentioning it to someone. But I think that it&#x27;s my job to do that, even though I&#x27;ve never worked in DevOps or Security teams.<p>My work was absolutely not done when I asked a coworker about it once, and then asked my boss.<p>-----------------------------------------------\nEdited to add:<p>Astute readers will note that there was a lot more WTF-ery going on than just auth and port exposure on prod. Like, for example, that the non-technical CEO who liked to dabble was doing so on a production box because he was not made aware that the boxes he was logging into to play with had been repurposed.<p>There was a lot of cascade in tracking down that one particular WTF, and many other WTFs were solved because of it.<p>At the time for that company, my job description was C# middleware for a web app. I maintain that it was absolutely part of my job to pursue that WTF to its endpoint, and that doing anything less would have been completely irresponsible.",1451520311

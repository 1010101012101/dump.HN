Can I go become an associate at a VC firm?<p>If you're interested in these kind of jobs then why not try and get one. If you want to work at Google, apply to Google. If you want to work at a VC company, get in contact with some of them and discuss it with them.<p>In my experience (of both being an interviewee and an interviewer) a degree helps get you in the door, but it's your ability and experience that decides whether you get the job or not.<p>Good luck!",1264060476

1066848,comment,1063485,1064992,0,0,ytinas,,,">The white apologist thing is just neo-trendy but true history does not support your conclusion.<p>History doesn't support my conclusion?  We invaded some else's land and nearly wiped them out.  Now what remains are spread out on reservations, little crops of land that had no value to us.  You assertion that ""Both where right and both were wrong"" is nonsense.  If some other country invaded the US today and started having that kind of  ""success"" would you feel the same?  American citizens would just be the losers in a bitter battle between two cultures?  Somehow I don't think so.<p>>The grandparent post is right, society has congealed into functional and dysfunctional land masses.<p>No, you and the GGP both confuse what we have now for success.  We don't have ""functional and dysfunctional land masses"", we have the land of the empires who were always conquering and the land of those who weren't as aggressive.  As is usually the case; the first one to strike wins.  That doesn't mean he is better or has more potential, just that he won.  We can't know what would have happened otherwise.  Perhaps we've ended up in the best situation we could have, or perhaps we could have reached a much higher level of enlightenment.<p>There is no way to know, but I find the framing  of what happened as the best possible outcome (and by extension, everything that was done was correct) arrogant.",1264060436

I'm sure e-ink is nice, but reading from an LCD all day has never bothered me and still doesn't (probably because I still have young eyes).<p>Along with Kindle books, I read online materials using the ReaditLater app after saving links to ReaditLater when I find them (often on a desktop).

While I concede that it's no Silicon Valley, I enjoy my life outside of work so much more here than I did in Palo Alto.  I'm also a Canadian citizen, so coming from Waterloo it was a lot easier to come to BC given no Visa and same banking system.  It may have a rainy winter, but it's preferable to anyplace else in Canada, and the summers are to die for.<p>I think it's easy to convince people to move here, but the tech scene really isn't as developed as TO aside from the video game industry.

The problem is that while KIPP is probably the fastest way to improve kids performance on Things That Can Be Measured, there's a lot of research showing how this approach is really bad for kids. And the pro-KIPP literature doesn't take any of this into account.

1066813,comment,1066408,1066408,0,0,matthewer,,,"As a the co-founder of an NYC startup I would like to share my insight.  NYC is a great place to do business if your startup is consumer facing with a marketing skew.  If you are an engineering company you do not belong here.  I also truly believe it is extremely hard to raise funding here, much more so than in the Valley. NY Seed is the biggest joke in the world.  Most of the VC firms are run by ex-finance guys that are not willing to take chances on ideas.  Obviously this is changing (think Betaworks and USV.)<p>I also think the Startup scene here is especially small, and full of the kind of people you should avoid.  If you really want to meet the kind of people that will help you and are doing innovative things you need to head to Brooklyn or hunt them down.  They are not at New York Tech MeetUp or any of the other startup events.  Most people doing interesting things (I am only doing somewhat interesting things) are doing them off the radar.  The people you hear about are kind of like the football players from High school - everyone knows about them, but they don't really amount to anything.<p>If your doing a startup in NYC, you should surround yourself with other interesting people outside the tech community.  Meet people from Fashion, Music, Art, Advertising, PR, Marketing, ect. NY has so much to offer - the key is not to get stuck in the tech community.  NY is all about expanding your horizons, and that is truly the benefit of starting a business here.",1264058467

Instead, I argue that the thar mentality causes poverty, and causes or certainly reinforces the oppression in the society.""<p>the author then goes out to enumerate scenarios to argue how thar mentality might cause poverty.<p>I agree, thar mentality can cause poverty. But again, poverty can cause thar mentality. Imagine you are poor destitute. All you probably have to defend is your honor, or that your wife (if u are lucky to have one) is not doing someone else.<p>In the end, I dont know if thar mentality. causes poverty or vice versa. Maybe, they are both caused by some other factor. What I do know is that the Author needs to do a better job than this, Unless all he wants is to appease western cultural supremacists. In that case, he is doing exactly the right thing.",1198742399

""We have to throw that out there in order to deal with the mass amount of information on Digg,"" says Adelson, adding that with such personalization, ""your profile page will be much more interesting to you on the first view.""<p>I hope this encourages Reddit to fix their own recommended page.",1198741908

It's almost like the banks are using a flawed implementation of lisp which executed for-each when asked for map!  Sorry, I couldn't resist... :)<p>I think production and technology do matter, and will eventually be the mechanism by which we bootstrap the next credit cycle.  When wealth is scarce and people can just barely scrape by, who survives?  Those who invent and innovate so people can have better lives for the same price.  When you get right down to it, the only ways to do that are through new technology and more efficient production.<p>It's true that much of the credit for our debt party is going away, and many people could suffer as a result.  And you are correct that in the near term technology and production will not save us, but it is the only way to recover in the long term.",1198741358

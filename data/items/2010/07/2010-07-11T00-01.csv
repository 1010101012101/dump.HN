1504616,comment,1504391,1504391,0,0,philwelch,,,"For those curious about the life and times of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the formative years of analytic philosophy, and an intriguing incident which took place at Cambridge in 1946, I would highly recommend the book <i>Wittgenstein's Poker</i> by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. It begins:<p><i>On the evening of Friday, 25 October 1946 the Cambridge Moral Science Club--a weekly discussion group for the university's philosophers and philosophy students--held one of its regular meetings....That evening the guest speaker was Dr. Karl Popper, down from London to deliver an innocuous-sounding paper, ""Are There Philosophical Problems?"" Among his audience was the chairman of the club, Professor Ludwig Wittgenstein, considered by many to be the most brilliant philosopher of his time. Also present was Bertrand Russell, who for decades had been a household name as a philosopher and radical campaigner.</i><p>...<p><i>This was the only time these three great philosophers--Russell, Wittgenstein, and Popper--were together. Yet, to this day, no one can agree precisely about what took place. What is clear is that there were vehement exchanges between Popper and Wittgenstein over the fundamental nature of philosophy--whether there were indeed philosophical problems (Popper) or merely puzzles (Wittgenstein). These exchanges instantly became the stuff of legend. An early version of events had Popper and Wittgenstein battling for supremacy with red-hot pokers. As Popper himself later recollected, ""In a surprisingly short time I received a letter from New Zealand asking if it was true that Wittgenstein and I had come to blows, both armed with pokers.""</i><p>From there it discusses the lives of Popper and Wittgenstein, from their early years in Vienna to their time in England and the ideas of those places and times, up to and including the famous clash between the two in Cambridge.",1278808195

Things like Oracle db drivers, using ""gem install"" behind a ntlm network proxy were some roadblocks that I ran into with Ruby in a locked down enterprise environment. If you are going to be writing code and running your own servers then Ruby is easier to work with. I still think there is a cultural clash with Ruby in larger/more traditional IT shops.",1278807504

I see links to the most random crap ever.<p>Why is it so hard to apply some sort of affinity metric to the advertising problem?<p>The sad truth is that if Reddit doesn't advertise, if the developer time is simply spent putting out fires, then it will end up being an irrelevant property. There is an amazing community there, which is a credit to what the site has managed so far, but that community will simply migrate to a better platform. It happened with Digg, it happened with Slashdot, and sadly it is inevitable that it will happen to Reddit unless some big changes are made.<p>Although I find many aspects of Facebook to be in outrageously bad taste, or rudely invasive, the one thing they've managed to do as a company is grow, build out, and become highly profitable. There are a lot of things Facebook does that are worth studying in meticulous detail, deconstructing and re-implementing, from their process, to their features, to their strategy to maintain growth. Their capability to execute on complicated technical problems is spectacular.<p>If Conde is unwilling to invest, maybe the best plan is to seek investors to buy out the property and make it an independent venture that's more focused on the site.",1278807036

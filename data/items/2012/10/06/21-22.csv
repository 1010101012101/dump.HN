Hurray!<p>Our company is called theory11 - the largest instructional magic site. We also make really high-end, designer playing cards. Having a crew of magic experts, and friends that work with James Randi, we were asked to collaborate on a viral site promoting the new film ""Red Lights"" with Robert De Niro, Cillian Murphy, and Sigourney Weaver.<p>The film is about a team of two physicists that defraud fake psychics, who claim to have powers to speak to the dead, cure cancer, and levitate. Our idea was to create a viral site that allowed you to freak out your friends (by secretly being our ""informant"") while simultaneously promoting the film and reminding people that there's more than meets the eye.<p>Because this is HN, I wanted to extend huge kudos to MailGun, Twilio, David Kwong, Mark Garity, Millennium Entertainment, and the guys at Les Avignons in Austria for their help with design and development. This was a great challenge that came together in two weeks from start to finish.

4621868,comment,4621638,4621638,1,0,birken,,,"I'd be slightly more careful about making the claim you are making (though in your defense, nearly every person who makes a boastful post about their A/B testing is makes the same mistake).<p>For starters, you are picking an incredibly noisy metric, taking the maximum observed conversion and the minimum observed conversion and then dividing them.  To better illustrate this, I wrote a little test script to simulate what you did many times.  It assumes you have 4 email variations, send 125 emails each, and the average conversion rate is 5% across the buckets.  Then it takes the minimum converting bucket, the maximum converting bucket, and divides them.  Then does that 10k times and averages out what the gain would be by this metric, which is ~2.7x (code here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3846278"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3846278</a>).  2.7x is a lot, but of course in this example it is pure noise, every single bucket converts exactly the same over the long term.<p>This metric also is particularly unhelpful because your goal is to have one high converting email.  The metric you have chosen will be artificially boosted if you happen to have one horribly converting email.  While that is potentially interesting fodder in just how differently various emails can convert, having one horrible email doesn't help you very much.<p>A better way for you to do this analysis is to dump your raw results into a mathematically sound A/B test calculator (I'm a bit of a homer but I don't think you can beat ABBA [<a href=""http://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba/]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba/]</a>), then look at the confidence conversion ranges of the various emails and only make claims based on that.  Like... I tried 4 versions of email copy and got my conversion rate up to X% (+/- some hopefully small confidence interval)!  One of the emails was a real stinker and only converted at Y% (+/- confidence interval), thankfully I A/B tested first and didn't end up getting stuck with that one!",1349560419

4621827,comment,4620276,4620685,11,0,colinb,,,"The first project; the one that finished nearly on time, ran for three or four years. I joined half way through as a crispy graduate. It came in within a couple of weeks of schedule. It seemed very well managed for the whole of time on it. The project manager left that company, and went to work for Apple. When I googled him just now, all the top hits where at Microsoft. Perhaps he knows how to do software engineering. Or perhaps he got lucky that time. I don't know which.<p>The project developed a new CPU architecture, several variant implementations and ported several operating systems to that architecture. Amongst the more impressive feats I saw during that project:<p>- a compiler from assembler of architecture A to assembler of architecture B. This was necessary because we had a lot of code [~10^6 lines] in architecture A assembler\n- several other compilers that handled code written for A, with no thought to portability, and produced asm for B.\n- a modular emulation environment. Initially it ran on a larger example of A that had a programmable microcode feature. Later it was ported to other examples of A. Some of my colleagues were in the room when the ported OS first booted on a machine of type A with the funky microcode. As I recall, it took most of a day to reach the banner.\n- my own part was very modest, but I had fun. Amongst other things, I ported a disk checking utility [think fsck] from A to B. That was easy. To test it I had to create bad blocks for it to find. So I got a SCSI 1.44 floppy drive [!], and a box of new disks. Then I formatted and  scratched each disk with a paperclip, and did a disk copy.<p>So, that was lots of bucks, hundreds of software engineers, and some number of hardware people. I don't know how many of the latter were involved. But remember that nearly everything was custom; CPUs obviously, boards, buses [though that was fixed eventually], bent metal, power supplies. The lot.<p>That was one fairly large company.<p>I've done other large projects that had many cooperating companies, usually with one or two large partners and a number of small outfits. Those involved similar sums, but a large part of that was in the equipment deployment, land purchase and so on. Not so much fun. I did once crash the wireless data network of New Zealand because a radio [or possibly an antenna] came loose on a mast and flapped around in the wind. Every time it swept through 120 degrees, all the effected clients channel hopped, provoking an exciting synchronisation bug in my multithreaded code.<p>Oh, and I got paid for all of it. Not as much as I would if I'd become a banker [though it's presumptuous to assume I _could_ become a banker]. I'd quite like the money, but then again I have more fun that the bankers I know. I've built software that was used [and is used] by fairly large numbers of people [if you're reading this, then you're one of them]. This is satisfying. Even it I can't call it 'engineering' with a clear conscience. If computer programming hadn't been invented, I don't know what would have become of me. There aren't that many other occupations for people with my particular blend of what I'll call talents. If you fall into that category too, then get your laughs while you can. You're a lucky person right now.<p>[and since it behoves me to actually answer the question, I've never done any work for a government or defence contractor. I've no particular objection, it just hasn't come along]",1349559771

I havent heard that any statenot even Texas, which sponsored development of the examhas changed its engineering practice laws or regulations.<p>If and when such changes are made, I expect the result would be something like the situation for electrical engineers now: a nominal requirement for licensure coupled with broad exemptions that make it practically irrelevant for most people working in the field.<p>In most states, only a licensed (registered) engineer may use the title electrical engineer, practice electrical engineering, or offer electrical engineering services to the public, but there is usually a so-called industrial exemption from these requirements; this section of the California Business and Professions Code is typical:<p><pre><code>  6747.  (a) This chapter, except for those provisions\n  that apply to civil engineers and civil engineering,\n  shall not apply to the performance of engineering work\n  by a manufacturing, mining, public utility, research\n  and development, or other industrial corporation, or\n  by employees of that corporation, provided that work\n  is in connection with, or incidental to, the products,\n  systems, or services of that corporation or its\n  affiliates.\n   (b) For purposes of this section, employees also\n  includes consultants, temporary employees, contract\n  employees, and those persons hired pursuant to third-\n  party contracts.\n</code></pre>\nAs I understand it, this exemption exists because employers convinced the Legislature that corporate liability, including strict liability for product defects, would be an adequate substitute for licensure as a means to protect the public from professional incompetence.<p>Practically speaking, the only electrical engineers who must have licenses are those designing electric power systems for buildings or working for public utilities, which often choose to employ only licensed engineers in positions of responsibility, even when this is not legally required.<p>As a licensed engineer myself, Im not sure this state of affairs is best for the public or for the engineering profession, but Im also not convinced that software engineering, as a discipline, is sufficiently mature that even a nominal requirement for licensure would provide enough real benefits to justify the burden on practitioners.",1349559546

Although best practices and standards have been established for electrical systems and mechanical systems, my observations in factory control show that the programming components continue to be the most fragile and buggy. And currently the legislation here lags as well since software systems are typically __not__ certified, except in certain military cases.<p>This isn't something for Web 2.0 programmers, who can carry on as they have been doing. Instead, it's for folks like myself who have designed the clean-room door locking logic for the CDC when contamination is detected (see ""Walking Dead"" for a grossly exaggerated example of such a system).",1349557432

4621699,comment,4621268,4621268,10,0,digikata,,,"Two comments. To me providing good estimates for a single task below a half a day seems like a pointless exercise in estimation. It feels like below that threshold you're working in a micro-management environment where the task tracking is taking away from time-on-task getting things done.<p>For planning larger projects of multiple man years, I think the threshold is even higher for productive estimation. In those long term planning situations estimates below a half a week to a week are more appropriate, because you'll get a better plan focusing on improved requirement specs or use cases etc. This is because the uncertainty of the project completion is better reduced not via better estimates, but better definitions of the tasks or developing a better feel for the technical uncertainties leading you to better estimates. A more precise estimate is not the same as a more accurate estimate.<p>The second comment I'd have is that the most frequent mismatch in estimates is that programmers instinctively estimate the time narrowly focused on implementation, or the time for getting over the hump of the core problem (subconsciously I think thats because after that's done it's boring stuff that few people want to dwell upon). The estimation fix is to separately estimate design and or implementation separate from testing (fixing) and deployment. A good rule-of-thumb there is that testing and deployment will be Pi times the implementation estimate. That factor is even higher if you have a complex multi-layer subsystem / system integration testing scheme required for the project. There are so many shops that like to pretend none of this exists, and they can even manage to succeed doing that, but there's a lot of bad side effects. They're not as effective long-term, often implode after rolling that dice too many times, or will depend on the technical side to grind it out with heroic measures.",1349557382

So, now, as standard practice, when I set up forwarding between GMail accounts, I add a single filter to the account being forwarded:<p><pre><code>    Matches: -96f0f0036730a7d970a678e8f933e8b7\n    Do this: Never send it to Spam\n</code></pre>\nThe string is just a random hex string, the minus (-) tells it to match all messages that do not contain this string. No message should ever contain it, so no message should ever be sent to spam in the original account. Once it gets to the end account, GMail will still filter it and put it in Spam if it is spam.",1349557376

Earlier this year I did the full tour of Sand Hill Road and ultimately raised an A round led by Andreessen Horowitz, considered by many entrepreneurs to be the ""top"" fund today (whatever that means). The top funds tend to have strikingly competent and professional admins. I don't know who you've pitched, but I don't see any particular evidence of your claim about youth and beauty.<p>That's not why I'm downvoting you though. I'm downvoting you because you used the phrase ""past her best"" to refer to women that you don't find attractive. The time when that kind of language was acceptable in our industry has long passed (actually it was never acceptable, only tolerated.) This is a topic that is frequently discussed on HN, and as a HN reader of over a year, you have no excuse for not being on notice.",1349557329

They seem to learn to cope with whatever they can get and learn not to expect much.<p>And I have a theory: there's a group of people who have picked up patterns from a bunch of examples they've found on the Internet, or in code they've managed to be allowed to work on, and they've never grown past that. They're fine as long as you're asking them to do something they've seen or done before (for generous definitions of fine), but completely screwed the moment you venture out of that zone and consulting the Internet draws a blank. They can memorize patterns, but haven't learned to think through anything more complicated than that.<p>These people can appear productive to the right people, yet be completely stumped by FizzBuzz.",1349557299

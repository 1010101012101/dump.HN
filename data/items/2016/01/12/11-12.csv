But I think people normally do that by adding a link tag to the DOM, so it should use browser caching as usual.<p>The other caveat is that the nature of generating common bundles automatically means that what&#x27;s in those bundles will vary whenever the code is changed. This means that you&#x27;ll lose the benefits of browser caching each time you release. If you have dependencies that you can guarantee will be in the common bundle (like it&#x27;s safe to say React will always be in it, along with any other architectural libraries), then you&#x27;re better off externalising them to somewhere that sticks around between releases (and therefore benefits more from browser caching).

So why is it that prices of n-core CPUs seem to be growing linearly with n?<p>Is it because demand is higher for CPUs with low core-counts? I understand this argument in the consumer PC space, but what about in the datacenter?<p>Maybe companies which operate datacenters are too focused on horizontal scalability and stopped caring about vertical scalability? Surely this will change in the future? There are factors like power consumption and floor realestate to consider - From an electricity and realestate perspective, it is increasingly efficient to run your software on as few machines as possible (each machine having more CPU cores).<p>Am I right to believe that eventually companies will start writing/using software which leverages multiple CPU cores (when the cost benefits outweigh the hassle)?<p>Why is it not popular to scale both horizontally AND vertically?<p>I would be really interested in hearing ideas.<p>I started thinking about this after noticing that Amazon EC2 instance prices grew linearly as you doubled memory and CPU resources...

If something happens to one person, than this person gets the teapot. So, it is a little like a lottery, but with the assumption that you will hopefully never win the price. That would mean, you never had an incident.<p>This general principle is already violated, when insurance companies tweaked that system to give some people within that bunch an advantage. This advantage is given by demographics (young vs. old; male vs. female; ethnic; experience; …) to those some people. That means, that all those others will have a disadvantage.<p>Now, this technology provides another possibility to tweak the rules, to give some people an advantage over others. That system is tweaked so long, until you have one person who will definitely pay for nothing. That means, this person is separated from the pool and pays for nothing. Because the pool still pay to cover up their ass and when something happens, it will be paid out of their pool.<p>I hope you can see the spiral.

10886688,comment,10886068,10886343,0,0,tallanvor,,,"A person having different needs than yours isn&#x27;t madness.<p>Many of us here work from home at times, either occasionally or regularly, and we have our own projects in addition to our day job.  We each make our own decisions as to what configuration gives us the most acceptable level as performance given the level of risk we&#x27;re willing to accept.<p>If a couple of drives in a RAID1 configuration works for you, great!  It doesn&#x27;t fit my needs since my media PC has about 20TB of usable space (~15TB in use) and I don&#x27;t want to have to hunt through backups of any form when I want to watch or listen to something.<p>I also have a NAS for my more important files.  It&#x27;s backed up to a cloud provider as well, but the amount of time it would take to download everything after a failure would be very stressful for me, so I spent a bit of money up front for my setup.  It&#x27;s not 100% protection, but so far I&#x27;ve had two drives start to fail, but I was notified in plenty of time to get new drives in and let the array rebuild.<p>I&#x27;m happy with my setup.  Well, happy based on the amount of money I was willing to put into it, obviously.<p>Either way, my setup isn&#x27;t madness.  It&#x27;s simply different than what you do.",1452596931

After that point, too much structure becomes its own kind of hindrance, where you&#x27;re looking at a UI and wondering &quot;What the hell cascades do I have going on here to make that two pixels too far to the right?&quot; (Or something like that)<p>So I don&#x27;t think we disagree. The only thing I&#x27;m adding is that to determine the right amount of structure, add it in only as needed. So I imagine by the time you got to a multi-page site you&#x27;d be using external stylesheets and common classes. You just wouldn&#x27;t start there.<p>Sure do like me some Bootstrap, though. And a good reset sheet is a no-brainer. Need to think about this some more. I think the key question is: how much of this do you really need?<p>For instance, right now I&#x27;m writing a small personal app to take a movie script in native file format and display it as a web page. Where did I start? With the function to do the translation, of course. Now that it&#x27;s working, I can always manually execute it if I need to. I may just stop here. I&#x27;ve done enough.<p>If I really, really want something I can upload scripts to online, I&#x27;ll write a page. Or two. Then I&#x27;ll throw my uploaded file at my pre-existing function, return the file name, and I&#x27;m done.<p>I may have spent 10 hours on this so far.<p>By contrast, the &quot;old&quot; way of doing it was to start with setting up a site using all sorts of frameworks. Maybe decide on a color scheme. On the back-end side, I&#x27;d be creating a class graph and working through my persistence strategy. Maybe I could use Mongo! Wouldn&#x27;t Ruby be awesome?<p>I tend to easily get focused on tooling and technique instead of just doing the fucking work. (Apologies for the profanity, but this took me a long time to figure out). So I&#x27;ve discovered for my own work, I need to concentrate on making sure I grow only the needed complexity. Nothing more. Way too easy for me to screw up in this area.<p>In the case of my little app, sure, I could start adding frameworks. Or I could just emit some HTML. Who knows? Maybe plain HTML with a few classes and some style information in the HEAD might be fine. That&#x27;s a win.",1452596586

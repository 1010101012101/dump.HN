You do need to be careful to ensure you mount volumes or everything that needs to persist, but in practice that&#x27;s not a very onerous limitation.<p>Since volumes are bind-mounted from the outside, you can put the volumes on whatever storage pool you want that you can bring up on the host (as long as it meets your apps requirements, e.g. POSIX semantics, locking etc).<p>E.g. at work we have a private Docker repository that runs on top of GlusterFS volumes that are mounted on thehost and then bind mounted in as a volume in the container.<p>I also run my postgres instances inside Docker, with the data on persistent volumes.<p>We could certainly use better tools to manage it, though.<p>Another pattern I ought to have mentioned (that I&#x27;ve used myself) is to set up &quot;empty&quot; containers whose only purpose is to act as a storage volume for another container. I don&#x27;t like that as much, mostly since I&#x27;ve not had as much long-term experience with how the layering Docker uses would impact it.",1413986372

These are among the reasons privacy and data protection really matter, but to the extent that anyone is really questioning laws and practices today they seem more hung up on Facebook and Google mining data to serve ads.<p>It is rational to worry about something proportionally to the product of how bad it would be and the probability of it happening to you. Getting drone-striked would be worse than losing a job because of data mined from your online presence, but the latter is orders of magnitude more likely to happen to you.<p>Privacy does matter.

The context is a bit more complicated than Hungary doing business with Russia, the government probably does need this money as it&#x27;s doing stupid (and counter productive) spending to increase their popularity among the the less educated and the ones who are less willing to think critically. From this perspective, their move is clever: it&#x27;s smoke screen and they can back up later and they win or they don&#x27;t have to back up that much and they also win. The only way for them to lose is if it turns out to be an ignition bomb (much like the plan to cut the trees in park Gezi in Turkey).<p>The move itself, even with an upper cap of 3-10EURs would be devastating and pointing to the wrong direction. Hungary&#x27;s only option to rise would be education and the strengthtening of the IT sector. But that would need at least 10 years of investment and we&#x27;re still only talking about it. BTW, there was a news bite I think on the same day that this utter stupid move was announced, that we should make the IT education stronger, we should teach more IT in elementary school, blah-blah. Sounds like something that should have been (and indeed have been) said in like 2000. Yet nothing happened, apart from <i>cutting back</i> IT classes last year.<p>This is yet another step in the wrong direction. Totally wrong direction.<p>Oh, and the context: the national tax authority has been known and proven to support criminals who stole around 30M EUR of VAT/yr. It&#x27;s been in the news, nothing happened. Then the idiots tried to force a US company to pay them (high ranking officials of the tax authority) to launch attacks on the competition of the said US company.

It is after all having to place floats at the top and bottom of the page only, or if necessary on a whole separate float-only page, while using no more than \topfraction of each page at the top, \bottomfraction of each page at the bottom, and ensuring there is at least \textfraction of each page left to text.

8492500,comment,8488955,8491552,0,0,bane,,,"Thanks for responding.<p>I can&#x27;t provide insight into the dislike for everybody, but I can speak for people like myself.<p>University for me was an educational privilege and I honestly really went there just to learn. Social activities were a very distant third in terms of what I wanted out of school. Along the way I made many friends in the classes I took, people who were also there for similar reasons. We self-organized into study groups and helped each other with course selection etc.<p>If we just wanted to hang out, we did that also.<p>Quite a few of those people have stayed life-long friends. So the social-network aspects of fraternities always seemed kind of unimportant to me as I left college with a pretty robust social network. It&#x27;s simply not an appealing pitch to join.<p>I know there&#x27;s stories of people who went to the same fraternity recognizing each other&#x27;s 20 year old rings in an interview and getting a job or some similar scenario, but that too seems like a scenario I&#x27;d rather not be involved in. I&#x27;d like to be hired and I hire based purely on job qualification, not having a shared hazing history. Again, not an appealing pitch.<p>> I got what I wanted out of it (my wife).<p>As it turns out, quite a few of my friends (including myself) also found their spouses in college, outside of the greek system. As it turns out people find ways to socialize without the need for a structured system. I&#x27;m glad it worked out for you, but it&#x27;s not really appealing to people like me.<p>> You have access to tons of events with good looking sorority members every week which increases the likelihood that you&#x27;ll get somewhere with someone. You meet so many different women your head spins, the odds are just in your favor.<p>And I think you hit the nail on the head. It seems to people like me that frats really serve no purpose except providing yet another form of the meat grinder bar scene, except <i>probably</i> under drinking age (so doing it illegally) and looking for hookups. Which is fine I guess if you need that sort of semi-structured environment, but again that&#x27;s not what I or any of the people I hung out with in college went to college for.<p>And let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, I attended enough frat parties hosted by my friend&#x27;s frats at various other schools that I&#x27;m well aware of the amount of underage drinking and rampant drug use that goes on inside of the greek system. Not saying it doesn&#x27;t happen outside of the system too, but if I were campus cop looking to make my quota for the month, all I have to do is park outside of the nearest frathouse any night of the week and I&#x27;ll find something illegal to make an arrest on. Property destruction, fights, theft, drugs, rape, illegal drugs and drinking, all happen at fraternities at rates that far exceed what you&#x27;ll find just about anywhere else on any campus. That&#x27;s the &quot;special&quot; treatment that people complain about. Yeah sure there are the twice a year symbolic busts, but if anybody was really concerned about what was going on at the local frat house, all the cops would have to do is come stand outside for 5 minutes during a party and they&#x27;d have probable cause on something to take action. But they don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s understood that they don&#x27;t do it.<p>I remember when I attended my first frat party. I was in a long gap between highschool and college, and one of my friends invited me to come hang out at his school. He had joined a fraternity and managed to get a room in the fraternity&#x27;s house. I remember the smell the most, but we made it to the party and a local, very bad DJ was providing the tunes, every third song was the Verve&#x27;s &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; which had become some kind of de facto song for the frat so every time it played, every member of the frat stood up and sang it. Apparently this song was played multiple times per day every day and had been so for the entire semester. I was sick of it after the 3rd play. It&#x27;s a social event, so I talked to people, while I was there a drunk out of her mind freshman and I started chatting it up. It quickly devolved into her bawling her eyes out while telling me about how her father used to hit her. After a few minutes of this, she asked if I wanted to go back to my room with her (she thought I was in the frat). I declined, she shrugged and went to go start over the same sad scene with another guy.<p>The rest of the party, and all the other frat parties at other schools and frats I&#x27;ve ever attended were basically similar.<p>The house was a mess, it reeked from one of the bongs that were constantly being smoked, one of the rooms was designated the &quot;trip room&quot; for people wanting to do hallucinogenics in a safe place. Animals live in nicer environments. There were parts of the building that clearly weren&#x27;t up to code. There was a pool table in the basement we went to go play on for a while. But it was so old the cue ball literally shattered into pieces after a few hits.<p>Naked and half-naked girls were running around everywhere, the &quot;tie on the dorknob&quot; sign was every third door. My friend and his girlfriend ended up screwing each other while they thought I slept on the floor nearby in his room one night. Yeah, I can see that being fun for a while, but it also should get <i>old</i> after the upteenth time.<p>I never saw anybody doing anything that even remotely resembled studying.<p>At the end of the weekend he looked at me and was like &quot;why don&#x27;t you come to school here and join my frat, isn&#x27;t this great?&quot;<p>I thought he may have been suffering from some kind of brain damage.<p>This is all well and good in college I guess. You&#x27;re young and allowed to experiment and &quot;find yourself&quot; and whatever. But the problem is that this lifestyle ends at some point. You graduate and go on to life. But for some frat guys they think it doesn&#x27;t end. They never want to leave the parties, the easy nightly fucking, the parties, and all the rest -- and oh yeah, the parties. They find themselves in some mid-level corporate management job, or managing a startup, and mistake <i>every</i> social situation, even work ones, as an extension of what they experienced in their Greek life. They <i>think</i> that because they belonged to a social club for four years and nailed lots of girls that they know how to navigate every kind of social exchange.

He actually makes valid points.<p>The internet and globalization as a whole open possibilities for less developed countries. At the same time, they are often exposing their markets to competition they simply cannot compete with at this point.<p>The common argument is, that these countries should open up, catch up in education and participate in the next wave of innovation (e.g. skip the web, go directly to mobile) or learn from the faults of the first movers (e.g. European cc-payments requiring pin).<p>But when we look at the country arguably profiting the most from globalization, China, we find that it is massively protecting its market by requiring joint ventures with local companies and blocking internet-based companies, which could circumvent these measurements.<p>These points do not mean, that taxing internet traffic is the right thing to do, it just means, that not all regulations are bad. You have to look carefully at each industry. In Germany taxis are strongly regulated. Drivers get special trainings, the cars have to be checked more often than regular cars, a taxi has to accept every passenger and so on. I support them fighting Uber, which ignores these regulations and is trying to build a monopoly by competing on price. And monopolies are bad for workers and in the end customers, even if Peter Thiel wants to sell a book.<p>Edit: His parent comment is now dead, but you can get the context out of nightcrackers answer.",1413983446

I took that advice to heart, and from that day on, I told myself that I would try to smile all-the-time.<p>Well, fast forward a couple of decades, and I can honestly say that that is the one piece of advice that has stuck with me all of these years. The results were instant and measurable. People, in general, treated me differently...better. My social awkwardness faded to but a memory.

I think google wallet, square, and other RFID/NFC technologies are thinking about the future, where our devices are consolidated and integrated with the world around us.<p>That&#x27;s like, his opinion, man. I personally think that cards are going to be around for a very long time whether we want them to be or not; for one simple reason: infrastructure. There are just too many card readers in the wild to feasibly displace the technology. For example, I can&#x27;t use Google Wallet in South Africa (even though I would love to be able to) because we simply don&#x27;t have NFC paypoints here. I doubt there will ever be. Dynamic cards seem like a really clever compromise in the direction of that &quot;perfect world,&quot; and when I say &quot;world&quot; I mean it - cards are a world-wide technology. NFC is not.<p>The author clearly has a problem drawing a line between what is feasible and what he wants. We probably all want NFC payments - the reality is that most of the world won&#x27;t get them.<p>If you really think about it all Coin are doing is creating a compatible addon for existing card reader that let you use NFC (or BLE, but the technologies are similar) with any of them.<p>> Legality of preordering<p>I am struggling to figure out how exactly this argument means that the cards are a step in the wrong direction.

If you put it outside the module, you break the modularity. If you put it inside, well then you might as well make the functions monadic in the first place. Basically if you have functions in module API (which may be in itself pure) that may eventually end up calling unpure functions, you have to provision for that somehow, either in the module by making them monadic, or in the caller via lifting. Either way, it&#x27;s not as clean as it could be.<p>But I thought about it some more, and to me it seems that actually parametrizing the functions to outside world is not that bad; it&#x27;s a kind of dependency injection, and seems fine.

Cover price was on the order of 2.35, so you could expect revenue of 317,000-odd per issue <i>from paid subscribers/store customers</i>. Around 120 pages consisted of editorial content, plus up to 550 pages of advertising. (This ratio holds in the US, too, where to take advantage of printed matter bulk postal rates magazines had to have no less than 20% editorial content mixed in with the ads.)<p>I don&#x27;t have exact revenue figures, but a half-page black and white ad in CS sold at the time for roughly 2000. So, ignoring the premium for colour and blow-in ads, we can approximate the advertising revenue to 2.2M per issue. In actual fact, colour ads sold for a <i>lot</i> more, so the revenue per issue would be closer to 3M.<p>The take-home here is that at most 14% of the magazine&#x27;s revenue came direct from the readers -- indeed, the readers were probably getting the colourful 650-page object for the cost of printing alone. The remaining 86% -- or more -- of the magazine&#x27;s revenue came from advertising.<p>Now, from a business perspective, whose interests do you expect to weigh more heavily on the mind of the publisher -- the readers, or the advertisers?",1384510370

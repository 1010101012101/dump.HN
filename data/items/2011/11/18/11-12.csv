3251447,comment,3250093,3251259,8,0,lisper,,,"You're thinking of the wrong kind of relativity.  The neutrinos aren't ""bound"" to any frame.   They just move from A to B.  The (apparent) distance between A and B changes depending on the observer's frame of reference, as does the (apparent) time it takes them to get from A to B.  The faster the observer goes, the shorter the apparent distance (Lorentz contraction) and the smaller the apparent time (time dilation) become.  But the RATIO of the apparent distance from A to B to the apparent time it takes light to travel from A to B remains constant.  So if the neutrinos are moving faster than light, they will appear to do so as measured from any frame of reference as long as you're consistent about using the same frame to measure time and distance.  THAT is where it gets tricky because the GPS satellites that they use to establish both time and distance are all moving in different frames.  You also have to take gravity into account because the emitter and detector are non-intertial frames.",1321617333

Designers will not use a format not supported by the majority of browsers and browsers see no need to implement new formats unless people are asking for them.<p>It goes against the web design principle of making your site usable to all users regardless of what they are browsing with to use an image format that is not widely supported. This principle is backed by users who will simply leave your site in disgust if they are asked to jump through hoops to use it. Very few designers will be willing to maintain two versions of all their images just because one of the formats is a bit smaller.<p>Microsoft has it's own range of newish web image formats that never caught on. History suggests IE is unlikely to support anything ""not made here"" unless it is forced to. The competition to Microsoft's image formats, JPEG2000, never caught on either. Firefox has an infamous open bug about adding it in dating back to 2000: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36351"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36351</a> - over 11 years! Despite what it looks like in the last comment, my Firefox 8 still does not have support.<p>The last image format that managed to make it was PNG, and that was almost over a decade ago, although alpha support in PNG was added comparatively recently to IE. Last time I checked MNG (PNG's answer to animated GIFs) still wasn't widely supported.<p>Sorry to be such a downer, lack of support for JPEG2000 was a let down for me. As I see it Firefox, Opera and Safari will all need to support this first, before web designers in general will even consider using it. Only once a significant number of web designers are clamouring for it will IE slowly add support for it. Only then will it see wide use.<p>Tool support is vital too, most importantly Adobe PhotoShop. No web designer I know of is going to muck about in the commandline with imagemagick.",1321616670

This is something other implementers want to stay clear from for now, let alone it gets deployed in the wild and you have massive compatibility issues, or need to bloat all supporting software to support now-long outdated bitstreams (hi Vorbis!).<p>2) ""If Google can encourage Firefox to start supporting it"". Yeah, like they did with WebM, and then completely backstabbing Firefox by never actually removing H.264 support from Chrome, despite claiming to going to do it for many months.

If it was the same number of <i>pixels</i>, I'd maybe swing the other way but generally pentile has been a victim of the fanboy wars because (so far at least) Apple hasn't used it.<p>Though I believe it was rumoured (and frankly would have made engineering sense) for them to use it when they quadrupled the resolution in the iPhone 4 but Samsung couldn't guarantee enough production to fulfil Apple's expected demand. I can easily imagine another world where Apple makes some slick videos explaining the benefits of Pentile and anyone who doesn't have it is mocked, similar to how the iPhone's Retina Display, which they admit <i>in the very name</i> goes beyond the point of visibility in normal use is considered the minimum benchmark for a good screen.",1321614393

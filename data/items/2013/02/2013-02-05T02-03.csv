I agree people aren't likely to spontaneously change their behavior just because someone tells them there is a catastrophic problem looming; they will need much harder evidence than that, and on the hypothesis that there is a catastrophic problem looming, by the time there is hard evidence it will probably be too late.<p>However, that doesn't make centralized schemes look any better, because on the hypothesis that there is a catastrophic problem looming, the schemes will have to be so drastic and so draconian that to say they will be gamed is a massive understatement. The sorts of relatively mild things that are being proposed, like a carbon tax or cap and trade schemes, won't stop a catastrophic problem. We would have to massively re-engineer the world's entire economy. And nobody knows how to do that, so even if we tried a centralized scheme, it wouldn't work; we'd be at least as badly off as if we'd hoped people would spontaneously change their behavior.<p>(The above is all irrelevant anyway, because we already know we can't re-engineer the world's entire economy; China and India and the rest of the developing world won't let us.)<p>If there is a catastrophic problem looming, the best we can do is to try to figure out how to adapt. If sea levels are going to rise, build levees. If agriculture is going to have to shift to different areas of land, work on how best to shift it. Or figure out how to induce cooling to offset the warming--for example, by pumping aerosols into the upper atmosphere to simulate a volcanic eruption, since those are known to have a cooling effect. (To me, trying to induce cooling is more risky than adapting, because I'm not convinced we understand the climate well enough to predict the effects. But since we do have past data on volcanic eruptions, we can at least use that as a benchmark if we were desperate enough to try such a scheme.)<p><i>I think you're claiming that Al Gore's bona fides as an objective judge are compromised by his profit opportunity</i><p>That's certainly not the only reason I think Al Gore isn't an objective judge. I just point it out as an example of the sorts of conflicting interests that are in play in any centralized scheme.<p>As far as Gore being sincerely worried about the problem, I think he is, but it's hard to be sure, just as it's hard to be sure with any politician. In any case, whether or not his worry is sincere is irrelevant; people can be perfectly sincere and still game the system, because they don't see what they're doing as gaming the system. The very fact that their beliefs are sincere makes it harder for them to do that; they think their beliefs are just reality, since that's how sincere beliefs present themselves to the human mind, so they don't even bother exercising critical thinking about them.",1360032950

So you will have $5000 added to your 1040 and taxed on it.<p>If you do contact the debt company and make arrangements to pay you will be contacted by other debt companies as well. So that 1K down payment and $X month, the other debt companies will want a settlement as well.<p>What you might want to do is contact a debt settlement company that can consolidate your debts into one monthly payment. Your credit rating is already ruined by owing debt and being sued. Contact a debt lawyer or debt consolidation company to reduce or consolidate the debt and make payments if you want to go that route.<p>Owing debt and taxes is all too common in the software consultant area. Sometimes software consultants are stiffed by contracting companies, clients, brokers, etc and still have to pay taxes on income they earned but were not paid for. If they ask about your income changing, just tell them it was higher when you had more work and it adjusts to the market. Most credit card or debt companies don't care what you earn, as long as you make payments. They will eventually see your tax form and then make adjustments to your credit based on that. Debt collection companies, by the way, get your contact info from the IRS from what you put on your 1040 form. So whatever contact phone or contact postal address you list, they will contact you with that. Some people skip debt collection agencies by putting a PO box listed as an apartment or a phone number that is always busy or rings and rings and never is answered as their contact phone to keep debt collectors away.

(If you really need citations for this, I'll provide some.) One of the common side-effects of autism spectrum disorders is an impairment in interpreting other people's facial expressions, body language, and vocal tones.<p>When I mentioned the romcom stuff, it wasn't because I was arguing that it was a how-to or that nerds couldn't distinguish fiction from reality. It was only there to illustrate that the line between ""creepy"" behavior and behavior that <i>in the ideal sense</i> might be considered ""sweet"" is really blurry, and that it's dependent largely on receptivity of the people involved, and that as a trend, people in software development have a more difficult time correctly interpreting these situations.<p>I could go a lot more in-depth on this. I think there's a lot of very interesting cultural stuff happening in the U.S. (and to a larger extent, Japan) in male-female relations, I think there's a lot of uncertainty now about what constitutes ""attractive"" behavior and what doesn't, and I think that the ability to correctly interpret body language and other subtle cues is the only substantial edge anyone has over other people in this environment.<p>However, none of that should be read as a defense of behavior like posting fake nudge images of someone or outright harassment or any of the other things that women have recently been rightly complaining about. I was only wondering aloud earlier whether the combination of the ratio of men to women in software, combined with social impairment by a significant number of people in the industry, might be contributing to the problem.<p>I'm not really sure what else to say to defend my earlier comment; I honestly wasn't expecting it to be controversial. At this point though, if you'd like to continue to disagree, and you expect me to respond, I'd like for you to at least argue against what I actually write (e.g., I did not say, ""nerds are incapable of 'reading' the difference between fantasy and reality""), and I'd love it if you bundled some kind of insight or evidence with your argument.",1360031785

5168655,comment,5161941,5168187,1,0,javert,,,"I think that a _proper_ definition of ""deregulation"" is ""completely removing regulation."" Anything short of that is ""partial deregulaiton.""<p>I think that many people act as if and/or think that a proper definition of ""deregulation"" is ""reducing regulation.""<p>However, I see no point in arguing about definitions. I propose that we just use the terms ""complete deregulation"" and ""partial deregulation"" from here on out, so as to be non-ambiguous.<p>Given this, let me state my stance on partial deregulation. I thought about stating it earlier, but it seemed just barely too tangential.<p>I think partial deregulation is often much worse than regulation.<p>For example, regulation may take the form of ""Cable company X has the exclusive right to lay coaxial cable in our city. In return, cable company X must allow our city to have our own special channel where we can post public announcements; and, it must lay wire to all areas of the city, regardless of income level; and, it must allow the city to set rates that subscribers can be charged.""<p>Under partial deregulation, X may be allowed to set whatever rates it wants, but still have the exclusive right to lay coaxial cable. So, it can gouge customers.<p>In this case, partial deregulation didn't correct a situation in which the government was overstepping its bounds. It partially corrected it, and in doing so, made things worse.<p>I think this is overwhelmingly the kind of thing that happens with partial deregulation, and I think partial deregulation is overwhelmingly what happens these days when politicians talk about deregulation.<p>Sorry, I know you just wanted me to agree/disagree with your definition rather than adding a bunch of new intellectual content... but I figured the above would be helpful (and likely similar to what you were thinking).",1360031007

It's a fair question. Recall that sexism is discrimination based on sex OR behavior that fosters stereotypical/hurtful attitudes and roles.  The attacker did both here. He attempted to drown out the technical ability of the victim by, during her technical presentation, spamming pictures that quite literally turned her into an object. This is a manifestation of classic behavior where men value women for their appearance only and everything else is ignored. Had that attacker had his/her way, this would have been the reality; all the attention would have been on her appearance and no attention would have been paid towards her technical presentation. His/her goal could not be more clear. To tie the goal back to sexism: what the attacker wanted is both a distinguishing treatment based on her sex (the first definition) AND a behavior that encourages ignoring the technical ability of women in favor of focusing on their appearance (the second definition).<p>I hope this makes my use of the word sexism clear.

5168624,comment,5164202,5167317,2,0,chc,,,"Well, a lot of it is that Lisp uses parens for <i>everything</i> while most other languages use a variety of syntactic tools.<p>For example, declaring a bunch of variables in Lisp:<p><pre><code>  (let ((a 1)
        (b 2)
        (c 3))
    (format t ""They are ~D, ~D and ~D~%"" a b c))
</code></pre>
The same thing in C<p><pre><code>  int a = 1;
  int b = 2;
  int c = 3;
  printf(""They are %d, %d and %d\n"", a, b, c);
</code></pre>
Lisp used parens around the whole construct, as well as around the assignment list, around each individual assignment and to do the printing. C completely eschews some of these parens and uses = and ; to fill essentially the same role as the others. Only `printf()` keeps the parens. In short, C has <i>lots of different syntactic symbols</i>, while Lisp has relatively few.<p>To illustrate further, Clojure gets the ""OMG parens"" complaint a lot less than most Lisps because it consciously shies away from the traditional parens-everywhere look of Lisp. For example, the above code in Clojure:<p><pre><code>  (let [a 1
        b 2
        c 3]
    (printf ""They are %d, %d and %d\n"" a b c))
</code></pre>
Still more parens than C, but the difference is marked  the assignment block is clearly set apart by syntax, and the assignments are paired by juxtaposition rather than by grouping into lists. Parens are used relatively sparingly.<p>This isn't to say that this is really a <i>problem</i>, but the idea that parens in Lisp are equivalent to brackets in C isn't really right either. Parens in Lisp are used in place of nearly <i>every</i> bit of syntax in C, from braces to equals signs to semicolons.",1360030456

Menus. Microsoft office has made ""ribbon"" style interfaces quite popular instead of using menus. But menus had some important features: you could search through them exhaustively (at least the menus that aren't context-sensitive), and you can use the menus to incrementally learn the keyboard shortcuts for the features you use most often.

I remember feeling so alone, so unappreciated, and so completely overwhelmed by the stakes of the game.<p>I remember that they were the best years of my life.<p>10 years later, after reaching the success i craved, the validation, and the confidence of knowing I could do it again, I sold everything and started from scratch.<p>I haven't had an income for 2 years, I've never been in more debt, and I've heard 'no' from hundreds, 'get more customers' from thousands, and been ignored by millions.<p>Also, I've never felt more successful.<p>Entrepreneurship is hard, but that's why I love it.  Everyone expects you to fail, the incumbents build walled gardens, customers want you to work for free, and your friends don't believe you're smart enough, focused enough, or have what it takes.<p>It's our job to stand alone against a crowd, and when the wave of dissent and disbelief has crashed over us, stand steadfast.<p>Our refusal to accept the status quo is an insult to those who have built a life around it, and while they never accept us as one of them, they eventually respect us for refusing to buckle, and join the herd.<p>You said you might take some flack for this article, but you shouldn't.  You described the feelings we all have quite succinctly.  I just hope I can remind you of the other feelings that might keep you focused, and forging ahead.<p>Best of luck.",1360029780

Of course it's political. It involves digging up public/private property under municipal permission. It invokes the same contentious debates that all infrastructure projects invoke: richer neighborhoods versus poor one, urban ones versus rural ones, ""not in my backyard,"" etc. As long as telecom involves digging up public land or using public spectrum, it will be intensely political.",1360029752

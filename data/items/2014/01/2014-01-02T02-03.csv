I&#x27;ve not &quot;reverse-engineered&quot; the base image of my own router like in the article above, because that&#x27;s a lot of work. I&#x27;ve worked on an awful lot of routers, hubs, switches of all sorts, enterprise and consumer. Have been network administrator for a large global company and I think that I can trust my sources.<p>What the <i>new user</i> &quot;blablablaat &quot; mentioned is obvious, I&#x27;m not stupid to make something like this up. Of course I have no &quot;Provider Services&quot; or anything remotely similar enabled, but it&#x27;s still possible to connect to the router and take control over it according to my source and I&#x27;ve seen it back then, when I asked for him/her to show it. Now why, do you expect me to prove that? A security researcher, is more qualified than me to create the convincing report you&#x27;re asking for, sorry. You can feel free to do it yourself too, if you want. It&#x27;s not my intention to spread rumors or FUD, but to make you at least aware of that your router ain&#x27;t secure.",1388631594

6997926,comment,6995020,6995020,1,0,RichardPrice,,,"San Francisco, CA<p>Academia.edu is trying to improve the way that academic publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot; Over 6 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 600k plus join up each month.<p>If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

You can even check in with Foursquare:<p><a href""https://foursquare.com/v/i5-border-patrol-checkpoint--weigh-station/4b626fc9f964a52093472ae"" rel""nofollo"">https://foursquare.com/v/i5-border-patrol-checkpoint--weigh-...</a><p>All cars on the interstate are stopped, any time they feel like it, and searched or not as the Border Patrol desires.  No suspicion exists or need exist.  Most of those stopped have not crossed the Mexican border in years, or ever.  And no, none of it is illegal in any way.<p>Or compare, if you like, the EXIT searches that Customs is now doing at many border crossings - people who are attempting to (but have not yet) exited the United States.  By definition, they aren&#x27;t entering the U.S. and haven&#x27;t crossed any border, but again, they&#x27;re being searched, entirely legally, every day, and woe to you if you attempt to resist, as author (and now convicted felon) Peter Watts will be happy to tell you.<p>Simple rule of thumb: if tptacek says it, you can ignore it.",1388630871

The part on robots rings well, but there was one thing about parenting at the end that rang not so well to my ears:<p>&quot;children grew up more attached to their robot nannies than to their actual parents. This was mitigated by making the robot nannies somewhat severe&quot;<p>This reflects a very simplistic view on who kids love. It is in fact wrong even in the first order: kids actually love more severe parents or severe teachers (obviously, below a severity threshold, I am not talking about sadistic education here).<p>I experienced it myself as a kid: we respected and loved much more the teacher of French litterature, because he was severe and knew how to make himself respected. The German teacher tought the softer she was the better, and she was bullied and hated.<p>I experienced it with my own kids, and with the kids of friends. Each time I am severe with them, e.g. not bending to their will, I gain points in their hearts.<p>If I were to find a way to make kids prefer their parents over their robot nannies, I&#x27;d say we would just let the parents have and show they have the power of decision, and therefore the power of empowerment. From my experience kids love the most those would can empower them doing new things, the ones who will forbid and allow. a personal example is thusly: I forbid my 4yo son to touch my tools, but he is allowed to watch when I&#x27;m fixing something, and sometime I ask him for help (&quot;bring me the screwdriver&quot;) and he is sometime allowed to use some tools when it is safe and supervised.

We present a new way of building high performance interpreters that is particularly effective for executing dynamically typed programming languages. The key idea is to combine speculative staging of optimized interpreter instructions with a novel technique of incrementally and iteratively concerting them at run-time.<p>This paper introduces the concepts behind deriving optimized instructions from existing interpreter instructions---incrementally peeling off layers of complexity. When compiling the interpreter, these optimized derivatives will be compiled along with the original interpreter instructions. Therefore, our technique is portable by construction since it leverages the existing compiler&#x27;s backend. At run-time we use instruction substitution from the interpreter&#x27;s original and expensive instructions to optimized instruction derivatives to speed up execution.<p>Our technique unites high performance with the simplicity and portability of interpreters---we report that our optimization makes the CPython interpreter up to more than four times faster, where our interpreter closes the gap between and sometimes even outperforms PyPy&#x27;s just-in-time compiler.",1388628758

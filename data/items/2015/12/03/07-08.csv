They&#x27;re trying to do something very hard - a natural language system which can handle a conversation with state, and reliably understands its input.  Very, very few systems do that.  Things like Siri and Google Voice Search will punt to giving you a web page when they don&#x27;t understand enough to give a concise answer. Those systems have huge staffs behind them writing rules for special cases.<p>There are commercial products which might make this do-able by a small team. Teneo has a natural language platform good enough for online banking.[1]  It can do a conversation with state, and can handle business logic for the bank&#x27;s services.  Their dress ordering demo is amusing.[2] Not only does it do the order, it tries to sell accessories relevant to the dress. That could work; presenting the buyer with a few well-chosen options at the moment of sale is good sales technique.  Amazon does that with &quot;Others also bought&quot;, but it&#x27;s not as targeted.<p>But no, they&#x27;re trying to do it with open source software and nobody with a clue.  They also seem to have completely missed that they&#x27;ll need a back end system which looks at the results from the natural language system, notes when things didn&#x27;t go well, and can be used to make the system smarter.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwOZaPnJIzQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwOZaPnJIzQ</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.artificial-solutions.com/natural-language-interaction-solutions/natural-language-interface/solutions-for-intelligent-websites-applications-and-web-services/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artificial-solutions.com/natural-language-interac...</a>",1449129422

Allowing Uber to operate in a city where technically only medallion owners were supposed to drive is actually really shitty to the owners of those medallions. You open it up, suddenly tell them that their investment is worthless because of a change in regulations. It&#x27;s really unfair to them. Perhaps the way to quiet the medallion owners would be to pay them like 25% or 50% of what they were worth earlier in compromise bill allowing Uber in. They don&#x27;t feel so slighted, everyone else gets Uber. That&#x27;s win-win.<p>How it would work in this case: pass a compromise bill which involves paying these companies some amount of cash so their shareholders won&#x27;t feel so slighted.

Control effects make it easier to design and implement extensible programs.

If you disagree with that statement, let me know.<p>This is only true if you make a series of very large assumptions about the people involved. Such as that voters individually choose to consume an inclusive variety of media, instead of filtering to just the media that caters to their tribe.<p>This is the sort of assumption that seems easy if you are utopian and don&#x27;t really understand tribalism in nearly-hairless primates. Suffice to say it&#x27;s not nearly as simple as you think and far from the guarantee you clearly believe.<p>> So your argument is that implicit power structures are just as problematic as explicit power structures as you can still have a small number of actors who seek to game the system to their own advantage?<p>Implicit power structures are <i>worse</i>. This is because they lack accountability mechanisms and centralize power, making corruption easy while also making it difficult to get rid of. This is in no way an improvement.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s becoming painfully clear to me that you simply don&#x27;t understand power.<p>> I find that insulting, quite frankly.<p>Bully for you.<p>> As I&#x27;ve said before, none of those societies you&#x27;re referring to were communist societies, nor did they start out as communist societies and devolve into something else. They were never communist to begin with, and did not make efforts to become more communist as time went on.<p>I imagine you think it&#x27;s just a coincidence that without exception, every single historical case wherein sincere attempts at Communism were made the result was a dictatorial bloodbath. You think the examples aren&#x27;t relevant.<p>After all, they were not <i>true</i> Scotsman.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m done with this conversation.

I’m taking a course on it this semester (I’m a masters student in aerospace engineering)–let me summarize some of the problems that your body goes through during space travel.<p>Humans spend about 70% of their time either standing or sitting. That means the human body is optimized for a hydrostatic pressure gradient like the one illustrated here (<a href=""http://wiki.sdstate.edu/@api/deki/files/999/=1-BP_Change.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.sdstate.edu/@api/deki/files/999/=1-BP_Change.png</a>). Blood pressure is much higher at your feet than at your head. In space, however, there is no gravity to produce this gradient, so the cardiovascular system equalizes its pressure. That’s why astronauts suffer from “puffy face” (higher-than-usual fluid pressures in head) and “chicken legs” (lower-than-usual fluid pressures in legs). In their first couple days in space, astronauts lose about 1L of leg volume from each leg.<p>The CV system relies on internal pressure sensors to figure out how to operate, and the new pressure distribution confuses it. Astronauts lose a lot of blood plasma–it sort of ends up absorbed into the surrounding tissues. This increases the relative concentration of red blood cells, which triggers the body to slow down production of new ones. Also, the heart atrophies because it doesn’t need to pump as hard to move liquid around the body.<p>When you come back from space, your body needs to rapidly readapt from microgravity to one gee. It is not very good at doing that. That’s why 63% of astronauts are unable to stand for ten minutes straight just after their return from short-duration space missions (see video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPDST7EePXQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPDST7EePXQ</a>).<p>There are other problems: the cells that are constantly building and destroying your bones fall out of alignment when you’re in microgravity, causing astronauts’ bones to change structure in a way that looks a lot like accelerated aging. Why? Not clear, but possibly related to the lack of repeated loading, as happens when you stand/walk in normal gravity. Astronauts end up with huge concentrations of calcium in their blood, which causes kidney stones. Astronauts in space average around 4 hours of sleep per night, and very few of them eat enough calories to maintain their body weight, so they lose muscle mass.<p>Aerospace medicine is about half medical studies of astronauts and half studies of people on earth. It turns out that you can make most of these body changes happen by having people lie on their backs with the bed tilted down six degrees (head downward). Fascinating field. If you want to know more, I recommend the textbook “Space Physiology” by Jay Buckey (amazon link here: <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Space-Physiology-Jay-C-Buckey/dp/0195137256?tag=s4charity-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smile.amazon.com/Space-Physiology-Jay-C-Buckey/dp/019...</a>).",1449126169

If you raise the tax on carbon, that cost could be passed on by businesses in unexpected ways. If the cost of me shipping vegetables across the country goes up by 2%, I&#x27;m just going to increase what I charge for shipping by at least 2% and the cost could well be passed on directly to consumers. Eventually I might be outcompeted by someone who has a fleet of electric trucks. Maybe, at some point. But until that happens, people could end up paying slightly more than they do now for essentials.<p>Maybe this effect is covered in the policy details or by the term &quot;revenue neutral&quot;.

Because coal gets released right into the atmosphere, while spent fuel rods get stored away from human contact.<p>I know that there are political realities that prevent all of the taxes that should be in effect from coming into effect, but those political realities can change once the issue is reframed.

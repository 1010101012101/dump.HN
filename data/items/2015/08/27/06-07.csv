I&#x27;m not  sure that electrostatic can produce a space engine too. Regular electric generation at best. No, i meant inertial confinement.<p>>A fusion bomb necessarily needs a transient, extreme ignition, which I believe can only be achieved with a fission bomb<p>Inertial confinement doesn&#x27;t really need much energy. It needs huge power, huge energy density (notice that power != energy). Fission primary is the best way to achieve that of course, yet Sandia Z-machine or LNL NIF lasers achieve power enough for ignition too while not spending any noticeable amount of energy (NIF uses old lasers so it consumes more energy than it would if it was built with today&#x27;s lasers). Both devices - Z-machine or a NIF-like with the old lasers replaced by modern solid state ones - are already of the size on the scale of 10-20 shipping containers and are capable of burning something like a grain size pellets which creates neutron flux deadly in the area of the size like that LNL NIF building. To me it seems like there are really great chances that either of them would be miniaturized enough to produce a space engine as well as a weapon (to which our civilization doesn&#x27;t look ready).",1440658615

It&#x27;s strange to see what the various jujitsu-descended arts choose as their comfort level with injury.&quot;<p>I think is not strange. This oscillation is normal. There is a tension in all the martial arts that serious practicants are very aware of.<p>If you practice only the form, where you can practice everything, you are not really practicing, because you are not used to what means a real fight. In the other hand is impossible to practice in a total realistic way because is dangerous and not healthy.<p>The same tension translate to competition. When you start making rules it stop being a real combat, but without rules is impossible to have competition.<p>In the Brazilian Jujitsu combats, for instance, there are a lot of things that are forbidden and you never train for (attack the eyes, break fingers..) but you would find in a &quot;street fight&quot;<p>As the bio mechanics are the same for all the martial arts, we are all humans after all, I think that one of the more important things that determine a martial art &quot;shape&quot; is how it solve this tension between form and combat. The other more important being where your focus is (for instance stand up vs. floor, or grappling vs. punching).<p>What you describe is the natural movement in those axis.",1440656487

The first developer creates the abstraction, and the second developer feels the need to continue with it, and to refactor, despite the fact that it;s not really working. What Sandi does not talk about here is team dynamics, and communications. This is really a root cause of the problem.<p>The barrier for for the second programmer is cost of communication. It is far easier to continue a bad abstraction than to engage in discussion and perhaps arguments about the code the first programmer wrote. Her suggestion, to revert the abstraction and go back to duplication, will most certainly result in a long thread in the code review, or even a heated discussion between the two programmers. That&#x27;s OK, but it assumes the team can handle this situation gracefully.<p>When a programmer spends time to come up with an abstraction, it often takes a lot of mental effort. The resulting code is something that the first programmer feels made everything better. They removed duplication, and they are proud of the new shiny abstraction. Simply reverting it is a big message that says &quot;that was a bad idea&quot;, and is sure to bruise egos.<p>Perhaps the problem of wrong abstractions can be avoided in the first place when a team has a strong code review culture, and when developers pair more. In these teams, code ownership and shared responsibility lead to a lower barrier for making changes to abstractions, which are generally held on to more strongly.<p>In my experience, a codebase that suffers from wrong abstractions (and over-engineering in general) is also a sign that the team is not working well together. Typically one or more programmers are committing code without discussing it, due to bad team dynamics, physical distance, different POV on the project goals, or unhealthy &quot;rockstar&quot; mentalities.",1440655494

Hell, it even doesn&#x27;t have generics, which is considered pretty essential in nowadays&#x27; statically typed languages. And this claim isn&#x27;t an outcome of ignorance.

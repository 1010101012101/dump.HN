10751766,comment,10751234,10751583,0,0,Brakenshire,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert either, but as far I can see:<p>The diagramme showing how much memory is recovered is figure one. White is before the administration of the &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s protein&quot; (AB protein), black is without the new clearing chemical, blue is with it, and then the different blue columns showing different concentrations. Fig 1c is prophylactic treatment (clearing molecule administered before, during and after the AB protein), Fig 1d is clearing molecule administered alongside AB protein. The impairment seems to more or less recover fully back up to where it was originally, in all four combinations of timing and clearing molecule concentration.<p>But bear in mind:<p>* The mouse model for Alzheimer&#x27;s seems to be very, very simplified - as far as I can see they literally inject big doses of these proteins directly into the brain in order to induce Alzheimer&#x27;s like symptoms, that doesn&#x27;t mean this is equivalent at all to the complex chemical processes underlying Alzheimer&#x27;s. AB proteins are observed in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients, but they are also observed in healthy patients, and other proteins are also seen in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients, some of which are recently thought more likely to be the underlying driver of the disease.<p>* All of this occurs over a very short period of time. Someone who has developed symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s will have had the disease process occurring for many years beforehand. Recovery a few days after administration of the protein doesn&#x27;t mean that damage would be recoverable years later.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m actually just looking at the first experiment, they also do longer term trials with a mouse model which has been genetically altered to over-expresses the AB protein. Arguably this is still a very over-simplified model, but it does more to address the time question. They say Alzheimer&#x27;s symptoms usually develop at 5 months, then they administer the clearing molecule at 10.5 months for 3 months. Those experiments shows about half the deficit being recovered relative to normal age-matched mice.",1450364071

10751759,comment,10750293,10751229,0,0,landonshoop,,,"Agreed.  To add to your point:<p>Most entrepreneurs need to spend a significant amount of time thinking about non-tech related objectives (e.g. sales, pricing, marketing, etc).  Sure -- there are tons of publications out there teaching a technical entrepreneur the fundamentals of marketing and sales, but it is always specific to the author&#x27;s/interviewee&#x27;s own experience which happens to be unlike all others. Or, and perhaps more commonly, these publications tend to gloss over a really important fact (or facts): the author/interviewee had insane connections or a very rich uncle that allowed her to achieve success as an entrepreneur/businessperson without an MBA.<p>For those would-be entrepreneurs without insane connections, deep pockets, or a future unicorn in the making, the MBA provides an opportunity to build skills and knowledge important to getting a business off the ground and, more generally, teaches one how to operate in a world that revolves around money, not tech.  Personally, my MBA gave way to a great new career path, higher salary, great connections, and -- most importantly -- a much more holistic view of the world.<p>In the end, I do believe that an MBA is not required for success.  However, I disagree with Thiel and Sandberg drawing such a hard line in the sand.  People looking to learn is never a useless act.<p>For context -- I picked up an EE degree in undergrad and eventually went on to grab an MBA.",1450364001

You want to combine efforts to get legislation through that benefits your constituency even if it&#x27;s a lot more costly than it would be if you could get your measure approved by itself. An example would be Congressman A has a bunch of people complaining about the all the dangerous intersections in their state, Congressman B has a bunch of bridges that are falling apart, so the two get together and create a Federal Road Improvements Act or whatever to appropriate budget for what is now being considered a nation concern. This is a logical place for riders as it allows federal budgeting to have the greatest reach it can for helping the states.<p>There is substantially less logical argument when the riders concern law. From your example, if a law ever put a congressman&#x27;s constituency worse off than they were before, there is no time when that representative should support it. Creating an environment of sweeping bad law into bills set to pass is inherently dangerous because once in place, laws are considered correct until properly invalidated.<p>But the nature of these riders is different still. This is law being thrown into budget. Just like the super controversial sections in the 2012 NDAA, these are mixing two very different types of bills. Having law riders is dangerous enough as it is, but allowing them to be thrown into budgetary bills that must pass is just insane.<p>The problem is there is currently no delineation in congress between the two types of bills. Everything they do whether budgetary or policy based is law and is generally &quot;over the head of us simple minded folk&quot; so they have leveraged a tremendous amount of freedom in the way that they can push things through regardless of how much sense anything they do ultimately makes.<p>I think the first-step solution would be to separate bill types and only allow appropriation riders on budgetary matters and no riders when it comes to new law/policy. If that is too complicated for them, they shouldn&#x27;t be law makers.",1450362821

You need more than one thread, at least, for any of these problems.<p>I strongly suspect that combining async streams will prove to be a problem in practice, whether we resolve glitches or not. This article requires quite subtle reasoning about async systems. In my experience this type of reasoning is rarely done effectively on real life projects.<p>I am not criticising Rx, I am interested in Rx. But I am always concerned when a project/community starts producing articles on very subtle topics and claims &#x27;x isn&#x27;t a problem if you just understand it properly&#x27;. Here properly probably means deeply, and deep knowledge in software is scarce. There are too many things to know, to know many things deeply.<p>Let me look at one example (and please comment if I&#x27;m really not understanding something).<p>So we consume, asynchronously, two streams. Because they are asynchronous we might hit some point where it&#x27;s a bit uncertain where two outputs are related.<p><pre><code>    errors            ---e1----e2------------------\n    userActions       -u1------u2------------u3----\n    analyticsMessages ---e1u1--(e1u2 e2u2)---e2u3--\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a good example, and we fixed that problem with &#x27;errors.withLatestFrom(...&#x27;. But, since we are asynchronous don&#x27;t we also have to worry about this scenario.<p><pre><code>    errors            ---e1-------------------e2--\n    userActions       -u1--u2--u3-u4-u5-u6-u7-u8--\n    analyticsMessages ---e1u1---------------e2u8--\n</code></pre>\nNow, let me clarify what happened here. The error occurred after u2, but the errors thread got descheduled and the userActions thread kept on processing. I am not certain exactly what to expect from &#x27;errors.withLatestFrom(userActions,...&#x27; here but I suspect that &#x27;e2u8&#x27; may be the expected output.<p>So this error reporting system is fundamentally unreliable. If this is correct then I would say that combining Rx streams is not appropriate for this use case. This also suggests that although we managed to get rid of our glitches we still produced a terrible piece of software.<p>Do I have to wrong end of the stick?

The antique trade boomed in Paris and London. By 1890 Paris had 300 antique shops, up from 25 around 1850, says Manuel Charpy, a historian. But antiques, like clothes, go in and out of style. They boomed again in the 1950s and 1980s, when “period rooms” in a single nostalgic style were all the rage.</i><p>The upwardly mobile / striver class of middle class people with money to burn and a need to signal their social position is both smaller and made up differently than it was before. Instead of the traditional professional classes, we are in the age of the technician and skilled tradesman.<p>High-tech folk are dominated by engineers, a substantial portion of who hail from Asia. Their collecting tastes trend toward tech toys and away from European traditions. Skilled tradespeople are like a branch of applied engineers. Plumbers, electricians, gear heads and HVAC people tend to buy old cars, not 18th century furniture or silver service.<p>Also, people are less social than ever before, so status symbols shift. When you look at 3000 ft^2 homes, you see lots of fancy exterior stuff, and empty interiors. There&#x27;s no stigma to owning a million dollar home and sitting on beanbags today.",1450361540

We should strive for a system that does not require moral actors to function.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s desirable or even possible, and even if, it would be prohibitively expensive. Ultimately, the society itself is held together by trust and assumption that people generally behave morally. In every area where this assumption doesn&#x27;t hold we have to enact laws and systems that counter bad behaviour, and those are usually very costly and slow things down (just think about airport security). Trust is what allows us create efficient systems that save money by not having to strongarm people into particular patterns of behaviour, assuming instead they&#x27;ll follow those patterns of their own accord.<p>Moreover, systems disconnected from human morality seem to be an ultimate case of following the letter instead of spirit of the law. It risks turning a system into self-perpetuating one that doesn&#x27;t care about its intended purpose. If everything in healthcare would follow just the letter, how would we make sure it serves its actual function, i.e. keeping people healthy and happy?<p>Lastly, I believe that codifying things is a tradeoff with a serious cost - written laws have much smaller expressive power than intent-based rules. The world is complicated, people are complicated, but we all share the same brain architecture that does most of the work for us. To codify a simple &quot;be good to each other&quot; rule, you have to write <i>and maintain</i> thousands and thousands of pages of legalese, ridden with contradictions and corner cases. That&#x27;s a huge cost.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t write laws, or design systems to minimmize individual impact. But we need to remember that it&#x27;s a trade-off. It&#x27;s like the main problem of programming: computers are dumb, they don&#x27;t know what we <i>mean</i>. The laws don&#x27;t know it either (they&#x27;re basically code). But <i>we do</i>.

10751489,comment,10738548,10751210,0,0,acqq,,,"> I don&#x27;t see how &quot;a lot of money was invested&quot; proves how there is no alternate hardware that would make programming more productive.<p>Couldn&#x27;t maybe the reason for not understanding be not knowing enough about the theoretical and practical aspects of the hardware development? How about suggesting any reasonable direction for improvement? Practically everybody who&#x27;s involved with hardware and software constantly tries to make something better, somehow you posit that all of them are wrong for doing what they are doing?<p>It&#x27;s simple: people propose, sometimes also implement the &quot;alternate hardware.&quot; Hardware evolves to the demands, what we have is a result of the evolution. Unsuccessful fail, successful survive. Success is measured in people being ready to invest billions just to be able to produce a new generation of the CPUs, because that&#x27;s how much it costs. There&#x27;s no cheaper known way. If you invent something better than the existing state, and it&#x27;s provably and significantly better, it is going to be accepted. That&#x27;s how we have today ARM, that&#x27;s how we don&#x27;t use Itanium, that&#x27;s why Intel uses some technology developed by AMD. The leading position of Intel x32 and AMD x64 architectures on the desktops and servers was decided exactly because it was &quot;easier&quot; to program them compared to some other solutions (and the computations were also faster). ARM dominates for having some specific other advantages. All aspects, including these you recognized as important, are actually factored in the success of the current hardware.<p>>  the main point is that he was making tradeoffs for his math machine, not for modern software development<p>And this doesn&#x27;t mean that people just blindly reproduced what he did during the following 150-something years. Instead, just like he did, people constantly questioned what they did and decided based on the limitations they had, just like he. His design was more &quot;mentioned&quot; than actually used. It&#x27;s the opposite, once more or less independent development recognizes which ideas are the &quot;best&quot; in the given time and the given limitations, people who study the old research recognize that the same ideas were considered or even followed in some older designs. Now we have enough experience that we can study the failed and successful attempts that already answer some questions somebody new to the field can have.<p>> I have definitely a lot to learn about writing.<p>If you write about the possibility of a &quot;better hardware&quot; familiarizing more with the computer hardware and the theoretical and practical basis and limitations would help not sounding uneducated. Rules are to be broken, the &quot;well known truths&quot; are to be questioned to make a change, but the questioning has to be based on some knowledge, when it&#x27;s in the field where so much is dependent on the knowledge.",1450361317

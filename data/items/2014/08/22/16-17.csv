The post has since been removed, but a determined GitHub employee who could see that post could over time defeat the dummy detection with a method similar outlined in the post. Just continue to create new accounts on Secret and iterate on the friends in your contact list the way that git bisect works. Create an account with half your friends and see if the message pops up. If so, create a new account with half that list, and continue until you reach 7 and rotate in users you know aren&#x27;t responsible. In the end the person who made that horrible post will be revealed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/03/15/prominent-github-engineer-julie-ann-horvath-quits-claiming-gender-based-harassment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recode.net/2014/03/15/prominent-github-engineer-julie...</a>",1408726697

I was commenting on the mental health field&#x27;s having made the connection, on no serious evidence.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that mental health diagnoses follow popular taste, not scientific evidence. Homosexuality was a mental illness as long as the public held homosexuality to be unacceptable. In the pre-Civil War era, psychologists labeled a slave&#x27;s tendency to run away from his master as a mental illness, simply because that was a popularly accepted idea, with support among those who paid the psychologists:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania</a><p>In the same way, Asperger Syndrome seemed to be a way to attract paying clients -- but I don&#x27;t mean those who received the diagnosis, but the parents who paid the bills, who perhaps wanted Johnny to &quot;fit in&quot; better at school, be more &quot;normal&quot;.<p>In each of the quoted cases, public taste changed over time, and psychologists responded by abandoning a failed mental illness. It&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s a popularity contest.<p>If only real doctors could retire their diagnoses in the same way -- that would instantly solve the cancer and heart disease problems. But this is silly -- medicine isn&#x27;t psychology. Medicine is based on science.",1408726572

8212861,comment,8210957,8211644,1,0,moron4hire,,,"Assuming infinite bandwidth and rendering speed:<p>It sounds like, for a connection of latency L, at time T-2L, the server sends to the client multiple fully rendered frames, each representing the render state for time T for every possible user input that could occur between T-2L and T. The client receives these frames at time T-L, while sending a user input state at T-L which the server will use for a future packs of images. At time T, the client chooses the frame to display based on the actual input the user performed at time T, discarding the rest, and the server receives the user&#x27;s input from time T-L, using it to render and send the next pack of images for time T+2L.<p>So while it is strictly true that latency is impossible to avoid for the first two rendered frames, that&#x27;s only a small fraction of a second and only at the very beginning. After that it&#x27;s eliminated. Now obviously, rendering speed and bandwidth change the equation and is probably why there is a limit to the latency it can correct for. But this does appear to be a cure for <i>interframe</i> latency.<p>It&#x27;s lazy tree culling of every render state at every point in time for every conceivable user input state at that time. It&#x27;s certainly a big tree, but it seems they are making the statement that it&#x27;s small enough to fit in modern bandwidth capacities.<p>Of course, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this in your fighting game example to counteract the relative slow speed of the LCD, but that is because there would be no way to cull the set of images at the LCD itself.",1408726265

Unfortunately it&#x27;s something that is not easy to spot unless you are familiar with temperature anomaly graphs.<p>Roy picks a baseline of 1979-83, which is unusual (I&#x27;ve never seen any other anomaly graphs plotted using that baseline, and it&#x27;s especially strange since the graph only begins in 1983). The reason he does that is that during those years there is a brief but significant deviation between the model runs and the surface temperature data. By picking that baseline the effect is to shift the model results upwards. Hopefully these two images will make it clear what has been done:<p>This is the full data for GISTemp, UAH and a mean of the CMIP5 model runs (which I believe is the dotted black line on Roy&#x27;s graph) based on a longer 1981-2010 baseline. Also note the model runs actually started in 1979 not 1983:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/c2adVtw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/c2adVtw.jpg</a><p>As you can see, there is a brief but strong spike in the temperature data above the model mean (the model takes a dip as well increasing the effect). Using a narrow baseline of 79-83 gets you a graph that looks like this:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Ys1ZMZF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Ys1ZMZF.jpg</a><p>With the data starting at 1979 it&#x27;s a bit more obvious what has been done. Roy cropped his graph at 1983 so that it looks like the models start in 1983. Then used a baseline that shifted the model mean upwards to align with the 1983 temperature so that is looks like the model runs began with a starting point 1983 with the 1983 surface temperature and then immediately diverged. That is very misleading.<p>If you are wondering why some climate scientists don&#x27;t take the skeptics seriously, then this kind of manipulation is one of the reasons why. Roy is supposedly one of the reputable skeptics, being an actual scientist.<p>Graphs taken from: <a href=""http://blog.hotwhopper.com/2014/02/roy-spencers-latest-deceit-and-deception.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.hotwhopper.com/2014/02/roy-spencers-latest-decei...</a>",1408725399

Personally, I&#x27;m doing a PhD in computer science, and I find it incredibly frustrating. Publishing papers is all about minute incremental improvements, and you absolutely must have numerical results to prove that you beat the competition. You can&#x27;t publish negative results either, your work is considered worthless.<p>I&#x27;m in compilers and programming languages. I really wanted to create my own language as part of my PhD thesis, but I was basically told that this would be unpublishable. I mean, how can you hope to numerically show that your language is better than everything else around? Plus it&#x27;s all been done already, nothing else new can possibly be invented in that realm.<p>Things weren&#x27;t always like this. In the 1970s, we created things like Smalltalk, ML and LISP, which had a tremendous impact on the programming world. People also had bold ideas about artificial intelligence and nuclear-powered spaceships. In the 70s, people were allowed to just explore ideas, in the hopes that these ideas would lead to something good (and some did). Now, it&#x27;s much harder, you bring up an idea and people immediately try to shoot it down, ask you for proof that it definitely will work, and bring up the most asinine suggestions as to why your idea will definitely fail.<p>Today, the exploration has been scaled down. It&#x27;s not because the exploration failed, we invented many great things as a result of it, it&#x27;s largely IMO because we live in different economic times. The USA is no longer in an economic boom, things are no longer in expansion. There are cuts to scientific funding, cuts to education. People are being told not to be &quot;wasteful&quot;.

I&#x27;ve worked with PhoneGap, RubyMotion, and even a bit of Ruboto when it first came out.

You&#x27;ll have to learn Swift, or at least a little bit of it, eventually to stay up-to-date with the API docs. RubyMotion can certainly be an easier (and maybe more stable?) way to express what you&#x27;re doing, but you&#x27;re going to have to learn the mechanics of the base system in order to work with it, eventually.<p>So, as a Rubyist who love&#x27;s Laurent&#x27;s work even back to MacRuby, and mostly programs in Ruby these days, I say just learn Swift. From a pure language-appreciation perspective, as opposed to the practical perspective illustrated above, it&#x27;s in Apple&#x27;s best interest to make Swift easy to work with for app developers, because that&#x27;s Swift&#x27;s target market.

If ocean circulation is transporting more heat into the deep ocean than we thought, then that is something to change in the models.<p>If you are asking, why have they not thrown out our entire understanding of the climate system and started over, then I would argue that isn&#x27;t a way to actually improve our understanding of the climate. We would be starting over every day. Out understanding clearly isn&#x27;t all wrong. There are all sorts of other lines of evidence used to develop our understanding of the climate system. From things that are reproducible with simple experiments (or just application of basic physical laws), to things that have taken large investments and long term study to work out.<p>There can be all sorts of reasons that the model got it wrong (assuming it did, I don&#x27;t think we really have enough evidence one way or the other yet for the idea proposed in the OP - it seems like a bit of a curve fitting exercise at the moment). Not only is our understanding of the systems incomplete, our measurements are incomplete as well (and that gets much worse even just a few years ago - we&#x27;ve only had the Argo network of floats taking ocean temperature for a bit over a decade for example). Often there is just as much reason to suspect that it&#x27;s our measurements that are wrong than that it&#x27;s our understanding of the system. It&#x27;s just the nature of working on a system the size of the entire planet. It&#x27;s not easy to measure everything, and ever harder to measure what was happening in the past. There have been real issues where it was the data that was wrong and not the models.<p>See the UAH troposphere temperature record for example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset#Corrections_made"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_data...</a> It contradicted other data sets and the models, and it turns out there were errors in the way the temperatures were calculated.

Since the abandonment of the Asperger diagnosis, many have argued that it&#x27;s still with us, because it&#x27;s been folded into the Autism category. But this misses an important detail -- it wasn&#x27;t Asperger Syndrome itself that was folded into autism, but those who received the Asperger diagnosis -- which meant people were placed in the position of asking themselves whether they wanted to be thought of as autistic rather than an Aspie.<p>Among my many correspondents on this issue, being called an Aspie became desirable, fashionable. That was one reason the Asperger diagnosis was dropped -- it had become a popular, desirable mental illness. Psychologists had never before been in the position of having people ask for a particular diagnosis based on its popularity.<p>> (Let&#x27;s say we are talking about the words used by a careful clinician to communicate something, not what some rando on the internet said once about Bill Gates)<p>But in modern mental health practice, one cannot really ignore popular trends. It seems everyone knows what ADHD, PTSD and Asperger&#x27;s are, and how they rank in popularity. A psychologist would be at a severe disadvantage through not knowing that Asperger Syndrome had become a popular, desirable diagnosis, regardless of the social reasons.<p>Overhead conversation: &quot;So ... what&#x27;s your diagnosis?&quot; &quot;Well ...

Its rapid fire enough and randomized enough that you can fire off 5-10 small &#x27;exercises&#x27; without having to build elaborate (in the student&#x27;s mind) programs to practice the concept. The sequence of math to functions was great in my opinion. Hammer home the math, then repeat with a twist.<p>I will say arrays need makes a quick jump since the concept of starting counting at 0 is sometimes new to them.<p>If I were to use this, the features I&#x27;d love to see are the option to view it in different languages (I teach Python and Java). Also, someway of setting up practices and monitoring student activity would be nice; like, homework is 20 correct answers of math, variables, functions.<p>Very cool site!",1408723226

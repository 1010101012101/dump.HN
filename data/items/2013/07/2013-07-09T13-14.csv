It&#x27;s not like experienced programmers don&#x27;t make mistakes!

Surveillance of foreign agents does not require a warrant. Collection of meta-data does not require a warrant. Collection of records from third parties probably does not require a warrant, under existing precedent.<p>The Verizon call records example is a good one. See Smith v. Maryland: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland</a> (1979). That case decided that the government did not need a warrant to find what numbers were dialed by someone. &quot;In the Majority opinion, Justice Blackmun rejected the idea that the installation and use of a pen registry constitutes a violation of the &#x27;legitimate expectation of privacy&#x27; since the numbers would be available to and recorded by the phone company anyway.&quot;<p>Verizon&#x27;s call records are not only not private to you personally, since Verizon can see them, but not even your information to begin with, since they were generated by Verizon and not you. It&#x27;s a totally reasonable application of the existing precedent to say that the NSA can collect Verizon&#x27;s call records without a warrant.<p>For better or worse, we have a 4th amendment that:
1) does not apply to foreigners; and
2) does not apply to information you voluntarily expose to a third party (like bank records or phone records). This gives the government a wide latitude to collect information without running afoul of the 4th amendment. The purpose of FISA was to insert the FISC as a check on this discretion. The FISC does not seem to be a very effective check, but it&#x27;s not designed to let the executive do things that it could not otherwise do.",1373378042

But I&#x27;m not convinced about this part:<p>> Firefox OS offers the best cost-benefit ratio once you think about how much performance you have against your hardware specs. If you pick the same low-end hardware with Android or Firefox OS, Android will have a worse experience, not because Android is broken in any way, Android is great but because there are more things going on on Android than on Firefox OS. Firefox OS is just a tiny hal, gecko and gaia, while Android has a VM and lots of other things going on.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some of the components that a modern mobile OS needs:<p>* Kernel<p>* Hardware abstraction layer<p>* OpenGL ES implementation and compositor<p>* 2D vector graphics API<p>* UI toolkit<p>Android and Firefox OS both also have a VM to run managed code, along with a JIT compiler. Android&#x27;s VM, Dalvik, was specifically designed to be memory efficient in the case where several apps are running as separate Unix processes. Is the same true of SpiderMonkey?<p>So Android and Firefox OS share many of the same types of fundamental components, and in some cases, the same components (the kernel, some aspects of the HAL). But on top of this, Firefox OS and its apps add:<p>* Markup language processor and layout engine designed for hypertext documents, not UIs<p>* Parser for a poorly designed programming language (JS), and advanced JIT optimizations that in effect extract the latent static types from a dynamically typed language. By contrast, Dalvik accepts bytecode as input, and the program is already statically typed, so the JIT compiler can be much simpler<p>* Hacks on top to turn this combination of hypertext markup language and poorly designed programming language into a tolerable UI toolkit and application platform<p>So how can you say that Firefox OS is more resource-efficient than Android? Perhaps the Android platform developers have gotten sloppy lately, since they&#x27;re primarily concerned about high-end phones. But that can be remedied. What matters is that, as far as I can tell, the Android platform was designed for efficiency, while the Web platform was not.<p>I hesitate to bash the Web platform, because for better or worse, it seems to be the best way of achieving Mozilla&#x27;s mission, and I believe social ends outweigh technical means. But I believe I have accurately described the current reality.",1373376444
6012521,comment,6012009,6012403,3,0,VLM,,,"&quot;Unicode assigns the same number to the character.&quot;<p>Extremely close but not quite right for some weird corner cases.  There&#x27;s either a cool feature or hideous bug in the unicode design, depends how you look at it, that lets you compose multiple unicode codes together into one glyph.  So you can say, &quot;Gimme the code for A with a bar over it&quot; or &quot;Gimme the code for A, now gimme the code for put a bar over the last glyph&quot;.  Even worse you can stack compose characters, so you can write &quot;A with circle on top and squiggly underneath&quot; at least five different ways in binary that should be rendered visually identical.<p>There is the one true normalization technique that most people use to convert what they consider poor unicode grammar into a standard form.  Some people don&#x27;t use it of course.  And anytime you give users freeform input who knows what kind of crud they&#x27;ll feed you.  So you can never really assume any unicode string is normalized unless you personally normalized it yourself.  Even then theoretically two normalized strings, concatenated, might or might not be normalized anymore (although this is often not much of a problem).  And this strikes substring manipulation too.<p>A fun source of buffer overflows is normalization can shrink OR EXPAND a unicode string, in theory.  So if you use one of those languages without variable length strings, look out.  Or if the language tries to take care of it for you, this leads to weird memory fragmentation.  Maybe a DOS/DDOS opportunity?<p>Which leads to philosophical argument you must decide in your code, if two bitstreams don&#x27;t match, but you get matching glyph renderings, from the program&#x27;s point of view are they a match or not?  Depends if what your program is trying to do I guess.  Most languages have a library to handle this.  Writing your own unicode handler functions is a &quot;here be dragons&quot; moment.<p>Composing characters are also a fun source of swear words if you&#x27;re trying to count the number of characters in a file.  Something that renders literally identically will have an identical number of characters but somewhat varying number of bytes.<p>Other fun philosophical arguments are if you read in a un-normalized string and output a normalized string have you changed the string?  Well, both no, and yes.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s crypto steagongraphy implications.<p>Google for &quot;unicode normalization form nfc&quot; and stuff like that.<p>The first page I found with a good faq was:<p><a href=""http://www.macchiato.com/unicode/nfc-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macchiato.com/unicode/nfc-faq</a>",1373376443

Even though talent is still hard to find and rare in the Bay Area (because it&#x27;s rare everywhere, just less rare there) those companies <i>think</i> they have a lot of talent, because software managers are too unskilled to detect high talent. So that holds the high end back.<p>If VC weren&#x27;t propping up the Bay Area and the job market weren&#x27;t so flaccid outside of the VC-funded ecosystem and finance, we&#x27;d see a lot of the best programmers leaving for the #3-6 tech hubs and the excellence premium would be more ($60k by the number above, but in a low-COL area and with high autonomy).",1373375682

6012425,comment,6011659,6012139,31,0,soapdog,,,"Hey PommeDeTerre,<p>Allow me to give a different perspective here. While in many other mobile operating systems you can build apps with HTML (saying HTML from now on but meaning HTML/CSS/JS, ok?), the API the vendors make available don&#x27;t cover the same features as what is native on that platform. We can say that Firefox OS is important because of the following things:<p>MAKING THE WEB A FIRST CLASS CITIZEN<p>Makes the web a first class citizen. Its not like &quot;you can build apps with web technology&quot;, its more like you don&#x27;t need native because all you need is available thru the web apis. While in other platforms, there is a barrier on what can be accomplished with HTML alone, on Firefox OS HTML is the way. Let me give you a silly but practical example:<p>Suppose you have an intranet on your small company built by IT in PHP or something. This intranet has an address book for everyone in the company. Using the Web API, you can detect the contacts API and offer the user the ability to import contacts from the web directly to the phones contact book. This is done in a secure way, with permissions granted by the user, its not like &quot;hey, open this page and flood the contact database&quot;. The security model is good. This is a silly example but it is useful for many people. Its the tiny APIs that make your life easier and your experience better.<p>GIVING YOU THE FREEDOM OF THE WEB<p>In platforms such as iOS, your only venue to distribute your apps is the iTunes App Store. All money passes thru Apple. On Android, you can have third party stores but the default setting is to allow  apps from Google Play only (unless you&#x27;re a kindle or nook). Most of the other platforms are about controlling the ecosystem to make money for the vendor.<p>On Firefox OS you have the Firefox Marketplace that is a mixture of Chrome Webstore and Google Play. It allows distribution of apps for desktop, android and firefox os (all using gecko runtime). You are not tied to Firefox Marketplace though. You have an install API that you can use on your app or your site to install apps on the users phone (Again, it asks permissions, security is good). You can even fork the Firefox Marketplace code and build your own.<p>Talking about payment, you have the usual credit card charging on the marketplace but you also have carrier billing (if the carrier implement it) allowing users to buy apps and have it charged to their prepaid cards or monthly bill. Remember that in many markets, people don&#x27;t have credit cards. If you&#x27;re not happy with both solutions you can roll your own payment solution using the payments API and receipt protocol. You are free to distribute and monetize your app as you see fit, just like on the web.<p>ITS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR YOUR IPHONE OR GALAXY S3<p>If you have an Android device, you can just install Firefox Mobile and be happy since we&#x27;ll eventually have feature parity between Firefox Mobile and Firefox OS. These Firefox OS phones are being created for emergent markets. People from U.S. and richer parts of Europe don&#x27;t really realize how things are in south america and asia. An Samsung Galaxy S3 will cost USD 1000 in Rio right now while the minimum wage is about USD 350. Buying such expensive phones require a plan and saving for a long time. 78% of the Brazilian market is on feature phones.<p>By offering an inexpensive handset that has a full smartphone experience with a price that is affordable is key in these markets. It is about bringing the next million people online on the mobile web for the first time. Firefox OS is here to be the first smartphone for people that are still on Symbian or S40. In some markets you can buy a cheap android with decent performance, in others you can&#x27;t.<p>Firefox OS offers the best cost-benefit ratio once you think about how much performance you have against your hardware specs. If you pick the same low-end hardware with Android or Firefox OS, Android will have a worse experience, not because Android is broken in any way, Android is great but because there are more things going on on Android than on Firefox OS. Firefox OS is just a tiny hal, gecko and gaia, while Android has a VM and lots of other things going on.<p>As I said before, this is not about fighting Android, its about offering a new choice for those that can&#x27;t afford a good Android or iPhone. Here in Brazil, we have some very cheap Android devices since we have Samsung, LG and others building them locally. Most of these devices are pretty crap to use. The same hardware with Firefox OS would be a much better experience.<p>ITS ABOUT THE WEB API<p>The objective here is not to sell phones or be dominant. Firefox OS is about preventing vendor lock-in. Right now, each platform is an island. iOS has Objective-C/Cocoa Touch, Android has Java, Windows Phone has something that I can&#x27;t recall. If you want to build cross platform apps, you&#x27;re in for a world of hurt. You can use phonegap but this is not something offered by the platform vendor, this something that was built to bridge the web and native.<p>The Web API is the next step in this direction. Each of the APIs in the collection known as Web API is being standardized with the W3C and other interested parties. The idea is that other vendors adopt these APIs and that open web apps work anywhere equally. Firefox OS is not about an exclusive experience, it is about openness and freedom. Even if Firefox OS fail but the Web API succeeds, it will be a huge victory for the open web.<p>ITS ALSO ABOUT BEING CREATIVE<p>Right now there is a steep learning curve regarding developing native apps for most platforms. Objective-C and Java are easy languages for CS people but for the layman they are pretty hard. It requires a lot of effort to be good with them.<p>Why is the web a success? If the web required such effort, we&#x27;d still be using gopher and news. One of the reasons the web was a success was that it required less effort to produce something useful. I am not saying good, I am saying useful. Anyone could host a server, anyone with a text editor could build pages. Firefox OS is about bringing this to mobile. It requires less effort and your open web apps can be deployed on other platforms such as iOS and Android (with phonegap or other runtimes). Yes, these days it requires a lot of effort to build good web apps but not much to build useful ones. Firefox OS has the potential and openness to bring all web developers to mobile with ease. Open Web Apps are king of local content. Niche apps that are only useful for those in a neighborhood or profession are a web editor away from being born and available. The web is king for local content and Firefox OS is nothing but an mobile extension of the web.<p>WHY I THINK FIREFOX OS WILL SUCCEED?<p>As I said above, Firefox OS is nothing but the web and the web can&#x27;t fail because it already succeeded. Right now the only technology that bridges smart tvs, video games, smartphones, desktop and laptop computers together is HTML/CSS/JS.<p>Remember how much progress we had in JS runtimes the last year, try to imagine where we&#x27;re going to be next year. Javascript is already reaching 1.5x native speed in some cases, two years from now, this won&#x27;t matter because it will as fast as it needs to be. One could argue that for most mobile app needs, it is already fast enough.<p>Apps built for Firefox OS can be deployed as web pages and made available on a server. They can be sold on Chrome webstore and Firefox Marketplace. They can be wrapped with phonegap and deployed to iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BB10, Bada, Tizen and webOS. They can be wrapped in other runtimes and be used on Smart TVs and video games. The web is the king of cross platform, of vendor neutrality and without lock-ins.<p>I think that the future belong to HTML based solutions and all platforms that embrace it.<p>PS: I am a Mozilla Rep and a Firefox OS Launch Team member in Brazil.",1373375099

It doesn&#x27;t go as far as the JVM, but &quot;minuscule&quot; is definitely wrong.<p>> I was talking practice: I&#x27;ve worked on porting two multi-million LOC soft real-time applications from C++ to Java, and a few smaller programs; big performance improvements in all cases.<p>My experience is the opposite. Not two million lines - just a few tens of thousands, but still.<p>> This has no relevance to the discussion, though there&#x27;s plenty of nice, readable Java code. Anyway, I was talking about the JVM, not specifically Java the language.<p>One of the previous posts (to which I was replying) claimed that Java is faster in practice because (paraphrasing) it is nicer to read and write, and that was a response to that.<p>> Right... and as far as I can tell, you&#x27;re not really into Java :) That&#x27;s okay.

6012418,comment,6012214,6012214,9,0,danso,,,"> <i>But consider for a moment the year 1985, one of the darkest ever for commercial air travel. By the end of that year, 27 crashes had resulted in the deaths of almost 2,400 people. These included the Air India bombing over the North Atlantic, with 329 casualties, and, two months later, the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 outside Tokyo, with 520 dead. (These, the second- and fifth-deadliest incidents in aviation history, happened 49 days apart.) Also in 1985 were the Arrow Air disaster in Newfoundland that killed more than 240 U.S. servicemen, the infamous British Airtours 737 fire, and the crash of a Delta Air Lines L-1011 in Dallas that killed 137.</i><p>Wow, the number of fatalities that year is incomprehensible by today&#x27;s standards. Yes, this accident has made big news because so few accidents have happened in this decade...but I&#x27;d say that today&#x27;s news cycle has served to amplify just about everything, no matter what their statistical, relative, or absolute significance.",1373375030

6012410,comment,6012009,6012320,7,0,VLM,,,"I think its confusing the definition of &quot;talk&quot;.  Software written to handle UTF-8 can literally simply have 7bit ASCII shoved thru them.  No translation necessary, no software modification necessary or anything.<p>On the other hand software speaking UTF-32 isn&#x27;t going to tolerate ASCII being shoved thru them.  The output is going to be 1/4 the length you expected and probably a mass of random asian glyphs.  You CAN write a shim that turns each 7 bit ascii char into a 32 bit UTF-32 char and it&#x27;ll work 1:1 perfectly for all 128 characters in ASCII.  But outta the box, no you have to write a shim.<p>Now if you REALLY want to confuse people, after they 100% understand ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-32, then feed some UTF-16 into something designed to eat either UTF-32 or ASCII or UTF-8.  If you understand what a byte order mark is, and why its important, and how to use it, then you&#x27;re along the way to understanding UTF-16.<p>This was a common whine about unicode in the early days that all you&#x27;ve done is trade the agony of multiple extended ascii code pages for the agony of multiple formats to represent unicode... Should have just spec&#x27;d UTF-8 and no other encoding and been done with it... or maybe UTF-32.<p>I will say that a world where only UTF-32 exists would be a world with a lot more text compression of webserver responses and stuff like that.

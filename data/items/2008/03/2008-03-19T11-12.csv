140740,comment,138229,138380,0,0,delackner,,,"I think a lot of us end up hesitating to bother opening an article because so often the submitted-title is a bad attempt at humor that instead completely masks the true topic of the article.  Titles like ""you really want to know..."" are a total waste of my time.  KNOW WHAT?  If the topic is interesting, I will click.  If it is about something of interest only to you, don't post it with a title that forces everyone to click just to know what the subject matter even is.<p>That said, I always read via google reader, since the actual interface makes it impossible to say ""I have seen all these, don't show me them again!"".",1205926703

Should I spend my summer at a small (30 people) startup or at a reasonably big (1000 people) CS/Art company? ...""</i><p>Internship hey.<p>It's not real work. If you go to SoftCo it might be a chance to improve an existing product niche like Flemlord suggests. But if you try a startup (30's a lot & I'd call this big) you might just see how hard you really have to work and learn something new as well.<p>If it was me I'd pick the one that gives you the <i>""best payoff""</i> for working up-wind in the future.",1205926259

140732,comment,140602,140602,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Good article, Matt.  Thanks.  I like the way you think.<p>I think that part of the confusion of people when they get into the startup scene, is that they loose sight of what a successful exit does for you: solves the money problem.  That's it. Nothing else. Nada.<p>A successful exit will not buy you love. It will not make you instantly happy.  An exit will not provide you with meaning and purpose in life.  It will not make you immortal.  It will not fix all the other problems in your life.  It solves one and only one problem:  the money problem.<p>If you talk to people in the valley who were sudden millionaires in the first dot.com gold rush, I think that you'll find that sudden wealth brings its own set of problems which you touched on in your article.  I actually remember reading a number of articles about the struggles of the nouveau-rich after their dot com went public.<p>These things are worth keeping in mind when you're thinking about that startup, or in dealing with relationships while you're in a startup.  Be careful burning bridges with family and friends when you're working 100 hours a week with your startup.  They might not be there when you find your exit.",1205925489

My girlfriend and I got jobs straight out of university, and we could forget buying a place, and even renting was using up so much of our income that it was just a treadmill.<p>We left, basically. We've moved to Vienna (Austria) and living relatively cheaply in my late grandmother's place. I'm trying to get a startup off the ground, she's slowly figuring out what she wants to do.<p>And yeah, we're super-lucky to even have that opportunity.<p>I honestly don't know how London is staying as populous as it is.

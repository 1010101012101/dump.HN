If I'm working with crappy programmers I don't want the system to keep going and corrupting data -- in the vast majority of cases, that's the worst possible result.  Taking down the system with an nice error message and stack trace is a much much better.  Crappy programmers, in the presence of checked exceptions, will handle exceptions with empty catch clauses (to prevent breaking anything) and there will be no way to find that error when it happens.",1235761179

Even the application form for startup school asks you about what systems you've hacked in the past.<p>I am a fairly intelligent guy, if I can say so myself, who somehow ended up in computer science, ended up going to grad school but realized later on that my true interests and calling really lie somewhere else. I'm not a hacker so to say and I don't particularly enjoy programming - certainly not to the extent that I could have orgasms doing it and spend countless hours just doing it for fun. I look at it as a means to an end, do it to get my job done and happen to be decently good at it. I'm in the process of launching a site here and have already launched a beta version of it in India (our initial target audience). I learned RoR/AJAX/CSS and all else associated with deploying it in my spare time (my day job is a systems one with C coding). I truly enjoy the process of taking an idea from concept to launch and building a successful business around it. I spend much time thinking and working on it, learning about all aspects from the engineering to the business side. I've been working on my idea for over an year and half now, all in my spare time, riding many ups and downs and persevering through.<p>But please explain, why this ridiculous idea that to be an Internet entrepreneur, you should just absolutely be in love with programming & hacking anything and everything to death!",1235760060

But I've seen architects at work, and the majority of their work is collaborative, discussing ideas, coming up with new ideas, etc.<p>Designing a building draws together a lot of creativity applied at all levels, from the door handles to the shape of the building, and a major difficulty is to coordinate all this to keep the building looking like it was designed as a whole, rather than have all sorts of different styles mixing with each other.<p>Until architecture becomes a solitary activity (unlikely for all but the smallest buildings, for quite some time), central office spaces will remain a necessity there.

Without a product people actually get value from (ie: what enables organic growth), the spike just drops off to where it was before the spike (cuil anybody?). I don't think the author thinks that you just need PR driven spikes, but what he's discussing isn't anywhere near as nice as viral growth.<p>When we launch new versions of Miro, we tend to get covered on all the big sites and see really big traffic spikes. Our user base typically doubles after one of these spikes and then stays relatively flat. This means that people like using our product, but don't help spread it. Next month we'll have over a million users, so I'm not complaining. Nonetheless, if these users spread our product to friends in addition to just using it, we'd be a LOT better off.

The trouble is that every time you call a method that throws an exception, you create an immediate crisis: you break the build. Rather than conciously planning an error handling strategy, programmers do something, anything, to make the compiler shut up.""<p>Frankly, this is the weirdest complaint I've ever seen about checked exceptions.  If you're trying to build a system with crappy programmers, you're kind of screwed anyway, but checked exceptions actually help you out quite a bit, because you don't have a problem with stray exceptions taking down entire subsystems.  You might miss a lot of meaningful errors and get corrupted data, but at least the system keeps running, and that's the most you can hope for if your programmers are as crappy and lazy as the article describes.<p>And contrary to the article, few programmers are really that lazy and irresponsible.  In my experience, far more code is written by responsible programmers who are inexperienced, rushed, or lacking a complete understanding of the system.  Checked exceptions catch a lot of normal programming errors and result in more error cases being handled correctly.  Like any other restriction imposed by a programming language, they don't ensure perfect code, sometimes they result in busy work, and crappy programmers will find crappy ways to work around them, but IMHO they are helpful for most programmers.",1235758521

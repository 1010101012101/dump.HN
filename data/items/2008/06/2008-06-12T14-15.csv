My grandfather invested some money on my behalf when I was born, so when I graduated from college, I burned through $10K of it without a second thought. Then I finally swallowed my pride, got a job working minimum wage, and suddenly gained new appreciation for the value of money. Discovering that buying lunch is essentially equivalent to eating an hour's worth of work will do that.<p>It's also easy to post on Slashdot ""what a whiner!"" whenever a story comes up about $OSS_SOFTWARE not fulfilling $BUSINESS_NEED. That's another perspective that disappears quickly when working for a real business.

Yes, AT&T has ""raised"" the price of their wireless plan... but it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, since the new plan is 3G and the old one is not.<p>Now, if you want to argue that 3G isn't enough of an improvement to be worth the premium price, I'll hear you. I have no experience, myself, so I have no idea. I will note, though, that Apple has thoughtfully discounted the iPhone 3G to the point where the TCO over two years is within $30-$50 of what it has been. So even if 3G turns out to be nearly worthless, I'll only be paying about $3 extra per month over two years.<p>As for AT&T putting me over a barrel and raising their rates... I wouldn't put it past them, but it would surely be a very stupid move, calculated to ensure the loss of a double-digit percentage of their customers. And can they do that during my contract? Cell phone contracts may be drawn up by Mephistopheles and signed in blood, but they are <i>contracts</i>, and I'm pretty sure that threatening to unilaterally raise prices will invalidate them.",1213279993

215936,comment,215664,215695,0,0,bhb,,,"I actually enjoy writing unit tests _because_ I'm lazy :).<p>When I write a piece of Ruby code, I have a choice: I could either write a unit test or load the code into IRB and manually test it (or even load the real app and test the code in there).<p>For me, doing it manually is often more work. Let's say I have five tests in my head. My code passes the first four, but fails the fifth. After I fix the bug I found, I have to manually go back and test all five behaviors again. Unfortunately, my code often has more than one bug, so this process can take awhile. Once my code passes the tests, I always run the real app to make sure there are no bugs in my tests.<p>Plus, for me, writing code is just more fun than doing tedious manual testing, even if it takes a little longer initially.<p>As with everything, there are exceptions. If I'm fixing bugs, I tend to have a TDD approach, but if I'm doing exploratory programming, I tend to not write tests until the code is pretty stable. It's also hard to unit test GUI code, so think about the expected return on your time investment.<p>One thing to keep in mind: tests are more fun to write (and more importantly, more effective) as you get better at them. Writing tests is an art unto itself - just because you write good production code doesn't mean you'll instantly write great test code. It takes practice.<p>I sometimes hear people say, ""Unit testing takes too time to write and maintain!"" While there will always be some costs, I've found that as I've gotten better at writing tests, those costs have gone way down, while the benefit has gone up.",1213279720

Some PEOPLE are not. Maybe it's just because I happen to attend a top university that is highly competitive, but I don't commonly see this lack of confidence.

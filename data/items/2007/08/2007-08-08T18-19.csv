40599,comment,40524,40593,0,0,motivi,,,"What is that difference? In IT, I'd imagine that no person in his right mind would choose to implement s/w dev in the method defined in the PMP. There is scrum, agile, rup and dozens more processes. <p>I guess, does a PMP say that you have managed s/w projects and you know the process. In the same way that a graduate in IT can prove that he has studied the field.",1186599063

Those startups that didn't make it obviously needed help with running their startups, and here he is - helping them by giving them the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson on how people will take their money if they aren't careful.  This way, those startups that didn't make the top 20 will be better prepared for the future!<p>/sarcasm<p>This man has little in the way of ethical practices.  Even if I were in the top 20 and didn't have to pay, I would be hesitant to work with this man in any type of situation.<p>If this is the way he treats the groups that tried to get into the top 20, how does he treat those actual top 20?
Is he presenting only his privileged investors to the startups who present, reducing real funding competition?
What about any agreements that the startups have signed in the program?  Have they fully checked those out?<p>When an organizer of an event practices little ethical credibility, the entire event must come into question.",1186597230

5998145,comment,5994546,5995467,1,0,saraid216,,,"Okay, let&#x27;s do this.<p>Democracy isn&#x27;t about accountability or critical publics, though I&#x27;ll concede the third point about tools for discussion, which we don&#x27;t have enough of, and which are of fairly pitiful quality in this day and age. (That&#x27;s going to be a contentious claim, isn&#x27;t it? Damn. I&#x27;ll footnote my complaint as [1] then.) Accountability and critical publics are, I agree, necessary but they&#x27;re nowhere near sufficient.<p>I do not think that it is working particularly well in any country. No country I know of has a population dedicated towards an increased participation in their own governance. At best, they ask a class of well-to-do persons to handle their governance on their behalf.<p>But I also think a well-done democracy is actually an ideal worth pursuing. It is not enough to imagine democracy as the least tyrannical, most tolerant state of government: it must be something positively defined to be recognized as an ambition. For that, I turn to a book published in 1916, John Dewey&#x27;s <i>Democracy and Education</i>.<p>&quot;A democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience. The extension in space of the number of individuals who participate in an interest so that each has to refer his own action to that of others, and to consider the action of others to give point and direction to his own, is equivalent to the breaking down of those barriers of class, race, and national territory which kept men from perceiving the full import of their activity.&quot; [2]<p>To me, a well-done democracy is one in which the overwhelming majority of the population (for those who want a number, let&#x27;s call it 70 to 80 percent) are actively participant in their governance. One possible way to measure active participation is the drafting of legislation. (Voting is passive participation; a head count, to paraphrase Einstein [3], requires only a spine. It does not require a large brain.) Sure, this requires free flow of information, critical thinking, and tools for discussion, but you begin to recognize that having gcc, gdb, and a decent CS education is not sufficient to write an operating system from scratch: you have to actually put code to computer. For me, such a goal necessitates a reconstructed educational system. Perhaps I am wrong about that, but if I thought that, I wouldn&#x27;t be trying to come up with one. :)<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more. It isn&#x27;t sufficient to have heavy participation. It has to be maintained. Such sustained participation isn&#x27;t possible if some particular subset or coalition gains an upper hand: and yet that is <i>exactly</i> how any kind of legislation can ever be passed. What&#x27;s needed here is ways to guarantee that underdog groups always have their voices acknowledged, heard, engaged with, and accounted for. An effort should be made to keep them from losing every vote; such an effort, I expect, will inevitably lead to a fracturing of any underdog group whose interests actually non-beneficial. That&#x27;s an unproven guess, but it is my expectation. You can read more about this particular issue in the place my thinking on it was inspired from, Danielle Allen&#x27;s <i>Talking to Strangers</i> [4].<p>And lastly, there needs to be a kind of standard, a set of shared values that can undergird the very notion of a democracy. Why is it ideal that everyone has a voice? The core behind it is an egalitarianism: the bedrock belief that no one is intrinsically worth more than another. This egalitarianism has often been expressed as an equality of outcome (proportionate representation), or an equality of opportunity (non-discrimination), or an equality of process (everyone jumps through the same hoops). I favor Amartya Sen&#x27;s equality of autonomy [5] which leads into the capabilities approach that he developed alongside Martha Nussbaum [6]. I like the capabilities approach because it avoids many of the pitfalls that previous arguments have run into: you can&#x27;t stymie its analysis by moving macroscopically to statistical claims or microscopically to anecdote: its equally applicable to both cases. It&#x27;s on bases like this that rule of law can be built.<p>It&#x27;s important, I feel, to aspire towards democracy rather than resign ourselves to it. Such resignation makes room for a willingness to trade in democratic powers for short-term gratuity, such as the ever popular &quot;liberty for security&quot; but also things like &quot;education for solvency&quot; or &quot;inclusiveness for comfort&quot;. Even if we misstep or are embattled, we do need to believe that there&#x27;s a worthwhile goal to shoot for. Otherwise it&#x27;s a constant battle of attrition for rights until there are none left, because we can&#x27;t positively assert them on their own merits.<p>[1] Our communication tools have not been developed with community or collaboration in mind. This is particularly notable with Engelbart&#x27;s passing, but it&#x27;s always worth noting how very exceptional it is every time a decent &quot;social&quot; space like Github or Discourse comes out. Our tooling has focused almost exclusively on one-to-one communication, rarely even bothering to consider how three or more people could interact. This might be simple laziness, but what it really says to me is how <i>inconsequential</i> the notion of existing in a community is for us as a society: there&#x27;s no itch to be scratched by good tools for discussion. The itch isn&#x27;t there.

In some cases, perhaps the C++ code would have taken 0.1s, where the ruby code takes 5s.

The opposite is true, when the tide is high you cannot see who is swimming naked, so one should not make too much assumptions about their clothes.<p>In the late 90&#x27;s everyone thought that microsoft had found the perfect way to manage programmers and run a software company. All kinds of companies would try to emulate microsoft methods. But in reality, that clever fox Gates guided Microsoft into the perfect strategic position. Once microsoft had to compete in fields that were outside their monopoly the results were not as dominating.<p>Similarly Amazon is in a great strategic position nowadays, because they have built out the infrastructure that the US uses to shop online. Their stock is flying high, so everyone assumes they must be doing something right. And they undoubtedly are.<p>But that does not necessarily mean that their practices of managing programmers are optimal or even good. In fact if you look at Amazon&#x27;s finances you are stricken at how little profit they make. It is unclear why, because their financial statements are very opaque.<p>But it is entirely possible that they are hemorrhaging money because of the way the hire and fire programmers but the whole thing is hidden by their strategic position.

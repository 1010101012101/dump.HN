And just to answer some obvious things, yeah, if they have a specific criminal investigation, they dont have to tell the people in advance that theyre getting paid, because that would reveal it. Yeah, that would be under court order; that should be an exception, as it always has to be in a democracy. They will not be able to do omni spying anymore. They wont be able to spy in advance without people knowing theyre being spied on, because the people will get money, and thats proper. It is actually a totally reasonable solution.</i>&quot;<p>So government will <i>have</i> to pay us for the data that they are getting for free from companies that are getting it for free? What would that even look like and how would we get there from where we are now (Gov threatens companies to fork over information they get for free from users)?

Because just &quot;being a country&quot; and &quot;agrarian&quot; is not enough classify a country in the same boat as those.<p>Russia has a long history of serfdom, an authoritarian regime, young people passionate about change, a huge territory and large population etc. China, about the same, only much larger.<p>In fact, if anything it&#x27;s the opposite: most countries failed to ever make the transition (most of the third world for example, Africa, Asia, Latin America).<p>As for the Western countries that made the same transition:<p>a) some made it peacefully (those that were in better position to do so, namely: small and manageable, with an established social order from before, no dangerous neighbours and plenty of money rolling in).<p>b) others had no &quot;starving of millions of people to death&quot; mainly because they got a good deal out of starving millions of OTHER people to death. E.g France, Netherlands, Belgium, UK, financing their industrial age with looting and enslaving their colonies in Africa, Asia, etc.<p>(And we should not forget the bloody continental European wars and revolutions that got a lot of countries out of agrarian feudalism and aristocracy and into the modern type industrial republic. Millions died in the French Revolution, the Napoleonian wars and the subsequent turmoil than made France into a modern republic, and then there was WWI.

I agree with the author -- small but not simple.<p>Platforms differ and it leaks into the language precisely because it is such a simple language.  It is simple like HTML 1.0 is simple.

They have to do with memory management (null pointers, buffer overruns, etc) and poorly written macros.<p>3. I agree with you that adding optimizers introduce a whole set of things you have to hold in your head that push you into &#x27;large&#x27; territory.  Just like programming on a GPU makes you rethink everything about how you organize code and writing for embedded code has its own set of rules.<p>But how does that make the language large?<p>My point is that a language that says &quot;we manage memory on your behalf inside of a VM&quot; is doing a lot more for you.<p>Boy, are we beating this thing to death or what...<p>...<p>I like C quite a bit but I wouldn&#x27;t want to make a living programming in it today. I drop back into C when I have a compute kernel that needs it but 99% of the code remains in C#.  C is small but too simple for the problems that I&#x27;m solving today.",1374210588

The technique by itself will not produce a very valuable publication, but the results it can reveal could be ground breaking.<p>In the grant proposal, in order to convince those who are judging of the value of the technique, you detail some of the hard won technique.  A competitor issues a FOIA learns the technique and may very well be able to publish the ground breaking results first.<p>This means years of work and funding have had considerably less benefit then anticipate. It is likely it will be a little harder to win additional grant/funding due to several apparently unproductive years on the researches part.",1374210419

I&#x27;ll try to say a little something.<p>Colleges certainly aren&#x27;t altruistic.<p>For the most part colleges, and even more so, research universities, want to be &quot;better than each other&quot;. The competition isn&#x27;t for money so much as for its own sake.<p>It is easy to find out what colleges think is worth bragging about: visit any of their homepages.<p>It is important, as patio11&#x27;s quote suggests, to remember that the interests of different groups -- undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, administration, alumni -- are not necessarily aligned. When I was an undergrad at Rice, in addition to the student newspaper we had &quot;Rice News&quot;, rather similar in content to the &quot;news&quot; on university homepages. I regarded this as propaganda and sneered at the &quot;faculty newspaper&quot;; now that I am on a university faculty, I realize that the faculty don&#x27;t read these newspapers either.<p>From an administrative level, most everything costs money. You can build new buildings, fancy new dorms, start new programs, poach famous faculty, etc. And so they think about money a lot. Departments don&#x27;t have to think about where the money comes from, but they are always fighting to get a piece of it.<p>Professors want good students to teach, time to do research, and to be left alone by the administration. University administrators always have pet projects (at South Carolina it&#x27;s the &quot;Carolina Core&quot;) and it&#x27;s rare to find a professor who gives a damn about any of them.<p>You mention &quot;a compassionate job of preparing eighteen year olds for adult life&quot;. But &quot;adult life&quot; means very different things to different people, and many professors, certainly including myself, are extreme outliers. So I personally stick to teaching my students math, and trying to get them excited about it -- that is what I am good at.",1374210354

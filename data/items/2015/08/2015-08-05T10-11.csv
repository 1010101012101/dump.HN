Then it is approved, or not, by the parliament.

It doesn&#x27;t even mention Tito and Stalin, the people who were directly controlling the Greek communists. This wasn&#x27;t about the British vs a genuine Greek uprising, it was simply one of the early proxy battles in the cold war. And the Greeks were extremely lucky that the communists did not win.<p>>But what the freedom fighters wanted, insists Glezos “was what we had achieved during the war: a state ruled by the people for the people. There was no plot to take over Athens as Churchill always maintained. If we had wanted to do that, we could have done so before the British arrived.”<p>What did you need all those weapons for, then? The truth is that ELAS had already taken over of most of the country, and only stopped because Stalin directed them to. Unlike Tito, he wanted to avoid confrontation with the Allies at that point.<p>Ultimately one of the most important events that led to the end of the civil war was the split between Tito and Stalin (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split);"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split);</a> Tito had been providing support for DSE (the military wing of the communist party), allowing them free movement in Yugoslavia and setting up training camps, re-supply stations, hospitals, etc. After the split, the Greek communist party sided with Stalin (they didn&#x27;t even pick the &quot;benevolent&quot; dictator!) and Tito closed the border with Greece.<p>The idea that this military organization, allied with and directed by two communist dictators, had any interest in a democratic state is insane.",1438770497

At least Romania was. This makes your comparison flawed, because when a country is somewhat rich, with a working middle class, with somewhat working institutions, it does have the resources to spare and it will still be doing OK.<p>Because of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact between Hitler and Stalin, we&#x27;ve lost territories like Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, by force of course. And I must say that this was happening in 1940, with a Romania that hadn&#x27;t entered the war yet. Russians later blamed us for giving support to the Germans on their invasion, but that&#x27;s why they say you reap what you sow. Bessarabia is now the republic of Moldova. We still think of them as being Bessarabia, as Moldova is also the name of the adjacent region in Romania.<p>After the war, the soviet induced famine has hit us as well, but it hit Moldavians much harder. Hundreds of thousands of people have died of hunger and the official numbers are actually lower than what happened (my grandfather lived to tell me the story). But furthermore, we had to pay war reparations. And during their invasion on our territory, they&#x27;ve established what are called Sovroms, which were enterprises meant to deplete the resources of our country, with the effect that we&#x27;ve paid much, much more than the war reparations that were demanded. The soviets also mined us, for example we&#x27;ve shipped thousands of tons of uranium ore which ended up being used in their atomic bomb project.<p>In Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina the soviets did what Russians do best when invading a territory. They arrested, executed or deported to labour camps in Siberia hundreds of thousands of people and they also planted Russians on those territories, with the purpose of completely destroying their national identity. And this strategy of theirs does wonders. In the eyes of many Moldavians, the Russians are their &quot;brothers&quot; and Romania has had a &quot;colonial policy&quot; that has to be terminated. In return we&#x27;ve started granting them dual citizenship that has been their gate to the EU. We wouldn&#x27;t have any economic benefit in an eventual unification of course, the difference between Romania and the Republic of Moldova being the difference between western and eastern Germany in the eighties. This is why Ukraine is so divided btw, as this is their usual modus operandi and anybody that says Russia&#x27;s actions there are justified is either an ignorant or full of shit.<p>But back to the soviets, in Romania the result was poverty of course. But as a fun fact, even our former communist government was anti-Russian. For example at some point under Ceaușescu we declined to place our military forces under the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s joint command and we also refused to increase our military expenditures. We also refused to side with Russia on several political conflicts. And Romania was actually isolated from the rest of the Eastern block. We were the pariah of the Warsaw Pact. Our neighbors had it easier.<p>But by far the biggest damage that the soviets did to us is the mentality, which is the cause for the corrupted system we&#x27;ve inherited after the communist block fell. We&#x27;ve been recovering quite well, but it&#x27;s far from over, being much like cancer extirpation. And while our brethren from around our country are sometimes giving signs of missing the USSR, we don&#x27;t. In fact that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m proud of my country - we&#x27;ve always been at the intersection of empires, we&#x27;re still here, we&#x27;re still speaking a romance language and we hate everybody :-)",1438770234

Senior employees (with more than 10 years) would get even more (around 12). Which means you can take a week off every month. Now that is a lot of holidays. And these were enforced, you had to take all of these (for legal reasons, the company has to either pay the holidays to you, or force you to take them, and most of the time financial reasons dictate that it&#x27;s better if they don&#x27;t pay you).<p>Does unlimited vacation cover that?",1438769762

England and US not interfering in other countries would not have stopped other countries, most notably the USSR, in interfering with other countries. And the places where other countries, not England and US, had major influence, generally had much  bigger problems with civil rights, freedom and material well-being.<p>A significant indicator in this respect is the need to build walls to keep in the population in a country, because otherwise it would flee (and then call this &quot;anti-Fascist protection wall&quot;).<p>Your hyperbole about &quot;puppet Nazi government&quot; in Ukraine pretty much proves the point: the Poroshenko government, elected with rather clear majority in what is a relatively   free election,  does have its problems in corruption and whatever, but not any worse than the previous one, which was an actual puppet of Putin.<p>The EU has many problems, but being &quot;Nazi like&quot;   is not really  one of them.",1438769702

If you&#x27;re a permanent employee, your annual leave allowance (e.g. 4-6 weeks of holiday) covers a period of one year. If you don&#x27;t take that leave during the year, you lose it (you&#x27;re unlikely to get paid for the untaken leave).<p>Some companies may allow you to carry over <i>some</i> of that leave to the next year (e.g. a week) or may allow you to &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;buy&quot; some extra leave.

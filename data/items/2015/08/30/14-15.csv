This would, despite me knowing it&#x27;s not actually a drug, get rid of my withdrawals for a while; the placebo effect coupled with the &quot;ritual&quot; is very powerful. After I got clean, and the cravings went away, I would still have dreams of injecting drugs; not heroin, but anything. The behaviour was an addiction in and of itself.",1440946787

I&#x27;m finding, more and more, there are variables that contribute a lot to evo devo that have nothing to do with the specific sequence of coding regions, and more and more to do with the more cryptic (heh) regions.  Although we apply more and more DNA sequencing scaling, and more and more information theory- our rate of knowledge discovery appears to be flattening out.<p>I&#x27;ve realigned my research interests around cellular biology, specifically high throughput imaging of induced pluripotent stem cells, because it appears that those systems can provide us with a lot more direct experimental evidence, and that evidence is more consistent with the behavior of systems, than what can be extracted from DNA using the best statistical techniques.",1440946292

10143453,comment,10139696,10142915,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Thanks. I get that part. After digging a bit, it seems the implementation of IO is in fact a bit magical [1] (and not possible to implement in pure Haskell). GHC&#x27;s IO is implemented using a GHC-internal pseudo-state monad that uses a magical &quot;world&quot; value to enforce linear ordering — all of which, I&#x27;m guessing, would prevent the compiler from accidentally optimizing away or memoizing side-effectful functions?<p>Edit: I find it interesting that Haskell tutorials and books generally don&#x27;t try to peel away some of Haskell&#x27;s abstractions. Many texts will tell you that &quot;IO a&quot; represents an &quot;action&quot; and expect you to take this at face value, intead of explaining how this is distinguishable from a mere function, and how it&#x27;s implemented internally. For example, I would say one of the big eureka moments for any Haskell learner is to realize how lazy-evaluated graphs of functions can turn into linearly-ordered programs thanks to the transparent &quot;baton passing&quot; of monad chaining (IO in particular). But I&#x27;ve yet to find a text which articulates this idea very well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/9244715/632555"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/9244715/632555</a>",1440946063

In other words, once you have an AST, you don&#x27;t need to evaluate it, it&#x27;s enough to just read it.<p>This is not true for Python. An expression:<p><pre><code>    2+3\n</code></pre>\nyields:<p><pre><code>    Expression(body=BinOp(left=Num(n=2), op=Add(), right=Num(n=3)))\n</code></pre>\nAn AST here cannot be manipulated in its raw form here. To manipulate it - the representation itself - you&#x27;d have to parse it again or evaluate it to use special methods on AST objects.<p>So this is the practical definition of homoiconicity I came up with. You are of course free to disagree. I&#x27;m stressing &quot;practical&quot; here, because what I&#x27;m interested in is how easy it is to manipulate the AST to write macros. Homoiconicity for the sake of homoiconicity is of no interest to me.<p>PS. BTW, maybe I should base my argument on Lisp instead of Prolog. If you read the Wikipedia page carefully you&#x27;ll see the part on Lisp says the same thing I do above.",1440945449

They come at the cost, however, of significantly decreased freedom to refactor the implementation aggressively, which is why Discovery Testing recommends developers default to deleting-and-redeveloping local sub-trees of dependencies when requirements change significantly. This can result in reliably comprehensible designs, but with an increased base cost to requirement changes.\n```<p>I really agree with this.  I spent a few years working with a consulting company which preaches London-school TDD.  We did a lot of work in dynamic languages, and refactoring was particularly difficult because we had to make sure that all of our mocks (and other test code) lined up with the refactored APIs.<p>I hate to take the discussion here, but I wonder how Static Typing changes the experience of London-school TDD.

The key thing is you <i>don&#x27;t look at the two halves</i>.<p>Now, take one half at random, and send it to a person very far away.  Too far away to communicate easily at light speed.<p>Then, have the other guy look at what he has.  He will (of course) determine that it has either heads or tails.  Which means (of course) that the one you have is the opposite, either tails or heads.<p>Nothing weird yet, right?<p>The quantum weirdness comes in when you start doing variations of the tests to see what state the coin halves are in <i>before</i> you do the final measurement.<p>It turns out that any model you can think of (hidden variables, etc.) has physical consequences.  When you look for those physical consequences, you don&#x27;t see them.<p>What does that mean?<p>In this case, your coin half and the other coin half are in an &quot;indeterminate&quot; state.  They both have some properties of &quot;heads&quot; and they both have some properties of &quot;tails&quot;.  But their state is not <i>determined</i>.  It really is an unknown state.<p>And why move one half far away?<p>Because you can do tricks where you both measure the coin halves at the same time, or near the same time.  If (somehow) one measurement sent <i>information</i> from one coin to the other... that information has to transfer at light speed.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t.  When one half is measured, the other half <i>instantly</i> becomes the opposite state.  So far as anyone can tell, this process is instantaneous.  And any &quot;communication&quot; between the two halves has infinite speed.<p>The difficulty here is setting up systems so that they&#x27;re isolated, and nothing interferes with the test.  Then, doing all of the little measurements testing the edge conditions of your theory.<p>In short, everything you think you know is wrong.  The coin halves really aren&#x27;t <i>anything</i> until you look at one of them.  Then, <i>both</i> of them instantly become determined as heads/tails.",1440943426

It was a relative afterthought that surely must have helped, although how significant it has been to improve safety is hard to say. Cycling deaths dropped by about 20% - 25% since then, but that was a relatively minimal drop compared to say car deaths (80%) or even pedestrians.<p>It&#x27;s important also to know what this liability refers to, it&#x27;s not criminal (i.e. you go to jail because you&#x27;re in an accident that kills someone and you&#x27;re in the car, thus presumed liable. It&#x27;s not like that at all. You might go to jail but only for the right reasons, it&#x27;s not presumed.).

Apart from a possible increase in insurance premiums because the accident puts you in a &#x27;higher risk&#x27; category, there aren&#x27;t any consequences for the driver.<p>Which means that a lot of people in the Netherlands aren&#x27;t even aware of this rule.

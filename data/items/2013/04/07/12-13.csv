Nothing but nazis. In a first-person perspective, in a dark and gritty environment, in what was seen as very realistic. The policor backlash to the game's realism and grittiness - and the nazi-aspect - was huge. Wolfenstein was far, far more realistic and gritty than Halo has ever been, when put in historical perspective.<p>Then there's the fact that other realistic console shooters existed long before Halo came out. Take Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark for the N64, for instance. Two highly-realistic first person shooters, accompanied by successful multiplayer elements. Or Medal of Honor for the PS1. On the PC, too - take Rise of the Triad, one of the most violent games I can think of. Its multiplayer was simplistic, straightforward, and incredibly violent and gory.<p>I know it's all the rage to talk down on console gaming and games like Halo in particular, but the fact of the matter is that this kind of gaming didn't start with Halo, and had been around for a long, long time before it. Games like this have always existed alongside deeper and richer games, and that's a good thing - I like more intelligent and rewarding experiences, but after a long day or a stressful week, I just want to get some friends together and shoot zombies in Left 4 Dead 1/2 - just as I don't want every movie I see to be Philadelphia.

5507015,comment,5506571,5506963,6,0,unalone,,,"> God forbid other ""bro types"" enjoy games too.<p>Being a bro isn't, like, something you're <i>born</i> into. It's a certain mentality, a certain way of approaching the world. And while I like many facets of bro-dom, and enjoy the hell out of sitting down for some Smash with a couple of friends and a six-pack of Yuengling, there are some bothersome things about bro culture which that particular category of game emphasizes.<p>I mean, I'm critical of the FPS as a genre to some extent. It's fun as hell, but the nature of how the genre's set up has given it some kind of crappy limitations that no game I know of yet has managed to overcome. Even the best ones, like the Half-Life franchise, are limited in ways that bother me. I'm also not super fond of hardcore gaming: it's cool to watch from afar, but it's not an especially inclusive culture, and I fear that games like Starcraft and League of Legends help to scare away a broader variety of players. I'm not trying to say that gaming was perfect before Halo came out; I do think, however, that Halo helped to push a wave of bright designers in some shitty directions, and that game design has suffered as a result.<p>I'm critical of ""games that attract waves of bros"", if the bros seem to be the <i>majority</i> of person attracted to a game, in the same way that I'm critical of movies that attract that sort of person. Adam Sandler movies, for instance. I'm not saying everybody who likes Adam Sandler is a bad person, but I do feel that Sandler movies are kind of puerile and limited in a way that appeals to a particular type of person, and that, to the extent that they influence other creators, they do some damage to our culture. Adam Sandler's influence on movie-making has been less impactful than Halo's influence on game design, so the mentality described in the OP does bother me somewhat. To hear a guy working at Microsoft say ""my company specifically tried to manufacture this kind of experience to reach this kind of audience"" pisses me off.",1365338478

5506989,comment,5505266,5505266,7,0,brc,,,"Well, here is my stole and recovered story.<p>I was tending to my front garden one day when I see this massive shirtless guy walking up the road with a huge pot plant.  It was a weird scene so stuck with me.<p>Later that day two Thai guys walk up the road and ask me if I had seen anyone with a pot plant.  I tell them that I had, they tell me they own the local Thai restaurant down the road, and someone has stolen the big pot plants from out the front.  I gave them a description of the guy, but I told hem I didn't know where he went.<p>Anyway, next morning I get up, and one of my pot plants is missing.  After cursing for a while,  I sat staring out the back window musing on life.  When I realize what I am looking at is my pot plant in the back window of an apartment three buildings away.  A very low rent building known to house questionable types (the local nickname was junkie towers)<p>So I got out the zoom lens, took a a couple of pictures and hunted through my garden photos until I found a picture of the said pot plant.  I went down to the police station with the photos and told the my story.  Well, the police like nothing more than an open-and -shut case.  So they got a warrant, and went around and knocked on the door that afternoon.  What they found was a veritable treasure chest of goods taken from around the neighborhood, with pot plants being a particular specialty.  The police told me tehy're easy to sell at markets and don't have serial numbers etc.  but there were bikes, lawn furniture, you name it, anything that could be stolen without breaking and entering.<p>The guy turned out to have a warrant for his arrest for an assault charge, and a couple of other things.  The detective eventually asked if I woid testify at a hearing against him, which I agreed to, despite being a bit nervous of the size of the guy and his previous assault charge.<p>The big day in court came and the defending attorney made a big song and dance and tried to suggest that the fact that his client had an identical pot plant to mine was mere coincidence.  I suggested that the amount of combinations of pot plants was a very high number of permutations, to which he triumphantly declared that given there were possibly thousands like it, it coudld be merely similar and not exactly the same.  I countered with the fact that the odds of a similar pot plant showing up at the exact same time as mine went missing were too high to be mere chance.<p>Anyway, the guy went to jail, I forget how long now.  Th detective told me it was some of the best civilian witness testimony he had seen (I'm sure he says that to everyone).  I got my pot plant back, complete with evidence tag that I left on for fun until it disintegrated.<p>I must say, being in the witness stand was quite harrowing, having to point to someone in court and argue you're not a liar.  I had shaky and sweaty hands afterwards, a combination of nerves and adrenalin.  All that over a $20 pot plant, but a principle was at stake and was not going to let this creep get away with it.",1365338113

I switched to Node.js, CoffeeScript, Go, etc., but it is like everything I do could have been better or equally done in Perl and the tools were more mature. It's the same with all the new concepts and always makes me think about the MVC hype, when the concept of MVC was first named in the 70ies. It's a bit like with Smalltalk. It took like 30 years until people ralizing how good it is and reinventing it.<p>Same with ""Do things the Unix way"", pipes, KISS, NoSQL, distributed systems, all the stuff that the EC2 made popular. In that sense Computer Science is a really slowly developing science. At least it appears like that, maybe others are similar. I don't know.<p>And what is happening right now for example is making Javascript C, while the developers of C are stepping towards dynamic languages (Go). Also functional progrogramming laguages reappear, first Haskell, now Clojure reapear, cause it is cool for async stuff. LISP has been around for ages and Scheme is really beautiful and neither of them was ever slow or anything. Just look at Racket. It's pretty powerful, amazing to learn, performs at least okay and its IDE is pretty nice and cross-platform. It's amazing for doing the same stuff as Node.js and Scheme is one of the easiest languages to implement.<p>But back to Perl. It has a lot of problems. Nobody ever talks about how awesome CPAN and CPAN-Testers is (you don't even need to set up Travis CI). Nobody ever talks about it as functional programming language, even though there is a great book about. Another problem is that it is way more optimized for getting actual problems done and doesn't really perform too well, when you show your average snippet that looks mostly the same in every programming language out there.<p>The last flaw is that Perl is probably the hardest programming language to learn, because there are so many bad books out there. There are books like Modern Perl, that even are free, but also many really bad ones.<p>And a lot don't tell you about use strict; use warnings; use diagnostics; right away, even when they are what every beginner wants.",1365337640

5506960,comment,5506571,5506930,4,0,unalone,,,"Wolfenstein and Doom were simple, playful, colorful. Even as game devices became more powerful, there was a playfulness to FPSes that you can see in titles like Perfect Dark and the Unreal series.<p>One of Halo's major innovations was that it removed the health bar. In a shooter like Doom or Goldeneye, you have let's say 100 HP, and different weapons deal a different amount of damage. It's just like any fighting game with a health bar. Halo replaced that with a shield system, wherein being shot repeatedly wasn't a game-ender if you could get away long enough for shields to recharge. It changes the pacing of the game substantially, especially in multiplayer. The jittery feeling of older games, where every shot counts and you always have to be on the lookout for your opponent, was made both slower (because other players weren't constantly trying to get a shot on you and wear you down) and a bit more mindless (because once you got into a firefight, your only choice was to shoot the other person repeatedly or else there'd be no damage left whatsoever).<p>This complements the self-seriousness of the Halo games, which absolutely inspired the direction of the next-gen titles. Halo was ""grittier"" and less silly than previous shooters had been. In Wolfenstein, you were fighting enemies like robo-Hitler. In Doom, the enemies you were up against were inventive, silly, and fun. And the push towards realism was by no means inevitable. Look at Unreal Tournament 2004, which was a touted push towards enhanced graphics and gameplay that took advantage of modern systems, but which remains an utterly comical game. The violence is whimsical and comic; the levels are far more ridiculous than Halo's or Halo 2's. It's a pretty game, as far as that goes, but the prettiness is used for exaggeration rather than for ""grit"". So obviously that path was not only possible for games, but it led to quite a few very good games over the last decade.",1365337539

5506899,comment,5506571,5506571,27,0,unalone,,,"When I was a kid I hated the Xbox, hated Halo, and hated how it seemed to create a new model for playing games. It was released when I was in middle school, and I remember there being a sudden and abrupt shift in what kind of gaming mentality there was.<p>Prior to the Xbox, console games were largely focused on lush, whimsical landscapes with mechanics that required some puzzling to figure out. At least, the games that kids played, anyway; I know Unreal Tournament and Doom and Quake were big, but looking back I think those games all had a whimsy to them as well. The arsenal in Unreal is way sillier than anything Halo's ever had to offer (even Halo's energy sword seems kind of rote). And the major titles on the N64 and Playstation and Dreamcast were titles like Mario and Sonic and Crash Bandicoot – colorful worlds, puzzles often based on platforming. Developers like Nintendo and Rare had a knack for creating controls and visuals that seem to reward you for getting into them, so that even Rare's Goldeneye 007 felt like an utterly silly game. (Proximity mine in the toilet!)<p>When Halo came out, it was immediately apparent that this was Microsoft's grand new vision of gaming – ""realistic"" graphics, self-seriousness, achievements, and an ugly competitive edge. My memories of Halo are almost all multiplayer, obviously: generally, six kids sitting by a machine, two of them unhappy because they sucked and consequently were cycled out every other game, meaning they didn't get practice time either. The local teen center turned into a place where a bunch of bro-types would hook up their Xboxes and play each other all night, screaming at one another between rooms. The TV that was used for movies got co-opted into another Xbox resource, so eventually the whole place became a Halo pit. And online Halo (which started with 2, if I recall correctly) changed the dynamic yet again, in a way that's familiar to all of us: kids cussing at one another, players generally acting like little shits.<p>Some of that all would have happened without Microsoft's ""Xbox is a manly console for men"" marketing push. But you can absolutely look back and say that Microsoft influenced developers in a bad way. Sony made a push to ""cut Microsoft off"" with titles like God of War, which are similarly quote-unquote epic. Halo opened the door for Tom Clancy games, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, on and on. A number of older game developers decided, when they made the change from 2D to 3D, to pursue a similarly ""gritty"" realism. Now there's a gaming culture wherein genres are solidly defined and there's excruciatingly little variation between game mechanics, visual style, or design mentality, at least in the AAAs. And it's because of how relentlessly Microsoft pushed to divide the market.<p>The old designers either shifted their styles along with this, or they ran out of steam. Sega hasn't made a good game in over a decade – I won't even blame that on their pursuing a ""mature and edgy"" vibe with the Sonic franchise, though they seem to think that's what gamers want. They just ran out of ideas for where to take Sonic. Rare had a couple of late-era successes, mostly Viva Pińata, but the only thing they've done in five years is Kinect Sports games. And Nintendo? They still stick to their old style, but this many years on Nintendo's flaws as a game developer are showing. Aspects of their games which were totally forgivable when they were building for N64 or even Gamecube are starting to feel like irritatingly deliberate decisions on their part now. And you know what? That would be okay if Nintendo didn't sometimes feel like the <i>only</i> company still pushing that particular aesthetic. If they were one company among many, it wouldn't matter so much, but they're singlehandedly trying to push against the currents of every other game developer on the planet, and it's increasingly becoming clear that they're just not good enough to carry that all by themselves.<p>Obviously, this is a view of just a limited slice of gamer culture. Indie games absolutely borrow from the old-school design mentality more than they do from the Halo mindset; I've seen more whimsy and fun in a single Humble Indie Bundle than I've seen appear on the Xbox 360 since its release. Even there, though, you can feel the influence somewhat, and it's spoiled some games that I really wish I could have enjoyed (namely Bastion). And you do have both occasional lighthearted breakouts (Katamari Damacy) and games that use the self-serious mentality to incredible effect (Demon's Souls). This is a fad which will pass with time, though I'm not so pleased at the thought that our next big wave of developers are the ones developing for mobile and Facebook. Angry Birds and Farmville are not a fun influence. But that's just the way it goes. There'll always be good stuff if you know how to hunt for it. I just miss the fact that for a decade or so, the best games were at the top of the heap or close to it. I don't know if I realized how lucky I was as a kid until that ended. The 90s were a great time to grow up a young gamer.",1365336058

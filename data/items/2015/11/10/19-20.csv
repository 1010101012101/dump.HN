(At least the article didn&#x27;t, perhaps the researchers did.)  So here are some amateur stats, please check my work.<p>This article says that the prediction market correctly predicted 71% of the replication results of 44 studies, or 31 correct.<p>Assume the studies have a 50% chance of being replicable.  Then a random coin would predict a mean of 22 correct with a std dev of sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 * 44) = 3.3.  This sample has a z score of 2.72, which means there&#x27;s a probability of 0.003264 (0.3%) of the random chance approach being correct 71% or better.  So the result seems pretty significant.

That doesn&#x27;t mean violinists are all independently wealthy, they just have different priorities. If anything, hardware synths are much cheaper now in real dollars than they were during their vintage heyday. For instance, the 1973 Moog catalog lists their VCO module at $320.

Scientists&#x27; goal, after all is to reach some generally accepted view of <i>why</i> a result turned out a particular way and in what circumstances a different result might be yielded, which is more nuanced information than can be conveyed by a simple market price. Asking a pool of scientists how confident they are about a particular survey&#x27;s replicability and <i>why</i> - which is what the hypotheses are fundamentally all about - conveys more information than the prediction market.

BD probably has better control and Schaft has better actuators for human-sized robots, and I&#x27;d expected a new machine with the best of the two technologies by now.

The results of the Reproducibility Project were not remotely a surprise to Bayesian observers. People like Gelman have been pointing out for ages (and I mean back to the 1960s) that the prior probabilities in these fields is low and necessarily a lot of the results were false positives. With the rise of meta-analyses, it is possible to have informative priors for particular fields of psychology or for psychology as a whole, which would let you make much better predictions about whether a result was real. But you can&#x27;t use these in papers - authors are heavily biased towards using procedures or flat priors which are uninterpretable or grossly overestimate the evidence, and if you try to use any of the informative priors or more advanced models, they&#x27;ll nag you to death with a thousand objections and complain about double standards and subjectivity and how this time is different and (ironically) bias.

The manager may consider experience (up to six months), but as no more than 5% of each candidate&#x27;s grade, and this should be monitored by the business owner.",1447184433

The big problem - the one that has never been solved - is that software needs a programmable interface with fixed hardware controllers/knobs/sliders, but dynamic labelling. You can certainly imagine using modern controller and display technology to build such a thing - studio mixers have had similar features for years - but the price is always going to be prohibitive.<p>And there&#x27;s no standard display API for softsynths. (NI have tried to produce one called NKS, but it&#x27;s early days.)<p>And softsynths can have hundreds of parameters. Showing them all at once is always going to be a challenge. So most controller products either show nothing at all, or show a handle of items - like eight or so. Which are different for every synth.<p>If a softsynth supports OSC you can fake the tactility on an iPad, but the small size is a problem; I expect the Pro will be better, but still limited.<p>Music certainly works better when it&#x27;s tactile, but - as someone who used to design and build modular hardware, occasionally for cash - I now find modulars rather ridiculous, and certainly just as limiting in their own ways as any other technology.<p>They make great toys, but IMO the <i>spirit</i> of modulars - build completely new things to make new music - is a lot more alive in software than hardware now.",1447184324

Or at least not significant bonds.<p>I was in college when IM was still hot, before Facebook existed and continued on through grad school by which time it and Twitter had exploded. Over the years, the community at the universities changed. Students became more and more distant from each other, with less emphasis on social activities with those locally available to them. I&#x27;ve observed the same after nearly a decade in the workforce. The different attitudes, based primarily on age since social media use corresponds highly with age, is astounding. 40+ year olds are far more invested in ideas like office social events, group lunches or fun days, as a way to form bonds and also relax. 30-40 is pretty mixed.

Here&#x27;s my personal take on it. It is going to be a little harsh.<p>- First things first, Yeah, it is unfair to you. No question about it. A person of modest means has less chances to go ahead in life. Let not the hopefuls with rose colored glasses tell you life is going to be fair. That if you work hard, magic happens..There is just as much truth to it as flipping a coin. Look around. There are a lot of people who were born with a silver spoon, inherited property that is &quot;now&quot; worth a lot of money. And there are people who cannot seem to lift themselves out of their harsh life. There isn&#x27;t a rule book to follow that guarantees anything.<p>- The sharp sting of pain you may feel right now is because of your social conditioning; that you were led to believe that it\nain&#x27;t so, that hard work works!  It may or may not. No body knows, nor anybody is responsible nor will anybody will hold themselves accountable because they said so.<p>- Now that we have established that, I want you to really think why you want to go the US. Make money, learn or have a comfortable life? As Kamaal said, you are less likely to become rich as an engineer. If you wanted comfortable life, define for yourself what comfort is. There are downsides to being in the US. I have been here for 13 years now. No body talks about it, but you will feel lonely here. If you are one of &quot;us&quot; introverted types, who will keep to themselves, buddy, I have news \nfor you. It is going to be very harsh. That loneliness will affect the way you think. Also, I haven&#x27;t lit a Diwali cracker in all these years. You got to think about that.<p>- Instead, if you want to learn things, there ain&#x27;t a place like US anywhere. Concepts, things, ideas that seem unreachable are routinely done by people here. There you don&#x27;t have feel envious about your H-1B brethren. They are totally missing out on it. They are like cattle in a castle, who know no different, nor feel any difference. They are going to pee and poop on the throne without realizing it, just like cattle. There are blindingly smart people here. If you don&#x27;t get to work with some of them I feel you missed out the best thing that you can get by living here.<p>TL;DR - There are negatives and positives about living in the US. Think carefully if you really want to be here. And don&#x27;t expend energy feeling bad about yourself. Life is finite, harsh and unfair.",1447183680

The\neffectiveness of such ads relies on third-party brokers that maintain detailed user information,\nprompting privacy legislation such as “do-not-track” that would limit or\nban the practice. We gauge the economic costs of such privacy policies by analyzing\nthe anonymized web browsing histories of 14 million individuals. We find that 3% of\nretail sessions are currently initiated by ads capable of incorporating third-party information.\nTurning to content providers, we find that one-third of traffic is supported by\nthird-party capable advertising, and the rate is particularly high (91%) for online news\nsites. Finally, we show that for many of the most popular content providers, modest\nsubscription fees of $1-3 per month charged to loyal site users would be sufficient to\nreplace ad revenue.

Failing that, probably the best you can do is discharging the capacitors to something like half voltage, transferring three fourths of their energy into the arc and the projectile.<p>Your two arcs, assuming a length on the order of millimeters, are going to suck up minimally 50 or so of your volts, which is one reason to use higher voltage — so that the relatively fixed voltage drop across the arcs doesn&#x27;t hurt efficiency so badly.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_%28unit%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_%28unit%29</a> suggests that the maximum field you can reasonably expect to achieve across the rails is on the order of 500 milliteslas.  If you were going to keep using 400 volts, discharged down to 200 at the time of exit, then the optimum would be to have a back EMF at 500 milliteslas of about 150 volts at whatever the muzzle velocity is.  150V / (500 mT * 20mm) = 15 km/s, about Mach 45 and about twice the speed of, say, the International Space Station.<p>Okay, so if we have, say, 15kJ of projectile energy at 15 km/s, how massive is the projectile?  15 kJ / ((15 km/s)²/2) = 130 mg.  One difficulty with this is that small, light projectiles slow down more from air resistance, which is significant when you&#x27;re talking about flying fast enough to suffer ablative erosion from turning the air in front of your projectile into plasma.<p>So, you&#x27;re right.  22 grams means that the capacitors finish discharging far too early, so almost all the energy would be dissipated in the resistance of the arc.  Except actually I think most of it ends up in the flapping cables, which weigh a lot more than 22 grams.  You could probably get a noticeable improvement in the penetration just by tying the cables to boards so they can&#x27;t flap around and generate so much back-EMF of their own.  (They&#x27;ll still generate a significant amount due to self-inductance, which you can reduce but not eliminate by tying the opposite-direction cables very closely together.)<p>But wait!  What if the magnetic field is weaker?  Achieving 500 milliteslas is pretty hard, after all.  MRI machines have a field on the order of a tesla, which creates hazards of its own, though that&#x27;s mostly due to the field being distributed over a large volume.  If it&#x27;s only 50 mT, then you need the projectile to be going <i>ten times as fast</i> to build up that same 150 volts of back-EMF: 150 km/s.  And that, in turn, means that your sweet-spot weight goes from 130 mg to about 40 mg.<p>You could improve the situation for massive projectiles, at the expense of arc losses, by using a <i>lower</i> voltage and higher capacitance.  And of course a stronger magnetic field would help too, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very practical.<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;ve missed something in my calculations here.

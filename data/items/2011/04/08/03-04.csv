2422373,comment,2422145,2422299,6,0,EGreg,,,"Yeah I have no idea why they didn't even want to interview us.<p>I mean, I saw the batch of YC companies in winter 2010. I would humbly like to say that we seem to be closer to what YC <i>says</i> they are looking for, than several of those companies were.<p>For example, we applied in Winter 2010, YC rejected us without an interview, and then we went ahead and secured investment and launched and already have 80k users and nearly all ratings are 5/5 . Our apps are being used 30k times a day (in aggregate) so engagement is high. Not only that, but we are already generating profit. YC says they like entrepreneurs that hang in there.<p>Also, they say they like people who achieved a lot. I was a concert pianist when I was a kid and went to college at 14. ( <a href=""http://magarshak.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com</a> ). I normally don't say that but I thought I might as well just mention it. So I have no idea how their selection process works. If they had any concerns about the company, I would have been happy to talk to them in person. I think we at least would have warranted an interview.<p>I personally think YC made a ""wrong decision"". But it may very well be that the selection process has other things that I am not aware of. For example, they may have so many applicants that they are looking for specific things they did NOT mention on the site, and these may be weighted more heavily.<p>Anyway, we are a bit surprised, but that's about it :)",1302235032

If it looks like crap, you only have to pay for 400 hours of programming.  Android users don't care, so you make more return on your investment by neglecting design.<p>Apple users all have blogs about the virtues of serif fonts versus sans-serif fonts, so you are not going to sell your apps (or get ad views) if your app looks like crap.  Therefore, paying the designer is worth the cost.<p>Also, Java programmers are a different demographic than Objective-C/Cocoa programmers.  Java programmers mostly use Windows, which doesn't have a UI or ""user experience"".  (The experience is mostly in removing spyware.)  iPhone developers, by definition, can only use Apple products, thus self-selecting for people that care a little about UI.<p>Additionally, the finance doesn't really make sense for Android apps.  Why would I waste 6 months of my time (which is around $100k) on an app that nobody will pay for when I could write bullshit software for an investment bank and get a guaranteed paycheck no matter what my UI looks like?<p>Android users get what they want: cheap.  iPhone users get what they want: eye candy.<p>(Just to be clear, I love Android.  But ""user experience"" doesn't mean much to me.  As long as I can see my calendar and ssh to my machine at home over OpenVPN, I don't really care about anything else.)",1302234896

It's easy to do when so many people seem to be succeeding, not realizing that's a function of so many more people simply trying.<p>When we decided to leave and go back east, it only took about 200 miles of driving to see that mental bubble burst. Of COURSE you can be successful elsewhere. It all depends on your attitude, persistence and motivation.<p>I've made it my personal mission to foster the tech startup community here in Charlotte, meeting as many talented people as I can and bringing them together. I started our local chapter of Hackers and Founders, and frankly I've been shocked at the level of energy and talent I've discovered. There are plenty of folks participating in startups here and there are also plenty of folks with money to bankroll the ideas. Even if you need money from outside of Charlotte, getting on an airplane is easy.<p>At the end of the day, I choose to live here because it's fun, friendly and has access to the beach, mountains and great weather.

The incremental costs of serving an additional customer are negligible, while development costs are (relatively) fixed.  Thus the relative adoption rates of Android vs iOS customers becomes decreasingly important as the Android user base continues to grow.<p>Despite the apparent swing in popularity of my original statement, I stand by it.

Whether it's because of battery life, lousy app selection, annoying add-ons by the carrier, or clunky app design.<p>Sure, slimy salespeople hired by the carriers are pushing Android phones and probably lying about features and quality just as they lie about plan details, etc.  Yes they're selling a lot of (mediocre) phones to a lot of naive (or optimistic) people who trust the Google name based on their experience with search or gmail.<p>I predict a huge backlash as more and more consumers realize they were hoodwinked and should have just gone with an iPhone.  Take the Evo 4G for example... the phone shipped unable to even last a whole day on a full charge (with moderate use).  This is unconscionable.  Clearly nobody who was in a postion to do something about this test drove one of the phones for a few days before moving forward with all the hype and marketing.<p>I think this will all bite Google when few people decide to upgrade to a new Android phone.

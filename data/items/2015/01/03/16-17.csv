I will admit that it takes some time to get acquainted with Sencha Touch intricacies. If you pay no attention to resource control (primarily: how many elements you are creating without destroying them) you can get a bad experience. Of course, we&#x27;re talking about apps that don&#x27;t require a lot of non-traditional components. I think this route is the best choice for fast prototyping of cross-platform mobile apps. And, I think it&#x27;s the ideal choice, unless you have a large enough team and budget to code out native versions for you target platforms. Here is an example of an app I did for a startup I was working on. It uses CoffeeScript + Sencha + PhoneGap + some custom native plugins for PhoneGap.<p><a href=""https://github.com/celwell/wesawit-st2-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/celwell/wesawit-st2-app</a><p>When you start to veer away from a top-notch framework like Sencha Touch, you can run into a lot of performance issues that a good framework would take care of for you.

I guess you could just encode the video twice, no?<p>Your GPL example I like a lot though; I never heard that argument before. One problem I have with it is that the line between users and developers can be a little blurry, or, in my case doesn&#x27;t exist at all. I&#x27;m also not sure why you&#x27;d need the GPL license to ensure the users&#x27; freedom. Say OpenOffice is MIT licensed. I&#x27;m a developer, I fork it and make changes that I don&#x27;t publish because I don&#x27;t have to. How does that relate to your (the user&#x27;s) freedom?

8831049,comment,8830810,8830810,0,0,hluska,,,"First, it is hard to take this article seriously when the author seems confused by what PG and Y Combinator actually do. For example, consider these sentences:<p><i>One obvious difference between Paul is that he’s an employer and I’m an employee.</i><p><i>We have too many people coming out of school who cannot find jobs, and not enough tech types for Y Combinator (or my various employers) to hire.</i><p><i>What would happen if a few large companies (let’s start with Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe from the lawsuit; I’d add Y Combinator, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle), all announced they would raise salaries in all H-1B categories by 5%/year for 10 years, while the US reduced H-1B visas by 10% per year for 9 years, ending at 8,500 (10% of current volume)?</i><p>In light of this severe misunderstanding, it is no wonder that this article makes so little sense. The author seems to make the point that H1-B visas tend to go to more average programmers. And, then argues that if companies want to attract more qualified people, they should start paying exorbitant salaries to top people. The problem is that they already do this and there is still a scarcity of truly amazing programmers.<p>This isn&#x27;t all that complex, or am I missing something?",1420301412

Really great programmers will help drive product decisions that can change direction of the company and the ultimate success/failure. The more responsibility a programmer has over product/quality/cost/delivery schedule, the more they can be worth a huge amount.<p>2) Really great developers are really paid a lot more than less good ones. Smart developers with no experience are paid more than what he suggests. A smart college grad can get paid 6 figures without any experience in the right job (not ~50K). People who prove their worth can ultimately get paid a lot more. However, they&#x27;re pay will usually be increased above their peers outside of salary using RSUs/options that will be very valuable but vest over time. That said most companies don&#x27;t pay programmers their true value, and it often takes a long time for a developer to fully demonstrate their value and develop a name for themselves.<p>TBC, I&#x27;m not arguing anything about immigration.",1420301369

8831025,comment,8830083,8830083,0,0,bsenftner,,,"Photogrammetry is very common in film VFX, where I was first exposed to it nearly a decade ago. There is a very interesting technical merger taking place between photogrammetry, computer vision, and machine learning. My company, www.3D-Avatar-Store.com, is one such company where we&#x27;ve trained neural nets to perform the entire complicated photogrammetry process, and then relax it&#x27;s technical constraints, allowing for less than ideal source imagery. This &quot;technical merger&quot; is creating neural nets that &quot;know&quot; a given class of object, and are able to reconstruct them given less than complete information. This is achieved by training the neural nets to already know about their class of object, enabling them to &quot;recognize&quot; when presented with one, and then fill in the missing information not present in the limited source photo(s).<p>At the 3D Avatar Store we&#x27;ve trained our neural nets to reconstruct human faces and heads. It is a photogrammetry process deep inside, but 95% of the process described by Andrzej Poznanski is automated. There is a manual step where one approves and/or corrects the identified facial feature outlines while generating an initial 3D reconstruction. Because we use a facial recognition neural net as a starting analysis, the jawline is hard to recover accurately (facial recognition ignores jawlines). So we have a &quot;post reconstruction&quot; series of deformation tools to allow the user to fine tune or exaggerate their reconstructed 3D form.<p><a href=""https://3d-avatar-store.com/A-peek-at-new-Fuse3DAvatars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://3d-avatar-store.com/A-peek-at-new-Fuse3DAvatars</a><p>And the best part of a process like this is all &quot;3D Avatars&quot; created by our process share the same topology: meaning they can be morphed between one another and controlled by the same animation rigs.<p>I love this &quot;Visual Revolution of...&quot; blog post.

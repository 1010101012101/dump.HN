In the mean time, we&#x27;ll send you an RSA security token fob for two factor authentication if you&#x27;d like&quot;. Thanks but no thanks, I&#x27;d rather not add another item to my keychain to make up for your website&#x27;s lackluster password requirements.<p>I never knew that their website would truncate passwords at 8 characters, but just checked and sure enough it works. This is indicative of the ridiculousness of the 8 char limit, but given the 8 char limit, I don&#x27;t think it weakens their system at all.",1400036328

The atmosphere in the air was part humor and part insight, not some seriousness to mean that older people are stupid in anyways.<p>The most important thing he said that day I can remember was that his company was, no matter what, a &quot;software&quot; company, and even his chief legal team lawyer codes as well, and stressed the importance of understanding and doing coding.<p>Now, I&#x27;m 32, and made a lot of money in my late 20&#x27;s, and also in my early 20&#x27;s, but lost everything right before I turned 30 in some legal grow op investments in California.  I&#x27;ve never had a successful startup, even though I had a successful affiliate program in college, and am beginning to feel old.<p>When I was 22, in college and making more than a plastic surgeon because I figured out how to generate oodles of mortgage leads online during the mortgage bubble, I not only felt different, the world itself was different.  Everybody seemed to be happier, friendlier.  The world is just simply a different place when you&#x27;re making lots of money and building things, whether its in internet marketing or in the startup world.  The world is a very shitty place when you&#x27;re stagnant, barely making any money, and just rotting away some like dead animal.<p>Its hard to even think straight any more.  It&#x27;s like a part of me is just not there that once was.  I exercise and eat healthily, but its just not the same.  Maybe I need to start getting on some HGH treatment, but that&#x27;s nearly 30k a year.  Its probably more mental than hormones.<p>So yeah, if you&#x27;re over 30, you&#x27;re a slow old man, only if you let it get to you deep down.",1400032946

7741811,comment,7739872,7741360,1,0,gwern,,,"> One of the cornerstones of selective breeding is systematic inbreeding. This brings out recessive traits and encourages the accumulation of what we would normally consider mutations and errors.<p>It may bring out recessive traits, but why would it increase the mutational load? Those are no more useful in a turnspit dog than in a sheepherding dog. If your dog is growing 3 eyes because of a particularly nasty de novo error, that&#x27;s going to be selected against both by the breeder and by other pressures.<p>> Consider how we would view humans who had been selectively bred long enough to change their form as drastically as some dog breeds have been changed! We would be horrified by them. However, the deformities accumulated by this population, when reunited with a larger population, would soon disappear.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of physiological variation among humans; are we really horrified by Pygmies?<p>> First, you have to get your hands on the raw materials. i.e. Find dogs who already can smell the stuff.<p>Not that hard, since they&#x27;ve already been reported, implying that they&#x27;re not so rare as to not exist.<p>> Next, you need to figure out how to reliably train dogs with the ability to smell cancer to actually do so and communicate the results, and you&#x27;re probably going to have to do this with dogs you don&#x27;t necessarily know actually have the ability.<p>Solved by animal trainers eons ago: rewards for correct selection. How do you think drug dogs are trained?<p>>  I&#x27;d be willing to bet few oncologists will say things to their patients like, &quot;Gee, you&#x27;re absolutely riddled with cancer! How would you like to help out with our cancer-sniffing-dog breeding program before you snuff it?&quot;.<p>Culture cancer in dishes or something. Somehow, getting cancer samples doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge existential problem for cancer researchers.<p>> Finally, you have decades or even centuries of work ahead of you before you&#x27;ll have a breed on your hands with greater ability than random gifted individuals in the greater dog population.<p>Decades is completely ordinary a timeline in medical research, so not a problem. And I suspect it&#x27;ll be on the former rather than latter timescale: you only want one thing, and selection can act very fast. Consider how long the Russian fox experiment took, for a much more trivial goal.<p>> It would be much faster and far more useful to determine how dogs detect cancer and develop instruments directly based on that method.<p>Oh, and how well has that worked so far...? Perfect, meet better... Really, you&#x27;re making this all out to be much harder than it&#x27;d actually be.",1400032921

143928,comment,143148,143549,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"No, we totally appreciate your input here, and I think that you'll find that being Digg's first technical guy carries a lot of street cred.  Your insight is appreciated.  And, even though things may not be looking great for you now, I wouldn't be suprised if you did better for yourself the second time around.<p>Although on a cautionary note, I'd be careful what I post here, because it does tend to get picked up.  Comments I've made got picked up by ValleyWag, and that's almost never a good thing.",1206265573
143926,comment,143829,143919,0,0,henning,,,"""At this writing Cheap Threads is beta software. I am releasing it without having yet used it in a real application, beyond the artificial drivers used for testing and development.""<p>This is not a compelling alternative to what Erlang has to offer.<p>Supposing you do get cheap concurrency in place, you still have to implement the logic for your application, and you're going to do that in C. If you're writing something roughly as low-level as a kernel or a device driver, super. If it's a business application with rapidly changing requirements, good luck.",1206264595

This is the perfect scenario for tool tips and other features that can explain usage.",1206264367
143922,comment,143148,143623,0,0,davidw,,,"Paul says: ""I had no idea the Zenters used to leave our meetings disagreeing with all my suggestions"".  That's ""not pushing back"", and of course that regards something more or less technical where they could have, pretty easily.  But what I think I'm trying to get at is a general world view that really has nothing to do with YC.  It's easy in SV to get kind of lost in the region's distorted reality field, and it's healthy to get out and see something else once in a while.<p>I certainly don't know PG well enough to know what he does and what he thinks... but while I did like the recent jobs essay, I agree that there's a hint of getting a bit wrapped up in the startup world.<p>But then again, it would be pretty boring to read about ""different kinds of jobs are good, and so you should choose the job best for you"", wouldn't it.",1206264216

You mean MAJOR VARIANT of minor aside!<p>pg: No, I didn't say that.<p>you: Oh, sorry. My bad.<p>pg: No problemo, cdr-erino!<p>See?  Easy! :-)",1206263660

This would get you a working prototype without having to worry about the nuts-and-bolts problems that you'll face if you start from scratch. You could use this to hammer the kinks out of your concept with reasonably little coding effort. Even if you don't want to use Thunderbird in the end, it would help you find out whether your idea will work and if it is worth the effort of reading all those bloody RFCs.",1206263316

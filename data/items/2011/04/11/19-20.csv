2434116,comment,2433424,2433940,3,0,alexqgb,,,"@dhimes - I think the point is that valuations are something others apply. In the case of a stock offer (where the company and the issuer are - presumably - working together for their mutual benefit) disclosure tends to be far deeper and more detailed than it is in a case where a hostile, and possibly devious party is attempting to inflict/extract maximum damages. So it's not about lying, per se. Rather, it's about providing the least information possible, and letting the negotiations center on the whatever value the plaintiffs can infer from that disclosure.<p>It's also worth remembering that the value (which is always changing) is based on factors beyond FB's knowledge or control. Given the opacity of GS, no one outside of that firm really knows what related transactions they may be a part of that are also contributing to the value they place on FB. So even if the Winkelvi did have all the information that GS had, that still doesn't mean they'd be able to value the company in the same way. In other words, they're just saying ""well, if GS sees more value than we do, and for reasons we don't begin to understand, we want a piece of THAT action - even though we'd already settled for a different price before they got involved.""<p>It's a bit like selling your house to a guy who fixes it up, then flips it for even more money, only to have you sue a year later to ""correct"" the price you received. In a word, absurd.",1302551873

The AMA lobbied for medical practitioner licensing in the earlier 1900s on the grounds that they would set high standards for future doctors. The end result was different:<p>""The licensing boards in each state soon began refusing licenses to health professionals who had not been trained at one of the 'approved' medical schools. Only half of the existing medical schools were approved, so most of the others had to close their doors by 1920. By 1932, almost half the medical school applicants had to be turned away. Those who apprenticed, went to unapproved schools, or developed their own therapies were stopped- at gunpoint, if necessary- from healing. As a result, the number of medical doctors per 100,000 people dropped from 157 in 1900 to 125 by 1929. Specialists, such as midwives, were usually forbidden to practice unless they had a full-fledged medical degree.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/chap5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/chap5.html</a>",1302551572

2434090,comment,2433424,2434009,4,0,grellas,,,"Restricted stock, as relevant to 83(a) and 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, is a form of property granted in exchange for services. It is not taxable immediately under 83(a) upon its receipt by the service provider while it remains subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Once that risk lapses, it is subject to tax. Thus, anyone whose grant vests over, say, 48 months at 1/48th per month would be potentially subject to up to 48 taxable events, one for each increment of stock that vests over the 4 years. Of course, people don't want to be subject to this, and that is why they file 83(b) elections. With an 83(b) election, the restricted stock recipient elects to be taxed at once on the full value of the grant on the day it was made, notwithstanding that it remains subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Thus, when you get your million share grant at $.001 per share, you elect to pay tax on the difference between the $1K you paid for it and the $1K that it is worth on the date of grant. Hence, you pay tax on $-0-.<p>In this context, the ""substantial risk of forfeiture"" analysis is not relevant. The idea of ""risk of forfeiture"" applies <i>only</i> when someone already owns stock and can lose it. Here, the Winklevoss brothers never owned the FB stock (nor were they receiving it in exchange for any services they were performing and so neither 83(a) nor 83(b) applies).",1302551434

We've been experiencing pretty strong growth and through this are identifying the sticking points and working through them as fast as we can.<p>The isolated code issue has been a big issue, and we're addressing this through calls like merge_gem(), and soon merge_mailer().  It's a challenging task, and we see the gaps, but we're improving every day.<p>Runtime: this is also a top priority. We're working with each and every customer to ensure that their workers execute quickly. 3 seconds vs 30-60 is totally unacceptable and we won't leave you hanging here.<p>Queue speed: we're prototyping alternatives to http queuing which will dramatically speed up queue times.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg for roadmap... Great work on HireFire. I see cases for both. Potentially massive parallelization on SimpleWorker (hundreds if not thousands of concurrent jobs), advanced scheduling needs, etc.<p>Anyways - we're listening - so any and all feedback is well received. If anybody has needs outside HireFire, in conjunction with, or otherwise, shoot me a line and we'll get you up and running at no cost to start.<p>Chad Arimura\nchad[at]simpleworker.com<p><a href=""http://www.simpleworker.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simpleworker.com</a>",1302549269

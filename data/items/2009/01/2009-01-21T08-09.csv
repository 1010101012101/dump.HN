By creating some sort of device which provides these things you are essentially eliminating their meaning in the process. How could you truly appreciate them if they were simply handed to you?<p>Everybody wants happiness, comfort and love. We want them so badly that we spend our whole lives trying to acquire and keep them. When you start handing them out, why then do we live?",1232527579

442978,comment,442571,442571,0,0,albahk,,,"Something I thought of when I was studying engineering at Uni (I dropped out) was to fit a small device onto the accelerator cable of a car that can apply varying degrees of tension to the pedal.  This device would be moderated by the computer in the car to ""condition"" the driver to adopt a more fuel-efficient driving style.  If you drive in a non-fuel efficient manner, there would be more ""drag"" on the pedal, thus requiring slightly more effort.  The ""sweet spot"" of minimal drag/tension would encourage drivers to maintain a driving style which is the most fuel-efficient speed/acceleration.<p>This idea depends upon the ability to condition people over time in an almost subconscious manner.  Not sure if it would work or not.",1232526903

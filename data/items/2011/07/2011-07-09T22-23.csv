2746462,comment,2746360,2746360,13,0,mechanical_fish,,,"What is the difference between a fiction writer and a troll?<p>One of them spins fictional tales which, while based on enough facts to help the reader suspend disbelief, are ultimately driven by the desire to create a specific emotional effect. Every word is calculated, every character (including the narrator) is designed with an eye toward eliciting a specific response from the reader. A successful work invites the reader to collaborate in the construction of a mental universe which is vivid enough that the reader truly and deeply experiences the emotional state that the author is trying to evoke. Of course, once the reader escapes the spell and gets a good night's sleep, he or she usually recognizes that any similarity between the fictional world and the actual world is likely to be purely coincidental... although some works of fiction are so powerful that the reader's personality is forever altered, only sometimes for the better.<p>Whereas the other one gets paid by a publisher.<p>So let me issue the usual warning: The reason we don't feed trolls is not just to discourage them. Feeding trolls is unhealthy for <i>you</i>. They drag you away from reality and (see xkcd/386) interfere with your sleep. We must be cautious about trying to conclude <i>anything</i> about the nature of education, credentials, society, or <i>even the troll itself</i> from the words of a troll, or while under the immediate influence of the words of a troll. All we can conclude is that we have buttons and those buttons can be pressed.",1310249853

I welcome corrections.)<p>pf has two different packet shaping mechanisms: CBQ, and prio. CBQ allowed you to allocate amounts of bandwidth, but didn't include prioritization. So, you could, say, set aside X Mb/s for ssh, Y for http, and so on, with lots of borrows and congestion management and other neat stuff.<p>With prio, you had to give up allocation, but you got to say instead that a particular rule always got bandwidth priority over other rules. So, if your web server is getting hammered, and you have ssh prio 7, you can still get into your machine no problem.<p>To use either scheduler, you had to specifically ""turn it on"" in your config file and essentially build a little structure for it. It <i>sounds like</i> -- having just glanced at Henning's messages and patches -- the ""turn it on"" and structuring steps have been eliminated for prio. Although on the surface that looks like a small change (and user-wise it probably is), it's still a pretty big change in the pf internals.<p>What I <i>hope</i> -- and can't tell yet -- is that this is going to get us a step closer to being able to use both scheduling mechanisms. They are complementary systems and it sucked a little to have to choose the features from only one or the other.<p>Either way, this is the kind of news that makes me really really miss working with pf. I prefer it, a lot, over iptables, which makes me grouchy on a regular basis.",1310249522

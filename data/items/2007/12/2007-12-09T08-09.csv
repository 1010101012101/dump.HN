The PHP binary from apt-get was 5.1.2 and pdo_mysql wouldn't install out of the box (I had to comment out part of the install script). The lighttpd binary was also pretty old (1.4.11 I think) and had a bug specific to Ubuntu/Debian that caused major performance problems with fastcgi; I had to build the latest version from source. It's still workable but it just seems like Fedora is a lot more PHP-friendly.",1197189577

87426,comment,87342,87342,0,0,pc,,,"Like a lot of articles on the topic, this one misrepresents (or misunderstands) the Turing Test. In a _true_ Turing Test, the humans aren't blindly conversing with the assumption that their conversant is human -- they're actively seeking to verify the presence of a human.<p>The non-Turing Test described in the article merely requires that contenders don't do anything blatantly inhuman, and is obviously trivial to ""pass"". Any contender for the actual Turing Test will do so with ease.<p>(I built a bot a few years ago that stored strings from IM conversations, and used the tokens of the preceding phrase as keywords for future lookups. It's hard to image a more naive algorithm, and yet, as in SlutBot's case, it didn't take long for most people to assume it was human.)<p>Also, with regard to SlutBot's use... is it still entrapment if the bot does it?",1197188887

87421,comment,87418,87418,0,0,hwork,,,"I realize this is seemingly more gadgets than hacking news, but not for me.  The Aibo, the goofy, expensive toy that Sony discontinued in 2006, was my introduction to hacking in college.  For two years, I hacked this thing with a fury I'd never known.  I got into 'RoboCup', aka Robot Soccer, and making these Aibos autonomous were my mission.  Through this project, I learned how to code, run a project, and succeed.  After two years of hard work, this summer my team, the fiery Northern Bites from small Bowdoin College, won the World Championship of robot dog soccer.  Now I'm in Silicon Valley trying to take all that I learned from RoboCup and do something big.  The chance of a new Aibo, a robot I got to know a lot of, brings back a lot of hacking memories for me.  Anyways, just thought I share.  Rock on.",1197187416

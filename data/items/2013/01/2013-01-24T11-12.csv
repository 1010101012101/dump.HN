5109069,comment,5106767,5108883,4,0,dasil003,,,"It's shocking the historical parallels between Node vs Rails and Rails vs Java.  You'd think given the history of Rails that its practitioners (me being one for 7 years) would be more careful about dismissing a new technology for not being as ""mature"" and that you can ""do all the same stuff"" in Ruby.<p>I mean lets be honest: there is no outright revolution in Node anymore than Rails was a revolution, rather it's a matter of bringing useful ideas to the table in a convenient package.  Node has particular strengths that Ruby does poorly, and we need to be intellectually honest about that rather than contorting ourselves to find ways to justify why ruby is always >=.<p>A lot of this animosity seems to come from a passion for the craft and subconscious fear of perhaps not using the best tool, and thus a need to justify to oneself why another tool is inferior.  However if you look dispassionately, most of these conclusions are reached from highly asymmetrical knowledge and experience, and often rest on matters of taste.  The hatred of Javascript for instance, is largely a matter of taste since its prototypal inheritance gives it a similar dynamic power to Ruby, just slightly uglier.<p>All that said, your original post also seems to come ever so slightly from a defensive position.  Some arguments don't seem well argued, like why you thinks Rails is not good for APIs and heavy JS front-end (Rails has never been great with its Javascript, but it also mostly does the right thing to stay out of your way).<p>In any case though, I think we all have a tendency to overthink this stuff (me included).  If the goal is to do good work, I think 1% of your time should be spent looking at new ideas and latching onto interesting new things, and 99% should be spent actually executing the craft.",1359028579

In fact they were much better than Chrome's tools until about 2 years ago. Chrome's tools still even have some annoying features that are better in IE. Yes, I'm looking at you watch variables. Also much prefer their 'trace styles' over Chrome's massive list of every selector ever.<p>With all that said, Chrome's my development browser of choice these days. The right click inspect element is the killer feature over IE's dev tools. For some reason I've never got on with Firebug.

Even though Steve Jobs is an inspiration for me, I actually agree a lot with Ed Colligan here.<p>A couple thoughts:<p>- It's definitely possible for both companies to have awesome teams. No one person is going to make or break either team.<p>- Employees should have a right to work where they want to. Part of this means that if I am a skilled employee, I'll get offers to come work for other companies. If I engage in a conversation, then it's perfectly alright for the company to actively recruit me. On the flip side, if I decline, they should back off. But, at the end of the day, it should be my choice. Both the company and employee need to win (which might be hard at times).<p>- Part of living in a free, capitalist, democratic society is the beauty that if an employee tries to leave, you can try to persuade them otherwise. This can be done in a variety of ways, but it comes down to taking the more appealing offer (that doesn't just have to be pay and title, but can also be the values of the company or the employee's lust for working at a particular company or their freedom to have a little less bureaucracy and instead experiment with new ideas, etc. etc.)<p>- I love the jab at the end, where Ed claims that Palm is not interested in getting or using confidential Apple information and also informs their employees of their duties to their previous employers",1359027720

Other editors feel like toys in comparison.<p>I'm siding with mrb on this one. Learning flexible tools gives you immense power in comparison to low-learning-curve ones. The time invested is considerably smaller than the time spent figuring out how to solve edge cases with simple tools. This is something which appears to be impossible to communicate to people with words. Learn some of these tools and you will see for yourself.<p>By 'learn' I do not mean, for example, becoming familiar with hjkl for navigation in Vim. I mean mastering the tools to the point that using them requires no effort - where just as you experience the impulse ""I want a glass of water"" and without any effort go to fetch one, you experience the impulse ""I want to create a new class in file X, navigate to file Y then modify method Z"", your fingers start moving and suddenly you're done. I get frustrated watching my IDE using co-workers write code - it takes them a very long time to do very simple things. Their tools are narrow and do not facilitate expression - they constrain it.<p>Pre-emptive strike on the argument that code completion is better - Eclim (Eclipse with a Vim frontend) solves this problem very well. Nonetheless, I have it installed and configured but can barely find a use for it.",1359027121

I can probably see that point of view, but I do disagree with quite a lot of the details--I believe a market works great in certain specific and relatively small scale circumstances, especially since it's a relatively effort-free system to set up, outside of those domains, the modus of ""the market"" seems to starts diverging more and more wildly from what I consider ""good"", or ""to the benefit of those whose lives it affects""--but that becomes a philosophical discussion that might be a bit OT here.<p>We can totally agree that academia's approach is similarly imperfect.<p>> They will even be rewarded again if they did something the market needed but didn't know it wanted.<p>Here you are conflating again ""what the market needs/wants"" with ""good""<p>> In any case, you are not spending the public money, and you are redeemable (you can be fired or run out of your own money) which discourages waste.<p>That's not entirely fair reasoning.

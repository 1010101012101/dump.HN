9371871,comment,9371039,9371039,0,0,karmacondon,,,"None of these things seem like problems that need to be corrected (within reason [1]). Part of being a member of a minority group is that members of the majority group will never speak or behave in exactly the way you would like. That&#x27;s the nature of living in a heterogeneous society.<p>There will never be equal proportions of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or culture in any group. In the interest of everyone being able to work together effectively, we all have a responsibility to draw a line between preference and abuse. People who become abusive should obviously be castigated or removed for the good of everyone. But if we place too much emphasis on appeasing the preferences of every group or individual, we&#x27;ll be too busy focusing on choosing just the right word in every situation to get things done. Effective communication is hard enough as it is. Parsing every word because it might potentially offend someone only makes the problem worse. Everyone has a cross to bear and no one will ever feel that they fit in perfectly. Some times toes get stepped on, and that&#x27;s ok.<p>I think the term &quot;unintentionally sexist&quot; says it all. There was a time when open and aggressive *-ism was common, but that kind of thing is generally no longer acceptable in polite or professional society. It seems like the best thing for all of us would be to focus on what we have and common and what we can do to get along, instead of publishing lists of &quot;I hate it when group X says thing Y&quot;.<p>[1] clearly numbers 6, 9 and 10 on this list are right out. there are several others that might not be acceptable depending on the context/wording",1428980174

The fault there lies not with the student, but with the computer / network security.\n</code></pre>\nThis is incorrect and your reasoning here is faulty. It is diametrically opposed to how the community at large views this issue. If we treat children in this way, and then when the clock strikes 12 and they turn 18 they are suddenly treated in the exact opposite way!! A 180 degree flip. According to your logic, within in the school setting its a harmless prank and the blame squarely lies with the school. However, turn 18 and perform the exact same actions (simple intrusion) on an corporate server. Guess where the (legal) blame will lie??<p>I took issue with comments that the actions were a harmless prank. As adults, and particularly as teachers our duty is to help shape the next generation of ethical citizenry. Laughing this incident off and applying a token punishment would send the wrong message.<p>In many jurisdictions unauthorized computer access is a crime. If a student gained access to a NSA computer, do you think law enforcement would treat it as a harmless prank? Even if no data was destroyed or tampered with. The act of intrusion <i>is itself a serious matter</i>.<p>The school has a duty to use this as an opportunity to<p>1. Update their network security (obviously!)<p>2. Educate students that they can end up in prison (even as minors!) if they break into the wrong computer network.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean applying an out of proportion punishment to this student in order to make an example of him. This means applying a fair and proportionate response which, and i&#x27;&#x27; say it again... sits between the 2 extremes of &quot;harmless prank&quot; and felony offense.<p>The issue I&#x27;ve had all along is with brushing this away as harmless. Unlawful intrusion is a crime. As teachers we would do a poor job preparing our students for the real world by treating it, within the school setting, as a &quot;harmless prank&quot;<p>A harmless prank is throwing a water balloon at someone. Breaking and entering (digital or otherwise) is not in this category.<p>In addition, the law does not treat the flimsiness of the lock as a mitigating circumstance. You can protect your physical property with a $2 lock and, in the eyes of the law anyone circumventing this would be guilty of break and enter, in the same way as if they broke into a far more fortified premises.<p>laughing away the student&#x27;s actions as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; would be to miss a valuable learning opportunity for everyone involved!<p><pre><code>   > What the student in this case did was effectively provide free pen-testing\n</code></pre>\nThis was not a noble white-hat! If the student found an exploit and then went straight to the teacher to inform them, do you think this would have ever made front page news? The student had a history of &quot;free pen testing&quot;, and they used this particular exploit to attempt malicious access and tampering of a teacher&#x27;s machine.<p>Imagine if you did the same at your workplace. &quot;Hey boss I have a habit of stealing coworker passwords.

Stop it.<p>--------------------------<p>Some rebuttals, or at least different perspectives on some of these points.<p>> 1. Using &#x27;guys&#x27; to mean people<p>The majority of girls/women in college do this. In fact, anecdotal, but I have seen this used much more often by women <i>outside</i> the tech field. I cannot count the number of times I have heard &quot;So where are you guys going out tonight&quot; amongst an all-female college group. So I don&#x27;t think men who use this term are being micro-aggressive, unless you count female usage of this term as a &quot;micro-aggression&quot; as well.<p>> 2. &quot;Girls&quot; for &quot;women&quot;<p>Similarly, unless older women are being micro-aggressive when they use this term, I don&#x27;t see why this is micro-aggressive. One of my biggest surprises was hearing my 50+ female co-worker telling me &quot;I&#x27;m a good girl, I pay all my bills on time.&quot;<p>> 3. &quot;Mom&quot; as an example of a non-technical user<p>I always use my dad as an example, even though my mom is the more non-technical person. But if &quot;mom&quot; is used way more often, maybe I can go along with this. Still, the suggestion therein to use &quot;cat, non-technical user, Ubuntu user&quot; is pretty silly in my opinion.<p>> 4. Using a default male avatar<p>How do you decide if an avatar is male? Jeans and T-shirts do not a male make in this day and age. I am not quite certain how you would distinguish between a non-gendered and gendered avatar.<p>> 5. Describing software or algorithms as “sexy”, “hot”, etc.<p>According to the author, this creates a &quot;college frat-boy environment&quot;. I would argue that outlawing normal adult words like &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; creates more of an infantilized classroom environment where you are essentially saying &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t say that bad word in front of the girls, or you&#x27;ll get punished.&quot; Using &quot;sexy&quot; to refer to a well-designed, sleek new website is, in my opinion, perfectly reasonable.<p>> 10. Using dark UI patterns.<p>This is a problem for all users. I don&#x27;t see why this should disproportionately drive women off.

Specifically in the areas of user engagement, growth, design, technology, and monetization. If this list is less than, say, three pages, then you&#x27;re probably not engaging with the idea at a deep enough level yet to be capable of successfully executing.<p>- Is this a good idea for you? In the above section I&#x27;m assuming there isn&#x27;t any significant founding team risk because you&#x27;re doing a startup that&#x27;s well-suited to your skillset; if not, it&#x27;s not a good idea for you. Remember, everyone is capable of running a successful business, even if it&#x27;s only a hotdog stand; the trick is finding an idea that&#x27;s just at the edge of your current skillset.<p>- What are the key metrics I need to hit for a seed round, series A, series B, etc? And similarly, what are the key assumptions, risks, and unknowns that I need to figure out before each of those rounds?<p>- What skills would I need to acquire to successfully run this business? E.g. if it&#x27;s a web startup you need to know how to code, if it&#x27;s a biotech startup then you need to know biotech, etc. In order for the business to be viable you need to have the skills to do the hard part yourself, for whatever that means for the given idea. You can hire more people to help you do the hard part faster, but you can&#x27;t hire them for something that you don&#x27;t already (mostly) know how to do yourself.",1428977046

Pumped storage power plants (a form of hydro where you use gravity as a gigantic battery) can also help smooth out any remaining fluctuation.<p>This could, however, change the balance of power between different regions of the world. Fossil fuels favor coastal flatlands where it&#x27;s easy to transport bulk materials. A civilization that depends on hydroelectricity, on the other hand, might favor a more mountainous terrain. The capitol in the postapocalyptic world of <i>The Hunger Games</i> is located somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, powered by hydro.<p>Our usual concept of business hours might also have to disappear, if we&#x27;re going to rely on hydro to smooth out fluctuations in other energy sources. We may no longer be able to afford peak usage at certain times of day, and therefore spread out power-consuming activites across all hours of the day and night. This helps eliminate the rush hour, which is itself a terrible waste of energy.<p>If push comes to shove and we need to ration power, I suppose this will put more pressure on battery technology. People will have to store up on power at certain times of the day, and use it until the next charge-up time. It will be a bit like fetching water from the well every morning.<p>But even under such circumstances, some people are clever enough to put a tank on the roof and install pipes/faucets to simulate a constant water supply. Batteries are to an intermittent power supply what a tank is to an intermittent water supply. We as a species can&#x27;t tolerate inconvenience. We&#x27;ll find a way to make life as convenient as possible, no matter what the circumstances. Intermittent meat supply? Brb, gonna store up on ham and bacon during the hunting season.",1428977040

So much theory around super-intelligences does very little to actually address the nature of intelligence or awareness, it merely treats intelligence like horsepower or computing cycles.

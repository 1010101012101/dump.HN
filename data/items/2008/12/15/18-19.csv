That combination caused crap-loads of ice to form on trees, wires, and even telephone poles (some poles fell over from the weight of the ice). There were seemingly healthy 18"" trees that just fell over from the weight of all the ice, blocking roads and pulling down power lines with them.<p>My parents live in NH, at the end of a dead-end dirt road and they're probably going to be without power until Wednesday. I spent most of the weekend trying to keep their generator working for them (my hands still smell of gas). All the Home Depot's in the area are price gouging, selling the generators as they come off the truck for $200 more than they're normally priced (and only allowing one per-customer). I even heard that people were driving truck-loads of generators up from further South and selling them off the back of their trucks.<p>(I attempted to write something creative about all this on my blog if you're bored at work: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5uyu6n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5uyu6n</a>)",1229367523

398621,comment,398354,398570,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"3. Before the designers grafted in objects, PHP was definitively not Java. It had one data structure, the array(). (I won't go so far as to call it a <i>simple</i> data structure, because its semantics are kind of nutty, but it's a lot simpler than the Java class system.) You can go very far in PHP without having to know what a class is.<p>Now that every schooled developer has been exposed to Java <i>ad nauseum</i> we're all blind to the fact that OO is not at all intuitive. You've got to keep a bunch of abstract hierarchies in your head simultaneously. (Classes can inherit from other classes; objects are instances of classes; objects can contain other objects.) You've got to learn a bunch of odd semantics. (Constructors look like functions but are called by the <i>new</i> operator. Destructors never get explicitly called at all. There's <i>static</i> members and <i>public</i> members and <i>private</i> members.) Then you've got to know how to use objects <i>properly</i> or you'll just make a mess; that involves learning a moderate amount of OO theory or reading one of those doorstopper-sized patterns books. As every DailyWTF reader knows, even a lot of ostensibly-trained professional developers do not actually understand this. It's a lot to ask of a person who just wants to learn how to rearrange the widgets on their Wordpress blog.<p>There are, of course, a few other languages that don't impose OO on people at time zero, so this is hardly a <i>unique</i> feature of PHP. But it is a feature. Or it <i>was</i>, anyway... PHP now has a tacked-on object system that is vaguely reminiscent of Java.",1229367398

I've been amazed at how many leaders in their fields are willing to give their time and input, especially if you respect their time.<p>Two quick stories:<p>1. Once emailed a prominent venture capitalist/technologist a question.  It was maybe 15 words long.  He responded in 5 minutes with a one word answer that truly answered my question and helped tremendously.<p>2. Another time I was taking a data mining class while working and I asked my professor a question.  It was regarding a situation at work and a solution that I proposed.  After not hearing back from my first email, I sent him a follow up email asking if he had received it.  He finally replied and said that if I wanted the answer, I would have to hire him at $250/hr, his going rate.  Sure, I can understand his stance in that just b/c I paying for his class and instruction does not mean that I can get free consulting.  But, why couldn’t he tell me that with a reply to the first email?  Why couldn’t he just tell me if my proposed solution was in the ball park or not?  Here’s the zinger, I wrote the same email to the author of the book we were using in this class.  He responds in 24 hours with sincere and honest feedback regarding my proposal as well as a PDF of 4 pages of the upcoming edition that covered this topic.  My respect for the author sky rocketed (and now I cannot recommend his services and books fast enough). Not so much for the professor.",1229366497

398580,comment,398488,398488,0,0,tptacek,,,"Couple things.<p>First, there isn't enough context in the LShift article to judge whether Marek has a valid point. He's conceded up front that both Libev and libevent show logN growth for adding new fd's to the loop, and seems to be arguing that it could be brought down to constant time. So? He hasn't presented evidence that the overhead he's talking about is significant in the real world. This is compute vs. I/O in an I/O-bound environment.<p>Next, he also seems to be taking his cues from the second set of benchmarks on the Libev page, in which every socket has a random timeout. This is a worst-case scenario for both Libev and libevent. Contrary to both the Libev page and Marek's analysis, setting timeouts on individual I/O events is not the only way to implement ""idle timeouts"" (which many protocols don't even have); it is in fact one of the poorer approaches.<p>Finally, he's taken two very specific benchmarks and generalized them to the whole design approach. Libevent is considered ""high-performance"" because async I/O is a high-performance design --- especially compared to demand-threading --- and libevent was the first stable, cross-platform implementation of it. It's also ""high-performance"" because it implements the high-performance kernel interfaces, like epoll. But the internals of libevent, while reasonable, are not (at least last time I checked) particularly optimized.<p>You can get around most of these problems by building on top of libevent; for instance, at Arbor Networks, we ditched libevent's (verbose, clumsy) timer interface for a better data structure, and simply kept libevent notified of the next closest timeout.<p>""Terrified"" seems like a very silly word to use here, but I'm always eager to get schooled.",1229365342

10489913,comment,10486541,10488959,0,0,cwyers,,,"Centralization is being driven by a lot of things, not least of which is that decentralization is really really hard. But a lot of it comes from mobile -- the idea behind decentralized apps before mobile came along was that bandwidth was not very dear -- oh, sure, it was limited in the days when IRC first became popular, but there was no reason to leave any of it unused. Local compute power was the same -- you may not have had a lot of it, but there was no reason to leave what you had sitting idle. Mobile is different. Idle CPU power can mean the CPU is throttled down to save on power and heat dissipation. Instead of staying connected to a server at all times, use &quot;push&quot; notifications so the server can let you know when it&#x27;s worth using battery power and metered data to talk to the server.<p>Decentralized systems, and peer-to-peer systems, and even centralized systems designed around computers designed to sit next to a wall outlet and draw power from a practically unlimited source are all being replaced by systems that are more centralized and better equipped to talk to mobile. AOL Instant Messenger is dying because it was built around an older paradigm and, at least last time I bothered to try it, is an incredible battery drain on Android devices. Newer messenger apps that are built mobile first or at least make mobile an equal partner to PCs are winning instead. And it&#x27;s the same for group chat -- IRC is built for old-fashioned PCs, Slack is built with mobile in mind.",1446436421

Well, let me tell you, people are not that stupid. Especially people with money.<p>Back in the dark ages, most people with money felt the best place to keep them was locked in a chest in the deepest room in a large castle. There was very little investment, and the dark ages were a time of extreme poverty. It is only through a long series of laws and institutions developed over couple of hundred of years, that we have reached this point of mobility of capital, which allows capital to go where it is most useful, and greatly benefits the economy.

I like to draw them and I seem to be pretty decent at them if the reactions I&#x27;ve been getting are any guide.<p>But I have to pay rent. And power, and internet. And pay for my subscription to Adobe&#x27;s Creative Suite, and upgrade my computer now and then.<p>If nobody&#x27;s paying me to draw my comics, I&#x27;m going to need to find a way to pay those bills anyway.

That much is true, but it&#x27;s also incomplete.<p>When looking at and eventually optimizing the whole system—from the customer and their needs, to the leadership of the company, to the clarity of purpose, to values and culture, to the intrinsic motivation of your employees, to methods of management, to your learning and education processes, to your processes of production, to your communication links, to your output and how it&#x27;s measured, and how each is controlled and understood in great detail—you can and will improve quality much more than you could by simply increasing cost in isolation—and at the same time, you&#x27;ll decrease your overall costs in the long term, you&#x27;ll speed up production, and you&#x27;ll increase sales and customer satisfaction. The end result is a better product, for lower cost, with more predictability, proud happy employees, and faster to boot. That&#x27;s what Quality really means.<p>Looking at quality in terms of cost alone is the naive mistake. Look at the whole system.<p>And for some evidence, look at Japan circa 1948. These exact methods of systemic quality, &quot;total quality control&quot; and statistical quality control taught to Japan by W. Edwards Deming turned them from the ruins of World War II into the second largest economy in the world, to the point of such success that Japanese companies were putting American ones to shame by the 70&#x27;s. They did this by following exactly the model I&#x27;ve described above, decreasing total costs, increasing quality, and improving time to market, all by focusing on their total systems across the organization. The proof is in the success of an entire country&#x27;s economy, I don&#x27;t know how it can get much clearer than that.<p>It is not my fault that everyone in our industry has forgotten these lessons on running companies, but the prevailing methods remain incorrect, as does your original statement.",1446435668

Since you need to know the correct hash ahead of time, Subresource Integrity works best when you&#x27;re requesting a well-known piece of static data from a 3rd-party server, e.g. jQuery version x.y from a CDN. For a site like Pagefair (or other sites that serve 3rd-party scripts, like Google Analytics), the benefit of the web platform is being able to serve _dynamic_ data. You get to upgrade your software quickly and easily, without the friction of obtaining the cooperation of your website partners (1st party sites that included Pagefair&#x27;s scripts) or end users.<p>If you want to use Subresource Integrity to prevent this kind of a problem, you need to first devise a mechanism to communicate the correct expected hash from the 3rd party site to their 1st party customers in a trusted manner. This is non-trivial. It adds a lot of friction to Pagefair&#x27;s software development and deployment processes (think about how you would implement A/B testing, for example). It&#x27;s also not a guarantee - if your servers can be hacked, it&#x27;s possible your &quot;trusted hash communication mechanism&quot; would be as well, unless you follow stringent security protocols (human confirmation for signing, offline keys, etc.) which would add even more friction.<p>Of course, you would need cooperation and involvement from your first-party customers for SRI to be effective in the first place, and I don&#x27;t know how many of them would be thrilled to have to devote engineering resources to fixing potential security problems caused by their partners... sounds like a good reason to consider switching to a competitor.",1446435594

Make it a formal process, it it may well have an effect.<p>1) Listen to all competing arguments. Make sure you are making a sound decision and your opposition is genuine and not based on a personal bias.<p>2) Make it explicit that you are are saying no in your role as a professional, and that this is not just a casual &quot;no&quot;.  Ethics require engineers to make decisions only in areas of competency, so make it clear that you are competent to make this decision, and your decision derives directly from your competency.<p>3) Write it down.  The document should cover 2) above, and set down the defensible reasons why assent is being refused, addressing counter arguments.  Consider that the arguments you write down could well be tested in court, and you will be cross examined on them.  The document/report should be of the same level as if you were a consultant to your employer.<p>4) Sign and submit the document (keeping a copy for yourself).  You need to be open about your opposition.  Keep it at a professional level.  Hopefully you will get some respect, as your document should make it clear that you have legitimate concerns and are not just being difficult.<p>5) Be prepared for the consequences.  Your opposition is now in writing and impossible to ignore.  No sane boss is going to ignore it, as the legal consequences of doing so are too great if you turn out to be right.  You will have heat applied to you, as the alternatives are to either address your concerns or to get you to retract, and the latter option is cheaper.<p>6) If the final decision is against you, either live with the decision or resign.

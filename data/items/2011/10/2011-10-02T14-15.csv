But even verifying that the stored procedure actually gets called is problematic.  In practice, one of the problems that actually occurred with the service is that the service host somehow lost permission to exec the stored procedure.  That's a server admin issue.<p>In my experience it feels like that case is pretty representative of most system defects, in that the majority of them seem to fall outside the space of defects that are feasible to test.

However, the benefit here with TDD is you still retain your testing ability.  More importantly, anywhere in the code also using the method can be easily discovered.  Finally, by doing this, you've automatically updated your documentation as well.<p>So, let's see, you've updated tests, code, and documentation all in one.

In designing a neutral age-screening mechanism, you might consider:<p>- Making sure the data entry point allows users to enter their age accurately. An example of a neutral age-screen would be a system that allows a user to freely enter month, day, and year of birth. A site that includes a drop-down menu that only permits users to enter birth years making them 13 or older, would not be considered a neutral age-screening mechanism since children cannot enter their correct age on that site.<p>- Not encouraging children to falsify their age information, for example, by stating that visitors under 13 cannot participate on your website or should ask their parents before participating. In addition, a site that does not ask for neutral date of birth information but rather simply includes a check box stating I am over 12 years old would not be considered a neutral age-screening mechanism.<p>- In addition, we recommend using a temporary or a permanent cookie to prevent children from back-buttoning to enter a different age.""",1317566664

Refactoring is a critical part of TDD, one which many people seem to forget.<p>> It's needless context switching when I have a general idea of how I want the code structured before I start writing anyway.<p>That's good.  You are allowed to have that.  In fact, your first test is implementing initial parts of that code.  What TDD is force you to document that in a formal manner.  It also highlights where things become cumbersome.  If it's hard to write a test, your code is probably far too complex for what it's trying to do.<p>Finally, knowing what you want is different then having what you need.  TDD gives the opportunity to focus on getting a finalized code base faster by not having to implement things that are unnecessary.<p>But really, when you describe TDD as write failing test, then write code to pass the test, and leave it at that, you've left out an essential pieces of the steps that is just as important as writing the test and writing the code.

66767,comment,66702,66753,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Just to add another data point -- I was interested in the games industry, and interviewed around a bit.  I turned away because it looked like overworked/underpaid was the norm.  Some people (like icculus) said that wasn't necessarily the case, but even they acknowledged it was the norm, and it's hard to be sure of what you're getting into when you're interviewing.<p>This agrees with the obvious economics at work: games are sexy, so programmers are in greater supply, so their value goes down.",1192178492

Good for April 1 and that's about it.",1192178326

I was thinking of using a glorified General Problem Solver to list our possible operations (elect this person, elect that person, do this, do that) in order to reach an end goal, the equilibrium. Maybe? Ideas?",1192177945

66762,comment,66702,66702,0,0,mxh,,,"Yes, I spent about 3.5yrs in it.  I can't really agree with the underpaid/overworked thing; the pay was fair, and the hours not unreasonable.<p>I left the industry because the idea of spending 2+ years on something that may-or-may-not pan out, with no way to tell before release, was beginning to get me down.<p>I realize startups are sort of the same thing, but I think they actually offer earlier feedback and greater opportunities for recovery than games.

66760,comment,66180,66238,0,0,tonit,,,"i am not sjure about 20+ hour spurts unless you include the most valuable time for coding: doing something away from any computer.. coding in you head. I think pg has written about it not too long ago. 
For me, this coding in your head continues and gets re-forumlated, stored as pseudocode in my head until i can write down the full the implementation in one step. 
This way i sometimes come to 48h+ of work (including dreaming of code;-) which is just 10percent pysical hacking at a keyboard.

I built myself a couple web apps with it years back, having never coded anything previously that wasn't on a TI-82. It's a good introductory language to web programming.<p>I'm now spending my time on RoR, and I don't think it's a very good language for starters. It's just too much to learn at once.",1198029595

(Our potential workaround until we have time to update aserve is to run huchentoot for the ssl login page only, as it is very noticably slower than aserve.  If anyone out there has aserve running with ssl on SBCL - please let me know.)",1198029355

You need to hope that you find patents for things that are similar enough to imply that your idea is also patentable but that no one has actually claimed what you are trying to claim.<p>This takes an extraordinary amount of time to do which is why lawyers charge so much money. But you can definitely do it yourself, if you want.",1198027400

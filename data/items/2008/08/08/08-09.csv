The memoirs of successful entrepreneurs are often interesting reads (e.g. ""Losing My Virginity"" by Richard Branson) but things like this are a paragraph of content extended to 200 pages with a $39.95 price tag.",1218185727

Everyone thought the discoverer of plate tectonics was wrong because he was unable to provide a precise mechanism for how the continents might move, despite an impressive array of fossil, biological, and other evidence. I don't think this theory of old masters and prodigies is completely debunked, but I thought Aaron's article brought up an excellent point about how the valuations were being made that I'd simply swallowed too easily. Aaron's submission was also the first thing I'd seen of anyone being critical at all, which was slightly startling in retrospect. I try to make a policy of not believing everything I hear and I failed this time.<p>I suppose I was a little condescending though. I'm sorry.",1218185178

I can't overcome the feeling that the other person tries to steal my money, and now I have to be careful and defend myself to reduce the damage. Then, I will end up with a stuff I don't really need.<p>Regarding the Turkey story, I just would not follow the man no matter what. I can't help, but persuasion doesn't work on me - the more other person tries to persuade me, the less likely I will buy anything.",1218183800

She figured out the process pretty quick: it's not quite that the people she encountered enjoyed haggling, it's just what they're used to. Haggling successfully to a low price gets you respect from the seller.<p>It is a completely foreign concept to Americans, who tend to come away with this feeling that either they've just been ripped off, or they just ripped off the seller.<p>I don't think I would handle it well at all (partly because I'm not fond of buying trinkets anyway).",1218183295

They basically mass-mail high school students trying to recruit some to sell knives.  A couple of my friends did it back in high school.  While it can be a way to improve your sales ability, this particular scheme (and many others) was little more than a fancy scam.<p>I fully agree with the title, but these ""independent reseller"" schemes seem to be hit-or-miss at best.  It might be a better experience to work in sales at a big company, rather than as an independent reseller.  John Doerr plays up the fact that he worked in sales at Intel before his VC life.  Or even better, sell something you made.",1218182699

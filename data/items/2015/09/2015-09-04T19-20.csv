You can channel people into the behaviors you want by making them easier; it&#x27;s not an all-or-nothing &quot;no matter what our environment is like, 3% of visitors will leave litter&quot; situation. There are many things you could do to reduce environmental damage while accommodating <i>more</i> visitors:<p>- You could put handrails around the trails. People aren&#x27;t supposed to leave them anyway.<p>- You could station trash cans along the trails. This makes it much easier to throw your trash in an appropriate place.<p>- You could establish fire pits in which it was officially OK to have fires.<p>- You could patrol the trails. This doesn&#x27;t work well when hikers are rare, but it scales beautifully as they get more common. Or, you could have a stationary security presence in problem areas.<p>- You could blaze new trails.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve listed except trail patrols is something I&#x27;ve personally seen in some areas. (Full disclosure, I&#x27;m actually just assuming that new trails get blazed from time to time. I have, however, personally experienced trails being radically reworked between visits.)<p>> [machismo is] far better than paved sidewalks and concrete staircases replacing trails<p>Why?",1441396790

That&#x27;s a compromise.  The UBI is less than poverty level, so that the conservatives can say that no one is getting a free ride, and people will still need to work to get by.  But it&#x27;s still around 90% of poverty line, so that the liberals can say that the government is still providing a great safety net.<p>There are 123M households in the US, for a population of 319M, so the total cost would be $200 * 123M + $75 * ( 319M - 123M ) per week, which is $39.3G, or $2.1 trillion per year.<p>The U.S. had official income of $3 trillion in 2014, so UBI would cost about 68% of the federal budget.",1441396379

Beyond medical/bio, Ann Arbor is way to small to support any large scale change in the overall state market.  While it does have it&#x27;s own small footing, it has little resource to expand outside of it&#x27;s own due to it&#x27;s location.  The location has corn fields to the north, west, and south.  To the east...between ann arbor and detroit you have...Canton, Plymouth, Van Buren, Romulus, Taylor...all of those are heavy manufacturing communities.<p>Which goes on to my prior point.  You have to change culture in order to do that.  The culture of the state is manufacturing with some bio/medical (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids).<p>Any innovation can really only come from 1 of 4 places... Detroit (metro), Ann Arbor, Lansing, and Grand Rapids.  Ann Arbor has a small scene, but doesn&#x27;t have the ability to grow without passing of that scene to a larger community.  Lansing is primarily government and manufacturing.  There is Michigan State University (50k+ students), but it&#x27;s a school with a primary focus on agriculture and not techonology.  This leaves Detroit and Grand Rapids.<p>In regard&#x27;s to Detroit, let&#x27;s think about it for a moment.<p>It is very much like taking the idea that you can easily change the culture and mindset of silicon valley from tech to manufacturing and industrial.  The people in silicon valley and the surrounding area do not have the skillset as a whole to provide that type of industry.  As well as through generations, the mindset of the people as a whole is not directed towards a manufacturing environment.  This is what is going on with Detroit.  You have had a VERY large portion of the economy (65%+) purely based on some type of auto manufacturing.  This is why Detroit city is at around 20% unemployment and the surrounding metro is around 8-10% unemployment.<p>Now..this leaves us with Grand Rapids.  Which actually is a viable candidate.  It has a younger generation overall, an international airport, a moderately sized city with room for expansion, and a vibrant downtown.<p>Then..we have to look further at the ability to grow a tech environment.  Is there the skill&#x27;s needed?  Are there investors available to fund companies in this area?  Are there incentives to stay in the area?<p>In reality, all of those answers are relatively &quot;No&quot;.<p>You can get better talent in a warmer climate with the same exact (if not better) opportunities (funding, viability, community backing, tax incentives..etc) in other cities with a better climate (yes, climate is really a big deal)...such as Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle.<p>Unless Michigan does something drastic like being a startup tax-haven, having major incubators, or the like; it will never happen.  Too many other places offer the same or much better, but in a more comfortable climate.<p>(In case anyone think&#x27;s climate isn&#x27;t a big deal, try moving to Alaska or Montana.

The only thing that prevents cities from burning when we must inevitably cut SS benefits is that the affected will be too elderly to go out there and burn things. But it&#x27;s still less of a problem, because the separation of concerns makes it hard for systematic calls to raise benefits to really get going, except maybe SS. Unifying them into one easy phrase changes that.)<p>I want to see this work at a smaller scale before I would even <i>remotely</i> support recklessly experimenting with the largest economy in the world with such a fundamental change.

You need to make implementation choices that will make some people very unhappy though.<p>First, you start with non-institutionalized adult citizens that brings you down to a payee base of ~210M (this part will be unpopular as parents will want to get more than other adults). Next you set the basic income at the poverty level for a single person, $11,700. That gives you a total nominal cost of $2.47T. You do not exempt the basic income from the normal taxation rules. That means you get some of it back in taxes. If you figure 20% that gives you a net cost of $1.97T. You then take a buzz saw to all social spending aimed at US citizens, including all parts of social security (this would be very unpopular among the elderly, near elderly and disabled). With all parts of social security adding to more than $800B/year It&#x27;s fairly easy to find a $1T in savings there. That brings the total to under a trillion dollars. You take a buzz saw to tax expenditures, e.g. exclusion of fringe benefits, preferential rates for capital gains and dividends, mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deduction, etc. (this is also going to be very unpopular). If you add it up, that&#x27;s good for another $550B.<p>That leaves you with another $420B in new non-offset spending.

And for the few people actually starving or freezing to death because of lack of funds in the USA, yes, that&#x27;s genuinely a new cost we&#x27;d have to bear, but that&#x27;s a rarity and I don&#x27;t feel too bad about new taxes if it&#x27;s genuinely saving lives.<p>There are second order incentive effects in both directions that are certainly worthy of consideration, but a naive consideration of the facts on the ground suggests it&#x27;s not at all impossible or even requiring any real magic, given the political will.",1441394524

> still need to constantly raise money...<p>Disclaimer: I work at Backblaze.  The biggest difference I see is the expectations and control of investors.  Most of our Backblaze team was involved with a startup called MailFrontier which raised $22.5 million over four years selling almost 90 percent of the company to the VCs.  The VCs removed the founder CEO (my partner), installed a puppet CEO that did whatever they asked, and the VCs eventually forced us to sell in a way that basically returned them their original investment.<p>So Backblaze was a visceral reaction to that experience of losing that control.  It&#x27;s the same team, but we all agreed to go a year without salary to jump start it without selling control.  To this day, the only people who sit and vote on the board of directors are Backblaze employees and founders.<p>The lack of cash meant slower growth, there is no doubt about it.  But it is a profoundly different company, and a profoundly different experience.  We make decisions that are good for our business and good for our employees, not to massage the egos of a bunch of spoiled VCs.  And along the way, the Backblaze founders and employees own the vast majority of the company. Most importantly, nobody can force us to sell.  I like my job and I like my coworkers, and I make a fine salary here.  Why does everything have to be about the winning top score no matter how unpleasant and then ending the experience?

You pay $X, and they mail you a new wad of glossy paper every month.  If you don&#x27;t pay $X, you just don&#x27;t get new magazines.  You can still read all the old ones.  Remember National Geographic?  Remember how your grandfather kept huge stacks of them that were all only an awkward elbow away of toppling onto the floor?  Presuming you could locate it in the stacks, you could re-read the article about Elbonian mud-rakers as often as you pleased.<p>If you subscribed to JetBrains&#x27;s magazine, you pay $X, and every month they give you a new magazine, and take back the previous month&#x27;s issue.  If you stop paying, they would come to your house, confiscate your latest issue, and then search the premises to make sure you weren&#x27;t keeping any older issues, or any photographs or copies of them.  If you want to read something, it&#x27;ll just have to be something else, like RMS&#x27;s free gnewsletter.<p>What JetBrains is doing is <i>not</i> switching to a subscription model.  They are switching to a DRM-enforced <i>rental</i> model.<p>Subscriptions are ideal from products that are consumable or otherwise ephemeral.  Television shows or newspapers or foods or coupons or pharmaceutical drugs work for that.  Things that are used once and discarded are perfect for subscriptions.<p>Rental is good for things that have a low marginal benefit in comparison to their upfront costs, such that it takes a long time to recover that initial investment.  You rent a hotel room for a night or two.  You rent a car when you fly to another city.  You rent a pneumatic excavator when you only have one hole to dig.  You rent things that you do not intend to use enough to justify paying their purchase price.<p>With respect to a tool of the trade--something you buy to help you make more money--you emphatically want to own that, rather than just rent it.  That&#x27;s a great argument for using open-source IDEs.  Even the previous model was just a perpetual license with a limited-time upgrade option.

In any of those situations, you&#x27;ll be left scrambling to find a replacement for something that once was a critical part of your business.",1441393266

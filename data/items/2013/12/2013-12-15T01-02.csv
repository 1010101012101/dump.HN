If you can see your helmet at all then that&#x27;s part of your peripheral vision you are sacrificing. And if you can&#x27;t see your helmet it&#x27;s probably not gonna do much in a car crash anyway... I prefer not to get hit and one way to do it is ride in a part of the world that respects people on bikes. When I lived in Mountain View I wore a helmet... but I also didn&#x27;t bike much.",1387072758

Homakov could donate his time, as a skilled and highly-trained professional consultant, to a $32bn publicly-traded company<p>This is probably the best option, but only if you approach it the same way most contractors do when offering a discount/free service for a client.<p>When you do free work, <i>don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s free</i> -- instead, say that you&#x27;re offering a 100% discount. Sent your client an invoice for the price you&#x27;d regularly charge for such a thing, with the entire price deducted off at the bottom. Include a note saying that this is an offering of goodwill, and that you hope this will help in building a relationship with them in the future.<p>Leave the client to decide for themselves whether this means that your future vulnerability reports will come <i>without</i> this discount, and see what they say in response.",1387072723

6907969,comment,6906989,6907752,10,0,drewcrawford,,,"Well I think we are blurring two different issues here.  The first question is whether or not full disclosure is acceptable.   The second question is whether or not it is acceptable to choose it because one is not being paid.<p>As far as full disclosure being acceptable, there are a lot of advocates.  For example Bruce Schneier, Leonard Rose, and others.  Not to mention that this issue isn&#x27;t in a high impact category like remote code execution, loss of data, privacy, etc.  It&#x27;s also difficult to exploit; it requires authorizing a malicious app.  So for all those reasons separately, and certainly all of them together, I think full disclosure is a completely acceptable choice.<p>Given that it is acceptable, is it still acceptable to do it if it furthers our own interests?  Again, I think the answer is yes.  The fact it is in my interest does not make an acceptable action into an unacceptable one.<p>You seem to be hung up on the fact that the researcher here was not particularly nice to Twitter.  But people are under no obligation to be nice.  It would be nice if you sent me a check for $200.  But you won&#x27;t, because there&#x27;s no obligation to do that.

Of course once customers notice, they can switch, _if_ there is sufficient competition. But companies love merging, and at some point, a powerful protection agency can dictate terms to smaller agencies. The largest agencies can form a cartel to concentrate and divide even more power. And sure, you can switch to a small, independent agency, but will they be able to protect you against the big guys? Maybe if enough people switch, but that takes time.<p>In the end, you&#x27;re trying to play one protection racket against another protection racket, but in the end, you&#x27;re still stuck with a protection racket.<p>Let&#x27;s first try to get honest competition working in something fairly innocuous like telecommunication, before we start giving those companies real power, okay?",1387071821

It implies an enormous amount of extra data motion which is arguably <i>the</i> major killer of performance in parallel databases; it is the same reason Hadoop is so slow and inefficient for analytic queries. Additionally, secondary indexing structures and similar types of de-normalization offer poor performance in distributed environments due to the implied consistency and coordination problems; it will severely degrade insert/update/delete operation performance as the data structures grow. Most database applications also value a high-degree of predictability of performance under load, which this definitely will not allow.

However, this system was automatically deactivated (which is an <i>extremely</i> rare occurence) when the pitot/airspeed tubes were covered with ice and the computer hence couldn&#x27;t make correctly informed decisions about the aircraft.<p>In that case, however, you could point to a big UX problem: It was not announced in big, red letters that the fly-by-wire system had in fact been deactivated.

And one that is not powerful enough to stand up to the more powerful gangs or corporations. You will still need a larger structure of organization to defend against the larger threats.<p>> The government-run police primarily serve the interests of the rich and powerful and their own interests - they don&#x27;t do much to protect the poor.<p>That&#x27;s certainly the case in corrupt countries, but much less so in the less corrupt ones.<p>> I&#x27;m talking about actual rule of law, which does protect the rich and poor alike.<p>What law? Whose law? Who enforces that law if you don&#x27;t have a government? Without enforcement, the law is meaningless. With enforcement, you&#x27;ve got a government. There&#x27;s really nothing in between there.<p>What you&#x27;re talking about are different forms of government. Better ones, perhaps. There are definitely a lot of improvements possible (and needed) in our current forms of government, and especially so in the US. But one way or the other, you&#x27;ll still end up with some form of government.<p>> Consider that by social convention when you aggress against me I have a claim against you for damages. Suppose I can sell that claim. If I can afford to prosecute you directly I do so; if not, I sell my claim against you to someone who is more powerful. But selling a claim is an ordinary business transaction - it doesn&#x27;t give the buyer any special power over the seller.<p>Sounds interesting, but to prosecute, you still need courts, you still need enforcement, and that means you still need government.

1098942,comment,1097723,1098092,0,0,dkarl,,,"As a ""battle"" I think it is stupid.  Otherwise, I disagree with you.  They're very different languages.  Python is great for people who are accidental programmers or non-programmer programmers, especially ones who think mathematically and analytically.  It's popular among scientists and engineers who need to understand a language pretty completely in a top-down way, but who want to waste as few brain cells as possible on a programming language because their brainpower is primarily applied to other things.<p>Personally, I've always programmed primarily in other languages (C++ being mein liebster Feind) but I've relied a lot on Python (and occasionally Jython) for day-to-day scripting and for delivering code to customers that reorchestrates existing code to do new things.  Python has never lit a single creative spark in me, but it has always delivered for me without demanding much in return.  Now, that is a statement you will <i>never</i> hear applied to Ruby.<p>I don't know much about Ruby, but the things I hear about it remind me of Perl in some ways.  Back in the day, I spent a lot of time learning Perl, promptly forgetting it, and going back to Perlmonks to learn it yet again.  Perl comes naturally for impressionists who love to program by instinct, pattern-matching, and trial-and-error.  They love it when something new pops into their head and they type it in and it just works, and they aren't immediately sure how or why.  Perl is also for dedicated professionals who want a tool that rewards more study and practice with more and more power -- mastery of Perl is a never-ending road with a seemingly never-ending escalation of power and awesomeness.<p>Ruby seems to be a much more easily understood language than Perl, but (from the outside) it seems to share Perl's magical flavor and open-ended approach to mastery.  Python is better for people like me who want working, understandable code for the smallest lifetime intellectual investment.",1265233053

That is probably the majority of readers of HN and their kids.<p>What this study is talking about is social rejection among kids who are not that intelligent or self-driven. In school, you may remember one person who, though not ""geeky,"" did seem slightly off. Kids jump on this quickly, lacking any absolute ideas about behavior and only knowing what they are used to.<p>For geeks, this rejection can become a strong drive and badge of honor among ourselves. But for ""normal"" kids who just happen to be out of sync with their peers, and have nothing else to define themselves in terms of, it is a big problem.",1265231109

I'm explaining a flaw in the guy's logic.<p>I completely agree with you in that companies should be able to broadcast whatever message they want. After all it's the responsibility of the citizens to determine what's right.<p>But I think you're missing the point of my contention. I'm simply saying companies cannot be treated as a citizen in a government designed to serve the <i>people</i>. I'm saying companies are entities, and they are not a human being. They do not need to be fed food, or sleep, or care about people's suffering (unless it would be fiscally wise to do so).",1265230841

It doesn't matter whether it's accurate or not, whether it's about an attribute or something else: a statement is an insult if it's perceived as such.<p><i>What you call ""stupidity"" is often just a lack of curiousity - such people are the workers of society, the ones who don't get bored.</i><p>I think that lack of curiosity has less to do with intelligence than with upbringing. However, it's just my personal opinion and I would be interested in finding out whether there are any theories or studies about that.",1265230808

9562373,comment,9560158,9561148,0,0,Manishearth,,,"As mentioned below, we have two types of refcounted ptrs; one for threads and one for not-threads.<p>In conjunction with RefCell and Cell and Mutex we get some really useful abstractions that are still safe (runtime safe).<p>I plan to write another blog post listing what they do exactly (and how they come together to provide neat abstractions), but:<p>- Box<T> is a boring old owned pointer. It can hand out references that can not live longer than it (checked statically) and it is destroyed when it goes out of scope.<p>- asterisk-const T and asterisk-mut-T (sorry, I don&#x27;t know how to use asterisks on HN without it breaking formatting) are your C pointers. Unsafe to dereference, and don&#x27;t have the lifetime checks associated with them. Good for FFI and building abstractions.<p>- &T and &mut T are your borrow checked references. These are like regular pointers except they can&#x27;t statically outlive the thing they borrow from; and follow the rwlock pattern mentioned in the blog post<p>- Rc is a refcounted shareable pointer. Its main job is ensuring that destructors are run correctly.<p>- Arc is a version of Rc that uses atomics and is thread safe (but slower)<p>- RefCell/Cell are ways of (at runtime) ensuring that the rwlock pattern is followed. Cell doesn&#x27;t use locks or refcounts, but RefCell does. RefCell will keep a track of how many read-references have been taken from it, and make sure that there are none when someone tries to write to it.<p>- Mutex is kinda-sorta the multithreaded version or RefCell[^]. It&#x27;s a simple lock, not an RWLock (though there&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t use that either), and it gives you thread safe access to mutable data.<p>- Rc<RefCell<T>> is a common pattern when you want a cycle-free GC-like construct that&#x27;s going to be bounced around and mutated all over the place. Think Java in a single thread. (Ignoring cycles for now)<p>- Arc<Mutex<T>> is the thread safe version of the above. Think Java with the appropriate synchronized/volatile keywords everywhere, or Go with mutexes.<p>All of these use RAII and type safety (especially a thing called &quot;kinds&quot; which makes sure single-threaded abstractions don&#x27;t get shared across threads, but allows them to be sent across threads depending on the situation) to provide thread safety and memory safety. In many cases the safety requires more and more dynamic checks, for example with Arc<Mutex<T>> it&#x27;s basically <i>all</i> dynamic checks. Which also means that you&#x27;re free to throw it around however you want and the compiler won&#x27;t complain, though of course beware the deadlocks, and if the dynamic checks cause an assertion failure you&#x27;re going to have to debug it.<p>Except the first three, these could be written in a separate library. The first one could, too, for the basic features, though there is some additional compiler support that gives it special behavior and makes it easy to work with. We hope to remove that though.<p>The fact that there&#x27;s such a variety of things that provide various guarantees can be intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s quite powerful. You can then only pay what you need to pay -- for example if you want refcounting but don&#x27;t need to worry about threads; you don&#x27;t pay the cost of the threads. If you want to use shared data with scoped threads, you can even use a plain Mutex with no refcounting. If you want to use the rwlock pattern locally, don&#x27;t use a thread-safe RWLock, just use RefCell/Cell. Et cetera et cetera.<p>---------------------<p>I&#x27;m also working on a GC here[1]. Completely untested, the two of us just implemented a design that we hammered out on Saturday and haven&#x27;t really looked at yet. We&#x27;re convinced it&#x27;s broken :P but I&#x27;m sure we can fix it. The design is mark-and-sweep, though we&#x27;re trying to avoid stack scanning and rely on tracing/rooting only (Rust has some neat advanced features that makes this possible to consider). Single threaded only for now.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://github.com/manishearth/rust-gc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/manishearth/rust-gc</a><p>[^]: Since I&#x27;m already calling RefCell a single threaded RWLock, perhaps this cyclic definition isn&#x27;t perfect. :P Anyway, a Mutex is a mutual exclusion thing which you&#x27;ve probably used that ensures that only one thread can access the inner data at a time.",1431909745

Theres nothing fundamentally special about the mechanism used to do so. If cars can do it, great! If they can&#x27;t but trains and trolleys can, good!<p>I maintain that a pre-requisite to &quot;good&quot; public transportation is bad infrastructure for cars. If you had good car infrastructure, and many medium sized cities do, the public transportion wouldn&#x27;t be needed.<p>Good transportation for large, dense cities is an unsolved problem.

All of the 2C&#x27;s, NBOMe&#x27;s, and of course LSD are typically sold under the name &quot;acid&quot;. And when people are dosing what they assume is LSD, they might accidentally ingest 10–100 times the regular dose of another psychedelic, sold to them as &quot;acid&quot;. While it doesn&#x27;t lead to many deaths each year, safe drugs still kill people because they are unregulated and illegal.<p>&quot;On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations.

Europe is full of examples of detailed urban planning dating back a millennium or more.<p>Roman cities were carefully planned out to ensure transport, water supply, defence capabilities etc.<p>After the Roman expansion, we have tons of plan-drawings for new city developments across Europe spanning hundreds of years.<p>The US too had any number of prominent examples of detailed city planning dating back to e.g. Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan for Washington D.C. in 1791.<p>It might be more reasonable to say that in the US, city planners were still not considered relevant to planning major transport infrastructure. City planners were employed to handle the layout of the interior of cities, and more often landmarks and politically important parts of the downtown areas. Why would you consult them when you wanted to figure out how to move people <i>between</i> cities? It was not seen as their domain.<p>Europe was different in this respect mostly because Europe already had the road networks, and population density along them, that means building freeways have been largely about upgrading/replacing existing &quot;working&quot; road connections that were already integrated into the urban fabric, sometimes through centuries, or even dating back to Roman times, and much less about creating entirely new road connections.<p>Add on to this difference that freeways were seen as a sign of the future even in Europe to the point where e.g. the London suburb where I live was <i>proud</i> to get a flyover cutting straight through the historic city centre in the 50&#x27;s - it passes right by a market dating back to the 1300&#x27;s, and a church dating back to some time before 960...

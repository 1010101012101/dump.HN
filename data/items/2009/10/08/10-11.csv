Tech Stops have disappeared, they run out of bikes for interns, don't even get me started on how crowded the gyms have become, it's definitely worse than before. Perhaps I'm bitter because I got no annual bonus as an intern :)",1254999533
868737,comment,868132,868555,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"The thing that people get wrong about the idea of ""less is more"" is that they choose the wrong features to eliminate. They don't have a strategy, except that they will do and be less. (And it's often the HARD things to design and build that they leave out.)<p>They focus so hard on elimination, that they don't add back things that the other apps do not have.<p>AND they think that they will still have universal appeal. They don't consciously say ""OK, we are going to remove these features, because we don't want to serve this type of customer... which will make us more appealing to another type of customer.""<p>They just think that less === more, and that's it.<p>Just like any dogma, people cargo-cult it. They use it as a mantra without understanding <i>why</i>.<p>FWIW, my app was one of the ones featured -- Freckle Time Tracking (<a href=""http://letsfreckle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letsfreckle.com/</a>). They wrote:<p>""Freckle just makes you want to keep track of your time. The conveniently condensed interface shines with energetic color, turning a routine task into something fun.""<p>And that, in a nutshell, is much of what we tried to achieve with Freckle. Our key feature? Take away the pain. Take away the guilt. Make it effortless, and dare I say it, fun.<p>We don't have everything, by choice.<p>Do we have fewer features than Harvest? Damn straight.<p>We don't do time sheet approval. We don't do pre-approved tasks. We don't do any kind of extreme permissions control.. anyone in the account can create new projects, for example.<p>Our software is built for small teams with a flatish hierarchy, not for traditional iron-fist-control businesses.<p>That is LESS with a purpose.<p>For our customers, that's not a ""lack of features"" -- it's a downright BONUS. Because they have a small team, or are by themselves, and so having to set up tasks in advance (like in other software) actually reduces their ability to work effectively.<p>On top of all those removals, we've added back things that nobody else does. Time entry on every page. The Pulse, which helps you identify your work patterns. Saveable reports.<p>Even most of the people who <i>cancel</i> their accounts write us that they love the app and they're sorry they have to cancel.<p>So I certainly feel we're doing something right. We don't want to be Microsoft Word. Our goal isn't just to make gobs of money, or even dominate the niche. We want to build software that fits our philosophy and <i>makes people happy</i>.<p>We have a smaller audience, yes, but it's an audience who agrees with our principles.",1254999462

868731,comment,867491,867539,0,0,nikolayv,,,"In the end, it was inevitable. It was part of my reason to turn down their full-time offer and accept another company's. Last summer when I was an intern at Google, free cookies at 3pm were discontinued. By the time I got back in June 2009, we didn't even have a Tech Stop in my building anymore. No dance party, etc. Still, to me at least, this is not yet the time when Google became just another company. The stuff you learn there, the technology at your fingertips, and the capable co-workers are still amazing.<p>But it's headed that way. In the next 5-10 years, I predict the following will happen to Google. Most of it is quite obvious:\na. a major PR disaster, such as significant cloud data loss, or poor availability numbers for a day or week, something like that\nb. stock will not have the same phenomenal growth\nc. loss of search market share (of which a big deal will be made, but really, soon it will have nowhere to go, but down)<p>For me the deciding factors in choosing another offer were: \na. bigger company size => little chance to ""change the world"" like Eric Schmidt still likes to say\nb. much better stock packages from my other options (Facebook's was essentially 4 times Google's at the latest valuation, and I do understand that's because of the higher risk, but for a college grad, that should be a no-brainer).\nc. bonus perk I believe Google never had: 21 business days of vacation.",1254999033

Except that everything Nielsen writes/promotes is couched in such a way that it looks black & white, and so naturally people take it to extremes. Because he encouraged them to, in the way that he presents his information.<p>Consider the surrounding circumstances to the ""pure"" information he posts:<p>1. He says it is SCIENCE!<p>2. He does not allow for differing levels of user engagement. (If you're interested, you will not behave the same way as somebody who has no interest.)<p>3. He does not reveal the type of user / type of content being tested. (Are they bored to tears? Is it well-written, captivating content? Is it something relevant to their life?) Would this be hard? Yes. But you <i>cannot</i> evaluate the ""facts"" without it!<p>4. He may waffle a little now and again, and say something that's not entirely ""my way or the highway"" strident -- e.g. ""Is all key information visible above the fold?"" -- but...<p>5. He NEVER lists proven counter-examples.<p>Examples for #5: many ""sales letters"" of products on the internet (esp. info products) rely on heavily engaging the user's interest FIRST, and then following a build-up-let-down pattern of excitement. Often their critical info -- price, call to action buttons -- are well below ""the fold."" Waay, way down there... they only reveal it to people who are biting the hook.<p>And this works. Really, really well. It works because it engages the visitor, and builds suspense, rather than just laying it all in front of them.<p>But has Nielsen ever addressed this?<p>Ha!<p>He uses the attachment that people have to ""science,"" ""statistics,"" and ""facts,"" and exploits it to provide certainty in an an uncertain world.<p>Too bad it's false certainty.",1254998097

The problem is that you only want someone with significant experience, not just someone who is ""unafraid"" of it, because any worthy developer unversed in those projects would be scared to just jump in and start changing random things if the work is ever going to be used.<p>Both Linux and MySQL are huge, complex systems and if you want someone who can immediately start making usable changes to those systems, you should probably recruit on their respective mailing lists.

His legacy has been tarnished a bit my the hyper-consumerism that the Disney company is famous for. That said he:<p>1. Invented the feature length animated movie. A multi-billion dollar business that paved the way for Pixar, Aardman, and all the other great creators we admire in that industry.<p>2. Invented the modern theme park. The ""Second Life"" of 1955! This is another massive multi-billion dollar business. It is also impressive in its technical scope employing physicists, pyrotechnic folks, and a bunch of roboticists who work on the audio-animatronic robots.<p>3. The Disney ""Imagineering"" crew is probably one of the most interesting interdisciplinary groups around combining nearly every kind of engineer with every kind of artist to create amazing things on an ongoing basis.<p>4.

4028634,comment,4027938,4027938,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"Ah, there is a huge opportunity for a product here. Someone could make a lot of money on taking families into account (no pun intended) when providing ""cloud"" services. Let me explain through some examples:<p>My wife and I currently have Android phones. We have several choices for where we can buy music, apps, books and other content. Almost none of them allow us to share our purchases. Apps simply cannot be shared (please correct me if I am wrong on this point). Music can be shared but the process involves (1) purchasing a song on one of the available music stores, (2) connecting the phone to a computer, (3) downloading the song from the phone to the computer (incidentally, the only universal means of creating a backup), (4) connecting the other device to the computer (5) uploading the song.<p>Google Music does make things slightly easier. For one, there is less reason for backups. However, music purchased on one phone still has to end up on another person's phone via a computer. The situation is worsened by the fact that on Android your Google account is very deeply integrated into your phone experience. The only sensible solution I can think of is for us to create a separate account through which we purchase music, movies, apps, etc.<p>The situation is a bit better with Apple ID. At least here, as TFA points out, you can have a setup that allows you to not spend 2x or more on the same content, but also have individual accounts. However, the length of the article alone suggests that there is a problem.<p>The perfect solution would look something like this: a cloud-based drive with several areas: 1 GB of encrypted storage for private data, 20 GB for music and book storage, streaming capabilities for all videos. Anything in these areas should be sharable with a small set of people I choose to share it with. For example, when I buy a song or an app, it should automatically show up on my wife's phone. Bonus points for some kind of a parental control system (no rock n roll for my kids once I have them). Any photo I take should automatically be uploaded to the encrypted area but also optionally shared with my family. All the app data should automatically be backed up as well, so that I can continue using the app on my laptop from where I left off on my phone.<p>Note, that it is very important to also not share some things by default. For example, if I want to keep a copy of my private GPG key in the encrypted area, I do not want to share it with my wife. Another example would be a document with account numbers from my job: not something my family needs to see.<p>Obviously this is a tall order. Encryption means no capability to do de-duplication. Sharing apps is also a bit funky, especially I buy them from a third-party app store. However, this system would much more closely address the real-world patterns of how families use smartphones, computers and cloud storage. Whoever figures this out first will likely make a lot of money.",1338072793

Next argument?<p>><i>And ""cough a bit more"" is probably the understatement of a day. Those fuckers even create more radioactive waste (which won't get collected) when they work as intended, than nuclear plants when they break down.</i><p>Not so. The article you link to says the researchers found comparable or slightly higher levels to that of a nuclear factory in <i>normal</i> operation. And it goes on to say:<p><i>McBride and his co-authors estimated that individuals living near coal-fired installations are exposed to a maximum of 1.9 millirems of fly ash radiation yearly. To put these numbers in perspective, the average person encounters 360 millirems of annual ""background radiation"" from natural and man-made sources, including substances in Earth's crust, cosmic rays, residue from nuclear tests and smoke detectors.</i><p>Quite quaint. Not at all what happens in a nuclear plant accident.<p>A lot of geek people like to support nuclear plants because they think it's the pro-science thing to do (""oh, those ignorant masses, they are afraid of science""), and will twist the facts as fast as any bible-yielding evolution-denier to do so.<p>Well, nuclear plants are not science: they are technology, that is applied science.<p>Unlike, say, math, technology is not perfect: it's shaped by private interests, it's prone to human error (from the design to the development, to the operation stage), and it can also do a lot of bad shit, from blowing up people a la Challenger to Chernobyl.",1338072407

4028593,comment,4027312,4027312,1,0,warmfuzzykitten,,,"It would be more interesting to read why Peter Theil is All Wrong. He had absolutely no data to back his assertion that, except for computing, technological progress has stalled. He referred to data in his National Review piece, ""The End of the Future"", but, gosh, he didn't have any and didn't have any idea how to get it. So he decided to use economic growth as a surrogate for technological progress, based on the theory that progress implies growth.<p>There is no proof that progress in technology inevitably results in economic growth. That's a belief system arising from the post-war glory years that were the last half of the 20th century, when advertising campaigns by the likes of GE and Dow Chemical tried to convince us that our well-being was due to their efforts. ""Better living through chemistry."" ""Progress is our most important product.""<p>It might as easily be that economic growth results in technological progress. The more profitable companies are more they have to spend on research that isn't aimed at next year's bottom line. It might even be that both growth and progress are caused by wars, and the problem is we haven't had a big one lately.<p>In order to buy Theil's inverted implication, we first have to buy the premise. Progress implies growth. Where's the evidence for that? What we saw was a correlation, not a causal relationship.<p>Even if it were true, progress in one place, say China, doesn't necessarily mean growth in another, say the US. There is a reason why virtually all consumer electronic products are made in China, and it isn't cheap labor, but superior technology. It's not that we don't want to make the stuff here.

Obviously not a smart move, and he did pay a price for it.  The whole topic got brought up because I was planning on interviewing in one of their Rails shops and by doing research on the company I had stumbled across stories of people that had this exact thing happen to him, so I was shocked when he explained that it had happened to him as well.<p>I don't think the ""fee"" is unreasonable if a few hundred dollars is the going rate for licensing the image (although I personally would never pay that much), I just find the automated process of hunting these people down and asking for money right away (no option to just take it down immediately) a little distasteful, and in a similar vein to the RIAA's tactics.",1338069700

Everyone has ideas.  Some are great, some suck.  The idea by itself is really meaningless until someone does something with it.  Ideas, to me, are like knowledge.  They should never be locked up, and should be freely shared.",1338069676

How many failures have occurred for other reasons? From that standpoint it is hard to argue that the premiums would have been significantly different without that clause. I'd also point out that such a clause is hardly unusual in the insurance business. You'll see the like on all kinds of property and liability policies.<p>To prove your assertions, you'd need to come up with a nuclear reactor which was constructed in an unregulated environment. ;-)<p>Look, I'm not making claims one way or another. I'm simply suggesting that your claim doesn't seem very credible once one has applied some very simple logic. I could be missing something, but I think you ought to have some evidence to back up such an extraordinary claim. As someone else pointed out, your typical coal operation ought to have a higher incident rate and cost, which means it ought to be even more expensive...<p>Realistically, you can calculate the costs without coming up with your silly example. It is sufficient to simply add up the costs needed to cover the disaster, and then look at the premiums paid for covering similar sized disasters with similar rates of occurrence, making your best effort to extrapolate over any gaps.<p>Alternatively, speak with an actuarial who works in the business and they can extrapolate what the premiums would be. In a truly unregulated market, I'd imagine the incident rate would be higher and the recovery costs a bit lower, so it might be hard to get a real cost, but go for the costs in the existing regulated market. I have a hard time imagining they'd be prohibitive, but I'd be intrigued if you proved otherwise.",1338069638

Based on some of the comments is this thread it seems to me their business model is like ""Enterprise Sales"", some guy landing on their page getting a good price is not how their model works. That sucks, because I wouldn't mind paying 5-10x over iStockphoto for a great picture, but 50-100x is too much.",1338069626

Where there any particular points made you disagree with?<p>Do you live in a dense city with a large number of cyclists?  I think there&#x27;s merit to the argument that automobile drivers are <i>already</i> predicting that cyclists will run through intersections, so this clarification would be a significant improvement.<p>The system is composed of individual interactions, and the rules they suggest (and which research seems to indicate reduce collisions) seem sensible in the context of those individual interactions.  What specifically do you disagree with?",1400198377

7753015,comment,7746750,7752355,1,0,jules,,,"> Yes, it is always “possible” to make a NaN to compare to. Which is more convenient for programmers: x != x or x == someObscureMeansOfGettingNAN( )? Which is more portable and verifiable? I can’t believe you’re actually arguing for the latter.<p>Tell me, which is clearer: x != x, or x == NaN. Obviously, the latter is much clearer. We don&#x27;t live in the 1960&#x27;s any more, we have libraries now. No need for getting NaN to be obscure.<p>> Just fine; 0./0. is what this example needs to avoid, tiny/tiny is perfectly OK. That’s the whole point. You don’t want |x| < eps, you really do want x == 0. This happens all the time; if you’re not aware of such uses and you feel strongly about these issues, you may want to spend some more time studying the way these tools are used in low-level numerics.<p>Please, do give a <i>concrete</i> example, if they are so abundant. Otherwise you will keep saying &quot;yea, but for <i>some</i> examples, that&#x27;s not an issue&quot;. Anyway, this is wholly besides the point. You still refused to answer the question I actually asked: NaN not 0.<p>> (That said, if NaN < x is an error, that will really cause issues when someone tries to use it as a key in an ordered container).<p>As it should. The current behavior may cause silent errors and corruption, instead of blowing up and notifying you. Which would you prefer?",1400198243

7753000,comment,7752547,7752782,4,0,simonlebo,,,"I live in Australia and the debate here is pretty heated between cars and cyclists. The main reason pedestrians are not really mentioned is, in my opinion, because Australia does not have many pedestrians centres and they don&#x27;t coexist with bikes all that much.<p>I do agree with a lot of this article about the uselessness of enforcing outdated road rules to cyclists. I personally will rarely completely stop at stop sign. I find the danger much higher to try to immobilize the bike, un-clip the shoe and start again with a very slow speed (potentially exposing myself for a much longer period of time in that dangerous crossing zone).<p>To solve accidents between all of these actors, I think there should be a simple rule of giving the slowest vehicle always the right of way, which is what courteous people do. A pedestrians should always have priority over a cyclist and or a motorist. If accident happen, the cyclist/motorist should take the full responsibility for it. Likewise a cyclist should have priority over a motorist. The person at fault should be proven guilty unless proven innocent of some unpredictable situation.<p>It is a bit the same on the water, where motor boats have to give way to wind powered boat for the same logical reasons.",1400198011

The point is that publishers somehow need to grasp that DRM serves no useful purposes whatsoever. For that they need examples, and that comes from competition which doesn&#x27;t use DRM.<p><i>> Publishers don&#x27;t want to make consumers&#x27; lives difficult or prevent you from enjoying yourself</i><p>They obviously want that. Since they use DRM which doesn&#x27;t affect pirates but affects those who buy stuff. So the obvious conclusion is that either publishers are morons, or they want to insult all their users, or they use DRM for completely unrelated sinister purposes.<p>What I meant above about competition is simple - the more successful DRM free projects there are, the easier it is to disprove that DRM is needed. The size of the budget is completely irrelevant to the fact that DRM is ineffective against piracy. It equally applies to a low budget or big budget project which spends millions on marketing.<p>Of course we are talking about publishers which are just clueless. Those who use DRM for side purposes won&#x27;t care since they have other goals. Those will be forced by hard competition only. I.e. imagine a big publisher coming which doesn&#x27;t want to be a part of their cartel and makes DRM-free releases. Many would prefer that, and it can force other publishers to drop their crooked reasons when they&#x27;ll start losing profit.<p><i>>  It&#x27;s great that Veronica Mars raised $5.7 million on Kickstarter</i><p>That&#x27;s a bad example.

7752929,comment,7751110,7751865,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is dead wrong.<p>Indies don&#x27;t make nearly as much money as studio titles, nor do they have such a huge investment on the line. Consider that for something like a new superhero movie, the production costs are easily >$100 million and marketing costs are about the same (a 50:50 ratio of production to marketing investment turns out to produce the optimal return, based on empirical measurements). $200 million and up is a lot of money, so films like this are largely financed by presale agreements with distributors. Yes, this can be offset by stars taking a profit share instead of up-front payment and by wealthy investors with deep pockets - but there are limits to both approaches, and neither is sufficient for really expensive projects of the kind the public has come to expect.<p>Of course things like Kickstarter and so on are great and will continue to gain in importance. However, they are much ,much better for established media properties (eg cancelled cult TV shows with an existing fan base, or projects by existing celebrities in other media, like if Justin Bieber decided to start making movies) than they are for innovative products (with new actors/ directors/ writers/ characters).<p>No doubt it will continue to grow and before the end of the decade a crowdfunded project by a bunch of unknowns will turn into a monster runaway cinema hit. But then it will <i>revert to the mean</i>. Anyone who is a filmmaker is familiar with the &#x27;first time director X made a hit movie with a tiny budget of $Y&#x27; story. <i>Blair Witch Project! El Mariachi! Primer!</i> We love stories like this but there are a few things to bear in mind. First, the low-budget figure is not what it cost for you, the consumer, to see it, but what it cost to get it in front of a studio executive who OKed spending the money on making it market-ready. Second, it&#x27;s untrue because there was a list of free stuff as long as your arm in the way of donations from friends of favors owed or suchlike, that most people don&#x27;t have access to. Third, there were hidden costs in time or lost production quality. And fourth, and by far the most important, only one film every few years out of many thousands made every year hits a sweet spot and recoups some very large multiple of its original budget. It&#x27;s like getting a royal flush in poker, or successfully splitting your blackjack hand multiple times: it&#x27;s always a possibility, you could hit an enormous jackpot if you succeed, but odds are that you won&#x27;t.<p>To paraphrase the famous Dov Simens, that&#x27;s why they call it &#x27;show <i>business</i>&#x27; and not &#x27;show <i>luck</i>.&#x27; The business model is that you make an entertaining movie that people want to watch, movie theater owners rent it from you in order to rent out seats and sell expensive snacks, and then later streamers rent it from you and a you make some additional money on hard copies. (There&#x27;s whole additional business model built around merchandise/franchise income like toys and theme park rides, but those are generally limited to family-friendly sci-fi and fantasy films with vast marketing budgets.) You can&#x27;t run a business around the idea of producing surprise movie hits on a shoestring. You build one around the idea of being able to reliably pick projects with commercial potential and reliably match your investment with the profit potential. Essentially it&#x27;s fund management in a market where many of the producers and consumers behave irrationally and unpredictably. If you want to do big deals, then you need to be able to sell the film before it gets made. Publishers are hard-headed about these things not because they are stupid, but because the alternative is losing a ton of other people&#x27;s money and having to exit the industry in fairly short order.<p>So there&#x27;s more DRM-free content every year, yippee. That&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s wonderful in the same way that you can get better digital cameras for less every year and so on. But tell me what fraction of industry revenues this content accounts for, and what the economic inputs and outputs are. It&#x27;s great to see Louis CK put out DRM-free editions of his stand-up performance, but his downside risk on that was maybe $10,000, $25,000 at most. Plus he was already famous. It&#x27;s great that <i>Veronica Mars</i> raised $5.7 million on Kickstarter, but it only made 2/3 of that back at the box office although I anticipate it will break even by the end of its second financial year. And again, that was from a base of a multi-awarded hit cable show that ran for 3 years and had already had several million invested in it. Kickstarter works extremely well if you already have a franchise to leverage, because the marginal cost to the fan-investors of backing the project is pretty low relative to the opportunity-cost value of the time they have already invested in the franchise. But if you don&#x27;t already have a brand, it&#x27;s a very different situation.<p>I&#x27;ve brought this up again and again on DRM-related threads here. Publishers don&#x27;t want to make consumers&#x27; lives difficult or prevent you from enjoying yourself - that&#x27;s a juvenile and inaccurate picture. They&#x27;re businesses that compete intensively against each other and launch a large number of extremely high-risk products each year, many of which never break even. The portion of the public that goes out and expends effort to discover artistic quality is tiny. Most people want to be entertained - and given that the #1 whine about DRM is the &#x27;inconvenience&#x27; it imposes on consumers (eg the original article&#x27;s complaint that having to stop the movie so one family member can let the cat out is an unacceptable loss of enjoyment), I&#x27;m pretty sure that the anti-DRM lobby is not champing at the collective bit to free starving artists held hostage by studios, but rather to watch more or less the same expensively-produced and marketed blockbuster entertainment as everyone else in their demographic cohort.",1400196932

While doing this, they&#x27;ve bungled major Firefox features, ranging from automatic upgrades to the UI design, time and time again. They&#x27;ve neglected to sufficiently resolve long-standing resource usage problems. They&#x27;ve ignored feedback from disappointed Firefox users for years now. They&#x27;ve ignored that this direction obviously isn&#x27;t helping to prevent users from leaving Firefox, while at the same time it&#x27;s driving a lot of users away, and furthermore it isn&#x27;t really bringing in any new users.<p>In my opinion, Mozilla has been its own worst enemy these past several years.

The books come two per grade level, for example 3A and 3B.  They are small books, but filled with content.  They only cost about $12 each.  There are also workbooks available (for more exercises, but you might not need these) and some teaching guides too (that I&#x27;m unfamiliar with).  For someone that was in elementary school 50 years ago, the math lessons look very familiar.  There was one subject covered for which I wished there was more explanation: translating word problems into equations to be solved.  This always came easily to me (I ended up majoring in Math in college), but Singapore Math has an interesting step that seems to work well for kids.  They translate the word problems into a standard diagram where rectangles stand in for quantities and then the equations are derived from the diagrams.  I wasn&#x27;t taught that way, and so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to motivate the correct construction of the rectangles.  Don&#x27;t let this minor complaint disuade you from trying Singapore Math.  Consider the latest international rankings of students, the PISA [2].  Singapore is one from the top (Shanghai-China is number one), and as I understand it, all students in Singapore take the test so there is no selection bias.  Furthermore, their books are in English while all the other top rated countries (China, Korea, Japan, Switzerland, etc.)  have text books that I can&#x27;t read.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com</a> \n[2]<a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/PISA-2012-results-snapshot-Volume-I-ENG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/PISA-2012-results-snaps...</a>",1400196549

Even so, these would only be in those patients who cannot get deep brain stimulation surgery for some reason.

If you have a problem with your thread&#x27;s implementation -- fix it. If you want the compiler&#x27;s help -- use the compiler to write the for comprehensions, or monads for you. Personally, I don&#x27;t think you should need monads for &quot;do X then Y&quot;, and neither does Scala, by the way.

And finally, there are severe problems with Chinese equity markets that make it scary to bet on Yuan against USD.<p>I think at some point in the future, China will stop having an export economy, because advances in manufacturing technology and automation will obviate the need for cheap labor.

7752792,comment,7751110,7751568,3,0,the_af,,,"> How would content producers possibly deter copying without exerting control on the consumption hardware and software? The only answer there is standardized DRM.<p>That&#x27;s not the only possible answer. In fact, there are already content providers (music, games) selling non-DRM&#x27;ed content. Another way of deterring copying is for the author to connect with his/her audience, participate in the community and make it morally hard for all of them to copy his work. This works and I&#x27;ve seen it happen. Some guys will be jerks and pirate stuff anyway (they will do this even with DRM), others will think &quot;hey, the author is a nice person, and he/she makes something I enjoy. I&#x27;ll pay for it and support him/her&quot;. This happens all the time with small-scale communities.<p>Of course, this requires <i>work</i> from the author beyond merely creating something, and it mostly works in the <i>small scale</i>, and he/she will probably not get insanely rich this way. But I doubt -- philosophically speaking -- that there is any inherent right to sell something in the <i>large scale</i>, without direct author-audience interaction, and expect police-state measures to work.

Those problems need to be addressed with direct enforcement before we can possibly consider giving bicyclists any special treatment above the behavior of cars -- specifically because they have already shown that many of them are not capable of using their own discretion with respect to a pedestrian&#x27;s right of way.<p>I spoke to an SFPD officer on Market and 2nd the other day, and he watched as five different cyclists ran a red light stopping vehicular traffic on Market. I asked him why he wasn&#x27;t giving tickets to the cyclists, and he told me that he is specifically not allowed to. He reiterated to me that the official policy of the SFPD is not to enforce traffic violations by cyclists on Market Street. He told me that this is because the SF Bike Coalition has run a campaign vilifying police officers and accusing them of harassing cyclists. This is all at the cost of pedestrian safety.<p>I&#x27;m not making this shit up, either.

This is huge, and perhaps we could just stop there, but...<p>* Firefox had become bloated and slow and a bit crashy. It&#x27;s just true. Google had the resources to write a high-quality new browser (which is pretty huge), and their browser was really really fast and really really stable compared to FF. (It is no longer so stark a difference, cause FF has much improved on speed and stability, and Chrome, as it continued to be developed got the inevitable bloat and bugs that software does. Although Google writes pretty good software, and Chrome is no exception).<p>* FF just wasn&#x27;t innovating much anymore in features, for users or developers. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of (non-ideological) reason to use it, if something else came along. Developers matter because they influence other users (in part by designing their sites with certain browsers as their main testing environment), and developers aren&#x27;t influenced as much by the fact that google.com tells them to download Chrome. But I think FF lost significant dev market/mindshare to Chrome too, in part because Chrome&#x27;s dev tools were way better than FF&#x27;s at that time.<p>Now, if Mozilla made the right or wrong choices to try and recover, we can argue (I think overall they&#x27;ve made a lot of the right choices for the hand they were dealt), but at the point they changed to be &#x27;more like Chrome&#x27;, it was a reaction to already having lost a huge amount of market share.

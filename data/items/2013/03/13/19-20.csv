I would say that hackers who throw together disruptive successes tend to be innovating on market capture, not underlying technology, otherwise they wouldn't have quite as much success without proper education. (Either that, or the hacker is working in Information Tech, where they do have insider knowledge.) That said, market-capture should equate to commercial success, so it does matter. I just don't think it's directly correlated to the innovation you're suggesting.<p>As for the ability of the natural genius to emerge without formal training, of course that's possible-- and increasingly likely thanks to the Web-- but it's still rare enough that I'm skeptical of the claim.",1363204702

Go will acquire its own conventions, but we do not know all of them yet. This is the risk of a clean slate.<p>That's bullshit, Go is <i>not</i> a ""clean slate"", and a number of design issues of Go are known and have been known from the first release regardless of its designer's refusal to acknowledge them. We <i>know</i> pervasive nullable types are a source of errors, we <i>know</i> shared-memory concurrency is an error-prone default, we <i>know</i> a lack of generics makes userland code painful and generics are hard to retrofit in an established language (and even Go's designers know it, why do you think they build special-case generic collections in the interpreter?), we <i>know</i> allowing implicitly ignoring errors is a bad idea and making it easier to ignore than handle errors also is. These are not recent issues, they're well known and there are a number of possible strategies for handling them.<p>And Go's worst sin, to me: we know that foisting complexity and repetitiveness upon the user leads to forgetting, and forgetting leads to mistakes. And that's exactly Go's approach to errors, resources management and shared structures mutability.

If this is your case I simply recommend to spend some time doing things you like, things that energize you, things that get you in a good mood, to get your energy levels up. Once you get there use some of that energy to start planing, make a calendar with your goals and write down your achievements. Do this little by little, baby steps. This is imperative to achieve your goals, therefore you need to go do something else, get energize, come back and do it little by little until it becomes programmed in your super-smart brain.

You can't force isolation of one by using isolation of the other.<p>For requires going stale, I mean when a file originally depends on something but no longer does. The require is likely to linger, especially if the dependency is removed without knowing that it was the entirety or the last of the dependency. This file now has stale dependencies.<p>Then something requiring that file will have that dependency in place and possibly use it without requiring it because of that. This file now has incorrect dependencies.<p>Expand the above across a more complex project and it becomes virtually impossible to verify the correctness of your requires, so you probably just stop trying and require things as needed, which makes it worse.<p>When you finally discover it your changes (in your version control) become less isolated as random requires start popping in and out.<p>This is not a new or unique problem to Ruby, obviously.

And it's only a good trade if <i>the information in the patent</i> is actually valuable.  If there's evidence that that information would still become available in the absence of a patent grant, it becomes clearer that it's not a good trade in this particular case.  Simultaneous filings are about as good a source of such evidence as one could hope for.<p>More broadly, I think the problems we have with the patent system can be seen as being rooted in the fact that there isn't anyone fully empowered to represent the public interest in this negotiation.  The PTO is supposed to do this, in theory, but the examiners are overworked and have the wrong incentive structure.<p>And, there's a key problem: in a dispute over the obviousness of a claimed invention, <i>the burden of proof is on the examiner</i> to show that it's obvious -- which can be very difficult, particularly when the applicant can reply that anything seems obvious in hindsight.

We're (as in, scientists studying nutrition and how utterly wrong food industry has gotten that in the 20th and early 21st century) finally starting to get our collective heads around the benefits of whole foods vs. highly processed foods, and just how badly our bodies deal with the latter.  It may be theoretically possible to create some processed food that's on par with the nutrition of whole foods, but I doubt that anyone alive today knows how to do it.  He may see ""good"" results on some metrics due to a lack of any desire to go hypercaloric -- i.e. there's probably no artificially boosted food reward[1] mechanisms in his glop.  But that won't make up for the glop's likely deficiencies.<p>So an impatient _software engineer_ comes along and claims to have whipped up a drink that eliminates all that.  A task that specialists have so far failed at.<p>> ""I read a textbook on physiological chemistry and took to the internet to see if I could find every known essential nutrient.""<p>I've seen this enough to be sick of it; it seems to be form of the software ""everything is just an [easy] problem"" mindset gone badly wrong.

Egg's on them!<p>Another example of this failure: when software/CS types wander off to do experimental science (e.g. human subjects) without _any_ training in how to do experiment design, data collection, or analysis.

Basically his argument is that, rather than try to secure your wifi, you should just leave it open and make sure your personal computers are secure enough to be used on an open network. He points out that, if you use your laptop on public networks, you have to secure it anyway, so there's no additional risk to having your home wifi basically be a public network.<p>All that may be true (though I would argue that, since you use your home connection a lot more than any other, your risk exposure is much greater and therefore it makes sense to have a layered defense there), but it completely misses the point that you are responsible to your ISP for how your internet connection gets used. Starbuck's may be able to say ""look, we're a public place, we can't possibly control everything that everybody does on our wifi"", and get away with just making people check an ""I agree to your terms of use"" box when they connect to their wifi. You, as a home user, are not likely to get away with that.<p>Schneier also says this: ""if someone did commit a crime using my network the police might visit, but what better defense is there than the fact that I have an open wireless network? If I enabled wireless security on my network and someone hacked it, I would have a far harder time proving my innocence."" This seems backwards to me: if you have enabled wireless security, you know exactly who you have authorized access to--it's whoever you gave your passphrase to. So it's easy to distinguish authorized from unauthorized use. If you leave your wifi open and someone uses it for something nefarious, how can you defend yourself? You're still liable for the use of your internet connection, and you can't say the use was unauthorized because, well, you left your wifi open for anyone to use.",1363202589

Personally, I would call it idiocy :) (not necessarily the lack of semicolons - I like the appearance of e.g. Python - but their automatic insertion).<p>In general, I'd even say that Haskell provides very little syntactic sugar, and the stuff that it does provide is both quite useful and rather understandable. Examples being list comprehensions, or even list syntax to begin with, where [1,2,3] is sugar for 1:(2:(3:[]))). Yes, the do-notation (which is what you normally use with monads) is also sugar, but it's not the difficult part of understanding monads.

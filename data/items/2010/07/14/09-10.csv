1514125,comment,1513706,1514038,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Mocking seems to me to be a perfect example. Of how obvious it is that we are fighting against the flow with so many of our tools and we are merely lacking the advances in language design which embrace these use cases at their heart. It seems very similar to the clumsy, piece-meal attempts at procedural programming through the use of various macros and such-like in the early era of programming, and later of the attempts at object orientation through various techniques and conventions. But none of those efforts were able to fully exploit the potential of procedural programming or object orientation.<p>You can't just bolt such fundamental shifts in programming idiom and practice onto existing languages and expect to achieve maximum potency. It often takes new languages, which have internalized the ""paradigm shift"", to fully achieve the potential of transformative development methodologies.<p>No amount of assembler macros can be as elegant or as effective in facilitating procedural programming as the C language, for example. Similarly, you aren't going to create Python within C unless you already have the idea of Python to work with.<p>I suspect that these aspects (mocking and unit testing especially) will become ingrained in future languages to degrees we can hardly imagine. I suspect that unit testing will be as much a part of many future languages as loops, assertions, and methods are today, and that running unit tests will be such an integral part of the build process that it will take explaining to describe how it's even possible for them to be apart.<p>Unfortunately, I think too many language designers are too satisfied with the current state of affairs and don't see the future in these terms.",1279101394

Even if affiliate programs won't work, you could offer users up the same kind of book list as sort of a customized banner ad.  Being able to serve up that many impressions must be worth something, even if only for a short time.

No professional pitcher looks the same. They each have their own peculiar windup, delivery, and follow-thru. They each have a different selection of pitches. Some are taller than others. Some are from the Dominican Republic. What do they have in common?<p>They've all been pitching for a long ass time.<p>Sure, they have insights on the process. They'll show you their grip on their change-up or how they flick their wrists out before they release their curveball. They'll show you little bits of technique but they'll never be able to teach you how to pitch.<p>You've got to figure it out on your own.<p>Confidence is absolutely key. You're up on the mound.

There are no mentors to run things by.<p>It's all up to you.<p>The first pitch might be off target. That doesn't matter. You've still got at least one more pitch to throw.

What was that last pitch, a fastball, and you missed up and outside with it against a left-handed hitter? Perfect time to throw your slider in for a strike, just nabbing the upper right corner. Now it's 1-1. The hitter is left thinking if the first pitch, way outside that it was, wasn't just some sort of psychological test, a setup, a prelude for the rest of the at-bat.<p>Congratulations, you've just gotten through a single batter.

The trick is that while you must be at least partially aware of both views in order to be a good programmer, you can't program solely from one of them only. CS abstractions won't teach you to work intimately with your computer and, conversely, showing great command of your machine by knowing its eletronic nature and mastering its assembly language won't get you far until you can see on a high level what you're doing.<p>Programming could be said to be the skill of merging—or making— the theory and practice into a working program, and with the emphasis on the merging part itself instead of what is being merged. For example, at the same time, a good programmer must know both something about CS and electrics while still most of the programming work is about the <i>art of making</i>, which is yet another thing.<p>So abstractions are there.

1514074,comment,1513535,1513869,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""but I'd rather not attract women by appearing more confident than I actually am""</i><p>Having read some of the works in question - I have to correct a misconception. PUA isn't about false bravado - that's why the 3-second rule exists, so you approach the woman before your own insecurities kick in and your mind gets way ahead of itself. If anything, it's not an act, it's actual anxiety management so you don't act like a nervous buffoon.<p>I don't see anything wrong with this. We accept insecurity from our friends, families, and other loved ones frequently - but we rarely accept it so readily from strangers. PUA is not the art of <i>maintaining</i> romantic interest, it's the art of <i>initiating</i> it between total strangers - and oftentimes the strategies employed are counter-productive for long-term relationships (which is why everything they say must be taken with a healthy dose of critical thought).<p>> <i>""""confident, funny and slightly unavailable"" appearances, you neuter the possibility of a genuine emotional connection.""</i><p>And that's not what it's about. So here's the thing, PUAs work in a hyper-competitive environment where, even before their arrival, it was already a hotbed of attempted pickups and blatant come-ons. Their strategies are mostly about rising above the rabble of men trying to hook up with drunk girls and appearing more attractive than the sea of dudes in the room.<p>All of this is still relevant to people who aren't in a sweaty nightclub and aren't just looking for one-night stands. ""confident, funny, and slightly unavailable"" is a <i>great</i> place to start, especially when your target is desirable and frequently hit on. You can connect all you want once you've beaten the crowd of suitors - that's the point.",1279099023
1514073,comment,1510144,1510817,0,0,andrew1,,,"The process you've described isn't really hedging, it's effectively closing out a trade, either through booking a profit, or mitigating a loss. The equivalent in the equities world is roughly these two cases; today you buy some shares in Acme Oil Company, tomorrow they announce that they've discovered a massive oil well and their share price rockets, so you sell and book a nice profit; or today you buy some shares in Acme Oil Co, tomorrow they announce they've sprung a leak off the coast of Florida and their share price falls, you sell your shares to mitigate the losses you've suffered (and the potential for more losses).<p>That is not hedging; hedging is the process of considering (at the point of purchase) how you can protect your investment against unquantified events. For example you might decide that Apple as a company is undervalued so you want to buy some of their shares, but the markets seem volatile at the moment so you want to hedge yourself against large movements in the index.<p>You can do this by selling short on the index at the same time as you buy your Apple shares. So suppose you're correct about Apple (that they're undervalued) and the market realises this and their share price increases by 1% relative to the index, without your hedge this could see your investment say gain 4% if the index goes up 3%, or lose 2% if the index falls by 3%, so you get either +4% or -2%.<p>Now suppose that you have your index hedge in place, if the market rises by 3%, you get 4% on Apple -3% on the index = 1%, if the market falls by 3% you get -2% on Apple and 3% on the index = 1%. So either way you get the 1% profit through your Apple intuition. By selling the index you've hedged yourself against movements in the underlying market.<p>So to hedge a bet on something like Roger Federer winning against Rafael Nadal in a match today, you need to try and find something else to bet on at the same time. I can't really think of how to do this though.",1279098904

Glad to see d3 getting addition options with a much higher level of abstraction for those users who just want to make a common visualization with a minimum of fuss.<p>I&#x27;ve just started my on take on a high-level chart library based on d3, one that leverages React components [1].  I&#x27;m hoping to retain an equally simple interface as MetricGraphics.  In fact, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll draw a lot of inspiration from this excellent chart library.<p>My library is still very early stage, but I&#x27;d love to get feedback on possible directions from React users and others interested in dataviz  (someone mentioned candlesticks, which I&#x27;m noting down in my todo).<p>1.  <a href=""http://esbullington.github.io/react-d3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esbullington.github.io/react-d3/</a>",1415980789

It&#x27;s that the job your credentials seem to command isn&#x27;t the type of gig any company is willing to risk hiring a fresh out of college guy to do.  your academic creds, while wonderful, are simply NOT real world experience.<p>Your PHD leads recruiters to think you&#x27;ll demand 6 figures and a SR position.

Software developers assume you&#x27;d love to have their regular updates, even if those updates also change interfaces and modify or even outright break/remove functionality however they feel like. If you don&#x27;t apply the updates, you don&#x27;t get security fixes either, so for any software that is at all involved with sharing data or communicating on-line many users have little choice. The idea of long term support for any stable software that people actually rely on is a joke for many projects. And that&#x27;s before we even get to all the DRM/activation junk.<p>Ironically, the worst offenders are probably Chrome and Firefox. IME, the next worst offenders are often the supposedly high-end professional software that comes with a thousands-of-dollars-per-seat price tag -- assuming you can even buy a copy instead of renting it these days.<p>I&#x27;m mildly optimistic that a new generation of software seems to be arriving where people are expected to pay for good work but the prices are much more reasonable: not App Store peanuts, not Enterprice Pricing (call for a quote, because hell will freeze over before we publish any useful information publicly). A lot of these tools are relatively small or specialised, but they do their jobs well, they get very favourable feedback from users, and they have real, commercially viable development organisations behind them. Also, they rarely incorporate the user-hostile junk. So good work can still be done commercially, and of course for some of the important geek-friendly software like development tools and OS/server/networking infrastructure there are Open Source projects that are usefully stable, reliable and comprehensive. I look forward hopefully to a day when these kinds of projects are the norm for software we rely on, and we can all get on with using our computers without constantly fighting with them.",1415980242

8607665,comment,8605978,8607322,0,0,tom_b,,,"All I have is anecdotes, but I&#x27;ll hazard some guesses.<p>The talent shortage has a strong geographic component.  In SV or NYC, job search sites (a poor way to gauge actual demand, but whatever) seem to list 1,000s of available Java/C# gigs, with substantial numbers of listing that include javascript.  But I would probably lump those three languages together as placeholder flags to indicate &quot;standard enterprise developer&quot; jobs.  Most of these job listing seem to fall on the entry-level, with a steep fall-off in mid-level offerings, and a few (mythical?) mega-$$ listings.  These types of jobs feel more &quot;credential sensitive&quot; to me - if your resume (not CV) doesn&#x27;t say Comp Sci or maybe MIS, you probably get binned immediately.<p>Leave those regions, job listings seem to drop.  If we can trust these listings to reflect some level of region-comparable demand, we might guess that in Seattle, WA or Chicago, IL, there is about 1/2 the demand of SV and NYC.  Cut it down even more in places like Austin, TX or RTP, NC, maybe 1/6 or 1/8 the demand of SV and NYC?  I&#x27;m sure we could include a bunch of other cities in those tiers, but maybe those are loosely representative.<p>I often wonder how much job demand looks inflated on these job boards though.  A quick glance at Java in NYC, NY on indeed.com shows a few big staffing companies with hundreds of listings.  I usually assume there are bunch of duplicate listings from staffing companies for a single position.<p>I think a lot of lower-level gigs out there are filled by kind-of-passable candidates not making anything like the SV salary numbers that get thrown out on HN frequently.  Among strong engineers I personally know in my region, several are frequently contacted by recruiters for jobs that are, at best, side-ways moves for them (eg doing the same gig at some different place for roughly the same money).  A PhD (and maybe even a MS) <i>might</i> scare employers at this level?<p>The other part of this, especially regarding the original article, is that deep, strong statistical/machine learning/magic fairy dust hacking gigs are much less numerous that the standard enterprise dev jobs and that those gigs are even more restrictive in recruiting nature.<p>Meaning, if you are really recruiting for a top-notch &quot;data science&quot; person, you are probably(?) looking for intensive credentials or portfolios.  So MS or PhD in Applied Math or Statistics with easily demonstrated programming skills or a set of completed projects cast in the &quot;data science&quot; space.  And if you&#x27;re not recruiting at that level, the &quot;data science&quot; label means &quot;query some data sources to generate a tabular report, maybe with some rollups.&quot;",1415980213

Currently the time setting (e.g. the default 10 minutes) is the time threshold between successive edits for grouping edits together. Note that this only affects grouping while the table is loading, it does not update existing groups. The &quot;Group&quot; button groups the whole selection together, while the &quot;Ungroup&quot; button shatters the whole selection into individual atomic edits. It&#x27;s a bit complicated and could definitely need some work still, but I feel something similar to this is needed to provide an easy default overview of edits but also allow users to fine-tune to view the exact diffs that they wish to see. Any further suggestions here would be more than welcome.<p>Ignoring certain filenames based on regexp is coming soon, probably already in 1.2.1, within a week or two.

The Baltic sea and the Danish straits are important waterways to Russia, St Petersburg&#x27;s access to the North Sea and the Atlantic.  Russia&#x27;s access to the Mediterranean goes through Turkey&#x27;s (NATO) internal waterway. Both routes could effectively be shut down by a hostile navy.<p>Those are the conventional military-strategic concerns that are supposedly making Russia so nervous about NATO aggression. Crimea is (allegedly) important for Russia&#x27;s naval security, so had to go back to Russian control. Actively driving a geographically strategic country, with resources into increasing it&#x27;s naval power and seeking an alliance is losing at strategy.<p>On the economic, Oil prices have recently dropped. They may drop further. Russia is very reliant on oil revenues for public funding. Europe and the US are nearing the point of sanctions. Foreign investment is taking a hit. New energy projects like gas pipelines are unlikely. They do not need some pointless costly conflict.<p>IMO, it comes down to this. An direct NATO-Russia conflict is unlikely.

8607586,comment,8606485,8606937,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"I think you&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head. Twitter&#x27;s UX is painful, but that&#x27;s really only the half of it. The real issue is that Twitter, regardless of how easy it can be made to use, is inherently useful to a very small proportion of people.<p>I call it an &quot;extrovert&quot; product. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll catch some flak from bringing up the introvert/extrovert axis on HN (as if we don&#x27;t get that topic often enough here!). But hear me out. Twitter is for people who like conferences. Twitter is for people who like stages. Twitter is for people who want to have conversations with each other, and also want the world to overhear those conversations. To me, at the other end of the spectrum, that behavior strikes me as weird. It seems painfully and willfully fake and artificial. It seems like so much peacocking, forced smiling, and posturing. It seems like &quot;networking,&quot; in the most brutally painful sense of that word. I don&#x27;t get it. I mean, I grok it, but it holds no interest for me.<p>As an occasional journalist, I&#x27;m often told I &quot;have&quot; to use Twitter. It&#x27;s &quot;part of the job&quot; to be a &quot;public figure&quot; these days. I&#x27;m not interested in being a public figure. I don&#x27;t begrudge people who are. If anything, I envy and admire their ability to navigate the cognitive dissonance that the Twitter private-in-public dynamic forces. But I just can&#x27;t do it. It drains me. I find using Twitter to be like doing homework, or eating my vegetables. It&#x27;s not fun. It&#x27;s a chore. When a consumer tech product feels like a chore, I don&#x27;t bother; life&#x27;s too short.<p>Twitter is in an unfortunate situation, in that the company was forced to scale massively and go public at around the same time its true user base and use cases were emerging from the noise. Now it&#x27;s in the unenviable position of having to make billions of dollars in revenue, and of having to compete with the likes of Facebook for a putative billion-something number of users (which it&#x27;ll never get), when at its essence, Twitter is a restricted product. A substantial portion of the human population will never get any personal utility from using Twitter. Twitter isn&#x27;t a bad product; it&#x27;s just not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything Twitter can do to make me want to use it, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in that sentiment.<p>It&#x27;s not you, Twitter. It&#x27;s me.",1415979498

Day to day, at work, our CRM, bug/issue/project tracker, document management, help-desk software, phone system management, knowledge base, email, document/spreadsheet software are all web-based. Historically, those were all native &#x27;programs&#x27; (as late as mid 2000s) and they were all crap.<p>>All for something that could have been created as a native app much easier.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that. Some things are easier with html/css/js than with a native framework, but it&#x27;s not just about developer comfort. Web applications provide huge benefits to users over native apps - that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re willing to deal with the development stack (which is getting better every year).<p>>Imagine the man hours and effort that went into building Gmail.<p>It&#x27;s probably not that bad. Writing maintainable web code isn&#x27;t that hard these days.<p>>There&#x27;s a lot of reasons that people have gravitated towards apps on phones<p>Yes. It all really boils down to performance. If you could get 60fps with a web-app on mobile (which in principle you should achieve), I don&#x27;t think users would care.

I did see the need for the skills.<p>I also believe that there should be at least a strong mobile offering with any web application now-a-days. That said, here&#x27;s my thought on the matter.<p>UI sucks for everything. It really seems to have always sucked and probably will continue to suck. Swing is a pain to develop. WinForms too. I assume from looking at Cocoa code, so is Apple.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a Pomodoro app during this whole time. Just getting lists to work efficiently in Android is a bitch. You have to serialize objects in and out of view items to make sure scrolling doesn&#x27;t absolutely crap out when you&#x27;ve got a lot of items. Even with Swift, the same is fundamentally true in iOS.<p>Making a native app that looks 1) unique and 2) nice is terrible. You have to have a team with a designer and developer. Anything less and you&#x27;re going to be out of the market longer. Making a native app that meets the two criteria above on multiple platforms is incredibly time consuming.<p>So I&#x27;ve now decided to use Ionic + Angularjs + Cordova. I&#x27;ve been on that platform for 2 weeks now. In that time, I&#x27;ve learned Web SQL, Angularjs, Ionic and enough Cordova to get plugins installed. I am also further along than I ever was in my Android development. It even looks pretty using the default Ionic styling (I got a free UI team by using their stuff).<p>So even if I accept your speculation that apps will dominate the world. I assume it will be developed on an HTML5 or HTML* stack. That does require &quot;interoperable universal interaction standards&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll continue this speculation to say that I think the appearance of apps will merge. There is little reason to have a brand for Android and a brand for iOS and a brand for Tizen, etc. Ionic apps look like Ionic apps without having to spend a lot of GUI logic saying stupid things like, If Android, put the tabs on the top. Again, you need a common standard for this type of design and that is HTML.<p>P.S.
I know that games will suck in JS in the browser view. I know that JS has some serious issues with performance that will probably not be overcome for sometime. I&#x27;ve seen that analysis blog post too. But for CRUD apps like the Pomodoro or Foursquare or LinkedIn, Ionic and its ilk are perfect. The reason is, to beat the horse, is because of advancing open, compliant standards. CSS animations can now be hardware accelerated. JS performance is constantly improving (even if it is a horrible, horrible language).HTML is being banged out to house newer features. This isn&#x27;t a polemic about how native has no values. It&#x27;s a polemic against the idea that CRUD apps should have gone native.",1415978234

Take houses. If people could sell houses made of compressed dryer lint, some would. And some poor people would buy. And many of them would be horribly burned in fires.<p>What&#x27;s the cost? It depends on how much responsibility we take in caring for them. Do we pay to treat their burns? Do we pay for their funerals? Do we pay to raise their children and give them counseling? What about the lost potential of all those people to contribute to the world? What about the value of life itself?<p>> One outcome of the arguments for net neutrality, and your argument in particular, is that there&#x27;s no means for providing low-cost services designed for the less-rich. It&#x27;s not obvious to me that setting a bar this high is a good thing for the lower economic rung in our society.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious to me, either. But it seems like Facebook-only phones are a bit like dryer-lint houses. How much would it cost society to have its bottom ranks unable to read Wikipedia or look up medical conditions on MedLinePlus or comparison shop on Amazon?<p>And if such plans succeed, how long until we have to consider every ISP&#x27;s plans with &quot;features&quot; such as &quot;doesn&#x27;t block category X&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t throttle site Y&quot;?",1415977671

The newer models have a bigger motor and are better at climbing and stopping by all accounts. I haven&#x27;t had any reliability issues and have been able to ride it every time I wanted to. Recently though the range has reduced and I am hoping its just a single battery cell that needs replacing or rebalancing. I haven&#x27;t opened it up to look and will most likely send it to evolve to diagnose. It still gets more range than the boosted board so its very usable.<p>I think battery problems will be discussed more frequently as electric boards age. They make up a significant portion of the board cost and I hope suppliers have a good strategy to help customers when problems arise.<p>Boosted boards look awesome and I can&#x27;t wait to try one someday. I only ride for fun and its typically 45-60 minutes at an average speed around 14-16mph, so a boosted board falls a little short in their range.

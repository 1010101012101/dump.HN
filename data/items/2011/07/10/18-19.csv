But the writer's own article indicates that adult stem cells were used here.<p>Some opponents have argued that stem-cell research is useless as well as, in the case of embryonic stem-cell research, ethically questionable. I take it the author's point is that now we can prove the general case: stem-cell research can lead to cures, and so disprove one of the (tactical) arguments of opponents. Rush Limbaugh at one point said embryonic stem-cell research in particular is useless, so he won't be bothered by this news.",1310324299

Technically it's very challenging to make fine-grained visibility match up with user expectations.  Coupling this with the fact that social networks make more money from public data means that social network privacy is going to be a dangerously shifting landscape during the growth phase until norms are established.<p>Facebook has always had the best privacy controls of any social network, but they get repeatedly burned in the press on pushing the privacy envelope.  The criticisms are fair, but how could expect a business that makes its money from this data to behave any differently?<p>We would all be better off if we just treated all social networks like Twitter by default instead of having some misplaced faith that businesses are going to protect our privacy when it is only marginally (at best) in their interest to do so.",1310324049

Or show it on a Jumbotron at the Super Bowl.  Or email it to your boss.  That's unlikely, though.  I don't think Google in its current form will abuse that right.<p>However, since many current users are likely to outlive Google, a real problem will arise when Google fades away sometime in the next twenty or thirty years and is acquired, or Google+ is spun off into a company that then goes bankrupt.  All content ever posted will be treated as an asset to be liquidated in the most lucrative way possible.<p>In other words, Google+ is just like Facebook, and you have to treat everything posted there as ""eventually public.""

Regardless of adoption, quite often the buyer is not the user, and the user is very rarely the early adopter.<p>There is nothing wrong with serving all audiences, and creating software that doesn't suck (in fact, you should), but with poor sales teams, presentations and RFP's you will struggle for adoption in enterprise, period.<p>Hacker Centric cultures are huge and are very important imo, but it remains key to understand the increased weight on a strong Business Development team in enterprise.<p>Dealing with enterprise is not easy. Generally speaking, whatever software you are selling is displacing something else (even if that displacement is administrative assistants). Thus there is a high degree of complexity, process changes etc. that change how the game must be played vs. B2C",1310323115

2748290,comment,2747876,2747876,2,0,ap22213,,,"I don't think the author understands the dynamics of the enterprise market.  The companies mentioned in the article are definitely not the rule, and I don't see a trend here.  I'm guessing that those companies don't have wide adoption across the largest of companies either.<p>First, the person with the purse is not usually the end-user.  Therefore, features, capabilities lists and slide decks are generally more valuable than product design.<p>Second, the person with the purse is not usually the bringer of new tech.  The decision-maker isn't usually the company's earlier adopter. Large companies select and condition for certain types of people to fit certain molds.  That person typically has had, ""pick your battles carefully"" drilled into them, and they tend to avoid making unnecessary risks.<p>Third, companies only begin to change when they're under pressure, and at that point, their internal software systems aren't usually their primary focus.  Large companies only make big changes in software when they see others succeeding at it, when it's mandated, when the ROI is obvious, when the employees are uprising over it, or finally, when they want to seem the industry vanguard.<p>Fourth, FUD still rules in the enterprise.  It's much easier to fall back on the tried-and-true than to take a risk with uncertain results.  And, if the tried-and-true comes from the 'best thinkers around' (e.g. the high-end academics and other big company employees), they're easily adopted.  Try to see how hard it is to get a REST API adopted in the enterprise, and you'll understand.<p>Fifth, enterprise procurement can be dominated by RFP processes that generally tends to favor big lists of things other than usability and openness.  Sometimes it's who is the cheapest.  Other times, it is who is most secure.  Or, who is the most reliable.  It's rarely which product is the most well-designed.<p>Sixth, enterprises are _extremely_ process driven and have custom workflows for everything.  The employees are very attached to those workflows.  It usually takes a team of fast-talking consultants to piece together a Frankenstein monster system from available APIs to get those workflows to work.  It's better to change the workflows at the beginning, but that rarely happens (then you have training issues, which is a whole other issue).<p>We will only see better designed enterprise software when the small companies that are using them now become big companies and have that mindset written into their corporate principles list.",1310322770

You already have the choice of fully explicating a thought using multiple simple, unambiguous clauses which are clearly separated. Authors may neglect this liberty for the sake of art; just as many would like to have that unambiguity, but neglect it because it is meticulous. And now you are going to argue against making parentheses more generally acceptable-- which would in most cases be little more than a stylistic change, favoring a grammatical construct which already exists in the language.<p>Furthermore, look to the Lojban community for examples of poetry and literature in a truly unambiguous language (a far cry from the English suggested by saulrh).",1310322469

If you can get the information required to select the right contacts without seeing a professional, I think that's your right. If you get it wrong because, well you really should have seen a professional, that's your problem.<p>A lot of the regulations concerning doctor supervision for drugs and medical devices are intended to prevent companies from marketing devices that are ineffective or dangerous to consumers who don't have enough information to make a good decision.

But most do, because the point of policy debate is not to wax poetic about your beliefs in a passionate attempt to persuade others, but rather to play a highly technical game against challenging opponents.<p>I never liked the alternate forms of debate that attempt to re-create some golden era of slow talking persuasion because the decisions made are often arbitrary.

It starts off as a small project one-off, and I think nah I don't have to include jQuery for something small if I just code these tiny DOM helper functions.<p>And there hasn't been a single time, when after an hour or so of coding, I didn't wish I had started out using jQuery right away :)<p>But sometimes then it's already too far, easier to just kludge along and finish the task than include jQuery and rewrite all the code so far to use it.<p>So how's this preferable again?",1310321329

It's unfortunate that it gets called the ""80/20 Rule"" because people see that and think, Oh, the two numbers have to add to 100.<p>It's not a <i>rule</i>.  It's the idea that things are not always as balanced/equal/proportioned as one might hope or expect.<p>For example, there's the claim that, in the USA,  25 percent of households own 87 percent of all U.S. wealth.  It's an example of the Pareto Principle in the form of 87/25.  100 only plays a role insofar as nether value can exceed it (since the numbers refer to percentages).",1310321215

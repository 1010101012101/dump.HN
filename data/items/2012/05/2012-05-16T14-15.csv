For example, string interpolation involves <i>one</i> fewer character than concatenation, yet the effect on readability would be hard to overstate.<p>A similar feature in another language is PHP's ability to mix in with HTML. It would be utterly trivial to convert the HTML sections of a PHP file to echo statements. Yet this tiny bit of sugar goes a huge distance toward making up for the language's short comings (also known as ""almost everything else about PHP"").",1337180290

But the concepts are much simpler.<p>AdWords: When people search for something, we'll show them your ad, which they'll click, and then buy something.<p>Facebook: At various times, we'll show people your ad. People will click on it, but the vast, vast majority won't buy. But you've just <i>engaged</i> with them. So you need a fan page and the right kind of content to put on it. If you do this <i>right</i>, you'll build brand loyalty and increase sales in the long run. Did we mention you can use Facebook ads to drive fans to your Facebook page?<p>Conceptually, Facebook is way more complicated, and less easily outsourced. You can hire an AdWords guy, throw money at him, and get results. With Facebook? Not so much. You can try to outsource it, but it's expensive, and everyone will tell you ""you're doing it wrong"" (because you are), which is becoming a very common theme with Facebook ads.<p>If everyone is ""doing it wrong"", does ""it"" really work?<p>When selling AdWords, the most common objection I get is ""nobody clicks those links"". That is, of course, extremely easy to overcome.<p>When talking about Facebook, the first question is, ""what's a fan page, and where are these ads? Can you just do it all for me?"" They usually haven't got a clue where to start, and their first instinct is to pass it off to someone else so they don't have to think about it.

My next door neighbor is a landscape architect and is a huge fan of them -- they virtually eliminate fatal accidents.  Roundabouts normalize traffic, creating a continuous flow of more evenly spaced cars with overall greater throughput.  With islands in the middle, they are much safer for pedestrians.<p>There are two downsides.  They really require much more space than a traditional intersection.  They also remove ""traffic gaps"" between major streets that permit people to make a left hand turn out of a neighborhood.<p>He's not a huge fan of 2-lane roundabouts.  They create an incentive for drivers to cheat by driving down middle of both lanes, staying at 35/40 rather than slowing down to 25 go around the round about.  They also cause confusion when someone gets into the wrong lane (left/center lane must go straight through) and this reduces throughput.  Perhaps there is a minimum/maximal traffic where they work effectively.<p>After using roundabouts at nearby intersections, I'd also add that they are much more attractive.  Waiting at a light causes stress (and people tend to ""text"", causing more delays).  Given the chance, I prefer to take routes that use roundabouts.  I've timed them, and they are faster and more consistent then traditional 4-way-lights, especially at intersections where left/right hand turns normally cause traffic backups.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.annarbor.com/news/roundabout-planned-for-geddes-and-ridge-roads-in-superior-township-as-part-of-new-charter-school-roa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annarbor.com/news/roundabout-planned-for-geddes-a...</a>",1337178429

If they agree to a date when they will pay you, call them that day and &quot;remind&quot; them and get verbal confirmation that they will pay on that day. Ask that a reference number/receipt be emailed to you as soon as they payment has gone through. Call back later (or the next day if they don&#x27;t pickup) to confirm that they kept to their agreement.<p>2.) Call them up and have a chat about the upcoming work and let them know that it&#x27;s in danger of not being completed because you can&#x27;t start it without payment for the past work. Stay professional and tell them from a strictly business point of view, you cant afford to lose any more money on their job. You&#x27;d <i>LOVE</i> to help them, but you just can&#x27;t and you&#x27;ll have to find work elsewhere and most likely won&#x27;t be availible.<p>3.) If they screen your calls and hide behind receptionists or sub-ordinates, let the sub-ordinates know why you are calling. &quot;Can you pass on a message for me? I am calling regarding invoice #780 for $7,400 which is now 55 days overdue.&quot; This always felt unprofessional for me, but it got results.

Facebook seems interested in D, Apple has Swift, Microsoft has some sort of secret project they are working on, Google has Go, and Mozilla has Rust.  Even c++ seems to be attempting to modernize with the new additions to it&#x27;s spec. And now we see a desire for c itself to change.  I wonder if our industry is at a turning point where managed languages aren&#x27;t quite cutting it, but no one is comfortable going back to the &#x27;good old days&#x27;.<p>On a personal note, I like the idea of friendly C so much that I finally made an HN account.  One of my favorite things to do is to take things apart and understand them.  I was mortified when I learned the real meaning of undefined behavior in c/c++.  It seems like the only way to be sure you understand a C program is to check the generated machine code.  Even worse is that when I try to talk to other developers about undefined behavior, I tend to get the impression that they don&#x27;t actually understand what undefined behavior means.  I can&#x27;t think of a way to verify what they think it means without insulting their intelligence, but hopefully the existence of something like friendly C will make it an easier discussion to have.",1409195563

The deep bore tunnel was the most expensive and riskiest of all the options to replace the viaduct. For a while there was hope, but it turned out to be just as much of a shitshow as most detractors imagined. The tunnel was supposed to have been open to traffic sometime in 2015.

8124516,comment,8123207,8123207,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Are we thinking of the problem incorrectly? Math may actually be our enemy here. (Egads!)<p>So yes, for a fixed problem domain, the information transversing it requires topological constraints. Or another words, the fact that the data is structured requires the network to be traversible.<p>So how about this? We remove the structured requirement from the data. My device &quot;knows&quot; several other devices. Each device has some biometric identifying data to show who is using it currently. Those devices send my device unstructured data and app code from time to time. Each device decides who and what to share things with and whether and how much to trust incoming material. The data and the app are linked through a cataloging system provided by the sender.<p>The trick is this: each device really only makes one decision: how much do I trust the other devices? If trust is established, the app and code can continue to propagate. So we&#x27;re sort of making viruses a good thing!<p>Now your data has no structure, so there&#x27;s nothing to coordinate. If some of the initial apps helped folks communicate, then you could communicate to those you trusted. I could imagine some &quot;master&quot; data types that all devices could use: URL, IPv6, Text, HTML, JSON, XML, email, IM, etc. You could even have some master device types.<p>The beauty of this is that you start building security at the same time you&#x27;re doing anything else -- because if you don&#x27;t, somebody&#x27;s going to own your machine, and rather quickly. Each device has no knowledge of the whole, but it has to quickly evolve a very complex and nuanced understanding of what it&#x27;s willing to store and do for other devices.<p>I don&#x27;t think the math would work on this at all, but I think it&#x27;s a workable system - much the same as a cocktail party is a terrible place to interview people, yet lots of folks end up with jobs because of conversations held around cocktail parties.

There is a whole scale of ASDs, which have very different causes and symptoms and hardly could be fit in a single oversimplified category. Especially when used in media.<p>Some causes are &quot;environmental&quot; and of personal experiences, like childhood traumas or, which is the most common scenario, lack of proper treatment by parents and abusing by others as &quot;being stupid&quot;. These conditions could be successfully treated by various CBTs, including those based oon &quot;overcoming ignorance&quot;, to which I am myself a living proof.<p>But there are also various neurological disorders which cannot be lifted by mere CBTs.<p>So, the meme of autism as in characters like Rocky or Travis (these are the most &quot;realistic&quot; ones) or modern memes of autistic techies or hackers (with a very few well-known exceptions) are, well, a stupid memes. Life of an ordinary person with Aspergers (as they call us) is by no means a movie. It is just a severe condition of confusion, frustration and pain.<p>Unfortunately, modern media are made out of memes because common folks cannot grasp the subtleties of reality, which is indeed a not easy task.<p>So, non-neuroligical condition changed by a improvised CBT is not such a great news.

Until you make the choice you have opportunity to acquire some valuable things. When you make the choice you&#x27;ve lost all the things you didn&#x27;t choose.<p>This leads to easy ways of alleviating anxiety. You just need to mentally devalue all the things you are supposed to choose from and when you make the choice, immediately devalue things you haven&#x27;t chosen even more (getting hyped over the thing you just chose won&#x27;t help because anxiety comes not for the lack of appreciation of what you gained but for too much appreciation for the things you&#x27;ve lost opportunity to obtain).",1406971455

I try to learn from their contributions, so I really\ndo appreciate their efforts. One of the possible ways they contribute is\nby down-voting me or stating their disagreement with me. Either way, I\nlearn something new, so I still appreciate their efforts.<p>If pg replied to me and told me that I got it all wrong, and I got\nclobbered with a bazillion down-votes, then I&#x27;m the person who just\nlearned something new, albeit the hard way. Everyone else also gets to\nlearn from my rather public mistakes.<p>Those funny little up and down vote buttons exist for good reason, but\nhow to use them has never formally been defined (to my knowledge) by any\nof the people running HN/YC. The complete lack of defining usage has\nalways seemed to be entirely intentional; with every feature of HN, you\nare expected and trusted to use it wisely. You are being trusted with\nprivileges of voting, flagging, submitting, and commenting. If you abuse\nthe trust and the privileges, you&#x27;ll lose them.<p>All people suffer from the same delusion; we believe our own interests\nare interesting to others. When you try to make a contribution of\nsomething interesting and useful, and you miserably &quot;fail&quot; by all\nnoticeable metrics like points, then once again, you learn something\nnew. I can honestly say that <i>my</i> interests are rarely interesting to\nothers. If you don&#x27;t believe me, go look at the &quot;submissions&quot; link in my\nprofile to prove the point. Though you can&#x27;t see the point counts on my\ncomments, I&#x27;ll openly admit that my comments fare no better than my\nsubmissions. If take a look, you&#x27;ll see that I &quot;fail&quot; regularly, but I\nkeep trying to contribute useful and interesting things.<p>An important number to look at is the &quot;avg&quot; in the user profile. It is\nthe average score on comments you make. The default value for each\ncomment is 1, an &quot;avg&quot; below one means your comments are a hindrance in\nthe eyes of your fellow HN contributors, and an &quot;avg&quot; above one means\nyour comments are successfully contributing to discussions. If your\n&quot;avg&quot; is about 2, then on average every time you comment, at least one\nperson appreciated the effort of your contribution, and put in their\neffort to up-vote your comment.<p>Check out the avg for the HN user grellas [1]. Every time he puts in the\neffort to type one of his infamously fantastic comments, at least 53+\npeople appreciated it (and remembered to scroll back up and give him an\nup-vote ;-). Even if you disagree with him on something, you can still\nappreciate the effort he put into his contribution, and the experience\nand expertise behind his opinions...<p>Yes, you can disagree with someone, and still appreciate their effort\nenough to return the favor in kind with your up-vote. Since there are no\nrules or guidelines on voting, you&#x27;re free to use your votes wisely.<p>I tend to lack useful experience and expertise on most subjects, so all\nI have is my generally uninformed opinions. Some people in my position\nwill sit quietly and learn from others, but other people in my position\nwill try to become informed enough to ask good questions. A good\nquestion is a contribution. I doubt the good questions get up-voted as\nmuch as the deserve since most of the attention goes to the person who\nshows up with a good answer.<p>I <i>really really try</i> to remember to up-vote the good questions, but I&#x27;m\nsure I forget more often than not. Just like everybody else, I&#x27;m\nregularly distracted by the good answers, and after reading the good\nanswer, the good question always seems less useful. I&#x27;d bet there&#x27;s some\ncognitive bias at work in all this, but sadly, I can&#x27;t name it.<p>Sometimes good answers are opinions backed by experience and expertise,\nbut other times good answers are backed by references. I&#x27;m just a sucker\nfor up-voting answers with references, in fact, I scan for them.<p>Down-votes happen to everyone, so learn what you can divine form the\nexperience, and let it go. It&#x27;s just a fact of life that <i>someone</i> on\nthe Internet will probably disagree vehemently. Also, mistakes happen in\nvoting, and there&#x27;s no way to correct your own voting mistakes.<p>The down-voting feature is a privilege you earn. I&#x27;ve always been\nstrongly in the &quot;up-vote-the-good-stuff&quot; camp, so something needs to be\nfairly egregious for me to down-vote it. For me, vehemently disagreeing\nis never enough to warrant a down-vote. There needs to be some aspect of\nmalice. The same is true and to a higher degree for flags. Just like\neverybody else on the planet, I&#x27;ve got a lot of practice being wrong and\nuninteresting, so I try to be tolerant with others.<p>The site moderators do not make the down-voted comments fade, the HN\nforum code [3] running on the server does this automatically. The mods\nget unfairly blamed for a lot of things they don&#x27;t actually do, and most\nof the misplaced blame is due to users not understanding or studying the\navailable forum code and docs. HN was originally written as a test of a\nnew programming language called &quot;arc&quot; [4], but most users are unprepared\nto invest the time to learn a new language and understand the forum code\nbase. I am fluent, well, was fluent, in a few related Lisp dialects, and\nI&#x27;ve only put in the time to barely scratch the surface of how the HN\nforum code really works. The only person I have to blame for not knowing\nall the details is myself.<p>A primary problem with all discussion forums and user supported link\naggregation sites is the endless competition for both the attention and\neffort of others. Most of the HN Guidelines [2] can be written as a\nsingle guideline, &quot;Don&#x27;t be the jerk begging, baiting, or manipulating\nothers for their attention and effort.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re like me and reliably &quot;fail&quot; at contributing useful and\ninteresting comments and submissions according to the flawed metric of\npoints, then you still ought to be happy. You tried to contribute, and\nyou had the courage to put your own interests out there for others to\njudge, but far more importantly, the lack of points also implies the\nlack of using attention grabbing engagement tactics, so you just\nsucceeded at staying out of the endless fray of countless attention\nseekers.<p>If linkbait outrage porn or regurgitation reporting is far more popular\nby the metric of up-votes over time, then I&#x27;m actually grateful that my\ninterests are elsewhere. It just means I have a much better chance to\ncontribute something different, unexpected, and hopefully interesting.<p>Lastly you get the references, but please realize they are not intended\nto support my personal opinions. Those are my own, and right or wrong, I\nhope they&#x27;re useful and interesting for you and everyone else.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grellas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grellas</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/HackerNews/HN"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/HackerNews/HN</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://arclanguage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org</a>",1406970867

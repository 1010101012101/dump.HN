I spent most of the time refactoring the demo game code to something a bit more OO / to my style though. I don&#x27;t know if that was good for performance, but it pleased me.<p>But yeah, as another commenter stated, it just doesn&#x27;t have the leverage as the bigger engines have (U4, Unity, etc), and those have very competitive pricing for hobbyist developers nowadays.

Yes, the checks aren&#x27;t free, but they aren&#x27;t very costly either in practice, and much of the cost is down to C compilers not being optimized for generating range-checking code.<p>I feel you&#x27;re also possibly missing a longer term feedback loop issue.

So shareware died, and shareware authors went to the dark side.</i><p>HAHAHA. Oh, jeez... /wipes a tear. You clearly have no idea how the shareware model actually works.<p>Shareware is very <i>very</i> far from being dead. Yes, some of the devs take the lazy path of bundling crap, but it is an absolutely common knowledge in shareware circles that doing so will essentially kill your product, the goodwill and any hopes for any natural growth. It will also create problems with Google ranking and a headache with antivirus positives. With few exceptions only very desperate devs do that and typically only with throw away projects.<p>There are, of course, companies whose entire business model is based on scamming and scaremongering people, and generally treating them like a gray mass of idiots that always click on Next. But this has very little to do with the validity of the shareware model, and much more with simple &quot;get rich quick&quot; appeal of the bundleware.<p>The matter is not whether or not shareware model is dead.

No acquisition happened, they didn&#x27;t even bother to talk to us afterwards. We felt violated, unappreciated, insufficient.

That wasn&#x27;t how I perceived the process of making pop hits. \nRe: the Beatles today; of course they&#x27;d use the latest technology, but they might still have a hard time cutting through in a seven second listening session.

If you read &quot;The Emperor of All Maladies&quot; you&#x27;ll discover that a single research lab led by a (probably) fraudulent research lead caused the US healthcare system to spend around a $billion on an aggressive cancer treatment that was no more effective than the existing one back in the 90s. The treatment was extremely invasive and very expensive: the patient was pushed to the edge of organ failure by extremely high doses of chemotherapy which required close management by nursing staff and had to have a bone marrow transplant after the drug regimen was completed because their bone marrow didn&#x27;t survive. Needless to say, the side effects of this treatment were horrendous & since chemotherapy drugs are usually carcinogenic it&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed that people who received it that would otherwise have survived died later on as a consequence.<p>As far as I know the researcher in question has never faced any real sanction for their actions.

There&#x27;s lots of papers on how to do this for geometry intersection (i.e. packet tracing), and I think there&#x27;s a few slides from nvidia that give hints on how to do it for shading (avoid megakernels, sort all shading points by material id).<p>Brigade is a path tracer that is close to the real-time ideal (for outdoor scenes and using high-end GPUs), so looking into their code would certainly be interesting.",1421143433

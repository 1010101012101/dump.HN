It&#x27;s been a while, though.<p>My current site is a micro-site. I and my wife wrote the material. I hand-designed the layout, hand-coded all the html. As a programmer and a writer, I was pretty excited about the idea of microsites a few years ago. Here was a chance to combine my love of writing and programming to create online magazines around particular topics. I envisioned writing dedicated applications, doing some live updating of relevant information, and so on. It was (and is) a pretty cool idea: a spot between a blog and a dedicated topical site. As far as the guts of how the site works, using internal links, scoring highly on search terms, etc? Read that in an article somewhere. The goal is to create a small spider site around a topic such that people land on one page and see the top 3 or 4 related pages immediately, allowing them to browse tangentially if they&#x27;re in the wrong spot. There&#x27;s probably a better way to optimize around that than I did, but I never got around to it. And as far as Adsense, I added on ad unit to pay hosting costs. As I said, once I figured out why folks were visiting the idea was to get rid of it. But Google kept emailing and suggesting I bump it up to three units. Go figure.<p>And yep, Google killed me because everybody else in the microsite business used content farms, cranking out thousands of pages of crap, loading up with Adsense, flash ads, grabbing emails, and so on.<p>I still think the microsite idea is a great one, although, you are correct, anything that looks like one is going to get penalized. That&#x27;s a shame. There&#x27;s still a lot of potential there. Check out my microsite for books that hackers might like for an idea <a href=""http://hn-books.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn-books.com</a> (This is also a good example of a totally-static site that still has a database and lots of interactivity)<p>In either case, Google&#x27;s algorithm decided my couple of hundred hours of programming, design, and writing effort wasn&#x27;t worth it. After horsing around with the idea for a year, losing valuable time, I gave up. As somebody who was not out to game the system, I was collateral damage in the bigger war against crappy content.",1394614746

For example if you damage someone without violating the law, you cannot be punished for that (well, not legally).<p>It is also pretty obvious that if you violate a contract, but it has no consequences for anyone, you can&#x27;t be punished for this (this is a major difference between our -mostly- canon law and judaic or sharia law, where the state/everyone is responsible to punish you even if no one was bothered by your actions (the state in judaic law, everyone in sharia law, although muslim states are in the process of changing this, because despite allah&#x27;s &quot;wisdom&quot; the part of sharia where everybody should attack everyone they believe to have broken the law turns out to be massively counterproductive and destructive. There are many such changes, the one I like to remind muslim nutcases of is that sharia specifies the death penalty to any muslim not living under an islamic state (something they thoroughly implemented during the crusades for example), and there&#x27;s plenty of fatwas of this)<p>What the judge illustrated is that he judged that condition 2 was not satisfied in this case. There are lots of qualifications though. First, anyone who was damaged was reimbursed (A), not just for the price he would have paid, but on top of that for the resulting damages. I doubt you&#x27;d want to use this very often, as it does mean paying damages. Also : this is a very &quot;American&quot; judgement, and on the extreme side even for America.

I suppose people use loose for lose because they are unaware of the separate meaning and lose can have a long middle vowel, so we might end up with one word spelling: loose, meaning: lose.<p>Perhaps as a reaction people will start to emphasise the pronunciation difference and they&#x27;ll drift apart. NB that discussion of pronunciation does depend heavily on where you live - in one area the two might be clearly distinct, and in others almost indistinguishable.<p>Another example of a common error is the bizarre and illogical it&#x27;s and its, which I suspect will collapse to its at some point as people can&#x27;t be bothered with the distinction and the context usually makes it clear.<p>I loved this article because it pointed out that languages evolve mostly through mistakes or elisions which are common enough to become acceptable, and mistakes of 100 years ago become the accepted usage in future and enter the armoury of grammar pedants as indisputable truths.",1394613865

System management tools I would expect to call unlink(2) directly to remove the file, which doesn&#x27;t have a user-interface, rather than run rm.<p>However, the system management tool doesn&#x27;t start with no knowledge of the current state of the system, but rather one that is known (or otherwise discoverable/manageable).  And then attempt to transform the system into a target state.  They can not be expected to transform any random state into a target state.  As such, the result of unlink(2) should be reported, and the operator should have the option of fixing up the corner cases where it is unable to perform as desired.  If you&#x27;ve got 100 machines and 99 of them are able to be transformed into the target state by the system management tool and one of them is not, this isn&#x27;t a deficiency of the system management tool, but most likely a system having diverged in some way. Only the operator can decide if the divergence is something that can/should be handled on a continuous basis, by changing what the tool does (forcing removal of a file that is otherwise unable to be removed, for example), or fixing that system, after investigation.<p>The other option is to only ever start with a blank slate for each machine and built it from scratch into a known state.  If anything diverges, scrap it and start over.  This is an acceptable method of attack to keep systems from diverging, but not always the pragmatic one.",1394612894

Within a recipe, resources are applied in the order in which they are listed.<p>So it reads in a declarative fashion, but it doesn&#x27;t actually build a dependency graph (and a static representation of config) like Puppet does.<p>Anybody who&#x27;s done enough systems programming can put together something similar to Chef--it&#x27;s the same old imperative stuff everybody else has written, except with an idempotent sugar-coating and a client/server model to distribute the script^H^H^H^H^H^Hcookbooks. ;-)<p>I&#x27;m not putting chef down--the fact that it&#x27;s plain old ruby instead of a slightly-odd DSL is a definite advantage in some cases, but I don&#x27;t think that anything else out there is really in the same category as Puppet.<p>Of course, there are things about Puppet that bug me, but I really think that it&#x27;s the Right Thing at its core.

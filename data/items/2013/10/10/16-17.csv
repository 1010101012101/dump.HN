I bet our students will never hear of recursion on campus anymore.<p>From what I heard as a student assistant, there were all sorts of reasons for dropping Scheme. First, professors have to use half of their time for research, and there isn&#x27;t much useful research left in programming languages (given that the industry is decades behind that research, anyway). Second, many of our old professors started out in mathematics, unlike the new generation. Third, everything is being dumbed down. :(<p>At least my job is secure...",1381424376

I worked in a retail grocery store and was amazed at how low the margins were, shrjnkage and theft can really kill a business because of those small margins. I realised that I would never open such a business that depends on razor thin margins, but to your question, there are items that you will break even on or lose money such as bread, because you know that consumers will buy more goods.

6528732,comment,6527104,6527838,6,0,lmm,,,"Type system without even basic generics (even though the standard library needed them), never mind higher-level type constructs. Clunky special-casing of error-handling and concurrency, because the type system is not powerful enough to handle these in elegant ways. C-like simplicity but garbage collection makes it unsuitable for systems programming.<p>I think the popularity comes from a number of googlers using HN and upvoting related stories. A lot of go fans seem to be people for whom it&#x27;s their second language after python (or possibly their fourth language after python, java and c++ - the only languages that google employees are allowed to use, AIUI). So they see a language that&#x27;s more expressive than java, less crazy than C++, safer and more performant than python, and think it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread.<p>There are some good things in go. An opinionated formatter that ships with the language is a great idea. Static duck typing is an interesting idea, though IMO less useful than either alternative - it means you can&#x27;t do the equivalent of newtype, which is something you use <i>all the time</i> when coding in a properly typesafe language because it lets you catch so many errors. If you look at the scala community, there&#x27;s a syntax for doing this... and almost everyone&#x27;s agreed it&#x27;s a bad idea. The concurrency model is... worth pursuit and I&#x27;m glad someone&#x27;s trying it, though ultimately I think it will prove less practical than e.g. Erlang-style approaches.<p>It&#x27;s not the worst language ever. But it utterly fails to live up to the hype. I&#x27;ve yet to find anyone who likes it having previously done a serious project in Haskell/Scala/F#/OCaml.",1381424308

6528725,comment,6527104,6527316,1,0,mcgwiz,,,"The problem for me is not technical per se, but that it adds another element of complexity to an already complex programming environment and has implications for human resourcing.<p>Becoming expert in a new language goes beyond learning syntax; one must also learn code conventions/style, compiler/transpiler quirks, runtime quirks, and library/framework ecosystem. In CoffeeScript the last two may be moot, but the first two remain. Additionally, to be an expert in a transpiled language, one must be an expert in the target language. It is much harder to find someone that has this knowledge and experience in both CoffeeScript and JavaScript.<p>This begs the question of each web dev team: if you are already experts in JavaScript, is the value-add from the transpiled language worth the cost of increased solution complexity/cognitive load, and smaller talent pool? My take is that CoffeeScript doesn&#x27;t meet that bar for most teams.<p>For individual projects, or isolated one-off tools, these non-technical issues are moot. Also, server-side may be less of an issue since complexity is reduced by not having to write for multiple runtimes (only Node.js and usually without DOM).",1381424251

Poverty/wealth is, on the whole, a consequence of chosen behavior.<p>That&#x27;s not an &quot;observation&quot;, its a <i>claim</i>. Actually, its two <i>separate</i> claims: one a claimed effect of a hypothetical action, and one a claimed mechanism of the claimed effect.<p>And while I see plenty of reason to suspect that the claimed <i>effect</i> would be true if a point-in-time redistribution occurred, the evidence from, oh, <i>looking around at places that have different observed distributions of wealth and what factors correlate with them</i> is that its not because degree of poverty and wealth are consequences of chosen behavior of individuals, but because the distribution of wealth toward which a society tends are determined largely by the policies (tax, social support, etc.) present in the society on an ongoing basis, such that a point in time redistribution will, over time, be eroded back to the distribution favored by policy (it might, actually, remix <i>who</i> is where on the distribution, but not what the actual distribution looks like over the long term.)",1381424084

6528625,comment,6527230,6528320,5,0,aaronem,,,"> (Contrary to what you occasionally see online, it&#x27;s still damn near impossible to publish bullshit in Nature or Science.)<p>Ahem: &quot;An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome&quot; [1], published in <i>Nature</i> (they published in <i>Science</i> too but I don&#x27;t have the cite handy) -- masterfully demolished [2] by Graur et al.<p>You might say that the ENCODE paper&#x27;s authors &quot;are guilty of framing their results in the most arresting manner possible&quot;. You might also say, inflammatory as it would probably be, that their results are &quot;bullshit&quot;; Graur et al. certainly seem to have taken that view, if not in such earthy fashion, and they did an excellent job of demonstrating in exhaustive detail exactly why that&#x27;s so. (If you&#x27;re at all familiar with the ENCODE work, but haven&#x27;t read &quot;On the Immortality of Television Sets&quot;, I strongly recommend you do so -- and that goes double if you&#x27;ve seen the reams of garbage in the popular science press about &quot;the death of junk DNA&quot;.)<p>Climate science, of course, is a much more generally contentious field than bioinformatics, and much political power attaches to it; one does not, after all, often find governments writing policy on the basis of a bioinformatics consortium&#x27;s latest recommendations, while such behavior is the status quo in climate science. Were that otherwise, one wonders whether Graur and his co-authors would&#x27;ve found themselves unable to publish in GB&E or any recognized journal, and had to resort to doing so on a website of their own. Perhaps they could name it &quot;Genomics Audit&quot;.<p>As for laymen such as myself, a mere software engineer without a day&#x27;s worth of tertiary education to his name, well -- all I can say is that, while evaluating the evidence for and against AGW (climate change, whatever) and developing an informed opinion of any sort requires enormous intelligence and domain knowledge, spotting propaganda does not, and neither does mistrusting propaganda once spotted.<p>Your comment here verges upon an argument that propaganda is only evil when unvirtuously engaged in; that is, that the ends justify the means. I suggest that fallacy inheres within this line of reasoning, and that even a superficial review of the history of the 20th century suffices as demonstration. Perhaps you disagree.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11247.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature1...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.e...</a>",1381423251

A lot of Java practice has built up around having behavior determined dynamically (OOP is a nice fit for that, whereas C does not have great facilities for it). Much of the &quot;ceremony&quot; involved in using the big, complex Java frameworks is about preparing a piece of code for eventual extension. When some behavior is hard-coded in, it&#x27;s difficult to change later, so the code is parameterized over anything and everything that might eventually change. Of course this looks silly when you do it for small things that won&#x27;t change -- no need for FizzStrategy and BuzzStrategy interfaces when the only thing you&#x27;d ever want to do is print &quot;fizz&quot; or &quot;buzz&quot;.<p>Quite a bit of that programming practice did develop in C++, but Java as a language provides stronger safety guarantees than C++ (lots of memory-related errors are difficult to impossible to have in Java) without sacrificing all that much performance. When you ask for a reasonably performant, statically-typed, memory-safe, object-oriented language, you&#x27;re going to get pointed at Java (and C#).

As the author points out, Amazon is good at what they do; maybe too good.<p>If you&#x27;re a small e-com retailer, selling your goods on Amazon can seem like the magic bullet you&#x27;ve been looking for. They can provide you a huge audience overnight. And if you have a good product at the right price, you&#x27;re probably going to do well on Amazon. The danger is when you do well enough that Amazon takes notice, because if you&#x27;re little slice of the industry starts to look too profitable, Amazon will come in and start selling in your category direct. And they&#x27;re bigger than you and can do it on a smaller margin. Entire verticals can be consumed in a matter of weeks if Amazon decides to set up shop next to you. Amazon is really good at destroying the retailers that they helped in the beginning.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Once Amazon squeezes out the small players, they start acting like Walmart with the manufacturers. They start dictating margins and pushing down prices. And they can do it because they&#x27;ve monopolized the distribution channel. Amazon isn&#x27;t making a lot of friends with manufacturers lately.<p>My point is that while this may be a clear win for consumers, it&#x27;s a very sticky situation for manufacturers, distributors and retailers. If you go to most of the major e-commerce trade shows, you&#x27;ll find that people are actually quite fearful of Amazon. They&#x27;re looking for ways to widen the gap, not close it. Heck, in the past year I&#x27;ve actually started to get contractual obligations from some major manufacturers that I CAN&#x27;T sell on Amazon. They&#x27;re mandating that all of their retailers keep their product off of there because they&#x27;re scared shitless that it&#x27;s just a matter of time before Bezos starts dictating their margins.<p>For better or worse, I do think Amazon will be successful to some degree with this project, but there&#x27;s going to be a lot of behind the scenes fighting to get there.",1381421350

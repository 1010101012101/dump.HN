Only tuned to be more precise, easier to click / press and overall more accurate.<p>With that said, I agree with the author in that I enjoy buttons on my controllers. I need to physically press something. Playing SMB, for example, on a touch screen just doesn&#x27;t feel right. I&#x27;m also worried about how pressing multiple buttons on the same touchpad is going to work. Are the diagonals going to act as a combo-press?",1380383976
6462103,comment,6461860,6462086,1,0,kcorbitt,,,"From what I remember of my rusty high school chemistry magnetism requires a certain relatively stable configuration of the valence electrons.  I&#x27;m guessing that as temperature increases it&#x27;s impossible for the atoms (or even just the electrons) to maintain that configuration because of the increased energy.  The electrons might even get excited enough to jump to entirely different orbitals, but I&#x27;m not sure if it works that way.",1380383972

I see several claims about how much better the code is with TDD. Well, can I see examples? I write tests, but I don&#x27;t do TDD. By and large, I am proud of my code; I think you could design things differently, but rarely better. I spent 17 years doing this for the military, more for cancer research, where results and bugs matter, and I strongly believe (absent proof, I didn&#x27;t do it with TDD after all) that my solutions were near optimal in terms of resources used. Meaning, how long it took me to make the bug free code, how understandable and modifiable the code was, and how defect free it was.<p>So, where is the code that will blow my socks off? May I see some? I recognize that is a difficult challenge to answer explicitly; I&#x27;m not <i>really</i> asking for a github link or whatever.

6462043,comment,6461581,6461899,4,0,RogerL,,,"Read the literature. Kent Beck, the author of the idea and the book describing it, very clearly argues for test first. The test tells you how to design. I&#x27;m not sure if that is what you mean by your paragraph or not. But in his book, the test is always written first, and it guides you into how you should write your code.<p>I found it extremely dubious. He was doing some kind of accounting/banking app, and came up with a new approach. Well, he spent his career on this domain. I find it far less likely that TDD caused the new idea than it was just that he&#x27;d hoed this row so many times before. If you have done it 10 times before you can do bottom up, top down, inside out, outside in, or completely random, and get a reasonably structured, working code base.

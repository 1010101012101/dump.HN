However, it is absurd to think that regulation necessarily solves market failures.<p>> The Clean Air Act, for example, has been extremely successful at addressing the negative externalities created by air pollution.<p>It's always interesting when an economic argument ignores either costs or benefits.  While the clean air act provided benefits, that doesn't imply that we couldn't have gotten the benefits for less, let alone that every regulation in the face of claimed ""market failure"", or even actual externalities, is a good idea.<p>> So why shout ""laissez faire"" to a government initiative addressing such a market failure?<p>Because ""government initiative"" doesn't necessarily work.  In fact, it tends to fail wrt R&D.  Yes, the small projects, especially those run by DoD, do well.  (I'll note that even that hasn't been all that good recently.)  However, the big projects, especially those influenced by VCs, tend to be disasters, especially lately.  Since this is one of the latter....",1323539950

Translating UTF-8 to fixed-width UTF-32 and back is of linear complexity and takes small, fixed amount of memory. The only trade-off is when processing /very/ long lines -- up to four time more memory would be used for buffer.<p>As mentioned in other posts, Unicode requires normalization of certain character combinations into other characters, so you'll be processing all input characters anyway. Just prefix an extra step to it, not even a separate loop.<p>And so you can do Boyer-Moore with Unicode at very little extra cost :-)<p>Some text-intensive programs of Plan 9, including grep,  use internally fixed-widht format called `Rune' for unicode, exactly for reasons of performance. UTF-8 input is translated into strings of Runes for processing and translated back for output.",1323539457

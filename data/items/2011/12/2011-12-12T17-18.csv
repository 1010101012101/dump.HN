3344265,comment,3343475,3343992,17,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Analyzing fiction is a guessing game at best, and a completely naive, amateur attempt to perform psychoanalysis on dead authors at worst.""</i><p>Actually, one of the cardinal rules of literary criticism is that you should <i>not</i> attempt to psychoanalyze the author of a work; rather, you should treat the work as a self-contained unit. If you're going to analyze the author, then it's an entirely different task. Blending the two bastardizes both efforts. So yes, I would agree that bad criticism tends to employ such efforts. But I would also argue that no literature professor worth his tenure should even be proposing such methods in a classroom.<p>I do agree that trying to discern intent is a ""guessing game."" But some ways of guessing are much more effective than others. And some guesses are more sound than others.<p>While I sympathize with much of what you're saying, I think you give short shrift to the field of literary criticism and analysis. There's some genuinely insightful, analytical, occasionally profound stuff out there.<p><i>""My method of analysis was to approach stories from a rational standpoint...""</i><p>What do you mean by this? ""Rational"" in what sense? Are you studying the rationality of the text? Are you proposing a set of logical guidelines to be used in evaluating a text? Are you focusing on the internal coherence and consistencies of the world within the story? Are you focused on the story's structural soundness? ""Rational"" is a pretty big and broad word that begs clarification. As you can see, I just generated a handful of different ways of interpreting your statement. This would seem to indicate that the statement needs further clarification.<p>Now, the real problem with this is that you're suggesting that your approach was ""rational,"" and implying that other approaches are irrational. Such a claim demands explication.<p><i>""...the problem with fiction is that the stories exist in a realm without rules (or incomplete rules, in the best case scenario).""</i><p>Again, this is pretty vague. What do you mean by ""rules?"" And are the ""rules"" you're proposing in any way tainted by your own subjectivity? It's very, very, very tricky to define sets of rules for fiction. By and large, we're still pretty much working with the set that the Greeks came up with a couple thousand years ago.<p>I don't mean to knock you or your post, because I think I understand what you're saying. But if you're going to attack a system, you need to be very clear about a) what's wrong with the system, and b) what your alternatives entail.",1323712597

Medicaid is especially interesting because the vast majority of the ""poor uninsured"" are eligible and get signed up as soon as they actually need care.<p>Both programs are fairly well publicized, so it's interesting that you mentioned emergency care as if it's the only option.<p>And there's a third option which is less well known.

3344261,comment,3342194,3343015,4,0,wpietri,,,"I have never suggested natural differences don't exist.<p>I'm suggesting that a) using the idea of them without evidence to justify apparently unfair outcomes is bullshit, b) historically people making those arguments have often been spectacularly wrong, and c) people who make that argument when it's personally convenient are perhaps fooling themselves.<p>You're also rampantly committing the naturalistic fallacy. What's natural tells us nothing about what's right. Even if we have made a perfectly fair society (which we certainly haven't) and discover that there is some difference in outcomes that is explainable by genetic differences, that doesn't mean we should accept the result.<p>If some people are genetically likely to be less good at math, should we cancel their math classes? Or should we give them better ones? I say the latter: as a society we want people to understand and appreciate math.<p>If some group of people is more prone to a disease, do we go with what's natural? Or do we work against it? Consider heart disease for African Americans, or skin cancer for white people. As one of the naturally pale, I appreciate having sunblock available, and cultural reminders to put it on or cover up. And if I do get skin cancer, I'd rather be treated instead of being told it's ""natural"" for me to die of it.<p>I've also heard it argued that psychopaths make ""natural"" CEOs, and that we should therefore accept their various depredations. That ignores that CEO isn't some sort of ecological niche; it's an artificial, societally-constructed position. We may have reason to want CEOs to be more responsible than average rather than less, no matter what's ""natural"" in this context. And we may have reason to want startups being created by a broader collection of people than those who might ""naturally"" most incline (after a lifetime of unnatural conditioning) to play the entirely artificial game we've set up for them.",1323712469

3344252,comment,3343868,3344215,4,0,cryptoz,,,"> Many apps in the app store violate these requirements.<p>Ah. So the problem is that someone may act illegally? That's always been the case, since the dawn of time. If you're going to develop some open source software, of course there is a risk to you that someone may copy it and not follow the license. But there's significantly greater risk to the person copying, correct? If it's a crime (is it?) they risk having a criminal record and all that.<p>So, there's nothing new here, no new risks that open source developers haven't been facing since always, and nothing at all unique about this situation. In fact, it's probably a lot better now since you have a single source to contact (the app store owner) to let them know there is a TOS violation and illegal content on their site. In previous times, there may have been no recourse (say, the copier has hosted the content on a Russian domain; you've got nowhere to turn).<p>All in all, it seems the situation for open source developers is significantly better than it ever has been regarding illegal copying of their software.",1323712368

If you were to use it for recognition rather than memorization (and wanted fewer words to remember) you would have to manually decide where to truncate the hash before converting it. If you wanted to pick a specific wordlist, you could do that.<p>I originally came up with this as a system for helping to memorize IPv6 addresses; it also works as a system for passphrase generation (first generate a random number with the desired number of bits of entropy, then convert to words.)",1323711369

Whenever you can bound the number of iterations in an algorithm as a computable function of the arguments, you can implement the algorithm by computing the upper bound and iterating that many times with an iterator function that acts like the identity once it reaches its base case (for mod, the case is x < n).<p>The range implementation displays another important method called 'tupling' or more generally 'strengthening the induction hypothesis'. It underlies the predecessor/decrement function for Church numerals which the author of the article presents but chooses not to explain; the idea is simple, if rather inspired. Rather than iteratively compute n-1 as a function of n, we will compute a more general datum, the pair (n-1, n). That might seem like a pointless change, but when formulated this way, the problem becomes surprisingly easy:<p><pre><code>    dec n = fst (iterate n (\\(_, x) -> (x, x+1)) (0, 0))</code></pre>",1323709859

Despite a blanket dismissal of algorithms in general, Carr is of course taking issue with companies like Google. Ignoring that truth-judgement over a body of data as diverse as the web is going to be a very, very tricky problem for computers and humans... is the Google search engine's only directive to find ""truth""? Ideally, the top search results contain the truth, but Google makes a philosophical judgment that other factors (such as link popularity and location) need to be considered when retrieving the most <i>relevant</i> results...because relevance is easier and safer to judge than <i>truth</i>.<p>In the same vein, the New York Times would like to say that the advertisements they run all contain truth.

3344063,comment,3343664,3343958,1,0,flatline,,,"From my experience working in smaller companies just beyond the startup phase, if the person caught on quick and was able to contribute, even if their contributions had a lot of issues, that was still valuable work.  Some people would, however, just get stuck and never seemed to know what to do or what was expected of them, which doesn't work well in a small group but is much more acceptable at a large corporate internship.  It goes back to the author's point on who to hire, but my impression is that this is a bigger problem with students who don't have much actual work experience. Work, especially in a startup, is much different than school, where you are shooting for a fairly well-defined goal, work is doled out in carefully measured chunks, and you can often just show up and get your grade if that's your motivation.  The point that struck me in this was your 3-4 year figure; I would expect someone to hit the ground running, or at least moving at a steady pace, even if they ran into a few walls along the way.<p>I didn't really address your question directly, many startup founders are at this same point in their lives, I would be curious to hear from people with direct experience hiring interns in the startup scene.",1323709472

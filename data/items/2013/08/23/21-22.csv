Some python hackers find it too big with too much bloated features. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, anytime I start with a smaller web-framework I need to add mostly all django functionaly the next few days so meh.<p>IMHO, for new projects, DJango is clearly one of the top contestant.",1377295162
6266481,comment,6265506,6265506,4,0,afreak,,,"There are two organisations that I fear:<p>- Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)<p>- Department of Fisheries and Oceans (long story)<p>I do not fear CSIS, the RCMP, or the CSE oddly.<p>The CRA (like the IRS) will make your life a living hell if you do not file properly. I was once a member of a not-for-profit organisation that was shutdown by the CRA due to the incompetence of its treasurer. The treasurer refused to file on a yearly basis under the guise that it wasn&#x27;t necessary. It was difficult to remove the person as it was a three-person body that ran the NFP company with a directors board underneath to handle all other affairs--I had several years in the directors board.<p>Looking back it was a dumb structure but it made sense at the time at least.<p>Eventually the CRA got wind of our not-filing due to our status as a corporation under the Business Corporations Act in British Columbia, and thus seized all assets and shut it down. It recently rebirthed as a non-profit organisation (with people who do know what the hell they&#x27;re doing), but it left a good friend of mine almost in a compromised financial state, another person unable to get a business of their own due to disqualification from tax credits, and another person (the treasurer themselves) ended up going AWOL.<p>Don&#x27;t fuck with the government body that wants your tax dollars even if you don&#x27;t have to do anything more than fill out a one-page form.",1377295127

Being responsible with the NSA information makes sense since the NSA was his employer and at one time may have represented the welfare of his fellow citizens, but all the information from the other of the 5 Eyes I imagine he, Glenn and Laura could be much more liberal with the reporting. I&#x27;m sure there are downsides to such a tactic, but it seems that at the very least it would make all the rest of the 5 Eyes look bad enough that those other nations in the future would be a lot more conservative with respect to how much they cooperate with the NSA. At the end of the day, only the US and the UK have been actual terror targets.

MS is only broken according to engineers inside and people in the SV echochamber.  They&#x27;ve got piles of cash,  they generate piles of cash, they pay a dividend... Other than equity prices, they look pretty good.  They were late to search but bing has carved out a niche,  late to mobile but they&#x27;ve got a niche, late to games but they look like they are doing just fine there.  Vista, Windows 8, RT and Surface seem to be missteps but they are still shipping numbers that most companies would be envious of.<p>If they were or are bothered by the flat equity prices, why did it take so long?  And to be very honest, the engineers I&#x27;ve spoke to that have mentioned &quot;problems&quot; within the company generally have options that have been underwater, FWIW.<p>I think Ballmer and upper management think they are doing just fine, they think there is a competitive landscape but they are still making tons of money and leading a few sectors.  He reorged them for what he sees as the next 10 years or something and he&#x27;s going to find a replacement that sees his vision.

However, I believe there are key differences at this point in Medium&#x27;s evolution (I do believe they will change their model over time).<p>For me, thinking writing an article, Medium offers the following: a possible readership/distribution (assuming I get picked up by editors), no long term commitments, no investment in set up (as opposed to a hosted personal blog), and little friction in posting.<p>As an idea, having a streamlined essay posting & sharing process seems good, however I think that Medium will need to address the following issues going forward:<p>* Serious authors will eventually want to build their own identity/brand. I think much of posts in HN that criticise Medium comes down to this issue. When you write for Medium, you almost seem to detach yourself from the work. YouTube addresses this problem by offering channels with revenue sharing. This means that the amount of time required to publish a piece of quality output for free can be justified to some degree. For Medium though, I see this limitation as restricting its content to be published by those that do not intent to write regularly and do not already have an outlet for their writing.<p>* Dealing with signal vs noise. Assuming the above is not addressed, and Medium continues to be a place where semi-serious, or novice, authors essentially practice their craft, then there will be a lot of crap for people to sift through in order to read some content that appeals to them. If Medium editors are tasked with this job, that in itself would be a manual process that would be difficult to scale.<p>* Curating content when authors have no commitments. When people write a blog, it needs a title, which will usually indicate what the general topic of the blog is about. Although authors can deviate from time to time, I find most successful blogs are generally on-topic as the author develops expertise both in the area of interest and in his/her ability to communicate their ideas surround the topic. However, on Medium, this commitment is no longer required. You can sign in, write, and your output is only loosely linked to you as an author. This means that there is no simple predictor of content category and quality.<p>Personally, I would very much like to see a platform where people can post, be read, and ideally get some compensation for their writing if they can find an audience; basically YouTube for writers as the article states. However, I think Medium is still a fair way away from that model at this point.",1377293372

That&#x27;s more chaos than quantum.<p>Here&#x27;s a bit from my own research.  I start with a neutron whose spin is pointed up.  I then use magnets to bend the neutron&#x27;s trajectory depending on whether it&#x27;s spinning to the left or the right.  Since the spinning in the up state is a linear combination of spinning in the left or right states, it just so happens that I don&#x27;t know whether the neutron bends to the left or the right.<p>For most of the neutrons, that&#x27;s all I do.  Another set of magnets pulls the beams back together.  They get to the end of the instrument and I measure whether they&#x27;re spinning up.  Since I haven&#x27;t done anything besides split the beam, they&#x27;re all still spinning up.<p>However, for a small fraction of the neutrons, I measure which way they bent.  I know know whether it is spinning left or spinning right.  Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s spinning left.  Well, just as spinning up is a linear combination of spinning left and right, spinning left is a linear combination of spinning up and down.  Since I know that the beam is spinning left, I no longer know whether it&#x27;s spinning up or down.  When I measure this neutron at the end of the instrument, it only has a fifty percent chance of pointing up.<p>This isn&#x27;t a couple of photons hitting a particle and changing the velocity slightly.  I&#x27;ve gone from all of my neutrons pointing up to only half of them pointing up.<p>You might immediately assume that the problem is that I did something to the neutron when I measured whether it was pointing left or right.  The &quot;spooky&quot; thing about this is that I didn&#x27;t do a single thing to that neutron to measure which way it was spinning.  The way I perform the measurement is that, after I split the neutron beam, I put a wall in one of the beams.  The other path, however, is just the same as it was before.  I haven&#x27;t touched any of these neutrons.  Each of these neutrons goes through the exact same fields and paths as they did in the experiment where all the neutrons were pointed up, except no half of them are pointed down.<p>Quantum mechanics doesn&#x27;t just say that you have to touch something to measure it and that will effect the outcome.  It says that performing a measurement will effect the outcome, even if you don&#x27;t touch it.  That&#x27;s where some people get spooked.<p>----\nTo preemptively answer a couple of questions:\n1) No, you can&#x27;t use magnets to bend neutron beams based on the Lorentz force.  However, the neutron does have a magnetic moment which produces a potential with a magnetic field.  This leads to an index of refraction change that causes a slight angular splitting of the neutron beam.  Nothing ever gets separated by more than a micron.<p>2) No, I don&#x27;t really put in a wall to measure just the left spinning neutrons.  There&#x27;s a solid material whose density fluctuations over the micro length scale serve as my effective wall.  Thus, I don&#x27;t actually get half the neutrons flipping at the end of the experiment, but rather a fraction proportional to how much information I get about the left right spin from my single wall.",1377291894

Anarchist versus authoritarian is a spectrum, depending on how much you believe government is necessary to prevent negative social activity. Most liberals and most conservatives are pretty far on the authoritarian side of the scale. E.g. a liberal might think government is necessary to prevent racial discrimination, and a conservative might think government is necessary to prevent deviant sexual behavior. In contrast traditional libertarians are somewhere in the middle. They believe the government is necessary to prevent things like classic property rights, but not say gender discrimination. Anarcho-libertarians mostly reject the use of government to protect even things like classic property rights.<p>Sunstein endorses using the government to do things like increase the amount and diversity of political discussion in society, or decreasing how much people buy fast food and soda, which is pretty far on the authoritarian side of things.<p>It&#x27;s not an inherently pejorative label.

It&#x27;s great at showing what happened, but has no clue about why.<p>To name one example, they address the question of education by showing correlations between college degrees and income. What this is missing of course is any change <i>within</i> college degrees themselves. What are students studying? What is the quality of their work? How well does it match up with what employers need?<p>I don&#x27;t have the numbers in front of me, but I believe if you drill down, you find that some college degrees (like electrical engineering) have kept up very well with productivity and wage growth. Others, like anthropology, have not.<p>I will tell you that I live in one of the most educated regions in the nation (DC area), and it is extremely difficult for technology businesses to hire people with the right skills. If you are a good programmer or sysadmin, you can make a lot of money here tomorrow. But a bachelors in political science is not, by itself, going to get you much.",1377291699

What has happened in Brazil is far more complex than what you can see happening from outside.<p>In fact, Brazil is surprisingly well-insulated from the rest of the world economically. After many years of horrible financial crisis, it&#x27;s adopted very conservative and heavily regulated banking practices. It&#x27;s got an astronomically high risk-free rate making the cost of capital high enough to discourage reckless borrowing domestically. Even borrowing cheap money internationally was shown to be risky after the exchange rates changed sharply around 2000 causing the &quot;rphos do cambio&quot;. Most economic success has been captured by those with access to cheap money through family and friends. Our &quot;Rockefellers&quot; and &quot;Mellons&quot; got a lot richer because they had access to enough cheap capital to go after opportunities that few others could meaning that there was little to no competition in many major industries. The Bolsa Familiar did a lot to stimulate economic activity that more equitably spread across the society (it&#x27;s an interesting analog to the notion of a universal livable wage and the rest of the World should take some time to study it&#x27;s impact at both the macro and microeconomic level&quot;. We&#x27;re also fairly well insulated trade wise from the rest of the world by our own incompetence at the governmental level. Brazil has been remarkably short-sized when it comes to essential infrastructure. Most big projects are poorly planned if at all. We lack decent shipping infrastructure internally and our ports and airports leave a lot to be desired. We could probably have done even better if we actually had the infrastructure internally to move more of our natural resources abroad.<p>All in all, Brazil in the last 20 years is a country capitalizing on a lot of its potential that it couldn&#x27;t capitalize on prior to the Plano Real. All the external trade like iron ore and agriculture largely served as a buffers from instabilities as we developed lots of industries internally.",1377291627

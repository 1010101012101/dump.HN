1383578,comment,1383376,1383376,0,0,stevenbrianhall,,,"Have you ever considered investing in an organization that specializes in micro-finance? The potential to do good and impact impoverished people with even a small portion of your recent earnings (congrats, by the way!) is incredible.<p>A high-level summary of micro-finance is the issuing of small loans (often just $100-$200) to small groups of 3-4 extremely poor people. The borrower then uses that previously unattainable capital to purchase supplies and equipment to open their own business.<p>A classic example would be a poor woman in rural Mexico. Her husband works in the fields and they make just barely enough to get by and feed their kids, there's no capital left over even in a good season, and therefore no way to get ahead. If someone were to offer her the opportunity for a micro-loan, she would have a chance to overcome that barrier of extreme poverty.<p>The lender of the micro-loan would have the woman find another two or three of her friends, and they would form a borrowing group. The borrowing group puts together their aggregate financial needs, and a loan is issued to the group. The purpose of the group is accountability and camaraderie, and receiving additional loans is contingent on every member paying back their loan on time The group will meet together once a week with the lender and pay back a small portion of their loan plus interest over the course of 6 to 8 months.<p>Upon receiving the loan, the woman would buy a large pot, supplies, ingredients, and a table, and begin making and selling tamales out of the front of her house. She'd make enough to cover her own living expenses and pay off the weekly loan repayment amounts, while improving her own quality of life and gaining confidence.<p>This extends credit to people who would have never qualified under the existing banking system, and I have story upon story of people's lives who were absolutely changed by what we would consider an absolutely trivial amount.<p>I don't do this for a living, but I firmly believe in it, and will be putting that belief into practice within the next year.<p>Some micro-finance organizations include:\n1. Grameen Bank - <a href=""http://www.grameen-info.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameen-info.org/</a>\n2. Kiva - <a href=""http://kiva.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kiva.org</a> (started by PayPal alums)\n3.

1383546,comment,1383410,1383410,0,0,DrSprout,,,">In a 2001 study, two scholars in Canada asked 70 people to read “The Demon Lover,” a short story by Elizabeth Bowen. One group read it in a traditional linear-text format; they’d read a passage and click the word next to move ahead. A second group read a version in which they had to click on highlighted words in the text to move ahead. It took the hypertext readers longer to read the document, and they were seven times more likely to say they found it confusing.<p>In other words, if you mangle a short-story and push it into a different format from the one it was written in, it's harder to read. That has nothing to do with hypertext.<p>>She found that comprehension declined as the number of links increased—whether or not people clicked on them. After all, whenever a link appears, your brain has to at least make the choice not to click, which is itself distracting.<p>That's more a question of wordiness than of hypertext. Whether and where to link is a very important decision in modern composition, probably more important than word choice.<p>Basically, these studies are assuming that all content is created equal, and that's far from the case. I would say it's more a question of poor web design shattering focus - that said, much of the web is designed with the intent of shattering focus.",1274968062
1383545,comment,1383376,1383376,0,0,vessenes,,,"First, congratulations!<p>Now, to business.. If you sold company stock, and live in the states, you now owe about $1m in taxes, or a little less depending on what state you live in.<p>Your very first job is to sit down with an accountant and get your 2010 taxes estimated. Then set aside the money for this. Seriously, do it today. Then lock in your head ""I sold my company for $4m."" It will help you in the future days to remember that.<p>If it was an asset sale, you got f-ed, and now owe a lot of tax money. Live and learn.<p>Next, let's talk about 'more money than I can ever spend'. If you keep your current spending rates, and you keep your money in a completely 'safe' vehicle that exactly matches inflation, you have about 94 years of spending ahead of you at your current rates, and at 15% cap gains tax on the 'earnings'.<p>It is nearly psychologically impossible for a newly minted 20-something millionaire to keep at their current level of spending. Since you do not already have a plan for this money, I would say that it is 100% likely you are not the sort who can go about his business without some change in lifestyle. So I would suggest that you expect either to keep working or get good at investing.<p>Along with the books recommended here, I would strongly recommend you pick up one called ""How To Retire Early and Live Well on Less than a Million Dollars."" It's written by a financial writer who decided to do what the title says in the 1970s. He talks through a number of items and considerations that financial advisors will not think about. Simple example: what's the proper amount of real estate leverage for someone who needs some income, and wants to be able to hold on to the building in a real estate crash? This is not typically discussed in most investing books.<p>It is not unreasonable, based on all this, to put almost all of this money into a one year, low-risk, locked-away investment just to give yourself time to think, plan,and get on with a new part of your life.<p>Now, if you built this company up, and are now unemployed, expect to be depressed. You should consider (along with some celebrating) doing some fun things (I like to travel), and also learning some new skills.<p>You will need some new friends, because your old ones will all still be working,and won't be able to hang out most of the time. You might want to find a new hobby, or pick up an old one.<p>Finally, enjoy! Sounds like a great experience.",1274968061

Here's mine:<p>At 21 I came into a pretty useful 6 figure sum, essentially through good luck and timing. At that age you're used to living on a shoe string (especially if a student like I was) and so that can seem an extraordinary amount of money. I'd say it's a pretty scary age to become affluent, you may have grown up in the last couple of years since leaving school but it hardly counts as worldly.<p>I spent about £30,000 within a couple of months before I stopped and thought about it properly. So the first piece of advice is: <i>avoid too much temptation</i>! That can be hard and I still have trouble controlling impulse purchases (Amazon Prime is the worst invention ever :P my book buying budget is still about £300/month, and I've actually worked to get that down).<p>As to what to do with the money; while plenty of HNers will be able to give you advice (hopefully from experience!) the other posters are right - <i>you need to talk to a financial advisor</i>.<p>My take? Put it somewhere safe and take the interest - then just ignore it. If you want to take the $5M and do something with it (i.e. start a firm, pursue your dream) then do that. Otherwise I advise ignoring it and just carrying on with your career how you want - albeit slightly more comfortable/financially secure. In 5 years when you want a nice house the money is there and ready. etc etc.<p>Certainly having money is going to change you; but I'd suggest it needn't change your life path too much.

I think people are willing to pay when they're in a time of need, but most of the time, it's hard to see the value of paying for a service that's there as a ""someday I'll need this, maybe"" service. Note that job boards (the flipside of this app) charge for specific job listings ... companies don't generally pay for a ""retainer"" service that they can then post to when they have a need ... they pay a per-job fee. Maybe an annual subscription would work, but, again, communicating the value would be important.<p>Keep in mind, of course, that HN might not be the best place to do market research on this, as few people here are interested in keeping a resume and applying to work for someone else.

The world needs to sound the warning bell and get everything tested and cutover to IPv6 before we have major systems malfunctioning.<p>Imagine what would happen to the world's financial markets, in a tough time like we have today, when the systems we rely upon start failing because they need IPv6.<p>I also predict that pretty soon, you'll start to see a massive hiring cycle for IT workers as they are brought back into the workplace to convert and test everything for IPv6.<p>(Might also be a good time to buy gold?)",1274967519

1383433,story,,,5,2,jasonlotito,"Ask HN: Website Idea, Online resumes done right",,"tl;dr: Your online resume.<p>Backstory: August of last year, after a year and a half from my last startup closing down, I decided it was time to get back to work.  The time had been spent with my family, and watching my son in his first year.  It was a good time.  But getting back to work would mean getting a job, and at the time, I was more concerned about a solid pay check.  Obviously, in this economic climate, it was a bit scary, but I had ample experience and was confident I could land a job.  I went to work.  I had to create a resume, and then get it up online.  I bought the domain name, and put it up there.  Spent quite a bit of time getting it right.  In the end, this is what allow my current employer to find me.  A search on Google came up with my resume as the first result, provided the proper contact information, and made it easy for them to get in contact with me.  After interviews and negotiations, I got the job.<p>My brother is in a situation like this as well.  He's part of the inspiration for this project.  The idea is that I had to spend time putting together the website, the design, even as simple as it was, and making sure it got up on the search engines.  None of this was difficult for me to do, but for someone like my brother, he doesn't even realize it's something he should do.  A resume on Monster.com isn't geared toward the masses and SEO.  It's geared toward Monster.com searching.<p>Since leaving school, I've gotten all my jobs because someone knew me somehow and recommended me in some capacity.  Of those, 3 of them also included what I did online.  One, in fact, included me walking into the interview with a stack an inch thick of what the interviewer had found online about me.<p>The reality is, most people get jobs through word of mouth.  Someone knows someone, or their is some common ground.  At least the good jobs.<p>So, the idea for the site is bred from some simple ideas:<p>1. It's good to have a website dedicated to your resume.  To promoting yourself.  You want a search result with your name to return your resume, your own personal advertisement, rather than some random Facebook page.<p>2. You want to always be promoting yourself.  The job market has changed, and you want to be out there.  If someone is interested in searching for you, you don't want them to have to go searching for more information.  You want that information to be easily found.<p>3. Most people don't have the time or energy to invest in creating an highly optimized online resume.  Couple this with the cost of having to buy hosting, and the price can get a bit high just for a place to put an online resume.<p>4. People need jobs.  In the current market, job hunting has become even more important.  People are becoming aware that it's important to always be prepared to find a job.  If you aren't actively pursuing a better job, you're hurting yourself.<p>5. For far too long, job hunting has been employer-centric.  Advertise a job, receive resumes.  People are coming to accept that advertising their own skills is becoming important.  Social networks are, in a way, teaching people to put their lives online in an orderly fashion; a personal resume.<p>6. Employers focus too much on accepting resumes instead of getting what they want.  It's difficult for employers to find people with the skills they need on their own, without going through an agency.  Even then, it's still focused on hiring unemployed people or people that are actively looking.<p>These are pretty broad ideas, but rather simple.  They describe the problems, the issues at hand.  The service seeks to solve these problems in various ways, to service not only the potential employees, but the employers as well.<p>1. Simple to use.  The site is focused on providing an efficient, professional resume.  You fill in the blanks.  The goal is to be fast, painless, and get up something good, quick.<p>2. The service is meant to be long term.  Year-long terms here.  The idea goal is for the resume to be a ""living resume.""  It updates itself, or you update it, with the current status.  It's smart.  A year goes by, and 5 years of experience becomes 6, for example.  You are encouraged to update.<p>3. Everything is optimized.  The page itself is optimized for search engines.  The design will be optimized for easy viewing.  Easy printing.  Easy sharing.  SEO will not just be on the resume itself, but also for searching.  Need a Rails Developers in Atlanta Georgia? We'll make that easy to find.<p>4. You're always promoting yourself.  The goal is to make a search for your name appear at or near the top of the search result.  This is, after all, your page with your professional information.<p>5. No ads.  I mean, the entire site is basically an advertisement, each page for a particular person, if you want to get technical, but no flashing banner ads, text ads, etc.<p>6. Low cost.  Pay a yearly fee, something reasonable.<p>There is a lot of potential for expanding the services offered.  Being able to put up a portfolio would be important.  Pictures of yourself if you wanted.  Customization through CSS.<p>Standards would be important.  Exporting contact information as well as the resume itself.  All the data would be used and indexed on.  Searching and pages could be made on anything.<p>Anyway's, that's a brief overview of the idea.  There are tons of other specifics, and other ideas, as well as ways to go about marketing it and getting users.  My questions are simple:<p>1. Would you pay for a service like this?\n2. Do you know others that would pay for a service like this?\n3. Have you ever built an online resume/portfolio?\n4. Would this service benefit professionals in industries outside web developers?\n5. Would businesses outside web-based/focused companies use such a means to find employers?<p>I'm sure there are other questions, I'll have, and frankly, you don't need to answer these questions point by point.  Just wanted to give you an idea of some of the initial questions I might have.  Any input at all is encouraged.<p>As a final point, I've searched online for a service like this, and while I've found a few that promote the same basic thing, I haven't found anything that really capture what I would want in a service.  In tech-terms: a Web 2.0 Online Resume site.<p>I've put a lot of thought into this, played around with some initial designs, hacked up some code, but at this stage, I'm more eager to gain some initial feedback before investing heavily into this idea.  So, have at it.<p>And thanks for reading.",1274965769

It is, pretty much, just better than XCode. Overnight, the superior development platform for an Apple device would be a Windows machine. Unless they're really planning on EOLing OS X and their non iP* businesses, why would they want the best developer environment to be hosted on a rival platform? Killing or abandoning OS X seems insane - desk/laptops still account for 50% of their income, and currently most OS X developers are also targeting iP* devices in parallel with their desktop work. Moreover, the iPhone halo effect is getting them more Mac sales and Mac developers. Whilst they're not hurting for iPhone apps, why give developers the incentive to stop buying Macs, buy Windows, kill off their OS X development, and throw out a hugely profitable segment of Apple's business to gamble on Android not eating their iPhone lunch?<p>I suspect this is just an analysts ""blue sky"" nonsense, or a confusion over e.g. development environments for Office 2011 Mac.

1965388,comment,1964613,1964613,0,0,finton,,,"My outsider's opinion is that I think that a lot of cited articles are not always thoroughly examined, or of they are examined they are used to confirm the biases of a particular researcher.<p>I recently became interested in the idea of possible anesthetic neurotoxicity in infants and looked at a number of papers. The basic research seems solid, but the conclusions drawn are strangely inconsistent.<p>Neonatal rat, mouse and pregnant guinea pig models are used, and recent studies have been done on monkeys.  It appears that there is a high incidence of cell death after exposure to anesthesia, but there is a relatively narrow window of vulnerability, which apparently peaks at 7 days postnatal in rats and rapidly diminishes. 5 day old monkeys were affected by prolonged exposure to ketamine, and 35 day old monkeys were not. Similar results were seen in guinea pigs.<p>What strikes me, is that this window of vulnerability is differently equated to human development by researchers, despite years of research into ethanol neurotoxicity (anesthetic studies seem to be more recent). Estimates for 7 to 14 day old rat-human equivalents range from pre-term infants to full-term newborns, to mid-gestation human fetuses and to children up to 3 years old. Two monkey papers, one using ketamine, and another using isoflurane also came up with different vulnerability periods based on similar data by using different sources of information on neurodevelopment, one published in the 1970's and one more recent.<p>I cannot understand how so many studies could have statements about possible windows of human neurotoxicity, without any certainty about what phase in neurodevelopment they were dealing with. And, oddly enough, the paper describing the model that is used to claim a mid-gestation vulnerability (based on a ""bioinformatics approach"") clearly states that it cannot be used to predict the ""coordinated surge in synaptogenesis just prior to birth in primates"", which is hypothesized to be the peak period of vulnerability to anesthetic-induced cell death. So why is it used as a source?",1291373482

I can see the appeal\nof Aquamacs to people who were Mac users first, and Emacs users later,\nbut I'm the other way round. For my tastes, Aquamacs is trying a bit\ntoo hard to be Mac-like, and is just different enough from Emacs to be\nmaddening to use. I used it for about a year and half before I\nswitched to standard Emacs, and I'm much happier since. Bundling a\nbunch of apparently randomly-selected extra modes was the thing I\nliked least about Aquamacs, but there were lots of other irritating\nfeatures, not to mention various incompatibilities with my familiar\nEmacs configuration.<p>For the past few months, I've been running Yamamoto Mitsuharu's\nexperimental ""Mac port"" of standard Emacs. Probably the only way you'd\nknow about it is if you read the emacs-dev mailing list. Mitsuharu-san\nhas taken some of the best features of the old Carbon Emacs (which\nmany people still run, apparently!), along with a few new ones, and\nported them to Emacs 23 to make a hybrid Cocoa/Carbon app. Among the\nextra features are smoother scrolling, support for gestures on the\nMagic Trackpad/Magic Mouse, integration with Services on Mac OS X\n10.6, and support for Emacs as the default mailer for mailto: links\n(yes!).<p>Mitsuharu-san's changes aren't yet integrated into mainline Emacs, but\nhe publishes regular patches against it. He claims it's still an\nexperimental port; however, I've only encountered one bug in the 5 or 6\nmonths I've been using it, which he promptly fixed once I reported\nit.

When it got to an absurd level with some nurses (who explained things like how to add several numbers by lining them up, putting a line underneath with a plus sign next to it, and then using a calculator to find the result (true story)), I thought about it some more and it must be because they need to target the lowest common denominator.

1965353,comment,1962003,1963529,0,0,newt,,,"My confidence is from experience.<p>You could argue that without a coherent design, your next iteration is going to be longer. I'd argue the reverse - but it depends on what you mean by ""big upfront design""<p>Every program, TDD or not, needs to get a basic architectural outline in place early on - e.g. decide if you're building a web app or a desktop client, which framework you'll use to build it. Usually you have a good idea of a lot of other major pieces of that you want in your architecture - they're there in ""best practices"" such as SOLID, repository pattern, CQRS, MVVM, etc. TDDs encourages ""spikes"" that prove the concept with a vertical slice through all layers of the app.<p>In my opinion and experience, ""Big, upfront design"" is a 1980s-1990s idea that all details of the program, not just the outlines, can be designed once before coding commences. And it is a completely false idea. TDD and agile say that you're going to redesign anyway, so you may as well accommodate that. This is where TDD speeds things up. Change is not just adding things to a program, it involves redesign on existing parts.<p>But I agree that an ounce of data is better than a pound of theory in this case.

I agree VS is and has consistently been the best single IDE when you are using Windows to write software that runs on Windows, but it fails miserably out of its narrow domain (however deep it is, as it accounts for a huge market share). It's much like Xcode being the best IDE for using an Apple computer to write software that runs on Apple computers. It certainly is.<p>Microsoft deserves some recognition, for many times they delivered what the market needed. From its very first BASIC interpreter, to Windows, to Windows for Workgroups, to the first affordable alternative to Unix on RISC boxes (NT, for those too young to remember), to Visual Basic (the only language many corporate developers ever knew) they more or less set the tone of the entire PC industry.<p>As for charging money for software, the market changed.

But I felt it would be too stressful for a human being like Pac Man to be continually surrounded and hunted down. So I created the monsters’ invasions to come in waves. They’d attack and then they’d retreat. As time went by they would regroup, attack, and disperse again. It seemed more natural than having constant attack.”\n - Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man creator",1291371190

1965330,comment,1963776,1964298,0,0,roel_v,,,"This is what struck me most about this article - that they seemed to think it was OK to sit in a a restaurant with a laptop open on the table, and not even being coy about it! It's plain disrespectful, not even so much to the people at your table (who presumably are either ok with it or at least know the person and could interfere), but more to the other patrons and staff. Imagine going out for nice night in town and some moron pulls out his computer at the table next to you and starts banging away and polluting the atmosphere with his bright lcd screen. Luckily around here waiters are starting to stand up for patrons and are asking people on their phones to move outside while they talk (which is a comparable social faux pas, but happens much more).<p>(note that it depends on the definition of 'restaurant' - I realize that McDonalds is called a 'restaurant' too in some parts of the world, I mean a place with tablecloths and staff that comes to your table, so starting at around a neighborhood pizza place or so. Also I've asked my wife to move to the bar or the lobby several times when she got out her computer in similar situations, I've been on all sides of the table on this one.)",1291370988

1965323,comment,1963990,1964520,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think that's the proximate cause: lots more competition and more insecure academic positions leads to more ruthless interactions with colleagues, a term that itself might be getting a bit obsolete with the decline of collegiality.<p>If I had to pick one part of it that bugged me most, it'd be the constant need to attack and dismiss other people's research. Very few scientists these days refer to something like the ""excellent recent treatment of the subject by Professor So-and-so"", unless it's a treatment of a subject that doesn't compete with the author's own research. Instead, usual practice is to paint competing research in the worst possible light, and only grudgingly admit any related work that was actually on-point and good.<p>There was PhD Comics strip somewhere that jokingly listed phrases least likely to appear in a scientific paper, one of which was, ""Previous work by X et al (2009) was actually pretty good!"". Of course, it's not entirely because authors have suddenly become huge jerks; the incentives on them push in that direction. With many more submissions, reviewers have gotten much harsher about demanding that authors distinguish themselves from existing work and prove that theirs is novel and superior, which supplies an incentive for authors to trash existing work.",1291370793

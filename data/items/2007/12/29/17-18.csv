I had trouble finding the ""About Newsconomy"" link (hidden at the bottom), and once I did it didn't make sense to me. I'm not a baseball person so that metaphor didn't draw me in. You might consider adding a more prominent ""Start Here"" link or some such thing that would provide examples of cool things your app can do. Good luck.",1198949464

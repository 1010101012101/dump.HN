3336463,comment,3336364,3336364,10,0,bdarnell,,,"A lot of the recent discussion around python3 has been about how 2to3 is slow and inconvenient, so this seems like a good  time to plug my attempt to improve the process.  <a href=""https://github.com/bdarnell/auto2to3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bdarnell/auto2to3</a> uses an import hook to run 2to3 on changed files automatically, and cache the results on disk between runs so it doesn't have to run 2to3 over the entire project every time (and the caches are ordinary files so you can see exactly what 2to3 is producing).<p>This is how I added Python 3 support to Tornado.  If you intend to keep supporting Python 2.5, I definitely recommend using 2to3 instead of the contortions required to use a single codebase  across all versions (if you're only supporting 2.6+ it gets much easier to do everything in one codebase without 2to3, although even then 2to3 can help keep the primary (2.x) codebase cleaner).",1323478791

3336459,comment,3335404,3335404,7,0,HilbertSpace,,,"So, the author asks:<p>""What do you think?  Do you think people overestimate the value of an idea or am I just full of it?""<p>Along with the author is ""Ideas are easy and plentiful.  Execution is hard and everything.""<p>Well, first what is being discussed is just an intuitive, off-hand, wild guess, up all night, sophomore beer party bull session 'business idea'.<p>The 'subtext', the real intention of saying that an idea is worthless is to insult, intimidate, and denigrate entrepreneurs.<p>For most such bull session ideas, yes, they are nearly worthless.  Fine.  But we knew that.<p>But this whole theme totally throws out all the baby with the bathwater.  The theme says that that the haystack is mostly just hay with only a few golden needles so throws out the whole haystack.<p>We know:  Any major business success is quite exceptional and necessarily so since the economy can't have everyone a billionaire.<p>The goal, then, is NOT to say something general about the haystack but to find the golden needles, not to notice that the average is nearly worthless but to say how to find GOOD business ideas.<p>So, first cut for something better we should say:<p>Good ideas are difficult.  Given a good idea, execution should be routine.<p>Why routine?  That's easy to see:  All across the US, coast to coast, border to border, from villages with just one crossroad up to towns and the largest cities, the US is just awash in entrepreneurs who as 'sole proprietors' had a 'business idea' and executed successfully enough to buy a house, support a family, get the kids through college, and have a secure retirement.  You know their companies -- general contracting, roofing, plumbing, electrical contracting, kitchen and bath remodeling, paving, grass mowing, landscaping, masonry, auto repair, auto body repair, tire shops, muffler and brake shops, big truck-little truck suppliers of enormous variety, pizza carryout, Chinese carryout, Italian red sauce red checked tablecloth restaurants, white table cloth French restaurants, 'drive-ins, diners, and dives', dentists, barbers, gas stations, convenience stores, CPAs, tax accountants, business lawyers, pediatricians, dermatologists, podiatrists, independent insurance agents, and on and on.<p>They nearly never get venture capital, but at the bodies of water they own nearly all the yachts from 35 feet to 60 feet when nearly none of the yachts are owned by anyone who got venture capital.<p>So, there are millions of such successful sole proprietors.  So we have to conclude that, given a reasonably good 'business idea', being successful enough for, say, a 50 foot yacht is 'routine', that is, doesn't require an MBA or 'marquee' CEO or a really good 'top management team'.  Indeed, as we know well, the US is just awash in people who have successfully managed organizations from a few dozen people up to a few thousand in education, the military, or government.  So, getting competent, proven general management talent is also 'routine'.<p>So, let's hear no more of how difficult execution is or how much special expertise and advice is needed.<p>Then for the 'good idea', there really are such.  Good ideas are golden, not worthless, plentiful, or obvious.  And there are some sufficient conditions for a good idea, and these conditions have been well proven.  So the idea that we can't get good ideas is shaky.<p>A good business idea is close to having a solid plan.  Can we have a solid plan?  In many crucial fields, absolutely:  From building tall bridges, high dams, tall buildings, long ships, and much more, we can get solid bids that will be executed on time, within budget, with only reasonable profits.<p>So, the idea that we can't plan effectively is shaky.<p>How to have a 'good idea'?  Here is an example:  (1) Pick a serious cancer.  (2) Find a molecule that is a safe, effective, inexpensive cure for that cancer.  Done.  That's a sufficient condition.  Is this a good idea?  Clearly it is:  As soon as safe, effective, and inexpensive have been demonstrated, there is no shortage of large pharmaceutical companies ready, willing, able, and eager to buy the patent on the molecule for big bucks right away.  Then, indeed, the execution is routine and not ""everything"".  Indeed, the idea was everything, and all the rest was easy.<p>Is finding such a good idea easy?  No.  But I didn't say that meeting the sufficient conditions was easy.  Indeed, I said that it was ""difficult"".<p>So, from this example we begin to see what a good idea is and why, with a good idea, execution is routine.<p>Is there a general way to find good ideas?  Sure:  First, pick a problem where a much better solution will be valuable.  Second, do some research to find such a solution.<p>How to do such research?  Sure:  The US is just awash, the unchallenged, unique world-class, grand champion, in how to do research.  Indeed of the world's top 50 research universities, nearly all are in the US, and you know a lot of the names:  Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Yale, NYU, Columbia, SUNY, Rockefeller, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, UNC, Georgia Tech, CMU, Chicago, U. Illinois, U. Michigan, U. Wisconsin, U. Washington, U. California, Stanford, Cal Tech, and more.  Not a big secret.<p>How to do research?  There's education for that, the Ph.D.<p>Does research connect with solid plans for projects?  Sure it does.  The unique, world-class, all-time grand champion of research funding knows this, and this is why they fund the research universities.  This grand champion has known this for over 70 years.  Who is the champion?  May I have the envelope, please?  Here it is:  The grand champion is the US DoD.  The research they funded has led to fantastic progress in bombs, rockets, airplanes, submarines, etc.  We got radar, sonar, the images for Google Earth, GPS, stealth, and much more.  In just two words, it works.<p>A good example is the SR-71:  It was proposed just on paper and was delivered essentially as promised.<p>Can such research play a role in Web 2.0 Internet startups?  Sure.  How?  Exercise for the reader.  Hint:  Notice the remarks above.<p>But do VCs know this?  In biomedical technology, often yes.  In information technology hardware, also often yes.  In just software for Web 2.0, could count without taking shoes off all the VCs with backgrounds to evaluate relevant research.  So, for Web 2.0, the answer is essentially no.<p>Does this answer of no mean that research for Web 2.0 is impractical?  No:  All across the US sole proprietors without VC funding start carryout pizza shops.  Some of these entrepreneurs grow to, say, 10 pizza shops.  Then they can buy a small yacht.  But the capital required for a Web 2.0 startup is much less than for just one pizza shop.  So if pizza shop entrepreneurs can convert their ideas to money, then a Web 2.0 entrepreneur should be able to convert a good research idea to money.<p>Back to it; I've done the research and have nearly all the software done and a little more to write.  But what is crucial is the 'idea', that is, the research, and the software is just routine.  Then users will like it or they won't, and in either case the execution will be routine.<p>So, to answer the author's question, yes, he's ""full of it"", not in the average case but in the relevant, desired, exceptional case.",1323478714

Of course, it is a combination of the two, but it is greatly mistaken to think that ideas are next to worthless. I think Daniel Bobke (commented on original post) has it right, when he commented that a good idea is necessary but not sufficient for success. Bad ideas are a dime a dozen, but good/great ideas are rare indeed. Though at times it is hard to tell if an idea is a good/great idea. I think a truly good idea will motivate you to work hard and as Jake Croston (commented on original post) stated drive you to keep going to find the path to good execution, even if you fail at first. Think about it another way: would you rather work for a firm that had (1) a great idea, but terrible execution or (2) a terrible idea, but great execution?

The problem with mantras is that they are oft quoted, but rarely contemplated.<p>Ideas come to nothing without execution, but execution will have no direction without an idea to foster.<p>The real problems come when someone trades the weight of the idea against contributing work.

Swoop ins and other animations will often give the program around 500 milliseconds before it has to be responsive. It gives the illusion of things working faster than they actually are.

Let me try again.<p>It's a knock on all rigid processes and dogma, not agile in particular. I trimmed the rant down by taking out the sections that rip into UX firms, with their Big Upfront Design and cocky rockstar designer personas, but it could just as easily been about them. I only cut it because I thought the parallels were obvious with the diagram on the Epic Consulting website.<p>What I'm saying is that if waterfall means people are grouped together by specialty - programmers with programmers, designers with designers - each group is run by one dominant process suited to only one of the specializations, and each group tends to work in different stages, then both traditional UX design and agile development are run as de facto waterfall teams, whether by explicit hierarchies or simple stakeholder buy-in.<p>Consider this - what's the difference between:<p>1) a PM spec'ing things out in advance and basically telling everybody what to do and in which order.<p>2) an agile shop coding things up on the fly and telling the designers to run after them to clean up the visuals without making major changes, so they might as well be building to a spec.<p>3) a UX firm mapping out how the product works before handing off to peon engineers that can't make major changes and might as well be building to a spec.<p>To end on a positive note, there is one other solution to expertise, by the way. It's grouping teams by product, not role, and figuring out an interdisciplinary way to work together, rather than running the entire team by the methodology of one specialty. That way you're picking good ideas from across different processes and adapting to the company culture to boot. For example, TypeKit does daily stand ups at 10:05am every day and that's an aspect of agile that they've liked enough to use for the whole company, but I'd be surprised if their designers were checking their art assets into Pivotal Tracker or the programmers were writing up UX journey maps of each user persona.<p>Steve Jobs always liked to describe Apple as the biggest startup he knew and a more accurate description would be that it's a collection of startups, with each one focused on a single product.

That isn't Facebook's fault (insomuch as they actively encourage this), it's just a natural human reaction ported to a new context and environment.<p>The reason this hits the HBR crowd particularly hard is because it adds another, ubiquitous front to the battle of positive image.  It used to be, you only had to be an assertive, bright, shining star when you were <i>around</i> people or talking on the phone.  Then you could go home, pour yourself a belt of Glenlivet, and be miserable for a while to blow off steam.  Now you have to keep it up ALL of the time, on a medium that's everywhere and never stops.  It hits hard, particularly when you're a hard charger whose career depends on being perceived as relentlessly successful and upbeat.",1323475360

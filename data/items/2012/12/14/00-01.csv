4919031,comment,4917828,4918653,2,0,Zak,,,"I think one could make a very good argument that Facebook is Geocities 3.0 (and Myspace was 2.0), or perhaps that Geocities was in the same space, but didn't understand the problem it actually should have been solving. Livejournal probably deserves a mention here, though I don't think it ever achieved quite the prominence of the other three.<p>What most people seem to want to do with a personal website is provide some contact information, list some stuff they like, link to their friends and family and occasionally tell the world what they're up to. Personalizing the appearance of one's personal page seemed important, looking at Geocities and Myspace, but Facebook seems to suggest that it might not be necessary. On the other hand, interaction with other users has become more important.",1355446761

Some things did have to go to enable the new ways, but some are also the victims of happenstance and circumstance.  Some losses are implementation details really, or nice-to-haves that got cut for time/budget.

Could long lost characteristics of the internet be rolled back into the current state of affairs in a beneficial way?<p>I think so.

The usual rules of working in a garbage collected language still apply -- references are references, and keeping an event bound to another object is a reference to that object.<p>`listenTo` and `stopListening` just give you an inverted (and often easier) way to manage the references ... so that you can remove all of the references from the ""other"" side. For example:<p><pre><code>    view.listenTo(model, 'change', view.renderChange);\n    view.listenTo(collection, 'add', view.addItem);\n    view.listenTo(Backbone, 'initialLoad', view.reinit);\n\n    # ... and then, when you want to get rid of the view:\n\n    view.remove(); \n    # Calls view.stopListening(), removing *all* of the\n    # events from ""view"" bound on all of those different objects.\n</code></pre>\nNote that none of this is necessary if you throw away both sides of the bound event at the same time -- those will still be GC'd as usual.

Yes, ultimately its about genes attempting to propagate themselves. But completely ignoring higher ""levels"" of selection is overly reductionist.

While technically true, this analysis is not at the correct level of abstraction for maximum understanding (also the same reason why we don't program in assembly).<p>Genes create behaviors in their host organisms. This is a large class of affects that genes have that ultimately exert selective pressures. This is the correct level of abstraction to understand this mechanism.

If I was going to buy a new desktop today it would certainly be a pc.  A new laptop?  I suspect an ultrabook but it might be a retina MBP.  In the same way I like the iphone but I don't stand in line on release day nor do I buy every one nor do I expect to always buy iphones or even phones in the future. The iphones I've bought have always been because, when I went to buy phones, it was the best phone.

Germany has a civil law system while England has a common law system. German cases are decided by a panel of professional judges, while in England juries can be used. German lawyers are paid on a task based system, while English lawyers are paid by the hour. The German system needs one lawyer per claimant and defendant, for cases where English law would need three solicitors, a partner, some trainee solicitors, and two or three barristers. In the German system there are no punitive damages, only compensation.<p>Because of these differences, a claim with legal costs of 10,000 euros or less in Germany can cost several million pounds in legal fees in England.<p>How a country's legal system works can radically alter the costs of going to court.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/research/project/comparative-study-costs-defamation-proceedings-across-europe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/research/project/comparative-st...</a>",1355443930

In the US, anyone licensed to practice law (with a few minor exceptions) and who does so is counted as a ""lawyer"".

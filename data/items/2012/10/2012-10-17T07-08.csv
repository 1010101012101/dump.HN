We are scaling to a stage where I've to go from doing things hands-on myself to delegating that stuff to others. When it was just me doing, it was simpler. Now there are lots of things I need to juggle, and I'm moving from primarily a developer to core CTO kind of job profile with responsibilities of being Tech-architect, Engineering/product manager/TechOps etc kind of a role who will be coding only part-time and major time managing. (This is just to give you a background).<p>I'm constantly finding myself losing track of things, small but important things. I'd like to know how you plan your day? I'm inclined to just keep a diary and jot down important things, but rescheduling/searching/follow-up kind of tasks are not best solved by this method. Do you guys use any productivity tools? Google Calendar? Also, any simple yet effective tips for me? Life hack kind of a thing? I know it's a very generic question and I can find 100 different ideas floating around on the web. But I'd like to take advantage of collective knowledge of the community and have a dialog on the same.<p>Regards,",1350460683

As <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Equals_sign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Equals_sign</a> says, with citations, equality in big-O notation is usually used in an asymmetric way.  Sure, Colin's preferred notation would be theoretically better, but the common usage supported by authorities up to and including Knuth is that, for instance, O(n) = O(n^2) but not O(n^2) = O(n).  Using the definitions that lead to that, I demonstrated that O(2^n) = O(3^n) but that the reverse is not true.<p>On question 3, I knew full well about the disk win, but failed to say it. :-(  Oh well...<p>Anyways, as others have said, thank you Colin for being willing to put this together and do the work.",1350460287

My CS (Computing and AI to be precise) degree was more than 20 years ago now.<p>1) ""Question: Is O(2^n) equal to O(3^n)? Why?"" - correct... but only because I got a very similar question wrong back in 1990 and learned my lesson then.<p>2) ""Question: What is the expected run-time of quicksort? What is the worst-case run-time"" - Correct - but I had to work it out. Didn't know the answer off the top of my head. 20 years ago I would have know the answer off the top of my head.<p>3) ""What is the difference between a binary tree [EDIT: that should be binary search tree] and a B-tree? When and why does this difference matter?"" - had to google b-tree before I was 100% sure of the right answer... the previous couple of questions had primed me to be thinking in terms of algorithmic complexity rather than immediately jumping to high fan out as the reason.<p>4) First part got wrong - coz back in the day when we were taught heap sort we didn't break down the algorithm in this way with those names. I was taught sort algorithms at A level (for US folk - highschool 16-18 rather than university)... so it's more than 25 years back for me now).  The two chunks we had were, as I recall, making heap and sorting heap, rather than making heap and selecting largest element. I could tell you that heap sort has a better worst case time than quicksort off the top of my head though.<p>5. Couldn't do without googling what 'bipartite' means. Didn't really do much, if any, graph theory in our degree.<p>The other thing that pops into my head is how little I've had to use the more ""CS"" bits of my degree in the last 20 odd years of my career. ;-)",1350460078

So, what I'm about to say isn't directed at what he wrote, but at a somewhat larger attitude.<p>To over 90% of business owners, hearing someone describe ""The Struggle"" with problems like, ""my venture capitalist said we'd have trouble raising funds this year"" is ... I'm not honestly sure how to describe it. Some mixture of hilarity and deep, wretched, hopeless sadness.<p>A tremendous number of business owners don't have access to capital to grow their business, beyond what they can accumulate in credit and savings. Nor do many of them have a soft landing if their business falters; they rely on their business, every month, to make a living wage. They don't start worrying when Europe has a crisis, they start worrying when the local gas prices go up 20 cents overnight because they've seen first-hand what it does to their business.<p>They don't just have to deal with losing a loyal customer over the phone or email, they have to deal with an irate customer <i>in person</i>. How many startup founders do you think can handle that with grace and dignity?<p>One of my favorite business clients is a strong mother of 2 who runs a small boutique shop. Her industry has been hard hit by the economy. I was there working on her equipment one day when the last customer left and she spontaneously broke down in tears because it had been a tough day, a tough week, a tough and relentless Summer. She couldn't solve her business's problems by getting in front of a bunch of employees and giving them a pep talk; she had to solve it by getting up the next morning and sticking with it even when it looked hopeless.<p>Don't put it all on your shoulders? If you're a small business owner, what the hell else are you going to do? Nobody else is going to figure out where the next invoice is coming from. Nobody else is going to say, ""That was my fault, not yours."" You're responsible for all of it. Every single aspect.<p>Funding? I've never -- not <i>once</i> -- had anyone believe in me or my business enough to offer me money to make it bigger. Not even credit. Not even a loan. At some point you accept that this actually is your fault, that people have really good reasons for not wanting to support your business, despite the fact that you have built it from absolutely nothing, despite somehow managing to attract one or two really bright people, despite having hundreds of customers who <i>love</i> you to the extent that you no longer spend any money on marketing because your customers do a better job of telling other people about you than any marketing can.<p>But you keep going anyway.<p>Nothing in that piece was wrong, and I'm certainly not dismissing the challenges that CEOs of well-funded companies face. But, I sure wish that more people had more respect for small businesses, because if you really want to know how to handle The Struggle, <i>go talk to a small business owner</i>.<p>Regarding the checkers/chess game reference, there's an even better game to reference. It's the oldest continuously-played board game in the world, it was originally developed as a tool for teaching business, it takes minutes to learn and I think nobody has ever mastered it, it's a great way to develop intuition about when to be aggressive and when to be defensive, and it has a perfect balance of tactics and strategy: it's called Go. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)</a>",1350459783

All the user needs to do is install Chrome and visit a URL. Updating the app becomes trivial.<p>I am not saying it is the clear winner, but to me it sounds like a damn interesting alternative with a lot of promise.<p>It is also <i>possible</i> that Chrome will ""win"" - either by gaining such majority user-base that targeting specific features of Chrome becomes worth while, or because Dart+Native Client becomes a de facto standard the other browsers adopt.<p>Also, if you are writing a ""web app"" to target a niche market that really want to use the application (hard-core gamers?), requiring Chrome really may not be a big deal for the user-base.

4663486,comment,4661155,4662040,4,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Scarcasm/trolling aside, it's not four years of scaling because they didn't need more than one server until late last year.""<p>There are many axes on which you can scale and many different interpretations. People have reported that postgres scales very well to many cores and many concurrent users (something like 300K read queries per second or something ridiculous[1]). It also scales nicely for concurrent writes and avoids locking in situations where most other databases don't.<p>There may be cases where postgres adapted plans (automatically using statistics and the cost-based optimizer, of course) for them as their data grew. Responding to data growth is a kind of scaling -- if using a database without that capability, it may be stuck with a horrible plan that falls over as the data grows.<p>Scaling to multiple servers is, no doubt, important; but it's not the only important definition of ""scaling"" (if it were, then multi-core would just be a fad). Lots of technologies scale to many servers beautifully, but lose focus on other aspects of scalability or are just plain inefficient.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2012/03/performance-and-scalability-on-ibm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2012/03/performance-and-scalabilit...</a>",1350459320

The goal of these facilities is to provide the stability necessary for a person to compensate and, ideally, re-enter society.<p>Some folks need to enter a crisis center for a short stay during a time of instability.  Some simply need a place to live (supported housing) with just a little more structure.

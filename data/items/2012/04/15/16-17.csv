3844077,comment,3842033,3842033,5,0,defen,,,"If you're in California, trial by written declaration[1] is a great way to deal with minor traffic violations.  The way it works is that you fill out a form[2] giving your version of events, and submit a check for the amount of the ticket.  The beauty of this is that the officer also has to fill out a form giving his version of events - and if he doesn't, you automatically win and your money is refunded.  It's the equivalent of the officer not showing up to your court case.  If he does submit the form you might still win if the judge sides with you.  And if you lose, you can request <i>another</i> trial by written declaration.  I'm 2/2 using this strategy for minor violations, and I haven't had to waste any time in traffic court.  In both cases I won because the officer did not submit his version of events - probably because it's boring work and they had better things to do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d17/vc40902.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d17/vc40902.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr205.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr205.pdf</a>",1334509183

Actually, at times - even if you build some thing absolutely awesome - people may not come.<p>The reason behind this is called ""Value Attribution"" - if you really want to understand the concept behind this - please refer to a very famous experiment conducted by Washington Post but heres the summary of what they did.<p>The Washington Post asked world renowned Violinist  Joshua Bell to play on his 3.5 million dollar violin at Washington D.C metro station without revealing his identity.<p>The hypothesis was that Joshua Bell, who had given tons of sold out performances on auditoriums where tickets averaged $100/person, would be able to gather a large crowd just based on his sheer talent.<p>But, after playing some of the most intricate music ever written on a 3.5 million violin that was hand crafted by Antonio Stradivari in 1713, Joshua Bell could not get ANY TRACTION.  During his 45-minute performance  no one really stopped by to listen to his performance let alone gathering a crowd to appreciate it!<p>So we might wonder  what went so wrong?  Why did Joshua Bell fail to get any traction?<p>Well the answer lies in Value Attribution and Crowd Mindset!<p>The people traveling through Metro station that morning did not recognize that the person-playing Violin was a world famous violinist Joshua Bell.  They also did not realize that the violin that was being played was worth 3.5 million dollars.  To them, it was simply a guy playing violin on a busy morning.  What is a value of a guy-playing violin on subway station?  Nothing right? So  no one really stopped or even paid much attention.<p>The same thing is true when you build a product.  People subconsciously attribute value to every product.  This is the primary reason I believe that no one will come just because you build a product.<p>From above example, you should be able to tell that even if your product is world-renowned but if people fail to recognize the value of your product, they will not come.<p>So, it is very important to create a good product but then it is even more important to communicate its value to the users.  Once you are able to do those two things then only are you ready to talk about user acquisition and user retention.<p>Your product value creation is your sales funnel or better known as your value proposition.  The users whom you plan to acquire must first travel through your sales funnel in order to understand the value of your product.  So where or how you pick up your users it is not that important.  What is critically important is what you show them along the way.<p>The second thing that is equally important during user acquisition cycle is to understand their mindset.  For example, it is easy see that the mindset of the crowd on a subway station in above example was surely different from the mindset of the crowd in a live theater.  The people at subway station were there to catch a train and you can safely assume that they were not interested in listing to music.  The music was probably the last thing in their mind so even though, more than 1000 people passed by, no one really stopped or appreciated the music.<p>Similarly, bringing a crowd of 25K users to your site on day one may make you feel good but it does not add any value unless its the right crowd with right mindset!  I think the focus should be on acquiring the right customers but that will only happen if you truly understand the value proposition of your product and then be able to communicate it with right set of customers!",1334507275

Please, do describe your fix for laziness, if it's so easy.<p>Saying ""just be less lazy"" is exactly the same as saying ""just exert more willpower"", and neither is even remotely useful to people whose problems you're belittling as being ""just laziness / poor willpower"". No therapist would say that to any client for any problem, as they know it would, at best, be completely useless. It's an insult - ""you're lazy / weak-willed!"" - masquerading as advice.",1334506215

3843942,comment,3843724,3843724,4,0,homosaur,,,"I essentially find his argument incoherent. What's he complaining about, that publishers don't have the right to illegally fix prices? They can set prices to whatever they want but can do so on their own marketplaces. Amazon has the right to impose whatever it wants on their marketplace. You don't have to sell there. Now we can once again make this argument that Amazon dominates the marketplace and you HAVE to sell there to sell any books, but that argument is ridiculous. Plenty of small publishers are selling books solely by themselves or with limited agreements with independent marketplaces.<p>This seems like sour grapes from more middlemen who are unneeded. This is why the music industry is so bitter--because the Internet makes them irrelevant. There will be a need for promotion, yes, but I'd rather pay a smart literary agent 15% or even 20% to handle that rather than some publisher where I'm basically getting dimes on the backend. I'm not aware of any promotion that Smashwords ever executed that reached me, so clearly they are not even doing a great job.<p>It's a dark day for industry middlemen and that's it.<p>BY THE WAY, I will pay a premium well over $20 if you distribute your ebooks in multiple DRM free formats. I just paid $40 for the InDesign CS5 Classroom in a Book yesterday which came with a PDF and an EPUB. If publishers are too lazy to do that, we have no use for them anyway.",1334506040

Try and think about other ones (TV, search, music...)<p>This type of writing sure gets people excited and attracts many readers but it's a quite destructive way to think of our world. Just because something has certain annoying problems or has maybe become boring and mundane does not mean that the only way to make it better is to completely reconstruct it. Most ""It's broken"" essays usually come with a dangerous degree of hubris and presuppose that in order to make things better, the offending industry needs full destruction before it can be rebuilt and renewed in the image of writer's glorious new vision (often times this vision is not even presented - it seems that something being ""broken"" implies that there is a better and completely different way of doing it). Lessons learned doing things the old way become meaningless or at least decline in value because, well it's broken.. we didn't really learn that much right?<p>I agree that sometimes a complete re-framing is needed to get on the (more) correct path towards making something better or at least just to allow yourself to ""think outside of the box"". But going on a deconstruction campaign of everything that's served us reasonably well thus far is another box which you can easily trap yourself into.",1334505739

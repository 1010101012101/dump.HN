Google search results have become increasingly fragmented in an attempt to try to give some hint to where the actual result is. For example a search on Ariana Grande will return a list of sites, some knowledge graph info (from Wikipedia), some news and YouTube links, and now some Twitter links. I put this down to a limitation of algorithmic search and, at least to me, this behavior indicates that Google is not good at determining what the question is. <a href=""http://newslines.org/blog/googles-black-hole/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/blog/googles-black-hole/</a>",1423119571

Easypost&#x27;s Show HN had 157.<p>Perhaps if Jarrett had waited until he found that perfect .com name he wouldn&#x27;t have launched first, and as a result would have had less initial exposure. Less initial exposure means less initial traction, and that might have lead to easypost not raising their first round, or raising on much worse terms, both of which could easily be worth more than $15k.<p>On top of that, finding an available .com isn&#x27;t easy. You essentially end up using a non-english word, mashing several words together, or use something like geteasypost.com (which easypost owned prior to making this purchase).<p>Non-english words are harder to say and recall, and could ultimately affect word of mouth growth. Mashing words together puts you in a similar situation, and nearly every company who owned get<company>.com or try<company>.com ultimately ended up buying <company>.com if they were successful.

There are tomes of knowledge one must acquire that is usually application specific and in potentially narrow fields.  For example, if you want to write a RTOS you need to study and learn OS theory.  Want to work on GPS code? Well, there&#x27;s some math you need to understand along with a pile of other stuff.  Want to work on search?  Better have a very good handle of a range of algorithms and know how to implement them efficiently.  Automation?  Hmmm, you can&#x27;t set an output and expect the machine to respond when there&#x27;s physics involved.  Aircraft control systems? ....<p>The point is that coding is easy just like understanding the basics of running a milling machine is easy.  Being a machinist is far more complex than knowing how to turn the wheels.  And machining highly accurate objects in exotic metals is multiple levels above that.

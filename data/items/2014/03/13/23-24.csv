7396030,comment,7395644,7395644,34,0,tokenadult,,,"The death rate per miles driven in the United States has fallen dramatically in my lifetime, and I can remember when the annual number of deaths was much higher.[1] That said, the article makes a very interesting claim about attitudes that we should all follow to the end of the article for further discussion here: &quot;There’s an open secret in America: If you want to kill someone, do it with a car. As long as you’re sober, chances are you’ll never be charged with any crime, much less manslaughter.&quot; My wife bike-commutes year-round (yes, even in Minnesota), and as I mention this among Facebook friends, other friends who are also bike commuters point out that car drivers can basically kill bicyclists in the United States with no legal penalty at all. That&#x27;s not a good social environment for getting more people out for exercise and energy conservation by substituting bicycling for driving cars.<p>The history reported in this article is very interesting. There are a lot of contemporary photographs of changing American cities. The quotations from experts provide perspective on the visuals: &quot;&#x27;If a kid is hit in a street in 2014, I think our first reaction would be to ask, &quot;What parent is so neglectful that they let their child play in the street?,&quot;&#x27; says Norton.<p>&quot;&#x27;In 1914, it was pretty much the opposite. It was more like, &quot;What evil bastard would drive their speeding car where a kid might be playing?&quot; That tells us how much our outlook on the public street has changed.&quot;<p>Indeed. Are we really thinking carefully about how to spread the risk around, when so much of our living space is dominated by cars?<p>AFTER EDIT: The video link shared by pugz[2] in a reply comment elsewhere in this thread is not to be missed. Car safety standards have improved enormously in my lifetime, but those protect the occupants of cars better than they protect pedestrians and bicyclists who are hit by cars.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year#Motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPF4fBGNK0U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPF4fBGNK0U</a>",1394755021

To really make a difference vs a high end car we could mandate 3 point seat-belts and helmets like you have in racing world.<p>Still a 70MPH a head on collision is already fairly safe assuming people are belted the real killers are unbelted passengers, collision debris, and rolling.

A decent portion of my back yard is devoted to growing - I have seven raised beds* (2.4m x 1.2m) plus trellis up against fences nearby. There are also citrus trees and herbs elsewhere. But having this dedicated space means I had to sacrifice playing space for my child and any future children; there is 55-60sqm of lawn but I&#x27;d have preferred more and there is no paved area for a basketball ring.<p>I wonder if future homes could explore underground growing spaces as well as water storage. Underground rainwater &quot;bladders&quot; are becoming a bit more popular in Australia already.<p>We could, at the time a house is being built, dig down as though for a swimming pool and embed 2-3 shipping containers. There are companies selling quite expensive set-ups with automated watering and lighting, remote monitoring and so on. If a cellar was dug at the same time, access to underground grow space could be through an interior cellar to avoid dealing with hatches and ladders outdoors?<p>One issue would be that this might preclude anything requiring pollination from insects, but there are ways around many cases (manual pollination, air circulation, self-pollinating plants, etc).<p>* Some of the raised beds: <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/UuNB2JD1vk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/UuNB2JD1vk/</a><p>Produce: <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/cTSjSuj1hy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/cTSjSuj1hy/</a><p>Cleaning out a bed to sow seeds last weekend: <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/lTOGElD1ug/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/lTOGElD1ug/</a><p>Another shot from last Winter: <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/cTQKhYj1vC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/cTQKhYj1vC/</a>",1394754704

(I&#x27;m not convinced the word &quot;exploit&quot; is even a useful term in this context.)<p>I would prefer instead frame employment in terms of ordinary economics and say that when any two parties agree on any sort of contract there is likely to be both a <i>producer surplus</i> and a <i>consumer surplus</i>; both sides profit by the exchange. If it made sense to call one of those surpluses &quot;exploitation&quot;, you&#x27;d have to call the other one that too.

I&#x27;m probably never going to convince you that &quot;capitalism&quot; doesn&#x27;t &quot;exploit workers&quot; because to you, &quot;exploiting workers&quot; is part of the <i>definition</i> of &quot;capitalism&quot;.<p>When I say something is an extraordinary claim, I merely mean it&#x27;s a claim that seems intuitively false to me. Since the claim was phrased in a way that didn&#x27;t seem to exclude my own subjective sense of the world as a source of evidence, I consulted that sense, and found the claim wanting.<p>In the end, it seems like the title claim of the article - &quot;you are a Marxist&quot; - probably just doesn&#x27;t apply to me.

Without being inside the author’s head (and perhaps not even then) it’s impossible to know all of the ideas associated with every word and phrase by the author at that particular moment, or the precise rhythm and intonation the author would use in saying the words aloud, or the precise feelings the author was trying to evoke.<p>Or for that matter, is it possible to comprehend something 100% without deeply thinking about what it means to the reader, all the ideas and feelings the words (in context with the rest of the world at the moment of reading) dredge up. For instance, I personally can’t read something in a truly deep way, and really know what I think about it, without writing (often lengthy) comments of my own.

He (from what I remember in his early podcasts) thought about the idea while waiting in customs, and wondered if a game could be made of the drudgery of this work. His commitment to making a game that excelled <i>as a game</i> resulted in a game that was actually <i>fun</i>, while being an artistic achievement and politically engaging, for sympathizers of both the state and the refugee.<p>(As counter-examples, I think &quot;Cart Life&quot; is also an amazing achievement in art, but not a very good game because of  unintentional bugs. Also, most artistic games in which you mostly just walk around until the game ends).<p>David Simon, who created &quot;The Wire&quot;, complains quite bitterly that his intent was to make a show that raged against institution and bureaucracies, and yet people only talked about Omar and all of his other characters...Simon did such a great job of plot and characterization that it overshadowed his political aims. I kind of see &quot;Papers, Please&quot; as the opposite of that...Pope just wanted to make a great game, and he did such a great job of it that it turned out to have a compelling political message.<p>Anyway, it has my vote for being included in the MoMA&#x27;s video game collection.

The demand was so big that Steam approved it for Greenlight out of schedule: It was greenlit after just a week or two on the process.<p>Either way, It&#x27;s a game that is very easy to recommend.",1394753694

This could happen multiple times, creating a deep tree structure, where only leaf nodes could be voted on; the score of the parent nodes would be automatically calculated from its children, all the way to the top (the high-level arguments). Also, any node could be linked to another part of the tree, which they describe as &quot;Facts concluded in one debate by one group of people are reused in other debates.&quot; The whole thing was built on top of MediaWiki, to provide the wiki features of distributed editing, edit history, etc. (and also because the idea came from an attempt to improve Wikipedia discussions).

To understand the structure of a written piece is not easy.  For &quot;dense&quot; works (e.g., some philosophy) it might take reading and re-reading several times, jumping forward and backward, to fully figure out what is being said, whether it makes sense, whether it&#x27;s to be taken as reliable or not.

You have a finite amount of time to process people through the security gate each &#x27;day&#x27; and you&#x27;re paid based on how many people you get through, with fines for incorrect processing (which of course gets harder and more convoluted as the game goes on).<p>At the end of each day, your income and expenses (for rent, food, electricity, medicine for your son/wife/elderly parents as needed) are shown. The tension comes from rushing to process enough people to ensure you don&#x27;t have to go without food, or turn off electricity, or not medicate your family. However, if you make too many mistakes by rushing, you get fined too much and you don&#x27;t get to care for your family.<p>It&#x27;s really far more gripping than you&#x27;d expect because the whole art style, audio and interactions (both between days via a daily newspaper, and with the people as they enter through your booth/events that unfold during that) really help paint a picture of a desolate former soviet wasteland of poverty and misery. Couple that with the distilled essence of &#x27;putting food on the table for your family so they don&#x27;t starve&#x27; being the motivating factor, and it can be quite high-tension to try to not have your family inevitably starve and freeze to death with crippling illness.<p>For $5 (if you grab it during a steam sale), it&#x27;s worth the experience for sure. I&#x27;d have been happy paying the standard $10 for the unique experience it offers.",1394752530

There&#x27;s so much out there to read, and not enough time in my life to do it.  But it is to us as fad diets/exercise regimes to people who care primarily about their looks/weight.<p>I say this because its apparent I&#x27;m a relatively fast reader, i have to read a lot for work, and i have professional colleagues to compare myself to.  In all these speed-reading fads in professional environments, I&#x27;ve never actually met a single person, NOT ONE, who can actually read these materials faster than an intelligent, well read person.  (barring perhaps abnormalities like Kim Peek, but newsflash, you know if you&#x27;re Kim Peek and if you are/aren&#x27;t, there&#x27;s not much you can do about it).  Get someone into an actual environment where they have to read lots of stuff, have to comprehend it, and its professionally demonstrable, and suddenly all the &quot;speed readers&quot; vanish.<p>Do you know why I&#x27;m a relatively fast reader?  I&#x27;d say probably: a) genetics b) reading a lot.<p>b) is about the only thing I&#x27;ve seen that has a big effect and is demonstrable, and is in our control.  The fastest readers read a lot.  The slowest readers don&#x27;t.  Those who didn&#x27;t read a lot, and then started reading, got faster.<p>And barring genetic abnormalities and usual statistical variance, no one I&#x27;ve met, EVER, has been able to read more than 3/4/5/6 hundred words per minute with accurate comprehension.<p>Which brings us of course, to the comprehension debate.  Lets avoid the ridiculousness of the comprehension stats that are usually poorly designed and created by people trying to sell you things, they are worth about as much as fad diet testimonials and figures.  And this is where a lot of speed reading salesmen try to get you.  &quot;I can read this at 1000 wpm with just slightly less comprehension!&quot;.  &quot;I can skim and pull out the important parts really fast!&quot;.<p>To which my feelings can be summed up: Anyone can purport to increase their reading speed by including words they didn&#x27;t read or comprehend in their wpm.  Frankly, if you are not reading something with %100 comprehension, you are not reading it.  Taking a sample and taking a census are two different things.  That you can take a 10% sample in 10% of the time does not make you a &quot;speed-census-taker&quot;.  Ditto skimming, summarizing, or any other weasel-word used to gloss over the fact that someone is trying to speed up their &quot;reading&quot; by reading or comprehending less.<p>I&#x27;m not saying skimming doesn&#x27;t exist.  I am saying its not the same as reading/comprehending, and that &quot;speed-readers&quot; show heavy drops in comprehension.",1394751995

Stuff like staff PCs, internal data warehouses, sales, finance, and marketing software support, WiFi APs, routers, keeping the backoffice servers and network up, ensuring reliable WAN and LAN connectivity so engineers can reach production securely, intrusion detection and analysis, and so on.<p>Generally in smaller software companies I hear R+D and consumer-facing applications referred to as &quot;engineering&quot; with external-facing infrastructure (like the production datacenter) referred to as &quot;operations,&quot; with &quot;IT&quot; being reserved for this internal backoffice kind of stuff.<p>In other places, especially larger corporations, I&#x27;ve often heard everything having to do with a computer lumped in as &quot;IT.&quot;",1394751829

And if history is any guide, given a long enough time horizon, a sizable percentage of businesses become insolvent.<p>I think what he may be thinking about are fire sales.  i.e. when an insolvent business sells assets, the bank has first claim to the proceeds, or can block such sales from occurring at distressed prices.",1394751812

It has 19 pages of references to hundreds of papers on the topic that Rayner has read so the nonexpert does not have to.<p>Generally, reviews are much better sources than individual papers for the non-expert to read because the author has gone through the literature to understand the feuds and arguments and how they have played out. In my field, I regularly have people try to send me papers that were thoroughly thrashed as wrong over a decade ago. That is generally what happens when a non-expert tries to dive into the primary literature blindly without understanding the general framework and consensus that a good review provides.<p>All that said, it is very hard for a non-expert to tell whether a review is good or not.

I firmly believe that popup notifications are unnecessary and distracting, and that's why I prefer the ""notification system"" of OS X (red badges in the dock). These are a standard. Growl and menu bar status icons etc are just useless cruft introduced by developers who don't want to adhere to the standard. I could care less if my OS notifies me that it discovered a new input device, or that someone sent me an email labelled ""urgent"", or whatever.<p>Of course, OS X is not as clean and notification-free as I'd like it to be: It annoys me every other week or so with some useless software update, and every 10 days it complains that I didn't plug in the backup drive for some time.<p>Now, it might be possible to configure and disable all these notifications, but I just don't want to bother. I want my computer to act on my command, and in my eyes there is almost no excuse for putting up an unexpected notification or alert or dialog for anything.",1320695960

We're in dire economic straits, our funding for something as basic and fundamental s our children's educations are being threatened. Public libraries are closing across the country. Research funding is reaching dreadfully low levels - especially in comparison to countries that we now find ourselves competing with.<p>And on top of that, people are getting poorer. Even folks ""protected"" by traditionally pro-labour unions are being thrown under the bus to protect the pensions of its older members. The treatment of young union members by the organization that supposedly protects their rights is laughable if it weren't so damned unjust.<p>So yes, let's look forward. We face a desperate economic situation, in which we must all make deep cuts and great sacrifices if this country is to have a competitive future. Our education system has certainly paid the price. Our arts and culture, too. Taxes are rising, but yet the greatest liability we have is still pension funding.<p>The one quarter where no sacrifices, no compromises must be made. Toss the band program. Screw math textbooks. Fuck scientific research. The pension is holy! It must not be touched!

This would likely be adequate for most ruby projects.  It's my impression that the python community is better supported in the debian world.<p>Suggestion:  the gem utility should be able to generate deb and rpm packages with proper version numbers, and the utility should also have a setting to ""pull from distro repository"" to allow things like bundler to be compatible with apt... this would allow/entail letting multiple gem versions live side by side, which would likely seem like a distro-smell to many sysadmins (though it isn't one).",1320695461

How do you propose to determine whether a student has been taught to think? Whatever your answer is, that's your test.

Answering those would demonstrate thinking ability. But that would still be a test.<p>Tests are important. If they are made well, teaching with the test in mind is fine.<p>Whether we're testing and teaching the right things is another question.

I'll probably move to XFCE or something lighter for the desktop/window management (it's a simple apt-get install plus whatever configuration tweaks one wants to make).<p>Given Ubuntu's current direction, if you were to go with it and want to use the Gnome 2 GUI (""Classic""), I'd say that's all the more reason to go with / stay on the 10.04 long term release (see pilooch's comment).  And keep in mind that you may be leaving Ubuntu altogether by 13.04 at the latest.  Although by that time, you may be looking to retire the Thinkpad (from its current use, at least) regardless.<p>I'm no expert; just the results of my own dinking and thinking.<p>P.S.  Unstated:  If GUI's not a concern, then no worries -- probably go with whatever production environment is of interest to you.",1320692424

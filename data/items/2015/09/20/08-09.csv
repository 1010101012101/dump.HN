With a memory source operand, the higher part of the register is zeroed, which is what you want. No problem.<p>Now the fun part: if the source is not memory but another xmm register, the higher part of the register is <i>not</i> zeroed. This induces a false dependency on the previous value of the destination register that can cause performance issues. To avoid this problem, such register-register copies should be done with a packed move instruction. (Or vmovsd, but that was added much later.)<p>The obvious packed move instruction for 64-bit floats is movapd, but we can do better than that by using movaps - it is still a float domain instruction but is a byte smaller.<p>So the optimal way to move a single double from one register to another is to use a vector move of the wrong type.",1442738430

If you want illustrations of this, compare the HP 42s to the TI 36X Pro. Granted, the HP was more expensive than the TI, but the 36 series is the top of the line for TI at this point.<p>The TI can do integration, complex arithmetic, vectors, and matrices. However, most of it&#x27;s functions don&#x27;t work in the complex domain, and the matrices are limited to 3Ã—3. It has a solver, but that&#x27;s limited. It can&#x27;t store equations or programs.<p>The HP can also do integration, complex arithmetic, vectors, and matrices. Almost all of its functions work in the complex domain (complex matrices are particularly useful). It has a versatile solver, works with matrices of over 10 elements, and can even store user programs (with GUI elements!).<p>My theory on what happened is that normal desktop computers became powerful enough to run mathematical software packages, and graphing calculators became popular.

Casella/Berger is purely frequentist rather than computational or Bayesian, and it spends a lot of time on likelihood theory and treats e.g. bootstrapping only very summarily.",1442736380

But analytic methods fare pretty poorly in these circumstances too and in any case people are mostly interested in confidence intervals around the mean anyway.",1442736251

Here&#x27;s how I see it:<p>- Text ads on websites<p>- People use adblockers,<p>- Apple introduces the iPhone without ad blocking<p>- Website revenue goes up. Many websites use very invasive ads to the point of blocking access to their own content,<p>- Each ad is marginally valuable, so content producers keep adding more; Competitors need to remain valuable, so they follow the trend,<p>- Mobile experience gets broken, so Apple introduces ad blockers,<p>- Websites lose revenue,<p>- And start using DRM to prevent external modification of their websites. Maybe we&#x27;ll even have laws against website alteration...<p>It&#x27;s all over on a massive scale, which prevents alternatives like individual ethics, begging, donations, etc. I&#x27;m not sure there will be a winner, in fact I believe we&#x27;ll reach the same sad state as television.",1442736233

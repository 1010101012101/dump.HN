I personally don't believe it is worth the effort, if you have other ways of resurrecting your website then I would concentrate on that instead.<p>I've gone to court abroad several times and have won in each of those cases, I cared enough that I thought a lawsuit was warranted and even though it cost me plenty I think it was well worth it.

Especially around US election time.<p>And you do live in San Francisco, so for now at least you seem to be part of the US more than of the UK, so maybe that would not have been such a bad assumption after all ;)<p>>  The point is that I don't think Islam or Libya for that matter is some crooked society where the rules of law are malleable as you make out. Perhaps on that last point I am wrong.<p>I think their laws are not 'malleable' per se, I think that expecting a Western attitude towards the law in non-Western countries is simply not the right thing to do.<p>We are very 'straight lined', we believe in logic in all its glory and we like things to be clear.

Not because of what I know, though that always needs work, but because of how I think. How passion can funnel into trivialities. How unfortunate events can discourage good ideas, while optimism can blind me to reality.<p>Youth can be applied to do great things but it has its disadvantages.<p>Ageism becomes, unfairly, a proxy for determining something important: The creative humility of being able to embrace and extend new ideas.<p>The thing is: Someone in their 20's can just as easily become set in their ways as someone in their 40's or 60's. Becoming jaded and self-important is easy. Losing your curiosity is easy – boy, some people lose it by age 10. I can't stand people who decide they've learned everything there is to know about the world around them – whether they're 22 or 82.<p>Especially when selecting people to help you build something, buy into people with creative insight, curiosity, humility and passion. Those can be found at any age.<p>(Fun example: Watch a David Attenborough nature documentary from the BBC. One where he actually shows up on camera, in the middle of a remote habitat.

I don't think any of us really does.<p>However, when you say ""you couldn't be further from the truth"", is that the result of you rewatching the video, while considering the possibility that you might, <i>in part</i>, as I qualified from the beginning, be seeing her differently than you'd see a man? Or is it the result of your immediate reaction, because of your uninterruptable certainty that you surely would never do something so sexist?<p>Just curious. If you've genuinely considered the possibility, that's all I can reasonably ask. For my part, I'm happy to have raised my suspicion, even though HN obviously thinks quite lowly of this line of thought.",1318661869

It is wasteful because the hospital environment makes you forget that things cost money, and that some tests have a very low probability of doing anything other than costing you money (not saying that was the case with your family member, just in general).<p>Hospitals really mess with people's cost-benefit analysis, which isn't normally too good to begin with. I was with someone in the hospital a few months ago, and we got the strangest looks when we tried to find out how much a test would cost. Ultimately we decided not to do the test, which was a long shot to find anything for a problem that wasn't very serious, and save a bunch of money.

Using  20000km/700km proportionality of that triangle, 2 feet on tangential plane would mean ~60 feet in GPS signal arrival precision, ie. 60ns+ of time of flight (it is of course oversimplification, only to demonstrate the scale of imprecision inherently present in the scheme with satellite flying over at 20K km)<p>Very interesting reading btw, especially on atmospheric and Stagnac effect errors :<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_P...</a>",1318659872

Physics simulation is a whole beast on it's own, but pretty necessary to make a fun 3D type game.<p>Anyway, I would suggest picking a small area to fiddle with at a low level, and come up with a small project as a goal for learning it.

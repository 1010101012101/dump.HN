In it, the meaning of a given object is derived from the tags placed upon it-- and any user can place namespaced tags on any object.  The idea is that ad-hoc standards for object IDs and tag names will emerge through use.  I think this is a pretty novel shared-data concept and have had a couple ideas for it, but I'm sure news.yc will have additional novel applications. (I am a fan of FluidDB and its creator, but am otherwise unaffiliated.)<p>What interesting apps can you imagine with this shared-data system?<p>You can get a high-level idea of it here: http://abouttag.blogspot.com/2009/08/guardian-1000-novels-everyone-must-read.html<p>You can get into the details here: http://doc.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/",1258567151

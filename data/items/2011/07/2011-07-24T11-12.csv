I had just started the third year of an accounting degree, I hated every moment of every single class, and my grades had started to slip from all 90s into the mid 70s. Being a good Gen-X'er, rather than outright quit, I decided to be a slacker for four months while I slowly started doing market research.<p>By early 1998, I was ready to drop out and start my own company. That company was reasonably successful and I sold it later that year (for a price I would laugh at today, but I was 21). Most importantly, I learned more in nine months than I had in my entire University career. About a decade later, I went back to school and finished my degree.<p>Basically my friend, if you're not motivated and if your marks stink, why waste money? You likely aren't learning much of anything, so either go out and start something or get a job. Higher education is hard enough when you are motivated; it is a waste of time when you are not.<p>Just my two cents - best of luck!",1311507041

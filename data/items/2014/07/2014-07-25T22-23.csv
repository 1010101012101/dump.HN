8088101,comment,8086834,8087975,6,0,pbsd,,,"Yes, realistically you can only add at most ~30 bits of security to a password. This does not save very poor passwords, but can save decent ones.<p>&#x27;Strong&#x27; means different things in different contexts. SHA-256, for example, is a strong hash function: it has good preimage and collision resistance. However, a function is evaluated by its weakest point: when given a low-entropy secret (which is <i>not</i> the assumption in a strong hash function) and a strong hash function, the easiest attack is to bruteforce it by sampling its distribution (e.g., the most common password patterns).<p>Since SHA-256 is fast, bruteforce is naturally also fast: the average time-to-break for a string of entropy s is 2^(s-1) times the cost of a SHA-256 evaluation. You can build on this by, say, iterating on SHA-256:<p><pre><code>    def pwdhash(input, salt, w): \n        h = sha256(salt + input).digest()\n        for i in range(2**w):\n            h = sha256(h).digest()\n        return h\n</code></pre>\nBut once you get into these ad hoc schemes to make the password hash less amenable to bruteforce, you&#x27;re basically reinventing PBKDF2. scrypt (and bcrypt, to some extent) is like the above, but also uses random memory accesses on a large buffer to make things harder for specialized hardware (think GPUs, FPGAs, etc).",1406329086

8088092,comment,8086834,8087846,6,0,chacham15,,,"The reason you are being downvoted is because you apparently dont agree with the entire purpose of password hashes. The reason you cant use a hash like the sha family is because they are too fast and prone to dictionary attacks. The solution is to slow them down. That is one of the primary functions of a password hash: to provide the ability to slow down the hash computation. This is usually done with a &quot;work factor&quot; which translates roughly to how many times you iterate with the hashing function. This repetition allows you to make the password hash to take arbitrarily long. With a work factor of 14 (2 ^ 14 rounds), bcrypt takes about a second to compute a hash on my machine. There are approximately 100k words in the english language and add one number and you are already at 1 million seconds to reverse a single hash. Compare this to the sha family where you take fractions of a second to hash a password.",1406328966

The truth is that this kind of small-scale logic breaks down when we talk about large systems. They can usefully be viewed, to take a page from Marx, as mediators of internal contradictions like this. Desires that pull in opposed directions.<p>It&#x27;s in fact these contradictions that Marx, I believe, very effectively demonstrates cause ever more rapid and widespread crises like the financial meltdown of 2008 and the .com bubble 8 years before that as well as numerous global crises in the interim. He leverages a lot of historical and empirical data to demonstrate this and I would say reality has consistently validated this prediction. Its this crisis tendency that leads to an anti-capitalist position - clearly the system cannot effectively avoid disaster (it&#x27;s now struggling to even remain stable for a decade).

I realized the author is addressing two audiences, the managers and the developers, and forgot to take that into account in my editing.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve got so far:<p>Software development is, at its core, a terribly frustrating profession. You&#x27;re lured in with promises of being a lone hacker building a billion-dollar website overnight in your dorm and hear about the excitement of building a new product or even embarking on a new project for a client. It&#x27;s only later that you find out that most people who stay up all night hacking away on side projects never ship them (or if they do, they never make a dime) and that most of your work is going to be maintaining and updating code rather than writing your own from scratch. Eventually, you fall into some sort of coping mechanism such as the pomodoro technique, Agile development, or some other poor solution to the fundamental problem of the profession. The problem is that the software development industry hates software developers. It really hates us and, if you think about it, that makes sense, because we can make a lot of demands to business types that others simply can’t.<p>Recently, the industry has tried to curb our influence by outsourcing our jobs. It was thought that business could just hire seventy-five (75) percent off their staff offshore for one-third of the price and use that as downward price pressure in the domestic market. Though that hasn’t gone as well as some would have liked, it certainly hasn’t failed completely. Still, the results were less than stellar and a lot of business are now hitting pain points with foreign development, causing many of them to bring their dev projects back home. But, these businesses don&#x27;t want a seventy-five (75) percent price increase overnight, so what’s a slick talking, frugal businessman to do?<p>You sell the lone hacker myth and hand out little bottles of Facebook-style startup Kool-Aid. After all, it turns out that a lot of young programmers have an inflated sense of their abilities and can be easily manipulated into working what amounts to unpaid overtime. Only an idiot would put a young developer on an hourly wage when they could instead give him a set salary with unrealistic deadlines to squeeze the extra work out of every penny. Well, guess what? It worked! These young developers will work 50-60 hour weeks for their businesses and still promise to work harder next week. Better still, if they have a personal event or other issue, they will even apologize for that rare 40 hour week! You&#x27;ve got to love kids! You must be so happy. Look at all the value you can show your investors and how modest the L side of your P&L is!<p>But wait, something seems wrong. It’s been about a year and your dev is becoming a little harder to work with. He’s starting to mention things like vacation tim. Doesn’t he know that <insert random month here> is super important for <insert company name here> and it’s crunch time? Sure, it was crunch time the month you brought him on and pretty much every month after that, but isn’t that just the nature of the business? Worse still, he is out the door every day after his eight hours – is he no longer committed?<p>Then, it happens. Your dev up and bails on you. Maybe he gives you two weeks of notice; maybe he doesn’t. Either way you&#x27;re down a dev and probably not sure why. Well, the answer varies based on the dev – it could be family, a better offer, or any other reason. But, there is a commonality in most of these cases: on some level the dev figures out that the economics just don’t make sense; at least not if he is to work the hours that you expected.  Before wondering what happened ask yourself this: if that dev were a lawyer or CPA would you have expected the same type of “commitment”?<p>Let’s face it no business manager would think about asking for the level of commitment and self-sacrifice that is commonly asked of software developers of a lawyer or CPA. The reason is simple: most businessmen value lawyers and CPAs – they respect them and see them as professionals. The see them as professional adults where developers are just overgrown teens in their eyes. The sad part is that we allow this. We have created the youth culture around “hip” development technologies that allows this sort of age discrimination against more mature developer while simultaneously promotes the abuse of young developers. It’s time that we as software developers demand the same respect that other professionals get and end these age issues.<p>We are of course not blameless in this lack of respect. Whenever a dev shows up to a meeting in a hoodie or gaming tee, he sends the message that he is not a professional. So please give the hoodies to the Salvation Army and throw on a polo. Also, you are not a “rockstar”, “ninja”, or “code samurai”. You are, however, a “Software Developer”, Software Engineer”, or “Programmer”, so make sure your business card has one of the latter titles on it rather than the former and use the more professional title in conversations. One more thing. Keep your conference presentations PG13 and please don’t make sexual comments; that goes double for dongle jokes. If we can all act like professionals maybe we will be treated like professionals.",1406326422

To be clear, I mean this as stupidity of youth, ignorance, naivete.<p>At bare minimum YC needs to require its founders to be trained in some basic legal 101 stuff since they haven&#x27;t yet had to learn it on the job in a corporation.<p>(and hey, If I&#x27;m going to make a wishlist, add some leadership training to this, too.  If you want to make young people into CEOs you need to teach them how to do it.  Building a great product is absolutely NOT synonymous with building a great company. If experience has no value to them in hiring, they&#x27;re learning that somewhere, and it needs to be corrected by the investors--if not for the morality of responsibility to young people looking to them for guidance, but to vouchsafe their own investment.)",1406326261

8087926,comment,8086549,8087102,2,0,yypark,,,"I think the disconnect comes from having a minority group strongly over-represented, and the disagreement over what causes representation differences. It&#x27;s the inconvenient factor that doesn&#x27;t get discussed a lot. Benefactors see diversity initiatives purely as eliminating discrimination on the part of privileged groups, whereas detractors see it as unfairly lobbing claims of wrongdoing on white men, calling for soft quotas - which in this case, imply fewer Asian males in tech.<p>I wrote more about this here - about over-represented minorities, and self selection: \n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8088263"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8088263</a><p>Fundamentally, people disagree to WHY certain groups are over-represented - is it mostly discrimination, mostly cultural, mostly self-selection? Discrimination is bad, but how bad - or not - are cultural factors and self-selection? Asians are strongly over-represented - but no one says this is because admissions officers prefer them - there is strong evidence to the contrary - and most agree it is a combination of selective immigration policy and cultural factors on the part of frequently college-educated, first-generation parents. However efforts to take race into account in college admissions no doubt will tend to work against members of this still minority group (in fact - only 5% in the US).<p>Finally, the attacking white males is basically a motte-and-bailey tactic [1] in which something very obviously wrong, and not defended by a majority of any group e.g. racial discrimination, is then used, strawman-like, to strike down countervailing discussion as &quot;derailing&quot; (no one is saying racism is good). Do white men need to make counter-adjustments in order to correct for previous sins (or sins by others in the same group - see sexual harassment by another unrelated man in the same industry)?<p>Is that fair to those white men to take steps - perhaps even extending privileges to other groups at their own cost, or is it fair because the discriminated-against groups have experienced injustice? This is the fundamental disagreement in the social justice debate. What makes sense on an individual level can look wrong on a collective level, and vice versa. It just depends on your sense of fairness. The voices on the collective side of this debate are the strongest in Silicon Valley, but a greater amounts of people - and Americans overall - frequently disagree on what needs to be done to address racial disparities e.g. affirmative action or no affirmative action.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-word...</a>",1406326248

We focus on hiring lawyers for protection & litigation instead of innovation. Derivative works result in innovation. In the end, the ultimate beneficiaries of patents are the patent attorneys & bureaucracy. Hardly a recipe for innovation.<p>The little guys are at an advantage over the big guys because they are more nimble & can explore markets that are &quot;too small&quot; for the big guys.<p>And then, why are we choosing to favor anybody at all? Why not let the free market determine the winner? Manufacturing, development, & marketing are becoming more decentralized as time moves on.

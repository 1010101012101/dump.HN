Each post provides a genuine glimpse at human action (or inaction) and the resulting vulnerabilities. However, I&#x27;ve been frustrated with the ineffectiveness of the current system. The ultimate disappointment of missed connections currently lies in the fact that most posts die a quiet death in the endless internet ether.<p>Slipper takes on this challenge through algorithms that continuously match posts to people. We determine the probability that each post is about each of our users, or that a user may recognize the target of the post. If the algorithms provide a strong signal, we send the user a push notification telling them to check out the relevant post. Our servers are continuously calculating these probabilities to create a fresh experience each time the app is opened.<p>Still early stage, but I&#x27;d really appreciate your feedback.

This is a completely unexpected discovery that enables us to study a comet&#x27;s magnetic field, and how it interacts with the solar wind.<p>Here are some possible benefits just from this one discovery:<p>1) The instruments necessary to even detect this signal are very impressive by themselves, developing them has probably improved a number of instrumentation technologies on Earth already.<p>2) The lander&#x27;s instruments cannot penetrate the surface very far. The fact that this comet even has a magnetic field (however weak) is interesting.

I&#x27;m sceptical towards IDEs because they are so <i>integrated</i>. In Go&#x27;s case, if they want all the functionality of a modern IDE (at least eventually), I&#x27;m guessing they will realize it by putting a bunch of already existing tools (like a debugger, renamer, formatter, etc.) together. I guess this means that all the tools could be used individually, but also as more of a whole. And also this &quot;whole&quot; can  be adjusted on a per need basis. Go might be opinionated about the formatting of Go code, but should there be an IDE that is opinionated about the kind of editor one uses to code Go in? (Maybe this isn&#x27;t inherent to IDEs, but it seems to be what happens.) Rob Pike might prefer to use the Acme editor, others might prefer Emacs or Vim (and not just &quot;emacs keybindings&quot;).",1415813508

She&#x27;s going to make a lot more money from this than she would from Spotify payments.  Good for her; I think she earned it.<p>I think this might be the way that more artists start to go: use Spotify while you&#x27;re gaining an audience, so people can find you and listen to your stuff at no extra cost to them.  Then, when (and if) you&#x27;ve become &quot;indispensable&quot;, pull your catalog (or at least new release) and sell it separately.<p>I think Spotify should embrace this model by having a &quot;paid catalog&quot; for your music library, so you don&#x27;t have to leave the Spotify app to play music from the artists who chose to go the &quot;paid album&quot; route.

8596725,comment,8596173,8596445,0,0,john_b,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that you believe that missions like this must be justified by short term benefits. These missions are very fortunately <i>not</i> about short term benefits.<p>One of the initial motivations for this mission was to learn more about our solar system&#x27;s origins by studying a comet up close. Many engineering challenges were also overcome in the process, which will lead to positive side effects for future space missions and related areas, but one of the primary scientific questions this mission attempts to answer is &quot;why is our solar system the way it is?&quot; Answers to that question will likely help us better understand our place in the universe, and possibly shine a light on other solar systems as well. Maybe even give us a better idea how likely we are to encounter life in other solar systems, and what that life might be composed of.<p>Ironically, compared to questions of cosmic significance like these, short term concerns like treating present diseases or improving the current economic environment are petty and irrelevant by comparison. These are issues that science and government can tackle on earth, and issues where throwing more money at the problem doesn&#x27;t always help. It is a fallacy to think that because space travel requires money, that earthly needs will go unfulfilled. It&#x27;s deeply short sighted, in fact.<p>Your comment seems to be rooted in a deep misunderstanding of the nature of science. Science does not proceed by first devising a list of improvements to human wellbeing that will result from an experiment (though the grant application process in universities sometimes encompasses this task--with a lot of handwaving as a result). Science is about expanding our sphere of knowledge. By definition, we don&#x27;t know what will result, or if it will have a positive impact. But we are trying something that has never been tried before, which is deeply interesting, and which has the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of the universe. Science is fundamentally a research activity: you can&#x27;t know in advance what you will find. Asking what we will find before performing the experiment is pointless. The &quot;might find&quot; category for a mission like this is enormous, however.",1415812614

Why train more, just so they can drive busses?<p>A few thoughts on that argument:<p>Unemployment now is moderate and dropping, especially for college graduates. The lifetime income of college graduates is significantly higher than others.<p>Also, your argument (which I realize is widespread) look only at graduates&#x27; initial jobs. College education is not initial job training; it benefits people in many ways, as individuals, as citizens, as community members, as family members, and as workers; it benefits them over a lifetime. To evaluate it based only on one part of life (work), and only on a short period that also is the least significant (their first job) doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Also, looking at careers: Note that most of the world is run by people with college educations. Future jobs will become more and more intellectually demanding. What is our message to 18 year olds: Abandon your dreams, just give up and drive a bus? From people like Santorum, the message is: Your kids should give up and drive a bus while mine go to college.",1415811710

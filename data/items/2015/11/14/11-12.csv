Even if such an approach were genuinely successful, the downsides to a slightly higher graduation rate may be considerable.<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens</a><p><a href=""http://astartforteens.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://astartforteens.org/</a><p><a href=""http://wwaspsurvivors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwaspsurvivors.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2198956/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2198956/</a><p>My experience in the industry is limited to a six week summer camp.  I went through a program wherein we were provided insufficient food & water and subjected to forced march in the wilderness, with constant entreaties to conform to their weird cultlike conflict resolution framework.  To get us to behave they frequently threatened us with forced admission to their sister camp, which was marketed as an alternative to juvie, and ran on a level system (a more carceral aspect up to and including stress positions).  I became suicidal after about two days on this regime;  I &#x27;gave up&#x27; and sat down on the trail half a dozen times, but eventually gave in to their insistence was that this was self-defeating and threaten my campmates because I would merely be prolonging the time to the next resupply, and that no authority figure would do anything but try to help them.  I lost 40 pounds of bodyweight in 21 days, developed open pressure sores & lost the ability to walk without pain for a while.  I staged a breakdown in front of the nurse when we got back to basecamp, to try and get my parents on the phone (I failed). They put me in a subprogram for kids three or four years my junior for the second session.  The abuse there was tame, limited to escalating penalties when we did something judged disruptive, like make a disappointed face, until we gave in and apologized in the proper form.  Two children that year ran away, despite threats to have the neighbor turn his dogs loose on them; One ended up back with her parents, one in the prison camp.  Another (a naive and very Mormon little 10-year-old) was taken to a North Carolina state police station where the counselors got an officer to threaten him verbally with 24hrs of lockup, because his crying was getting out of hand.<p>I count myself lucky that I didn&#x27;t face anything harsher, but never in my wildest dreams would I test some child by admission to this largely unregulated the-beatings-will-stop-when-morale-improves BS.  Many of them <i>brag</i> about adopting coercive tactics invented by cults to keep people in the program, get them to conform, and &#x27;get your child under control&#x27;.  Some of these involve things a prison warden would not be permitted to do.  Mine seems to have been marketted in parallel as a disciplinary aid (one camp-mate was there on court order) and as a &quot;treatment&quot; for things from ADHD (my ticket) to autism.  The deaths that sometimes occur pale in comparison to the amount of PTSD that comes out of these places.",1447502371

10565367,comment,10562105,10563411,0,0,exDM69,,,"I agree that the use of the &quot;void&quot; keyword here is confusing. I wish it were more like LLVM IR, where things are more explicit and no values can be left uninitialized by accident. E.g. something like this would be nice (but requires breaking eggs):<p><pre><code>    int x = zeroinitializer;\n    void *ptr = zeroinitializer;\n    int y = undefined; // explicitly undefined\n    int z; // compile error\n    int w = poison;  // compiler error if w or &w is read from\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, I am not fond of C and C++ casts and their semantics which vary with the types being used (and can get really hairy when templates are added to the mix). I&#x27;d much rather see &quot;casts&quot; that are named after the semantics they use. E.g.<p><pre><code>    uint16_t u16 = 1234;\n    uint32_t u32 = zero_extend(u16);\n    int16_t s16 = -342;\n    int32_t s32 = sign_extend(s16);\n    uint16_t bits = bitcast(s16); // must be same size\n    float fp = 1.234;\n    int32_t fpint = floattoint(fp);\n    uint32_t fpbits = bitcast(fp);\n</code></pre>\nIn the two examples above, all the semantics are explicit, there are no surprises at runtime and the compiler/static analyzer has much more power in catching problems.<p>This, of course, isn&#x27;t going to happen in C++ in any kind of backwards compatible way. I&#x27;m not sure these things can or should be fixed in C++, because of the amount of existing code and the fact that most projects would never upgrade because of the manual effort required in updating the code and merging it.",1447502054

10565358,comment,10553008,10559179,0,0,sheepmullet,,,"> massive skewing of wage payments away from younger people in many competitive areas of employment, because now that the taxpayer will cover living costs and assuming removal of minimum wages there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to pay trainees, apprentices (or the likes of runners desperate to make it in television) any non-trivial sum until they&#x27;ve spend a long time &quot;proving their worth&quot;.<p>That really only applies in industries where people would do the work regardless of pay (&quot;passion&quot; based industries like film). And even then it only makes sense for capital intensive roles (e.g. it wouldn&#x27;t apply to music, software, painting, comedy, etc).<p>For most industries, in the face of steady demand (for workers) and a drop in supply (of workers), compensation for trainees, apprentices, etc will increase.<p>> regional cost-of-living differences and a guaranteed permanent income encourage former job-seekers to relocate to areas where their prospect of getting a job is minimal.<p>Good. It stops companies from externalising their costs onto the most vulnerable in society.<p>For example at the moment most companies in my city are located in the middle of town. Companies are happy with this situation only because they can externalise most of the costs.<p>For example most of the offices in my city are ~1.5 hours travel away from the poorer areas of town. But its where the jobs are. This means a lot of low income wage workers have no choice but to spend ~3hours/day in unpaid travel time. That is hardly fair.<p>Introduce BI and what happens? Low income earners refuse to donate ~3hours/day unpaid labor to companies. Companies will either compensate the low income earners (great outcome!), move offices closer to the low income earners (great outcome!), decentralise (great outcome!), or be forced into more automation (great outcome!).<p>> massive distortion of low-end wages, particularly for unpleasant, useful but not particularly revenue-generating jobs such as cleaning.<p>Actually, what we have now is a distortion of the market. BI would simply cause a market correction.<p>> a surprising amount of BI revenue will be captured by low-end rents, and other costs that people with more cash to spend at the bottom of the pyramid can&#x27;t avoid.<p>Probably not, because like you mentioned above, you actually significantly increase the supply of land and housing available because its no longer tied to jobs.<p>And if you only doubled the amount of vacant housing you would send the property market into &quot;free-fall&quot; - aka back to affordability.",1447501815

I can crank them up to errors as I modernize a codebase.<p>So the perspective you might be missing is that there absolutely <i>are</i> broken or useless parts of the C++ standard. There <i>has</i> to be a way to fix those if we want:<p>1. Continued improvements to the C++ language<p>2. Compilers that aren&#x27;t needlessly complex to implement and support<p>3. Fewer weird edge cases and therefore fewer bugs when people miss them.<p>4. A language that can be taught to you instead of drilled into you.<p>A case in point is trigraphs.

You can find GiveWell&#x27;s preliminary cost-effectiveness assessment of New Incentives in their writeup here: <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/new-incentives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/new-incentiv...</a>.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that GiveWell is not necessarily pushing in this direction yet. Instead, they are placing bets that they potentially think could have a huge payoff if done right.<p>CCTs can be very effective or completely ineffective. This is because the second &quot;C&quot; matters a lot. What the program conditions makes all the difference. If the program is focusing on incentivizing interventions that are not cost-effective, the CCT won&#x27;t be cost-effective because the underlying focus is too costly. Another aspect is what the long-term effects of the program are when the incentive ends. In our case, we are focusing on HIV transmission from mothers to infants and neonatal death. Our temporary incentives have a long-lasting effect by saving a child from getting HIV or a newborn from dying. However, if you were to have a CCT for something that is not life or death and would be needed throughout one&#x27;s lifetime, the cost would potentially be too high.<p>Some of the most successful CCTs are for immunizations. This is because immunizations are a proven cost-effective health intervention in the first place. So adding the small CCT to increase coverage maintains cost-effectiveness while achieving benefits from having a greater percent of the population that is immunized.",1447500689

Our model, conditional cash transfers (CCTs), has been used for many years by governments in several contexts. We are not inventing anything new by any means. However, our manner of implementation is trying to innovate by reducing some of the biggest challenges these government programs face: corruption and accountability.<p>For example, without technology we&#x27;d be facing the same issue as the Nigerian government (the country we work in): ghost beneficiaries. By taking advantage of currently available biometric solutions, we reduce this and increase the likelihood that our money goes to real beneficiaries. We are wary of adopting technology unless it is absolutely necessary. Another way we use technology is to collect data in the field. We are working in remote, rural areas with  high levels of rainfall so we use mobile apps to collect data. This helps reduce the amount of data compromised and also provides an additional layer of verification: by seeing timestamps and knowing exactly who edits what and when.

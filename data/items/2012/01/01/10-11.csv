The first time we met in person was 5 years after we first started working together.  We share a lot of non-work 'stuff' - most of us have had kids, so we share photos, send presents, chat about cultures (in the different countries) and when I first met the people who were working for me I knew them really really well. My perception of them in person was exactly as it had been through our remote conversations.<p>Our company is entirely remote - we got rid of our office in 2002 and we have designers who work locally (but from home) and we have other people in California, two places in Russia and Argentina. We're still a small team, as there's 17 of us, but we have a great culture. I'm just saying that it is possible to do it.",1325414242

They're always an interesting read, but I would be more interested in how you get that stuff to the GPU and how do you render it.<p>Also some insights about WebGL limitations would be welcome.

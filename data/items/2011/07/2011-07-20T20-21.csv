2787392,comment,2784064,2785030,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Criminal charges definitely require a higher level of proof but for these examples I think that a conviction is more certain.<p>In the file sharing case consider what they need to prove: they need to establish that a file not only looks like it contains infringing material (e.g. a copy of a movie) but that it actually does. They need to prove that the defendant willfully downloaded the file at a particular point with the intention of violating copyright, which requires identifying the user via IP and establishing that the particular defendant's computer was using that IP at the time the transfer took place. In many such cases the defendant's computer has not been seized and can't be used as evidence.<p>Now look at the case for a LOIC DDoS prosecution. On the one hand you have the evidence from the targeted site, which consists of server logs, router logs, and ISP traffic logs which (as above) can tie the defendant to the DoS incident. On top of that you likely have IRC logs of the organization of the DoS, these even more uniquely identify the defendant since they include information unlikely to be duplicated on another user's computer. Also, because this is a felony criminal case it's likely that the defendant's computer's have been seized. That provides an additional depth of evidence, such as if the computer's have LOIC installed, if they still have local IRC logs which can be tied together with other evidence, etc. Additionally, a DoS attack has an unusual signature in that it represents a lot of upstream traffic from a client, there will be evidence of that signature in the ISP's logs and on the client computer itself (cached dns entries, up/down traffic data, etc.)<p>On the whole I think the DoS case is likely much easier to prosecute than the file sharing case, despite the higher burden of proof.",1311195206

So bzinfo.xml is basically a flat list of excluded folders you do not want backed up.  There is also a throttle in there if you don't want Backblaze to utterly destroy your network uplink, and a few other small settings.

By getting the information in one place (a 100% solution) and having stand side by side in comparison, incubators, and their respective 'solutions' that become funded may just start sprouting up all around the world addressing issues that we may never have known existed, and have never thought to address.

In July 2011, until the official release of JDK7 next week, the latest official JVM is still JDK6, 'update 26'.)<p>Or do you know of specific NIO performance improvements between JDK6 in 2008 and JDK6u26, or in JDK7?<p><i>100k threads isn't going to beat 100k NIO connections</i><p>That may be true but I wouldn't assume it with certainty without evidence.

Though, Firebug can handle a lot of stuff that it's making out it can't.<p>For example, the article says that you have to do a lot of tweakage with the element inspector. This isn't 100% the case and I think that paints Firebug in a less than positive light.  The element inspector is a really useful tool but you're just not restricted to that.<p>There's a CSS tab next to the HTML tab. This presents the full stylesheets to you pretty printed, editable like you would an inspected element. I can often author a lot of CSS in this window in:<p>a) A much shorter space of time.
b) Less amounts than I usually would.<p>Why point a? When you can see the CSS changing in real-time, you don't have to constantly refresh. Yes, there are ways to reload CSS and I use them often but it's not quite live like Firebug is. The second point is pretty much for the same reason: since you're making the changes in real time you can see exactly what changes what. This makes it less likely to over-step, in which you could be writing redundant CSS.<p>Firebug has it's downsides, such as it's clunky way of editing with pretty printing. There's also how it assumes the formatting of your CSS. You can use it in a similar way to an editor too but this removes pretty printing. Another big thing is the ability to lose work on refresh if you're not careful.<p>I can indeed live with the above. I don't think there are many instances where I would like to add in extra assets. I am quite a forgetful person.<p>Either way, the issues with Firebug can be patched over and I'm certain can be fixed. I don't think linking additional JS and CSS can easily be rectified with this.<p>What could be missed is the publish feature but not exactly ideal in a fair few number of situations.<p>This is from somebody who has to work on a lot of static websites and restrictions insist on pure CSS and HTML.",1311192582

Not having filtering may prevent you from making a personal post that would be funny to your friends but crude to others. The author asks how many people want fewer readers of their posts, but for non-technical users, number of readers isn't a concern at all. Publishing something embarrassing then remembering your grandmother is now a friend, on the other hand, is an annoying concern.<p>There's still a question, though, of whether people will think it's worth the effort to categorize all their contacts. I'm not sure how many will bother.",1311192391

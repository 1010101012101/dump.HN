I escalated it a bit (in this case ST Micro) and the caveats came out, &quot;Well if you system is correctly designed, if the actual reset pin isn&#x27;t connected to something that is interfering, if the core is in a state where it can actually take a reset, ...&quot; This being unlike pretty much every processor I&#x27;ve worked on, from PDP-8&#x27;s, 11&#x27;s, 10&#x27;s, VAXen, IBM 360/370, Sun 1, 2, 3, 4, Motorola 6800, 68K, 68<i>K, Z80, 8080, 80</i>6, Pentium *, the list goes on. Most actually have a reset instruction, usually privileged, to force a system reset. But the difference is that the reset sequence was guaranteed to force a system reset if it executed, all of those previous processors had a company that made the processor as opposed to simply licensed the processor to a third party. Since it is completely reproducible on my system I&#x27;ve got an action item to create a small test case for errata analysis.<p>Yes, that is the code they suggest, with assurances that it will work in pretty much any case.

Because the main way Uber saves money, compared to traditional taxi companies, isn&#x27;t &quot;avoiding paying those pesky benefits&quot; or workers comp. They save money by not getting taxi medallions--part of a regulatory quota system that serves no purpose other than to artificially limit the number of cabs.<p>Note that since cab drivers can&#x27;t usually afford hundreds of thousands of dollars for a taxi medallion, they have to lease them--so it&#x27;s primarily people with a few hundred thousand dollars to spare (taxi companies and their investors) not drivers, that benefit from this hamstrung competition.<p>A lot of people criticize Uber because &quot;it isn&#x27;t really innovative, they are just skirting regulations.&quot; Well, maybe avoiding the regulations is the innovative part. It&#x27;s a loophole, and to me (not a lawyer) it seems shocking that it&#x27;s legally workable. But they&#x27;ve dramatically increased the incomes and freedom of cab drivers, and substantially decreased the price of cabs (I only take UberX, and it&#x27;s at least 30% less than an equivalent cab here in Orange County, CA). And now that drivers and customers have experienced a medallion-free taxi system, the taxi companies are going to have a hard time regaining control.",1390890440

7135624,comment,7134878,7135290,6,0,dave_sullivan,,,"There&#x27;s a bit of confusion around this, but &quot;deep learning&quot; is nearly interchangeable with &quot;neural networks&quot;.  So PCA, for instance, isn&#x27;t deep learning (which definitely doesn&#x27;t make it bad, it&#x27;s just definitionally not deep learning ie not a neural network).<p>Now, as far as the difference between PCA and eg an autoencoder (which is similar to an RBM, but different--both RBMs and autoencoders are &quot;deep neural networks&quot;)--well, PCA just learns a linear mapping.  You can stack PCAs on top of each other I guess, but it is functionally equivalent to a single layer.  So it makes certain assumptions about the behavior of the data--specifically, that it&#x27;s linear.<p>A neural network layer calculation looks like this: nonlin(Wx + b) A deep neural network forward pass looks something like this:<p>W3 .* nonlin(W2 .* nonlin(W1 .* INPUT+b1)+ b2) + b3)<p>Nonlin can mean a variety of things.  Usually tanh, sigmoid, or max(0,x).  If you remove those nonlinearities, it basically becomes like PCA, like a model that learns a linear mapping.  When you have those nonlinearities, you get a non-linear mapping which, theoretically, lets you address a wider variety of problems.<p>But yeah, if you want to learn about deep learning, just learn about neural networks.  It&#x27;s the same thing.<p>Also, re: your point on local minima--on the upper end of experiments that have been done, you&#x27;ve got over a billion parameters.  10 million parameters would be on the relatively small side.  I think it&#x27;s reasonable for there to be a variety of possible solutions to any given problem, and the whole idea is that we&#x27;re using models that are very flexible due to their high capacity.  The problem historically has been using the capacity effectively.  However, regularization methods like dropout help a lot, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to think of neural networks as &quot;feature learners&quot;.  Each one of those neurons is theoretically a feature its learning.  And even still, if you look at the features that are learned by convolutional nets (which are easier to visualize due to their being used on vision problems), they tend to arrive at similar features even though it starts from fairly different initializations.",1390889006

It is so deeply frustrating for Apple to promote a vision of the next generation of computers (i.e., iPhones) where the hardware maker gets to decide what kind of software you're allowed to run.<p>The other day Gruber posted two consecutive stories that really brought this into focus:<p>(1) Apple has stayed true to Woz's vision from 1977 for personal computers. [1]
(2) It's not surprising that Apple decided to unpublish software that used a ""non-public streaming audio format,"" because it violated the spirit of section X.Y.Z of their rules of what kind of software you're allowed to run on your iPhone. [2]<p>Thinking about Woz's actual vision for personal computers, the second story is really a punch in the gut. <i>No one</i> should have that kind of arbitrary control over our computers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/24/woz-apple-ii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/24/woz-apple-ii</a>

4037474,comment,4036711,4037304,1,0,Tomis02,,,"> I think that's a pretty significant feature.<p>The problem here is that you trade a lot of performance for stability that you should have to begin with, so in the end you have worse overall performance just so that a fringe case is covered. What's the worse that can happen if Chrome crashed? You could lose all your tabs because the default setting is ""open homepage"" instead of ""reopen the pages that were open last"", but that's your fault.<p>But let's investigate this more deeply - browser crashes have two major causes - internal bugs and plugins. What used to happen was that Flash (or Acrobat Reader, or whatever) would crash and it would bring down the whole browser. The solution is (of course) one separate process for the plugins. Problem solved. Going beyond that and fitting every tab with its own process to account for the fact that your business isn't really building browsers is of little comfort to me; you shouldn't be dereferencing that NULL pointer to begin with.<p>Opera has auto-update as well. I guess we'll have to disagree on the reason Chrome has its market share.",1338299907

Can I currently install non-App Store apps on my phone/access at a root level? Yeah, sure, I jailbreak it and open it up. Can I install a non-iOS release on there? Sure, if I have an iPhone 3G I can.

4037338,comment,4036659,4037121,5,0,joeyh,,,"return was pretty clearly chosen in haskell to make its monadic do syntax look even more like a regular procedural language. Names that better express
what return really does would be something like ""pack"" or ""lift"" or ""pure"".<p>A typical example of a confusing return in haskell is this. Note that this always prints ""hi"".<p><pre><code>  foo bar = do
    if bar > 5
       then plugh
       else do
         xyzzy
         return ()
    print ""hi""
</code></pre>
Here xyzzy and plugh return different types; since the if statement needs the same type on both if branches, return has to be used to return a dummy value of the same type as plugh (here assumed to be ()). But it only returns it to the outside of the if; haskell's return does not influence control flow.<p>You do get used to this pretty quickly, but there's also a tendency to move away from that style of haskell. I'd write the above more like this, using
guards rather than the if, and using void to force both plugh and xyzzy to return the same type.<p><pre><code>   foo bar = go >> print ""hi""
     where
       go 
         | bar > 5 = void plugh
         | otherwise = void xyzzy</code></pre>",1338298141

Depending on the model size, the target platforms are typically medium-sized GPU clusters or large supercomputers. Most of the newer supercomputers have large numbers of GPUs available and it is a challenge to use all resources efficiently.<p>GPU computing is promising, but given that it is fairly difficult to predict how much of a speed-up to expect before the actual work is done, I find myself asking whether some of the expended effort is really worth the trouble. It seems that there are two classes of applications where this makes sense:<p>1) Minimising latency/increasing responsiveness for smaller algorithms such as in a user application or service.<p>2) Doing large volumes of computation in a high-throughput system.<p>At the moment, the CUDA platform is well ahead of OpenCL in terms of maturity, features, tools and documentation. However, OpenCL runs on CPUs, both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs and work is being done towards targeting FPGAs [1]. Interestingly, Clang also supports compiling OpenCL kernels directly to native code.<p>In all likelihood these platforms will stay outside the mainstream until better abstraction layers exist to shield programmers from the low-level architectural details without sacrificing performance. Something similar to the directive-based OpenACC standard that is able to perform close to hand-optimised close would go a long way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.altera.com/b/opencl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altera.com/b/opencl.html</a>",1338297823

You choose a language to 'get in the zone with' (in your profile you have already put all the languages you work with.)  So, say you choose ""C++"".  It would flash some code and what it's supposed to do, and you put in whether it's right (compiles and does what the comment says) or wrong (doesn't compile or doesn't do what the comment says).<p>The key is that the examples it flashes exactly try to cover the code mistakes/syntax errors (even things that don't compile!) that you would normally create in the first few minutes or hours - before you're 'in the zone' when coming from one of the other languages in the list.  Things like leaving off a semicolon when coming from Python to C++.  You can be an experienced C++ programmer, but after long hours of python, you need a period of adjustment.  Isn't this the most dangerous time to code?<p>So if you put that you want to get in the zone with C++, but in your profile Python is listed, then some of the examples will be missing a semicolon while being indented properly.  If you put a language that uses eq instead of ==, . instead of +, this is brought up a couple of times.  All the things that separate languages - so that in the first few error-prone hours of transition you leave them out or forget them at times - are brought right to the front so that you can produce much higher-quality code in your 'target language' after 'zoning up.'  What do you guys think?<p>Pedagogically, it may be better not to flash incorrect code, but instead make you write the code.

4037214,comment,4036696,4037075,5,0,its_so_on,,,"actually, just as long.<p>Any set of possible bits is a valid input, so the input has one bit of entropy per bit.  If the hash were not ""just as long"" then one of the following must be true:
- it collides (two possible inputs would have the same hash)
- some inputs could not hash
- the algorithm encodes more than 2 bits of entropy per bit.<p>This is not possible by the pigeonhole principle.
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle</a><p>There's probably a more rigorous proof here but I'm lazy.  I guess something like imagine the input is going to be n bits (like 16 bits)...make an array of length 2^n and initialize them all to -1, and then for each possible input (0..2^n-1) hash it and - since the hash is not longer than the input, the representation of the hash is there in the array if you simply interpret it as the index (subscript).  Set that to the n that produced it, if it's not already set (otherwise abort with a collision).  After you have reached 2^n-1, you have set 2^n indices (including whatever hash 0 produced).  Is it possible for you not to have made a collision?  (Yes, easily: for example anything hashes to the next integer, except binary all 1's which hash to all 0's).  Could some of the indices to be empty?  No.  If you put 2^n values in 2^n holes distinctly, there is one value per hole.  Conversely, if you had anything LESS than that many holes to put it into (for example, you're trying to hash 32 bits of input into just the lower half of the indices, by creating a hash that uniquely hashes to 16 bits of output) then by the pigeonhole prinicpal you have to put two n's into the same index.<p>So, any hash that would be unique (that can hash anything) has to be at least exactly as long as what it's hashing.  If there are any outputs that are never hashed to, it would have to be even longer.<p>Note that this proof depends on iterating on every possible input.  If some inputs aren't possible, the hash could be unique while being shorter than the input.  This is how lossless compression works.",1338296625

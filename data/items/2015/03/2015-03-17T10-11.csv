Students frequently sign up for twice as many classes as one should, volunteer in two or three labs at once, or volunteer in three or more organizations. Success during high school and college admissions is largely based on quantity over depth, which is poor preparation for actual college and life.<p>P.S. I don&#x27;t mean to blame the students for the consequences of these choices. I think the administration could help by providing a clear picture of success, and providing better services.

Instead of demanding the user to understand different data structures in depth, it provides one data structure that requires very little understanding to get started, and cover the drawbacks of with a number of functions, edge case rules, and undocumented weird behaviors (resulting from different combinations of documented, but unintuitive behaviors).<p>So the end result is you got away with only having to learn one simple data structure.

9217112,comment,9215582,9215582,0,0,anon4,,,"A very small piece of advice which I don&#x27;t see mentioned here: OpenGL works in linear RGB (which is very convenient), while your monitor displays sRGB (which gives you better colour resolution due to how eyes work). This means that outputting the result of OpenGL directly on your screen is wrong (a lot dimmer than it should be). Use this little fragment in all your shaders to convert the final output to sRGB:<p><pre><code>    vec3 srgb(vec3 rgb) {
        vec3 mask = vec3(greaterThan(rgb, vec3(0.0031308)));
        return mix(rgb * 12.92,
                   pow(rgb, vec3(1.0 / 2.4)) * 1.055 - 0.055,
                   mask);
    }

Edit: Here&#x27;s a very good example of the difference <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/g6qNI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/g6qNI</a><p>Edit 2: And of course when you load textures you must tell OpenGL they&#x27;re in sRGB colourspace (most probably they are, if you created them on a normal monitor), so it will do the reverse transformation when reading from the texture. All this trouble could have been avoided if monitors were 30bit linear RGB colourspace to begin with, but that&#x27;s history now. C&#x27;est la vie.",1426588137

I&#x27;m not too crazy about it by default - my initial reaction was negative, of the &#x27;I know what I&#x27;m watching, isn&#x27;t there enough clutter on my screen already&#x27; variety. But looking at the applications, I can see a lot of value to this, even though I don&#x27;t care to discuss TV on social media or closely track live events, though I do like a baseball game and this could be <i>great</i> for sports - although again, you&#x27;re competing with all the visual cruft that broadcasters insist on slapping onto the image. What I wouldn&#x27;t give for being able to watch a game without any overlay and using my own instead....<p>From a UX point of view, it&#x27;s very good. The biggest problem is that you&#x27;re competing with everyone else&#x27;s attempt to own the TV, so you need to be careful it doesn&#x27;t become like a battle between competing iFrames, the way the web was a few years ago. I thought your platform + plugin approach struck a good balance between accessibility and power which most people would find easy to connect with.<p>Gesture control - maybe. I feel like I&#x27;d rather talk than flail my arms about. If something happens on the game/show/movie and one of us sits up suddenly, I don&#x27;t want playback to stop or menus to pop up. I&#x27;m sure it works well in the lab, I&#x27;m less optimistic about how it responds to two people and a dog or a bunch of couch-bouncing kids. Voice control might be easier and better. Better come up with some sort of privacy statement in order to forestall the inevitable tinfoil hat concerns about all the data you&#x27;re going to be gathering, and presumably selling back to the content originators/broadcasters.<p>Price....$149 seems a bit high. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unfair, because it looks like you&#x27;re actually delivering a lot of value here. But for that it&#x27;ll have to be seamless and deliver real utility, so that you don&#x27;t wind up as last year&#x27;s overpriced gizmo, especially given that manufacturers are trying to build this functionality into new TVs and consoles. I would be trying to get the price down to half that and building the business model on the data gathering - but you do ave a good presentation here, and it might be wise to price for early adopters than the median consumer right now.<p>Sorry for being a bit handwavey, it&#x27;s long past bedtime :)",1426588089

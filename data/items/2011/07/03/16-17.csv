Is there any conceivable way that could cause the odds to shift in your favor?<p>Point 2 I think could only make the odds worse for you if it involves increased overhead for the insurance company.<p>Your last point is a good one, though. There's a bit at the end of the article about this:<p><pre><code>    Of course, sucker might be hyperbolic. After all, insurance \n    is ostensibly a competitive industry so market efficiency \n    suggests that their profits not be too obscene overall, which \n    means the effective odds youre offered shouldnt be too \n    skewed. Fundamentally, its an empirical question though, \n    hinging on claims paid vs. premiums collected. I could well \n    be proved wrong: buying insurance may only be *slightly* \n    stupid, not ear-full-of-cider stupid.</code></pre>",1309712388

Hopefully you have a wife or significant other, since no single guy is going to encrypt his porn. Not sure how women treat their porn stashes; it just has to be believable. Also, make sure you don't load the porn on all at once - that'll be very, very suspicious. It'll have to look like an organically-grown stash.<p>Given all that, if you can lie well, you might be able to convince an investigator that you (as a suspect in <i>something</i>) have an innocent hard drive on your hands.

2723941,comment,2723436,2723436,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"'Probability' is a field of 'applied' math and as such is well defined:<p>The intuitive foundations went back to gambling.<p>About 100 years ago, E. Borel student H. Lebesgue invented 'measure theory' which essentially 'rewrote' classic calculus, especially the part about integration.  For the simple cases, what Lebesgue did gets the same numerical values as the classic Riemann integral.  The difference is that in theoretical work Lebesgue's integral is much more general and much better 'behaved'.<p>But 'measure theory' has to do with, intuitively, 'length', 'area', 'volume' and various generalizations of these.  Well, in probability, for probability P and event A, the 'probability' of A is P(A) and is a number in [0,1] and acts much like the 'area' of A. The connection is so close that, in the end, we have to accept that the foundations of probability are measure theory.<p>Then<p>A. N. Kolmogorov, 'Foundations of the Theory of Probability, Second English Edition', Chelsea Publishing Company, New York, 1956.  English translation of the original German '""Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitrechnung,""' 'Ergebnisse Der Mathematik', 1933.<p>applied Lebesgue's work to make probability a solid field of math.  Since then Kolmogorov's foundations have been nearly the only one taken seriously in any 'modern' or 'advanced' work in probability, stochastic processes, or mathematical statistics.<p>A good start on a good text in stochastic processes was:<p>J. L. Doob, 'Stochastic Processes', John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1953.<p>Doob was long at University of Illinois.  One of his students was P. Halmos who was later an assistant to von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study and in about 1942 wrote the first version of the still standard:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces, Second Edition', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, 1958.<p>Later he wrote:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Measure Theory', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, NJ, 1950.<p>with at the end a NICE introduction to probability and stochastic processes based on measure theory.<p>Likely the first rock solid, quite comprehensive, highly polished presentation of 'modern' probability was the first edition of:<p>M. Loeve, 'Probability Theory, I and II, 4th Edition', Springer-Verlag, New York, 1977.<p>Loeve was long at Berkeley.  One of his students did:<p>Jacques Neveu, 'Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of Probability', Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1965.<p>and another did:<p>Leo Breiman, 'Probability', ISBN 0-89871-296-3, SIAM, Philadelphia, 1992.<p>Either of these two can be regarded as a more succinct presentation of the more important material in Loeve.  Breiman is the more 'practical' and 'accessible'; Neveu is a crown jewel of elegance and succinctness but not always easy to read.<p>Other good presentations of much the same material include:<p>Kai Lai Chung, 'A Course in Probability Theory, Second Edition', ISBN 0-12-174650-X, Academic Press, New York, 1974.<p>and<p>Yuan Shih Chow and Henry Teicher, 'Probability Theory:  Independence, Interchangeability, Martingales', ISBN 0-387-90331-3, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978.<p>In total, those texts nail down 'probability' at all four corners and make it a rock solid topic in applied math.  Good knowledge of, say, Breiman is a necessary and sufficient condition for knowing 'probability' at a serious level, that is, without being watered down for 'general audiences'.<p>For more, proceed with stochastic processes, stochastic optimal control, mathematical statistics, etc.<p>For learning probability, minimal prerequisites (more would be helpful) would be abstract algebra, linear algebra, 'analysis', measure theory, and functional analysis.<p>For abstract algebra, there are many texts.  Sufficient is<p>I. N. Herstein, 'Topics in Algebra', Blaisdell, New York, 1964.<p>but can consider S. Lang, etc.<p>For linear algebra, there are many texts, but the old:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces, Second Edition', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, 1958.<p>remains a good 'second' text.  It is also an introduction to functional analysis.<p>The main text for 'analysis' is just:<p>Walter Rudin, 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis', McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>in whatever is the latest edition.<p>Can skip the material on exterior algebra or just get it from the original source, now in English:<p>Henri Cartan, 'Differential Forms', ISBN 0-486-45010-4, Dover, Mineola, NY, 2006.<p>For measure theory and functional analysis, the standards are:<p>H. L. Royden, 'Real Analysis:  Second Edition', Macmillan, New York.<p>and the first (real) half of:<p>Walter Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis', ISBN 07-054232-5, McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>Actually, Loeve also covers much of this material.  Neveu slips in quite a lot.<p>Then you will be ready for Breiman, Neveu, Chung, Chow and Teicher, or Loeve.<p>You will discover:<p>The start of probability theory is a 'probability space'.  For that, there are three parts, (1) the 'sample space', (2) the 'events', and (3) the 'probability measure'.<p>The 'sample space' is just a set of points; to support any reasonably serious work in probability, the sample space has to be uncountably infinite.  In all our work, we do some one 'trial', and that corresponds to some one point in the sample space.  The other points in the sample space are what 'might' have been our trial.<p>An 'event' is a set of trials.  We ask that the collection of all events have some 'closure' properties to make that collection a 'sigma algebra'.  So, briefly, the collection of events has as one event the whole sample space and is closed under relative complements and countable unions.<p>In terms of measure theory, the sample space and the sigma algebra of events form a 'measurable space'.  A 'probability measure' is just a positive measure with total 'mass' 1. Thank you Lebesgue and measure theory.<p>On the reals R, we can take the open sets and, then, the Borel sets, that is, the smallest sigma algebra that contains the open sets.  A 'random variable' is a function from the probability space to the reals that is 'measurable', that is, the inverse image of a Borel set is an event.<p>As an alternative, we can ask that the inverse image of the Lebesgue measurable sets of R be events.<p>If X is such a random variable, then its 'expectation' E[X] is just the Lebesgue ('abstract') integral of X over the probability space.  For E[X] to exist, we need only that X be measurable and that the integral of both the positive and the negative parts of X not be infinite (we don't want to subtract one infinity from another).  E.g., Lebesgue integration is very 'general':  All we need is measurability and not subtract one infinity from another.<p>By a change of variable, we can also write the expectation as a Lebesgue integral over the real line with respect to the 'distribution' of X on R. Or, X 'induces' a probability measure on R.<p>We can discuss convergence of random variables -- in distribution, probability, mean square, and almost surely.<p>Then we can define independence for events, sigma algebras, and random variables.  E.g., with this approach, if X and Y are independent random variables and f and g are functions, then f(X) and g(Y) are independent random variables.  Don't try to prove this the elementary way!<p>With independent random variables, we can cover the classic limit theorems -- central limit theorem, weak and strong laws of large numbers, and the law of the iterated logarithm.<p>Using the Radon-Nikodym theorem of measure theory, for random variables X and Y we can define their 'conditional expectation' E[Y|X].<p>With such 'conditioning' we can discuss Markov processes, martingales, and the martingale convergence theorem.<p>We can also move on to ergodic theory and, say, Poincare recurrence (keep stirring the coffee and the cream will separate back, close to where it was when it was poured in).<p>Those are the previews of coming attractions.<p>Note:  This material is not very popular in US universities.",1309710004

As Justice O'Connor said in Feist, ""The <i>sine qua non</i> of copyright is originality."" Hard work does not equal good or useful work-- ask Sisyphus.<p>It is wrong for two reasons. The first is that roll-your-own publishing options are available to an author, and all someone would have to do to make a profit is copy your book from lulu, blurb or whatever ebook publisher you use and post it again with a lower price. The second is that, even if republishing was its own difficult endeavor, the gain a copycat has is simply waiting for success. A publisher who spends money on editing, typesetting, marketing and binding must print a number of books before turning a profit. A copycat publisher can simply wait until it appears a book will be successful before undercutting. This is a drastic reduction in cost and income risk, and it's definitely unfair.",1309709898

It gives me great pleasure to throw $10 or $20 into the pot of some of these projects; not only because I feel it's generally the right thing to do but also because of the giddy possibility that one of them could turn out to be, well, the internet of the physical world, the democratising tool that changed everything.<p>I don't have the time or, frankly, the space to build my own CNC machine right now but damn I'd like to have one one day. Projects like this (there are many more of course) make it possible so I have nothing but thanks.

There are a decent number of people there who are really pouring money into open source hardware projects; it's exciting and has a real Homebrew Computer Club feel to it.

Suppose I spend a year writing a novel. This novel is great; it has the capacity to become the #1 bestseller, provided the right marketing is there. I go to my publisher and enter into a contract saying that I'll let them read my manuscript in exchange for them promising not to publish or sell it until we've worked out a deal.<p>So far so good. Contracts keep me protected in the world without copyright. I give them the manuscript, they love it, and they publish it.<p>All is well until a huge publishing company notices my book and starts printing and marketing it, without paying me or my publisher a dime. They manage to sell 100 times as many copies as my publisher, because mine is a small, independent operation, and the big company has a sophisticated and well-funded marketing machine.<p>This is one area where intellectual property laws, if properly designed, would protect smaller entities against larger ones.

I can sense the ableist vibe of this blog post, but in general, the ability to say, frankly, that somebody's code is bad is <i>essential</i> for teaching that person how to write good code. I've seen far too many students get away with writing horrible code simply because there isn't a TA on the planet willing to directly point out what's wrong with their algorithms or logic.<p>In other disciplines, like music (something in which I have quite a bit of experience), criticism is essential. The best teachers I ever had were the ones who were unafraid to tell me exactly what I was doing wrong. One class was taught in a group setting, and the instructor told us at the beginning of class that he usually made people feel uncomfortable, and that thick skins would be required. He had a habit of pointing out what you were doing wrong in the middle of class, not for humiliation, but so that the entire class could learn from example.

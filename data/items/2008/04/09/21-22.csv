In our batch roughly 50% of interviewees made it, and that number increased in subsequent batches.  I've suspected that the application phase is where all of the downward pressure comes in--since they get so many, and the interview weekend only has so many slots available for talking to people.  The quality of the applicants that make it to the interview has probably gone up remarkably.  This time around, pg has enlisted the help of prior founders to get a better feel for applicants (and give the applicants a chance to ask all the questions they have about YC of folks who've experienced it), so it seems likely that those that make it to the interview are even more likely to be accepted.",1207776822

159288,comment,159012,159012,0,0,tx,,,"He conveniently forgot to mention that most (if not all) ""open source companies"" do not pay their programmers to write open sourced code. Most of them simply take what's been done by others, repackage and then ""sell as a service"" essentially profiting on someone else's sweat. Periodically these companies feel a bit guilty and find ways to contribute back, usually in very insignificant ways, but most are just parasites.<p>Google, Yahoo and most other ""OSS-friendly"" companies built their stuff on top of mountains of open sourced code that they had no chance of re-creating commercially, yet only tiny, truly negligible percent of their own code is available for others to use and benefit from. In that regard you have to respect Microsoft, whose programmers essentially coded their way from the bottom (at company's expense): from boot loaders to OS and compilers and hardware drivers - they've done it all.<p>Yes, the Future is to have all the programmers sit at home and build products for free, and then take it and make money on ""service and contracts"". Why the hell not, <i>especially for Sun</i>, who's never been successful in commercial software business and has always looked at software only as a free commodity that helps to sell their expensive servers.<p>I'd love to see how these OSS-friends would react if GPL required them to publish code of <i>everything</i> they use it for, not just the products they allow customers to copy. Heck, I'd love to hack around with original BigTable and MapReduce code, I am sure GCC/Linux hackers would do too.<p>I see the very same attitude here on YC.news, when every 18 year old with a weekend project is looking for VC funding and educating himself on business plans as opposed to just simply posting it to sourceforge, just like programmers, whose libraries represent 99% of his codebase, have done.",1207776581

Trying to provide the traditional ACID semantics that people expect on a single-site DBMS isn't feasible, at least without incurring a very significant performance and complexity overhead.<p>2.

The sport of baseball -- the way it's played on the field, the way players are scouted and trained, and the way it's enjoyed as a fan (Moneyball? Fantasy Sports?) -- have been revolutionized by amateurs making use of free open data.<p>If you give out the great bulk of your data, people will be enhancing it with metadata, building tools on top of it, and most importantly connecting it to the rest of humanity's knowledge store and mining it for connections you'd have never conceived.  Giving out ""up to last month"" or ""daily intervals"" will grow sharply the market for ""real time"" or ""second-by-second"".  Baseball's mission statement concerns bats, bases, butts and seats -- not visualizing correlations among heterogeneous data stores.  By releasing their data for free they let the smartest people in the world have the opportunity to perform that second task for free.<p>We're about to enter the age of ubiquitous information.  Drawing these data stores into open formats, making them discoverable, and interconnecting them across knowledge domains presents explosive opportunities.

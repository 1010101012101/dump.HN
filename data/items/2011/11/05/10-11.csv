3199488,comment,3198171,3198702,10,0,bad_user,,,"<p><pre><code>     made, by and large, shitty products that\n     at best people have tolerated because they\n     felt they had no alternative\n</code></pre>\nMicrosoft Office was quite good from the get go. WordPerfect may have been better, but Office was more affordable. It won on merits, and although later they preserved this newly acquired monopoly through proprietary formats, Office is a pretty good product.<p>Internet Explorer kicked Netscape's ass. It only stagnated after version 5, when there was no competition remaining, but IExplorer was then the equivalent of today's Chrome ... fast and innovative.<p>Also people only remember Windows 9x and cry about the failure of OS/2, but NT 4.0 was released in Jul 96 and it was a pretty good operating system. It evolved later in Windows 2000 and XP. And it wasn't sold to consumers because consumers didn't want it. Instead consumers wanted 100% backwards compatibility - this was a hard constraint to workaround as hardware was not powerful enough for emulation modes.<p>People also cry about how Microsoft killed Netscape and yet how many people are willing to pay for their browser? Some people do, but not that many. And the Internet is useless without a browser. The irony of the situation is that many of the people blaming Microsoft for Netscape also love free stuff. And you really should do some reading on what Netscape did, because the truth is they killed themselves with whatever remained going on to live as the Mozilla Foundation, which is doing fine.<p>The thing is operating systems are natural monopolies. And when owning such a powerful monopoly, it is hard to not abuse it ... witness Apple, they don't even have a monopoly yet and are acting like total jerks. Witness Google for that matter and how they basically killed WebOS and MeeGo.<p>Is it fair? Probably not, but MeeGo is also dying because of Nokia's incompetence and WebOS is also dying because of HP and Palm. You can't blame only Android for that.<p>I got my first computer 16 years ago. It came with a licensed MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows for Workgroups. It was built by a local computer shop. It was a lot cheaper than what I could buy from any US company.",1320490630

The hiring manager may not be either.<p>As seen in a Slashdot sig some time ago, ""Light travels faster than sound, which is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.""

3199475,comment,3199095,3199190,6,0,ugh,,,"Not in Germany.<p>To get the iPhone 3GS for 1€ from Deutsche Telekom you have to sign their 60€ contract for 24 months. That’s 1,440€. The same contract costs 50€ without a phone, that’s 1,200€ for 24 months or 240€ less.<p>It’s not really worth it buying the 3GS new and unlocked from Apple (if you want that specific contract) since they want 370€ from you. It usually never is worth it, no matter the carrier. (That is, if those carriers offer a subsidized iPhone. Some MVNOs don’t, but you might still get away cheaper by picking a MVNO and buying the unlocked phone. MVNOs are often cheap and might have contracts that fit your needs better.)<p>But there is always a difference in price between getting a contract with phone and one without. Some carriers don’t add to the price of the contract but let you pay for the phone in installments. In practice, though, that’s a small difference. (The nice thing about paying in installments is that the installments automatically stop. Your contract will cost you the same increased price, even after 24 months. You have to manually intervene if you want to pay less.)<p>What you definitely should never do is buy your phone based on the subsidized price. That just makes no sense. You always have to consider the whole package. Deutsche Telekom offers a 20€ contract (30 minutes for outgoing calls, unlimited incoming calls, 0.19€ per SMS, unlimited data, throttled to GPRS speeds when you are over 300MB) and if that’s all you need you have to pay 480€ for two years of contract and 200€ for the 3GS. That’s less than half of the 1,440€ for the 1€ 3GS.<p>(I’m sorry, I’m currently researching phone contracts for my sister so I have all this crap stuck in my head.)",1320490081

I am fairly sure I would be more productive using a preprocessor that computed those prefixes for me. Real world examples of the same are the abolishment of line numbers in Basic, assemblers that know about structure offsets, the C preprocessor, and type inference. Each, I think, helped increase productivity.<p>'Power' cannot be a factor at all, as basicly all programming language are equally powerful; there are no degrees of Turing completeness.<p>That leaves conciseness. I do not think that claim would need debunking, but for completeness: if that helped productivity, everybody would use single-character variable and function names (should mostly be possible in languages that allow Unicode source code), and program in APL or perl.",1320489633

That means that there's an hour more sunlight before I wake up and it's dark by the time I'm out of work. I have to say, I don't really like the arrangement of daylight saving time.<p>Today the sun rises at 07.52 in the morning and sets at 16.14 at the afternoon. It's going to be getting worse for two more months and that means it's 4 months before it's any better than today. For a six month period most of my life is walking through these orange tunnels that appear when sodium lights illuminate wet asphalt and concrete. The first symptoms of limited sunlight exposure are starting to show around this time of the year and supplemental vitamin d has to be taken or wild mood swings start to appear.<p>When I used to live at a student campus, I had a period of ""hibernation"" every winter. I lived an ascetic lifestyle in the one square mile around the campus and the uni. I only left to go home for xmas. I re-emerged when the catkins started appearing on the willows.<p>In these latitudes, it would make sense to be in permanent daylight saving time (""summer time""). During the summer and the winter there's really no difference since the sun is practically constantly up or down. It's the fall and the spring that make the difference.<p>And if anyone knows of good software engineering career options a little closer to the equator, drop  me a line :)",1320489440

It may be a pain for users when their favourite social media site looks rubbish or doesn't even run in IE6, but it's nothing compared to the finance department not being able to run their end of year reports because one screen in their GL system doesn't render properly in Firefox.<p>And it costs money firstly to test every single function of every single app that your business uses, and secondly to fix those places where it breaks (especially when it's an external vendor's application). That time and money can often be better spent doing one of the thousand other things that are making demands on the IT budget.

Why Jack ended up with unmaintainable code and Dianne didn't? And what does it have to do with the tools they've chosen? You can write unmaintainable code in any language.<p>It sounds like Dianne did a better job of understanding requirements. Okay, fair enough, understanding requirements is important (though I wouldn't call it ""judgement""). But requirements change. They always do, that's why software has to be maintained - to reflect changing requirements. Which means that whether the code is maintainable does not depend on the code per se - it depends on <i>how</i> requirements change (unless the code is so bad that it can't be changed at all).<p>Say, if tomorrow the new requirement is to add a new API to the backend, Dianne's solution is probably more maintainable because it's simpler. But if the new requirement is to scale to 10K users, Dianne's solution might have to be rewritten from scratch, and thus completely unmaintainable.<p>So, to write maintainable code developer has to anticipate future changes in requirements and make tradeoffs based on those predictions. Now, that's a hard problem, that's where we need judgement and experience. This kind of judgement makes a great developer - mere conservatism in selecting tools and technologies does not.",1320487577

However we did not try with the same project, so it's not really the same case (we didn't have that much cash...).<p>We did see the same with admins and even quite high up (in the rankings on freelancer) ones; the same thing applied. We had an admin team which had super rankings, but their prices were insane, but we thought ok, let's try. So 4 admin teams, 8 servers, 2 each. 2 had ratings and 1 high ratings. 3 were actual teams, 1 was 1 guy (spoiler: the 1 guy won). They all were priced about $50-80/month per server for <i>everything</i> (yes... everything, including monitoring, 24/7 calamity resolve, etc).<p>During intake, the 2 rated teams performed very very well (spoiler: they do have 1 guy in their office who knows stuff who does only intakes all day, that's me presuming, but he), the other two less professional, but okish.<p>The first hick up was the highest rated company not knowing what an ssh key was. Or GPG (me asking for the public key for gpg to send over the ssh key must've sounded like alien speak to them)... They kept asking me for the cpanel root password. I usually don't run cpanel as I don't like it, nor does it run on debian.<p>This turned out to be the actual difference between the intake person and 'the rest' of the company (i demanded a total over these teams of 10 different admins) that they ONLY know cpanel. They absolutely did not know anything about linux but the sheer basics... Amazing.<p>The one person (coincidentally also the only one not from India) did know debian and was actually good, asking very low prices to get good ratings. We gave them and he's still managing 2 servers.<p>But how will ANY site trump this common trick for programmers OR admins. Yes using Odesk with camera works. But i'm not spending my time watching someone else, well actually a lot of someones, otherwise my scaling is limited to me watching someone, sit and write code. So usually the intake is with some person who is (very) good and when the cam goes off from the intake (or skype) you get some junior incapable of doing anything. How to prevent that and still enjoy the scalability of outsourcing? I mean if i have to check up on every person of my team, all day, I am better of putting someone next to me right?",1320487472

It is the natural state of affairs for many markets.  Microsoft was convicted of <i>abusing</i> their monopoly.  And abuse of a monopoly is somewhat tricky to process from an ethical perspective:  a company using their base in one market to provide an advantage against competitors in a new,  related market is totally normal, accepted business practice.  It only becomes ""wrong"" when it succeeds too often.  So how does a company decide where to draw the line without help of the courts?  At which point do you stop doing an activity that you've been hitherto commended for?<p>From a market perspective it probably makes sense to have regulations restricting some cases of anti-competitive practices.  But it's malarkey to go from ""we have regulation for this"" to branding someone unconscionable because they run afoul of it.",1320487352

Memphis TN: Obesity rate 34%, food spending $4667 (near bottom)<p>2. Birmingham AL: Obesity rate 31.3%, food spending $7109 (slightly above average)<p>3. San Antonio TX: Obesity rate 31.1%, food spending missing from list? (Or did I miss it?)<p>4. Riverside CA: Obesity rate 30.8%, food spending $5675 (below average)<p>5. Detroit MI: Obesity rate 30.1%, food spending $2246 (dead last)<p>And rounding out the top ten we have a bunch of poorish Southern cities plus San Diego. I didn't bother to look them all up but San Diego has a surprising-to-me-ly small food spending.<p>OK, so I suppose there's a tendency towards the fattest cities being among the lowest-spending, with Birmingham being a slight outlier. I suspect what we're seeing is just the well-known ""poor people are fatter"" phenomenon, but complicated by a bunch of factors such as race, age distribution (few old people are fat) and local cuisine (southern and Mexican cuisine are particularly fattening).<p>I'll repeat what I always say though: poor people aren't fat <i>because</i> they're poor, they're fat <i>for the same reason</i> they're poor -- they're not too bright, have poor impulse control, don't plan ahead, and so forth.",1274731031

This doesn't look like a big issue, but it increased the line count for a lot of cases from '1' to 3-5 ... which puts it uncomfortably close to 'dumb for loop territory'.<p>Admittedly, this is a small price to pay compared to the constant annoyance that is Java, but for my part I fear that there might be a slight tendency in Scala to fix interesting problems preferably to useful ones.<p><i>... lost any type information within the scala language at compile or link time...</i><p>How about this use case?<p>match {\n  case x: List[Foo] => ...\n  case x: List[Bar] => ...\n}<p><i>give me Scala any day of the week</i><p>Why do you have the preference for Scala?

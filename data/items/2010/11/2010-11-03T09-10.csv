1864277,comment,1863927,1863927,0,0,yardie,,,"<i>who controls the pilot's union: very senior pilots.</i><p>Most airlines are made of a lot of junior pilots. Junior is a relative term because you can be with the airline for a decade and be considered a junior. The senior pilot making $300k is an anomaly at the airline, like the Welfare Queen in politics. So when the airline wants to cut salaries these dozen (for a large airline) or so senior guys, that are almost near retirement, are the ones put on the press release as the big bad pilots. To the guy making $300k taking a 25% paycut, its not a big deal, the guy making $16k taking a 25% paycut, BIG fucking deal.<p>And just like politics, airline pilot unions don't always vote rationally. They could vote in a system that randomizes schedule according to availability, but they'd much rather keep the bid system. I guess its a case of ""I got mine"" where the senior guys get to choose the priciest routes. And the junior guy wants what senior has even if its costing him. Taxes on the rich are the same, they are an easy target but the middle class don't want it because they might be one of them one day.<p>I don't think you'll find a person alive willing to say I, with 25+ years, is okay with you firing me if the junior gets to keep his job. No one wants to be furloughed and as you get higher up in the company the stakes get higher so don't expect this piece of union contracts to change. Not for pilots, not for detroit, not even in the IT sector; you know, last hired first fired.<p><i>If airlines paid workers according to personal experience and skill rather than seniority within their particular airline, pilots would be more likely to live near where they worked.</i><p>Capt. Sully could stay in SF but there are more senior pilots who are just as experienced as him, there. To move up the ladder he chose to go to NC. Hell, even Heather Poole, FA blogger on gadling, chose to take NYC while living in LA. Your choice is either to get experience working at a different FBO, or be on reserve, sitting in the terminal, not getting any experience. Tough choice, huh?<p><i>An airline that is successful and growing will enjoy lower costs because of the new pilots being hired for almost nothing.</i><p>If you are referring to LCCs most are just a proving ground for pilots until they can make it to mainline carrier. So you have cheap, inexperienced pilots and lots of churn with the best, most experienced pilots leaving for better conditions. I'd like to point out that LCCs like Jetblue and SWA are anomalies. Most LCCs operate on razor thin margins and are usually just a few months away from bankruptcy. The good ones grow the bad ones you never hear about.<p>Also, for airlines the biggest expense is the plane itself. labor is such a minuscule part of the operating budget that if they are in trouble cutting there is just laughable excercise. The pilots, the flight crew, and the ground crew know this. A declining airline will, in this order, cut routes, crew, and then aircraft. With the aircraft being the 800lb gorilla in the room.<p><i>The author is type-rated in the Canadair Regional Jet and Cessna Citation Mustang and has more than 3500 hours of flying experience</i><p>Most mainlines require 5000 hours. For now, you couldn't get a job with the big boys even if you wanted to. Anyway, when you do cross that threshold and see things from the other seat I wonder if you'll have the same opinion. In any case godspeed with your career.",1288776282

They know to buy the cutting edge from the rest of the industry, put some software on it, and they've got a product.""<p>I read this to mean that Apples high margins were primarily due to their offloading their hardware business to others. And I only pointed out that this is only _partly_ responsible for Apples high margins. But I see that I've read you incorrectly.<p>I never heard anyone say that the 3GS was shoddy when the iPhone 4 came out. Even before the iPhone 4 was released, everyone agreed that the screen resolution, camera etc. was a generation or two behind, and most reviewers had started recommending other phones with more features.<p>Like I said, some people ""get"" or appreciate Apples product design, and some don't. The fact that you're say that there's nothing special about their products shows that you don't. There's nothing wrong with that, just as there's nothing wrong with me not wearing designer clothing and being unable to tell the difference betewen a generic and a designer suit.<p>But as you say, it makes it impossible to discuss their products. Which is why this discussion is pointless :)<p>If Apples advantage was something very measurable, for instance if all their laptops had 20GHz processors and 256GB RAM, it would be obvious to everyone, including their competitors, why they were able to make so much money with such a small market share.<p>But it's difficult to quantify what ""good product design"" is. I can give countless examples of small details that Apples designers have thought about that other laptop makers haven't, but this is simply irrelevant to people who don't appreciate that. Similarly, a BMW owner could point to lots of small features and details that they like about their car, but others simply see an overpriced car with high maintenance costs.<p>Still, unlike Monster cables, you can point to many features or details that you simply don't get with other cars that still do the job of transporting people. The question is simply whether someone is willing (and able) to pay for the added design, features, and comfort.<p>I think that Apples success shows that there are enough people who _do_ care about it, and I think that's a big reason for their high profit margins.<p>Finally, I think you'll see that Motorola has won a lot of praise and attention for some of their better designed products, even though Apple is the current media darling.",1288776155

I did it for Movember ( <a href=""http://us.movember.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.movember.com/</a> ) which is a site urging men to grow moustaches through the month of November in the hopes of raising awareness and money for men's cancers, primarily prostate cancer.

 I wrote that for this:
I don't know if this is something new peta is doing but if they just launched this today or even within the last two weeks I feel like it is kind of wrong.

Of course I see the benefit in that, but if that is their intention that is a low for this organization. As a final thought on my first post here (long time lurker), a lot of this is speculation on my part, and I apologize. I have no right to assume this is peta's intention and it is a very big IF.

Ask youself: Why didn't I understand this first time round, and what should I have done differently to make sure I did?<p>It's only by such self-reflection like that you will improve your independent learning abilities.  Here's the section in question:<p><pre><code>  An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all
  set to 0. There must also be k different hash functions
  defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element
  to one of the m array positions with a uniform random
  distribution.

  To add an element, feed it to each of the k hash
  functions to get k array positions. Set the bits at all
  these positions to 1.

  To query for an element (test whether it is in the set),
  feed it to each of the k hash functions to get k array
  positions. If any of the bits at these positions are 0,
  the element is not in the set - if it were, then all the
  bits would have been set to 1 when it was inserted. If
  all are 1, then either the element is in the set, or the
  bits have been set to 1 during the insertion of other
  elements.

The thing that makes it revolutionary is what happens when it reaches ubiquity. Mobile phones with data used to be amazing things.

These days your average person in the street probably couldn't tell you whether they were on GSM, HSPDA or Wifi (my wife certainly can't, other than sometimes her phone goes 'slow').

In practice, there always is.""<p>I was doing iPhone development back when there was only 2 generations of iPod Touch and 1 generation of iPhone. In theory, they ran the same platform. In practice, there were several subtle differences between the hardware capabilities and resources on each permutation -- and that was assuming you were running the exact same OS version, which, in the wild, is not always true. A game that looked and worked perfectly on say my iPhone would have a weird glitch on a Touch. And so it had to be tested and tweaked to run well on each. Since then, they've added several more hardware generations of Touch and iPhone, and now also the iPad, and now there are more OS versions in the wild too. Yes, thankfully, Apple allows you to build your app so it officially only supports a narrow subset of these platform permutations. But in practice, your clients/employers often want you to support a wider set. Re-enter fragmentation pain. And this is in the iOS ecosystem, which should be less fragmented than Android.",1288774857

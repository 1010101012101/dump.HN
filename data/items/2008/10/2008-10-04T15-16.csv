Then, the odds of an Obama win are exactly .8<p>The effect will be much stronger with more states, hence the gigantic difference between XKCD's result, and intrade's odds on an obama vs mccain win.  In the limit of an infinite number of states, 51% odds in each + independence would give Obama a 100% chance of winning!<p>Things are much more complex, but this is basically the point cperciva was making.  It is almost certainly true that the states are not independent.  For example, the odds in Ohio are factoring in the chance of some gigantic gaffe or a terrorist strike or whatever, that would change the vote everywhere.",1223135698

323513,comment,323482,323502,0,0,time_management,,,"I really hope Munroe's right, and that Obama wins, but I think that 91% is too high. An October surprise could drive a large move, which would make the states very highly correlated. This is much like what often occurs in the stock market. Individual stocks might be only mildly correlated (0.1 - 0.4) in general, but in a crash (or rally) the correlations converge upon 1. Elections are full of last-minute ""crashes"" and ""rallies"".<p>My market on an Obama win is 70-74. I'm including the very serious possibility of election tampering favoring the Republicans, as many allege occurred in 2004, as well as (alas) the Bradley effect. It's difficult to place probabilities on unprecedented, infrequent events, and this is an unprecedented presidential election, not only because Obama is black-- that's only a small component-- but because he's an entirely different kind of political candidate than we've seen in the past, and because we're frankly in a very different country in 2008 than we were in during 2000 or '04.",1223134953

4634325,comment,4633842,4634158,2,0,stickfigure,,,"<i>Give me all of the top music software in the world and I won't be able to create anything worth listening to.</i><p>Perhaps this is a slight tangent, but are you sure about that?  It seems daunting now, but that's probably because you're at the rock bottom of the learning curve.  I'll bet there has been more than one brilliant musician who's looked at their sequencing software and thought ""I could never write this"".  I don't mean to suggest that there's a Mozart inside everyone, but I don't see why we couldn't teach musical literacy as ""easily"" as we teach programming.  Music Engineering 101?<p>Maybe more to the parent's point, it's also possible that it doesn't require a Mozart to make a popular song today.  PSY's Gangnam Style is clever and fun but if you turn off the video and don't understand the lyrics, the music is basically sampled from 90s trance hits.  You could make a similar argument for Lady Gaga.  The major <i>creativity</i> seems to be something layered on top of the music.  How notable would OK Go be without the brilliant videos?  Yes yes, I love their music too - but there's a <i>lot</i> of great indie rock out there.<p>Maybe there is a supply/demand curve for music.  It's an interesting perspective that I have never heard before.  Also consider:  Old music doesn't ""expire"", so as new music is created, it increases the total supply.  New bands are not only competing with each other, they're competing with every band that has ever released music.",1349823385

Now they use a standard-issue laptop and some additional hardware that cost maybe a couple of hundred bucks to make decent-quality recordings that they burn on cds and sell or give away. Skill is still one factor, but the other limiting factor - capital has been shrinking more and more. So there's more good music out there in good quality and that diminishes the price. Now wether that's good or bad - I don't know.",1349823384

It's unsurprising that they're generally not going to prioritize the quality of documentation, since that effort primarily benefits someone OTHER than the author.<p>While it's great to encourage better composition by the developers, companies should also consider the benefits of hiring proper technical writers - people who work primarily to improve and refine the quality of internal and external communications.<p>There's an added benefit: sometimes it's harder to write documents for people unfamiliar with a subject when you yourself are very deeply immersed in it. (E.g. an API is written a certain way BECAUSE that made sense to the guy who designed it. He's not going to see what has to be explained to a third party, because he sees it as intuitive.)

For every time a client complains about something that doesn't quite work yet, there's a time she told me how happy she is with what does work.<p>Is it really that different in other professions?  Does the doctor always bring good news?  Are all of the teacher's students bright chaps?  Does the firefighter save each and every life?  The lawyer win every case?  The financial advisor always make a plus?  Are a real estate agents' clients always happy with their sales price?  Sure, there are lots of professions where there are rarely any negatives, say, a taxi driver, but is that a rewarding job?<p>I think this is really about your mindset.  I often feel like a sculptor... I start off with something that doesn't look at all like the final product I have in mind, and over time I approximate the final result closer and closer.  Error messages or not, to me that's just feedback, just like the sculptors' fingers find roughly hewn spots on the surface.  Is the sculptor supposed to get mad at a little rough spot on his sculpture?  Of course not, he just chips it away.<p>The one suggestion I have for programmers who are offended by error messages is to give TDD a try.  With TDD, the test failures you get are to be expected: after all, you specifically engineered them to fail in the first place.  So you don't have to feel bad about those, and you can revel in the positive feedback you get from a passing test.  And if a test fails unexpectedly you can be happy that your safety net has actually done its job!  I'm not being facetious: if you see error messages as negative feedback (again, I don't, but maybe you do) then TDD might just give you the positive feedback you've been craving.<p>Impatient clients with overblown expectations notwithstanding, but you get to pick those :-)",1349822400

And even the service side is something close to $2 billion. I suspect the amount of money they make off of certifications is a tiny slice of that. Even if there are 10k CCIEs each paying $1500 for a yearly test, that's only $15 million, which is nothing to Cisco.<p>> Of course, in the long run making them actually represent something is best for both sides of the business.<p>That's not true for many certifiers.

There is much more at stake than sites just selling email address lists.  There is much more detailed information involved.<p>Perhaps what would work better is flooding these marketers with false information.  This is what hampers email lists.  Most the addresses do not work.<p>As it stands the few (or many) people who fail to ""opt-out"" (or fail to use proxies) may make this sort of personal information sales market worthwhile because the information gathered is detailed and reasonably accurate.  It's not just a list of disposable email addresses.  It's higher quality.",1349820617

4634192,comment,4630057,4633447,3,0,disnet,,,"> The macro syntax is definitely not simple, and it could possibly get really complex for more elaborate syntactic definitions, thus rendering the source much less readable.<p>True, but the same can be said of any API. Reading the definitions can help but for both complex macros and complex APIs built today out of just functions and objects you need to document your abstractions. Macros don't change this, they just give you another abstraction axis (syntactic) to work with.<p>As with most things it just depends on how you use it. Sure you can abuse macros to make tons of crazy, undocumented, hard to understand syntactic extensions that destroy readability. But you can already do that today. Used wisely macros can increase readability, used poorly they can decrease it.<p>> And does the effort to integrate macros into the browser mean that it'll be possible to evaluate macros ""runtime""?<p>Not sure what you mean here. By definition macros are expanded at compile time (well, parse time really). The browser doesn't change this.",1349820385

4634189,comment,4632746,4632746,1,0,biot,,,"What happens when the people you love are no longer passionate about the product you're building because their interests have grown in a different direction? Now you're faced with the potential that someone sticks around only because they love the people but they're burned out by the work and don't want to face the possibility of doing what is necessary and moving on to another job where perhaps they don't (yet) love the people there but the job is what they're passionate about. There's also the issue of scalability. It's great that you love everybody in your 10 person startup, but how do you scale this out to build a business with 1000 employees? Short of slipping something in the Kool-aid, I don't think it's possible.<p>Another way to approach it is to work with people who are really competent and who you have an enormous amount of respect for. If, through work, you happen to form a bond of friendship with them that's great and you can continue to be friends even if your life takes a different direction. Should that happen, you can move on to a new job and still look for competence from people you can respect and build up that sense of camaraderie with a new team. Maybe it will lead to friendship and love. Maybe you'll not socialize with everyone on the team but you'll still have massive amounts of respect for their ability to get the job done that you don't need to feel like you have to love everyone. This approach does scale out to thousands of employees. If I'm in the same company as you, I don't have to like you but I should be able to expect that you'll perform your job competently which will earn my respect.",1349820344

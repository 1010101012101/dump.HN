Host at calpop.com<p>(I have a half-rack at calpop.com with power and 10mbps for $500 a month.  A full rack with 10mbps & power is $800.  You can buy extra bandwidth in the checkout process.)<p>3. Set up a Storage Area Network (san) in the rack along with the web and database servers.  You can just keep adding to a SAN, as users pay you buy more equipment.<p>4. Buy a monster nas to backup the SAN system. I like this one:

Sans are never supposed to fail, but we know that means nothing.  A NAS since buying a 2nd SAN would cost too much and we have a budget here.<p>5. Money: Banks have equipment lease plans, so even if one can't afford the whole price you can get into a lease.",1218427113

272765,comment,272671,272671,0,0,aofstad,,,"As they mentioned, laptops used to only be useful for sending emails, browsing the web, writing documents, etc.
Mobile phones are now taking this simple portable computing role that laptops used to hold, and then some.
Only problem with portability is screen space and ergonomics.  Somebody needs to come up with a universal way to dock portable devices (laptops, mobile phones, etc.) to a desktop keyboard/mouse/speaker/monitor setup quickly and easily. I guess they have proprietary docking stations that do this but something standardized would be nice.",1218426489

272763,comment,272671,272671,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Small form factor and all-in-one will ensure that desktops never quite disappear.  Heck, the all-powerful bleeding-edge no-holds barred desktop will always have a place somewhere.  Anyone who programs or creates content will want as much screen real estate as possible.<p>To really see a disappearance of the desktop will require a revolution in user interface and display technology.  So long as we're still doing stuff that looks like working on a ""workstation"" from the 1990s (or Xerox Parc in the 1970's) we'll still have desktops.  I guess that's almost tautological.  We'll have desktops (computers) so long as we have desktops.  (The table-like places to sit and do our work)",1218426351

What I like about that the only software the client needs is a web browser.  No ActiveX, no java, no flash. The application is basically a http server that serves screenshots of whatever window has focus.

I'm not even looking for complete regex support, even using wildcards to represent missing letters would be great, so that I can search for ""Olymp*"" and it will include results for ""Olympics"".  Google doesn't seem to support this.  Are the pages indexed in a certain way (ie, by word) that would make this kind of search prohibitively difficult?",1218425010

Which is something to watch out for in general, as it means the researchers may have been biasing their results(most likely unintentionally) to find something they could report as significant.",1218424537

272748,comment,272314,272551,0,0,netcan,,,"I think you need to take this in Seth's Audience's context. He is not writing for startups. He's writing for businesses.<p>Take Amazon (established 1994). It was a great success as a startup in 2-4 years (IPO in 97'). It got big fast. It made waves. It challenged the way the industry needed to work & it presented a net gain for the economy as a whole. 
It became profitable in 2001/2 (7-8 years). A reasonable definition of a successful business . By 2004 - 2008 (10 - 14 yrs)  it's a stable business it is clearly here to stay.
The elements of its strategy that made it successful in the second half of its life (the profitable one) are the slow & steady ones. Reliability, customer service, trustworthiness, customer goodwill, a long lived affiliate program...<p>But I agree, some of the examples he gave were probably not the best.",1218424287

A rational actor presented with information that oil supplies will decrease in the near future would adjust his behavior as he sees fit. Moreover, the market will price in the costs of continuing to rely on oil.<p>Sure, price in the externalities of oil use, but I don't think we should raise prices beyond that just to reduce demand.",1218423927

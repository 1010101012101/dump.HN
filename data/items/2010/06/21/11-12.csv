It seems likely that any of the various ""disassemble Earth"" methods would fail to kill them.

Because that's the natural way to use the Internet, and (despite the recorded music industry's best efforts) nobody has ever pointed out to them that it's illegal. They copy on the Internet like fish swim in the sea.<p>What Marak did is wrong, and I feel for the guy who had his code nicked. It's happened to me - Wordpress today contains my code in blatant violation of the license under which I published it. When that happened it annoyed me at first, but ultimately I decided to let it go because any complaint would be met by blank incomprehension.

I bought  my own in 1979, then got frustrated with how slow it was.  I hacked the machine, smashed the stack, wrote a Z80 command line interface, and then wrote a compiler for a limited subset of BASIC.  (Hand-built recursive descent. I was planning to write a peep-hole optimiser (it desperately needed one) but never got the time).<p>Then I got my first ""freelance"" programming ""contract"" to write some stock prediction code.  I still didn't have a clue, but my second project - still in 1979 - was a restaurant layout and waiter allocation program.  It used what I now know to be simulated annealing to find good (not optimal) layouts for the restaurant given the sizes of parties that were book.<p>All in 16K RAM on a 1.77 MHz Z80 processor.<p>Why not write a simulator for a simple machine that goes into a full-screen window and emulate the simplistic language and graphics of the time?

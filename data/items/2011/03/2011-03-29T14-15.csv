Sure it takes years and cash to finish that process, so it's not for every project, but wouldn't it make sense for some mind-bending idea?",1301410766

Currently in my dev environment I have a virtual host for every app/site/lib. It is rare that most PHP devs even do that. Far too often they just do FTP straight to the production server. This would curtail that.<p><pre><code>  $ cd your/app
  $ php -s
</code></pre>
That said, I think the recent trend of lightweight servers for PHP is awesome. I think any additions to PHP that introduce real professional practices to the PHP community is a great thing. In the past few years we have seen the wider adoption of Unit tests, better frameworks, and <i>somewhat</i> better packaging.<p>PHP devs always complain about how people rag on PHP, but it's because the professional programmers that actually know what they are doing don't spread their knowledge to amateur programmers - which leads to more crappy PHP code. Just like any other language embracing <i>and evangelizing</i> good standards will better the community as a whole.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2281724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2281724</a> (source link is down at the moment)",1301410242

If your model doesn't hold up well with the information you are receiving, you have a tendency not to take it so well.<p>But overall, you have the better point: if you know something, no matter what your age, it's your responsibility to learn how to present what you know in as effective a format as possible.<p>One of the reasons I like posting and commenting on HN, especially with things I know will tweak the crowd, is that it gives me an opportunity to practice telling folks what they don't want to hear.

2382818,comment,2382816,2382816,1,0,jprobert,,,"We launched Zooyan today as a marketplace where local merchants can create compelling offers to market their business and where consumers can freely search and browse offers to discover new places in their cities.  The idea of Zooyan was created to address the current issues with the business model for daily deal sites such as Groupon and Livingsocial.<p>Our model structures offers that are available for a minimum of 30 days which helps smooth sales out over time for merchants rather than the one or two day surges in customers resulting from daily deals which can actually hurt business.  We also recognized that consumers want variety and the ability to purchase offers on their schedule rather than make impulse decisions.  The extended deal time frame helps curb impulsive purchases and having many offers at the same time provides choice.<p>Currently we have over 70 offers available in Philadelphia growing to over 100 in the next week or two.  We aim to have at leas 250 offers available at any one time in each city which should provide an ample supply of merchants to discover.  Our goal is to create a one stop shop for locals, travelers etc who might be looking for something new but is unwilling to dive in head first.  We allow you to test the water with your toes first.<p>I appreciate any suggestions of comments that any of you may have in regards to the website or business model.",1301410187

2382770,comment,2381815,2382610,1,0,iuguy,,,"> Research first, and make damn sure there's a viable market there before you sink time into the idea. This is essentially what a business plan is, a documented view of the market and how you're going to make money from it.<p>I'd disagree on a number of points. A business plan is something that gives you an idea of where you've been, where you're headed and what the strategic objectives over the next period (normally a year) are going to be, who's responsible and how that will be executed. For a first year, it's largely a case of documenting what you're going to do and how you're going to do it, feeding in from market analysis and all the other researchy stuff before you start.<p>The research is a fundamental part of shipping - you can split it out if you want, I don't, mainly for two reasons:<p>1. You don't actually have a startup until you ship.<p>2. See 1.<p>Likewise, writing a business plan without a business isn't quite a fools errand, but isn't the best use of your time because at that point in time you do not have a business, and the minute you do everything will change.<p>It's great to do the research, in most cases it's essential, the things you're describing (view of the market and how you'll make money out of it) are things that feed into the plan and are actually more important than the plan, not the plan itself.",1301409509

KeepAlive can even kill your blog at 2 (achievement unlocked 4 times over last year).<p>Edit to elaborate:<p>Sorry, was eating dinner and Kindle is not exactly made for typing on technical documentation.  This comment is a abbreviated version of <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/19/running-apache-on-a-memory-constrained-vps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/19/running-apache-on-a-memo...</a> -- read that if you want a longer spiel.  (It is my most cited blog post on HN.  I don't know whether to be happy or sad about that.)<p>Basically, there are a couple of Apache MPMs available.  You may have the prefork MPM installed.  You can check by running ""apache2 -l"".  If you see prefork in the output, take a look at your config file (quite possibly /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) and check for the setting"" KeepAlive On"".  If KeepAlive is on, your blog is broken and you just haven't found the failure condition yet.<p>On my server (Ubuntu, has gone from Dapper to Lucid over the years), the package default Apache2 settings for the prefork MPM are: 15 second keepalive, 150 MaxClients.  If your server has enough RAM to support 150 processes for Apache (and, if you're on a VPS, you probably don't), that will let you process a <i>hard theoretical maximum</i> of 600 clients per <i>minute</i>.  There are many, many things you can do to exceed that maximum bound: getting on the front page of Reddit or getting retweeted by Jimmy Wales at the right hour of the day both qualify.<p>Calculation: any client requesting any file, <i>regardless</i> of whether it is dynamic, static, cached, generated by a PHP monstrosity, whatever, occupies one process for a hard minimum of 15 seconds.  4 clients saturate one process for 1 minute.<p>With special attention to fellow VPS owners: after having died hard several times when apache2 decided to use up all available RAM and then swap the machine to death, I eventually tweaked the MaxClients setting down to 24.  This means that, even with KeepAlive at 2 seconds, my max throughput was 720 clients per minute.  Again, that number is achievable under very plausible circumstances for a personal blog in 2010/2011.<p>There are a variety of countermeasures one can take against this.  One is not using the prefork MPM, but you have to be a configuration Jedi to figure out how to actually do this and still run PHP on your server.  ""apt-get install apache2 libapache-mod-php5"", which is what substantially all guides will tell you to do, will force you to use the preform MPM.  If you had been using the worker MPM instead, you would have a much, much harder time crashing your server serving static content.<p>Another alternative: switch to Nginx.

Similarly, C++ templates cannot be instantiated at runtime, meaning less efficient, more general and indirected code needs to be used instead.<p>Images optimize startup hugely: they completely remove the need for any initialization not directly related to acquiring external resources. For example, this is one of the biggest reasons Chrome is so quick to start up - it uses freeze-dried heaps in V8 (its Javascript engine).",1301407633

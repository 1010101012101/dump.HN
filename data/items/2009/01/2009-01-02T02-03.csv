(I'm a hs student and don't do much bug-shooting in code that wasn't written by me or my close friends, so I don't know if this is common.)",1230865125

416928,comment,416409,416771,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Because the money that would be paid out as dividends is instead reinvested in the company, increasing its ability to produce profits in the future.  <i>Assuming</i> that managers can find investment opportunities that exceed the return on capital that a shareholder would otherwise get, this is a good trade.<p>This is a fairly big assumption.  It tends to be true in younger, high growth companies, or companies where management is good at identifying other profitable markets to enter.  This is why Google, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, etc. never pay dividends, and why Microsoft didn't until recently.<p>Unfortunately, managers tend to be pretty poor at realizing when their market is no longer growing.  So they'll <i>think</i> they can buy growth by acquiring companies or hiring more people, but end up destroying shareholder value when the exorbitant purchase prices don't pan out.  Good for entrepreneurs, but bad for investors.<p>It's not as simple as ""dividends = good, stock price appreciation = bad"".  There's been a fair amount of academic mathematical finance devoted to dividends, and it showed that investors should be ambivalent about dividend yields, <i>as long as management was economically rational</i> (i.e. would only undertake investments if the expected return was greater than the cost of capital).  A reduced dividend just means that more money stays within the company, which increases its future value.",1230862970

416914,comment,416408,416480,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Most monetary economists would agree that a central bank's first and foremost job is price stability, after which subordinate goals like managing economic shocks can be pursued. Former Fed board member Frederic Mishkin wrote a paper outlining objectives for his perfect central bank, and price stability was his central tenet [1].<p>And the ECB has been following this. It's actually even in the ECB charter Article 105(1) - (paraphrased by the ECB website [2]) - ""Without prejudice to the objective of price stability"", the Eurosystem will also ""support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community"". These include a ""high level of employment"" and ""sustainable and non-inflationary growth"".<p>On the other hand, the Federal Reserve doesn't have a charter explicitly stating price stability as the foremost goal. In fact the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act basically legislates dual goals - full employment and price stability - which could be seen as conflicting (in the context of monetary policy).

If the business can't easily expand to handle more than a limited number of customers, and/or can't meaningfully be sold to someone else who can carry it on while the original owners lounge around on a beach in Argentina, it's not a startup.<p>That helps us to see why my consulting company, the (independent) pizza place on the corner, and your dentist's LLC are not considered ""startups"" -- and, indeed, why the majority of small businesses are not startups.

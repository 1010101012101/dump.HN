1615580,comment,1615399,1615399,0,0,user24,,,"very interesting how making an L-shape with the left hand somehow makes the imaginary space more concrete in the user's mind. You can really see and understand that the user percieves the interface as existing, moreso than if they were interacting in an unframed way. In other words, I think the L-shape is key to grounding users, it gives a rudimentary starting shape to the interface.<p>Fasinating research, I'd love the opportunity to play with it. Obviously it's very early stages, but I wonder how long before we will realistically see stuff like this in production. 10 years? Sounds a lot but there's a lot of work to be done not only in terms of polishing the technology, but also in preparing the market for this kind of interface.",1282165157

1615571,comment,1614051,1615404,0,0,kragen,,,"This doesn't add up.  If the average person spends US$8600 per year (which they do), total world marketed energy consumption is about 500 quadrillion Btu per year (which it is), then they are paying 39¢ per kilowatt-hour.<p>But energy doesn't cost anywhere close to that much.  <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/energy-prices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/energy-prices/</a> says current electricity spot prices are around US$40 per megawatt-hour, which is 4¢ per kilowatt-hour. Crude oil is currently around US$80 per barrel, so assuming 0.8 g/cc and 45 MJ/kg, that's 5¢ per kilowatt-hour.  (<a href=""http://www.eppo.go.th/ref/UNIT-OIL.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eppo.go.th/ref/UNIT-OIL.html</a> says I'm low by about 10% where it defines ""Barrel Oil Equivalent"".) Coal is even cheaper.<p>Your logic has two problems that lead to this discrepancy.<p>First, when it bottoms out in a barrel of oil or a lump of coal being bought for some price, it pretends that the money disappears at that point.  Actually, however, the money paid for the lump of coal is paid in dividends to coal shareholders, in salaries to coal miners, in interest to Chase Bank, in expenses to Caterpillar for tractors, and so on. These recipients of the money then turn around and spend, by your logic, almost 100% of it on energy.  So actually energy accounts for almost 200% of the cost of everything.  But it doesn't stop there.  300%, 400%, ∞% of the cost of everything is, eventually, energy.<p>Second, it doesn't apply uniquely to energy.  It applies equally well to, for example, cheese.  Maybe only 2% of my own earnings are spent directly on mozzarella and Swiss, but when I pay someone to do a service for me, 2% of what I pay them also gets diverted off to the immense dairy octopus, and so on at each step of the chain, until after only 228 steps of exchange, 99% of the world GDP has bottomed out in one nice wheel of Gouda or another.  Thus we can deduce that ultimately the price of everything is some multiple of the price of cheese, because cheese accounts for almost 100% of the cost of everything.  (Ignoring, as you did, externalities, the most glaring of which is government subsidies for dairy farming.)<p>A much more sensible approach, at least when looking at the economy as a whole, is to divide the amount of energy consumed into the total value of goods and services produced in the economy.  Using the numbers above, this comes out to about 13%.  That is to say, with this method of accounting, energy accounts for about 13% of the cost of everything.<p>If you want to do this kind of accounting on a per-product basis, I think you have to start by deciding when you're going to stop tracing back the value chain. If you only stop when you reach a particular commodity, whether it be energy, cheese, or human labor, then you will discover that, tautologically, that commodity accounts for 100% of the cost of everything. If you add some more commodities, or restrict yourself in how many steps you go back, or add temporal discounting (it may take 50 years for 99% of the peso I spend this week to bottom out in a tasty block of Monterey Jack, after all) then you may get a more interesting answer.  But it will depend on which choices you made.<p>There is some discussion of different approaches to this problem at <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Embodied_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Embodied_ener...</a>",1282165022

Those parents are paying for the food and electricity the children are using.  They are paying an opportunity cost on that room the children are using (they could have used it for their own purposes or even rented it out).<p>Granted, there is a certain economy of scale in living together, but you can get a similar effect by taking in roommates (I did that for part of college).  If the parents were to insist on the children paying close to fair market value for that food, electricity, and rent then the kids would get some benefit, but it would be nowhere close the huge difference you are talking about.<p>[edited for spelling and grammar]",1282164934

Initially, at least publicly, Microsoft continued to insist the future belonged to OS/2. Steve Ballmer of Microsoft even took to calling OS/2 ""Windows Plus"".[9] However, during this time, Windows 3.0 became a tremendous success, selling millions of copies in its first year.[10] Much of its success was because Windows 3.0 (along with MS-DOS) was bundled with most new computers.[11] OS/2, on the other hand, was only available as an expensive stand-alone software package. In addition, OS/2 lacked device drivers for many common devices such as printers, particularly non-IBM hardware.[12] Windows, on the other hand, supported a much larger variety of hardware.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2</a><p>The other question to consider is why another PC OS didn't come up to compete with DOS/Windows considering that Microsoft actually helped open up the hardware ecosystem.

I thought you were arguing that liberals dislike cap and trade regimes because they're market based, but now you seem to suggest that they prefer cap and trade regimes to carbon taxes. What am I missing?<p>I think lefty think tanks and environmental groups do prefer 
 cap and trade to carbon taxes but only because of implementation issues. They seem to think that more tinkering around with the tax code will not be helpful and that a cap and trade regime will have an easier time getting through Congress without getting gutted and sullied by unsavory deals than a carbon tax would. Plus, politically, calling anything a tax is a killer. And that includes policies that are revenue neutral. So they've basically decided that a crummy cap and trade regime that passes Congress is better than a good carbon tax that has no chance of getting passed.<p>Economists generally view carbon taxes and cap and trade regimes as equivalent; there are differences but they boil down to implementation practicalities. Its like arguing over whether you should use CPython or Jython; they're mostly the same and the answer depends on a lot of gritty technical details about your deployment environment, etc.<p><i>and they definitely prefer higher fuel economy standards to gas taxes.</i><p>I think this reflects a belief that raising the gas tax is political suicide and completely impossible.

Thanks to digital distribution there is now zero cost to selling these titles on Steam, GOG, or elsewhere. The definition of abandonware has <i>shrunk</i> over time.<p>In any case, I'm a bit allergic to ""abandonware"" being sold on Steam. These titles are sold as if they've been tested and work on modern machines/OSes, but more often than not there are crippling issues. This is something that has actually tainted my opinion of Valve - that they would continue to list and sell these items without any disclaimer, warning, or <i>anything</i>.",1328392768

There is also the debugger in Chrome or Firebug.<p>Also there is TDD/BDD like Vows (vows-bdd) or Jasmine etc., which if you actually get into doing that (honestly I have tried but I usually don't) that would mean usually writing smaller amounts of code and testing them more immediately (unit or integration tests) which would mean that typos and other bugs are easier to isolate and correct.<p>I think people mentioned jslint.

3552313,comment,3551747,3551747,28,0,Aloisius,,,"I was what people today might call a ""free range"" child in the 80s. I interacted with my family mostly at meals and was left to my own devices from a very young age. I was not placated when I threw a tantrum or cried. I was responsible to get to school and back from the time I was 6 (nothing serious: a mile and a half). I made and packed my own school lunches from age 8 on.<p>The line between my world and the adult's world was very clearly defined and it was clear that I had to make my own fun, but the parameters around what I was allowed to do were well defined as well. While I got into some mischief here and there, it had been drilled into me at a young age how a good person behaved and I emulated it.<p>When I tell parents of how I grew up, the reaction almost without exception is complete horror. I have had several women try to console me. One woman told me that my emotional scars must run deep and gave me the number for a psychologist! Needless to say, I don't talk about it much these days.<p>Now I don't know if how I grew up would be traumatic to other children. I do think that parents act like their children's entertainers/servants and try hard to ensure they like them or they're cool or, and this I'll never understand, try to be friends with them.<p>I will say that it worked for me and I don't hate my family for doing it. Quite the opposite in fact.",1328392736

In American english, ""How are you?"" isn't a literal question, it's a conventional greeting. The answer is expected to be ""Not bad"" or ""Fine"" or ""Well"" -- not because of a desire to sugarcoat everything, but simply because it functions linguistically as a start-of-conversation marker or just a standalone greeting. People are thrown off when someone responds immediately with an honest, in-depth answer about how their life is. It's like pinging a server and getting back a process list. Unfortunately it happens to be that our implementation of certain conversation protocols is slightly different in mutually confusing ways :) <-- sugarcoating<p>Most languages have their own version of adjacent question/answer pairs that don't really function as literal questions.

Nobody except a few large proprietary software companies (Apple, Microsoft) have enough leverage to market heavily to average consumers. Most people do not make heavily researched, purely rational decisions about what to buy: they just get whatever they saw in an ad or whatever is in the store. In both cases, thanks to the obscene amount of money Apple and Microsoft put into distribution and advertising (as well as some monopolistic behavior), the most readily available computers run either Mac OS or Windows. Ubunutu is, in large part, successful because they at least have <i>some</i> marketing. If they managed to get Ubunutu laptops into stores, people would probably buy them. But then Microsoft would go out of its way to crush them (witness the Linux netbooks of a little while ago).<p>Stallman did write some brilliant software some time ago.

You can imagine that any vibration causes issues at such small scales.  Some of the control platforms/benches are active, meaning they sense any vibration and counteract it using various kinds of actuators.<p>There are also a lot of really nasty chemicals that go into this.  When they say 'Etch' they really mean 'melt it away with a really strong acid'.  The materials used for donor doping, usually phosphorous or arsenic are really quite toxic chemicals not helped by the fact that these are often used in gaseous form for implantation and are colorless/oderless.  The acceptor dopants are at least pretty harmless most of the time (gallium or boron).  Many types of photoresist can also be really dangerous from a safety standpoint.

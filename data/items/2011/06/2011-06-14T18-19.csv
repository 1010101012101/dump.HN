I'll also add that the documentation is examplary, which is really something important in this case.<p>For the ""real CS"" (lacking of a better word) part: first, there are really good introductory book which use Scheme like SICP, The {Little,Seasoned} Schemer and HtDP (which is written by the Racket team). Second, the Racket platform support many languages like C[2] and even ALGOL 60[3] which is very close to the kind of pseudo-code you'll find in algorithm books like the famous introduction to algorithm.<p>For everything that isn't directly programming-related, well, it doesn't change anything.

If you are reading this, then you may be an ideal candidate!<p>By interning with Zannee from now to the end of August, you can:<p>- Gain real-world experience helping to develop products for a successful B2B software company.<p>- See Lean Startup principles applied first-hand.<p>- Get to build your sales and marketing mindset as you learn from Dane Maxwell (founder of Zannee).<p>- Possibly get university credit for the internship (depends on the university, but we'll help in any way we can).<p>Please note that the internships are unpaid.<p>We are looking for interns with skills in two main categories of web development:<p>- Frontend design and development. (Relevant skills: HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, Photoshop/sketching/mockups, a good design sense).<p>- Backend architecture and development. (Relevant skills: Python, Django, Amazon Web Services, some familiarity with Linux).<p>It's fine if you currently only have experience with some of these; we'll give you opportunities both to reinforce your existing skills, and to learn new ones.<p>Even you are interested but aren't a technical person, still contact us - we'll discuss your skills and interests and see if there are other ways you could contribute and learn.<p>Interested?

This has led some people to speculate that we may be entering a ""Maunder Minimum"" situation, a period of reduced irradiance that could last for decades. Most solar physicists expect the irradiance to begin to pick up in the next several months  there are indications, from the polarity of the few recent sunspots, that the new cycle is beginning.<p>However, let's assume that the solar irradiance does not recover. In that case, the negative forcing, relative to the mean solar irradiance is equivalent to seven years of CO2 increase at current growth rates. So do not look for a new ""Little Ice Age"" in any case. Assuming that the solar irradiance begins to recover this year, as expected, there is still some effect on the likelihood of a near-term global temperature record due to the unusually prolonged solar minimum. Because of the large thermal inertia of the ocean, the surface temperature response to the 10-12 year solar cycle lags the irradiance variation by 1-2 years. Thus, relative to the mean, i.e, the hypothetical case in which the sun had a constant average irradiance, actual solar irradiance will continue to provide a negative anomaly for the next 2-3 years.""<p>--------------------------<p>That said, if a Maunder minimum does somehow manage to give us a couple extra decades to get our house in order (before the subsequent recovery of solar activity), that's a godsend.

I believe expanding your site through this model takes two things, some type of reward for bringing in new members even it is is marginal because it will make the user who is inviting people that much more likely to send out invitations and secondly, most obviously, having a great product. If you have a great product, something that people truly find useful and important, user's will without question want to tell their friends. People love to be the first to tell their friends about something useful and not only do they have that ability with an invitation model but they are in a position of power by being their ""in"" to the website. The key is creating a product so great that users will have to talk about it. Also depending on what type of site you are running, because you did not go into specifics, you have to examine whether the user base is better by having more users. Is this a social network? In a social network more users is obviously better for people because it allows them to connect with more people and more of their friends. The only value in a social network is by having people to interact with so the user base would be very motivated in adding people. The same could be said if this was a skill gaming site where having more people means more potential money to win meaning a higher incentive to invite people. The nature of your site will highly influence if people want to invite other people to it. You have to distinguish your's and if its not one that is made better by inviting more people then you have to focus on creating a great product and providing users with a reward for sending you business.",1308077189

From my viewpoint,<p>1. What are the root causes leading to business schools failing at the education of entrepreneurship?<p>Most MBA programs do not have start-up teaching strategy. Most have one or two courses typically at the tail end of the program and a course requirement of a business plan. They need to have eship in program DNA.<p>IMO,a better approach may be to help form teams of students with entrepreneurial mindset and personal compatibility after first couple of quarters of the program. As the program progresses, have them focus on their startup in every course. For example, during accounting course for team projects, have these teams evaluate public companies in their target market, during marketing course, have them come up with marketing plan for their start-up, during HR/organization courses, have them come up with the culture and structure plan at a milestone in their startup growth. Every MBA coursework is an opportunity to work on different aspects of a startup.<p>I believe Steve Blank's recent experiment at Stanford is closest to my thinking what should happen in eship portion of MBA. 10-13 week course may work for another app/web 2.0 creation but most high technology startups require months of planning and that is where MBA program can work and should focus.",1308076936

Either would give them more benefit than a CS degree.  A CS degree, even if it's ""development"" focused, won't give them the skills necessary to deal with management or the business side of things.  Ideally, it should give the student the technical and theory background to be effective at any coding job they take.  Personal skills are better taught on-the-job or in non-class related, side projects.<p>I honestly disagree that there should be a separate track.  A good developer should have a solid theory background.  It should at least cover data structures, computer architecture, discrete math, and algorithm design and analysis.  OS design should also be covered, because that takes everything else and combines it into a real-world application.  Good developers are aware of all of that, even self-taught ones.  In other words, a ""software development"" degree really requires a superset of what the current good CS curriculums have, because it also includes software engineering paradigms and team project skills.<p>The real problem with programming degrees is that the industry, as a whole, is still very young.  It doesn't have a standard set of best practices to draw on, especially compared to traditional engineering disciplines.  I graduated from UIUC in 2007, and the SE course there focused primarily on extreme programming and RUP.  Agile wasn't covered at all(and is basically impossible to do in a college environment).  So while it was a good course to take for team project experience, the actual topics covered weren't that useful.  The other problem is that every development group has a different set of practices, and these almost never actually match the ones taught in school.  So while a school might teach a certain set of development practices, the ones that the students actually use might be completely different.",1308074424

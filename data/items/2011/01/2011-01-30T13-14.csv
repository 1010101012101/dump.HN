2158004,comment,2157845,2157845,0,0,yason,,,"The thing is that the human kind has been feasting the last 150 years on energy that is sort of a compressed accumulation of solar energy from the preceding millions of years. Further, it's been so cheap to dig coal and pump oil that the cost of energy hasn't had the time to really be an issue yet.<p>For any imaginable scale of human history, consider that a one-time opportunity.<p>It has been observed that the global oil peak was apparently reached a few years ago which means that from now on each year will see slightly less oil produced than the previous year. That gives the tangents of monotonically but slowly diminishing supply and monotonically but perhaps not so slowly rising price.<p>Natural gas is running out as well. Known alternatives, such as hydrogen fuels, electric cars, solar energy, nuclear power, are and remain alternatives. They're either energy containers (such as hydrogen) or represent energy production that just doesn't scale to replace the <i>humongous</i> amount of W/h that we've so far been able to extract from oil almost too easily.<p>It's out of the scope of this rant to even start about the countless things made possible by oil, but I think I should mention industrialized mass-production of food which is prevalent in modern countries. Fertilizers and pesticides are mostly made of oil and natural gas. Take away food from people and bad things start happening.<p>That means that the standard of living, for better and worse, is going to radically change in the coming decades. It doesn't take much more than a pike in the price of oil to cause financial and social havoc, such as the one in the 1970's. Maybe we'll get fusion reactors up and running in 2050 but by then I suspect the world has changed already.<p>We should start taking this into slow but very serious consideration instead of wearing blindfolds and waiting for some scientific research centre to hand over to us the alternative energy source that is the silver bullet which allows us to continue living like the way we do now.",1296394509

You're also implying the Israeli government ministers are ""the good guys"", which they are not. To put it more objectively, Al-Jazeera is an Arabic channel, supposed to be supporting Arab causes, like Palestine. Israel is the enemy here. So, network X is supposed to be endorsing a cause where A is the hero and the victim, while B is the evil aggressor. Yet, X interviews people from the B side all the time and gives them a chance to voice their views.<p>I've yet to see any American media outlets do the same. I remember a long time ago, a Hamas spokesman appeared on CNN for a few minutes, and the title was reading ""Spokesman of Terror?"".",1296393675

Mubarak apparently does and I can't think of why Bashar would be given better treatment than Mubarak.  Do you know why this would be the case?<p>Perhaps because of Syria's pro Hezb Allah stance and Hezb Allah's affiliation with Iran.

This is popular wisdom, but I disagree. That dynamic attracts different people, but a common stereotype is a divisive, intrusive egootist with grand plans. That dynamic forces good, middle of the road citizens into political participation just to avoid being overrun by the determined nutters.

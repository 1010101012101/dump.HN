Under the policy suggested (price to yearly revenue of no more than 8×), the Industrial Revolution would not have happened, nor would the semiconductor revolution or the software industry.  Furthermore, their policy would periodically prohibit trading in any companies that had large revenue volatility — except at fire-sale prices.<p>You can make an argument that these are desirable social aims, or at least they are drawbacks that are worth the costs, but the poster has not attempted to make such a case.

But you pick up the one issue that I find most interesting to debate:  what about unauthorized pre-emptive strikes against the worm. 
Michael Argast at Sophos says that such intervention ""can cause"" worse problems than the worm.
Yes.  If written poorly.  And tested insufficiently.
Maybe a legal change is needed: to allow certain organizations to have government clearance to intervene ONCE sufficiently tested.
As for the occasional victims for whom there is some unpleasant side-effect to the de-worming:  maybe that's the price of practicing ""unsafe sex"" ?   
In some territories it might be appropriate to impound cars whose owners leave keys in ignition (as an ""attractive nuisance"").

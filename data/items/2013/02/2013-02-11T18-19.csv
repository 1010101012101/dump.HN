But there really are hundreds of thousands (probably millions and millions) of sites that are structured horribly where you can simply rely on knowing how the heck to structure a page correctly.<p>For instance...<p>I recently moved a corporate site for a major national law firm from Joomla to WordPress. They had 200+ pages with multiple H1 tags, nearly 300 pages missing descriptions, dozens and dozens of soft 404s, hundreds of pages with bad titles or URLs that are too long, dozens of pages with duplicate content because of bad sitemaps, and every single page was over 100 links because of the dummy that made the original nav toolbar put every subpage in there.<p>White hats can work for the next decade simply trying to save companies from themselves, their stupid CMS systems, and former well meaning SEO efforts that are now banned or deprecated.<p>Short term effect to fixing these issues? A nearly 20% increase in traffic since the switchover and slightly raised ranking for related firm content on OTHER sites.",1360609195

When he finished his PhD, he linked up with Marko Rodriquez (<a href=""https://twitter.com/twarko"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/twarko</a>), the creator of Gremlin (<a href=""https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki</a>), and they formed  Aurelius to focus on building the big-data graph ecosystem (like Cloudera for graphs -- in fact, the Aurelius Cluster integrates with Hadoop and Cloudera).<p>There are other distributed graph databases, but most of these are batch processing engines like Pregel. However, Titan is a real-time, transactional graph database backed by either Cassandra or HBase, and it provides fast, horizontally scalable write performance (10,000+ tps) that hasn't been available in an open-source graph database.<p>See <a href=""http://thinkaurelius.com/2012/08/06/titan-provides-real-time-big-graph-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkaurelius.com/2012/08/06/titan-provides-real-time...</a><p>Combining this with Faunus for batch processing and the Aurelius Graph Cluster's integration with the Hadoop ecosystem makes for an incredibly powerful platform for building applications such as social startups.<p>See Matthias' C* 2012 presentation: Titan - Big Graph Data With Cassandra:

The insurance company can't average out the risk - either they lose all of the houses they're insuring, or none of them.

I think it's a very real possibility that this could be a pipe dream right now for a country the size of the United States. Why is it so hard to believe that we may not ever be able to mitigate Nature?<p>If you would like to draw comparisons between the US and Canada, the U.S. has 315 million people with a 34% obesity rate.

5202461,comment,5201082,5201082,21,0,saurik,,,"I would personally love to hear more about what the conclusion of this situation with Motorola was, and whether it ended up going any further. It honestly sounds from this description like Motorola decided to ""reach"" with the law, and got stubbed quickly enough that it decided this kind of argument wouldn't work.<p>I say that, because it simply isn't clear that the DMCA actually applies to the case of unlocking cell phones. It wasn't clear six years ago, it wasn't clear three years ago, and it is even less clear now after the exemption for unlocking cell phones has expired. Yet, we have all of this rhetoric about ""legal vs. illegal"".<p>To be clear, I find the DMCA really bothersome. I also run into it constantly with the things that I do (which all involve jailbroken devices, specifically such as the iPhone). However, I think we all need to be really careful as we approach these matters to not be part of the misinformation about these laws.<p>In this case, what has happened is that after six years of having a specific exemption for unlocking cell phones from the DMCA, the Copyright Office at the Library of Congress did not see it fit to renew the exemption under the rules that were established for them by Congress regarding what should be exempted.<p>Honestly, given those rules (which I, of course, disagree with! ;P), the Library of Congress seems to have made a pretty good argument, and seems to have given the situation a good deal of thought. Yet, there have now been articles blaming, in specific, the guy in charge of the Library of Congress for this, like it is somehow personally his fault. Shameful.<p>Now there's this petition. This petition is asking the White House to force the Library of Congress to do something that they do not have the right to do under the rules given them by Congress. Yes: they can reconsider the matter in another three years, but they cannot just ""rescind this decision"".<p>Given that this simply isn't going to happen (and it would be a horrible violation of our government's power separation if it somehow did), it then asks for the White House to champion a bill to make unlocking ""legal"". This is simply not going to help us against the DMCA, and is thereby a waste of time.<p>Why? Because the most efficient and ""battle-tested"" way of accomplishing that goal is to enact something similar to the Cell Phone Freedom Act that they have in Canada, and the way that is worded is ""carriers must unlock devices if asked"", not ""users are allowed to circumvent digital locks to unlock their own handsets"". This will be seen as ""the same effect, but less conflict with our beloved DMCA"".<p>Thereby, if we actually go down this route, and attempt to get this law, a lot of effort is going to be expended, a lot of lawmakers are going to feel like they satisfied the goals of the people responding to this petition, a lot of news will be printed about how they did just that, and in the end only one use case will benefit. (Ironically, not even the company of the guy who made this petition ;P.)<p>This petition also is based on some wording that has been going around which confuses people about what actually happened: the DMCA exemption actually still applies if you purchased your device before January 26th (or even if you purchase a used device after January 26th that was originally purchased before January 26th); it isn't the act of unlocking that is no longer exempt, it is devices purchased (new) after that date that are not exempt.<p>I want to return, however, for a second to this ""does the DMCA even apply in this case"" question, as I believe it to be of key important here. Four years ago, when the EFF first attempted to get the exemption on ""jailbreaking"" (not unlocking) cell phones, the opposition included Apple. Last year, for video game consoles, the opposition included Sony.<p>Seven years ago, when the Wireless Alliance managed to win their requested exemption on unlocking cell phones, there were no companies that had a stake in the matter who bothered to take part. In fact, this was specifically highlighted by the Library of Congress in their finalized recommendation. Motorola? They really just didn't seem to care.<p>> Objections to the proposed exemption were expressed by owners of copyrighted works other than the firmware to which the proponents desired access: The Joint Reply Commenters expressed concern about the potential effect of an exemption on separate copyrighted works that are downloaded and stored on handsets, such as ringtones, games, applications, photos and videos.<p>Yes: the people who actually had a problem with this were concerned with software piracy, not cell phone unlocking at all. These same ""Joint Reply Commenters"" simply tend to argue against <i>all</i> DMCA exemptions, and thereby their arguments seem to always be taken with the proverbial ""grain of salt"" as to whether their issues even apply in these matters.<p>These Join Reply Commenters did not lead with that argument, though; no: their ""killer argument"" was that the DMCA didn't apply to these matters, and that while they seemed to even agree that the business models of carriers was troublesome, that the correct forum to address these issues was not the DMCA exemption process, but maybe the FCC.<p>> At the outset, submitters have not demonstrated a causal link between  1201(a)(1)(A) and the substantial adverse impact on access to copyrighted material which they allege. The threshold question, of course, is whether it would violate that provision for mobile phone users to do what the submitters advocate, and even whether anyone other than themselves has claimed that it is or might be a violation of  1201(a)(1)(A). A close review of the submission itself does not dispel doubts on this issue, but rather reinforces them.<p>That's right: the only group in opposition of an exemption from the DMCA for the unlocking of cell phones didn't believe that if you attempted to use the DMCA in this matter, you would actually have an argument or be able to make a case. And, in fact, according to the OP, Motorola tried this argument in 2005, <i>and gave up</i> when presented with minimal resistance.<p>Meanwhile, the argument is even less clear today. A couple years ago, there was a case MGE vs. GE (yes, with General Electric as the defendant) wherein GE had come to own a company that had been doing unauthorized field service on a number of backup power units constructed by MGE, and in so doing was bypassing the devices' software protections.<p>This seems to be one of the few really big cases to go remotely high up that actually tests just how much power the DMCA has to keep you from doing things that are quite largely unrelated to copyright, such as unlocking a cell phone, and no less with GE as the defendant on ""our side"" (yay!). The Harvard Journal of Law & Technology published a digest.<p>> The Fifth Circuit held that the DMCAs provisions apply to protections designed to prevent infringement of copyrighted material and not protection from mere access to that material.<p>> In so holding, the court limits the DMCA to those cases where a defendant circumvents a protection that is designed to prevent infringement of copyrighted material.<p>(Note: I have yet to go through all of the actual court opinion from that case; I have it on my todo list, but as I tend to have my hands full with other things, I haven't had the time to do so yet. That is why I am citing the Journal summary, rather than the actual opinion.)<p>Yes: this means that in this court's opinion, the DMCA couldn't actually apply in this situation anyway, not that we really expected it to at this point ;P. (Sadly, it is my understanding that the Fifth Circuit doesn't set a very far-reaching precedent; it is still valuable to at least part of our country, though. I would love to hear more about that from those ""in the know"".)<p>What I would really love to see, then, is a petition brought forward not by a company (or generally any non-law-trained citizen), and worded in a way that causes more confusion, but one brought forward by a law student, lawyer, etc.. I would love to see this petition ask for something the White House could theoretically do, and which would actually have an effect on the DMCA ;P.<p>However, as it stands, while you are more than welcome to sign this petition, I must maintain that it 1) overstates the facts of the situation, 2) incorrectly states the ramifications of the situation, 3) directly asks the White House to do something it doesn't have the power to do, and 4) falls back to an ask that wouldn't help us if we got it :(.<p>(Also, and really this should just be assumed: I do know that these petitions are mostly for show, and that it is unlikely for these petitions to actually do anything even if they were well done. However, I feel it is appropriate to analyze the potential results of these kinds of things given the assumption ""what if they mattered"".)",1360608477

The question is whether or not there is political will to pay for the mitigation measures until the disaster happens. Winnipeg had been flooded severely several times in the last hundred years until the 1970s when a giant floodway was created which could divert a river's worth of water around the city.

Many doctors and dentists have two price lists -- one for the insured and one for the uninsured.

In fact I would imagine that knowing that the surgery will be paid for regardless of whether the patient has a job or not might make this decision faster.<p>- The government pays for top end mathematical talent in other sectors (security) so it stands to reason that if it were necessary, they could in health care as well. Again though, removing the private insurance part of the equation would probably remove the need.<p>- Obviously yes, just like any other person who requires surgery to live.<p>- Again, obviously yes. Current laws allowing abortions make this a non-issue. I understand some people are morally or religiously opposed to abortion, but we are governed by the laws of the society we live in. If that is a problem the answer is to change those laws, not to ignore them.<p>-There are any number of taxing schemes that could subsidize  public healthcare but I have never seen one that introduced a progressive tax based on health history (kinda defeats the point?). I would imagine that if the majority of the other countries in the first world can figure this one out, the US probably could too.<p>I think questions like these are intentionally meant to bring up emotional responses and generate controversy around what could be a really simple decision (either way).",1360608022

Be the guy who writes letters to his congress person and senator. All the time, every time.
Form groups. 
Stop complaining about it on an internet forum, get together in real life, and talk to people.  Not ""random like-minded techies"".  Go meet with your senators or congressmen. They take meetings from constituents.  You'll probably end up talking to an LA or something, but if you <i>all</i> do it, it'll start to have an impact.  Tell them exactly how much money you are spending, and how much time you are wasting, worrying about this stuff.  Form lobbying groups, and advocate.<p>There are other effective things than the above, it's just an example.<p>One of the reasons I became a lawyer, instead of just a software engineer, is because it was clear to me, even 15 years ago, that patents were going to destroy our industry.<p>It was also clear that the majority of software engineers would do one of three things:<p>1. Pretend it did not matter.<p>2. Dismiss the threat until it became huge.<p>3. Complain about it on Usenet (now ""random blogs, internet forums, and social media sites"").<p>It took a long time to get to the point it is now.
It will, realistically, take a long time to get to a better point.  Yes, everyone has a quick fix solution, like ""ban software patents"" or ""pray the federal circuit/supreme court saves us from years of bad policy and legal decisions"".  These are all long shots. They may happen. But it's all short term plays.  You need the long term play as well, in the background, in case these don't work out.<p>People have this weird idea that the content industry/etc simply backed up a truck of money to congress people and got the laws they wanted.  Instead, they spend 20+ years meeting with politicians, advocating their position, forming lobbying groups, and slowly winning politicians over. They showed (mostly fake) economic benefit, had studies done, kept harping them over and over.  Certainly they donated, but if you think it was simply because they gave some congressman some money, you don't understand how things get done.<p>If you want to stop software patents, you need to take this long term approach as well.  Don't get me wrong, I hope the supreme court reigns in the federal circuit as well.

4. Poking around for reasons, you discover that your website ranks really lowly on Google.
5. You have no idea why.
6. You pay an SEO consultant. They take a look at your web site, and your overall web presence, to try and find out what's going wrong.
7. They discover that your markup is terrible, the wrong things are enclosed in header tags, etc. Also, you have little to no visibility outside of your website.
8. They advise some sensible changes to your markup, and force you to start posting things on Google+, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
9. Your ranking improves.

Also the only way to move water in and sewage out past a certain size (again until the 19th-20th century).<p>So big cities grew around big waterways, whether inland or at the mouth, and big cities act as black hole, they have a ""mass"" attracting more people and growing bigger out of it.<p>And big waterways flood, so you end up with the places which have been the most likely to accumulate huge populations over historical times also being those most likely to get flooded.<p>To fix that, you have to tear down and remove cities with hundreds of thousands of years of history, social accretion structure and huge populations.<p>Not really easy.<p>And that's before you factor in the costs of creating a complete mature metropolis from scratch, and you start wondering about the location: coasts are out (storms, tsunamis); waterway plains are out (floods); geologically active zones are out (quakes, volcano eruptions); periodically dry places with vegetation are out (fires and firestorms); space is out obviously (hard life support system dependency, no ringworld for you).<p>You're pretty much left with deserts, big mountain ranges and waterworld.",1360606799

5202174,comment,5201695,5202029,1,0,bmmayer1,,,"Insurance is a really terrible way to pay for any commodity.  If I paid a fixed price to go to the grocery store every month and get everything I needed off the shelves, the grocery store would go bankrupt.  Obviously, insurance works for event that are unlikely, as a way to mitigate risk.  But everyone dies eventually.  Everyone will need healthcare.<p>Because of the nature of insurance, it drives up prices, it misaligns incentives, and our particular mode of insurance--subsidized employer-provided insurance--has the added injury of forcing people to stay in their jobs for the sake of their health and limiting mobility.<p>Yet, not only do we accept insurance as the best way to pay for healthcare today, we just doubled down on it with Obamacare, requiring people who previously weren't in the insurance market to participate.<p>My solution is to let healthcare be another commodity, like food, where there is widespread competition and choice, and thus lower prices and more transparency.<p>With your example, it's not like someone makes a choice in emergency care right now either.  But at least you could establish a relationship with a hospital ahead of time.  How about an app that lets you join a hospital network for emergencies?  What about an annuity plan that lets you save up for a lung transplant ahead of time if/when you need it?  I don't know what health entrepreneurs would come up with.  But there are solutions out there that will never be tried as long as insurance companies have a stranglehold on the health industry.",1360606011

5202161,comment,5201695,5201986,3,0,kevingadd,,,"There's a lot more wrong with American health care than prices. I know a lot of people who simply can't get insurance in the US at any price because of how the market works - and some of them are in great health and have been forever. It's actually quite close to raganwald's 'flood plain' example, where the insurers will outright refuse or quote impossible rates.<p>And, as it happens, I can't buy insurance on the free market anymore either. I've never been hospitalized or needed surgery or been injured, so I used to get pretty affordable insurance and have no problem paying out of pocket. Then I saw a therapist and that was enough for every insurer I've contacted since to blanket refuse to insure me at any rate. According to the state agencies that regulate this stuff, that's how the system is supposed to work.<p>Now, you could say that this is how an insurance market should work - maybe the reason people like me can't buy insurance at any price on the free market is because it's not possible to turn a profit by insuring us, statistically, even if individually we are incredibly healthy and pay a ton. I can buy that explanation. But do you think it's morally right for people to be unable to access basic preventative care at reasonable cost, and be unable to afford emergency care, just because statistically 5-10% of the people in their group are expensive?<p>I think it's also worth considering the counter-example: group health in the US is comparatively quite sane. If your employer has a reasonable group health plan, you can count on having basic coverage, even if a pre-existing condition gets excluded for a bit when you first enter the plan. The employer's overall cost for the group might go up, but that's about it. A friend of mine found out that his company's rate for group health was nearly $2000/mo - apparently they had lots of high risk employees - but my past employer's group health rate, in comparison, was around $400/mo for good coverage.",1360605874

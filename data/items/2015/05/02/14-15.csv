The game has changed completely for me, as it&#x27;s about 50/50 that I will survive the first 20 seconds. It&#x27;s gotten extremely tight in there and there&#x27;s no more room to maneuver. If you&#x27;re a big cell, it&#x27;s almost impossible to die, as there is now always a stream of little guys that get trapped, then sucked in.<p>I really had a lot of fun &quot;exploring&quot; the worlds and occasionally bumping into another cell, or just crossing paths yesterday. I could go on long chases that would last a few minutes, which was a lot of fun. As of now (I tried the 4 regions), it&#x27;s basically a reflex game. Splitting in half to &quot;attack&quot; I think is the cornerstone of this game (if you want to get big, you have to risk a bit), but it&#x27;s so crowded now that it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive/risky to do so, which sucks.<p>A small thing to consider for user retention: if I&#x27;ve carefully built up my cell to a respectable size, I will try to play smart and not leave my computer, grab water, go to the washroom, because I&#x27;m invested. If I die every 3 minutes, it&#x27;s easy for me to drop it, forget about it and move on. I spent 60-90 minutes in a single game yesterday, and didn&#x27;t want to &quot;lose my work&quot;, if you see what I mean.<p>Awesome work (I think the small upgrades on the theme, names, etc. is awesome), keep iterating - but I think I&#x27;m going to get back to productive stuff now, because the game has lost most of its appeal to me.",1430578787

A urinary tract infection that wouldn&#x27;t go away, even after a couple of months of antibiotics (first one I don&#x27;t remember, then cipro). Ejaculation would sometimes make it feel better. Sometimes worse. Finally saw a urologist that said he didn&#x27;t believe it was caused by infection and that I should try pelvic floor Physio therapy. After the first week I felt so much better that I was convinced.<p>Whenenver I see someone mention it now I try to preach the physio gospel because when I was going through it there were a lot of negative sufferers posting to message boards saying it will never go away, etc.<p>Also women can suffer from a similar condition - chronic non bacterial urinary tract infections, and most of the pelvic floor physiotherapists are used to dealing with women.

Displacing it because a writer at TechCrunch thinks C sucks and Rust is better is a different kind of fallacy. I&#x27;d be happy to see a safer language that didn&#x27;t sacrifice expressive power, performance, and memory footprint. Many, many candidates have been floated since C made its debut, so either they have all been found wanting, or the obstacles to moving beyond C are bigger than just inventing a safer language.

A more useful dialogue would be along the lines of &quot;Death to C where it is inappropriate&quot;, but C isn&#x27;t used much these days where it&#x27;s the wrong tool for the job. Mostly, C is used for the things that C does very well. Maybe we&#x27;d agree on &quot;Death to C++ where it&#x27;s inappropriate&quot;, because C++ is much more often used (than C) where it isn&#x27;t appropriate. Then we have to go down the rabbit hole of <i>why</i> C++ often sucks, and we realize that it&#x27;s not even that it&#x27;s a bad language itself (not that it&#x27;s great, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be horrible) so much as object-oriented programming (OOP) has been bastardized by business, and misused by reactively-writing programmers under tight deadlines, to create obfuscation. Then we realize that this problem is even more severe in Java codebases. Then we wonder if a new language can really fix a problem (code quality) that is partially sociological and political...<p>The counterexample to the &quot;C is unsafe&quot; argument is that C is what people use for extremely high-reliability programming. I prefer Haskell, and Rust is promising, but the fact is that JPL uses C. The Mars Rover is probably running C code.

It&#x27;s not an American thing, we have it in Europe too, and, I&#x27;m sure round the world. It&#x27;s just down to statistics and innate human behaviour. When we have high-profile cases like this, we have a choice of saying &#x27;it&#x27;s a shame someone else died at the hands of some police, let&#x27;s put them on desk duty&#x27; or saying &#x27;is this systemic? how many days until it happens again?&#x27;.<p>Unless we tackle that, we&#x27;re always going to have abuses.

What they&#x27;re really saying is, &quot;I think that, based on some linear combination of pre-existing socioeconomic resources and inflated self-image, I have the right to a job where I tell other people what to do.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that all MBAs are douchebags. I know plenty whom I like a lot. Unfortunately, the culture of business school and <i>especially</i> the elite business schools is one of entitlement and position-seeking. When that type of person founds a startup, you get a lot of the same toxic big-company behaviors and formalities and political structures, but in a small company that can&#x27;t afford the inefficiencies. Now you have the worst of both worlds between small companies and big ones, and a high likelihood of failure or, if the connections are there, Knewton-esque mediocrity.<p>Oddly enough, if I had a child I&#x27;d recommend that he go to the highest-ranking business school out there. Harvard is going to open doors that are just ridiculous, whereas the #20 school is probably educationally equivalent, but isn&#x27;t going to make you a CEO at 30. On the other hand, if I were hiring, I&#x27;d be extremely skeptical of the Harvard MBA and less skeptical of the Booth MBA and even less skeptical of the UWash MBA. In most educational divisions, the correlation between prestige and douchebaggery is nonexistent, i.e. Yale law students aren&#x27;t noticeably douchier, or less douchey, than students at middling schools; in MBA school, it&#x27;s clearly a positive correlation (although Stanford is probably worse than Harvard, though less prestigious, for obvious reasons).",1430577058

As soon as a viable replacement for it comes, I&#x27;m going to get drunk, ritually burn K&R&#x27;s &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; then get drunk again. But I&#x27;ve been waiting for that day for a long, long, long time, and there&#x27;s still no sign of it, not even with Rust (<i>maybe</i> with Go but we&#x27;ll have to see).<p>I cannot think of a single systems programming language that has not vowed to put an end to all this buffer overflow and dangling pointers mess. The ones I tried so far (I think there&#x27;s a dozen...) failed because of at least of one of the following items:<p>* Some of them mainly achieve safety by forbidding any unsafe read or write -- and then when you <i>have</i> to do a read or a write, they implement that by cleverly eschewing a protection mechanism or by isolating everything in an unsafe area. The former is disastrous because you can have bugs that eschew the protection mechanisms, too (see Heartbleed -- which can be <i>perfectly</i> replicated in Rust or Go); the latter, while useful in most application software, is next to useless in my day to day activity, where I have entire <i>modules</i> that consist of nothing other than unsafe reads or writes. At that point I might as well be using C.<p>* Others mainly achieve safety through a complicated system of annotations (&quot;this parameter must not be NULL&quot;) or a type system that makes certain guarantees (&quot;these parameter can never be NULL&quot;). The end result is a system of annotations and/or types which you can describe in about as much space as The C Programming Languages takes to describe the whole language. Barring the fact that my memory is limited after ingesting C++, real life experience shows that &quot;more complexity&quot; is how bugs get introduced, rather than resolved. Except that the new problems don&#x27;t arise because a pointer is pointing where it shouldn&#x27;t, but rather because 1 == 1 returns False for certain types of 1 or something.<p>* Aaand some of them simply delude themselves through clever sandboxing and protected writes, ignoring the fact that the sandboxing back-end is C all the way and can be exploited. Except it&#x27;s so mind-boggingly complex that fixing it is incredibly complicated.<p>Historically, there have been many instances of <i>operating systems</i> written in high-level (ish) languages. Hell, there are operating systems written in Common Lisp. It can be done. People haven&#x27;t flocked towards high-level languages despite 30 bloody years, if not more, of operating systems written in high-level languages because it turns out you usually can&#x27;t do it unless you turn most of those fancy protection features off. At which point you end up with C, only with a more complicated syntax, and why the hell bother?<p>The key to writing secure software that doesn&#x27;t crash <i>is still</i> in correct programming. Tooling can help, but no language, no matter how fancy and hand-holding, is going to compensate for that.",1430576299

Except for hobbyists and academics, software is not written with advance knowledge of every eventuality. From a business point of view good software adapts to change. Those adaptations may make the code more &quot;legacy&quot; or icky to future developers, but it&#x27;s always a cost/benefit tradeoff.<p>Software is not the only technology that turns legacy and needs refactoring. Have you ever done a significant remodel on a kitchen or bathroom? Did you curse the original plumbers and electricians for not anticipating you would tear a wall out and move the sink? No. You factor those costs into the job, expecting that some things will not be as easy as they first appear. If you hired a contractor to remodel your bathroom and he saw &quot;legacy&quot; plumbing that made the job harder, would you let him tear the house down and start over?<p>Programmers tend to think of software very narrowly: the things they value are performance, an abstract notion of elegance, how impressed their peers will be by the code. They may try to anticipate future requirements but they risk violating the YAGNI principle if they get carried away (to say nothing of overrunning the budget and schedule).<p>The people who pay for and use software have a different set of requirements. In most real businesses the data that runs the business, usually living in a relational database management system, has more long-term value than the application software. Data has a longer lifespan than software in most applications, too. Yet many programmers who bang the &quot;legacy code is shit&quot; drum give very little thought to data integrity or the long lifespan of critical business data.<p>Sometimes legacy code is crap that has outlived its usefulness, and is now too expensive or dangerous to keep tinkering with. More often the legacy code works and isn&#x27;t really that bad, even if it uses spaces instead of tabs, or has funky variable names, or isn&#x27;t written in a cool language. Programmers need to step back from their own fashions and prejudices and spend some time figuring out the legacy code and how to fix and refactor it. Almost all of my consulting clients come to me after they&#x27;ve been told by three or four other consultants that their code is so bad it has to be thrown out and rewritten (in some cool new language). That is almost never necessary in my experience.<p>I&#x27;ve written more about maintenance programming on my blog.",1430576268

So these are thoughts from a Rust newbie (which I still think can be valuable):<p>Pros:<p>- Pattern matching is beautiful, and is one of the things I miss most when not working in Racket.<p>- I love their static typing. I think they hit a sweet spot with type inference inside of functions but required types to be specified as parameters (too much inference can make it hard to know exactly what type something is, too little inference means I spend all my time writing type signatures).<p>- Borrowing and lifetimes are neat and have helped me avoid some lifetime-related bugs.<p>- Being able to call Rust code from C is a huge win, and I think this world needs more &quot;systems-level&quot; languages than C and C++.<p>Cons:<p>- Borrowing and lifetimes. This is actually is a huge pro, but sometimes the compiler can spot a lifetime issue that I don&#x27;t understand (which makes fixing it hard). I&#x27;ll get better with this with time, but associating lifetimes with object types is a bit confusing and hard to do if you want to do anything nontrivial. Again, I&#x27;m sure this is mostly because I&#x27;m a newbie, but it&#x27;s also reality.<p>- Verbosity. Rust is actually concise for the most part, but if you want to pass a &str to a function, but have a String, (which, FYI, is fairly common in my experience, as most string-related functions take a &str), you&#x27;ve got to either call as_str() (which is unstable) or dereference-reference (i.e. &*) the String. There are a few simple things that require you to be more verbose than some other languages do.<p>Overall I like Rust. I think it&#x27;s worth experimenting with, but I wouldn&#x27;t start a really serious project with it right now (because it&#x27;s so young and volatile). If someone wants to use it for a really serious project, I&#x27;d suggest checking out Rust in another year or two when it&#x27;s a little more mature.",1430575977

There&#x27;s no perfect language.<p>Almost simultaneously with C the Pascal language was introduced, completely safe and easier to learn. It enjoyed a period of popularity, and for a while it was widely taught in high schools and universities. Some big systems were built in Pascal, but every big Pascal app I&#x27;ve ever seen relied on external code in C (or assembly language) because Pascal is hobbled to enforce safety (see Brian Kernighan&#x27;s article &quot;Why Pascal Is Not My Favorite Programming Language, <a href=""http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html</a>). Some of Pascal&#x27;s faults were fixed in Modula and Oberon but those never got any traction.<p>To be absolutely safe the language is either crippled so it&#x27;s missing important features, or it requires a runtime to sandbox everything, check pointer references, do garbage collection, etc. And that slows things down.<p>I don&#x27;t see C going away any time soon in embedded software, which is where bugs and vulnerabilities can be most dangerous and where they are hardest to fix. It&#x27;s not much of a disaster for a video game to crash, but it can be very bad if piece of hospital hardware or a flight control system has a latent bug.<p>There are tools that can analyze C code both statically and dynamically -- the language is not just old, it&#x27;s mature.<p>I&#x27;m sure someone is already rewriting the Linux kernel and all of the Unix-y tools in Rust or Go or whatever. I won&#x27;t hold my breath.",1430575265

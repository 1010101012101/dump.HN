3411650,comment,3411028,3411540,0,0,andyking,,,"I think the days of generic local and national radio services, which play a mix of popular music carefully chosen to be as inoffensive as possible, and provide a diet of celeb gossip, political squabbles and local roadworks, are numbered. The era when half of, say, London listened to Capital Radio every day is long gone (and Capital itself now resembles an iPod on shuffle with the hits of Rihanna, Adele and Katy Perry all day and night with almost no speech). If being bland enough that no one switched me off was my business model, I'd be filling out my application for unemployment right now.<p>Where radio still has a significant role to play is in the discovery of new content, new information, things you might not already know you're interested in, and that might be so far outside your sphere of influence that the computer hasn't been able to guess you'd like them yet.<p>I work in the community radio sector these days; small, non-profit local stations staffed by volunteer presenters passionate about what they play. In my own opinion, all the algorithms in the world can't replace someone who knows their specific style of music and has the enthusiasm to present it to the world. This, I believe, still has a bright future.<p>I guess we're looking at two different approaches to the same problem of discovering new information and content. There are those who advocate an automated approach--you like X, lots of people who like X also like Y, try Y, here's an automated feed of Y--and there are those, like me, who prefer the more curated experience of broadcast radio, from a studio, with a presenter.<p>I don't sit still, sticking my head in the sand and pretending everything will be the same forever, with people gathering around the wireless to listen to the latest Bob's Country Music Hour on 1170AM. It's my job to reconcile this stuff, and make sure we move with the times, give people what they want, and leverage this new technology to benefit communities for years to come.",1325360887

3411635,comment,3410744,3411351,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> General purpose PC's will only disappear if the market for them disappears.<p>I think this is the key point.<p>In some sense, the market for them <i>has</i> been disappearing. The rise of web and mobile apps has shown beyond any doubt that a lot of traditional software is far too big and complicated for a typical home user's needs, and that Joe Public can in fact be quite happy sharing his life story on a cloud-hosted blog, keeping up with his friends via Twitter, playing simple puzzle games on Facebook, and watching streaming movies on his iPad. Notice that all of these are just variations on consumption/communication using on-line services. Heavyweight tools like e-mail and word processors just aren't necessary for what most people care about in their daily lives at home. In fact, I suspect that for the average home consumer, open access to data (both their own personal information and multimedia content they have paid for) and the whole walled garden debate are going to be far bigger issues than open access to general purpose hardware and software.<p>On the flip side, there will always be enthusiasts who do want more flexible hardware and software for their own enjoyment. All of those activities I mentioned above use software written by geeks, running on infrastructure built by geeks and funded in large part by businesses. And businesses themselves have widely diverse requirements and build many software tools both in-house and to sell to the public and/or other businesses. In short, the entire global IT economy is built around geeks and business, and geeks and businesses need general purpose computing. No amount of lobbying by special interest groups is going to beat the combined might of a global economy that now depends fundamentally on progress in IT for its recovery and future success. If a few sites on the scale of Google and Facebook do go dark for a day in protest against SOPA, I think a few politicians, a lot of Big Media executives, and the entire Web-surfing population of the world are going to learn that lesson very quickly.",1325360453

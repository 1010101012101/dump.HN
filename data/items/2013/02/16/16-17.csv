Go check it out.<p>The W3C spec does not put ""DRM in browsers.""  It allows browsers to use ""decryption modules"" that already exist elsewhere, like in the OS platform.  There are APIs to determine what sorts of ""decryption modules"" are available and to use them to decrypt media.<p>If we're going to transition to a plug-in free web then we need HTML5 video to support these extensions.  Sure, it'd be nice if the big media companies stopped insisting on using encryption to distribute their videos.  But that's not likely to happen anytime soon.  Premium video on the web requires either plug-ins or EME.  I think most of us would pick premium web video + EME, rather than premium web video + plug-ins, or (perish the thought) no premium video on the web at all.<p>BTW, open source browsers can easily implement this spec since it doesn't require the browser to implement a ""decryption module"" themselves.  Also, there is a mode called ""clear key"" that can be used if the underlying platform doesn't have any ""decryption module"" available.<p>Disclosure: I work at Netflix on streaming video in browsers.",1361033248

I think a system is ""better"" when it ensures that people can access entertainment regardless of their income, all things being equal.<p>Could we monetize entertainment without sacrificing such things?  Surely we can.  We can have serials, for example, such that the next installment will not be released to anyone until enough money is raised.  We can make movie theaters an experience worth paying for, rather than focusing on the movie itself.<p>This same sort of argument -- ""we have no alternatives!"" -- was made when automobiles rendered animal-based transportation obsolete.  Pedestrians might be struck by cars!  The speeds are too dangerous!  They are so much noisier than horses!  Yet in the end, the car was ""better"" than the horse, and now we face riots when gasoline becomes scarce.<p>I think the same is true of the Internet, when it comes to copyrights, photography, post offices, and so forth.  When I was a child, photography meant film, and you had to drop film off somewhere to have your pictures developed.  Then digital cameras came out, and for all the complaints about quality (remember when 1 megapixel was a big deal?), the film camera business fell apart.  It was not just that we had digital cameras, it was that digital photographs could be transmitted to anyone with an Internet connection at no real cost -- whether you sent one photo, or a hundred photos.<p>Is it clear that digital is ""better"" than film?  It all depends on your definition of ""better.""  Film has more pixels at lower cost.  Digital still won, and it wins even when the pictures are taken using cell phone cameras.  Digital present society with a new set of problems to deal with, like the ease with which pornography can be made (middle school girls can be tricked into taking pornographic photos of themselves and sending those photos to men on the Internet, etc.), but nobody claimed it was a panacea; it just solves the problems people actually care about better than its predecessors.<p>The same argument applies to entertainment.  People do not really care about quality; the continued popularity of camrips, and the continued popularity of low-end, unoriginal movie franchises should be proof enough.  People want entertainment quickly, they want no restrictions on when and where they can watch it, and they want to be able to go into work the day after a show aired and laugh about it with their coworkers.  My mother does not care about copyrights or DRM laws when she rips DVDs and copies the rip to her tablet -- she just wants her favorite shows on her most portable computer when Internet service is not available.<p>Copyright is obsolete because it encourages a system that makes all of the above expensive or difficult, and because there is another system that makes all of the above less expensive and less difficult.  Cars get people from point A to point B faster and with less expense than horses; nobody cared about the noise, pollution, or danger.  The same is true of copyrights:  nobody really worries about the risks copyright lobbyists whine about when they download a torrent, because copyrights <i>don't</i> deliver what people really want nearly as well as the Internet does.",1361032073

5231915,comment,5231394,5231632,4,0,Ologn,,,"When programmers discuss Python on the web, this comes up again and again.  I agree with you - it is a minus for me in terms of using Python.  There are ""solutions"", there are people who say you get used to it, there are people who say it does not matter, yet it comes up again and again.  I guess it does matter, to some of us at least.<p>I can open up a text editor and start writing C, or Java, or Perl, or PHP - all without that much thought on whitespace, indentation etc.  I can later run indent -kr, or perltidy, or astyle and so forth and make the code I banged out look nice and tidy.  Sometimes I feel like doing the nice indentation myself while coding, sometimes I do not and let the scripts do it.  With Python ""there is one way to do it"" and you have to think about indentation while coding.  It is annoying.  It is like Java and exceptions, forcing me to put try/catch loops everywhere and messing up my scope - even for a little prototype program which will be run once and will never need to catch an exception.  It is treating me like I am an idiot and forcing me to work in a regimented manner.<p>When I first learned Python, at one point I decided to put a do/while loop in my program.  I was not able to discover how this was done in documentation.  I go on IRC #python and am told Python has no do-while loops (which I later confirmed is true).  I was told, and I am assuming the source knows more than me, that this is due to the indentation system.  One screwy thing done as a result of another screwy thing.<p>There are a lot of nice things about Python.  The code is clean and understandable.  It sometimes allows you to do in 2-3 lines what might take 10 lines in another language.  And so on.  But some programmers feel certain aspects of it are drawbacks, and these things are not easily dismissable.  If they were, they would not be brought up again and again.",1361031767

There will be declines in manufacturing and agriculture, but only in the tens of thousands, because honestly, we've already gutted those industries. (Meanwhile, there will be proportionate gains in those industries in other cheap labor countries, indicating this isn't a tech thing.) If anything, post some magic moment where general purpose robotification (google ""PR2"") is super cheap, manufacturing will flood to... dunno... whatever country is best at keeping the lights on. Maybe Japan?

Most of my subs aren't called that way, so I do get argument checking, which has saved my butt many times, so I just make a habit of always using prototypes.

Consider your first question:<p>>Does having a mincome stop you from stressing over the guy across the street who has a bigger [house] and a better looking wife?<p>Well, no, however neither does almost anything else. It seems cultural, and is almost certainly psychological. The classic idiom, &quot;the grass is always greener on the other side&quot; illustrates this pretty well. Even with the wealth, whatever form it may take, to get the bigger house, the better looking wife, the whatever problems still arise. The neighbor with the smaller house, with more time for xyz, with a car they don&#x27;t need to fret over because it cost 1/50 as much as yours.<p>Those aren&#x27;t notions of freedom, their ideas of competition.

Maybe not every device creates more than it uses, but most do, enough to make up for the insufficient output of the others.<p>Similar to how individual houses are just starting to be solar energy producers, and put energy back into the grid as well as consume energy from it, these devices will both generate and consume electricity.<p>Obviously this won&#x27;t work well on smartphones, who spend the majority of their existence within a darkened cloth or leather pocket. But many other devices, which are designed to live in the light, will benefit. I wonder how long a solar-powered drone could fly, if it did not have to have a heavy battery on board.",1435096691

Chomsky&#x27;s many years as the dominant voice in the field were traumatic for linguistics. Once a decade or so he would promulgate The New Way of doing syntax, handed down from on high from this very influential man, which meant incredible disruption not only for syntacticians but also for those working in semantics and morphology/phonology.<p>Much of Chomsky&#x27;s influence came not from his intellect (though that was surely prodigious) but from his forceful personality. His will to publicly ridicule not only opposing ideas but opposing personalities was a big part of his rise and continuing dominance. Linguistics was a nasty place to work for a long time. (See &quot;The Linguistics Wars&quot;).<p>Now that he&#x27;s not actively working to maintain it, Chomsky&#x27;s academic reputation has suffered substantially and the field is largely trying to move on. Large-scale corpora and computational capabilities enable more empiricist rather than rationalist approaches to human language, which has made the argumentation less personal and more productive.<p>At least, that&#x27;s my take.",1435096666

Admittedly that trend is unlikely to have continued through the last recession, but it&#x27;s pretty hard evidence against the doom-mongers of the 1960s at least. And it&#x27;s remained resilient against a number of trends other than automation, not least a marked tendency to export jobs rather than unemployment to the developing world.<p>Manchester cotton might not have been welcomed by India&#x27;s textile manufacturers, but I&#x27;m baffled by the suggestion that the British decimated the Indian steel industry (I mean, quite apart from everything I&#x27;ve ever read on the subject suggesting Indian steel production vastly increased in the 19th century - railways being more steel-intensive than ceremonial sword production - an Indian family conglomerate now <i>owns</i> the British steel industry!)",1435096616

However, in September 1997, the Yorktown suffered a systems failure during maneuvers off the coast of Cape Charles, VA., apparently as a result of the failure to prevent a divide by zero in a Windows NT application. The zero seems to have been an erroneous data item that was manually entered. Atlantic Fleet officials said the ship was dead in the water for about 2 hours and 45 minutes. A previous loss of propulsion occurred on 2 May 1997, also due to software.

That plus any alcohol free aftershave leaves me with the best shave possible with low irritation (I have sensitive skin) and no blood loss. The shave lasts me about a day and a half before obvious stubble shows up. When I used a Mach III I had to shave every day.<p>That said, you don&#x27;t really need the adjust-ability to deal with beard thickness, you set the blade gap to match your skin, the angle you shave at, and your blade selection. The idea is more gap means the razor cuts deeper into the exposed hair, giving a closer longer lasting shave. If you get too greedy, you eventually cut your face. Sharper blades typically need less blade gap than less aggressive blades. Adjustable razors just make it easier to tune for the other two variables you can control (sadly it does nothing to make your skin more robust ;).<p>Having a single disassemble-able razor is what helps with beard thickness. The hair just washes away rather than getting stuck in between the blades. Cut beard hair is fairly sharp and irritates the skin as it passes over your face. It also bends the blades and changes the angle the blades travel at. That can also increase irritation.<p>For a large swath of the world that isn&#x27;t a big deal, but it makes it darn near impossible for me to get a good shave.<p>When I travel I use a non-adjustable 53 Gillette Super Speed[2] due to its light weight and size. It&#x27;s not nearly as nice as the Futur but responds well to the Astra blades for a shave that is as good as I would get with a Mach III but without the cleaning needs and less irritation.

My first reaction is that anyone who drops out due to a test has a high likelihood of dropping out because they can&#x27;t do the test, which would leave you with a low correlation test when compared with the survivors, but a very high anti correlation with the total population.<p>I read a blog post a couple years ago by a game programmer/designer who outsources a lot of work through places like odesk/elance. Basically his thing was to weed out the fakers, he&#x27;d offer anyone ~5hrs at their bidding rate to finish a predefined programming task expected to take ~5hrs. He says this will usually drop his pool to less than 10 out of the hundreds who may apply, and he can usually use at least one of the people who complete the task. It&#x27;s hard to say how many of these people go away because the task looks too big, and there&#x27;s risk of not getting paid, but it&#x27;s clearly a good filter for him.<p>As far as measuring this survivor bias, you might gain some insight by randomly altering the order of the testing. You could measure when people tended to drop off. You might even find that people all tend to drop off around the same amount of time, or maybe after some certain amount of effort. It might even be worth paying people to see if that would improve completion rates (while introducing it&#x27;s own biases).",1435096406

To apply these to a programmer, let us analyze.<p>I would say start with this question: What is the Goal of a programmer ? Is it to write great code OR is it to help a business succeed by creating things of value OR both OR something else ?<p>If the goal is to just write great code, then do they need to write great code along with others ? Or are they ok to write great code just by themselves ? If the answer is that they need to be able to write great code with others in collaboration, then you have your first point covered which is &quot;personality&quot; or I would say &quot;Attitude&quot;. If you cannot work well with others, you are bad programmer.<p>Now, if the goal is to create value and help a business succeed, then does it matter if the code you write is technically the greatest ? Perhaps not; other than the fact it personally is very fulfilling. Gotta love that feeling when that thing compiles!! But the real question to ask is: can I get the patch the system quickly if the code fails or the system crashes ? If yes, then you are a good programmer.<p>If the business team comes to you for advice on doing something technically that could help them increase revenue but may not be the best technical solution at this time, you are a good programmer if you can make that happen. You are a bad programmer if you tell them you don&#x27;t want to do it.<p>That takes to the other point about &quot;passion&quot;. I would say that Passion may be an overused word but it should be more about &quot;Do I like doing what I do even though I am not crazily obsessed with it&quot; ? If yes, then you are a good programmer. Why ? Because if you enjoy what you do, you will do it better (most likely)<p>The last point &quot;Tech Debt&quot;. It is again relative. Tech debt for what ? If my company is not making any money and I need to put food on the table, does tech debt matter ? Or does it matter that I need to get paying clients first and worry about the tech issues later. That is a good programmer who can manage this tech debt depending on the situation of the company. Oh but they don&#x27;t have any documentation in the code, I hate it.  Ok then fix it keeping the business goals in mind. If you have the time to do it and still create positive outcome for the business, then that is a good programmer.<p>Everyone else is a bad programmer.",1435096143

The actual getting-it-to-work part took about half an hour. However there was a requirement near the end that said the whole operation had to complete in less than X amount of time. The initial straightforward implementation I wrote took about 8-times longer to complete. Eventually, 3 hours later, after pulling out a lot of clever tricks I had come up with an implementation that met the performance requirements. The benefit of this type of approach is that it allows potential applicants of many levels to understand and tackle the problem while also allowing them to choose to bail out after that 30 minute mark if they can&#x27;t think of any way to improve performance.

9768008,comment,9766993,9766993,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Its a small firm and these are not uncommon issues.  The size of the firm means that likely the focus of the CEO is to bring in the next client, not worry about whether there is a development server setup properly.  A lot of the times, these are the exact reason he has hired someone that knows their job.  He isn&#x27;t going to want to know about all the little details, he just wants everything to work so he can sell.  And the feature he has you working on may be critical, as he sees it, to land a client or give existing clients something new.<p>My 2 cents.  Don&#x27;t judge everything just from 2 weeks.  All of your issues are valid, but give yourself a little time to acclimate to the team.  Gain their respect, gain the CEO&#x27;s respect by showing you can do the job and take care of details.  Take some of these issues you highlighted and fix them.  Add automated testing for your new feature, add documentation for it, setup a quick monitor to alert when the API goes down and learn the development setup so you can fix that process.  In fairness most of these issues show a lack of development leadership so be the leader.   Don&#x27;t try to convince the CEO why you need to do these things, just do them and the results will speak for themselves.  Do yourself a favor first, get the respect of the team by playing along and getting the feature done and do it with proper process and documentation.  That&#x27;ll go a long way.<p>In the end, you may hate it and need to leave, but give yourself a chance to see if it is systemic issues, or just a lack of development leadership.  I have seen many times when a small business CEO tries to control development because he doesn&#x27;t have anyone strong to do it. Usually this is because he doesn&#x27;t trust the results from the team totally because of things like an API going down and it takes a customer call to fix it.  Why else would he have hired an &quot;outsider&quot; to run the team?  He doesn&#x27;t know what he doesn&#x27;t know.  Show him through doing and see if it changes, if not, move on.",1435095511

The 2008 financial crisis is a solid proof.<p>But the thing is that if not this, then what ? Not everyone can buy a house with cash. Ok, so then don&#x27;t buy it unless you can pay all cash? Fine. Try renting an apartment without credit. Most of them will not talk to you. Now, What about employment with certain financially sensitive companies ? They check your credit..yes they do. It is a requirement to get an offer at those type of companies. Want to get car insurance ? They may check your credit history too. Of course you can choose not to drive a car. Did I forget to mention cell phone companies ? Yes, here in the US, most people get a post paid plan which involves checking credit. Could you use prepaid ? Sure you can but it is not very lucrative as you cannot get Iphones for $0.99 with prepaid plans.<p>So the point is that it is technically possible to not have any credit and get by specially if you have a lot of cash, but it is extremely difficult to get a lot of things done without credit in the US.",1435095261

I would create an MS-Access database at first to prototype the app, and then migrate it to MS-SQL Server later on when it went to production. I even made an ASP 3.0 based web app that could export the report to RTF, PDF, or TXT format for review on a mobile device.<p>That was 1997, and people who did the reports by hand ended up being fired. I felt sorry that I wrote a series of apps that cost people their jobs. My coworkers struggled with Crystal Reports because all they knew was Visual BASIC and Crystal Reports has a scripting language based on Ada. Something I learned in college as I attempted to learn as many programming languages as possible.<p>None of the apps I wrote used AI or were using robots, but they got the job done faster and more accurate than a human being would get them done. At most I called it business intelligence because I used accounting and statistics and other things a business would use to make decisions.<p>But I worked too hard and the stress was too much and developed a mental illness in 2001. Ended up on disability in 2003. Been in a hole and trying to get out of it so I can one day go back to work.<p>I&#x27;m in my 40s now, have a huge gap in my resume, and basically I am unemployable because I am old and mentally ill. Over the Opal CoC debate I got contacted by a woman who seems to be in the same area but she is a former sex slave that was trafficked at a young age and escaped and fought to clear her record so she could work and now she is in her 40s and learned how to program and freelances to earn money to keep a roof over her head. When managers and HR pull resumes, they throw away the ones with gaps in them, they want to hire people in their 20s, they don&#x27;t want a person with a mental illness or in her case was part of some past human trafficking in the sex slave market. There are some people who are unemployable until the IT market is reformed.<p>When most of the jobs are gone, I expect there to be some sort of social program like a basic income that is paid for by taxing the companies who use robots and AI and automation instead of people to do work.<p>There are a class of poor people who cannot afford a used PC and an Internet connection to learn how to program to be able to apply for the jobs. They cannot even afford good clothes for an interview.<p>I wanted to form my own company that helps out people who are unemployable and see what they can do. Provide on the job training and mentorship to get them up to date with modern technology and programming. I think there is a key need to provide jobs for people who normally wouldn&#x27;t get hired due to gaps in their resume, their age, a mental illness, exploited in human trafficking and overcame it, etc.",1435095129

The author is not disputing the point that there is a way to get in. The challenge is that at all points you have to completely rely on your employer to file and pay for all the visas and green cards. As anyone who has gone through the green card process can attest, it is a very complicated and lengthy process. It requires you to convince your company to spend 10s of thousands on dollars to file for your green card which doesn&#x27;t potentially benefit the company itself. It requires putting out ads on newspapers, interviewing some candidates and then explaining why they can&#x27;t be a fit. This is unlike some other countries (such as Australia or UK) where you can file your own immigration application if you check off certain things (such as level of education, no. of years employed etc.)<p>Also, the visa itself is not a guarantee considering it is a lottery.

While handling errors everywhere is a little painful to write, it enforces better practices by making you acknowledge that things could fail and ignore, handle, or pass the buck.<p>There are better ways of accomplishing the same thing though, one way is the Either monad in Haskell. Here&#x27;s an example I post sometimes comparing error handling in Go to Haskell&#x27;s either monad:<p><pre><code>    func failureExample()(*http.Response) {
        // 1st get, do nothing if success else print exception and exit
        response, err := http.Get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/status/200&quot;)

            fmt.Printf(&quot;%s&quot;, err)

        } else {
            defer response.Body.Close()
        }

        response2, err := http.Get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/status/200&quot;)

            fmt.Printf(&quot;%s&quot;, err)

        } else {
            defer response2.Body.Close()
        }
    
    
        // 3rd get, do nothing if success else print exception and exit
        response3, err := http.Get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/status/200&quot;)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Printf(&quot;%s&quot;, err)
            os.Exit(1)
        } else {
            defer response3.Body.Close()
        }
    
    
        // 4th get, return response if success else print exception and exit
        response4, err := http.Get(&quot;http://httpbin.org/status/404&quot;)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Printf(&quot;%s&quot;, err)

Read Veale&#x27;s The Creativity Myth. What you call &quot;creativity&quot; can be automated much like anything else. Emphasizing creativity would work for an extra couple of decades at most, so there&#x27;s no sense in building, say, brand new educational institutions around it. Check out the N.Y. Times article announcing the creation of the Camp Fire Girls (co-invented by Gulick, a co-inventor of basketball) - there was a panic then about automation and the problem was not solved, it has just been continually deferred as the pace of change increasingly wreaks havoc on our ability to prepare children for adulthood. When the buzzwords of today&#x27;s companies are &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;disruption&quot;, you may translate them to &quot;unpredictability&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot;, and &quot;social insecurity&quot;. No one even tries to design in order to righteously earn a place in a human being&#x27;s short life cycle - Silicon Valley designers often enough end up making dopamine squirters for poor toddlers on touch screens. The designers may heed warnings against giving their own children screens, ban TV&#x27;s in the home, and send the kids to an unplugged school, but fewer are able to escape the swathe of the indefatigueable machine, or have any coherent and ever-presebt religion or philosophy. Have we made some thing more clever than ourselves? Yes and no, but the no shrinks, not only as the machine gets stronger, but as it weakens us.
Some instead some could follow Kant&#x27;s idea of treating humans solely as ends, never as means, a sort of human-centered chauvinism or &quot;humanism&quot;. Or one can conclude that if machines lack human flaws, and out perform homo sapiens at their supposed virtues, they deserve the future. 
New genders, new sexualities, new body images, these might get some of the attention economy for a few, but they must be rewarded inequally is a mass of the bored; a creativity economy is the fame / long tail economy we already have. The production and assimilation of new distinctiveness will approach instantaneousness. And computers can be reformatted much more easily because they have no &quot;self&quot; to worry about or reinforce.

After an unsuccessful attempt at copywriting for a couple years, I managed to learn programming.

Admittedly we are a small startup and there are some optimizations still to be made on CPU (we&#x27;re working on being NUMA-aware, for example), but the CPU performance is not bad and still much higher for group by than you see in other databases.<p>You have to remember that we&#x27;re building a full database and visualization system and not just optimizing for a single benchmark.  In addition we&#x27;re trying to make the point that you can hit this 1-2TB/sec (depending on the query) on a single server with GPUs, which means assuming the compressed data fits in 192GB of GPU RAM you can get much higher performance that you would see out of a whole rack of beefy CPU servers, particularly when you take into account the network overhead that distributed databases suffer.  Furthermore, the bandwidth of Nvidia&#x27;s Pascal architecture (to be released next year) should have at least 2X the bandwidth by using High Bandwidth Memory and likely significantly higher memory sizes, so our speedups will only increase.",1435093627

I can imagine that the relative brightness of the surface of Ceres is very very low compared to what I&#x27;ve worked with, so keeping that in mind, any spot that spikes above some threshold is going to saturate your image.<p>My data set was in black and white and had an integer brightness range of 32767.<p>The raw data hovered between 20000 and 32767 (unitless intensity) because the instrument I worked on was old, and had suffered degradation, leaving a stronger &quot;dark current&quot; that needed to be removed.<p>General steps for processing involved:<p><pre><code>  1) subtracting noise from the raw data, which came via a number of different paths
  2) median filtering raw image frames into a single composite image, this may involve some masking
  3) removing large scale noise (in our case, stars, planets and the moon)
  4) adjusting the data range for presentation (this is only done for looking at the images, not for actual processing)

The last step is probably what&#x27;s causing this bright spot to seem so bright.

I built my own that integrates with the Linux native VxLAN implementation using netlink to program the forwarding table.<p>At the end of the day VxLAN isn&#x27;t a great replacement for MPLS but it&#x27;s a great encapsulation system for fully software defined datacenters that have already invested into a full control plane for all compute and networking (think Mesos, Kubernetes).<p>It&#x27;s also a good choice for smaller scale stuff because it scales down nicely.

I have had it since last November and still use it daily.  I love that they keep slowly adding functionality to expand its uses without overwhelming me.  After using it so much at home I often miss it at work.  I may have to get one for work at my next Prime renewal date.",1435093252

I&#x27;m not qualified to do that. But it&#x27;s my understanding that development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and much later industrialization, drove huge increases in human population.<p>In part, of course, that was driven by the abundance of food and so on. But there was also the need for workers. So as machines displace workers, one might expect human population to gradually decrease, perhaps back to neolithic levels.<p>The challenge, then, would be to have that occur as humanely as possible.",1435093238

Yet I thrive in stressful work situations, such as customer emergencies (system is down), critical bugs, etc and I resolve the issues quickly precisely because of the right amount of stress.<p>The best way I can describe the difference in stress is with an analogy. When I visited the Grand Canyon and hiked around the mountain, my body literally froze. I couldn&#x27;t move a muscle even though my mind <i>knew</i> I could do this and hike around. I knew it was irrational, but I was powerless. This is what interviewing feels like - a fear of heights. And with every rejection letter, the fear is reinforced.<p>Stress in the office is like playing competitive sports - it&#x27;s a challenge rather than percieved harm to oneself.",1435093225

Why?  Because there&#x27;s a social network put in place to support retirees... activity centers, social groups, travel clubs, etc.  And a social expectation that retirees will specifically be idle!<p>Similar support mechanisms do not exist for the unemployed today because the unemployed are viewed as failures.  Unemployment is not a valid life choice, and therefore society does nothing to support them.<p>This fundamentally comes down to the western idolization of work.  Address that and I believe you&#x27;ll address many of the psychological harms supposedly caused by a lack of employment.",1435093225

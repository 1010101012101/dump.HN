If the employee is good enough, he or she should be able to accomplish what they need to in a 40 hour week.  If it takes 1.5x as long then they aren&#x27;t cut out for it, or the employer is over working them.  Occasionally it&#x27;s OK to work more then 40 hours for milestones but every week is ridiculous.<p>One of the biggest reasons you don&#x27;t want this as an employer is the employee has no time to grow personally and pursue things on his own time.",1377539984

For example, during peak Japan/Korea hours you see lots of anime, food, cute pets, and jpop singers. When it&#x27;s America time, it&#x27;s largely food, porn, penis photos, fucked up images, and cute cats.<p>After watching this for well over a year, I&#x27;m seriously concerned about America. We are really a fucked up people.<p>For technical questions, I would advise people to seriously take a look at the code. There are a ton of optimizations in there. At a high level, an in-memory array of image objects prevents a massive memory leak I found in every tested browser last year in regards to garbage collecting image objects. Also, using in-memory canvas objects before drawing them to the display canvas gives a really nice performance boost.<p>I experimented with different display styles. A fixed random pattern provided the nicest display vs time on screen for images. Basically, the old image stays on screen as long as the stream is fast.<p>There are some UI features that need tweaking, so leave comments about good/bad stuff and I&#x27;ll take a look.<p>If you swipe up/down or hit the space bar it will pause the stream.",1377539440

The people who are pirating our game are also playing a surprising amount, with really great engagement - these are no casual pirates just downloading because they can. So this confirmed to us that our game design is solid, and that weve made a super fun game that people enjoy. To be honest, that is really great.

The only big complaint I have is that it&#x27;s somewhat hard to do loose coupling, i.e. for something somewhere to reference a type without either redeclaring the type (when that&#x27;s possible), or having a huge, centralized Types.hs that declares all the types that are used in different places (to avoid cyclic imports.) (Contrast with e.g. Go or ML where you have interfaces/modules without &#x27;implements&#x27;.)<p>This isn&#x27;t unique to Haskell by any means, but it&#x27;s the only real complaint I have about Haskell as a language for non-toy projects. The benefits definitely make it my go-to language. It&#x27;s hard to list them all, but by far the nicest feeling is the correctness: when your code compiles, 60% of the time your program works every time. (Not to imply that tests aren&#x27;t necessary--QuickCheck is great for that.) It&#x27;s an otherworldly feeling to write a program not in terms of what to do, but what kinds of filters you want to put on something, and have it just work (and either stay working, or break future compiles if something&#x27;s changed!) after compiling 10 lines of code, when you would have written at least 50-70 and had to debug it in almost any other language.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add another complaint: Haskell is like C++ in that it&#x27;s incredibly easy for a codebase to become completely unmanageable if your team doesn&#x27;t have a common style/discipline. Go is a nicer language for &quot;average&quot;/&quot;enterprise&quot; teamwork, I think, since it almost forces you to write programs in a way everyone will understand. If you&#x27;re in a team with good programmers that you trust not to abuse the language, this is a non-issue.<p>Edit: Okay, another one: If you change your Types.hs, the recompilation can take a long time in a large codebase, similar to C++.

Insel announced that that the D.S.M.s diagnostic categories lacked validity, that they were not based on any objective measures, and that, unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma or AIDS, which are grounded in biology, they were nothing more than constructs put together by committees of experts. Americas psychiatrist-in-chief seemed to be reiterating what many had been saying all along: <i>that psychiatry was a pseudoscience, unworthy of inclusion in the medical kingdom.</i>&quot;<p>In case you&#x27;re wondering how the current discussion conflates the DSM, a mere book, with psychiatry and psychology, large established fields, it&#x27;s because the DSM is to psychiatry and psychology what the Standard Model is to physics -- it represents a distillation of research efforts spanning decades. Therefore to reject the DSM is to reject psychiatry and psychology as serious science.<p>> ... your original claim is that this research posted here today is empty, navel-gazing non-science.<p>I suggest that you limit yourself to things I&#x27;ve actually said. But, without either producing a new, empirical, testable theory, or comparing the outcome to an existing theory, the article can only describe the sort of instantly forgettable observation that plagues modern psychological research.

There is an established standard for when a doctor can declare someone &#x27;legally dead&#x27; (absence of heartbeat and brainwaves).  We should use the inverse for a legal definition of life.

We are a web design company in the sunny state of Florida, so these are our rates based on 10 to 20 employees.<p>From my understanding the larger you are, the cheaper the rates.  Since the article /comments asked for typical rates, here is where we are at to compare.  Not sure how many employees 42floors.com has, but $2,500 per year would probably be around 5 to 10 employees if they were all male.<p>STD/LTD Group Policies - Our rates are typically $21 to $60 per male employee and $71 to $150 per female employee per month.  So it could add about $250 to $1,800 per employee depending on their salary and gender.<p>Maternity Leave - The good news is that this covers maternity leave of 3 months for our lady employees.  This is a nice benefit to offer. It also explains the higher rates based on gender.<p>Health Care Coverage - Most group health insurance policies are super high in monthly premiums ($200 to $600 per month for individuals and $1,000 to $1,500 for family coverage).  We cover this in full right now for individuals.  But it is a huge ongoing cost, especially as everyone gets older and starts families.  STD/LTD policies are very cheap by comparison (obviously geared towards a different life event).<p>Other options - It would probably be cheaper if you just bought long-term, if the concern is catastrophic coverage.

Yet they couldn&#x27;t find anything better for me than a cube where my kitty-/katy-corner neighbor spent a couple of hours a day on speakerphone, and the senior manager next to me spent a different hour of the afternoon chatting on the phone with his son -- a fabric wall is not effective when two people are sitting circa five feet apart.<p>I didn&#x27;t even care what they were doing -- or, in the case of the family chats, also <i>not</i> doing.  I just didn&#x27;t want to fight the noise for my concentration.<p>In another position, they finally agreed to move me to an office.  Which, despite better rooms being available (and turned down by my manager), they made a windowless box (fine -- well, ok, I can cope) located next to a conference room, with no sound insulation in between (not fine).<p>The irony in that was that about half of the team I was on at that point was located either at other offices or virtual.

If your argument is that no one can maintain any more than a 40 hour work week without burning out, I disagree.<p>So yes, even aware of burnout, I would still want to fill my company with people who want to work more than 40 hours a week.<p>This may be a twisted analogy, but I think of work in a way similar to how one properly cages a dog.  Some people make cages a place of punishment for their dog; break a rule, be disruptive, and you enter the cage, which is far away from all happiness or socialization.  It&#x27;s a place for bad dogs.  It makes the cage a hugely negative place for the dog, and causes all kinds of anxiety and trouble.<p>The solution?  Make the cage an everyday and normal part of the dog&#x27;s life.  Put the cage in the middle of a high-traffic area, leave the door open so the dog can go rest in the cage when it&#x27;s tired, make the cage a comfortable and happy place for the dog, and it becomes much easier to put the dog into the cage when the time calls for it (company, leaving the house, etc.).<p>Work should be thought of similarly.  It can be your 9-5 cage, or it can be a place you come and go, a place to willingly spend free time, a social experience where you interact with cool and interesting people who you&#x27;d hang out with even if you didn&#x27;t work with them.  In both cases, you have to be there 9-5, but in the latter case, you actually <i>want</i> to be there, and it&#x27;s not associated with huge Dilbertesque negatives.<p>So when someone talks about &quot;I want people who want to be there 24x7&quot;, they&#x27;re talking about having a cage that isn&#x27;t for bad dogs, but a part of their everyday doggy life.",1377538241

I find science to still be valid.<p>> If this were actually true, then libertarians couldn&#x27;t say anything useful about groups of people.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m here to argue the opposite :) Libertarian insight is more relevant because it&#x27;s deduced using principled  and empirically evident reasoning. This is like saying a microeconomics has nothing to contribute to macroeconomics, wherein reality macroeconomics is simply the resultant of microeconomic activity. Trying to understand economics from a strictly macro perspective leaves you with.. modern numerology.<p>> So what&#x27;s the incorrect statement here?<p>False dichotomy ;)<p>> I get that you&#x27;re proud of your philosophy, but why is it that every time someone represents it to me, they open gaping wide holes large enough to fly a planet through?<p>Many self-proclaimed libertarians don&#x27;t understand the logical conclusion of the philosophy and do a poor job of representing it. With people like Glenn Beck claiming to be libertarian, I can see where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>If I could try to convey the essence of what I, and many other self-proclaimed libertarians view the philosophy as -- it&#x27;s a framework for analyzing human action. Much like game theory, it doesn&#x27;t tell you what the game is or how to play. It&#x27;s simply saying, here&#x27;s a framework for analyzing human action, and here&#x27;s what the outcomes will be.",1377536616

What I do say is that observations can only be a preliminary to science. Science requires us to propose a theory about those observations, a theory that can be empirically tested and potentially falsified, a theory that can produce consensus between different workers in the field.<p>If we instead limit ourselves to observations and never try to craft a theory, we can accept any correlation as significant and call it science -- for example, I can shake a dried gourd over a cold sufferer and the cold will eventually go away. Have I cured the cold? Is that science?<p>Much of modern psychological research is on a par with shaking a dried gourd over a cold sufferer and calling the outcome significant. For example, recent meta-analyses show that talk therapies are indistinguishable from each other and from the placebo effect. Based on current studies, no one can say that talk therapy is an example of the placebo effect, only that it&#x27;s indistinguishable from it.<p>Here is the conclusion of a recent psychology scandal:<p><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-report-stapel-affair-points-bigger-problems-social-psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-repor...</a><p>Quote: &quot;In their exhaustive final report about the fraud affair that rocked social psychology last year, three investigative panels today collectively find fault with the field itself.

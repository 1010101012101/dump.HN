They replaced the motherboard, but then I sold it anyway a few months later.<p>Every other Mac I've ever had since then is still running. Another iBook, a MacBook, PowerMac G4, and the Mac Pro I'm typing on.<p>It's a little annoying, honestly. At least the PC hardware has the decency to die and get out of the way when I stop using it. :-)",1230569966

I've had the tingling, muscle knots and I've also had prostate pain and frequent urination.  I'm not sure if the prostate thing is related but my doctors have not found any other underlying cause.<p>I've recently found a couple of things that help:<p>1.  A book called ""Pain Free at Your PC"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pain-Free-at-Your-PC/dp/0553380524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pain-Free-at-Your-PC/dp/0553380524</a><p>It has special stretches, some yoga inspired, to counteract the problems developed from sitting for long-periods.<p>2.

Miley Cyrus isn't famous because she acted for Disney.  There are plenty of child actors who did the same and went nowhere.  Miley Cyrus is famous because she is the face of the Hannah Montana brand run by the Disney marketing machine.  A brand that has net Disney revenues in the tens of millions of dollars.",1230569735

413126,comment,412244,412877,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"That's overly simplistic. It overlooks two relevant facts.<p>1) I use your words to judge what you think, or how you might act. I can reasonably expect people who use certain words in grossly inappropriate circumstances (context <i>is</i> important) to be a threat to me or my aims.<p>2) For people with a living memory of oppression or injustice, words associated with those events are not simply neutral -- they're highly charged. It's not that the words ""nigger"" or ""faggot"" are somehow offensive in their glyphs. It's that there are people who are alive who have been humiliated or injured while having to listen to these words.<p>Now, none of this should be viewed as a defense of people who freak out at the slightest mention of an objectionable word, or people who want to ban any possibly offensive speech.<p>It's true that choosing not to be offended is easier to control than forcing everyone else not to offend you, but this ""they're just words"" argument is hollow.<p>Words are the result of <i>intentional</i> speech or writing <i>actions</i>. On hearing or reading words that we attribute to a conscious speaker or writer, we're naturally interested in their intentions, and possible future actions.",1230569566

413123,comment,412950,412950,0,0,brandonkm,,,"There isn't a magical threshold of hours one must reach to be a ""superstar"" or ""extremely good"". There also isn't much substance in the claim of people bailing even before 5,000 hours.  It seems like the crux of this argument is just throwing 'numbers' and 'hours' out there with disregard to other factors that come into play when someone makes a time commitment this large.  Things like efficiency, pre-disposition, and teaching others are all factors.<p>So, even if someone invests 3750 hours they can be just as good.  This all seems besides the point though, when you are investing thousands of hours into something your not keeping track of 'hours put in' or 'exactly how good you are', its a passion and you're just into it.  If success follows then great, if not then that wouldn't stop someone from continuing on.",1230569277

I mean, a pledge requires a person to put rational thought over emotion which is not something teenagers are known to be good at.<p>How many kids ""pledge"" not to try drugs?  Or ""pledge"" to always do their chores?  Or ""pledge"" to be home at a certain hour?  All these are examples of weaker temptations than sex and teenagers still break them.<p>That said, I'm weary of these results being this researcher clearly has an agenda (she's written about the topic several times now and keeps a related blog).  I've found statisticians who go into a survey wanting to draw a specific conclusion tend to draw that conclusion regardless of whether it's true or not.

413118,comment,412785,412871,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Dude, this is not a US thing. It is more an evolutionary thing. Men hunted, women raised the kids. If the man isn't hunting enough, the woman is going to find a better hunter. This is simply evolutionary anthropology. The pressure is on the male to ""hunt"", or to make money. This is not a good or a bad thing, it is just Darwinian reality. At the end of the day, I think there is really no such thing as ""romance"" or whatever, it is more just cooperation to help the genes survive, since we are after all gene carrying robots, nothing more or less, and I am serious, this is not sarcasm. We are here to serve the selfish gene. ""Love"" and ""to death do us part"" are quaint, deluded notions from the childhood of our race, much like the God delusion.",1230569065

After all, everybody knows magicians are entertainers. It's hard to be impressed when you can quickly deconstruct the process though.<p>I was quite impressed by the Tammet documentary, but your analysis is pretty stunning. I actually took everything from the original video at face value, perhaps because I <i>wanted</i> to be amazed by synesthesia.<p>I won't call it BS just yet -- there could be the possibility that the shape transformations he ""sees"" are the result of using algorithms in a subconscious manner, the clues of which only manifest themselves like play-doh imagery. It is rather suspicious that after the high-profile reports, there haven't been other publicized and scrutinized reports further documenting his abilities.<p>In any case, thanks for supplying a kick of realism back into the picture.",1230568955

Also, the act of giving triggers a response of obligation on the part of the recipient. His presence there is a big deal in enhancing that effect.<p>I also think there is something to be said for meeting the person that's going to be doing the work.

39500,comment,39398,39492,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You can't ""create"" good children.  They'll resent it when you care more about their life than they do.<p>I suspect people who work 60 hour workweeks have a tougher time <i>supporting</i> their children (emotionally, not financially), but stay-at-home parents also have trouble setting examples for their kids.  It's all a tradeoff.",1186286273

No matter how soulsucking it is, you know that if you wait a semester, you'll have vacation all to yourself.  And if you wait 4 years, you'll have a degree and can do whatever you want.<p>Cognitive dissonance is bearable for short periods.  It's excruciatingly mindwracking when it persists over an open-ended time period with no end in sight.  If you're a technical employee at most software firms, you <i>will</i> eventually find yourself in a situation where you have to obey a technical decision that you know is wrong.  Your options then are:<p>1. Don't, and get fired.<p>2. Convince yourself that the decision in question really <i>is</i> good.  This explains many Java programmers, actually.<p>3. Accept that the decision sucks, but that you often have to go along with sucky decisions for the sake of the team.  This is how good programmers un-learn independence.<p>Many people face this dilemma early on in their school career, probably back when the teacher first assigns busywork (which is now in what, 3rd grade?).  I'd estimate that 90-95% un-learn independence before graduating high school.  A few people make it through high school and college as rebels and underachievers - they never quite buy into ""This is pointless, but I have to do it anyway.""  Most will change their mind after getting a job - after all, most jobs really aren't <i>that</i> bad if you're not in a perpetual power struggle with your boss.  ",1186285809

This highlights one of the biggest areas of deficiency in Gmail.  Take the lack of calendar integration as one example.<p>",1186285527

But determination, like courage, is hard to predict. Some quiet people turn out to be very determined, and some people who talk big give up easily.",1186284971

39491,comment,39374,39444,0,0,pg,,,"School tends to make you tame too, but in different ways.  What you get in big companies that's missing in schools is politics.  You can generally do a class project on anything you want.  But to get something launched within a big company takes a superhuman effort.  After a while, hackers lose their desire to.",1186284664
39490,comment,39367,39367,0,0,portLAN,,,"""<i>Stay tuned</i> for a series on the strategies employed by the self-made to become billionaires.""<p>Apparently one way is to advertise something you can't actually deliver yet.  It worked for Microsoft, and apparently this blog is adopting the vaporware strategy as well.<p>It's also simultaneously an example of anything with ""smart"" in the name not living up to the claim, and anything with ""startup"" in the name not actually being helpful to start-ups.

39489,comment,39259,39259,0,0,g00dn3ss,,,"Hmm, let me think about the primary apps people around my office use when they want to get work done (instead of goofing off on the web).  Artists: Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.  Coders: Visual Studio, Eclipse, Emacs, etc.  Project Managers: MS Project, Requisite Pro, JIRA, etc.  Business/Marketing: Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.<p>Only one non-desktop app in the mix there - that being JIRA.  Looks like the death knell was a tad premature once again.

Edwards Deming's principles of statistical process and quality control imported from <i>America</i> in the 1950s as part of Japan's post-WWII reconstruction efforts in the manufacturing sector.<p>Its citation here is virtually tautological: the tool to improve productivity is Kaizen, which means improving continuously!  How stupendously helpful.<p><i>""Think, rethink and attempt Kaizen, with 100 per cent clarity and understanding;""</i><p>Apparently all you need to get to 100 percent clarity and understanding on a fuzzy concept is a bulleted list instructing you to do so.

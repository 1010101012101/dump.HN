193038,comment,192585,192860,0,0,Prrometheus,,,">Are they the only external people you need to be involved to make a deal like this happen?<p>Your banker should be the only third-party you need when searching for bidders. When bids start to come in, you will need lawyers, accountants, and etc., but your banker will help you find and manage these relationships.<p>Your job during a deal is to discuss and present the business. The banker does the rest.<p>However, if you have a small private business and you already have a bid that you like, the cost of engaging a banker is likely to outweigh any benefit that they can bring to a transaction.<p>>Do the costs change if the investment bank is involved in finding the deal?<p>Not in my experience. Their reward for finding a transaction for you is that they get paid. Keep in mind that your banker will always be biased in favor of making a deal happen. In my experience, we usually charged a small retainer fee to encourage the Company to do a deal as well.<p>>Are they useful at all in the negotiation or are they just paper pushers?<p>Your banker can act as a go-between, insulating you from negotiation. They will do research to try to establish what a ""fair"" price range would be, both for your benefit and for use in negotiation. They also are capable of bringing more bidders into the process, putting pressure on your most interested buyer.<p>Of course, they are far more business savvy than you are. This can work against you when they are negotiating the terms for their services. On the other hand, they usually get paid based on a percentage of the deal price, so they are incented to make it as high as possible.<p>>I had an investment banker contact me early in the year just to ""start a relationship in case I ever needed help with fundraising or M&A."" Is it worth meeting with these people?<p>Sure. Good bankers will try to get your business by giving you a lot of information about the market, and information never hurt.<p>If they know you, then they might mention your name when they are talking to firms looking to do an acquisition in your business sector.<p>Of course, if you're not established and you don't have a well-known name and these guys are approaching you, then they are probably not good bankers.",1211068620

193035,comment,188489,188489,0,0,LeWiemann,,,"Just a quick point of identity on which I believe you're absolutely wrong.  You wrote:<p>""Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group and want their kids to feel it too. This usually requires two different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes differentiate themselves by believing.""<p>I won't try to argue with you about religion, but it also denies the existence of ethnic identity.<p>Here's a counter-example: Black parents can tell their kids that they (the kids) are black, and that's not a lie (unless you deny the existence of ethnicity or ethnic identity), and there is no <i>need</i> to tell any further lies lies by which black people would ""differentiate themselves"" (even though such lies certainly exist).  Skin color and heritage are two very real things that are very relevant for many people.",1211068301

If you're the only one using the connection, then controls at the router or at Comcast's routers makes sense. Also mentioned on the other thread was Freedom ( <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/</a> ), a Mac-only application that disables access for a specific period of time or until you reboot. However, throttling sounded better to me, and other iptables modules (e.g. time and owner) can match packets for certain users and certain times of the day. I haven't thought it all out yet, I'm seeing what helps the most to improve my efficiency. (RescueTime, feel free to implement this feature :-)",1211067764

It is difficult to get Video to work because it costs $$$ to make it look good. This has nothing to do with getting a message across to an audience. It just sends the message - <i>""I have money and time to burn on hardware""</i>. Having said that If you have a reasonable audio setup ~ <a href=""http://podcastacademy.com/shows/detail1600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://podcastacademy.com/shows/detail1600/</a>  plus a good speaking voice, I'd recommend doing a podcast on topics that you personally have researched, discovered. I'd suggest converting only your best ideas into a podcast. It hits the middle ground between text and video.<p>I think the biggest hurdle for doing anything but a blog is the technical/experience hurdles. Not everyone has the voice and experience of a Doug Kaye. Not everyone has the technical chops of Justin.tv",1211067368

I've worked at various levels of programmerdom, and at least of the time the work was fairly mundane.

There's a point at which all of non-technical 'work-long-hours-to-produce-a-deliverable-under-deadline' work is done and then the effort switches over to making the occasional document/presentation revision and taking meetings, etc. This tends to happen way before the product is shipped. It's at that point that the techie catches the non-techie browsing boing boing or watching youtube videos and s/he starts to feel resentment.<p>That's when the stock split can sometimes start to seem inequitable in the eyes of the techie unless the split is heavily slanted in favor of the techie, simply because it's natural to think of 'value add' in terms of 'time invested' and not some other difficult-to-measure metric.<p>I know that doesn't answer your question, but no matter what you choose, it's a good idea for both people to discuss and understand the value of their contributions in terms other than the number of hours spent in front of the computer.",1211065222

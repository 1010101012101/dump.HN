And have there been any study pertaining to the accessibility of 0-indexed versus 1-indexed arrays to high-scool programmers which would warrant such an assertion?",1443380381

We have four times the reactors. And the share of energy we get from nuclear is eight times higher.<p>Your premise is completely off-base. If the US does nothing for 20 years, China might catch up to where we&#x27;re already at with nuclear. It&#x27;s questionable at this point whether China can afford to make those investments to even catch up, given their extreme debt condition, faltering economy, bleeding capital position, and the upkeep costs on the trillions of dollars worth of unnecessary construction they&#x27;ve done the last decade. Simultaneously they have 800+ million very poor to take care of in a rapidly aging society that is already overwhelmed with debt, but has practically no social safety net.<p>Where is the evidence that China has had a good outcome, compared to even mid-tier Western nations? They have upwards of 500 million &#x27;farmers&#x27; earning $1 to $3 per day, because China knows there is nothing else for them to do. Inflation adjusting those incomes, those half a billion people have seen zero economic progress in five decades - and that&#x27;s starting from practically the lowest base possible.<p>China hasn&#x27;t come even remotely close to challenging the notion that Western style governance produces <i>drastically</i> better outcomes for the people. It&#x27;s not a contest and there&#x27;s no great reason to think it&#x27;s going to be one.<p>The worst managed economies of Europe, have median incomes higher than the bottom billion plus Chinese possess.<p>China&#x27;s upward surge was caused by filling out the slack in their vast labor pool. When that surge ended with the great recession, China had nothing else to turn to, and started using extreme amounts of debt to try to keep the good times rolling. The Communist Party hasn&#x27;t accomplished anything meaningful, rather I&#x27;d argue quite the opposite: I think they&#x27;ve doomed China to decades of stagnation via debt, incompetence in leadership, and misallocated resources - the outcome to all command-heavy economies historically.<p>Realistically the US merely needs to grow at about ~2% to match China&#x27;s current rate of real economic growth (and that rate is clearly going to slow even more going forward). What advantage does China possess exactly? What is the evidence their leadership system has worked better than if they had had a Western style system?<p>Their easy growth is long over. Now they have to pay for all that debt, while placating the social unrest that comes from the lack of progress economically, and try to figure out what to do with their bottom 800 or 900 million people that are still considered among the poorest on earth.",1443380010

That also goes for English, and German research as well.<p>Both China and Russia began nuclear research programs against the interests of that western block, and because of that history, sharing was (and as I understand it from folks I&#x27;ve talked to about collaborating, still is) not freely, or as freely, shared.

Your logical answer is correct: 1/4 goes into 1/2 twice because there are two quarters in every half.

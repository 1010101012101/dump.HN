Using issue tracking like FogBugz or Github really helps you make sure you work on the important bits first to get a minimum viable product.<p>I try to think 'Lean Startup' on my projects. Only create the features you really need. Get the bare minimum thing working properly and get feedback/testing from someone who would actually use your product/service. Iterate.

I've been trying to improve the way I stay on task. Not just working on the project, but working on the most critical parts without getting distracted.

Key-based substitution ciphers, such as the Vigenre cipher[1], were already known in the 1500s. If two people each had a copy of this book, they could send a key to each other by referring to a sequence of characters such as ""the third row on page 25"". The messenger who carried this message wouldn't be able to reconstruct the key without a copy of the book. If you wanted to give the code to somebody else, you wouldn't have to send them the book: just tell them the ""seed"" words and the algorithm for generating the pages, which could be sent separately, for security.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher</a>",1364619396

It's something unique to that market, but when you try to speed up the dating process for straight people, it has always failed. Why? Because you're missing identity. Girls are still scared to meet strangers off the Internet when you speed the process up. And that's totally legit. I even worry about it sometimes, and I'm a guy. If you meet someone from OkCupid, and something happens, you have no way of knowing who is on the other end. You just don't know their true identity. So it's a huge risk.<p>To clarify, this is just me and another guy working on this. We don't get to spend 100% of our time writing code. We have to put a lot of thought into what to build first, before we build it. Social dating is more of a psychology game than anything. You can throw features at people, but unless they make the user comfortable and are highly engaging, it's all a waste of time. We're not trying to target straight people, we just haven't had the bandwidth to accomodate everyone else. We'll get there eventually though.",1364619378

5464429,comment,5460988,5461459,6,0,cyanoacry,,,"I've had to deal with one scenario where ZFS fsck would have been <i>very</i> useful, though it comes up rarely: corruption leading to valid checksums, but bad ZFS data.<p>In my case[1], our setup died due to some power problems, and somehow, NULL pointers got written to disk with valid checksums. Normally this wouldn't happen, but when it does, it's a PITA to debug because trying to traverse/read the disk gives a kernel fault, instead of a segfault as you might see in a user-level fsck program. This was a real pain, as we had encrypted disks, and every reboot meant going through the disk attach steps (enter password, etc etc), every time.<p>As a result, a userspace implementation of scrubbing would be useful since in this sort of rare instance, I'd be able to probe the fsck process with a good debugger and see why it's crashing. Since it's in userspace, the fsck program can also quit more sanely, with a full report on where it found the corruption. I was able to get my data back via some ad-hoc patches, but it was an... <i>interesting</i> experience having to debug in kernel vs in userspace.<p>zdb isn't a substitute for most of these things as the on-disk compression and RAIDZ sharding makes it difficult to actually see the raw data structures. Max Bruning wrote a post a while back with an on-disk data walkthrough[2], where he wrote some patches to fix this, but they haven't made their way upstream yet.

And we've seen people who are so engaged that they don't even finish college because the stuff they are working on takes over.<p>Between those two extremes are a whole bunch of people with questions, and I read the presentation as something Zach would have liked to have known when he was in that 'I'm in college but soon won't be, now what' phase. Clearly his advice isn't for everyone. I heard a talk at ""career expo"" from some guy in the enterprise consulting business and I immediately knew that ""enterprise consulting"" was not a career path I wanted to pursue.<p>Zach clearly works at a startup because it is <i>fun</i>. For him. For others it may not be. I personally like the shorter decision cycles that a smaller company offers, but see the appeal that a more established company can offer. Some of my best jobs have been where the company was small when I joined and then got big enough that I didn't have to worry about it going away without some notice.<p>Working 60, 70, 80 hrs a week on something you don't like is not fun. I would strongly recommend you not do it. Working 40 hrs a week at BigCo that you don't enjoy at least frees up 20, 30, or 40 hrs a week to work on stuff you do like.<p>It seemed like Zach was saying do startups because you enjoy doing them, not because you want to get rich. You can get plenty wealthy working at BigCorp and participating in the employee stock program and socking away your 15% into your 401k. The warning though is that if you're doing this to get rich, you might want to re-check that. There is a lot of luck with getting rich, there is a lot of fun by following your passions.<p>The last bit is the 'unsuccessful startup' thing. Since a lot of startups fail at one time or another, it helps to think about that ahead of time. Since startups you weren't even at fail all the time you should re-assure yourself that it isn't your fault. The only personal failure you can have with a startup is that you don't learn anything. If you're not learning <i>something</i> you are doing it wrong. Lots of ways things can go right, lots of ways they can go wrong, and sometimes both on the same day.<p>Think of your career as a 25 - 50 year journey and realize that you the prize is learning a lot. At some point you drop dead and just before that, its nice to be able to look back fondly of the previous years.",1364617808

I have a whole bunch of CDs gathering dust on my shelf, and none of them has any DRM or copy protection, so how come they are pirated?<p>Look, I used to run rave parties. We started with just a donation box, but eventually we switched to selling tickets because when we used the donation box <i>we always wound up losing money</i> on the costs of renting the soundsystem and the location. I hate to tell you this, but relying on the innate goodness of others - something that I naturally and greatly prefer to do - is a fast way to go broke.<p>Instead of going on and on about how awful DRM is - which I largely agree with but which frankly makes you sound a little unhinged - please show me some evidence that the honor system works on a larger scale. Because if I'm selling files for $5 with no copy protection and Joe Pirate is giving them away for $0 (but he doesn't want me to disrespect him by filing legal action against him or hurting his feeling by labeling him a pirate), tell me why people are going to give me $5 for the same thing that they could get for free?<p>'I hope people will do the right and give me the amount of money I ask for' is not a workable business plan.

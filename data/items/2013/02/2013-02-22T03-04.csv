    Essential complexity in the problem domain 
    is a conserved quantity.
</code></pre>
Either your system absorbs and obscures it; or you push it back on the user somehow. Even <i>within</i> a system you can push it around to different places, but it never goes away.<p>Consider: the problem domain for a blogging system is take stuff from an author and produce HTML for readers.<p>Movable Type used to ""build"" a whole site at a time. Wordpress does it per-view unless you use caching. Wordpress won <i>inter alia</i> because the cost of the complexity was pushed from the authors to the readers -- and it's authors who pick the blogging engine.<p>Static site generators are like Movable Type, in that they take the essential complexity that used to be on the readers and push it back to the author.<p>A more complex system would strike a balance by proactively generating new cached output based on POSTs, not GETs. That would push both halves of the essential complexity into the system itself, away from both authors and readers.<p>At all times, the sum of essential complexity has been conserved.",1361505549

The border control people in Australia denied him entry, and put him on the next plane back home.<p>When he told the border guy the full situation, the border guy said, ""Next time, just check NO.""<p>Then, this interesting quote:  ""You give us the papers we want.  We give you the papers you want.""<p>Meaning:  make the papers (visa forms) look the way we want them to look, and we'll give you the papers (tourist visa) you want.<p>I remember that rule of thumb when crossing borders, or filling out paperwork to open a new bank account in a foreign country.  Luckily, I've never had to lie, but it sure helps to make the forms look the way they want them to look, instead of treating them as an opportunity to express your individual quirks.",1361505429

But the flunky on the other side of the desk does it every day. And they think you are yet another stupid person who doesn't understand the simple procedure, and they have nothing but contempt for those who don't understand the procedure as deeply as they do (especially which parts of the paperwork are important, and which really are not.)<p>Nestled deep within this fucked up situation is an asymmetry of information that gives the flunky incredible power over someone who is, in almost every other context, perceived to be better than they are (especially in this case involving a young rich kid with an expensive toy). Most human beings, when confronted with such an imbalance of power, are not going to be able to resist abusing their power.<p>In practical terms, there are only two solutions to this problem that I know of. You can learn the procedure better than they do, and beat them on details. This can be effective, but it's boring and the payoff isn't very good. The other solution is to be really, really nice. To be incredibly accommodating. To engender a spirit of goodwill, joviality and kindness such that the flunky <i>wants to help you</i>. CHP officers call this the ""personality test"" - and they administer it every time you get pulled over, BTW.<p>It sucks. It's a form of psychic bribery. It's like they are saying, ""If you can at least pretend that I'm a good person, just doing my job, then you won't have to suffer. However, if you annoy me, disrespect me, I will make you suffer like you've never known.

There is nothing wrong with not knowing the GHz on your CPU.  It doesn't matter for many people, and that isn't an arrogant judgment (or at least I don't mean it to be).  I just think it's silly that we sometimes assume all people will evaluate technology the way we (tech people) do.

The answer really is, if you are running a ""web app"" with any kind of sensitive information, you need to have a security expert configure and administer your systems, or become one yourself, and you need to stay on top of every update.<p>Now, there are basic things you can do that will eliminate most of the casual script kiddie attackers.  Firewalls.  Defense in depth.  Keeping up with patches.  Google or any good book on computer security will provide this information.  But the sad truth is, if a smart, determined attacker has you in his sights, you will most likely lose.

It doesn't matter what it is, and it doesn't matter if it's any good or not, this is just a learning exercise.<p>Also, as controversial as this link was when it was posted a couple of days ago[1], I think you could do worse than reading through esr's ""How To Become A Hacker"" essay[2].<p>Our very own pg also has some excellent essays and articles[3] you might want to read.<p>If you're interested in getting involved in an open source project as part of your learning initiative, here's a shameless plug for what I'm working on:<p><a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick</a><p>If you're interested, clone either or both repos, and join the Google group[4] and I'll do my best to answer questions and help out.<p>All of that said, I believe that one of the defining characteristics of a good hacker is a high level of innate curiosity, a strong desire for self-motivation and self-learning, and a naturally high level of persistence and determination.

So, yeah, asking for advice and help here is a Good Thing, and looking for mentors is always a good idea.  But, in the end, don't rely on somebody else, just dig in and do it.

Ideally, in a file transfer scenario, the BDP and the socket's send buffer size should be equal. If your send buffer size is lower than the BDP, you cannot ever transfer at a greater throughput than buffer_size / link_latency, and thus you cannot ever attain maximum bandwidth. I can explain in more detail why that's true if you want, but otherwise here's this: <a href=""http://www.psc.edu/index.php/networking/641-tcp-tune"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psc.edu/index.php/networking/641-tcp-tune</a><p>Unfortunately for end systems with a high BDP between them, most of the time the maximum send buffer size for a socket is capped by the system to something much lower than the BDP. This is a result of the socket implementation of these systems, not an inherent limitation of TCP.<p>An accepted user-level solution to this issue is to use multiple sockets in parallel, but that has its own issues, such as breaking fairness and not working well with the stream model. I can explain this more if you want, too, just let me know.<p>As for zero-copy with sendfile, well, even when you do zero-copy, the above issues still apply, because the socket buffer is still used. Admittedly my research into zero-copy is very cursory, but from what I understand, even when you use sendfile, it still copies from files into the TCP send buffer, so zero-copy is actually less zero than it seems. It just doesn't require the whole user space read-buffer-write-buffer loop, which does yield a noticable performance increase, but that doesn't mean the buffer magically goes away and the BDP issue is solved.<p>What I was suggesting, by using an mmap'd file as the send buffer, would allow the TCP send buffer issue to be circumvented completely. In a user space protocol specialized for file transfers (not saying QUIC is, but I'm not talking about QUIC), you wouldn't need to use a send buffer, and the window size would become limited only by the BDP; the file contents are always available without needing to buffer them like the socket API does, and the network will never have to be idle just because the send buffer is capped at 10 MB or something.<p>You mentioned QUIC needing to do the whole userland dance to let the application parse packets and all, and that is a valid point, but, in the case of reading, it's entirely possible to only read in the header data you need from the datagram and let the kernel take care of as much of the actual copying as it can for the rest of the packet. In the case of writing, you can ""plug"" the socket, write headers in user space, then zero-copy the file segment for added performance.<p>Certainly there is a performance hit, since it's still going into user space, but there wouldn't be if this was all part of the kernel. Like I was saying, I'm not so much excited over the fact that this is user space or anything, but more so that it has the potential to exert pressure on the Linux community and such to make finally make some broad and well-needed changes to the network stack. Even if QUIC isn't being designed to address the issues I'm mentioning, maybe a user space-configurable socket library with the backing of Google will make experimentation with internals normally obscured by the socket API more accessible to people, and something good will come out of that eventually.<p>Anyway, all of these issues stem from the fact that BSD sockets are meant to be a general purpose communications protocol. However, some applications (such as file transfers) don't need all of the amenities general purpose sockets offer, such as separate kernel-allocated buffers so applications don't need to keep buffers after calling write(), etc.<p>There are other problems with TCP, such as slow start being, well, slow to converge on high-BDP networks, bad performance in the face of random packet loss (e.g., TCP over Wi-Fi), congestion control algorithms being too conservative (IMO, not everyone needs to agree on the same congestion control protocol for it to work well, it just needs to converge to network conditions faster, better differentiate types of loss, and yield to fairness more quickly), TCP features such as selective ACKs not being widely used, default TCP socket settings sucking and requiring a lot of tuning to get right, crap with NAT that can't be circumvented at the user level (UDP-based stream protocols can do rendezvous connections to get around NAT), and more. People write whole papers on all these things, though, and I don't want to make this even more of a wall of stupid text than it already is.<p>Okay, you can call me out for not having citations or backing up my claims again now. Problem is most of the public research exists as a shitty academic papers you wouldn't probably bother reading anyway, and most of the people actually studying this stuff in-depth and coming up with solutions are private researchers and engineers working for companies like Google.",1361503581

5262301,comment,5262120,5262120,11,0,drcode,,,"I think most people think the only reason bitcoins are useful is that they're not controlled by a government. However, I've recently started using bitcoins for some tiny transactions and found out something I didn't expect: They're EASY PEASY to use... much easier than papal, credit cards, or even cash!<p>For those of you who don't know. A bitcoin ""bank account"" can be conjured out of thin air using randomness and some crypto algorithms. It consists of only two numbers, a public ""bitcoin address"" and a ""private key"". (kinda like an RSA key pair).<p>The moment you've created these two numbers, you can say to someone ""hey, send your $$$ to my address"". Then, any time in the future you can withdraw money out of the account via your private key. This last step (withdrawing your money) is actually the ONLY step that requires any real effort at all (installing software on your PC, or trusting an online wallet site) and that's STILL super easy.<p>EDIT: I think I ended up sounding too much like a cheerleader in this post... I'm talking purely about easiness from a theoretical standpoint. In the real world, there are clearly still many obstacles making bitcoins a PITA to deal with.",1361502393

The bad reception of the 2012 Civic¹ was somewhat of a wakeup call for them, but they have been late to market with gasoline direct injection (GDI) motors, and there aren&#x27;t any American-spec diesels in development (the Pilot, Odyssey, and possible refresh of the Ridgeline could really use the torque).<p>Given the trend (a new chairman every 5-6 years), we should expect to see new leadership at Honda soon, and perhaps he will speed up product development, and return more of the decision making to the engineers.<p>Surprising rumors are that they have licensed the ZF 9-speed transmission, which will really help with the fuel economy.  And give the Pilot gearing that will help it off-road (the 9-speed often starts off in a higher gear, leaving 1st and/or 2nd for a simulated &quot;low range&quot;).  I was expecting them to go with one of the Aisin models, actually.<p>This is a big cultural change for Honda, as they have traditionally designed and built their own transmissions.  Given the stupendous cost of creating a new automatic transmission (well over a billion dollars), this will free up a lot of capital for them.<p>¹ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_(ninth_generation)#2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_(ninth_generation)#...</a>",1407725722

However, by waiting so long, and weighing other concerns more highly than justice at the proper time, the author has basically given up his chance to pursue justice.<p>Now, 15 years later, it is a very poor time to suddenly think about justice again.  Any pertinent evidence is lost.  Witnesses for and against the prosecution would be hazy, and most like lost altogether.<p>Physical evidence should have been gathered right at the time of the crime.  It is difficult work for the victim, but if we don&#x27;t demand that standard for evidence collection, it opens up the criminal system to terrible abuse.<p>Taking such open letters at face value, 15 years after the fact, also would create an atmosphere that is intolerable for a free society.  Accusations alone should not be enough to break a defendant.  Even serious accusations.  To treat this letter as anything other than fiction at this point would be bad on a systems level.

8161592,comment,8160338,8160338,1,0,cletus,,,"It&#x27;s interesting how the airline industry has evolved.<p>Years ago going from Australia to Europe typically meant going on the &quot;kangaroo route&quot; [1], typically via Singapore (the Qantas/BA/Singapore connection last year was replaced with a Qantas/Emirate/Dubai alliance). If you flew to continental Europe you often ended up flying to London and catching a local flight.<p>I visited the US in the 90s and ended up using US Air for a bunch of domestic flights. Primarily this was because at the time you could buy, as a foreigner, a number of flight coupons (that worked out to be about $50 each after 3 or so) that were redeemable for a single one-way flight (within a 3 month window).<p>US Air was (and is) pretty much the last holdout of the &quot;hub&quot; airline model in the US. I recall catching all those flights with layovers through Charlotte or Pittsburgh (or was it Philadelphia?).<p>The article is right that many passengers including myself prefer direct flights but there is some variability here. For example, I can fly NYC to SFO for as little as $260 coach return in non-peak periods. More typically it&#x27;s $500-600. I can fly &quot;First class&quot; (it&#x27;s not really that but it&#x27;s a bigger seat with more legroom at least) on AA for $1100 via ORD or DFW. That&#x27;s actually worth it at times. This compares favourably with the $4000+ AA charges for business on the new A321Ts.<p>Also, why do people prefer direct flights? It is at least in part due to the horrible experience and security theater that is modern air travel.<p>The A321T rollout is an example of what the article is talking about with reducing capacity too. Once complete, AA will end up with less transcon seat capacity.<p>But now there are not many places on the planet I can&#x27;t get to from a major airport that require more than one layover. Hell, I can get from NYC to Perth, Australia (almost the complete other side of the planet) with one stop in Dubai, Doha or Hong Kong, possibly Tokyo and/or Seoul too.<p>I remember the fanfare the A380 came with 7-10 years ago and the competition with Boeing with what I think was the 747-400X? It was a concept that Boeing lost out on and was scrapped. They dodged a bullet on that one.<p>These days it&#x27;s hard not to be on a Boeing 777-300ER (sometimes called 77W) for any serious long haul flights.<p>The article makes no mention of this but I MUCH prefer wide body planes (2 aisles not 1) as it gives you a chance of getting a center aisle seat where no one has to clamber over you to get to the bathroom. Ugh.<p>Anyway, this also evokes such boondoggles as the LA-SF &quot;high speed&quot; rail, which looks to be costing $30B, will take 15+ years to build, isn&#x27;t that fast and is designed to solve a problem that isn&#x27;t really a problem. The so-called problem is seat capacity between these two cities. It seems like the market is capable of solving this problem with bigger planes no one (currently) wants and prioritizing particular routes.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Route"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Route</a>",1407722844

To solve an equation for x is to construct a line segment of length x (i.e., a line segment of length x multiplied by the length of that &quot;unit&quot; segment). For example, one can solve the equation x^2 = 2 by constructing a unit square and then connecting the opposite corners. With a compass and straightedge, you can make two things: straight lines and circles, which are defined by linear and quadratic polynomials, respectively. Any constructible length will then be a solution to a bunch of equations made from various linear and quadratic polynomials. And these are the <i>only</i> lengths you can make. You can&#x27;t make a cubic polynomial by plugging linear and quadratic polynomials into each other (you can make it by multiplying polynomials, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re doing, here).<p>The reason &quot;trisecting the angle&quot; is impossible is because it involves solving a cubic polynomial. One can, however, solve polynomials whose degree is a power of two. The way to do this rigorously is with field extensions and Galois theory.",1407722677

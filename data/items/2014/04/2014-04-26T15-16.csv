Finding the &quot;spark of life&quot; would be amazing, but speculating about how it might have formed without actual evidence shows a lack of skepticism that runs counter to the whole ethos of science and ultimately undermines it. When the public sees scientists hoping and wishing that they can find the &quot;spark of life,&quot; and raising up hands of praise when some vague suggestion of how it might have happened is proffered, they&#x27;re bound to gain suspicions that this part of science, anyway, is nearer to a religion that a cold, surgical pursuit of verifiable truth.<p>If you don&#x27;t see the handwaving speculative wishfulness of the article, note this sentence: &quot;A related issue is that the reactions observed so far only go in one direction; from complex sugars to simpler molecules like pyruvate.&quot; Ah, so when you heat up sugars they decompose into simpler molecules? Amazing! Must have created life! God is dead; long live Nature! Praise be!",1398527959

Dowvnotes are there and an early blog post addresses that - <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-value-of-downvoting-or-how-hacker-news-gets-it-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-value-of-downvotin...</a><p>Note that down votes are a key part of what drives a number of automatic scripts that clean up things.<p>* People who waste too much of the communities time (asking poor questions that get closed and down voted ) get question banned - driven strongly impart by down votes.<p>* Closed questions that have a negative score and no answers with a positive score get deleted after a bit over a week.  (If people complain about how much crud there is, one should look at how much crud gets automatically deleted).<p>* A down voted question helps signal to people reading to not waste their time reading it because its not useful.  When you&#x27;ve got 8000 questions/day, someone saying &quot;don&#x27;t bother with this&quot; can save you a bit of time reading it.<p>For smaller communities where a person who wastes your time can get addressed through individual moderator attention.  Where there are 8k questions per day asked by a similar number of people, you can&#x27;t have every moderator address each poor question and time wasting troll.  It is for this that simple down votes can help drive the automated system when there is enough signal that the person <i>is</i> wasting everyone&#x27;s time without involving moderators.<p>Update:\nSo, because of how the system was designed, it isn&#x27;t something that one can easily go back to and change (and remove down votes).

The thing is, for lots of problems, Go is a better C than C. You can bolt on lots of safety features on top of C, and I think you could probably be very productive and safe in C <i>if you forgot a lot of the dangerous features</i> that C turns &quot;on by default&quot;.

7651745,comment,7650509,7650829,2,0,hierro,,,"We&#x27;re using an internally developed ORM in Go and it saves us a lot of time.<p>Pros:<p>- Less typing, which means less bugs.<p>- Type-checked queries, although this is technically not part of the ORM. We have a custom tool which statically examines the code creating ORM queries, checks the types of the output and lets you know of potential errors (e.g. the field you&#x27;re querying on does not exist anymore). Writing the same tool for SQL would be incredibly difficult.<p>- No need for long ugly SQL strings in code (well, except for the ORM implementation itself).<p>- Easier refactoring. If we make changes to a model, the ORM makes the schema modifications for us (with some limitations - e.g. if you rename a field you have to tell the ORM the old name, so it renames the field in the table instead of creating a new one). Coupled with type-checking this is god-send.<p>- Complete SQL database abstraction (database/sql does not provide that - placeholders, quotes, etc... vary by database driver).<p>- SQL / NoSQL / KV-store / whatever transparency. We have SQL drivers for sqlite, postgres and mysql, as well as drivers for mongodb, the GAE datastore and redis. Of course, some drivers have limitations, like the NoSQL ones can&#x27;t perform JOINs, but we still get incredible flexibility. We had one app running on GAE with a data model which was a good fit for the datastore. Some months later, a few requirements were added and moving to a relation database was the best solution. So we spun off a Google Cloud SQL instance, migrated the data and started using JOINs for the new features, while the previous code continued to work unchanged.<p>- App Engine / vanilla Go cross platform (well, you&#x27;d also need our full web framework for that, but the ORM is one of the key components). We have some applications running in GAE. If they ever get too costly to run on GAE we can just execute three of commands and deploy it to our own servers (and by &quot;three&quot; I mean the exact number: one command to move the ORM data from the datastore to the new database, another one to move the stored blobs from the GAE blobstore to S3/GCS/filesystem and another one to deploy the app to the new server).<p>Cons:<p>- Overhead. Negligible in most cases, but when it matters we can drop down to raw queries.<p>At the end of the day, I think using an ORM or raw database queries is just an engineering decision you have to make depending on your project constraints, not on the language you&#x27;re using.",1398527160

I&#x27;m unaware of any basic HTTP servers that use a persistent socket connection (which seems to be the sort of connection you&#x27;re describing, given the resource constraints you suggest) with clients in order to manage authentication.<p>Most often, the server just needs to set a flag associating an auth token with a given user (for whom it has a persistent representation, e.g. in a database.) Lookups against this token => user hash/map/table should be very cheap, especially if it&#x27;s kept in memory. Further, even for tens of thousands of concurrent users, that&#x27;s not a lot of memory overhead (1KB/authed user would be a generous upper bound, and that would still only be 10MB of RAM per 10k concurrent users.) Could be that HN is running on a 1990s-era desktop with 256MB of memory in someone&#x27;s office and that this is an actual resource constraint issue--but my hunch is that this problem lies on the software side, not the hardware/resource side.",1398524506

It&#x27;s quite possible to store the state necessary to allow 10000 simultaneous logins if you use cookies and a db to store your state, rather than relying on in-memory state and fragile continuation links like this (created a few minutes ago):<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=l5qgIWgvnRbHE7owLEaPMw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=l5qgIWgvnRbHE7owLEaPMw</a><p>or tying replies to stored state on the server which expires within minutes. Many large scale sites manage it, I suppose because they don&#x27;t store data like this in memory or urls. I&#x27;m not sure about this idea of storing state in urls, it often backfires, and urls should identify resources and actions, not store state.<p>There is no good reason the server cannot receive a POST request from an authenticated user against a node id, and perform the requested action (post my reply please), no matter how many intervening logins/actions it has handled.<p>Looking at the form in question (reply forms) reveals why it does break:<p><pre><code>    <input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;fnid&quot; value=&quot;UswPVmT3a8lZnqPBtcx359&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nThe server stores a continuation in the comment reply form, which (like the more link above) expires very quickly. The reason it expires is presumably because the server keeps a list of these fnids in memory, and as you say the list is finite, but it doesn&#x27;t have to do that. There are other ways to create a CSRF (if that&#x27;s what they use this for) which won&#x27;t expire so quickly, and this problem is not one which many sites experience.<p>It is annoying just how quickly reply links, more links etc expire on this site, and if the site used a different method to sign reply forms or construct other links they could get rid of this issue.

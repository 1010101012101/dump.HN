I&#x27;ve had experience with both.  I worked at a large insurance company / asset management company in Connecticut.  Initially, management was tight, so while we generally worked 9-5, those hours were fully utilized plus some.  Curiously, management was overseeing efforts, and not fully utilized, and most people in management had a side gig -- articles they were writing, speaking engagements, properties they were managing -- all during work hours.<p>Then HR changed the promotion policy.  You could only get promoted if you had 6 people under you.  My manager immediately hired three more people to &quot;stay&quot; a manager.  Then, he encouraged each of us to hire people under us, the wordload was mostly the same, we just created a lot more processes, controls, documentation, PMO, etc.  But not enough to consume all the time the now-gigantic team had.  While incredibly wasteful for the company and our owner (the US government) we had so much free time we were doing contract gigs during office hours.  Two guys had full-on startups in play.",1450252787

The 140 vs. 150 is a moot point: if you&#x27;re diabetic, you&#x27;re supposed to get your blood glucose fixed a lot lower than that.<p>Added: I read one of the studies, and it doesn&#x27;t really controvert your doctors quote. It gives fasting glucose target a lot lower than 140 or 150 (as it should be), and 2hr glucose a lot higher than 150.<p>In essence, I think you&#x27;re just interpreting these studies as you will without a proper medical training.

By being inherently single threaded, all blocking I/O must be done through callbacks. Result: you can&#x27;t block an OS level thread in javascript! So all libraries are inherently async (from the OS level).<p>This statement is patently false. I/O requests are fired off asynchronously in the main context but fetch data via background threads. In addition, in a multi-core/processor system you can use the &#x27;cluster&#x27; module to fire off multiple instances (ideally 1 per core) of the HTTPD.<p>As for libraries. Node doesn&#x27;t provide much in terms of &#x27;batteries included&#x27; but the NPM registry has eclipsed the library ecosystem of every other language. If anything, the issue is too much choice as there are usually 3-5 alternatives for everything you can imagine.<p>The minimalist nature of the Node core is a &#x27;double edge sword&#x27;. The downside is, it requires a lot more cognitive load and research to choose the libraries to use in a dev stack. The upside is, since most of the functionality is developed independent of Node the core devs can focus the entirety of their effort improving the platform/language/packaging. The effort of building all additional functionality is the responsibility of the community.<p>I have used Java some and C# a lot so I can understand why devs love the ecosystem and tooling. The tooling for JS is getting better over time but there&#x27;s something to be said for IDEs that come prepackaged with all the tools necesssary to be productive.<p>Personally, I shifted over time embracing the flexibility of dynamic languages and shifted to a mindset that favors composition over structure.",1450250801

2316656,comment,2315894,2315894,0,0,ajpatel,,,"I always find it difficult to grasp these economic concepts not having studied anything remotely as detailed in my college economics classes. But he's done an excellent job of explaining it in layman's terms. I found myself on an emotional roller coaster whilst reading this piece - at moments I was enraged, then again at moments felt like I could suggest something that would solve the issues, and then felt a little ""let's stick it to the man""-ish near the middle. Excellent writing...<p>Anyways, in terms of the questions my non-economically-inclined-self has to ask,<p>Who else knows about this? Are politicians aware? Is it something that's not being addressed because they are afraid of losing the support of their wealthy donors? Do the likes of Obama and McCain not address this and place blame elsewhere because it's too complicated to explain to the American public? Has anyone ever tried? I was born and raised here and have never been presented with anything nearly as lucid as this to understand this system over the past 26 years that I have been alive. To those of us who don't study economics outside of the 1-2 required classes as part of college studies, this type of explanation of Wall Street and the commodities market is never really given to us. We don't even cover investment options in school to be honest - most of us don't know what 401k's, IRA's, etc. are when we get out of college.<p>So back to the original question - who knows about this and what have they done to make the public aware?<p>Chris repeatedly mentions that commodities trading bets long and they mostly bet on the prices to go up. ""But in commodities, where almost all speculative money is betting long, betting on prices to go up, this is not a good thing—unless you’re one of the speculators.""<p>So my question is, would it balance itself out if we required the banks to allow their investors to bet on prices to go down as well as up?<p>Is this something the banks are abusing their power with - meaning now that they have the letters making them authorized as physical hedgers rather than merely speculators, are they abusing this power by not presenting their investors with the option to bet on prices going down?<p>Why can't we just revoke these letters given to the banks? What are the downsides? Basically, all these questions are simply my logical brain trying to figure out ""Ok, you presented the problem spectacularly well; now what's the solution?"" That seems to be my naturally-triggered response to reading your post. I hope he'll oblige with a follow-up or some other readers have answers to these questions.",1299930971

<a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/</a><p>This is a systemic problem. Any valid explanation of price increases in a commodity, e.g., oil (gas), has to explain why prices are rising almost across the board.<p>Global commodity price increases are being driven by two main factors. The first is rapidly rising standards of living in the developing world as many nations, especially China and East Asian countries, have freed up their markets. This has caused a dramatic rise in living standards and a huge decrease in the number of people living in poverty. These people are now buying the things that we in developed take for granted, and that is driving the prices of copper for cars and new homes, steel for buildings, oil for transport, corn for livestock feed, etc.<p>The other systemic factor is massive currency inflation in almost all OECD coountries. When inflation happens in more normal circumstances, an inflating country's money falls in price relative to those of other countries, and it's easy to see which countries are destroying their currency and which aren't. People sell the increasingly worthless currency and buy the strong ones. What we have today is almost all OECD countries inflating their currencies at once in a (failed) effort to boost their economies. This means that anyone who wants to protect their wealth needs to invest in something that will rise at least as fast as inflation. That means commodities.<p>BTW: If speculators can somehow control prices in a way largely independent of constraints, then why aren't they always doing it? It's not like human beings just started getting greedy last year.  And why have, for instance, prices of natural gas fallen thru the floor (hint: greatly increased supply due to drilling breakthroughs)? Where are the all-powerful speculators on that?",1299929785

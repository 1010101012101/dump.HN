This paragraph is very confused:<p><i>The Laffer Curve normally describes government revenues compared to marginal tax rates. It’s a curve because, given a sufficiently high tax rate, the incentive to work, report income, or live in a particular country declines. This leads to the argument that lower taxes are net beneficial: if we’re past the peak, they’ll raise government revenue, but even if we’re not, they can produce economic growth.</i><p>I think what he means to say is that the Laffer curve describes government revenue versus tax rate. That is, it is not that at a certain tax point the incentive to produce taxable revenue in that country decreases -- this happens at any increase in tax rate. Rather, the argument is that at a certain point the disincentive to create taxable income is high enough to meet the amount gathered in taxation. At any point beyond this point, the disincentive is actually higher than the tax rate, causing the government to acquire <i>less</i> revenue than it would at a lower tax rate (because the decrease in taxable income produced is higher than the revenue at the increased marginal tax rate). I think the author understood this (the rest of the argument seems cogent), but I just felt that paragraph was a little unclear.",1271617068

There are definitely some deeper issues, but it seems wrong to call out something as not being programmed by a ""programmer"" based on syntax. (Underscore (drawn as arrow) is shared by Squeak Smalltalk, at least.)<p>The second article probably would've done better to use\n  m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2)\nand\n  m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)\nas examples. Maybe matrices and arrays are implemented as contiguous ranges of memory underneath -- vectors -- but the language/standard library has plenty of functions dealing with them at a higher level, and you can live entirely within the abstraction if you like (although you may pay a price in speed, especially when constructing the initial structure). (""array"" does not take a ""by.row"" argument.)<p>I guess I agree with the overall sentiment, but I find most languages to be lousy for one reason or another.

In the later years, when the remaining principal is smaller, he pays less interest.  The buyer's total payment is the same amount over the term of the loan, but the portion allocated to principal vs interest varies linearly over time, til remaining principal == 0.<p>At any time, the buyer can pay off the note by delivering the currently-remaining principal to the lender.<p>The schedule you describe would effectively prevent anyone from ever moving before their mortgage was mostly-completely satisfied.  If you bought a $200K house and sold it a day later, you would have to send the bank a check for about $600K.  I'm pretty sure this never happens.<p>Furthermore, the lender is always making his margins (modulo interest rate variability, and ignoring loan quality), because any payments sent to the lender by the borrower will get re-loaned to someone else.  I guess you could write a contract so that the borrower would be penalized if he paid off early, but I'm not sure it wouldn't be usury.<p>Note that if you double a mortgage payment, you should be explicit that you want the excess applied to your remaining principal.  Otherwise, the bank can choose to apply it as ""the next payment"" and therefore split at your current ratio.  Regardless, you still have to pay next month's bill too.  :)",1271615276

1275217,comment,1274835,1274835,0,0,Tycho,,,"I've had a few interesting conversations with fellow IT students recently. One, a very multi-lingual individual, said he wasn't picking any programming modules because 'as soon as the dots and dashes start coming out, forget it, it all looks like Greek to me.' During a lecture on research a slide of statistical formulas came up, and it all looked like Greek to me. In fact, it <i>was</i> Greek (Greek alphabet). This got me thinking that maybe my aversion to maths is needless - if I can program, shouldn't I be able to learn new mathematic techniques too?<p>My next conversation was with someone who used to be a maths teacher, held a maths degree, yet seriously struggled with the programming coursework, even though she thought her maths would make it easy. I was surprised too. I suggested that maths only seems easy to her because of the extensive schooling one gets in arithmetic from an early age; she suggested it was because programming was 'a male way of thinking' (!).<p>What's the link between maths and programming as skills? I mean, is maths the 'source code of reality' - just like code with unhelpful variable names? Or is it really a different kettle of fish. I did well in maths at school... I just <i>hated</i> it. Trying to make sense of the mathematical notation in Wirth's 'Algorithms and Data Structures' reminds me why I hated it.",1271615212

1275192,comment,1275035,1275035,0,0,lotharbot,,,"tl;dw summary:<p>you know you're doing math wrong if students display (1) a lack of initiative, (2) lack of perspective, (3) lack of retention, (4) aversion to word problems, and (5) the few who understand the math just want to jump to a formula.<p>Math textbooks encourage teachers to teach math wrong.  The way they present problems is with a complex visual with mathematical structure already imposed, step-by-step handholding through the problem, and asking a question at the end (a question that can often be solved just by figuring out which number to plug into which part of the formula, without necessarily understanding why.)<p>Suggested method for teaching right: (1) use multimedia. (2) encourage student intuition.  Students will argue with each other about what they see and buy in to the problem.  (3) ask the shortest possible question.  Don't begin with a page full of numbers, measurements, and individual steps.  Let the detailed questions come out through discussion.  (4) Let the students build the problem.  Students will recognize the need for mathematical structure (labels, coordinates, measurements, etc.) as they decide what information they will need to answer the question.  They'll go through the steps on their own.  (5) Be less helpful.  The textbook helps in all the wrong ways, taking you away from your obligation for developing patient problem solving and mathematical reasoning.<p>Example: he completely rewrites a question from a math book about filling a water tank.  He produces a video of a water tank being filled from a garden hose, which takes excruciatingly long to complete.  Students get uncomfortable, complain about how long it's taking, and then put in their guesses as to how long it will take.  Then they decide what information they'd need to calculate the end result, ask for the measurements they think are important, do the calculations, and watch the rest of the video to see if their calculation was right and how close their initial guesses were.",1271614414

1275185,comment,1274911,1275117,0,0,raganwald,,,"> I am simplifying things a little<p>An important simplification you omitted: Microsoft used illegal monopolistic tactics to become ubiquitous. Do not skimp on the word ""illegal"" when thinking about this. We are not talking about one company being better managers than the other, we are talking about one company breaking laws that were designed to give the marketplace a say in the outcome.<p>Another thing was that Microsoft used many tactics for achieving ubiquity that may have been legal, may have been brilliant management moves, but the outcome did not reflect the marketplace choosing their products freely.<p>For example, they routinely imposed a clause in their contracts that hardware vendors had to license Windows for each CPU they shipped whether their customers wanted Windows or not. The net result was that any competitive OS would by necessity cost more than Windows because the customer had to pay for the competition and for Windows.<p>This created the illusion that Windows was more price competitive and that customers preferred the more affordable OS, when in reality customers had very little opportunity to make an informed choice based on true cost.<p>Apple made many choices that hurt them, but I really think we must be careful to make explanations as simple as possible---but no simpler.",1271614080

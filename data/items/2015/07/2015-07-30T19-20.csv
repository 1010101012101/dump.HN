It literally costs you money to even see an ad.<p>If it was 50 cents per MB, are you still going to enjoy that delightful little advertisement that just cost you 3 bucks to see? (obviously a hyperbolic price, but its the concept that matters here)<p>If you are 1MB away from your data limit and you go to some small website that loads 2MB worth of ads - are you going to be okay with paying an overage charge for viewing that advertisement?",1438286385

In the case of workers in the hotel industry, we have seen with good unions they can in fact earn a living wage and good benefits.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m wondering, where is the union going to get the money to pay a person that cleans a toilet $50,000/year+benefits?  Oh yeah, from the companies that hire them.  The most efficient way to pay someone is based on supply/demand/the free market.  Anything else is just a smokescreen for a broken system that will eventually collapse.<p>So the question is: is this really going to be good for small companies?  No.  It will make it that much more difficult to actually start and run a successful business.  The only ones that will be able to survive are large companies.  Sanders will then complain that we don&#x27;t have any competition left and try to bust monopolies..when these sorts of laws created the situation.<p>&quot;In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, the top one-tenth of 1 percent should not own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.&quot;<p>So instead of figuring out why the bottom 90% doesn&#x27;t have this much wealth, the answer is to just steal it at the butt of a gun from the wealthy?<p>The wealthy may own lots of the overall wealth, but we are also more prosperous than any other time in history.  The poor in the US aren&#x27;t as bad as the poor in almost any other country in the world.<p>The US is where anyone with money goes to start a company.  We have people literally sneaking over our borders and risking their lives to live in a country with more freedom than almost any other in the world.<p>It&#x27;s ironic because what Sanders is proposing will take away freedoms, create an environment where only big businesses and governments can thrive, and create less social mobility.",1438286348

This document laid out, in mathematical terms, the algorithms used for various signal processing functions in the system.  It was purely conceptual.<p>- The second was an Algorithm Implentation Document.  This document mapped the algorithms to specific parts of the hardware and software system, laying out the logical module structure and data flow.  It also specified how the algorithms would be realized in code, since parts of a particular algorithm might need to run in different parts of the system.  The AID was still primarily mathematical.<p>- The third was a series of software design documents.  These documents specified the details of module interfaces, code and file layouts, and specifics about what algorithms would be implemented in what functions.<p>- The fourth was the actual translation of the mathematical algorithms in the AID into actual C code.  Most of the engineering at this level dealt with function-level optimization and some platform-specific stuff.<p>Of those four levels, only the last is what I would consider &quot;coding&quot;.  It is also the least important.  Anyone who can really understand the first three levels and is willing to learn can handle the fourth.  As I mentioned previously, there will be differences in efficiency, but not in capability.  It would take willful ignorance for this not to be the case.  I think this is also what you are considering &quot;coding&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure; I also think you might be merging #3 and #4.<p>Now, most commercial projects do not run this way and, as far as I know, few have dedicated systems engineers to manage the system architecture and APIs.  Thus, the software engineers building the system generally perform the work in all four of these levels simultaneously as the system builds out.  Despite this, I still only consider the work that fits level 4 to be &quot;coding&quot;, and still consider it to be the least important.<p>What I look for when I interview are engineers who operate very well in levels 1 - 3.  If I find that, level 4 is pretty much a given absent the rare pathological case or someone with a very &quot;academic&quot; attitude.  The questions I personally ask deal with levels 2 and 3.  Those questions cover some of what might be considered coding, like API design and class layout.  I do not have candidates actually generate code, though.  Some of the other interviewers have candidates write small functions in pseudocode or explain existing, uncommented Java code, though.<p>I also need to note that we have a take-home test that candidates need to pass before they get an on-site.We have also recently added an open coding challenge which may eventually replace the take-home test.  This probably covers your requirement for candidates to code, even though it isn&#x27;t done in front of one of us.",1438285614

The leaked NSA slides from which that fact comes from also reveal that NSA captures and stores (for a long time) <i>all</i> encrypted traffic that they cannot decrypt.

[4]<p>2) Respected cypherpunks and cryptographers have periodically evaluated the project and declared it to be effective and high quality.<p>3) A weakening of Tor or the Tor Network reduces its value for intelligence gathering and covert law enforcement operations.<p>I welcome your questions and/or comments. :)<p>[0] That phrase links to <a href=""http://www.onion-router.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onion-router.net/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-March/019913.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-March/0...</a> (Notice that this is an official Tor Project mailing list archive, and that the message is still visible. :) ) Extended discussion is available here: <a href=""http://www.cryptome.org/0003/tor-spy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptome.org/0003/tor-spy.htm</a><p>[3] Other NSA slides reveal that the NSA <i>can&#x27;t</i> actually break Tor.

Science is about finding something new.<p>Why spin your wheels redoing someone else&#x27;s work, when you can push into new territory? Science is all about having a question, and then just &quot;learn by doing&quot; until you find an answer.<p>>Things I&#x27;m thinking of are<p>GWAS data is messy, and usually has already been picked clean by the time it has been published. They do get pretty sophisticated with the stats analysis though.<p>The Cannabis reference sequence is awful (I should know, I was the first person to make an assembly). Plants have really really complex genomes, and there isn&#x27;t the research interest to improve the references. This, combined with the fact there is almost zero available RNAseq data would make this project difficult. Yes, there is some RNAseq data, but to separate signal from noise you&#x27;d need several technical replicates, which we don&#x27;t have. As for phylogeny, the macro phylogeny is pretty well known from 16s sequence, and we don&#x27;t have enough individuals to tease out interesting population structure. Genome annotation, in the absence of molecular work, is always boring because it can only find what is already known from other organisms.<p>Most all of that experiment you linked was molecular work. They PCR&#x27;d up some genes and transformed them into yeast. They didn&#x27;t use stats to identify genes because the genes were already well known and sequenced. After that it was just a matter of putting the genes in front of a high output promoter and thats that. If you had RNAseq data for that experiment, which we don&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see the difference in regulation because the transgene isn&#x27;t part of the yeast reference genome. You could do a de novo transcriptome assembly, and then it would probably turn up, but it would be hidden among 5,000 other novel/incomplete transcripts. This is all beside the point, because, if you know the gene you transformed, then why do RNAseq at all? A Q-PCR would give you a more accurate result at 1/100th the cost.<p>Sorry to shoot down all your ideas, I think your initiative is great. There is A LOT of sequencing data out there, I am sure you can find a set with some fruit still on it.<p>Maybe start thinking about questions that are important to you, personally. What organisms are important to you? What resources are available on the Sequence Read Archive? What question has yet to be answered about the organism?<p>If you want someone to bounce ideas off of, I&#x27;m happy to help.",1438285460

Anyway, good point.<p>I was thinking you could maintain an array of flags to indicate whether you&#x27;ve compared a certain position before, and a count of all the compared positions so far.<p>Alright, here are my other ideas:<p>1) Properly chosen 8-character passwords are pretty strong, right?  So why not copy all of the 8-bit chars into a u64 and compare that directly?  You can treat longer passwords as a series of 8-char passwords.  Assumes a machine that won&#x27;t short circuit on u64_a == u64_b.  Less effective for 32-bit.  The compiler won&#x27;t undo this since it&#x27;s an optimization (1x aligned 64-bit compare is more efficient than 8x 8-bit compares, seven of which are unaligned).<p>2) Introduce a random delay after the byte-wise comparison is done that is up to 10x the length of the comparison.  The comparison variance gets lost in delay variance.  I know, a mitigation, but it&#x27;s effective.  Combine with random selection of characters for more effectiveness.<p>3) Use a perfect hash of the password.  You don&#x27;t need to compare keys after a perfect hash.<p>Thanks for humoring me.",1438284407

As the article says, history is painful to face, and students today are more unwilling to put up with pain and more likely to demand that they not be subjected to any pain.<p>Perhaps that just reflects what has been true of history, that it is often rewritten to convenience the ruling class and pacify the peasants.",1438283746

So you can write higher level plugin widgets with aQuery that use HTML with jQuery, or even other types of user interfaces like voice recognition/synthesis, video tracking, augmented reality, web services, etc!<p>For example, I want to click on a window and it will dynamically configure jQuery Pie Menus with the commands in the menu of a live Mac app. Or make a hypercard-like user interface builder that lets people drag buttons or commands out of Mac apps into their own stacks, and make special purpose simplified guis for controlling and integrating Mac apps.<p>[...]<p>aQuery could apply the DOM tree searching and traversal and data association stuff to the Accesibility Tree, which is similar in a lot of ways to a DOM tree, and describes all the widgets and user accessible affordances and commands in an app, as well as non-tree-like relationships between them (this label describes that widget, this tab represents that panel, this icon represents that view, this editor manipulates that object, etc).<p>[...]<p>aQuery should provide ways of registering patterns and calling handlers when user interface items that match them are created and destroyed. jQuery doesn&#x27;t directly provide a way to do that (handling page onload events and XHR request responses is usually sufficient), but of course there is a jQuery plug-in that does it: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/mutation-summary/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/mutation-summary/</a> .<p>So when some user interface objects you&#x27;re interested in controlling come into existence, you can wrap them with your own &quot;widget&quot; to glue them into whatever other user interface you want to provide. (pie menus, hyperlook, ar, speech recognition, etc).<p>[...]<p>I think aQuery should be independent of jQuery, but I like to use jQuery as a metaphor for how it works, even though that might suggest that it&#x27;s tied to jQuery, or even HTML, which it shouldn&#x27;t be.",1438283292

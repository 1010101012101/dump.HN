Search the internet and I think you'll find there are few, if any, competitors in this space.<p>I think your market is people looking for gag gifts, frat boys, gay men, and swinger types.<p>To create this business, you should develop a website and translate it to a few European languages (particularly German), keep it very small and focused on various types of sexy shower curtains, and you could market it a few ways.<p>Do like Playboy and the other skin mags and send freebies to frat houses. Attend a sex convention or two.

Looking at their github now, and hearing those recent numbers, it feels much worse.  That level of work is great, but for a company that does what Etsy does, much of it seems like overkill.  (Managing 1000 instances should be the same as managing 100, this is where automation kicks in.  Architecture enables that.)<p>Ultimately, that&#x27;s a tremendously large amount of engineers, to where I can&#x27;t really mentally assign what all but about 20 of them might do. Let&#x27;s be generous and say 30 - or even 40 :)  All of that eats into the bottom line (and also makes adding more staff harder, as your tech becomes more and more custom).<p>Really, at the basic level, it&#x27;s a CRUD-based storefront website.  Yes, it has scaling needs.  But it&#x27;s not really novel in that regard.<p>Yet, they&#x27;ve built more automation around their automation (lots of things in the Chef ecosystem) and probably made things a lot more custom.<p>I can understand some of this for say, multiplayer gaming or video streaming infrastructure maybe, but I would suspect Etsy could have been run a lot easier with less wheel reinvention.<p>Startups should really strive, IMHO, to write as little of software as possible, that&#x27;s outside of their line of business.  When wheels are square, build better wheels sure, but what I see from that number looks like MASSIVE levels of maintaince costs for being that custom.<p>So anyway, thanks for producing things that other people use and that are useful - YES - but from the startup accounting / efficiency perspective, I wouldn&#x27;t want to see my company run that way.",1430682998

One of the reasons I&#x27;m using Ruby is that it works well enough without having to tell types to the interpreter (which is already pretty strict about them because - example - it doesn&#x27;t automatically cast strings and numbers into each other like JS and Perl do).<p>However, in some very rare cases an object without method M gets passed as argument where an object with method M is expected and the code fails at runtime. It would be nice to catch this in advance, but if the price to pay is to start declaring types like I did in C and Java, no thanks. The problems I had because of dynamic typing have not been big enough to go through all that pain again (and code pollution.)<p>We&#x27;ll see what Matz ends up proposing to us, then we&#x27;ll discuss it.

JavaScript is no longer lacking in speed, and neither does Lua - and both are as dynamic as Python. Lua is much more impressive in this respect - LuaJIT&#x27;s speed, the work of one person, is comparable to the best JavaScript engines, works of multiple big multiperson teams.<p>The original Java was a little safer than Python, but definitely not on par with what you&#x27;d consider a modern staticly typed language. There were no generics, and everything was cast all around e.g. if you used a dict/map container. It was easy to have static typing locally, but not globally. The standard library at the time was really, really bad. I think I considered it acceptable only with Java 1.5.<p>A lot of modern Java is like it is <i>because</i> it was in widespread use, <i>and</i> it was so bad to begin with.

They are used regularly in Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle systems.<p>But, one has to be very careful to use them when warranted. The out-of-the-box tooling for debugging, maintaining, versioning, and testing code that lives in your database is not nearly as robust as what you have for most other development environments.<p>The key here is to use the tool when it is most useful.<p>SPROC&#x27;s are good when:<p>1. You need extreme data security and you are able to pass authentication tokens from application to database. You can apply authorization rules when you read/write the data, rather than transporting more than you need over the network. This eliminates a number of potential attack vectors. I have worked on HIPAA compliant systems for government agencies that held sensitive data that required all data access to be through stored procedures with proper access permissions, in addition to an authorization tier in the application logic. Very common use case.<p>2. You need to churn through a bunch of data and need very close data locality to pull that off and meet your performance requirements.<p>2a. Your database nodes are network IO bound and this is due to applications requesting more data than it needs, and that logic can be performed in the database.<p>3. You have a very strong DBA/Developer that can manage your data access layer that your application uses as well as code the database. This can abstract the &quot;how&quot; of data storage from the application developer, which can be very useful in a data-centric large application.<p>However, SPROCs are bad if:<p>1. You have to switch DB providers due to scalability, or cost issues, etc. The switching cost can be huge if there is a ton of logic buried in your database.<p>2. Your database nodes are CPU bound. In this case you&#x27;d want to do as little logic as possible in your DB. This is more rare nowadays, but used to happen.<p>3. SQL (or whatever-sproc-language) is not a core language you want your team to have to become experts in.<p>4. You don&#x27;t like adding more code.

I&#x27;ve considered this, and since Bay Area rent can pay off a really really really nice RV in ~5 years, it&#x27;s s viable option. The biggest hiccup is where to park it; national parks would be awesome, but they&#x27;re not free, Internet access is spotty, and it&#x27;d be a long commute every day. Even working remotely, month-to-month RV park communities can be over $500 a month, so that doesn&#x27;t quite feel like you&#x27;re beating the game of rent-seeking by property owners as much as I&#x27;d like.

9482651,comment,9481934,9482374,0,0,pron,,,"People often say &quot;managed runtime&quot; or &quot;VM&quot; but those things are not clearly defined. For example, if we look at Java and .NET, the two best known language VMs, they really provide few completely orthogonal features:<p>1. OS isolation -- the VM provides a platform-neutral API for OS services, and abstracts away details like clocks etc.<p>2. Intermediate language representation, a JIT (or several JITs, in the case of the JVM) and dynamic code loading/manipulation.<p>3. A GC (or several GCs, in the case of the JVM).<p>Each of these features is completely independent (in fact, some JVMs don&#x27;t even provide #2, opting for AOT compilation. Golang, OTOH, is not perceived to run in a &quot;VM&quot; -- simply because its &quot;managed runtime&quot; is statically compiled with the program, and no JIT is available -- yet it provides #1 and #3, just like some JVMs).<p>Now, as to <i>why</i> you&#x27;d want to provide each of those features -- well, there are different reasons. #1 is great for cross-platform portability. #3 is great for simplifying programming, esp. in multithreaded settings. #2, the JIT, is actually an optimization layer with some tradeoffs. A JIT can always produce machine code at least as efficient as the most sophisticated profile-guided optimizing compiler, and then some; to do that, it trades off warmup-time, and extra CPU cycles that can make a difference on energy-constrained platforms (although a JIT with caching might enjoy both worlds). In addition, a JIT is an absolute necessity when trying to achieve high-performance when running dynamically-typed languages. Another downside to JITs is that they&#x27;re very hard to write well (i.e. while they can surpass the code quality emitted by AOT compilers, it takes more effort to even match that quality).<p>So, in general, there is no such thing as a &quot;managed runtime&quot; -- just a collection of features, each with its own motivation. That name also has a connotation of overhead, which again, is completely false. A GC may add some overhead (RAM, latency) but may also reduce overhead (throughput, more scalable concurrency) -- depending on your application. A JIT may add overhead -- warmup time, extra cycles -- but may also reduce overhead (more efficient generated code).",1430681447

Given a set of vectors (in R^3), I am trying to find a way to generate a permutationally invariant representation of these vectors <i>that is also</i> rotationally invariant.  The rotational invariance is easily solved by constructing the Gram matrix of the set of vectors (each element M_ij in the matrix is the inner product between vector x_i and vector x_j).  Of course, the Gram matrix is overcomplete now (redundant), so I take the Cholesky decomposition to get a unique representation that has 3 less degrees of freedom (all the rotational degrees) than the original set.<p>For permutational invariance though, I&#x27;m having a heck of a time.  I&#x27;ve been extensively searching the academic literature on this topic, and maybe I&#x27;m just not using the right search terms, but I can&#x27;t find anything.  Recently I&#x27;ve been reading about symmetric groups and trying to figure out if there&#x27;s some kind of linear basis that I can construct its elements out of, but I&#x27;m not having much luck.  Anyone have any ideas?<p>If that problem is too hard, consider this simpler problem:  Given a metric between two sets of vectors (of the same order), I want to find the permutation of the second set that minimizes this metric.

9482609,comment,9480390,9481647,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;There&#x27;s plenty of lower grade sources available.&quot;<p>Energy intensity always goes up with lower grade sources.  Its not just raw &quot;jackhammer power&quot; or whatever the material is pumped or drilled out with, but all the related costs of transport and especially labor.  For example if you need to pay your employees enough to survive during an era of $400/barrel oil, then that resource may simply be un extractable.  Too many economic projections are based on absolutely everything staying the way it is other than... (insert commodity) increasing price to 5 times current price.  Well good luck not affecting everything else including especially process input materials.<p>That ties in with the level of socioeconomic stability a resource needs.  Perhaps that exotic shale refinery is theoretically economically exploitable at a mere $250/barrel oil, but there&#x27;s a slight problem in that the society/culture/economy needs to be stable enough to build it and it won&#x27;t be stable enough at $250, perhaps it needs to average well under $100/barrel to create the infrastructure and trained skilled workers required to build and operate the facility...  So if the price is low enough for society to be stable enough to build and operate the plant, it won&#x27;t work economically, and if the price is high enough to build and operate the plant financially, society and the greater economy will be in complete ruins so it can&#x27;t be built or operated.  In your example the only way to afford refining phosphate out of raw seawater or whatever would involve raising the price until everyone is dead of starvation, at which point there&#x27;s little purpose in a perfectly operating plant other than as some sort of interstellar robotic art exhibit, or more realistically its hard to build a plant when a famine inspired nuclear war is happening overhead at the same time and the place you needed to order drill bits from on the other side of the planet just got nuked.<p>This is aside from the aesthetic issues.  So if there were 95% unemployment, then we&#x27;d have enough starving workers to, I donno, create a &quot;chunnel&quot; all the way under/across the atlantic ocean or something.  With the obvious disadvantage that no matter how cool that mega project would be in theory all by itself, it requires 95% unemployement, of course, which isn&#x27;t all that appealing when considered in toto.  So the aesthetic issue is you might have to strip mine a national park or two when obtaining that low grade ore, perhaps.<p>(Edited to add: And this is what collapse actually looks like.

Even if you don&#x27;t think there are nefarious plotters sitting around scheming to rob old people&#x27;s savings by billing them for outrageous healthcare, in effect, <i>that is what Medicare is.</i>  It is a way to funnel money from everybody (or, everybody who is poor enough to make their money by earning wages under 100k) to people who bill for end of life and chronic care.  The role of the old and dying in this scheme is as concentrated conduits for the capital to flow to the billers.  (Billers, here, meaning providers but also the cut going to the payer/insurer/processing infrastructure as well as supplies, pharma, etc -- the medical/industrial complex if you will.)<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out something that is little-known by the typical early- or mid-career, technologically savvy and well-employed HN poster (including may I say myself, before some family experiences clued me in otherwise): in the case of Medicaid, at least, the state puts a property lien on all assets of the beneficiary and tries to claw back amounts paid after the beneficiary&#x27;s death.<p>In other words, there really is a department in the state government that is in charge of taking title to a dead old person&#x27;s house and car, and auctioning them off to repay amounts that the state had advanced to the medical-insurance complex on that person&#x27;s behalf.<p>So.  When I think of that, and when I think of those TV ads that promise they can sell scooters to sickly oldsters who can little afford them except for a Medicare subsidy ... it has more than a mere echo of resonance with grandparent.  In other words, much of the medical system sees &quot;dying old people&quot; as pretty instrumental for concentrating and slurping up cash, if not to say &quot;suck[ing] savings off&quot; of them.",1430680020

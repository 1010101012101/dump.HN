If a programmer starts with Rails, does that impact their ability to eventually go on to other things?",1355284788

I'd say I see as many S2/S3s around as iPhones (and probably more than iPhone amongst younger people).  They're everywhere.<p>That being said, there is an additional layer of difficulty when it comes to purchasing apps on Android that iPhone doesn't have - most people had an iPod and one point and have an iTunes store account set up already, possibly with some credit already on it (ITMS gift cards were popular presents for a while).  Play store requires you to enter your credit card on a new account, which I suspect is a significant barrier to app purchases for many people, out of caution or laziness.<p>Also, due to the more technical nature of the Android developer crowd, with the exception of games, there is almost always a free equivalent to paid apps which are as good or almost as good.",1355284622

The three credentials that authorize you to teach computer sciencey things don't test any CS at all:<p>- Supposedly, the business credential test has a question about flowcharts<p>- The industrial tech test asks about part of a computer<p>- The math test might have some set theory, but good luck trying to teach computer science with a math credential. The administration at your school would prefer you teach math as there's always a need for another math teacher.<p>CS is a delicate and fledgeling field in K-12 and right now it's a bleak road ahead. The small number of schools that have programming classes (let alone a CS track) is shrinking and the credential problem isn't helping.<p>One demonstration of the state of CS education is the college board's discontinuing of its Computer Science AB test in 2009 due to a mixture of lack of turnout and lack of qualified teachers to teach it. (Of the few CS educators out there, even a smaller subset could teach AB, most stuck to A).<p>With all of the opportunity generated by the industry pioneers here in CA, our CS education should be at the forefront nationally. We don't even have to embrace CS for its career potential. CS is a liberal art of the 21st century and I believe CS concepts would be worth it alone for its application and transfer to other subjects, especially math.",1355284206

Note that the subjects  were not rodents (we have cured rodent cancer a million times) and that at least some of the people have no detectable cancer anymore.

Any corporation which owns more than a couple websites collects bits of information about them from each site and then builds profiles of its users, often then selling the information.<p>Say you own a sports website, a fashion website, a political website, and a gaming website. The user only specifies a tiny bit of information on each website. Each bit is collected into a single user profile from which they can refer to do things like figure out what product advertisements to show them. They use the same techniques to identify users that don't have accounts, and still collect their viewing/interacting habits and add them to the profile.<p>Sometimes they'll send you an e-mail telling you to check out their gaming website if you're not signed up, because the comments you write in their other websites' forums have to do with gaming. Sometimes they just sell the information to a gaming company. In the case of Target, they might send your teenage daughter a list of baby products for the little one you didn't know she was expecting.<p>This is not some horrifying violation of privacy.

It is a much stronger theory than evolution<p>This isn't right at all. The idea that our behaviors are shaped in ways that increase our fitness follows <i>necessarily</i> from the theory of evolution. If we believe that behaviors are influenced at all by our genes, then behaviors that are detrimental get weeded out. What's left over was more fit for that environment. There is mountains of evidence that our behavior is affected by our genes.<p>That is not to say that all behaviors are optimal at all times. For one, our environment has changed monumentally in just the last few hundred years. Behaviors that were optimal back then may not be now. Also, there are multiple levels when considering optimal behavior. Behavior that is suboptimal for the individual can still be optimal for <i>the gene causing that behavior</i>. Homosexuality for example. It may be true that the homosexuality gene is optimally propagated when its in 10% of the population (look up evolutionary stable strategy).<p>I recently read about a study that claimed the male homosexuality gene when in a woman greatly increased her sexual attractiveness and sexual aggressiveness. When it's in a man it makes him homosexual. I'm sure its too early to take this as fact, but this scenario would lead to a non-zero optimal distribution of that gene in the population.",1355281502

Atomic also lets you design complex and unique animated transitions, not just the standard ones on mobile.<p>Atomic has some other special features too: like being able to style elements with raw CSS, visually rewind through your history and make branches/variations from any point, and team collaboration that lets multiple team members work on the same set of designs, even simultaneously.<p>So lots of reasons to give it a try I think. I hope you give it a go and please do let us know what you think.",1432699100

That is, one doesn&#x27;t have to go to that extreme to incur the downside of a &quot;non-YAGNI&quot; approach. It&#x27;s very easy to have contemplation of future features negatively impact a project.<p>><i>one reasonable guideline for modular design and separation of concerns is that each module should roughly correspond to a unit of change, in the sense that a change in requirements would ideally affect a single module without interfering elsewhere in the system</i><p>Wow. I think that&#x27;s exceedingly difficult to pull off and trying to design in such a way itself seems tremendously burdensome to the project out of the gate. It also seems that it would tightly couple the code with business requirements in such a way that change actually guarantees <i>maximum</i> impact to the code. Because, rules don&#x27;t change in a neat, stovepiped way. So, when they change, cross-cut, overlap, etc., then all of your modularization goes right out of the window.<p>So, interestingly, given that approach, it probably would make it more important to anticipate future changes, because your code will be less insulated from those changes!<p>><i>modelling bank accounts</i><p>Thanks for bringing this down from the abstract.<p>But, this is where generally good design can help. If you have your debit and credit functionality neatly encapsulated, plus a good overall model for chaining/demarcating transactions within your app, etc., then you don&#x27;t need to rip apart your entire model to support transfers.

When you are wrong it costs you. It costs you opportunity cost, cost of carry, cost of delay, cost of building, cost of repair.<p>With YAGNI, we build feature A then possibly feature B. Let assume that YAGNI and TDD offer no benefit, and the cost of doing A then B is twice the cost of doing A and B together, but sometimes we only do A, or we do A, and then later do B and in between A makes two months of revenue.<p>The question is, <i>on average</i>, that is to say, over a large number of features, which method costs less?<p>If you estimates and predictions are accurate, then clearly your solution is the lowest cost over the whole project.<p>If however, your estimates and predictions are poor then in fact you cause waste and increase costs. There is a point at which YAGNI offers the lower cost over the whole project.<p>It is my experience, and, it appears, that of Martin Fowler, that in fact we are <i>very</i> bad at making estimations, and <i>very</i> poor at predicting the future.<p>So this is obviously counter intuitive and not something you want to believe: on average, your &quot;best choice given the information available at the time&quot; will cost more money on average than just implementing feature A now and worrying about B later.<p>You have to do a risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis of your risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis. It turns out that your risk assessment is highly risky and your cost/benefit analysis is too costly for the supposed benefits. Its cheaper to YAGNI.",1432697884

In this case, having some depth in the slides might make a lot of sense, as would adding notes and links to information they will need or want.  For that scenario, some careful use of bold, color, size will provide talking points useful for interactive discussion.  No need to just read the slide.<p>(I hate it when people just read the slides)<p>Other times, it might make sense to have very brief bits of info.  Often sales presentations go this route, but technical ones can too.  People may take the presentation for reference later, but they came for the dialog and or what you are presenting more than they did attend to get all the info in text form.<p>IMHO, my experience so far has been to know your audience long before you build anything.

The logic was stateful (it had registers) and so it wasn&#x27;t something I could just run the ROM image through, so I ran the game with the encryption emulation running for each ROM fetch and built an unencrypted ROM image for the game while playing. After that I just released the unencrypted ROM image, but the decryption stuff was still sitting around in the MAME source last time I checked.<p>I think I may have done the actual game emulation stuff for Jr. Pac, too—it was basically the same as Pac-Mac/Ms. Pac-Man with the addition of scrolling hardware and a bit that controlled whether the sprites showed up on top of or underneath the character/text graphics. That bit is so that during the cutscenes the sprites could be on one side of a fence or the other, or go inside a house. It&#x27;s a single bit for <i>all</i> the sprites though, so if you pay attention to the cut scenes, when a character sprite goes behind something, all the other character sprites are away from the text graphics so that they don&#x27;t go behind things as well.",1432696340

Not new housing construction, borrowing money so people can spend more on housing. Which therefore bids up the cost of housing for anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet or never will save enough for a down payment. On top of that, it&#x27;s structured so that people in higher tax brackets or who own more expensive property get more subsidy.<p>Since you now can&#x27;t afford housing, the government will provide subsidized housing projects with no hot water but plenty of drug dealers.<p>You might want out of these conditions and start working a second job in order to save up a down payment for your own property. But the added income from your second job disqualifies you from the government subsidies, so running twice as fast only keeps you in the same place.<p>At some point a working class person starts to wonder if they wouldn&#x27;t be better off if the government would stop &quot;helping&quot; them so much.",1432695605

This tells me that C&#x27;s native integer type is ptrdiff_t, not size_t.  (And I agree this is crazy: unsigned modular arithmetic would be fine, but they chose a signed result for pointer subtraction).<p>Why care about this? You should try to get a clean compile with -Wconversion, but also you should avoid adding casts all over the place (they hide potential problems).  It&#x27;s cleaner to wrap all instances of size_t with ptrdiff_t- you can even check for signed overflow in these cases if you are worried about it.<p>There is another reason: loop index code written to work properly for unsigned will work for signed, but the reverse is not true.  This means you have to think about every loop if you intend to do some kind of global conversion to unsigned.",1438491430

There are several types of pilots license but they all fall into the category of commercial or private. Private pilots can bring passengers in their planes much like private drivers can bring people in their cars. BUT private pilots cannot explicitly sell their service. Passengers on a private plane cannot be the sole reason a flight is happening in the first place. If you are a pilot and you break this law, you risk loosing your license (and it is a much higher investment of time and money than a driver license).<p>For a while there were legally grey areas involving &quot;fly share&quot; websites. A recent-ish FAA ruling determined that this is not legally grey, it is not allowed. Period. Dot. Until that issue is resolved, Air-Uber is a head-in-the-clouds dream.<p>IMO the FAA is right to enforce a certain level of safety and competence in the skies. Most pilots agree with them. This is not like taxi medallions. The regulatory body actually does something useful rather than just protecting rent seekers. At the same time, I think there is a demand for fly-sharing. Perhaps the FAA could create a license in-between commercial and private that allows you to shuttle up to 4 people in a Cessna or similar aircraft.",1438490798

The amount of dev work on the unix side to do a mainframe RPC or to do it from scratch was comparable. From most perspectives, the unix re-implementation was a pure win. It sounds like a clear-cut decision, but the MF people argued fiercely against it -- to the best of my understanding, because they were constantly losing turf and relevance.

9989770,comment,9987679,9987679,0,0,stevewepay,,,"USENET has always been used for porn and piracy, since at least the early 90s.  Of course, most of the great newsgroups were discussions-based, but probably most of the bandwidth was porn and piracy.<p>When I was in college, I remember someone on my floor had written a program in Pascal that automatically downloaded porn off USENET.  He would leave his computer running all the time, connected to the college&#x27;s internet connection via modem, and we would occasionally see a flash of a porn pic on his screen and ask &quot;What was that?&quot;.  This was before the days of integrated TCP/IP stacks in the OS, so if I remember correctly he had to dial in via modem and then use something called Slurp or something like that, I can&#x27;t remember exactly now.<p>This continued all through the 90s.  A bunch of my friends had Airnews accounts and downloaded mp3s and porn 24x7, during what we called the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of piracy, when Napster was starting up in 97 up until the early 2000s, when the bust hit.<p>At some point, the medium for discussions moved off of USENET and went to more user friendly places like email mailing lists, google groups, yahoo groups, reddit, etc.  This left only piracy and porn on USENET, and I&#x27;m actually surprised that some ISPs still support USENET at this point.",1438490449

Ex.1 - Offer people who purchased plane tickets but needed to cancel (and were not allowed to because of no-refund policy) a service to sell to others at the (presumably low b/c it was purchased early) price they bought it.<p>&quot;How will your company make money?&quot;

It was a Kodansha imprint, for English learners I think. Anyway, I&#x27;d already read a number of Murakami books by that time (<i>Wild Sheep Chase</i>, <i>Dance, Dance, Dance</i> and <i>Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i>), and enjoyed them so I snapped it up. It was an ok read but far from his best (which for me, still remains <i>Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i>).<p>Later, I researched that Kodansha edition on the net and realised that it had never really been made available in English speaking countries and was fairly rare. So I put it up for sale on eBay, probably in 2000 or 2001. Thought it might attract a bit of interest but was pleasantly surprised when it attracted <i>a lot</i> of interest and eventually sold for something like $300. Can&#x27;t remember the exact final bid but it was around that. Was happy to sell it for that and still happy now. I doubt it&#x27;s appreciated in value since then but I could be wrong.<p>Anyway, it appears from this article that <i>Pinball, 1973</i> and <i>Hear the wind sing</i> are now finally being published in a generally distributed edition. I&#x27;m a little bit surprised because it was my understanding that Murakami thought they were early, weaker works and wasn&#x27;t particularly keen for them to get new attention.",1438488962

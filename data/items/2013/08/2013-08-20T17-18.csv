6245383,comment,6243627,6243627,5,0,cmollis,,,"My interview at Google was a disaster.  I passed the phone screens (easy), and then they flew me out to Mountain View.  Now, the job was actually programming python for YouTube..  which I could have done in my sleep.  I&#x27;ve done similar things for years, for many other companies (even some in the Valley, even though I live on the East Coast).  So whatever, I thought it was going ok, and then they asked me a bunch of puzzle questions (which I sucked at.. at least I&#x27;m pretty sure I did).  (You know, the typical mindless puzzle questions that are completely unrelated to anything remotely resembling the work you you&#x27;d be doing).  I&#x27;m sure it sounds like I&#x27;m bitter (I&#x27;m not), and I&#x27;m sure there are many smarter than I am that do well at those things.  But I couldn&#x27;t help thinking that they should&#x27;ve asked me something related to what I&#x27;d be doing, or what I&#x27;d done.<p>I didn&#x27;t get the job, but now Google keeps calling me for interviews.

6245326,comment,6244444,6244444,1,0,aufreak3,,,"Extract from the abstract - &quot;People consistently report that sound is the most important source of information in evaluating performance in music. However, the findings demonstrate that people actually depend primarily on visual information when making judgments about music performance.&quot;<p>Not too surprising a result. It would&#x27;ve been interesting to propose a model of cognition that might account for this effect. The &quot;embodied music cognition&quot; school might, for example, propose something like this -- &quot;the brain needs to process the inputs and reconstruct the body movements required to produce the sound so that the music can be experienced in the listener&#x27;s body. This is less work when given the visual signal alone than when given the audio signal alone.&quot;<p>Also, I was curious about what instruments or vocal music the competitions were about, but the paper doesn&#x27;t talk about that (in my quick scan through). I venture a prediction that for vocal music, the audio alone is likely to be a better predictor than the visual alone, but for piano and violin the visual may show this effect.<p>Another point that struck me was that the experiments featured the performances of only the top-three finalists in competitions. These are already performers who the judges in those competitions selected as good, suggesting that perhaps these performers are not very distinguishable by their sound alone anyway.

6245323,comment,6240474,6241950,3,0,adamtj,,,"The viral nature of twisted is not limited to twisted and shows up in lots of places.  It&#x27;s actually a consequence of the problem that &quot;concurrency is Hard&quot;.<p>There is a tradeoff to be made between pre-emptive and cooperative multitasking.  Every platform must choose one or the other or a mix of both, and then deal with the consequences.  Threads, of course, have a well-known class of very dangerous bugs that make using them difficult.  Processes make pre-emptive multitasking much safer by erecting certain barriers, but at the cost of being much more tedious.<p>These days, callbacks, events and other forms of cooperative multitasking are the new shiny.  They avoid the big problems of threads and multiple processes, but have some problems of their own.  First and simplest is that you can only use one CPU per process without mixing in threads or multiple processes.  Second, if something doesn&#x27;t cooperate, it blocks everything else.  You have to be very careful about when and where you yield the CPU.  Because of that, everything must be event-driven or use callbacks, or you risk trashing your throughput and/or latency.<p>Threads have a similar problem: if you use them, you&#x27;re stuck using thread-safe libraries.  It&#x27;s not as bad as the cooperative case though.  The thread-safety of a library can be independant of the code that uses it.  In the cooperative case, you don&#x27;t have that independence.  You&#x27;re not just stuck with cooperative-safe libraries.  You are restricted to events or callbacks that are compatible with the cooperative framework used in your application.  If your application uses events, then the library must use events instead of callbacks, and it must use the same types of events to plug into your event loop.  If not, then you need a compatibility layer.  Some cooperative languages reduce the problem by mandating how events and/or callbacks work for all libraries.  Python doesn&#x27;t have that, which where the viral nature of twisted comes from.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re talking about twisted-compatible libraries and not just python libraries, and why this a non-issue with node.js database libraries.<p>edit: wording",1377020930

But I think the reasons are:<p>Marketers know a lot about G+ and like to use it.<p>If your content is submitted to G+, chances are you have your SEO and social ducks in a row.<p>So the vast majority of content submitted to G+ already has a solid marketing strategy behind it.<p>And, Google does take G+ submission, overall submission velocity, user audience and the other typical social media metrics into account when determining how much a G+1 really matters.<p>The only reason I bring this up: So that folks reading this article don&#x27;t go onto Fiverr and start buying G+ votes.<p>Like the Facebook kerfuffle 2 years ago, whether the causal link is direct or not doesn&#x27;t really matter. A legitimate, popular G+ account, and lots of legit G+1&#x27;s on content, are super-valuable for SEO, social media and overall visibility.<p>That&#x27;s true even if your content has nothing to do with the marketing or other popular G+ niche industries, because there&#x27;s a decent population of authoritative bloggers on G+.

Snowden leaks top secret material belonging to US and UK.
US demands Snowden&#x27;s emails from Lavabit.
Lavabit shuts down.<p>pj reads news of Lavabit and concludes that email is not anonymous.  (Email was never truly anonymous, unless you count anonymous remailers.  Surely she knew this.)
pj concludes that she should shut down Groklaw.  (Why not just warn everyone that she will comply with legal requirements, like Google and myriad other web-based businesses do, for example.  Millions of people still use these services even with that warning.)
pj concludes that she should no longer use &quot;the internet&quot; (cf. email).  (Huh?  Email is but one use of the internet; it was designed ages ago and was never intended to be anonymous.)<p>Are people who leak top secret material and are wanted by US authorities sending emails to pj?  If not, then please help me understand pj&#x27;s logic.<p>If Snowden sent emails to pj, and pj, like Lavabit, does not wish to comply with authorities and hand over whatever they&#x27;ve got, then I guess shutting down Groklaw makes sense.

Every time I&#x27;ve dealt with people from their recruiting department, even the very nice ones seemed forgetful, inattentive and poor at communication. The actual Google employees who do the interviewing are on average very bright, good at actively interviewing candidates (instead of just rattling off questions), and open to answering questions, even if a couple of them were clearly inexperienced and uninterested in doing interviews.<p>I&#x27;d say the actual experience of the interview can be a good thing, but the process as a whole is a huge waste of the candidate&#x27;s time - especially if you don&#x27;t fit the stereotypical niche of what a Google employee is (4+ years of CS education, thinks writing linked lists and trees is exciting, etc. etc.) Their decision to intentionally avoid giving any feedback to candidates probably stops people from gaming the interview process, but it also makes it a net negative for candidates who don&#x27;t meet the unstated criteria Google is after - criteria that could often be screened for before a candidate ever sets foot on campus. They refuse to interview candidates for a position or a role beyond generalizations like &#x27;software engineer&#x27;, despite the huge breadth and depth of problems solved at Google - if you&#x27;re lucky they&#x27;ll quiz you on the stuff you actually know, but most likely they won&#x27;t, and the questions will be very mundane. This despite the fact that actual hiring choices ARE partitioned to some degree (as much as they seem to want to pretend they aren&#x27;t).<p>Most of the time interviewing with a good company is a &#x27;why not&#x27; scenario: The only thing you have to lose is some time, and you&#x27;ll learn some useful things from most interview experiences (even if occasionally the only thing you learn is &#x27;this company is awful&#x27;). Google&#x27;s interview process feels precisely engineered to avoid letting candidates learn anything whatsoever.<p>Companies like Microsoft or Amazon or Zynga all at least have a pretense of evaluating a candidate&#x27;s specific strengths and weaknesses to figure out whether they&#x27;re useful - if you&#x27;re a compiler engineer MS will probably have some Visual Studio/DevDiv people grill you with compiler engineering questions, if you&#x27;re a games dev Amazon will have you talk to people from their games department, and if you&#x27;re a database guy Zynga isn&#x27;t going to ask you game design questions.

For example, you can see that the newer car is heavier than the old one from the video; its front wheels still move forward when the wheels of the old one already go back. Because of that, the new car has a much longer braking distance than the old one. Things would have looked relatively better for the old car if they had chosen a collision with a concrete wall.<p>Also, Reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone</a>, the crumple zone was patented in 1952; chances are this 1959 car doesn&#x27;t have a good one.<p>If its crumple zone is bad or absent, chances are that the older car would have survived way better in a frontal collision, where the beam carrying the engine would be elastically compressed without deforming permanently.<p>That would be just the car, though; those old cars could be lethal at incredibly low speeds, for example by impaling them on their non-collapsible steering column.",1377019996

UUCP would allow encrypted envelopes that would only allow trusted nodes to decrypt enough to forward to the next destination or to the local user.<p>It would be ungainly, especially at first, and just as easy to scoop associations between users (although, not subject lines or other metadata) by tracing the limited paths.  As a critical mass were achieved (yay network effects), along with peer-to-peer sharing, you could source route your messages to anyone.<p>Given this message:<p><pre><code>  From: reeses

I could route it through the equivalent of a bang path (foo!bar!baz!bob), each step of which is a trusted node whose private key(s) I have in my routing table.  Instead of bang paths, however, the envelope could be something as simple as:<p><pre><code>  Next: baz
  Data: 
  Ardhrcbeebdhvfdhnzrfgdhvqbyber
  zvcfhz,pbafrpgrghe,nqvcvfpviryvg

baz would receive the &quot;Ardhrcbeebdhvfdhnzrfgdhvqbyberzvcfhzdhvnqbybefvgnzrg,pbafrpgrghe,nqvcvfpviryvg&quot; blob and unwrap it, forwarding it to bob, who would have exchanged keys with reeses.<p>Multipath routing and multiple recipient support would be possible by having additional Next: headers and the encrypted blob would serve as a sufficient identifier, or input into an identifier generator, to deduplicate messages if a transmission fork were coalesced.<p>This is off the top of my head, so it&#x27;s wrong in a bunch of ways, but it&#x27;s a simple model that could easily be deployed among circles of people who need a degree of anonymity.  As in the later days of UUCP, with comp.mail.maps and the like mapping a combination of FQDNs to named hosts, initial, intermediate, or terminal nodes could involve forwarding over (E)SMTP.  (foo!{bar|baz}|quux|reeses@example.com) would route through a number of machines, and the message in my inbox would look like the following:<p><pre><code>  From: POSTMASTER@quux.com

I once launched a product and did $300K in the first week of sales and created a 10K list, all driven by affiliates, all from scratch, offering 50% commissions to affiliates.  I got most of the affiliates myself through networking at marketing conferences and also had an affiliate manager, who helped get more.<p>Normally an affiliate manager works on a 10% commission, though that is just recruiting and managing affiliates - I don&#x27;t know what else they are planning to do for you.  I question 50%, but if your product needs to be positioned better, sales site done, etc, perhaps it makes sense. If all they are doing is putting you on ClickBank, then you are being hosed.  A really good affiliate manager is in high demand.<p>The &quot;scam marketing&quot; thing is accurate, though 95% of your sales will probably come from the top 20 affiliates, so you can simple work directly with people who are likely to be the op 20 and set your rules and exclude everyone else.  You can also make it very clear that if certain rules are broken, commissions will be forfeit.<p>It&#x27;s preferable to use your brand name as your affiliates will build it up for you.  Good affiliates will provide honest reviews and add value.  Bad affiliates will hurt your brand.<p>Slightly unrelated, udemy.com might be something worth looking into.",1377018295

That should be enough to create large shared mailboxen among several hundred random people that lasts about a month at a time, at the end of which your mail program would automatically mail all the people in your address book at their anonymous addresses informing them of the next large anonymous mailbox you&#x27;ll be using with other people.<p>Everyday, your mailclient would download the entirety of all new encrypted messages for your peer group and would parse out your messages using your private key.<p>Let&#x27;s say that every shared mailbox is capped at 10GB of total shared mailbox space. Every peer in the swarm using that mailbox replicates that mailbox. Once that mailbox hits 9GB of total messages, your client attaches to a new 10GB mailbox being created with a random set of N strangers. It then takes the address of that new mailbox and mails all your contacts a special kind of &quot;update your address book&quot; message with a new mailbox address and a new private key. Upon receiving that message, their client now knows to send any messages addressed to you to the new mailbox and use a new private key.<p>This approach makes it nearly impossible to perform social network analysis because your address essentially betweens a cross between that shared box and your private key that only you have.<p>There has been work done de-anonymizing alt.anonymous.messages [0], but a lot of the attacks all relied on the small number of participants on alt.anonymous.messages using that same shared mailbox over many many years. At scale with many more participants and automatic mailbox rotation, these types of attacks become far more difficult.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ritter.vg/blog-deanonymizing_amm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ritter.vg/blog-deanonymizing_amm.html</a>",1377018208

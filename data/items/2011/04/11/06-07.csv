You're right that that would help quite a bit.<p>According to Ralf Brown's interrupt list, <a href=""http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2554.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2554.htm</a>, MS-DOS 1.0 did not support redirecting standard output; that was a feature added in MS-DOS 2.0, which didn't come out until 1983: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_x86_DOS_operating_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_x86_DOS_operating_s...</a><p>So if you really had to solve this problem on 1982 MS-DOS, you'd need to open an output file with a file control block and INT 21 with AH=0F. (And if you really can't type NUL bytes on the keyboard, I think you are going to have to write some code to zero out most of the FCB at start time, too. Ick.)<p>This program might solve that problem for MS-DOS 2+, although I haven't tested it yet, and you'd have to use something like JKLMNO instead of ABCDEF for your hex digits past 9:<p><pre><code>     100:	b4 01                	mov    $0x1,%ah\n     102:	cd 21                	int    $0x21\n     104:	24 0f                	and    $0xf,%al\n     106:	88 c2                	mov    %al,%dl\n     108:	c0 e2 04             	shl    $0x4,%dl\n     10b:	cd 21                	int    $0x21\n     10d:	24 0f                	and    $0xf,%al\n     10f:	08 c2                	or     %al,%dl\n     111:	b4 02                	mov    $0x2,%ah\n     113:	cd 21                	int    $0x21\n     115:	eb e9                	jmp    100 <loop>\n\n    kragen@VOSTRO9:~/devel/misc$ xxd < hexconverter.com\n    0000000: b401 cd21 240f 88c2 c0e2 04cd 2124 0f08  ...!$.......!$..\n    0000010: c2b4 02cd 21eb e9                        ....!..\n    kragen@VOSTRO9:~/devel/misc$ od -t u1 < hexconverter.com\n    0000000 180   1 205  33  36  15 136 194 192 226   4 205  33  36  15   8\n    0000020 194 180   2 205  33 235 233\n    0000027\n</code></pre>\nI think you could probably create that program successfully with COPY CON in not very many tries, but it's not much better than COPY CON itself.

A few decades ago, most of what you needed to learn to be productive in society was best learned at a university. Today, most of the what you need to learn to be productive in society is best learned on your own, online, for free. There are exceptions but 99% of human knowledge is no longer locked up within a university.<p>Contrast that with the cost of higher education.To go to UCLA as an out-of-state student it now costs $50K/year (<a href=""http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/budget.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/budget.htm</a>). And that's a <i>public</i> school. And it's rising 8% a year. So the cost of learning has plummeted to almost nothing and yet 18-22 year old kids are taking out six figure loans to ""learn"". This makes no sense and feels very unsustainable.<p>And here's what I think will change the game: alternative signaling and credentialing mechanisms. When universities no longer have a monopoly (or near-monopoly) on signaling/credentialing we'll witness a sea change. I'd offer that this is already starting to happen in certain parts of industry. Would you rather hire an engineer with a lot of GitHub followers, a great reputation on Stack Overflow and/or someone who is a Y Combinator alum or would you rather higher a Stanford or MIT grad? It's a bit of a toss-up for many people to answer that and given that the comparison is Stanford/MIT and not the 4,000 ""lesser"" schools, that says something.<p>This change won't happen overnight but Thiel is on the money here. Higher ed is a $500 billion industry in the U.S. alone and I think its value proposition has never been more questionable than it is today.",1302502579

If you contact bloggers and media about your new product and encourage them to write about you and link to you, is that SEO?<p>Maybe you call it that.

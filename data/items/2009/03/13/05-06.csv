This is one of those times.<p>I had somebody from Microsoft once tell me, in apparent seriousness, that I should cloudify my program.  Because it would offer me unprecedented scalability and uptime, and let my customers access their data from anywhere.<p><i>sigh</i>  You see this tool right here?  It is called a hammer.  It is useful for many things.  You see this problem right here?  It is an ingrown toe-nail.  Please do not attempt to fix the ingrown toe-nail with the hammer.  It will not work out well.",1236923765

Linksys routers are based on Linux, but that's no secret.<p>Cisco branded products run some form of IOS, and IOS has always been Cisco secret sauce.  A few years ago, some IOS source code was stolen and parts were made public.  I think if any of it contained Linux kernel code the Internet would have erupted into fury.<p>On a somewhat related point, Juniper JunOS is based on a BSD variant (FreeBSD I think), but there is no way to know how much is BSD and how much was developed by Juniper.  It's a consequence of the BSD license.",1236923608

Why is YCombinator the only place to go?<p>This <i>has</i> been done plenty of times, and Y Combinator isn't the only place to go.  There's <i>lots</i> of places/people you can go to in order to get < $100k of startup capital.<p>You only know about YCombinator because they have invested a lot of time and money into marketing their brand as a startup incubator.  I know that term has fallen out of fashion since the go-go 1990's, but that's exactly what they are.  Paul Graham writes essays and publishes them to the internet, he's involved with open source, you're reading his marketing BBS right now, etc.<p>Get out of your apartment and start networking with people with money.

If it is your first time writing a site, you may end up having to scrap it and go to the beginning (with experience you may be able to come up with a rough plan beforehand).<p>Facebook started out as a crude website and Zuckerberg even wrote a blog post admitting that. If you go to archive.org and look it up then obviously the creator had a limited skillset.<p>Don't get overwhelmed. Come up with an idea. If your mind wanders about all of the future possibilities, write them all down and then say, ""At the core, what is this site?"" Program what that core is. In your example, it is just what you said: start with creating user accounts, then allow users to have profile pages, then maybe comments, and finally be able to add friends. Just start coding and you will learn a lot.",1236922341

There's already too many.<p>I'm a System Administrator who was just made redundant and given my 2 weeks notice. I have a very wide range of Linux/Windows administration experience, but I'm a weak programmer (dabbled in python/php/objective C) who hasn't really coded since I graduated (Computer Science) in 2004.<p>I'm using twitter as an example because it's the most basic site I can think of. People register accounts, they post an update. Friends can see these updates. How would someone with my level of experience create something like this? Where would you start? Brushing up on coding is obvious, but when I read about twitter and facebook having APIs and things people can use to interact with them it goes so over my head I wouldn't know where to begin.<p>I know I could make the basics of the site in php without too much effort, but anything to do with security / providing an API / distributed programming (if required?) is all foreign to me.<p>Any comments really appreciated, it's more of a curiosity than a ""I'm so going to make something better than twitter/facebook"" idea someone might be attempting to execute.

Why should I?""<p>You claim you don't want to use inferior tools, and then claim Microsoft Power Point as a non-inferior tool?<p>BWA-HAHAHAHA!<p>Maybe if she said Keynote I could take her seriously.<p>I also find it amusing that she thinks the fact that she can use Facebook and IM makes her some kind of technological genius.  And, no, I don't find an inability to find a book in the library a sign of intelligence.  I don't think someone who doesn't think reading books is worthwhile should be making snide comments about other people's intelligence.  Just yesterday the NYTimes reported on a study that basically said we're getting dumber because we don't read enough.  Not just in reading skills, but even Math and Science.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/arts/19nea.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/arts/19nea.htm</a><p>So maybe Gen Y. needs to put down the cell phone, log off of Facebook and start reading a book before their IQ drops any farther than it already has.",1195620957

82342,comment,81976,81976,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I have been looking around for partners for the last few months and ran across something very interesting.<p>
Three guys, on three different occasions, said they wanted to go linux or nothing. Note that all of these conversations had nothing to do with the question of whether the business was viable or whether it could turn a profit. On a couple of occasions, we had some really good chemistry and the plan was looking hot. But they were convinced that ANY business idea that ran on .NET was a bad one.<p>
I've never had somebody say it had to be .NET or nothing. I'm not sure what that means, but there it is. It doesn't make much sense to me from a business standpoint.",1195619078

And these are only published papers.<p>The CGI spec was defined and implemented (in NCSA httpd) in the late '93/early '94 timeframe by Rob McCool. The WHOLE purpose of CGI was to enable people to create ""web applications"". It is highly unlikely that there were no other ""web applications"" in the 18 months between the birth of CGI and Viaweb, considering the sheer amount of intellectual horsepower and entrepreneurial fervor at that time aimed at harnessing the net.<p>I think the claim is pretty shaky.<p>That said, you guys were definitely among the early pioneers. You built a great product and had a great exit. What more could you ask for? :)",1195618926

You can't use muscle memory for the system because the target x,y positions and sizes change based on how zoomed in you are. Worse, the ZUI doesn't solve the biggest bottleneck in the existing GUI canon - asking the user to arrange and keep track of his own crap. His ZUI concept is like the mac or windows desktop, except now you get a magnifying glass. <p>The better method is search, or more accurately, comprehension, but this is a grail quest, and my solution isn't done yet.",1195617923

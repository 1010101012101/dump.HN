4399721,comment,4398979,4398979,5,0,justin_vanw,,,"Luckily this sort of thing rarely happens.  The reason is that you need great engineers to trust you if you want to succeed.  By founding a startup you are taking great personal risk, but your employees are also taking some of that risk with you.  Most startups pay (very very) below market salaries, and bring employees up to parity with a much less terrible place to work (very few very bright people would prefer to work in at a big company), and by giving out options.<p>I suspect that the CEO and other high level managers at this company will have serious trouble recruiting the next time they want to start something new, because they now have nothing to offer.  Nobody is going to trust their promises, stock options they issue will be seen as basically worthless (since everyone will think they are likely to be screwed out of them), so they will have to pay market rates (which is probably 2x-6x what startups generally pay in total compensation).<p>If I were a founder of a company, and I were faced with this choice, I would probably rather let the company fold than cash out (or in this case probably just not go under) while leaving employees behind.  Failure is rarely punished in the valley, but nowhere is dishonesty or double dealing more likely to be recognized and rejected.",1345251506

Even then, the trolls will continue to decimate independent developers and occasionally catch a big fish for hundreds of millions of dollars until the patent system is reformed to exclude obvious and previously invented items.<p>So far, Google and Samsung seem to be willing to talk about ending the mutual destruction and Apple is recalcitrant.

Probability of buying a block of k tickets where all are winners is p^k (where ^ is the exponent operator, double asterisk in Python, pow() function in many other languages).<p>2. Probability of buying a block of k tickets with at least one loser is thus 1-p^k.<p>3. If we buy n blocks, the probability that all of them contain at least one loser is (1-p^k)^n.<p>If our hunch is correct, how many blocks of k do we have to buy and scratch, verifying each and every block contains at least one loser, to prove it to confidence level c?<p>1-c = (1-p^k)^n<p>-> log(1-c) = n log(1-p^k)<p>-> n = log(1-c) / log(1-p^k)<p>For p=1/5, k=4, here are the numbers:<p>Confidence     Blocks<p>90%            1438<p>95%            1871<p>99%            2876<p>99.5%          3309<p>99.9%          4314<p>So if 4-blocks are never produced, and tickets cost $1, you'd have to spend roughly $6000-$18000 to prove it (the more expensive testing gives more convincing evidence).<p>For 5-blocks, those numbers go up to $36000-$108000.<p>For 6-blocks, the numbers are $44000-$130000.<p>These numbers are initial outlay for the tickets, and don't account for the fact that you'll have winnings which you'll use to recoup costs.<p>You'd have to use more sophisticated modeling to account for drawing-with-replacement effects if you knew that manufacturers produce the same number of winners in each print run.  (I believe they actually do this.)<p>Chi-squared tests are a more sophisticated tool you might use, but they're sort of a black box magic formula, whereas it's easy to understand the fundamentals of the method above.<p>Our protocol is rather weak in that it only recognizes a rejection of your hypothesis when a group of k winners is aligned on a k-ticket boundary in your purchase history.  By considering a better protocol which takes into account unaligned groups of k winners, you could probably substantially reduce the cost of the experiment, but I'm now out of <i>my</i> depth ^_^",1345251454

With these touch devices, the barrier feels smaller and in some cases so good as to be non-existent - i.e. our natural ability to figure out things in the real world by poking and prodding is what is being carried over into the digital world this time.<p>SJ said ""it feels great to be able to touch your music"" (or something like that) when he showed cover flow on the iphone.

Way back in 2003, a local friend recommended that all of the parents in my homeschooling support group read pg's essay ""Why Nerds Are Unpopular."" She seemed to know of pg's name from his contributions to the Internet research community (of which she was part), but I had never heard of him. I read and thought about the essay, and in 2005 a friend recommended that I read ""What You'll Wish You'd Known,"" which I have since recommended to each of my children as they approach high school age, and have often recommended to friends. As I heard about more Paul Graham essays, I learned to browse around his personal site and at some point followed a link to ""News,"" which links here. At first I only lurked on what was then called Startup News, but by November 2008 I had an account here, which has become quite active.

Both posts were x000 words so minimum reading was over 3-5 minutes (average time on site was 1.5 minutes so not everyone read to the end).<p>Both times neither posts got any upvotes until half way down the first page. They were surrounded by topical submissions, news or etc. Stuff that either had a simple message in the title or was only a few paragraphs long.<p>Except a strange phenomenon occured when the posts fell to the second page, readership doubled. Whereas on the first page Google analytics real time reported 10-14 active readers this jumped to the low 20s. By this time the posts had received 5 upvotes. On page 1 they were maybe the 4-5th most upvoted submission but once they reached the 2nd page they stole 1st or 2nd place among their non-frontpaged peers.<p>The lesson I took away from this is that short or topical submissions have a strong advantage.

If violence was hard to simulate, and the only way to create images of violence was to hurt or possibly kill someone, I think we'd be much more likely to treat images of violence in the same way as we treat images of child abuse.<p>In the end, I think your argument may hold for fabricated or animated images of child abuse, but fails to do so for images of actual abuse.  AFAIK, most images in circulation now are of actual children, and as such, we prosecute all images as if they were.",1345249052

Ever hear of a thing called history? by this statement I can see that you have not. History tells us that our car-based society allows for more opportunity for the social underclass rather than the opposite.<p>If you think that funding for schools in poor areas is the problem with our education system - you are out of touch with reality. I grew up in one of those areas and observed first hand the problem. It is not that the children do not have the opportunity to study and get good grades, go to college and get out of poverty.... The problem is that the kids are lazy and they aren't pushed by their parent(s) to do their homework and study. They get into trouble on the streets or play video games instead, girls get pregnant and go on welfare as single moms, guys do drugs and join gangs ending up in jail. Then they blame white people for their problems.<p>I know this by observation. Why isn't anyone asking the students who come out of these areas with decent to good grades and make something out of themselves. Everyone has their theory but no one wants to hold the parents of these kids accountable. I personally think that parents should be punished if their children don't do well in school, have continual behavioral problems or commit crimes. Cut off the welfare and restrict these parents and their families to living in a shelter and eating bread and water (no money for cable tv, alcohol and ciggies). It is not a good solution, but it is the only solution that will work. No amount of money via welfare or social programs will ever bring the black community out of the continuum they are stuck in.<p>The Hispanic community has another problem. Most of them are from Mexico or are second generation. The immigrants are usually much better off financially than they were in Mexico even if they are making $6 an hour mowing lawns. Their kids often cannot speak English very well and don't think that that they should have to put in more work than their English speaking counterparts to stay at the same level. Often their parents both work very long hours and do not appreciate the value of their kids education. They like the black parents (but for different reasons) do not require a high level of effort from their kids in regards to education. Again, their has to be consequences for these parents. Investigate the parents of children who never do their homework or are clearly not giving much effort in school. Warn them, then if things don't improve - deport them. I think that we would see quite a lot better grades from Mexicans overnight if this policy was implemented.<p>If parents don't know how to motivate their children - offer them parenting classes.",1345248078

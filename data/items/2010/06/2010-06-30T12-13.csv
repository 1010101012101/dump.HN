1474651,comment,1474315,1474315,0,0,marknutter,,,"Here's how I was able to get pretty good at design:<p>Every day, visit a variety of CSS galleries and make sure to view at least 100 designs, saving the ones you like the best.<p>Start a personal website if you don't already have one, and begin creating mockups in Photoshop or Fireworks of what you want it to look like. Most likely, you will be unhappy with what you create more often than not, but it's important that you keep iterating.<p>When you finally create a design you personally like, subject it to outside criticism from designers who know their stuff. Do not take anything they say personally. They will probably rail on you about typography, whitespace, the grid system, proper color matching, and so on. Go through the process of fixing your design to address those critiques.<p>Last, and most importantly, redesign. Although I think that there is an element to design that's innate, I would argue that it's mostly about practice and pattern recognition. It's all about being able to pick out the best designs and have your opinions match up with the largest percentage of the population as possible.<p>Most of good design is just re-applying the best elements of other people's designs. Truly innovative design is a rare thing and hard to pull off. It's a bit like fashion or modern art - most people will balk at truly creative stuff, but it can make it into the mainstream with enough persistence.<p>TL;DR view css galleries obsessively and save your favorites, perpetually redesign a personal site, frequently ask for feedback from other great designers, accept criticism gracefully, practice, practice, practice.",1277902118

My personal data access code snippets use a lot of reflection to figure out what stored procedures to call without me having to specify too much metadata (going with the DRY principle). I started working at a new company and brought the code with me, where the resident ""alpha nerd"" criticized it, ""all that reflection must be slow."" I just smiled and did what I wanted to do anyway (I now outrank him) and showed the proof in the pudding: the ~50ms that the code spends in reflecting on its own stack trace is completely dwarfed by the overhead of connecting to the database, waiting on stored procedures to execute, transferring data over the network, and processing result sets into suitable outputs.<p>We typically write apps for 10 to 50 users; our complexity is in reporting, not request throughput. There's no good way to get around having to outer join on 10 different legacy tables of non-normalized data (which is that way because of some cheese-head early-optimizer who hasn't worked here in three years) to get the report that the client insists is absolutely needed regardless of being unable to come up with some sort of business case.",1277901816

It's just about paying attention to a few basic moral imperatives, namely integrity; if a person has a history of adultery, that person is not likely to be a trustworthy resource. That person is willing to destroy the lives and hearts of his family for fleeting personal sexual gain. Why do you think such a person wouldn't be willing to trade the well-being of your company or other employees if the right personal incentives materialized? An adulterer is pretty much the most selfish kind of person you can find.<p>Of course adulterers and other people can still do good things. Everyone is capable of doing good. I am merely saying that I wouldn't invest the resources into hiring an adulterer because adulterers prove that they are suspicious and untrustworthy by committing adultery. There are plenty of non-adulterers out there that are safer investments, even if it costs me a bit of CPU time.",1277900701

When you get to your 30s you can work from your strengths, but there has to be some time in your life to work on shit you suck at, and for me it was when I had the most motivation, my 20s.</i><p>Concentrate on your strengths, even at this age.  Peter Drucker's argument sold me:  If you work on your weaknesses, the best you can be is, if you're lucky, acceptable.  If you on your strengths, however, you have your best shot at being outstanding.

The first thing that jumped out at me when I reached the end was &quot;there&#x27;s no way this would ever work.&quot;<p>I am a Swype user and love the product, but I&#x27;m reasonably fast at typing on it because I know the QWERTY layout like the back of my hand. Switching to a new layout would bring me back to a crawl. I&#x27;d probably be better off typing on a 9-digit pre-smartphone keypad at that point.<p>Cool things to consider though. I love the idea of an alternate and more efficient keyboard, but at around 140wpm, the idea of mentally and physically training myself to learn a new one at this stage in the game is sub-optimal.",1428695976

There are a number of ways to interact with the HostConfiguration.Service<T>() method and its overloads, but there&#x27;s only one tiny section in the documentation.<p>TBH, I think you might want to deprecate that whole way of using TopShelf. Using ServiceControl is much much easier and better documented.

I wont argue it&#x27;s going to give you the same level of cardiovascular conditioning as running daily, but it absolutely gives you a baseline of cardiovascular conditioning.  Since we are talking about basic fitness, I would still hold to my recommendation that strength is the most important thing for the first few months, <i>especially</i> for a sedentary population that is likely to hurt themselves doing high impact running.  I would agree that after those first few months cardiovascular fitness should be considered, and in fact most strength programs include conditioning as well.  Starting strength does not because it&#x27;s not meant to be run for more than a few months before going into intermediate programs that do in fact contain conditioning.<p>> there is also no evidence for the preventative benefits of heavy lifting. for the average person who starts lifting to feel and look better, starting strength makes no sense<p>Re: evidence of preventative benefits, I&#x27;d suggest reading this article <a href=""http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/article/barbell_training_is_big_medicine#.VSgoMxPF-8s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/article/barbell_t...</a>  Re: looking better, this thread is not about that...so...<p>> it is sub optimal for increasing mass<p>On the contrary, given a year and body building goals I would absolutely be recommending strength based training for a great amount of that time.  I suggest you read Practical Programming which goes into detail about why this is, but the short version is myofibrilar hypertrophy vs. sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is a very real difference, and the former is far more important for mass during the novice phase, and for allowing the latter to be quickly added during intermediate phases.<p>>  requires rapid and unhealthy weight gain for progression for many trainees...<p>This is a pretty poor understanding of the starting strength program and its nutritional recommendations.  Have you read the book or just internet forums like /r/fitness where idiots talk about it?<p>> even if you don&#x27;t agree with all my points, at least ask yourself if it makes sense to recommend a highly specific sports training routine to everyone looking for basic fitness advice.<p>If you think starting strength is a sports training routine then you do not understand the basic principals of the program or the philosophy.  Please respond to my initial justification, which is that strength is the basis of <i>all</i> fitness and provides gains in every area, as well as the fact that I explicitly recommend a short period of time for strength training.",1428695833

Someone in Japan will post raw scans of comics they got at Comiket; another anonymous person will offer translations in-thread; another anonymous person will clean up the scans and do the lettering with the new translation and post the updated pages. These translations will often go through multiple iterations of people with varying levels of proficiency in Japanese discussing and correcting the translations, and then finally the finished translated and cleaned up pages will be uploaded to a site somewhere ready for consumption. This is often done completely with no one knowing the identity of anyone else in-thread.<p>It is an amazing example of the potential of ubiquitous Internet and low-barrier web technology facilitating sharing culture resulting in a final product that would be superior to any commercial offering, if such a product was even offered for sale which it often is not.

9356712,comment,9354195,9356353,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> NATO is basically the US, France, Germany, and the UK.<p>I&#x27;d definitely add Turkey to that. Has more duty members than anyone but the US. More aircraft than anyone but the US. More ships than anyone but the US. More armored than Germany, UK and France combined. They may not all be as high-tech, but it&#x27;s quite capable, and has nuclear capacity (though no capability right now, like Germany). Beyond being one of the most interesting partners from a geographic perspective.<p>> The US economy is now nine times the size of Russia&#x27;s, and that gap will only continue to expand - there&#x27;s only so much military threat a country can pose when it has an economy that is going to eventually be ~8% your size.<p>And yet, Russia is a Nuclear power, a regional power and has a UN security council seat. And it has better ties with US&#x27;s backyard in a number of South American countries, as it does with the regional power in the Middle East: Iran, which will only grow its influence now that its counterweight Iraq is ruined, and the Shia majority of Iraq welcomes, to an extent, Iran for security and stability, much like Hezbollah started out in Lebanon.<p>That means it can&#x27;t attack Russia head on (because nuclear), it can employ sanctions, but Russia&#x27;s economy is relatively sturdy because its main export product is relatively easy to sell (fossil fuels, Europe simply needs them one way or another), compared to economies reliant on exporting less crucial products. Russia is able to regionally trespass international law, and Nato is unlikely to fight it militarily, and while economic sanctions do hurt (a lot), Russia is still a market economy with economic partners, and has an export product in high demand.<p>So while I agree, Russia is far from the most powerful force, the game is definitely not over and Russia is still a major player and it&#x27;ll likely continue to be. Especially in a world where China is balancing the playing field. (e.g. its economic/infrastructure led push into South American politics, again, America&#x27;s backyard, or acting as a trade partner for sanctioned economies).<p>Fact is, a military means less in a nuclear age where direct confrontation is rare and economic/cyber/guerrilla options take priority. Especially when you have large economic blocks that all employ market economies outside of the US/EU, that can provide trade partnerships for sanctioned economies. Cuba was able to easily survive when it had the Soviets as a trade partner in the 50s or 60s. But as the Soviets had no market economy to grow its economy and Cuba was sanctioned to hell and back, it became stagnant. Today, a country like Iran is sanctioned similarly, but it can survive and even thrive, its population grows, its economy advances (somewhat, slowly), its military grows, its political influence grows fast in the region, and it works towards a nuclear bomb, despite harsh sanctions. It&#x27;s because the US cannot simply invade it, nor twist the whole world&#x27;s arm to stop all trade. Non-aligned countries, Russia and China, and neighbouring countries, all continue to trade with Iran, whether officially or not, legally or covertly.<p>The US power is not going away anytime soon, and it&#x27;s true that it is more powerful than ever. Fact is, the same can be said of many other countries. Russia is much stronger today than anytime in the past 30 years or so. As is China, as is Iran, and South America has never been so independent of US influence as today. Paradoxically, the US may have already lost the long-term game despite the fact I agree with you, it&#x27;s never been this powerful in a way.",1428695335

9356679,comment,9355233,9355649,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"With TLS, it&#x27;s not safe <i>not</i> to! Let me explain:<p>Diffie-Hellman requires the group order to have at least one large prime factor: if it has only small prime factors, Silver–Pohlig–Hellman could recover keys, and that&#x27;ll make you a sad panda. The easiest way to ensure this is to select a Sophie Germain prime <i>q</i> with 2<i>q</i>+1 also being prime (a &quot;safe prime&quot;), of about the right size. Any base <i>g</i> can then be used - almost always 2 - which then generates a subgroup of large prime order <i>q</i>, problem solved.<p>The problem is that testing for safe primality is <i>way</i> too slow (as you may have noticed while running openssl dhparam!) for TLS clients to test DHE parameters presented to them. So… they don&#x27;t. The risk is (I&#x27;m not totally clear if the Finished master-secret might prevent this, but there certainly isn&#x27;t as much transcript hashing as I&#x27;d <i>like</i>!) an attacker could perhaps trick TLS parties into accepting bad parameters: too small; small factors; hell, maybe even composite.<p>The solution is currently in draft, and is to have carefully-selected, standard Diffie-Hellman parameters that are known safe primes, starting from 2048-bit and going up (don&#x27;t use <2048-bit, just… don&#x27;t - <i>please</i> don&#x27;t use 1024-bit!), using essentially the same negotiation as that used with the supported-curves extension. <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-negotiated-ff-dhe/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-negotiated-f...</a> It&#x27;s the same approach used by many other protocols, including SSH and IKE.<p>I gather TLS 1.3 will remove the ability for server-defined Diffie-Hellman parameters completely for this reason.<p>However, ECDHE is strongly technically superior to DHE: ECDHE using secp256r1 is at around ≈128-bit workfactor, equivalent to broadly ≈3072-bit DHE, but is <i>much</i> faster and smaller and doesn&#x27;t have these problems (it can have different problems, but not <i>these</i> problems!).<p>And coming up soon (via the CFRG sausage-machine) hopefully TLS will soon have djb&#x27;s Curve25519 (the curve, and the key agreement function now known as X25519), which is roughly the same ≈128-bit strength but <i>really fast</i> - and much simpler to safely implement, even in constant-time. You probably want to use that or ECDHE, not DHE, which is a little hairier than it sounds. Indeed, quite a few people are using it already (notably OpenSSH).",1428695031

The hardware market has changed.<p>In the 80s / 90s, computers were very expensive and it was common to only buy exactly what you needed. PCs excelled at this. Everything was an option: Video card (MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA), ram, hard drive, hard drive controller, serial port controller, sound card. If you later needed more capabilities you upgraded whatever was necessary.<p>As computers became cheaper, upgrading began to make less financial sense. Upgrading a component and paying for it to be installed became almost equal to the cost of a new computer. There also became less to upgrade, onboard sound, network, etc was good enough. The only thing left to upgrade was CPU (but usually required a new motherboard) and video card. Upgradability which was originally a huge selling point became a niche feature.<p>As integration continued, size, weight, power consumption all became more important than upgradability / customization. Hardware wise, all Android phones and the iPhone are pretty much the same.",1428694824

Why did people think that their defensive patent license was somehow worse than the industry standard (the MIT or BSD copyright license with no patent license, which made patent rights murky at best)?<p>But this new language eliminates the major limitation on the original language, which was that the license would be terminated if you attempted to invalidate one of Facebook&#x27;s patents or defensively argued that it was invalid or unenforceable (or even, according to a strict though implausible reading of the language, if you publicly stated that the patent was invalid).<p>Glad to see Facebook paying attention, even if the original complaint was overblown.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271246"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271246</a>",1428694699

In other words, if the Sun suddenly turned into a black hole right now, we would not get &quot;sucked&quot; into it.  The Earth would continue orbiting at the same period and distance.  Of course, it would suck (no pun intended) not to have sunlight but hey, maybe the energy emitted by the accretion disc would equal the energy output of the sun :P!  Of course, an accretion disc would probably take a while to form, so we would probably be fucked anyway, but certainly not because we would be sucked into the black hole.<p>Similarly, if the LHC created a black hole through its collisions, I can&#x27;t see how it would be that massive.  If it&#x27;s not very massive, then it&#x27;s not a threat.  In fact, there are theories that support the notion that it would evaporate rather quickly (via Hawking radiation).

It&#x27;s 3 exercises 3 times per week. 15 sets total per gym session (not counting warm-up sets).<p>The whole point is to start with a very low weight (empty bar) and work your way up by adding 2.5lbs to each side every time you go back in. It&#x27;s the fastest linear progression workout for beginners.<p>From my experience, Strong Lifts 5x5 is the recommended beginner&#x27;s workout. You need a solid base to start off with. and 5x5 gets you there the quickest, because you are doing compound lifts. Biggest gym noob mistake is to go in there and start doing isolation exercises, when you are already lacking a base. That causes muscle imbalances which can then result in tendon and joint issues.<p>Edit: Just wanted to add that the 5x5 can transition into 3x5 and then 1x5 as you move up in weight and plateau.

It rests on the idea that the the recommended Caloric intake of 2000 Cal/day is likely wrong for you. It might be right but for a lot of people it&#x27;s probably off.<p>tl;dr if the above doesn&#x27;t apply to you.<p>Annoyed by increasing workouts and limited results I took to data cataloging my metabolism to find weak points in my diet. What I found was that I burn less than 2000 Cal in one day when I&#x27;m just doing my regular day to day activities. Meaning if I eat the typical diet I gain weight steadily until my mass is actually consuming all those extra calories and I&#x27;m slightly overweight.<p>Procedure:<p>Take about 1 week of data, don&#x27;t change your lifestyle for that week do what you normally would do. Your body responds in about a 1 day cycle and you need about a week to get a clear trend.<p>Record your weight/date-time once to twice a day at the same times, like morning and evening. Preferably without too much clothing so it doesn&#x27;t throw off the numbers.<p>Use some app or a notebook and note every single thing you eat, and I mean everything. You eat a peanut that counts, you have coffee that counts, all of it.<p>Record any excess exercise you do as well, like a 20min run or biking. Things you do as extra to work out. Compute the Calories this is worth.<p>End of the week plot your weight and draw a trend line, the slope/day is what you want to know how many pounds per day are you gaining or loosing.<p>Compute the Calories per day you ate minus the calories burned on exercise, and get the Average.  Hopefully you didn&#x27;t eat wildly different amounts each day that can throw things off a bit.<p>&quot;3500 calories equals one pound of body weight&quot; => compute the calories from the slope (lb/day) computed earlier if it&#x27;s positive subtract that from the average caloric intake, if it&#x27;s negative add it.<p>This is you&#x27;re baseline Caloric burn rate per day. Meaning if you do your day to day stuff and eat this much you will neither gain or loose weight. If you&#x27;re trying to loose weight and don&#x27;t have time or interest in working out you can just cut anywhere from 100-300-500 Cal from your day to day diet and it&#x27;ll slowly go down. More than 500 Cal is typically difficult unless you balance it with also working out. Anything over a deficit of 1000 Cal is usually considered unsafe.<p>The only reason for cardio is to strengthen your heart and keep your blood vessels clear (and so you don&#x27;t get winded going up stairs), but a 20+min run 2-3 times a week or even some sport activity can solve that.",1428693416

It&#x27;s going to shrink strictly based on out-of-the-ground production.<p>But the oil companies aren&#x27;t huge, they&#x27;re gigantic.  And they&#x27;re not going to just roll over and die.  If tomorrow someone gets a working LFTR going you can be sure that all the majors are going to spend a LOT of money trying to buy said company and scale it up.<p>And the oil companies already own tremendous amounts of assets re: liquid fuels so they&#x27;d just start plopping reactors down in the middle of their plants and start producing DME (for diesel) or whatever the gas equivalent is out of various feedstocks.<p>It&#x27;d take a decade or two to finally make the transition, but I really think that&#x27;s where things are going.  The oil companies regularly spend billions getting leases on land, drilling, production assets, etc.  To spend $10b (or $100b even) on buying a &#x27;safe nuclear&#x27; technology to avoid going out of business I suspect wouldn&#x27;t generate too many waves.<p>So they&#x27;ll be sort-of reinvented, but still largely themselves.  The majors aren&#x27;t necessarily oil companies anymore, but energy companies.  We&#x27;re going to see them slowly change or die, but I suspect most will transition successfully just because they have so much money under &quot;management&quot; that it&#x27;ll be hard to screw up too badly.",1428693213

I also never had to worry about constipation or being overweight anymore.<p>Before changing my diet, I used to get sick at least 4 times per year (sore throat, sinus infections, headache). Now it&#x27;s extremely rare. In fact, since 2008, I got sick only once, which I attributed to stress, since it happened a couple of days after I broke up from a long term relationship.<p>The core of my diet consists of beans (mostly black beans, Brazilian style) and brown rice. I add potatoes or sweet potatoes for certain periods of time, specially when I&#x27;m working out consistently and want more fuel. For breakfast I have either a simple smoothie (banana, peanut butter, spinach, almond milk) or oatmeal with berries.<p>Since I&#x27;m vegan for ethical reasons, I don&#x27;t obsess over what I eat. I eat what I eat because it&#x27;s convenient (my batch of black beans lasts 5 or 6 days), inexpensive and tastes good. I do eat some processed comfort foods, mostly on weekends, like vegan meats, pizza, ice-cream, veggie burgers, grilled &quot;cheese&quot;, etc., but I don&#x27;t notice any negative effect when I do.<p>If I&#x27;m out of town and eating on restaurants a lot, I notice that my energy levels drop and my BMs get messed up.",1428692887

In addition, he has a score for &quot;consensus&quot;--which is a virtual contestant which predicts each category winner based on the most popular pick. For example, if 30 people picked Birdman and 20 picked Boyhood, consensus would pick Birdman.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. A few people usually beat consensus in a given year. However, over the course of 25 years, no single person has a better average score than consensus and, in fact, not even a small panel of those who (retrospectively) were the best pickers do.<p>As others have said, in contests like how many jellybeans are in a jar, the median or mean tends to do better than the vast majority of individuals as well.",1428692887

Younger workers have less experience and many times propose ideas that just won&#x27;t work in the long-run or have been tried multiple times and failed.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean all their ideas should be dismissed.<p>&quot;Employees need to feel their opinions are heard and valued, and this is especially true for Millennials.&quot;<p>&quot;In other words, we have recognition insecurities and sometimes wonder if the appreciation we receive is as artificial as our boxes full of trophies still sitting at home.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s so funny how years ago when I heard in school that everyone got a trophy and competition was pretty much banned in many schools that everyone said it was for the better.

Volume, usually defined using tonnage (weight x reps x sets) at a certain intensity (% of your maximal strength) is the main predictor not only of hypertrophy but also of strength gains in training. That is why all of the strongest powerlifters, who are only interested in moving as much weight as possible, train in that way (medium/heavy weights).
Coach/powerlifter Greg Nuckols has written two books on the topic (The Art of Lifting and the Science of Lifting) which are sort of summarizing the literature on the subject, but you can find a lot of the content for free on his blog strengtheory (for example this post: <a href=""http://www.strengtheory.com/more-is-more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strengtheory.com/more-is-more/</a>)<p>Two other web pages offering meta analysis of the literature are <a href=""http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/strength/#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/strength/#3</a> (about strength) and <a href=""http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#...</a> (about hypertrophy)",1428692825

They should be reserved for stuff that needs to be private, or is urgent. Both doesn't apply to marketing blurps.<p>Why the hate - because DMs multiply the cost of following somebody by a lot. Whereas initially it is just one click ""oh heck, why not"", it ends up being a hassle of a LOT more clicks and wasted brain cycles.<p>Edit: why I said ""don't advise your clients to do that"" - my most likely reaction would be to unfollow that user, and I think many feel the same.

One thing I've never done though is to go into an interview with a prepared list of questions.<p>First I would try to get a feeling for the personality of the person applying for he job, to see if they would fit in, then I'd try to gage whether or not they had the required background for the job, and I might follow up with a question or two about that background.<p>A few people were caught fibbing and the interview was gracefully terminated. But for the most part, the people that showed up were honest and fairly candid about what they could and could not do. I've never felt the need to resort to 'trick' or 'puzzle' questions or questions that were meant to trip them up.<p>Psychological games with people that are already nervous tend to have weird outcomes, better to get them to be relaxed and to tell you what you need to know freely.<p>One guy even admitted to having stolen some office supplies from a previous employer (he had a hole in his resume).<p>The employer fired him on the spot but he was very capable, he'd learned his lesson and I ended up hiring him, he was quite amazed at being hired and was one of the best people we ever had working for us.

""Free"" can be a big draw.  A lot of people will go to get the ""free"" item.  However, to get this ""free"" item, they have travel to get it.  In the US this probably means burning some petroleum in their car, but when gasoline is cheap enough, most people in the US don't think too much about having to get in the car.  In times like that, being able to drive somewhere and pick something up without paying is effectively ""free.""  For most people, ""Free Software"" works somewhat like this.  It's ""free"" and they really don't think of what they pay for network access.<p>Micro-payments could work like this.  If user expectations could be aligned that way, ""free"" could mean only for the cost of the download.  (If you dig enough, for most people ""free"" just means: please don't make me pay more than $35 a month for doing everything I do on the Internet.)<p>In other words, it's all in our minds.  It's all just how we think of it.  Markets are a great way to regulate something ubiquitous.

856925,comment,856766,856837,0,0,icey,,,"Look, it's really not that tough. Here's what you need to treat vim as a text editor with syntax highlighting:<p><pre><code>  esc (escape) = go to the default mode
  i (insert) = when you want to make changes to the document
  
  esc + : (escape, colon) = think of this as control + whatever
  :w = (w)rite - save your file
  :q = (q)uit - quit vim
  :wq = (w)rite, then (q)uit
  :q! = (q)uit!, discarding any changes
</code></pre>
Just those few things will let you use vim well enough while you're figuring out all the really cool stuff it can do.<p>Emacs can be treated similiarly: 
  C = control
  M = ""meta"", usually the alt or option key. You can use escape if you want.<p><pre><code>  C-x C-f = control x (do something) + control f (find file) - open a file
  C-x C-s = save a file
  C-x C-c = quit
  C-k = (k)ill - this is similar to cut
  C-y = yank - this is similar to paste
</code></pre>
For emacs, it may be easier to start with cua mode -<p><pre><code>  M-x cua-mode

93451,comment,93157,93314,0,0,DaniFong,,,"This is a non-radiative method: in the absence of a receiving device with a correctly tuned inductance, in the field surrounding the emitter there will be no, or hardly any E x B field. In other words, there would be no, or hardly any energy leaving the emitter.<p>Most interestingly, the method they describe can be used in a unidirectional manner, and the power supplied would fall off much less quickly than 1/r^2. One could even put a switch on the receiving circuit. When the circuit is broken, the total energy expended by the emitter would zip down to zero passively, without any control required. In fact, it's a fairly straightforward game to construct one of these on one's own. Too bad I didn't think of it ;-)",1198928229

Working for sustained periods on a laptop is asking for back and neck pain, fatigue, and probably long-term damage to your body.<p>Also get a good chair, and a desk that is the right height, while you're at it.<p>My lappy is a small 12.1"", but I never use it for serious work--just email, and occasional ""watching a movie with the girlfriend, but still have some work to do"" time.  I just got an OLPC XO (7"" screen, I think) and plan to use it for my primary travel lappy...no temptation to work long hours on a lappy that small, and I consider that a good thing.",1198926863

To me the bigger the screen/resolution the better and Macbook Pro is certainly one of the lightest 15.4"" so I would recommend that. Personally I could not tell the weight difference between carrying a 13"" Macbook and 15"" Macbook pro.<p>However, 13.3"" and 1280x800 is my minimum requirement that mobility could not justify any smaller spec.",1198926787

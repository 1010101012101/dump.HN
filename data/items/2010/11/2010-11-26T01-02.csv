1941416,comment,1932295,1941222,0,0,lucasjung,,,"On the one hand, I appreciate the second two sentences of your post.  On the other hand, the first sentence wipes out any semblance of goodwill:<p>""You certainly show a level of maturity that is not common among typical hunters.""<p>This is just plain stereotyping.  I don't know how you formed your perception of the average maturity level of a typical hunter, but it clearly wasn't by actually interacting with typical hunters.  Furthermore, I'm not even sure what a ""typical"" hunter is.  That's kind of like a ""typical"" golfer, or a ""typical"" swimmer.  I move around a lot, but I don't like to hunt alone, which unfortunately means I don't get to hunt very much any more.  It also means that I'm always looking for new people to hunt with, and I've found hunters from all walks of life, often in very heterogeneous groups where the only thing they share in common is hunting.<p>If anything, hunting promotes maturity: when you teach a ten year old how to utilize a deadly weapon, and all of the ways you can accidentally hurt or kill yourself or others with it, and all of the rules for avoiding such mishaps, and all of the myriad ways you can get hurt or killed outdoors even without weapons involved, the sudden load of responsibilities tends to instill maturity in a way that less hazardous activities can't.  True, some kids simply aren't ready for it as young as others, but most parents/mentors see this quickly and wait another year before resuming the lessons.  Much like alcohol use in conjunction with firearms, it's rather self-enforcing: would you want to hang out in the middle of nowhere with an immature kid wielding a lethal weapon?  Neither would I.  Does it happen?  Sure.  Is it common?  No.",1290736053

1941410,comment,1941306,1941306,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""The Ruby community, at least in the US, has proven to be very open to change, see Rails 1, 2 and 3 for example. ""<p>That's change?<p>That's like saying you've moved from sliced cheese to cheese on white bread to grilled Swiss on toast, and claiming to be open to new tastes[0].<p>Were there a real appetite for change there would be far more enthusiasm for the dozen+ Ruby Web frameworks instead of the increasing Ruby is Rails is Ruby mantra.<p>(There's a selection bias in my observation; people open to change often don't self-identify as <language>-ists; they're busy using a variety of languages and libraries.  The ""Rubyists"" open to change are using Clojure, Haskell, Lua, and Go. :) )<p>Referencing Chad Fowler is sort of ironic, given that he had stood before a Ruby conf crowd and told people to <i>stop</i> working on Nitro; Rails had ""won"", so there was no need for a competing framework.<p>Why not declare that REXML ""won"" (it's in the std-lib after all), that we don't need competing libraries, and leave it at that? Because, as with Web frameworks, that would be stupid.<p>It's worth noting that REXML got added to the standard lib because of the belief that Ruby should ""do XML"" out of the box.  I have no idea if that's still a compelling argument, though enthusiasm for anything XML has, let's say, diminished.   Assuming the low friction of installing gems as needed, and advances in non-std lib gems, it's really hard to argue for keeping it in.  But REXML was a gem at the time of its inclusion, there was no great love for XML, and people still wanted to bundle it in.<p>None of this is new; the debate started as soon as rubygems was reasonably stable, and perked up again once rubygems was moved into Ruby proper.  The biggest arguments against splitting out the std lib were that some people work under constrictive code installment policies (so just grabbing gems as needed can be an issue), and that there is an advantage to vetting broadly useful libraries to ensure they play nice with the rest of the core code (i.e., you don't end up with a DB lib that modifies Object or Class with surprising results).<p>[0] It also reminds me of a line from ""The Blues Brothers"", ""Oh, we got both kinds [of music] -- country <i>and</i> western""",1290735794

1941392,comment,1941306,1941306,0,0,cscotta,,,"Mike's a great guy, and I appreciate his post but would respectfully disagree with the proposal to strip the standard library down to barebones and break out the removed classes into gems (along with the post's title to which I object, but will not take issue).<p>Despite its lack of use in web projects, DRb is one of Ruby's most interesting modules. Geoffrey Grosenbach's recounting of _why's 2005 FOSCON presentation is among the highlights - see here for an example: <a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-post-modern-genius/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-p...</a><p>The English RDoc is eminently fixable as well, whether by a core contributor or not. In fact, the first commenter on the post highlights a quick guide to contributing to the language.<p>More importantly, the process for formalizing the Ruby language into an international specification is progressing nicely, first with Japan's ISC committee, and later with ISO. While the draft specification is restricted to the language itself and does not include several components of what we know as the standard library, it would be prudent for the language itself to continue to stabilize. You can find the 12/2009 draft spec here: <a href=""http://ruby-std.netlab.jp/draft_spec/draft_ruby_spec-20091201.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby-std.netlab.jp/draft_spec/draft_ruby_spec-2009120...</a><p>Finally, many groups of developers have made tremendous progress on non-MRI/YARV implementations, such as JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby, and MagLev, with others such as SAP's BlueRuby continuing to show promise (passing over 75% of RubySpec as of last year). Sweeping changes to the language and standard library impedes the maturation of these implementations, placing additional burden upon their developers and sponsors who are already doing tremendous work to advance the state of the language across multiple platforms.<p>We would also do well to remember that the community of English-speaking web developers using Ruby represents a small subset of the Ruby community as a whole. Though some of us might not find daily use for all of the modules in the standard library, it needn't be assumed that they should be removed and/or broken out.<p>Many languages experience similar growing pains. The Python standard library contains a few modules which seem out of place to most web developers, the JDK is a bit of a grabbag, and the .NET class library has a handful of oddities. Nonetheless, it's important to remember that many people use these components and they work quite well. What some may decry as cruft and stagnation, others might regard as a sign of stability and maturity.<p>What I appreciate most though is the civility of this discussion. Between Mike's first post, Eric's reply, and this follow-up, the conversation's professionalism and camaraderie is impressive. It's great to see programmers coming together to discuss improvements to the language and its direction in a calm, refreshing environment. I haven't written much Ruby in the past year, so it wouldn't be appropriate of me to offer an extended post as a reply, but I'm glad to see the discussion happening.",1290734973

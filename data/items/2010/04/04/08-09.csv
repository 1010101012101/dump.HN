1239959,comment,1238794,1239320,0,0,sketerpot,,,"I wonder how much of this is just because you're using a slow encryption function. On my (quite fast) machine, the default 128-bit AES encryption can handle a little under 800 Mbit/s. Meanwhile, Threefish-512 can encrypt at 4 Gbit/s on the same machine, with what we lightheartedly hope is an equal or greater amount of security. And if you use CTR mode for block chaining, you can parallelize it among however many cores you have, for several times speedup -- my quad-core machine could manage 16 Gbit/s with Threefish-512 in CTR mode, which is really quite zippy.<p>What I'm saying is, faster transfers <i>should</i> be possible. And they probably already are, if you're willing to find out how to tweak the OpenSSH settings. Maybe.",1270371252

I don't think it'll turn out that way--- quite obviously. i think market forces, meaning people making money off the apps can be enticing.<p>i don't think this will be limited to iPads--- Google Android apps could be another vector, but you make a good argument re: that it would be like another browser to support.  imho they'll support it too as soon as more and more people use mobile to browse the internet. iPads, iPhones, Android phones, are awesome platforms to make this happen.",1270370567

1239952,comment,1237939,1237939,0,0,samratjp,,,"If you like milk - make chai (indian tea)<p>Also, to get in some veggies with some taste, try some curries (you can learn to make a decent potato curry and save leftovers - you can get some ready to make mixes at your local asian grocery store). Also, cauliflower curry is pretty good tasting yet economical and lots of leftover. With curries, indian flat bread (naan) is pretty good.<p>As about Ramen, you can make that better by getting better flavored ones (again, hit the asian groceries). A crazy cool trick - make ramen stove top; but first, fry some onions and w/e veggies then set it aside. Do your ramen with water thing, then throw in the veggies and your local asian grocery curry mix.<p>As about eggs - a bagel and omelette in the middle is a pretty decent breakfast. Throw in some fried onions and some basil flavored pasta sauce (try the pasta sauce section) in the omelette and you have a winner.",1270370335

1239950,story,,,4,9,nekopa,"Ask HN: Hacking Learning Resources?",,"I have put myself on a heavy learning workload, as I feel I need to update most of my skills. As a teacher, I have set myself challenging, project based goals for this learning. Through some old HN submissions I have found some excellent resources on the various subjects (Math, AI, statistics, design, programming to name a few)\nThe only thing that I can't seem to find are any resources about improving (or hacking) the process of learning (various google searches have led to articles on learning how to hack, but not hacking how to learn). I managed to uncover this site: http://oedb.org/library/college-basics/hacking-knowledge which has some good tips, but I would like to see if anyone here has some good book recommendations. \nOne thing to keep in mind is that I don't want to <i>cheat</i> so to say, I am not going for any exams or anything like that, and I am not looking for short cuts (I do have a few books on the memory palace theory and such for helping my recall). I am just trying to find some good ways to make my methods of learning more efficient, as I have a lot of information to go through.",1270369839

I suspect that with the ipad, its more of the beginnings of a new facet of computing.<p>For me, as a developer, the ipad certainly won't be much more than a diversion or a target for development.  For people like my wife, though, I think it will definitely have an impact.  Many people simply want a content consumption device (web, media, etc), and I think the ipad is a very good device for consuming most content.",1270369784

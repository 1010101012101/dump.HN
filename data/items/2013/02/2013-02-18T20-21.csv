Just asking journalists to be a little less careless and fuzzy would be a good start.

But the original review is up as is. It's not amended, not corrected in any way.<p>2. Elon Musk said his faith in the NYTimes is restored over twitter. This to me looks like Elon made a deliberate decision to pick a fight with a single contributor and not with the entire newspaper. Besides, Elon knows other people will continue fighting on his behalf, so he can now take the high road and back off. Good tactics here.<p>3. The spin by the NYT editor is really clever. By quoting another person who mostly sides with Tesla and agreeing with that person she comes across as responding to the conflict with substance. But because the words aren't her own she can keep her status as a mostly impartial arbiter. And because she didn't say which parts of the quoted response she agreed with she can deny any part of it if needed! What she did here is equivalent to composing a list of 7 statements and adding to the bottom ""I agree with 4 out of the 7 statements above"". Sneaky sneaky.<p>4. Her final conclusion is that ""people will go on contesting these points"" but ultimately ""few conclusions are unassailable"". That's pretty much a classic ""it's all relative"" sort of response.

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteaus famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize that only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteaus, who is, in this critics opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteaus soon, hungry for more.</i>""",1361219066

When IBM launched its first PC, it also chose EasyWriter, over competition from other programmers, including a young Bill Gates.""<p>I have the real story, and the author should have talked to me. After my program Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>) replaced Easy Writer and became Apple's default word processor, someone from IBM called me up and asked me to write a word processor for their PC.<p>I asked ""What business terms?""

Here, Eric Felten of the WSJ gives an appropriately glowing review to Evan Wiliams based juleps. Evan Williams is 43% ABV. (Maker's is 45%.) <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120916374801546109.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120916374801546109.html</a> Yes you make it with lots of crushed ice and some branch water but that doesn't mean you need ""~100 proof liquor,"" which is 50% ABV seen in contemporary ""barrel strength"" bottlings but not in any bottled whiskey available historically when the julep became popular. In other words, the julep is meant to be a little ""watery,"" and in fact has enough water to open up the bourbon so you can more fully taste it. You might prefer it with a strong whisky but that's really an orthogonal issue as the julep became popular when made with standard strength bourbon (and anyone who wants a meaningfully potent bourbon will upgrade to barrel or cask strength anyway).<p>2. Other than the julep and perhaps the ""whiskey highball"" (not drunk nearly as much today as 50 years ago) you should not find many ""bourbon drinks"" with lots of ice.<p>The most popular cocktails today made with bourbon are the Manhattan and the Old Fashioned (both arguably better with rye, but whatever). The Manhattan is traditionally served ""up"" (no ice); the old fashioned is properly served with either one very large cube or a few medium large cubes. Anyone serving with smaller ice (bad idea) is not going to go to the trouble of serving a 50%+ (""~100 proof"") ABV barrel- or cask- strength bourbon. And anyway over proper ice a 40% ABV bourbon is just fine, thank you, in an old fashioned.<p>Another popular bourbon drink would be the whiskey sour, served either iceless or like an old fashioned (ice wise).<p>3. In no way are whiskey cocktails particularly likely to be icey or watery vs cocktails made from other spirits. Gin has the Tom Collins, Gin Rickey, and Gin & Tonic, all watery enough to compete well against the julep and whiskey highball. Rum has the mojito, for which the same holds true; vodka the Moscow Mule and screwdriver.<p>Anyway, I agree that this was a dumb move on the part of Maker's Mark, but not because it involves any actual functional issue in terms of mixing drinks. It's dumb because the brand stood for a particular flavor profile, and people paid extra to get that flavor profile, and you don't go changing it out from under them. Life is complicated enough without liquor brands getting all dynamic on us.",1361218248

Customer interaction was fairly limited, relationship building was minimal, meetings of any sort were kept on strict time schedules (and no longer than 1 hour).<p>This ran counter to how the rest of us moved software. He did ""ok"" compared to the rest of us in short term sales, but not a single one of his customers stayed on as long term customers.<p>Enter a new CEO, he brought in a professional sales team, and restructured the sales operation to a base + commission model. Very quickly one problem became very apparent. The hours worked on a sale by the a sales guy were quickly dwarfed by the hours worked by the rest of the staff to support him. But when the sale was made, he kept the entire commission.<p>This became a really big problem as the new sales guys would start new custom demo building efforts without regard to how much time it took the rest of the staff to support him. To him, his 2 or 3 1-hour meetings, a half dozen emails and a phone call or two didn't change if the demo took 8 hours to put together or 120.<p>Sales were also still not up-to-par. The sales team blamed the lack of support, the support team resented the flippant treatment by sales. Something had to give.<p>The new CEO was absolutely opposed to getting rid of commission entirely, he felt that it would limit his ability to recruit new sales talent. So I proposed a middle ground:<p>- any designated sales person ""owned"" their account and were guaranteed some money out of a deal closing<p>- if he made the sale completely, 100% on his own, he kept 100% of the commission. This was to encourage them to start respecting how much work went into the support he received and for them to better learn the product line they were pushing (we had a problem where every salesman needed a support engineer in every sales meeting to answer 80% of the questions the customer posed)<p>- if he required even 5 minutes of anybody else's time, he lost 40% of this commission, to be paid to the person who helped him. This was to encourage the sales staff to collaborate and get the most out of their support person, and to encourage the support person to collaborate with the sales guy -- effectively reintroducing the ""everybody is a salesperson"" back into the company<p>- if more than one person had to help, the 40% was split between those people, this again further encouraged collaboration, skill building (so the support person wouldn't have to rope in additional colleagues) and the need for the requesting sales person to actually learn about the functions needed to support his sales effort and who had those skills<p>In the end, the sales guy, rather than being a brash, drive by, finger pointing irritant to the company -- rewarded for everybody else's work -- had to learn to lead micro-teams for each sales effort, or learn the products back and forth and serve themselves.<p>The results:<p>- small sales efforts ended up being handled solo, the sales guys started to get really good at estimating LoE for a sale. One guy ended up specializing in these and handed off larger sales to the rest of the sales team as he didn't want to coordinate people...he kept selling so it was fine<p>- larger LoEs automatically pulled in a few core people who ended up more or less as sales engineers for the sales staff, we became much more careful about sizing sales vs. LoE so we didn't waste now 2 or 3 people's time<p>- support staff loved getting extra checks every quarter, motivation was up and resentment was down<p>- sales guys became much more part of the team than slick lone-wolfs<p>sales were up record percentages<p>What went wrong?<p>When more than one support staff worked on a sale, it became unclear how to split the 40% at times.<p>There were still sales where the support work dwarfed the sales guy's work, and/or times when the sales guys thought they could game the system by delegating virtually all of the sales process to a support person, then collect their 60% for virtually no work (this happened under the old system when they made 100% too) the 60/40 split didn't always make everybody happy.<p>It introduced quite a bit of complexity into the sales process. Pre-commission, we were free to just focus on the sales process, post-commission there was endless negotiations over commission splits, payout times, etc.<p>If I <i>had</i> to do it over again, I make the rules this way.<p>Sales people would be payed a normal competitive salary, no commissions until they've at least covered their own cost to the company, then commission pay outs as before.<p>Actually, I'd still setup a commission-free system, but with generous bonuses to outstanding members of the team.",1361218180

Otherwise, <i>the user thinks</i> that if they forget to pay, their backups are suddenly and instantly lost.",1240048613

If you can get more money from some people by giving them a bit more, that means more investment in your service and code, which is good for everyone, no?",1240048446

(Reference counting breaks if you have circular references; this is a problem for garbage collection, but not for tarsnap.)",1240048103

Theoretically select-all-unread-archive is easier than interrupting focus, archive, resuming focus, but the mental burden of 200+ unread messages is not to be underestimated.",1240046585
568216,comment,568079,568211,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>It would be nice to have a demo service</i><p>That might happen in the future -- the current architecture of the tarsnap server makes this difficult (I don't have ""total storage used by user X"" updated in realtime).<p><i>If your account stays below zero, your backups will be deleted</i><p>Right now what I do is send out an email when an account balance falls below 7 days worth of storage, another email when an account falls below zero, and then I wait a week after that before deleting anything.  These timelines might change in the future, which is why I haven't specified anything precise on the website.<p><i>...multinational corporation...</i><p>You're quite right -- but I didn't start this because I wanted to make life easy for multinational corporations.  I started this because <i>I</i> wanted a good backup system, and it seemed to me that while multinational corporations had lots of good options available, there weren't really any good options for people like me.",1240046561

568211,comment,568079,568079,0,0,10ren,,,"This is partly the micropayment problem. The other way around it is to extend credit, and bill people. I can see this is against your profitability rule. Just saying it's another solution, in general.<p>You didn't ask for feedback, so feel free to ignore the following :-)<p>It would be nice to have a demo service, to play with before paying the $5. You could limit it to a trivial amount of storage (like 100 bytes) - the purpose is not to store stuff, but to have a play. An easier on-ramp helps adoption, gives people a chance to kick the tyres.<p><i>If your account stays below zero, your backups will be deleted.</i> This is a bit scary for a backup service. I'm sure you haven't actually deleted anything, but it would be reassuring if you gave a schedule, e.g. emails every day for a month (perhaps mimic the warnings of a domain name registrar). The main thing is to reassure people, by communicating what you will do before deleting their stuff.<p>One warning about ""a service that you would use"". A multinational corporation has different values from an individual, and they will happily pay more than you can imagine, if you can solve their problems.  I guess this doesn't apply to you, because bigger customers would setup their own backup, instead of using your service (as you say). I'm just saying that your own sense of value doesn't always translate to different needs - unless you can imagine yourself as a multinational corp, I guess. :-)",1240045281

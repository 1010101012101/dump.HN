The tilt it&#x27;s a bit annoying and it is not useful.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think that the red colo(u)r fits for a baby/child page. I would change it to a more appealing light blue combination.<p>3. Color scheme again, I believe the red on the footer is different than the red on the header. Choose one...<p>4. A bit more about the bee, you have a bee holding some portraits with a 15 yo child, maybe you can look for a better mascot that suits all ages or focus into a narrower age range.<p>5. What is joognu and what is weaver? Why the &quot;w&quot; logo is in a different typography than the &quot;hand made&quot; text?<p>6. After the login. The colo(u)rs are really horrible, red, purple, pink, blue, green... It&#x27;s ok to have different colors for different products but I think you should change the way you present them, this way is very intrusive with the main theme.<p>7. It&#x27;s really hard to guess what is going on into the user page. I have clicked &quot;weaver&quot; and I don&#x27;t know what to do... I just want to add memories so, what the heck does &quot;time to gift&quot; mean? I just want to share a photo of my boy playing baseball...<p>8.

From Wikipedia: &quot;The superposition principle states that the net response at a given place and time caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses which would have been caused by each stimulus individually&quot;. 
The electromagnetic field in vacuum is linear, because it obeys Maxwell&#x27;s equations and it is a solution of a set of linear equations. The output is always proportional to the input: you put a bigger charge and you get a bigger field. A linear combination of electromagnetic fields, with constant, real coefficients, is a new field which obeys Maxwell&#x27;s equations, thus it is still linear and the superposition principle is still valid.",1380811322

Imagine if the shop owners refused to cooperate? It would have been much harder to solve this crime.<p>There are some guidelines that I think can help. If you get stopped for a traffic stop and the cop says he wants to take a quick look through your car, you should (respectfully) decline. That can lead to nothing good for you. If you think you might be suspected of a crime (right or wrong), or you don&#x27;t know why the police want to talk to you, do not go and meet with them. If you get arrested, get a lawyer and let him/her deal with talking to the police. You can talk to the judge if it comes to that.<p>If they explain that they are investigating a crime and you have some information or evidence they need, go ahead and help them if you are not a target.<p>Just remember, the police are not your friend. They do not care about your life. They will lie to you and manipulate you if it suits their purpose. However, they do in fact serve an important function, that you may need them someday.

Also, IANAL, so I may be interpreting some of this incorrectly.<p>On the PDF&#x27;s page 51, there begins a record of a court proceeding, deliberating what, exactly, the government is looking for in these proceedings. They discuss the coverage that the FBI thinks its pen register needs. Of note is that Levison was not opposed to the pen register (which, to my understanding, would provide the FBI with all encrypted traffic going through Lavabit&#x27;s servers), he was opposed only to providing the encryption keys, which Levison asserts would provide the FBI the ability to decrypt all traffic, and not just the traffic of the aforementioned SUBJECT, (read: probably Snowden).<p>The judge appears to not be a rubber-stamp entity, which is nice, as shown on pages 58-59.<p>Page 60, Levison states that all the gov needed to do to install the pen register, was set up an appointment with him. But, again, he would not provide any keys.<p>Ha. On page 61, the court explicitly says that all requests for oversight and monitoring will be denied:<p><pre><code>    MR. LEVISON : I guess while I&#x27;m here in regards to the pen register,
        would it be possible to request some sort of external audit to
        ensure that your orders are followed to the letter in terms of
        the information collected and preserved?
    THE COURT : No. The law provides for those things, and any other
        additional or extra monitoring you might want or think is
        appropriate will be denied, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27; re requesting.
</code></pre>
On page 100, Levison states that he can manage to get the information the FBI is looking for, without providing the FBI with Lavabit&#x27;s encryption keys. Someone (AUSA[censored]) says that the proposed solution does not satisfy the subpoenas and court orders, because it would not provide real-time access to the data.<p>On page 107-108, the court has this to say about a loss of trust from Lavabit&#x27;s customers, in the event that Lavabit hands over its SSL keys: &quot;Any resulting loss of customer &quot;trust&quot; is not an &quot;unreasonable&quot; burden&quot;<p>Starting on page 121, there is a court discussion about &quot;a motion to quash the requirement of Lavabit to produce its encryption keys and the motion to unseal and lift the nondisclosure requirements of Mr. Levison.&quot;<p>Page 126, the court on the government&#x27;s &quot;right to information&quot;. Within the bounds of a criminal investigation, this position seems correct, but they are still requesting a key that would decrypt the communications of about 400,000 customers. Within that context, it seems like overreach.<p><pre><code>    THE COURT : I can understand why the system was set up, 
        but I think the government is -- government&#x27;s clearly entitled 
        to the information that they&#x27;re seeking, and just because 
        you-all have set up a system that makes that difficult, that 
        doesn&#x27;t in any way lessen the government&#x27;s right to receive that 
        information just as they would from any telephone company or any 
        other e-mail source that could provide it easily. Whether 
        it&#x27;s -- in other words, the difficulty or the ease in obtaining 
        the information doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with whether or not 
        the government&#x27;s lawfully entitled to the information.
</code></pre>
Man, read page 128 and 129. The judge basically says that because it&#x27;s a criminal case, the 4th Amendment doesn&#x27;t apply to the data they are requesting (Lavabit&#x27;s SSL key, which is very emphatically NOT Snowden&#x27;s data (or, sorry, THE SUBJECT&#x27;s data)).<p>What appears to be the now infamous 11 page of 4-point key starts at page 145, as Attachment A.

Some see it as a job, some get a power trip, and others take pride in their work.<p>I&#x27;ve posted this before on HN, but will quickly cover it again; A few years ago, my wife was at school and (completely her own fault) left her purse in the class during lunch (this is a medical career school and the class had about 8 students). That night we received a call from Chase asking about a string of purchase attempts using one of her cards - which she then realized was missing. Based on the list of places the card was used, we went to the stores the following day explaining what happened. Once we had done  the leg work, confirmed that they would have video surveillance during the time the card was used, we called the police. The officers that showed up went to great lengths to file the report, work with GameStop, Target and Stop&Shop security personnel to not only get us to identify the person, but get video evidence of the crimes at each location. In the end, the classmate who stole the card was prosecuted and served jail time in two separate counties as well as payment of damages (small, but still) for the attempted use of the card which got her nothing in the end. Coincidently, the detective on the case also saw that the girls mom had a warrant out for her arrest so they picked her up as well.<p>The experience was very positive from our side of things - and perhaps it&#x27;s not the common experience people hear about, but these officers were very happy to help. As a side note, the county that these officers were in was not a small, nor &quot;safe&quot; county and it wasn&#x27;t a matter of them not having anything else to do at the time.<p>All that being said, the original advice of not talking, and knowing your rights should definitely be adhered to if you are on the other side of things. The way everything was used to aide us, can also be used against you. Not all police will treat you the same.",1380809799

You can split hairs and say that these are APIs and not real DSLs, but I think the point about dynamic languages blurring the lines is totally fair.

You need a minimal level phone for things like Siri and other features they never bothered backporting or couldn&#x27;t due to hardware limitations.<p>Google OS updates are almost academic at this point. Google deploys a play store service which is a root-level middle man between your phone and various google services and apps. Google updates this themselves. Google apps are not tied to the OS, like Apple&#x27;s apps are. Someone with a phone on 4.1 can get the same version of Maps that I do on 4.3. Heck, you can be on gingerbread and use all the same apps practically. Google has a huge incentive to keep gingerbread level OS phones up to date with its latest apps because so many are still  in circulation.<p>Lastly, custom firmwares like CyoagenMod deliver up to date versions of android for many phones. So, no, its not so cut and dry.  Also, if you really want an iphone, then go buy one.  You&#x27;ll get an easier update process but have to deal with all its limitations.<p>Its also worth mentioning that the galaxy nexus is a phone from 2011 that just got the newest version of android and is still a pretty beefy phone. No idea if its getting the next version officially, but it will be trivial to put a 3rd party firmware on there if not. Android has always had a phone that&#x27;s updated for 2 years: the Nexus line.  The only exception is the custom Nexus non-GSM nexus Sprint/Verizon sold for a short time.

At least that&#x27;s how it plays out in the media.<p>With the [attempted] assassination of an individual you can&#x27;t have a sting because the main conspirator targets a specific individual [but you can have a sting on a conspiracy charge, so I see how it applies]. It&#x27;s not like they find their target&#x27;s not there and decide to just kill a random person. They are only ever concerned with killing a specific person. Now if that specific person doesn&#x27;t exist then there can&#x27;t be a killing.<p>With the bomb plot, drug deal, prostitution, child abuser the targets are generalised. The particular nature of the stooge isn&#x27;t important to the potential perpetrator.<p>If I tell you there&#x27;s a bank in my town, then we plan a heist, then it turns out that there&#x27;s no bank.

This because they sort on name-version basis.<p>Heck, even with major versions the separation is usually a hack by putting the major version number into the name part of the package id (name1-version, name2-version, etc).<p>Thus you get conflicts when you want to install name-version and name-version+1 at the same time.<p>This is not a Linux problem though, as on the OS level the libs are separated using the soname system.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname</a>",1445522387

Two things shocked him about his new home: the diversity of the people on the streets and the fantastic range of foods in the grocery stores. He took photographs of the rows and rows of sausages in Manhattan and mailed them to his mother in Moscow. &quot;I&#x27;d never seen so many sausages,&quot; he says.

But the physics involved would be entirely unknown, because mathematical points have precisely zero extent, with the side effect being that two mathematical points either a) occupy the same location, making them physically indistinguishable, or b) occupy different locations, making them absolutely disjoint (ie, &quot;infinitely apart&quot;).<p>Let&#x27;s think about 2 points approaching each other in a classical Newtonian universe. Now they are a meter apart and now they are a millimeter apart and now they are a nanometer apart. In each of these cases, they are perfectly disjoint, and have no possible way of communicating to each other. But now they both occupy the same location, and all possible classical physical descriptions have broken down!<p>The only rational solution is that the universe can only have a fundamentally nonlocal description. That is, the fundamental units of reality are spatially extended fields that do not suffer from the same requirement of pure mutual exclusivity that naive Bohr-esque classical models suffer from.<p>Abandoning this requirement is what gave de Broglie the impetus to develop his own theoretical model that would soon thereafter inspire Schrodinger to develop a mathematical infrastructure, which, when combined with Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics via Dirac&#x27;s new algebraic formalism, would become the modern, canonical quantum theory that we have today.<p>Edit: downvotes land me in negative territory for this :( ...

Power Pivot runs a private, anonymous instance of SSAS Tabular behind the Excel process, with a few features disabled (e.g. row-level security).<p>Power View is a high level visualization and dashboarding tool introduced for SharePoint 2010 and 2013 as a part of the SQL Server 2012 SSRS module.[1] This is the visualization tool designed to pair with Power Pivot and the Tabular model.

In light of that consideration, I&#x27;m left with a belief that the most likely cause of comments like these is simple misunderstanding of rhetorical technique in writing.  This is not a character flaw - it could be a touch of autism, or simply that the context switch from the very literal and meticulous mode of interpretation required when looking at code all day was not fully context-switched out when reading journalistic prose.  In any case, and for what it&#x27;s worth, here are a few of what I found to be sensible interpretations of the points that caused distress for the above commenter:<p>Jam.  I didn&#x27;t read it as saying that the existence of jam positively and empirically correlates to a better shopping experience - the jam was used merely as an example - sample data, if you will - for demonstrating the central point that a proliferation of choice counter-intuitively causes less actual purchasing to be <i>done</i> than does an offering of fewer jams.<p>Jeans.  The commenter quite correctly perceives that this is related to the jam.  But the choice of product is, again, used to demonstrate that a rise in options has a point of diminishing returns beyond which customer participation decreases.  I didn&#x27;t interpret the article to hold the position that this was <i>better</i>, in any absolute sense, but that the negative experiences the writer describes were his attempt to make sense of, again, the phenomenon where too many choices makes people buy less.<p>This may be a phenomenon that, while it exists, not everyone experiences - that does not mean that the article is an attack on those people.  And I think even people who enjoy as much choice as possible can still find the effect this article describes to be interesting, if only for how it seems inconsistent with what a purely theoretical approach would lead one to expect.<p>I didn&#x27;t perceive that the author ever put forth the notion that less choice was better - if that assertion exists, it arises from one possible interpretation of the effect he describes.<p>These are my readings of the original article, and I share them with you as a perhaps useful guide for escaping the feeling the above comment seems to have, that there is inevitably a single and rather unpleasant attitude the author of the article could have had when creating this piece.",1445520694

Is it alredy dead OR alive (classical interpretation) or is it both at the same time (quantum mechanics) before you open the box and look?<p>The classical interpretation needs so-called hidden variables which determine the state of the cat.<p>In the quantum mechanics interpretation the state is determined when the interaction (measurement, looking at it) takes place. Before that there are several parallel realities of what could be.<p>In the case of the cat we cannot actually determine which interpretation is correct. We need a different kind of experiment:<p>As far as I understood (no physicist here) they use two entangled objects. E.g. two photons which are generated by a special process so that one polarized one way and the other one polarized the other way but we don&#x27;t know which is which before the measurement.<p>Then you need to measure both photons separately and determine (statistically) which has which polarization.<p>These measurements need to be spaced out far enough such that faster than light speed communication would be required for the photon measured first to tell the second photon what was happening.<p>So far it still doesn&#x27;t help to exclude the possibility of hidden variables since the measurement setup is static.<p>Another trick is needed.<p>They use a random generator to determine at both ends what to measure (which polarization direction) shortly before doing the actual measurement. So, when the photon is generated it doesn&#x27;t know what would be acutally measured.<p>When you tabularize the all the possible combinations of how the photons could be measured and calculate the possible probability for the measurement results, there is a difference between what we would expect from classical physics when the status is determined at photon generation and stored inside the photons in a hidden variable and the result we would get from quantum mechanics without a hidden variable but with (faster than light) spooky entanglements.<p>The experiments show that there is no hidden variable. This is a BIG thing because this means that classical physics are not enough to explain the universe.",1445520429

Arsenal sat deep specifically to shut down what muller and lewandowski could do, but I wouldn&#x27;t call that exploiting. In fact Arsenal didn&#x27;t really &#x27;exploit&#x27; or target any aspect of Bayern&#x27;s game (it&#x27;s hard to find flaws against &quot;top top class&quot; teams anyway), they were just really well disciplined and played some really good high tempo counter attacks. The lay-low and counter attack was just a good gameplan, not really an &#x27;exploit&#x27;.<p>But Bayern still mostly dominated and played really well. Arsenal&#x27;s goal was mainly due a horror error by Neuer, he really should have caught or punched that. (Yes it&#x27;s a set piece so anything can happen, but other than Walcott&#x27;s header, Sanchez&#x27;s chance and Giroud&#x27;s late header from a corner, I don&#x27;t really remember many more threatening set pieces, so Neuer should have really dealt with that, especially after the Walcott save.)<p>The only &#x27;flaws&#x27; that Bayern had were that they didn&#x27;t finish. Costa should have scored. Lewandowski should have scored maybe twice even though it was a quiet game for him by his standards. (Sanchez&#x27;s mistake was what lead to Costa&#x27;s chance on goal too.)<p>That last goal by Ozil was really just more of a case of Bellerin being a freak surprisingly right at the end of the match rather than Arsenal specifically exploiting anything. Arsenal was not high pressing (as a team) on that play, it was just a mistake (slow pass) combined with the incredible anticipation and speed from Bellerin (not to mention the desire to bolt into the box rather than jog to the corner flag).<p>In fact, you could clearly see throughout most of the match that <i>Bayern</i> was the one that kept wanting to target <i>Nacho</i>. Which was pretty weird because if they did their homework, they should have known how massively impressive Nacho has been recently.<p>> This has been slowly changing the past few seasons however.<p>And despite all of what I just said, I <i>am</i> acknowledging that Arsene isn&#x27;t as &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; as he was maybe 5 years ago. Because that comment was more of an observation in general of the post-Highbury era, not literally the past few days when it&#x27;s obvious that there&#x27;s more to Arsene&#x27;s game nowadays.<p>If you wanted to use a recent example anyway, the game against United would have been a much better example imo (league games is generally when you should be &#x27;exploting&#x27; anyway, not in the cl, because you should be expecting <i>anything</i> in cl games, just because of the occasion). You could clearly see that Arsenal <i>specifically</i> targetted United&#x27;s slow midfield by high pressing on them (Walcott&#x27;s and Ozil&#x27;s workrate was impressive). And they were basically one-twoing their way past Bastian &quot;cannot run no more&quot; Schweinsteiger the whole match.",1445520163

Apple was trying to compete with the entire range of PC manufacturers, so in addition to licensed third-party Mac clones, they were making multiple ranges of desktop Mac with overlapping specs, on the principle that they could occupy one shelf slot per machine in Fry&#x27;s or Target with each model. So you had the Centris, the Performa, and the Quadra ranges, with high, middle, and low end machines in each range, educational and professional media authoring variants, and the powerbook range ...<p>Jobs returned and priority #1 was to staunch the cash haemorrhage. Rationalizing the product range and supply chain was a huge part of this. So he drew a simple diagram. X-axis: consumer and professional. Y-axis: desktop and portable. Four models would occupy the entire grid, with roughly three specification levels in each (think Goldilocks and the Three Bears). This gave us the iBook and iMac machines (consumer), and the Powerbook and Mac Pro machines (professional), with differentiation based on CPU speed/memory/disk capacity within each cell.<p>This made the choice of which machine to buy <i>vastly</i> easier on the customer; it was glaringly obvious which model you wanted, all you had to do was decide how much  speed/memory/disk capacity you needed, and that was it, rather than trying to figure out what the difference was between a Centris 630 and a Quadra 630AV (hint: RGB video out, 10MHz, and about $250) and so on ...<p>This turned the precipitous decline in Mac sales around. It took years to build up to the current powerhouse, but it staunched the arterial bleeding -- and all by giving the customers <i>less</i> choice, not more.",1445518965

10431907,comment,10430862,10431635,0,0,david-given,,,"It&#x27;s got a lot of historic warts. e.g. the OO system is a retrofit with invisible syntax: functions defined immediately after the type representing the object are methods, but you can&#x27;t interleave them with other statements. It desperately needs an explicit `class...end` structure. The OO model is kinda weird, too, although once you&#x27;ve beaten your head against it it makes sense. Another wart is that you can <i>only</i> define an expression function in a module specification and not in a module body. Huh? Likewise, you can only define pre- or post-conditions on public data, so you can&#x27;t have a module assert on its private state; you must export the state first.<p>String processing is both really nice and a pain. Built-in strings are fixed size, but the `array<>` magic means you do string processing using functional style without needing to explicitly size anything. The string libraries are a bit of a mess, with `Wide_String` and `Wide_Wide_String`, because they made the same mistake as Java and Windows about UCS-2 vs Unicode.<p>The standard library is <i>mostly</i> really cool, but it makes the same mistake C++ does in that entries in collections are always initialised by copying, so you can&#x27;t have collections of non-copyable objects. I forget the details but I think the last time I tried to do collections of pointers I couldn&#x27;t make it work properly.<p>Ada&#x27;s generics are awesome. Nested functions that work properly are awesome. The compilation time is awesome. Access semantics that prevent you leaking pointers to inner stack frames are awesome. in-out parameters are awesome (they mostly replace pointers). Being unable to pass a nested function to a procedure as a callback parameter is less awesome; the access semantics forbid it.<p>To my mind, though, the biggest showstopper in Ada is a technically fairly trivial thing: it&#x27;s case insensitive. This means that any programmer used to case sensitive languages, which is basically <i>any programmer</i>, will have to drastically revamp their coding style to work with Ada, because none of the usual conventions about separating locals from globals by capitalisation work any more. It also makes Ada code look ugly to the untrained eye. It&#x27;s hard to convert people when the first thing they say when looking at code is &#x27;ugh&#x27;.",1445518835

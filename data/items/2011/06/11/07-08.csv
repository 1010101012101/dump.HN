There's another thread on the front page of HN where people are describing how their Apple laptop power adapters burst into flames.<p>I am typing this on an iPad that periodically loses its wifi connection. Googling the problem yields dozens of complaints about this issue. Apple supporters on these forums blame wifi routers, even though the iPad is the only device with these issues.<p>I like the App Store, but, by default, I can't buy games on my iPad - why? Because I live in South Africa, and unlike every other device manufacturer with an app store here Apple hasn't applied for self rating games, which, according to most sources, is a straightforward process. Again, Apple and its supporters don't bother mentioning this little detail.<p>Apple does put a lot of care into their devices, but I also think there is a tendency to deny issues, to brush them over and to rely on the cult to impart an aura of invincibility.",1307779153

It's fairly clever. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.5548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.5548</a><p>If I recall correctly, here it is in short:\n1) Invent a new virtual machine ISA.\n2) Write a trusted compiler that targets that ISA. It is totally OK if this compiler is crap as long as it is correct.\n3) Build the original compiler with the new compiler. The result is a cross compiler, running on your new VM-ISA and targeting your host architecture (e.g., x86).\n4) Build the original compiler again with the output of step 3. The result is an x86-hosted compiler targeting x86.\nThe abstract seems to imply the last step:\n5) Diff the output of step 4 with the untrusted compiler.<p>The author, David A.

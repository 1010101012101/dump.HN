The latter part wasn't exactly helpful, to be honest. I'd been through numerous government training and employment schemes but coupled with my depression and my lacking recent employment history, not many people were willing to take me on.<p>I had spent a lot of this time approaching local design agencies and web dev studios (of which there are a lot in my area) for internships and the like, rarely ever met with a response, let alone a ""thank you, but no,"" so I kept plodding away.<p>Eventually, someone responded to my enquiry, a small design agency with a few fairly big clients, they offered me an unpaid internship working 3 or so days a week to build up some experience. As much as I came to learn they were exploiting me (I was there well over a year, eventually working for minimum wage), I still do owe them a hell of a lot. Getting back into the swing of things, doing something that I loved gave me my confidence back, I learned to trust my skills and that I am good at what I do.<p>From that point on, literally every changed in my life. I came off the anti-depressants, found a new girlfriend, got a new house and now have a new job making decent money for a company I really enjoy. As much as I may bitch and moan about how that agency took the piss so much with me, the chance that they took on me turned my life around.",1363081470

This would be an extremely poor example of fair use, and would really only dilute the positive meanings of ""fair use"".<p>Fair use is meant to preserve access to copyrighted works by the public that granted copyright in the first place--to maintain certain rights for the public and to ensure that any works built upon copyrighted works (whether that's through inspired creativity or just commentary on the original) aren't themselves held hostage by the original copyright holder.<p>Nothing in this example is transformative of the original work. The poster just released something that somebody else holds the copyright to. The educational aspect is an extremely weak argument; something merely existing in front of your eyes is not educational. The classic take on educational fair use for this would be taking minimal samples from the source and providing commentary upon them (why they did something the way they did, how they solved a problem that plagues a lot of developers, etc).<p>It's also certainly not a minimal sampling of the material. The code has been minified, but there appears to be a substantial portion of their UI code intact here, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is largely functional without much more work. It would be dishonest to compare 3MB of scripts to a final game including assets, and even with substantial commentary and insight added to the code, you would not be able to justify redistributing this amount of the source. Again, it isn't quoting from a larger source, it's providing the entire source for large portions of the game engine.<p>IP law aside, I feel the same way about this as I imagine I would have felt if the Doom 3 source had leaked early: no, you won't be able to play the game for free with it, and it is cool to see, but it's shitty that the people that actually wrote it had no say in its release.",1363080917

It was an interesting exercise, and I learned a lot. First I tried proving (((x:Type) -> LEM x) -> _|_ ->) _|_ to then apply double negation directly to this, but this is actually not possible (as far as I can see). The double negation needs to be inside the quantifier.<p>Maybe you can even write it simply like this with implicit parameters:<p><pre><code>    DNimpliesLEM : DN (LEM x) -> LEM x\n    DNimpliesLEM dn = dn notnotLEMproof</code></pre>",1363079172

I'll be absolutely clear - some people's data is going to be difficult to work intelligently with, and in those cases we'll shift much more of the burden to the integrator. The sweet spot is obviously people with fairly clean data models - if you've got a standard Ruby on Rails app using Active Record, for example, your data is pretty friendly.",1363079035

Both seem to use same JavaScript engine (V8) and it seems that using QtWebKit in headless browser scenarios in Linux environment seems to be a bit easier, but I'm kind of wondering why there seems to be more buzz around CE than QTWK. On obvious reason of course is that using QTWK in app ""forces"" you to use Qt in other parts of the app that can be a good / bad thing depending on the details.",1363079014

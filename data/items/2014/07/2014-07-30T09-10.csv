Sure, I read 1984 and Farenhiet 451 but the seemed like commentary about the future, what could become.  Apparently they were just as relevant when they were written.  Constant war with the &quot;enemy&quot;.  The threat of attack at any time.  Constant fear.  All so people could build their little empires inside the military and intelligence communities.  Build their bombs.  Spend that sweet tax-payer money.  Feel important.  Lie to the government.  The past seemed so legit and so ancient when I was growing up.  After 9/11 I had no idea history was repeating itself.  Now we have the ever present(statistically ridiculous) threat of &quot;terrorism&quot;.  The NSA needs more powers, more money; to protect us of course.  They WOULD say that because that&#x27;s how they get more money, more employees, more power.  Still lying to the government of course(weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?).  Now we have an ex-NSA head launching a venture charging companies 1 million a month to protect them!  Of course they&#x27;ll contract back to government.  And the NSA will tell use all about how we don&#x27;t need to worry about what they are doing, we just need to pay up.<p><i>sigh</i>",1406713352

NORAD... warned, with 99.9-per-cent certainty, that the Soviets had just launched a full-scale missile attack against North America... They later discovered that the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at Thule Airbase, in Greenland, had interpreted the moon rising over Norway as a missile attack from Siberia.<p>This is why numbers shouldn&#x27;t be reported with too many significant figures. I doubt the engineers thought the reports could be %99.9 certain, given that they&#x27;re extrapolated from noisy sensors, networked across huge distances and that the opponent is adversarial (actively trying to avoid detection).<p>Percentages can cause a false sense of certainty too; as Leonard Mlodinow points out in The Drunkard&#x27;s Walk about changing wine ratings from out-of-10 to percentages. We might be quite sure that an 8/10 compares favourably to a 7/10 but not to a 9/10; we can&#x27;t say the same about an %82 with an %83 and an %81.<p>If you&#x27;re forced to report percentages, or tenths of a percent, write the estimated error alongside.

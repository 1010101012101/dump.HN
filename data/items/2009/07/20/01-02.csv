So whenever something comes along that wipes me off my feet, I decide to pickup a new skill/hobby and focus on that as much as possible. I find it gives me something else to talk about when I'm with friends, instead of rehashing the ""woe is me, life sucks"" tale of the times. Because the experience is new, there are always things to look forward to. When my first serious relationship ended, I decided to become a racing fan and memorized all there was to know about various racing series. I've also become a gym nut, learned how to shave with a straight razor (and maintain them), become an expert at various video games, etc.<p>Unfortunately this past week I got into a stupid fight with a girl I'm in an ""it's complicated"" sort of relationship with.

713730,story,,,3,0,pruett,"A Startup’s Most Valuable Asset: The Team",http://www.techsoomer.com/startups-most-valuable-asset-team/,"Startup ventures are exciting, dynamic, and risky.  They require a balance between luck, skill, and timing.  Of all the essential elements regarding startup businesses, there is one particular element that remains paramount: the team members.<p>For many “financially-deficient” (aka bootstrapped) startups, choosing the correct team members/founders may be the most important decision the young company faces.  Despite this truth, it is all too common for startups to constuct their team with insufficient or unsuitable candidates.  This type of behavior is not just harmful, it’s potentially deadly for a young upstart business.<p>I see many startups invest most of their focus on things like: marketing strategies, business name / logo, and market position — before ever really considering the composition of their startup members.  The fundamental problem with this is simple: idea and strategies mean nothing with the wrong people in the driver seat.  It is critical to place the correct individuals in the correct positions in order to achieve maximum efficiency.  This becomes difficult as a startup begins developing ideas and executing particular strategies.\nHere are a few aspects to consider when constructing your startup’s fouding team.<p>Is your friend the “right” choice? Friends are the easiest and most convenient individuals to bring aboard your startup venture.  Friendly conversation does not necessarily translate into smart business tactics, however.  Your friend may be a great person to bounce ideas off of, but not the right business partner.  Take advantage of your friend status and mentally project them into a startup role.  From all that you know about that person, think about a few scenarios:<p><pre><code>    * how well do they handle stressful situations?\n    * do they possess perseverance or do they stop at the first sign of hardship?\n    * are they trustworthy?\n    * how well do they communicate?\n    * how do they handle uncertainty or chaotic situations?\n    * what is their level of dedication or passion towards projects?\n</code></pre>\nNo money, no problem.  Lack of cash is often considered a major startup obstacle.  And while this may be true in most circumstances, it does provide an indirect benefit in the case of bringing aboard team members.  Startups with little to no working capital are fueled by one thing: passion.  Bringing aboard individuals with no promise of monetary compensation ensures that they are in it for all the right reasons.  You can worry about salary and payroll after you ship your first unit.<p>Previous entrepreneurs welcome.  There are certain intangibles one learns from operating inside the trenches of a startup company that cannot be learned anywhere else.  This is why you should always look to bring aboard previous entrepreneurs given the chance.  The company benefits greatly from the individuals’ prior startup experience and you gain a trusted business partner who understands the difficulty associated with launching a business venture.<p>The most important point to remember is this: your startup’s most valuable asset is its team members…so choose your partners wisely!  Remember that at the end of the day, you and your team are the ones putting the ideas and strategies in place.  It’s not enough to have an idea, you need the physical manpower to execute them effectively.  A founding team needs to have the right balance of intelligence, innovation, and drive.  In order to achieve the correct balance, your team members must share a common passion while working towards shared goals.<p>trueventures-teammembersI saw a great affirmation of this belief when I came across a particular venture capital firm’s website, and noticed their portfolio companies.  True Ventures, an early stage tech venture firm, showcases their portfolio companies in a refreshing way.  If you notice, all of their investments are accompanied with a picture of the founding team.  Although it is just a picture, it establishes the old investment addage of: “We invest in individuals, not companies.”  This is something that we as entrepreneurs hear, but sometimes overlook.",1248054193
713729,comment,713705,713705,0,0,TriinT,,,"You have your entire life to pursue your interests and projects. That's not a lot of time, because one single lifetime is not enough for someone who is passionate about various topics and wants to find out more and more about them.<p>On the other hand, meeting a girl you find attractive and worth spending time with is not something that happens often. As you're still in your mid-20s, you may think that you'll have plenty of chances to meet other good girls. But soon you'll wake up and you'll be 35... and you'll have a different perspective on life.<p>It doesn't have to be either work OR the girl. You can have both worlds. You'll just decide what the optimal allocation of time is. Of course, if the girl thinks you're allocating too much time to your work, you relationship might not last. If you have the opportunity to be with someone you like, go for it. A stable and healthy personal life is great for one's productivity, and you still have 50 years or so to become a mini-Tesla ;-)<p>PS: be careful when idolizing athletes.

713722,comment,713648,713648,0,0,bockris,,,"About 4 years ago I was assigned to an internal project that was to provide a GUI CRUD interface in VB.Net to replace one written in curses on Linux.  There were 50-75 attributes for the main entity plus multiple hierachical subsets of sub-entities.  It was a mess.  The business user specified a complex GUI that would let you have different levels of users and allow fields to be protected and show warnings and error by changing the background color of the control, etc, etc.  Tons of boilerplate code and lots of changing conditions because the business user would come up with new requirements and conditions to test for.<p>To keep track of all of this I ended up specifying a lot of the rules in an XML file and used 'Cog' written by Ned Batchelder.   <a href=""http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/</a> to generate the boilerplate code.  Cog is different than any other code generation tool I had used before because you write your generation code in commented lines in your normal source file.  When you run Cog, it finds these special lines and replaces the code between the markers with whatever code is supposed to be generated.  No other code is touched so it survived a round trip through an IDE like VS.\nIt worked great for what I was doing and I used it heavily but the project was thankfully cancelled before I could finish.",1248053802

For example,<p><pre><code>    var closures = [];\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n    {\n        var j = i;\n        closures[i] = function() { alert(j); }\n    }\n    closures[0](); // outputs 9, WTF?\n</code></pre>\nHow to fix it:<p><pre><code>    var closures = [];\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) (function()\n    {\n        var j = i*i;\n        closures[i] = function() { alert(j); }\n    })(i)\n    closures[0](); // outputs 0 as it should</code></pre>",1228729972

389694,comment,389401,389401,0,0,pc,,,"Objective-C: @property requires duplication of the ivar type, and doesn't imply @synthesize. (To do either of these would stop it being a simple macro, but that elegance comes at the expense of a frustrating amount of unnecessary typing.)<p>Common Lisp: built-in functions aren't generic. Tedious verbosity of defclass. No literal syntax for hash tables. Debuggers so much worse than they should be.<p>Smalltalk: having to manually implement getters/setters. Awkwardness of code generation.<p>Ruby: gems not having a single canonical name (what you require != what you install).",1228729928
389693,comment,389240,389660,0,0,mdasen,,,"Ahhhh!<p>Ok, that can be fair although I'd probably consider that a technical requirement.  Really, you'll find the same problem with Merb and Django.  There are a bunch of people who have done small things (say, a todo list) in them that don't really know the framework.  While the Django community doesn't tend to have the same attitude that some of the Rails community has, it's a really small community.  Finding good Django programmers is hard.  While some in the Django community would argue that it's just Python (vs. Rails' more DSL take on Ruby), it's more than simply Python.<p>It's hard to hire programmers in general.  Django and Merb are much smaller than Rails in terms of exposure and number of programmers.  While you might not get as many pretenders or as many bad attitude people, there are simply less people.<p>I wish I had something more helpful to say here.  If you're looking to hire Django people, djangogigs.com and djangopeople.net are good places to post/look.  I really think Merb would be the better choice as a lot of the code can be reused - you could completely reuse the models and templates which would probably save you a huge amount of development not to mention require no alteration to your database.",1228729846

389689,comment,389526,389526,0,0,jfornear,,,"Regarding subscription pricing, if you are going to charge and you want to keep the price under $10/mo, charge <i>at least</i> $5.99/mo because a) you can get away with it, and b) $3.99/mo could make your product seem cheap. IMO $5.99 is close to the cost of a fast food meal, which most people don't hesitate when faced with.<p>I don't know how much thought you put into the $3.99/mo, but there is a lot of research out there that supports pricing higher for reasons none other than to create the perception of value. Interesting topic to look into, either way.",1228729412

Unfortunately, I had said ""No"" almost as soon as the first five words were out of his mouth.<p>So, then he was forced to tell me about Tcl (which I had never used) and went on to explain that Tcl was a really easy language for people to learn (which he illustrated with various interesting examples) and that it incorporated a complete regular expression engine from a lot of power was derived.<p>Right there, I blurted out ""Don't you think those two things are contradictory?  It can't be easy to learn and have regular expressions since regular expressions are one of the hardest things for a novice to pick up"".<p>His eyes sort of bugged out of his head and he said, ""Oh.  Perhaps you are right.  I hadn't thought of that"".<p>Luckily for me it turned out that making John have a novel thought was the right way to impress him.  Despite apparently having a big ego he turned out to be the best boss I ever had, I learned an enormous amount from him and later we co-founded Electric Cloud.",1228729287

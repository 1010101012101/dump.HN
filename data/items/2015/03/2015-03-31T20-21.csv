9299832,comment,9297946,9299496,0,0,dalke,,,"I quoted the author&#x27;s views, which is that as a result &quot;a Swede is deprived of initiative and confidence from the start.&quot; This sounds like a negative viewpoint. I will quote from the previous paragraphs of the book (&quot;Of Swedish Ways&quot; by Lilly Lorénzen, instructor in Swedish at the University of Minnesota and the American Swedish Institute, and &#x27;builder of Swedish heritage in America&#x27;.)<p>> &quot;I cannot remember that my father or mother at any time made any visible display of affection for me, and sometimes I ached inside for a little love,&quot; they say. ... But it was not only the want of expressed love that made the childhood pinched and meager. It was the deliberate thwarting of all efforts for self-expression, the deliberate holding down of tendencies to excel.&quot; ... As I grew up the allure of the mirror made me sneak a glance now and then, only to be reprimanded by mother. To look in the mirror was forbidden! &quot;Du ser ingenting ut!&quot; [You don&#x27;t look like anything!] ... To be told over and over again that one&#x27;s looks equal nothing would, and did, subdue any attempt to enhance one&#x27;s negligible features. ... In mature years when I asked my mother what her idea was, she said: &quot;I was so afraid that my girls were being vain so I had to squelch any tendencies in that direction.&quot; But childhood frustrations have a way of ... expression later on. Mine is a silk ribbon tucked in my hair!<p>This makes it pretty clear that the author disagrees with her Swedish cultural upbringing. I quoted the mother&#x27;s response to show that you have a good point. But this can&#x27;t really be at the heart of Jante Lagen, because it was that generation of Swedes worked to change the culture. If you know Swedish culture, this was before the Ni fråga, in the era where men were referred to often by job title, and people seldom talked to each other.<p>In modern Sweden parents do show affection for their children, and don&#x27;t (at least not that I&#x27;ve heard) say that their children are nothings. It was proper in older Swedish culture to beat their children with a rod behind the woodshed. In 1979, Sweden became the first nation to ban corporal punishment of children.<p>So yes, in both the personal and historical context, these views were seen as negative and rejected. I therefore disagree with your conclusion that it&#x27;s cultural chauvinism. These are people who disagreed with their own culture, and changed it.<p>Here&#x27;s another quote from the same book:<p>> Could the American-born epithet, &quot;the dumb Swede,&quot; have anything to do with the concept of perfection that every Swedish emigrant carried with him to the new country? ... Could it be that his laconic answers, his lack of ready banter, even after he had learned the language reasonably well, coined the phrase? There are those who maintain that fellow workers in camps and workshops initiated the expression, &quot;the dumb Swede.&quot; Whatever the cause, the steadfast, silent Swede suffered under it, and many descendants have tales to tell of the resentment it fostered.<p>In modern parlance, being called a &quot;dumb Swede&quot; was a microagression, with negative emotional consequences.<p>Are you a cultural relativist who believes it is inappropriate to make any negative comments about someone else&#x27;s culture? The modern Sweden, in the body of Margot Wallström, Sweden&#x27;s foreign minister, disagrees with you. Saudi Arabia recalled their ambassador to Sweden after she criticized human rights in Saudi Arabia. Do you think she wrong to make those criticisms?",1427835487

Each course would need a game that suited the academic level of the pupil. I suspect game companies would be eager to fill this need, as long as some sort of monetization method could be setup?

9299824,comment,9295606,9299659,0,0,gfodor,,,"This is the standard story about deflation, but the idea that a slightly deflationary environment will suddenly change purchase behavior has always struck me as a bit academic. The average consumer doesn&#x27;t buy stuff because they think inflation is going to cause it to become more expensive in the future, they buy stuff because they need it. It seems borderline absurd to suggest that consumers are going to reconsider buying something because in a year it will be a few % cheaper in price.<p>However, I do agree that a persistent deflationary economy (and the corresponding expectations that it will continue) will have... interesting effects on interest rates, debt, and corporate spending. But I still am not sold on the idea that it&#x27;s a de facto negative thing. I think saying &quot;deflation = bad&quot; oversimplifies the lessons to be learned from the Great Depression but unfortunately that&#x27;s the lesson we&#x27;re taught.",1427835432

I&#x27;m happy they don&#x27;t have quite that much power anymore.<p>The reason I say it was scary was that it was a moment in time where you could watch a class of computers from one generation to the next get <i>worse</i> because of limits imposed by Microsoft on OEMs. I bought a Dell Mini 9 just before they switched to the Mini 10. The Mini 10 actually had <i>half</i> the memory capacity of the Mini 9 (1GB vs 2GB in the Mini 9), because Microsoft defined &quot;netbook&quot; to have a maximum memory size and CPU power, which was lower than what netbooks had already climbed up to. Microsoft didn&#x27;t want to see their margins decrease on &quot;real&quot; computers, but didn&#x27;t want to cede the low end market to Linux. They saw the power of cheap then, and will probably see the power of cheap now. The difference is they don&#x27;t have enough clout with enough manufacturers to dumb down these small computers.<p>So, yeah, I&#x27;d be surprised if they don&#x27;t respond. They already have very low cost Windows Phone licenses in order to compete with Android (but it&#x27;s not really working). Honestly, I believe we&#x27;re entering a post-Microsoft world, even on the desktop.

Implemented a Lisp in a Lisp always feels like a certain amount of hand-waving without feeling like I&#x27;ve really <i>made</i> something. Look, here&#x27;s how to implement a JavaScript interpreter in JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    eval(someCode);
</code></pre>
What I like is seeing all of the steps a typical real-world language implementation goes through, just in minimal form. To that end, a while back I wrote an interpreter for a BASIC-like language in a single Java source file. It tokenizes, parses, and interprets. It uses common real-world techniques for all of those:<p>It uses a hand-rolled state machine for tokenizing. Recursive descent for parsing. And the interpreter uses the visitor pattern to walk the AST.<p>Mine also, strangely unlike many of these so-called &quot;teaching&quot; toy languages, has documentation. I don&#x27;t understand the point of a tiny language for people to learn from if you made it tiny by removing all of the comments. :(<p>And, to try to avoid leading the reader astray, it calls out any shortcuts it makes.

GC. It leans on Java for that.<p>2. Compile to bytecode or some other representation. It&#x27;s a simple tree walker, like Ruby 1.8.<p>If you want to learn more about <i>those</i>, take a look at:<p><a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a>",1427833419

To wit, that a college education is more valuable than the credential.<p>> If it costs X to educate 10% of the population, it takes more than 2X to educate 20%.<p>Why would the cost of providing education to more people increase as a multiple of the baseline costs?<p>> And since there is no relief from lowered enrollment, prices will stay high.<p>Restricting enrollment would increase costs as there is more competition among prospective students for the service. Students would have to outbid each other, not merely outperform each other to secure a spot.<p>> Now college is something everyone&#x27;s entitled too... [sic]<p>An education is what we should entitle them to. As you note, colleges have been locked for decades in a competition for students by investing in new buildings, amenities, and sports with no regard for the effect on costs because of the price inelasticity of demand. And it has been a safe investment because student loans & grants have been so readily available.<p>The best price controls available to us are exercised by holding the institutions accountable for certain outcomes (like excessive dropout & loan default rates), by providing an equivalent service at a lower cost (something like Obama&#x27;s &quot;free community college&quot; option), and by making student loan debt dischargeable like most other debts. The ready availability of capital is part of what has driven up costs.<p>> You should look at how many drop out after $20,000 or $50,000 worth of student loan debt.<p>The national graduation rate was approximately 60% in 2012 [1], while the national student load default rate was 13.7% in 2014 [2]. Students who do not graduate are several times more likely to end up in default, but it is still a manageable risk overall for investors because student loans are so difficult to discharge and because most people will eventually pay them back, and still worth it for students because they still have a positive net ROI.<p>[1] <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40</a>

- People committing suicide because they can&#x27;t absolutely prove to themselves that they&#x27;re not a pedophile. (If you&#x27;re scared/upset about the idea of being a pedophile, you&#x27;re most definitely not, please go get help.)
- People washing their hands until they&#x27;re cracked and bloody because of contamination fears.
- Mothers neglecting their babies because they cannot handle the thoughts they keep having of throwing their baby out the window or stabbing it with a kitchen knife. They&#x27;re scared they&#x27;re a monster and that somehow they&#x27;ll lose control and actually do these horrible things that pop into their mind.<p>Everybody gets these thoughts from time to time, but OCD sufferers are plagued by them, and the OCD complicates things further by making it very, very, very difficult to accept the fact that these thoughts mean absolutely nothing and that they&#x27;re most definitely not going to lose control and do something hugely against their morals. They&#x27;ll ruminate on these thoughts over and over and over again, involuntarily, getting more and more disturbed and upset. Compulsions form as ways to attempt relieving the anxiety from these obsessive and intrusive thoughts. An OCD sufferer will do absolutely anything to try to silence these horrifying thoughts: avoiding children, taking pictures of their stove or door locks on their phone, neglecting their children, etc. Here&#x27;s the thing: Trying to ignore these thoughts only makes them worse, keeping them in your head, and causing a vicious feedback loop that makes OCD very easy to spiral out of control.<p>It&#x27;s true that articles like this and modern media in general unfortunately continue to perpetuate widespread misconceptions. I don&#x27;t point this out because I&#x27;m just some overly-sensitive person with OCD and I don&#x27;t like my condition trivialized — frankly, I couldn&#x27;t care less about that. The problem is that there are MANY people out there who are suffering from OCD and have absolutely no clue because their understanding of OCD is so far from reality.<p>I&#x27;m a perfect example of this. I&#x27;m a 25 year old (software engineer), and was just diagnosed with OCD at the beginning of this month. Prior to my diagnosis, I had NO CLUE what OCD was. All I knew is that I was disorganized and messy, so there&#x27;s no way I had that &quot;OCD thing&quot;... Oh, how  wrong I was. After learning about the condition, it&#x27;s crystal clear that I&#x27;ve been suffering from this condition as long as I can remember. I now understand that OCD has played a very major role in my life, being responsible for enormous amounts of depression, anxiety, and even suicide attempts. If I would have known what OCD <i>really</i> was and not just how it&#x27;s portrayed in media, I could have gotten the help I needed much, much earlier.<p>In closing, I just want to say that there is no permanent cure for OCD.

You can&#x27;t invest 5 dollars in a company 1000 times until you have no money left.<p>Also gambling odds are heavily controlled. Could you imagine a pit boss telling you &quot;Table 5&#x27;s die have an unfair advantage to land on 7&quot;? Conversely, people raising money tell you exactly why they will succeed and why they are a better choice than some other company. These people can be very convincing as well.<p>When gambling, bets are easy to understand. You make a static bet before the wheel spins. When investing, size of the pot depends on how well the company was valued when you made that bet. The next players may decide that the company was only worth half what you paid.

Voicemail is handled by a similar app, and each person also receives a Slack notification for an incoming call or voice message.<p>Lookup by Twilio is a bit different than OpenCNAM, but also pretty similar. They&#x27;re both pretty affordable, though in the end, I&#x27;ll likely create our own lookup database that we can customize.<p>For me, the most immediately useful info is the state/province as well as country of the incoming call. It appears that with Twilio Local, on the latter comes through. I did some tests of Lookup with a bunch of numbers, and the additional info that comes through for the paid portion of things doesn&#x27;t seem that particularly useful. The (free) &quot;national_format&quot; is nice, but I&#x27;d say the most valuable part of the service is quickly identifying invalid and VoIP-based numbers.",1427832725

The opportunity is risky to be sure, only for educated investors as ready and able to lose money as to make money. Information is limited and protections are only as good as the integrity of the participants. That puts a premium on honestly, transparency, and strict adherence to securities regulations.<p>The American economy is built on liquidity and rapid turn-around of investments: new company founders, investors, even venture capitalists and private equity fund managers got where they are because an early exit allowed them to cash in early gains in order to re-invest in the market. This used to take a few years, but now, due to market changes, they will no longer see a penny until their company goes public after an average 7.5-year wait. More likely, their company will fail despite years of hard work and success, leaving them nothing. Secondary markets are a relief valve for these founders, early angel investors, and current and former employees.<p>When shares cannot be traded, even the most ambitious and brilliant entrepreneurs are locked in for the better part of a decade, waiting for something to happen. If they have liquidity they can start something new — perhaps a cure to disease, a new media company, or one that launches rocket ships. This liquidity is how many of today’s great companies got their start.<p>Collectively, we owe it to founders and investors, and the economy, to create reliable secondary markets. That’s why Equidate was founded.",1427832115

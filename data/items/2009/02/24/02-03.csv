There are a lot of other companies that do what Twitter does. Friendfeed, Jaiku are the two that come fastest to mind.<p>I'm certain Twitter won't die, because there <i>are</i> a lot of options open to them.

The kids who did one thing did their thing, the other kids did the other. The whole era of bullying disappeared when we all turned 14 or so.<p>Mike is running a start-up. I can respect that. He sacrifices a lot of quality to be the first man on the scene: I don't like that, but I'm impressed as hell at his track record. He has a history of being a socialite and a bit of a jerk, neither of which I like, but at the same time that doesn't make him a bad person, just a person period.<p>I spent my high school life fiddling with computers, writing, and talking to teachers, and I had incidents of bullying myself.

They should have not attacked torrenting in general, they needed to attack the fact that Pirate Bay did nothing to remove torrents even by request.

Though I look at the cartoon as more of an over all social commentary about our current state of affairs; not ""this is our situation.""<p>All too often the copyright lawyers said DMCA takedowns against just such videos. Heck they've sent takedowns to youtube because a person was singing copy written music (<i>cough</i> viacom <i>cough</i>).<p>As someone already said and I'm sure many others will agree, the current system is broken.<p>The internet allows for piracy at a scale that far surpasses the scale of sharing tapes among friends, but it's not going away and need to be capitalized on. It's a dirt cheap distribution method that should be used to it's fullest potential.<p>The argument that a pirated copy equals a lost sale is total bunk. I would have bought maybe 1% of what I've downloaded. Why? Cause the other 99% is crap. And I don't know that until I've heard it. I don't hear it until I download it. The radios are owned and controlled so that the one good song on the whole album is played, and the rest isn't.<p>If someone can find it I'd be grateful, but WIRED had a chart in an article sometime about 2004 showing that: average length of song is trending down, number of songs per album trending down, number of new artists trending down, number of albums per artist trending down, cost per album trending up, piracy trending up, and sales trending down.  So yeah, it must be solely the fault of the internet and those dirty pirates that the music business is slowly falling.....",1235443022

To Twitter's cheaper competitors? How are <i>they</i> going to stay in business?<p>Rather than just die, Twitter will monetize. Though I doubt that they would monetize by simply charging people to <i>read</i> Tweets. That's much too blunt. There are more subtle methods of throttling the free-account users and thereby encouraging them to pay: limit the outgoing tweet rate, limit the rate of direct messaging, limit the number of followers or followees, lower the number of allowed characters by five for each successive tweet that you write on a given day...<p>Here's an idea: charge for low latency. If you're on the free plan at Twitter you can make as many tweets as you like and they will be sent to your followers and posted to the public site... <i>eventually</i>. Within, say, 2 hours (or 4 hours, or 8 hours). But if you want <i>instant</i> Tweeting you've got to buy a (fairly cheap) subscription.<p>Any such change will cause an uproar, so Twitter won't do it unless they have to. But if they have to, I expect they will. They're not just going to fold up and die.",1235442946

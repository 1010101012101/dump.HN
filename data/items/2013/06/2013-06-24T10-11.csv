There is nothing wrong in high income gap. It&#x27;s existence is just an evidence that society works as expected.<p>Redistribution is just a way of punishing smart and hardworking people for their success and reward the rest of society for their laziness. This would surely end in a disaster: people loose motivation to do anything, because they cannot see any correlation between their effort and income.

5932054,comment,5931322,5931322,2,0,flyinglizard,,,"I see more problems than benefits.<p>1. Poverty is a relative term. Giving the entire population a basic income would shift everyone up, but ultimately it&#x27;s a zero sum game. Obviously, the additional income will be marginal for high earners and the income gap will largely remain.<p>2. Massive distribution of money tends to be inflationary. As purchasing power and demand go up, so does the market pricing. Think of rent prices around poor neighborhoods for example.<p>3. It will not mitigate the &quot;reverse Darwinism&quot; that occurs across the socioeconomic layers. High earners have neutral or negative population growth, while the poor are procreating at a much higher rate. This phenomena crosses communities, countries and continents. It&#x27;s the reason some rich European countries have declining indigenous population, with any growth attributed to poor immigrants.<p>4. It reduces the incentive to adapt to the new employment situation.<p>5. It does nothing to curb to social unrest that will happen due to income gaps. I don&#x27;t want to sound like &quot;The Man&quot;, but in effect this has the potential to make the income gap much more volatile; a large portion of the population that&#x27;s idle and feels neglected is a massive unrest waiting for a cause.<p>The talks of automation as if it&#x27;s the end of the materialistic society - as everything is produced effortlessly and cost effectively - are premature. We&#x27;ll be there when we ultimately master the matter at a particle level (think of the Culture novels). 
Society can, and will adapt to the added manufacturing capabilities with strong demand for better products and services. In fact, I think automation will be the saving grace of manufacturing in the first world nations.<p>As controversial as it sounds, I think the solution lies in balancing the growth across the different socioeconomic levels. There should be a policy of encouraging growth across the upper echelons of society, while discouraging the growth among the lower ranks:<p>1. Immediately, it will reduce poverty levels;<p>2. It will provide a better opportunity to take care of low income families, including government sponsored education, health and food programs;<p>3. In the long run, it will be the most effective redistribution tool of wealth. For every kid the Walton family had, each of the others had billions less in inheritance. 
Accumulation of individual wealth is greatly amplified when successful families make 1 or 2 children. If they have an average of 4 children, the transfer of wealth between and across generations will be more reasonable.<p>The current situation of the financially weakest population multiplying in the quickest rate is bad for everyone (first and foremost to themselves); it is a demographic and economic dead end. No matter how much you try patching it with wealth redistribution, you WILL eventually &quot;run out of other people&#x27;s money&quot;.",1372070617

5932033,comment,5931322,5932012,6,0,nkoren,,,"There are two answers to this:<p>First of all, the idea of basic income is that it is universal: there won&#x27;t be a divide between those who have basic income but not work, and those who have work but not basic income. <i>Everybody</i> will have basic income; the divide will merely be between those who have work and those who don&#x27;t.<p>The solution this divide is to eliminate the minimum wage, which acts as a significant hurdle to creating employment. In a basic-income world, there is no more moral argument for minimum wage to exist, because basic sustenance no longer comes from labour. Everybody will have sufficient food and shelter whether they work or not, so the exploitation of labour is no longer possible, and the safeguard of minimum wage is no longer needed. In a basic income world, labour becomes a privilege for both the employee <i>and</i> the employer.<p>Eliminating minimum wages means that employment can become a much smoother continuum of activities, rather than the sustenance-or-nothing proposition that it is right now. This opens up a vast range of lower-wage job opportunities, which people could purse when they <i>want</i> to, not actually because they <i>need</i> to. Want to earn 2/hr working in a community theatre? No problem. Want to earn 50/week helping to organise a supper club or being an assistant at a hackerspace? Go for it. Under a minimum wage regime, it&#x27;s not even legal to employ people in this capacity; under a basic income regime, the distinction between &quot;hobby&quot; and &quot;job&quot; will blur into irrelevance. This means that you will be able to create dramatically <i>more</i> work -- and higher-quality work, because it would only be things that people pursue out of choice rather than necessity -- with a basic income than you could ever have without one.<p>EDIT -- As to how to handle the transition period: phase in the Basic Income at the same rate that you phase out Minimum Wage and all other forms of income support. A good Basic Income should be roughly equivalent to a good minimum wage; in most countries this works out to be about 50% of the mean individual income. If the Basic Income payments are phased in at the same rate that the minimum wage and other benefits are phased out, then there will be virtually no &quot;losers&quot;. High-earners will get a little bump from the Basic Income; low-earners will see their take-home pay unchanged, but they will be increasingly less reliant on their jobs for it. This will put them in a better bargaining position vis-a-vis undesirable jobs, while new types of low-wage desirable jobs will become possible as the minimum wage is reduced. Do this transition over a course of a decade and it should be relatively smooth.",1372069861

5932021,comment,5870663,5870663,2,0,powatom,,,"My girlfriend is a wedding photographer so I have something of an insight into why you might be having this experience.<p>The RAW files are the (as the name suggests) raw, unedited versions of your photographs. Photographers are generally unwilling to provide these files as there is often a huge difference between the RAW image and the final, edited image. There is a &#x27;branding&#x27; concern here - if you take the RAW files and start showing them to people, then in the photographer&#x27;s mind you are showing them an unfinished product. Nobody wants anything but their best work out on display - so if you are intending to do this, then the photographer wants to be reimbursed for the potential damage you may be doing to their brand. Whether you feel that this is justified or not is irrelevant, if that&#x27;s how the photographer feels, then that&#x27;s how they feel. Deal with it.<p>Additionally, part of the package you buy is the editing process that the photographer undertakes. The RAW file is the raw material, and the JPG is the end result. Demanding the RAW files suggests that you are unhappy with the final result, and would like to re-edit the photos to suit your liking. This is likely to be perceived as an insult to the photographer&#x27;s skill. I&#x27;m guessing you have at least some level of confidence in the photographer&#x27;s editing abilities otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be going with them in the first place - but you have to understand that there is a significant amount of work involved between the RAW input and the JPG output - the photographer isn&#x27;t just doing a straight file conversion.<p>Finally - access to the RAW files puts the photographer at risk of you publishing the images with different editing and similar (or higher) quality. The increase in the copyright licence fee is aimed to offset this risk.<p>To summarise:<p>1: The photographer provides a full-day of foot-work (being at the wedding), and then up to a few weeks of editing the RAW images to make your special day look as fantastic as you remember it being.<p>2: The photographer needs to protect their brand - surrendering the RAW images means you are free to add lens flare and other shitty editing to their raw materials, and thereby doing damage to their brand.<p>3: RAW files = copyright risk in general.<p>4: A personal use licence is the norm unless you&#x27;re willing to pay a premium. The photographer needs to blog the photos, to use them in promotional materials, and to always have those photos connected with his brand. He doesn&#x27;t need (or want) you plastering them all over the place and using them for god-knows-what purpose.<p>I would suggest the following:<p>1: Properly define what exactly both of you mean by &#x27;personal use&#x27;. What do you actually want to do with the photographs? If it&#x27;s anything other than &#x27;make copies for my family&#x27;, then you&#x27;re probably asking too much for the licence you&#x27;re negotiating. It is normal to put things like disaster recovery as part of the deal, so that if you ever need to recover copies of the photographs then you can do so. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to sell the photographs on, though.<p>2: Negotiate on the resolution, but not the format. You are buying edited photos, not RAW images. Remember the process. Your RAW images will NOT look the same as the JPG end product, and in fact many photographers feel that the RAW images are bad. Imperfections, poor lighting etc are the whole reason that an editing process exists in the first place. The photographer needs to protect their brand.<p>3: If you are only concerned about resolution and not the quality (i.e composition, style etc) of the image itself, then re-negotiate your contract to remove the editing work. Your photographer will probably run a mile.<p>> Am I wrong in approaching this as a case where I hire a man for his skill and artistry and expect to keep the work product?<p>Yes, you are - because that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re asking. You&#x27;re asking to keep the product, the raw materials, and all of the rights to use that product for any purpose whatsoever.<p>In my honest opinion, you&#x27;re being a little too forward. Some photographers are just very protective of their work (it is their art, remember) - and the whole RAW thing is likely to push a few buttons because you are effectively voiding the hard work that goes into the editing process. YMMV with other photographers, but that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a market: if you like this photographer&#x27;s work, then stick with him and drop the RAW thing. If not, then find somebody else who&#x27;ll provide the RAW files.<p>What you need to do is outline what it is you intend to do with the photographs. When this is clear your photographer may be more accommodating. I would fully expect him to charge you more, though.<p>EDIT: Removed the suggestion that the &#x27;customer is not right&#x27;. Apologies for including this in the first place, but what I meant to suggest is that your expectation of the service is in conflict with the photographer&#x27;s perception of the service they provide. Until you can come to some agreement around this, you will have issues. For the photographer, this is a business and their art form. Asking them to put their art in the hands of somebody who may alter it or otherwise &#x27;damage&#x27; it is a risky and emotional prospect for them.  If you don&#x27;t care about this, then you&#x27;re probably best finding another photographer who will give you exactly what you want without questions.",1372069363

It&#x27;s someone (or several people) rampaging through all your possessions. Ripping open every closet, tearing everything out, going through all your personal stuff, stealing your expensive suit (you know, the one you got married in), stealing your credit and insurance cards, your passport, your letters from the bank with the security codes. Taking your grandfather&#x27;s watch, the silver thing your grandmothers gave you. Going through every closet, stealing the spare keys of your car, your bike, your house... You can&#x27;t sleep the next few nights as they now have keys of everything. You need new keys and what to do about your car, your bike? They also took your backup USB disks. Those contain your documents, your projects, your logins and passwords... It will take you months and thousands of dollars to get everything like it was.

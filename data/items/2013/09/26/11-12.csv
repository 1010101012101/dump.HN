At first, ultrabooks were supposed to be laptops with good battery life, high-resolution IPS screen and a SSD. Also it should be thin, which I think is meaningless, but whatever.<p>However, it seems that this disappeared somewhere, and now laptop with 1366*786 15&quot; TN screen and rotary storage (with a measly 16 GB &quot;SSD cache&quot; that does pretty much nothing to make it faster), but it is required to have Windows 8 and touchscreen.<p>The brand lost meaning, it went from &quot;Apple quality from someone else than Apple&quot; (so we can buy nice computer without supporting walled garden approach)",1380196779

I have heard it has a lot of bugs, can be very slow and in rare instances deletes data</i><p>Good question.<p>I have mixed impressions of owncloud so far depending on what area of the product you are using.<p>The good parts: Contact and calendering managament. Just works. Integrates nicely with Android, Thunderbird, etc. <i>Not</i> very good synching back to Google though. I don&#x27;t really care about that, but now you know.<p>The not so good parts: I tried running it on my NAS, because that would be the storage-backend for the file-sync service anyway. I quickly discovered that the code is not <i>near</i> efficient enough to be deployed on underpowered devices like this. It needs optimization, or to be put on proper hardware. I chose the latter and redeployed.<p>On my NAS, with enough data getting synched across clients could take <i>days</i>. So don&#x27;t even think about putting this on a Raspberry Pi or something silly like that.<p>The worse: Using owncloud&#x27;s files-module as a drop-in Dropbox replacement, you will be surprised by how well supported all kinds of platforms are. If you treat it as a Dropbox replacement though, you will encounter issues.<p>I tried putting my code/project/build-folders under owncloud and hack away, much like I&#x27;ve done with Dropbox. Even with a limited amount of clients, you will quickly encounter at least some bugs. The most annoying thing I encountered was probably getting <i>conflicts</i> when only one of the clients had updated the file.<p>The client updated the file, called back to owncloud with the changes, and then got a response back that this update cannot be done cleanly.<p>It then proceeded to the code/build/project files involved in the conflict and rename the local and the &quot;server&quot;-version to $file.conflict345678543 & $file.conflict1234567 or something to that effect. Needless to say that broke my code, my build and needed to be cleaned up.<p>If you think that sounds annoying, imagine it happening several times during a 30 minute coding session.<p>So yeah. The owncloud file-service currently suffers and cannot be treated as a drop-in replacement for Dropbox. Hopefully it will get there, but outside coding, I haven&#x27;t experienced anything like that and it seems to chug along just fine. With a high CPU-usage though.<p>So yeah. There are good, not so good and directly bad things about it. If it fits your use-case is up to you.",1380196363

Those developers want to get closer to the metal and able to achieve more with the GPU(s) on their PC without the API getting in the way of this effort. &quot;More with more&quot; is the term used by Raja and it couldn&#x27;t be more spot on.\nAMD listened to developer feedback and entered this venture with Johan Andersson leading the charge. Johan has a passion for writing efficient code that can allow him to accomplish his technical vision and Mantle exists to serve this purpose.<p>Mantle is not for every developer. It is a low-level graphics API designed to drive the GPU in the most efficient manner. This level of access requires a bit more development effort than existing APIs to reap the rewards it provides.<p>AMD remains committed to support DirectX and OpenGL and to keep optimizing our drivers for those APIs. Mantle is an option that some developers may choose, but it does not affect those that wish to keep using existing APIs.<p>Some technical concerns are mentioned on this thread. The Mantle API has been in design and development for more than 2 years and rest assured we&#x27;ve had some time to think about the best way to address those (and loads of others).<p>More technical details about Mantle will be revealed in due course. Johan is a keynote speaker at the AMD Developer Summit (11-14 November, San Jose).<p>Nick - Gaming Engineering Manager, AMD</i>",1380196349

6449975,story,,,3,2,shicky,"Ask HN: Training/skills to become a good QA engineer",,"I&#x27;ve done a search on HN for similar questions before but it seems they get distracted by questions regarding if the op meant standard QA or test automation.<p>So for background I&#x27;m a CS grad who doesn&#x27;t seem to have a great ability to develop, at least not yet.  I went into finance and worked for two years in support/development and got on very well, unfortunately my application got quite popular and therefore the team was heavily regulated, this meant I went to strictly support and low level so I wasn&#x27;t happy with the lack of complexity.<p>As a result I decided to try a different industry and have went back to technology and got a job as a QA engineer.  I am fully aware I cannot rely solely on my employer to provide the skills necessary to become a good QA Engineer.<p>Therefore I wish to firstly cement soft skills as a good QA tester which I believe I already have. i.e. an eye for detail, enjoy a good puzzle.  What technical skills do people feel are required to be a good &#x27;manual&#x27; tester?<p>Lastly the main reason I took this jump was to get into automated testing as I believe it will allow a jump in complexity and perhaps a side move to development when I&#x27;m good enough.  Where do I start in becoming good at automated testing?<p>The standard advice for a dev is to start developing personal projects?  What about a tester?  Is it the same so then you can test your project thoroughly?  I&#x27;ve often seen it said you should be testing OTHER peoples code mainly.  So how can I get this exposure?<p>Just for additional info, I&#x27;ve been researching a bit myself and have come across a few products like selenium to play with and reading the google testing blog.  On top of this I&#x27;ve started two udacity classes, one for software testing and one for debugging.  Any further suggestions?  Any decent books to help me feel a little less lost in my current situation?<p>Thanks for any advice you can provide",1380193694

Just like any other payments company without a vault. Vault is not an issue if the customers making one-time purchases and there&#x27;s no recurring subscription.<p>If your biz is with recurring billing then you don&#x27;t want to run parallel payment systems or ask users to resubscribe whenever there&#x27;s a need to move somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;m in EU as well and things do not look good for small startups with a need for recurring &quot;mutable&quot; payments. The only reliable option is braintreepayments but 100eur minimum is high and there&#x27;s an uncertainty with the pricing because of the rumors on Paypal/eBay takeover.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for Stripe to expand to all EU countries. PayMill is very similar to Stripe but their biggest problem for me is not having the vault -- I would not be able to transfer my subscriptions to a new provider if needed (AFAIK, please prove me wrong).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mangopay.com/about-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mangopay.com/about-us/</a>",1380193419

This would be a limit defined by the anatomical limits of human eye. There is a limit of absolute darkness (relative to the eye) and there is also a limit in the brightness of the light that the human eye can safely be exposed to. In this defined range there is a limit in granularity that the human eye can distinguish. I am not aware if such a definition exists, but I am aware that a display to respect the &quot;true brightness&quot; is impossible (for the mere fact that the light reflected from our faces sheds upon the dark portions of the display, and those dark portions can not perfectly absorb the external supplement of light).",1380193254

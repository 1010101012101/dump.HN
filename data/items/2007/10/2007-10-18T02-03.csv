I think at the heart of every entrepreneur is a contrarian. I know that I'm just the type of person that if everybody else went left, I'd go right.<p>
I don't see a conflict between failing fast and going deep. That's because when I'm in the mode to qualify the work (before I spend 8 weeks on it), I try to scope it down. Am I getting into six months of development effort? If so, is that because I want to make my technology hard to reproduce? Or is it just feature bloat -- I'm putting the kitchen sink in. I know now that I'm failing fast (giving it 4-12 weeks once approved) with small timeboxes, I'm seeing a lot more progress. Chase the users, right?<p>
I don't think I'd go back to long timeboxes again, although I might very well chop off some really gnarly problems and chew on them a little bit at a time :)",1192675415

69466,comment,69413,69413,0,0,huherto,,,"I am currently applying for a management position. My boss tells me that that I will have to leave the technical side. I guess I don't understand this corporate culture, I have been running my own consulting firm for 8 years and I am new at this job. I don't see why you can not do anything technical after you are a ""manager"". My vision of a manager is more like that of a coach that helps the developers improve their skills, and can discuss technical approaches with them. A see a development manager like a technical leader that has a good vision of where technology will go.<p>I suppose these activities will take up my time in this position:
- Meetings. (I could handle a couple of hours a day)
- Evaluations. (kind of bad)
- Recruitment. (I actually like this)
- Budgeting. (bad)
- <p>I would really like to do this:
- Talk and help the developers of what they are doing.
- Research new technology.
- Look for ways to improve the development environment. like tools and techniques.
- Organize study groups.<p>Am I being too innocent? What do you think?<p>My point is that the role of a technical manager doesn't necessarily have to be just boring clerical work.",1192675064
69465,comment,69403,69431,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've gone back and forth on the fail-fast vs. go-deep approaches.  After working at my first startup, I leaned towards the go-deep approach, because they went through 4 business plans in the year I was there, and if they had concentrated on #2 (they were literally a week or two away from having paying customers), they might have had cash to survive #3 and 4.  <p>Then when I was graduating from college, the fail-fast approach started making more sense, because people were making tens of millions on really simple startup ideas like del.icio.us, Flickr, and Reddit.  These succeeded because they happened to hit the right niche, because they had supercool, detailed technology.  Nowadays, I'm leaning back towards depth, which sucks for us, because our idea is a fairly shallow fill-a-quick-need idea and my cofounder is more into the fail-fast hit-the-lotto approach.  <p>My two years in financial software has kinda rubbed off on me: I think that the real optimal strategy is to do whatever everybody else is not doing.  So startup #1 failed  because it was flitting between ideas on the eve of the dot-com bust, when everyone else was doing the same thing.  Flickr, del.icio.us, etc. did well because they were founded right at the tail end of the dot-com bust, when the recession had killed off everyone else going after the easy pickings and left a lot of untapped niches.  Now may be the time to go deep, because there are a zillion Web 2.0 folks picking off every single social networking idea, every AJAXified calendar, etc.",1192674804

For some reasons, I feel that I need to defend John because I think the article is unfair and dare I say, perhaps even hitting below the belt.  I knew John in late-2002 when we were both between startups.  John is a visionary and has what it takes to go from nothing to something.  With all the money going into web 2.0 startups, this is bound to happen.  It reminds me of what many of us went through in the 1999/2000 with the telecom bubble and the trouble we had with VC money.  Good luck, John.  I am convinced that you will rise again.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p>How to Turn Your VC into Your Worst Enemy?

It was another 2 years before I saved enough to buy my first car. ($1500).  I still have my //c and have booted  it up occasionally.  About 4 years ago I bartered some computer parts to someone in exchange for him making image files of all my disks.  They run great on an Apple emulator.

The fact you are able to go out on a limb and try to create something from nothing shows you're already on the right path.<p>I remember pg saying somewhere that a lot of making a successful startup is skill, but another large part is luck. If you keep putting yourself out there, you might fail, but each time you get to that point, you increase your chances of getting lucky greatly. As long as you can take something away from each try you really didn't lose anything except a little time.",1192673221

If your company repeatedly violates these, it's probably time to move on.<p>Recently at the startup I work for, we were doing a big push for launch (80 hour weeks, etc).  One night I finally hit a brick wall and just couldn't be there anymore, like when you're just sitting there looking at the screen not able to work.  My PM was being slightly a dick and not hearing me on this, so Office Space style I snuck out the back and just left.  The team even had a conversation about whether they should fire me over this infraction, as if I'm their 90-hour a week wage slave.<p>Another guy stuck it out, but resented the company so much for it that he quit a few days later and wrote a scathing letter to the all hands list / posted it on his blog.  Point being, don't let anyone push you around.<p>And if you're a little savvy with clients / marketing yourself, just know that you can always make 2x as much as a full-time job by contracting, where in theory you should have more control over stress, schedule, etc.  (ability to choose decent clients / fire sucky ones, etc)",1192673089

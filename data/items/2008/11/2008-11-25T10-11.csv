Alchemy compiled code utilizes new bytecodes added to FP10 for working with ByteArrays - which as you’ll remember are what make up the ""RAM"" in Alchemy. Function calls are faster because in ActionScript function calls require that their parameters be ""boxed"" and ""unboxed"" into and out of objects for each call. Alchemy code doesn’t have to do this.",1227608677

I was wrong about homosexuality in animals, thanks.<p><i>that's one set of cousins you don't have to compete with for food and attention</i><p>In all situations except extreme crisis, having cousins is good for your inclusive genetic fitness because your cousins share a lot of your genes. That's why instinct generally tells us to help cousins, not compete with them. So having a gay uncle is bad for you, sorry :-)<p><i>I'm against the taxes that marriage provides breaks from.</i><p>Of course I'd agree to allow gay marriage if we abolish taxes at the same time - no argument here.",1227607449

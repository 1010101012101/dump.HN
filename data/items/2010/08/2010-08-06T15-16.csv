According to the detailed report, these access rights included the ability to access servers containing SCADA system information. The report was not encrypted or password-protected in any way. Anyone with access to the leaked document and a copy of Microsoft Word could read the report in full.<p>The file was inadvertently distributed on USB keys provided to some attendees.<p>I guess the lesson here is that, as a service provider, you must take every absolutely every precaution to safeguard customer data.<p>As a purchaser of pentest services, you should make sure that you contractually require your pentest vendor to take any necessary precautions to safeguard whatever reports and data they might retain. If you need boilerplate terms and services contract language, please contact me via email or at @sharpesecurity on Twitter. If there is enough demand, I may post the sample contract language online.<p>A sanitized version of the steps used to compromise the target are available at http://sharpesecurity.blogspot.com/2010/07/major-oil-company-data-leaked-by.html.<p>blog: sharpesecurity.blogspot.com

Why have a graph library when you can just embed the graph naturally in the data? When I wear my Java hat I search for libraries to do what I want. When I wear my lisp hat I simply do what I need. I can't remember when I needed a ""library"".  So, to a lisper, libraries have the flavor of crutches. Having a large
set of libraries (crutches) is not a feature.</i><p>I suppose this makes sense for a guy with his resume:  lots of AI and mathematical programming.  However, this attitude makes no sense when you're trying to write a rich application with iteration after iteration of adding trivial but laborious features.  When you want to add user preferences to a GUI app, you need a dialog box, a backing store, plus all kinds of bells and whistles like an easy way to add validation and tooltips to the preference values, some kind of encryption for passwords, etc.  Of course the ideal case is for all this stuff to be written in Lisp and for your application to be written in Lisp, but if the Lisp ethic continues to be ""we don't need no stinking libraries,"" then frameworks written in brain-dead languages like Java will continue to predominate, and we will just have to be happy if there's a Lispy language that integrates well enough to use the framework.

As Zmei says [SLang] a GS only language, which even within GS is not exactly universally loved. I hear tales of tragically poor performance, and the inability to cope with modern programming. Think of it as a equivalent to C# 1.0, ie old fashioned.<p>I don't know how much it is seen as protecting IP, but it is not clear how GS can give it up within the next decade even if they tried. There is just so much of it there.<p>There are spots of Java, VBA, and C++ in GS, who often value C++ experience in new hires, even if they don't use it.<p>The GS IT bonus pool is better than most people's IT bonus pool, but it's several tiers down.
Mobility is no worse at GS than many other firms, but that is not saying much of course.
Slang does in this context work to your advantage. Many IT department technologies have no value in quant and/or front office roles, but since Slang is prevalent in all aspects of GS, this barrier is much smaller.
But of course the politics in all banks is far more of a problem than the technology.""<p>Dominic is a very well known Quant head hunter. Well informed and generally well liked within the community. I'd wager that they don't want to use Slang in the spinoff simply because they have a change to do a reset and don't want the baggage.",1281107655

It is an English word with no existing actual referent, like the phrase ""uniform distribution over the real number line"". No such thing.<p>One of the fun things about learning about machine learning is that you get a great and powerful definition of bias, and as a consequence it can clearly explain that what unbiased translates to is ""brings <i>no</i> information about the possible set of experiences to the table"", but the consequence of that is that it takes an infinite amount of information to come to any conclusions whatsoever, even probabilistic ones. No matter how finitely many bits you apply to your original N-dimensional infinite state space, you still have an infinite state space remaining.<p>And in my experience, the ML definition of ""bias"" isn't just a cute mathematical construct, it actually has a direct (and somewhat profound) relationship to the word as used in English, so while I used math terminology in the previous paragraph this is not a case where theory and practice diverge. They are actually quite convergent here, and there really is no such thing as ""unbiased"".",1281107010

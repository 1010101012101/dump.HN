This means that no garbage collection is needed: the storage associated with a variable is freed when the variable goes out of scope, or when the variables value is set to <i>null</i> (and yes, you must have a value of type Optional T in order to set it to null). I thought that having pure value-semantics would be too costly in a language, but apparently that kind of solution has its place after all.",1415483959

8578253,comment,8577211,8577211,0,0,MCRed,,,"I don&#x27;t see much controversial here.  Apple&#x27;s practice has long been to underwrite capital equipment for their suppliers, so that the supplier can afford to manufacture the item that Apple needs.  This makes sense because the supplier is the one with the expertise to make the product.  For instance, when the machining for the iPhone 4 case was not producible with current equipment, only equipment designed for making prototypes, Apple bought 1,000 of these very expensive machines for Foxconn.<p>Apple is not a sapphire manufacturer, but GT is, and this afforded GT the opportunity to go into this business with minimal capital risk.  GT has expertise that Apple does not.<p>It sounds like GT thought the new process was ready for production and all they needed was the furnaces and plant, and then they failed to bring the plant on line and produce what was needed.... and is now blaming Apple for it.<p>Since Apple provided the money to build the plant, an exclusivity agreement doesn&#x27;t seem &quot;onerous&quot; in the least.  The &quot;below market&quot; prices allegation also seems appropriate-- given that GT purported to have a new technology that changed the economics making sapphire viable for new uses.  The main challenge with sapphire is that it is expensive, and hard to make large pieces-- such as you would need for the front display of an iPhone.<p>The idea that Apple wielded &quot;all the leverage&quot; is silly. GT could simply walk way.  There is no leverage in the case when the other party is not beholden or forced to do business with you.  If GT had such a killer new process as to make phone faces at reasonable prices, then they could have gone to Motorola, Samsung or other potential customers.  How does Apple have all the leverage when there&#x27;s no requirement for GT to sign the deal?<p>It really sounds like this company bit off more than it could chew, couldn&#x27;t meet the obligations it agreed to, and is now having sour grapes.",1415483419

And I agree that a lot of people who want to upgrade after 5 years probably will just want a new machine. But the soldering of parts still sucks, and even if it&#x27;s got a small impact, it goes against some of the principles I think we should be cautious with to throw out. Don&#x27;t want to get into a big slippery slope argument here but for a manufacturer to act as if soldering parts is imperative and unavoidable to me has a high burden of proof.

8578231,comment,8576629,8577734,0,0,tzs,,,"The main point of ITN is that it is very low energy, at a cost of being slow. You wouldn&#x27;t use it for manned missions. You&#x27;d use it for unmanned missions, including cargo transport to support manned missions.<p>For instance, suppose you have established a mining and manufacturing operation on the Moon, and want to start a long term project to establish a permanent Mars base. You can start out by putting together a bunch of supplies that Mars base will need, launching that supply package into the Earth&#x27;s  orbit, moving it to an appropriate Earth/Sun Lagrange point, and then nudging it into an unstable orbit that intercepts an unstable orbit around a Mars/Sun Lagrange point. When the package reaches that point, another nudge transfers it to that second unstable orbit, where it eventually reaches a Mars/Sun Lagrange point, from which it can move to Mars.<p>The only step in that trip that uses a lot of energy is the launch to get away from the Moon. All the rest of the maneuvers (moving to/from Lagrange points, entering and exiting the unstable orbits, and switching between the unstable orbits) take very little energy.<p>It would take a while to get there...I don&#x27;t recall for sure, but I think it is something around 3 years.<p>You make the first package large, with enough supplies to support a Mars base for 6 months or more. Then every 3 months you launch another package.<p>When the first package arrives successfully at Mars, and the other packages in the pipeline are in good shape, you launch your manned mission to actually establish the base.<p>Note that the manned mission only needs to carry enough food, air, and water for the trip itself. Same goes for fuel--it only needs enough fuel to get to Mars. Fuel and supplies for a return trip can be included in the supply packages coming in on the ITN.<p>(You can do this starting from the Earth instead of the Moon, of course, but it takes a lot less energy to get from the Moon to an Earth/Sun Lagrange point than from the Earth, so it is probably worth getting mining and manufacturing set up on the Moon first and then making that the starting point for establishing bases elsewhere).",1415482892

Eventually they had me do server-side work. And then CI/CD and operations. I really did not enjoy doing the CI/CD/ops work so I complained that I wanted to do more development. Management didn&#x27;t listen so I quit my job and joined as a front-end developer for a different company.<p>Several months later, I&#x27;m doing ops work and there&#x27;s talk of assigning CI/CD work to me. I&#x27;m pretty frustrated by this.<p>This time I&#x27;m planning to make it clear to management that if I continue to be assigned this kind of work, that I&#x27;m going to leave. Do you have any advice on how I should proceed?",1415482640

I would really consider just contacting Seattle recruiting firms directly, you might just not be visible to them because you don&#x27;t have any us linked in connections.  What are your skills?<p>I&#x27;m really surprised that Vancouver is so low, since your just a relatively instant TN visa away to Seattle a 2hr drive away.  The only people who would be &#x27;stuck&#x27; there are non-canadian immigrants, and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s relatively low.<p>Oh yeah, at the border, only say your job description to them when they ask.  So if your TN visa letter says &#x27;software engineer&#x27;, do not say &#x27;software developer&#x27;. Your job description to the border people is only what is officially allowed for your job category in a TN visa too.  Make sure the employer&#x27;s letter is done properly by a lawyer.<p>The basic process is:<p>1. Get an email invite for an interview<p>2. Print out this email and tell the border people your only going for an interview and they&#x27;ll do the proper TN paperwork in the country afterwards while you wait in Canada<p>3. They should mail/email you the TN offer letter, tell how the process works if they decide to hire you.<p>4. You go to the border with the TN visa letter, you tell the border people your applying for the TN status/visa.  You&#x27;ll walk into the office, they&#x27;ll review it, might make you do a bunch of shit and answer questions and if they accept they&#x27;ll stamp your passport with the TN status.<p>5.

It&#x27;s pretty evident that arguments for restraint for reasons of long-term sustainability take a lot of effort to get any traction, especially when fighting profitability.<p>All this to say, the GMO debate, like everything in life, is not as simple as most people tend believe. It is something that should be proceeded with caution, but certainly continued. This I think is where I think the almost religious anti-GMO fervor really causes harm, in the same way anti embryonic stem cell research causes harm.<p>Move fast and break things is a great slogan when the systems you&#x27;re moving are relatively simple and the consequences of breaking them are relatively minor. Global ecology is an extraordinarily complex system that we don&#x27;t fully understand, and breaking it can cause real and life threatening damage to the people of the world.

Programmers and developers relied on that ruling for the proposition that APIs, like the menu hierarchy in Lotus, may not be copyrighted under § 102(b).

(Or haven&#x27;t been prior to this case? I think some worry that if the logic of this case if carried through, many things that were previously not protected by copyright will become so).<p>Let&#x27;s say you figure out, say, a great new way to assemble some tool, and write down instructions for it (1. Get a ball of twine. 2. Get some chewing gum. 3. Affix the chewing gum to twine.)<p>Your instruction booklet itself is copyrightble -- nobody can photocopy it without your permission. But the <i>steps you figured out</i> are not copyrightable, someone else can write down those steps in their own words, hey, look what we can do with chewing gum and twine, and that is not protected by copyright.  You can&#x27;t stop someone from sharing those steps with others in their own words, and you can&#x27;t stop someone from carrying out those steps. (Under copyright, that is. The steps <i>may</i> be patentable; that&#x27;s a different law. But they are not copyrightable. Or... didn&#x27;t used to be?).<p>That&#x27;s the way copyright has been. It seems to many that the API itself, and the ability to make new software with the same API, is more like &quot;following the steps yourself in your own words&quot;, than it is like the &quot;instruction booklet.&quot;  If someone writes docs for their API with lots of good narrative instructions and examples -- nobody else can just copy that documentation (&quot;instruction booklet&quot;) wholesale, that&#x27;s protected by their copyright, nobody disputes that. But the classes, methods, and signatures themselves, prior to this case, most everyone thought were more like &quot;steps themselves&quot; and not subject to copyright.<p>An &quot;an understanding between people&quot; has in fact never been copyrightable in itself, you can&#x27;t stop someone else from sharing the same understanding, under copryight.

Skepticism goes off the rails when the S gets capitalized and it tries to style itself as a Movement(tm).<p>It can never be a movement or a belief system because... it isn&#x27;t. Skepticism is a practice of question-asking and open-minded interrogation, not a specific set of beliefs. Saying you&#x27;re skeptical says nothing about what you actually think.<p>Secondly, when it tries to style itself as a Movement it starts taking on many of the characteristics of the religious ideologies is styles itself against.

But also: the modern nation-state is, in many ways, founded on the notion of maps. A nation exists not just by itself but instead of and in place of other government. So it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to assume public maps come from a time where e.g. the western border of the country was fuzzy and who controlled what was information of great importance. For instance, if it&#x27;s 1823 and I&#x27;m looking to farmstead, a map both legitimizes, in some way, American rule, and delineates reality about Comanche raids (which were not something you&#x27;d want to bump into).<p>I generally like open government, but I think this particular practice may come from a history where maps were more interesting and relevant to the integrity of the nation-state.",1415480893

The services they provide are all isolated, and you are authenticated entirely separately to each one. This means that You can sign up for a driving licence, and you can sign up for a passport, but neither the DVLA (/DMV) or the Passport office know that you have done the other thing. There is no central database of user details. There was a huge backlash several years ago against national ID cards for this reason, and the Verify system was designed specifically to make this impossible.<p>It&#x27;s very like OAuth in some respects. Just because I have signed in to two services with Twitter, does not mean that one of those services can access the other in my name. In the same way, if banks used Verify for authentication, the government wouldn&#x27;t know, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything even if they did.<p>I&#x27;ve had the system explained to me before by GDS engineers, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s a wonderful piece of engineering, and in some ways, an amazing piece of policy.",1415480885

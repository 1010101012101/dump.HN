I've been looking for this statement and haven't found it. When Googlers are directly asked, they pointedly don't answer or say they don't know.<p>Amit Singhal's statement was carefully worded to be ambiguous on this matter, and Google has apparently confirmed that page-load-time data (at the very least) from the Toolbar <i>does</i> affect rankings.<p>Such use by search is definitely allowed by Google's written privacy policy. The confirm dialog a user passes when installing the Toolbar refers to that privacy policy.<p>It'd be very easy for an official Google spokesperson to say clearly that Toolbar data doesn't drive search rankings, if that were true. That they haven't strongly suggests it is used.<p>Search expert Danny Sullivan made the same observation in his 'Bing: Why Google’s Wrong In Its Accusations' article:<p><i>As For The Google Toolbar<p>Meanwhile, I’m on my third day of waiting to hear back from Google about just what exactly it does with its own toolbar. Now that the company has fired off accusations against Bing about data collection, Google loses the right to stay as tight-lipped as it has been in the past about how the toolbar may be used in search results.<p>Google’s initial denial that it has never used toolbar data “to put any results on Google’s results pages” immediately took a blow given that site speed measurements done by the toolbar DO play a role in this. So what else might the toolbar do?</i><p><a href=""http://searchengineland.com/bing-why-googles-wrong-in-its-accusations-63279"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/bing-why-googles-wrong-in-its-ac...</a>",1296943167

So in the 4 year course, the 3rd year is work experience.<p>I did that, which was fantastic experience (good coworkers, nice codebase to work with and an interesting industry) and led to me being employed by the same company upon leaving University. While interviewing for my next job, it was often mentioned that I had 18 months more experience than others in my position (recent-ish graduate), and they valued that much more highly than they would one additional year of in-University education.<p>As for getting a job without a educational backing, it's all about proving yourself. I have a friend who's co-worker had never been formally educated, but was a senior developer at the firm. He had a solid portfolio and ran his own small web development effort on the side.

2184202,comment,2183480,2184080,0,0,haberman,,,"A search engine performs the task of narrowing 1 trillion URLs into the 10 that are most likely to be what you are looking for.  Associating a query with those 10 results takes teams of software engineers and datacenters full of computers.  A user could not reasonably do this on their own.<p>Contact data is a list of the people you know.  I had that list in my brain before I ever visited Facebook.  If I am on different social networking sites, that list is mostly the same, because it is information about <i>me</i> that I already knew.  I didn't come to Facebook saying ""hey Facebook, find for me the 10 people in the world who would be the best possible friends for me.""  Instead, I come to Facebook and start telling <i>them</i> the names of my friends.<p>But forget all that for a second.  Imagine that contact data and search engines really were the same thing.  Google does not access Facebook's social graph, because Facebook has not allowed them to.  For Google's behavior to be like Microsoft's Google would have to work around that by using the ""clickstream"" of Chrome users who are on Facebook.  Who knows, maybe Microsoft is doing this already, since they seem to think that ""clickstream"" is a valid way to mine the internal databases of other companies.",1296942896

Social networks themselves were almost brand new, and the idea of creating a distributed, open source one was almost unheard of.  The nearest project (DiSo) didn't show up for two years after that.<p>Also, my intention quickly became more than just a social networking app, and I really wanted to turn it into a framework for social apps.  So that brought up all kinds of issues of MVC framework design and how to build an API and other large architectural issues.<p>Not to mention that a lot of the project I've had to do myself, with both very little precedence, and very little help (comparatively).  Some of that was my fault, for not being better at documentation and project management, but I also learned that soliciting help for open source projects is a lot harder than The Cathedral and The Bazaar made it out to be.<p>It's easier now, that the groundwork has been set, and there are competing projects I can look at and learn from, but the first few years of flying blind was a hell of a crash course.",1296942324

I would definitely spend some more time to look into the applicant.<p>Yes, for pure coders, this is a terrible resume. It looks like she is using the right side of the brain for something left-sided. But, that's the point.<p>How many coders do you know can show an interest in both design and code (same for designers)? To have an aptitude and interest in both code and design is something very hard to find, and to be able to express the fusion of the two is a challenging process for many who are aching to stretch the boundary set by text heavy, information-only resumes that do not communicate nearly what you want it to.

These diseases no longer kill millions and maim millions more.</i><p>I'll just leave this here:<p><a href=""http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html</a><p>I've seen similar graphs over the years, basically arguing that these diseases were in long-term decline before the introduction of their respective vaccines, and that the vaccines merely sealed the deal.<p>Were I more ambitious, I'd seek out the source data from official sources, and confirm or refute the analysis myself.<p>This paper appears to have asked the same questions:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9088445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9088445</a><p>It came to the following conclusion:<p><i>Historical data provide evidence of proof of efficacy of mass immunization for measles, polio, rubella, mumps, and pertussis, but not for diphtheria or tetanus.</i><p>This does not contradict the claim that the incidence of said diseases were already in significant decline prior to the introduction of immunizations, or that immunizations were not necessary for eradication.<p>It seems like a rather obvious analysis to do: compare the maximum historic incidence of said disease, the incidence at the time of vaccine introduction, and the rates of decline prior to and following said introduction. It should be fairly easy to argue from that whether a) the vaccine contributed to eradication, and b) the vaccine was necessary for eradication.",1296939975

Why is the graphic laid out so that the cutesy venn diagram looks like a color key?<p>* Spends something like 1/3 of the real estate of the graphic on an almost entirely uninteresting attribute of the candidate (what terminal she uses, what text editor she uses, what browsers [seriously.] she uses). Designers can be expected to know Photoshop. Nobody cares about your editor.<p>* I have no idea what the subway-map illustration of command line tools and web services even means; the impression I get is, ""this person will add baffling complexity to things in order to avoid boredom"". Whoah, where do I sign?<p>* Extraordinarily inefficient representation of the candidate's Rails experience; a simple resume would lead with ""Rails developer with over 5 years experience"" instead of burying the lede in another cutesy picture.<p>* No reasonable employer cares about college credits earned in high school, the age you were when you coded your first website, or what platforms you tech-supported in school, and yet that material consumes <i>more visual weight</i> than the number of years the candidate has doing Rails development.<p>Resume tip. Here is the terrible thing about spending time on your resume pointing out your favorite dog breed or color-coding your choice of text editors: people with real accomplishments would <i>never, ever do that</i>, because they only have two pages of heavily-bulleted text to convey those accomplishments in. What you say with a resume like this is, ""I hope someday to have major accomplishments"" --- whether that's true or not.<p>It's not just that infographics are a crappy format for resumes (and, <i>they simply are.</i>). It's that this is not a good infographic. In fact, since we're all so familiar with resumes here, it's actually a really good example of the problem with all the cheesy infographics that have been floating around for the past year.<p>The blogger who highlighted this ""graphical resume"" did a disservice to the person who created it; I have no doubt the author is an totally reasonable human being who sends normal resumes to people when resumes are what's called for.",1296939966

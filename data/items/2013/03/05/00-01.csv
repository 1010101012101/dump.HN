5322152,comment,5317886,5321347,2,0,klodolph,,,"> If the cheaper lenses on DLSRs aren't able to really give enough quality to fully take advantage of higher MP, I'm not quite sure why you'd think that the ones on a compact would be.<p>You might be surprised at the quality of some of the P&S lenses.  There have been excellent lenses on cheap fixed-lens P&S cameras for decades: a modern example is the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100, an older example is the Yahsica Electro series from the 1960s.  From resolution tests you can find modern P&S  cameras with soft lenses and you can also find ones with real, honest 10+ MP resolutions.  You don't need to trust my math, you can go check out test shots online.<p>> As you say yourself ""You must not open the lens fully"", in which case the f/3.9 is irrelevant.<p>I also wasn't really explaining things fully with the maxim.  Opening the lens reduces diffraction and increases aberrations.  A few good lenses will open all the way to, say, f/2 and still get sharper as you open them up.  Some terrible lenses aren't sharp at f/8.  However, the trade-off is different at different system sizes.  For a P&S, wide open might be the best way to go.  For MF and LF, you'll probably want f/11 or f/22 to start with, as ridiculous as that sounds.  Of course, this assumes you want maximum resolution.",1362444901

5322143,comment,5321327,5322000,3,0,TheLegace,,,"Ugh, I have hated Methylphenidate, it was really close to ruining my life. It made me feel angry and depressed. I hated the world and every single moment after taking it for some time. Even off of it I felt it semi-permanently affected my brain.<p>I gave Adderral a shot, but again it is quite an unstable drug. Mostly because of it's a Dopamine Uptake Inhibitor. And that usually causes unstable Dopamine levels, meaning less stable mood and thinking.<p>I fortunately found a Doctor that prescribed new age of ADHD medication. Although it is not for the weary. Atomoxetine(Strattera) is much more stable, and much more powerful drug. It doesn't have tolerance issues like typical drugs. It is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it enhances the neurotransmitter that's a precursor to all other neurotransmitters including Dopamine. This means all your neurotransmitters become enhanced.<p>Now I say it's a drug not for weary minded, because it's actually very hard to adjust to it. For the first month you have to take 20mg increments every week to get your body to adjust to it. At first it makes your incredibly sleepy(can't even stay awake at any time), but that quickly fades and your realize that sleep is much easier to schedule when you can get the brain to feel sleepy(Needed for someone with ADHD).<p>It also is tough on your liver, unless you eat a decent sized meal you will most definitely vomit bile from your Liver(I know I have seen it enough). It gives your incredible nausea and will eliminate your appetite to the point where it hurts to eat.<p>I have found that combining it with Marijuanna to be advantageous. Both drugs complement each other(one to counteract nausea and trigger hunger, the other to enhance the high you get.<p>It's one of those drugs that doesn't make your ADHD disappear, but let you take control of it. But it really is miles ahead of anything, and has changed my life completely. I have been using it for a year, and the flood gates are off. Unfortunately I still struggle with a lot of things, but now I have the ability to correct those learning weakness because I can concentrate.",1362444770

This is what I can say about my experience.<p>I took methylphenidate in two forms, a short acting tablet that lasted for a ~4 hours and a proprietary time release capsule called Concerta that lasted for ~9 hours.\nAs a kid, for the first few years taking it there was a massive difference between me under it's effects and me without it. I totally remember feeling like I could focus on anything I wanted and completely block out everything else. Also, I remember my appetite being hugely affected, where I could ignore eating for quite a while and not really feel affected.<p>However, as time passed, I noticed two things:<p>1. The medication didn't affect me as much as it used to.<p>2. When off the medication, I wasn't as distracted.<p>In fact, by the time senior year rolled around, I could tell when I was under the effects of the medication, but not by a huge amount.<p>This August, after a recommendation from my doctor, I switched to Vyvanse instead of Concerta as my long-acting medication. For me, this has actually been very good. It's a much ""gentler"" effect than what I remember Concerta being like, in that I don't feel like the guy in ""Limitless"". I feel much more like my ""normal"" self but with my mind just slightly more organized.

I think that some of the confusion & criticisms I see in other comments are that after reading your pieces we all rush off to try adioso and some observations predominate:<p># The ui is quirky on different screen sizes\n# The calls to Expedia are SLOW\n# The natural language search is perhaps only one search interface and not necessarily the best\n# The core bit you guys have worked on 'wingtip' is sort of lost in this version of Adioso because of trying to increase coverage\n# You could have utilised existing api's like ITA's QPX, Everbread's Haystack, Amadeus, even Skyscanner's api and increased coverage whilst being much faster. \n# The example link at the end that presumably is the answer to the question ""For the first time, were seeing signs that the flight data we need is becoming available, in the right format"" is totally misleading. Vayant are an ITA competitor not a raw data provider. They have managed to achieve in their price cacheing tech what you have only achieved for lots of low cost carriers.\n# And this last point is my biggest confusion about Adioso and what I think is your internal confusion. Are you a tech platform for flight data or a consumer facing flight website. Because Kayak, Hipmunk (and previously Orbitz erc) are B2C consumer sites that get data from ITA, Amadeus etc. Vayant, ITA etc are B2B data platforms - tech companies. Only skyscanner truly is both I think. They are a B2C site that last year enabled the selling of over 2 Billion worth of tickets but which is powered by its own 'Graphite' Graph and price cacheing databases.<p>The embarrassment I feel for you is when you say that you are making a travel site 'even when it's impossible'. I cringe for you! You haven't built a site even as good as Skyscanner's and you're saying pretentious statements like that? I know startups are hard and this is for a book so poetic license is to be expected.<p>I say ditch the BS and get back to reality. You could attach your natural language interface to someone else's api (like Vayant's) and have a better B2C product or keep improving 'wingtip' but this all seems like a confused desperate fudge.<p>Incidentally, when are you going to talk in detail about 'Wingtip' it's the bit that most interests me. It IS Adioso. I really do wish you guys every success though. What you are doing is needed but ditch the slow ass Expedia api.",1362444344

I believe the article was slated not for the current UNIX practitioners at the time but for communicating with NT administrators hence not following the concept where less external calls produces faster script execution; the referenced issue would have been `grep shrimp < menu` whereas the the redirection is optional as it's default.<p>None the less to be informative as the others which have responded I would like to expand on the concept as it's a logical pattern which is still passed down in explaining computational models and simply creating better development and scalable software where an interpreter is used.<p>Much like the current culture considers DRY( Don't Repeat Yourself) as a refactoring step to get their code to be the most bug free; fastest while being in form of a readable one-liner is much the same we do as stating ""filter early and filter often"".<p>Lighter weight tokens provide faster execution( i.e. use the utility command cut in place of the general purpose pipeline language awk; refactor to avoid unneeded call to xargs, and of course use cat only when it is useful such as testing heredocs prior to embedding the generator to log, mail, filesystem or network).<p>From my observations many people first begin to learn to use pipes with grep. First explanation is almost always to explore interactively the `cat file | grep pattern`. It's a poor pedagogy simply because it causes bad habits from the beginning.<p>We live in a autodidact world presently which is a good thing but the information on occasion seems to be diluted with a self starter which misinforms and creates a cancer growing within other sort of ""what I learned on my OSX about this ancient UNIX thing"" style posts.<p>We can't all have been lucky to read or learn from the philosophies of Kernighan, McIlroy et al.

I can easily forgo taking it for weeks, and do so. These ""vacations"" without it were advised by my doctor to prevent tolerance buildup, and I suspect to diminish the potential for addiction. My dosage has remained constant and I don't feel a ""need"" for it, so I guess they work. For many of those with ADHD the drug makes a world of difference, and pushes focus and tendency to move around into the ""normal"" range. For certain activities the (benefits - costs) equation works out, while for others it does not (which is to say certain activities don't appreciably benefit from the quiet mind--the costs are long term and are more difficult to discern). It's about planning to take it for days where it does help, and being mindful of the health ramifications (staying hydrated, eating normal and healthy meals, monitoring cardiac health with support from a doctor, continuing to consult the doctor, etc.).<p>My biggest fear beyond addiction is that it will be detrimental to my memory and learning in the long term. It's difficult to know if that is true.<p>The author clearly abused it. Taking it ""to socialize"" seems weird to me. I suspect the author did not need it in the first place, and was already in the ""normal"" range. My mentally disorganized self is much more outgoing that the focused version of me. If it is impacting sleep, the dosage is probably too high or too extended (though many MDs prescribe the XR version since ostensibly it has less potential for abuse).<p>Some of the alternative pharmaceuticals may work about as well, but Adderall has been around for so long that its risks are fairly well understood--though less so with long term use.<p>Vyvanse is a means to extract more money from patients via patent protection. It's essentially dexedrine with a lysine attached (new side group=new patent). The lysine gets cleaved <i>in vivo</i>, and it becomes dextroamphetamine. Adderall is a mixture of dextro- and levo- handed salts, so it's a bit more nuanced.<p>Taking it without doctor supervision is a major risk, and taking more than is prescribed or mixing it with other drugs as the author did compounds the risk.

The problem is that no one has yet figured out how to hedge the bet, attempt to solve extremely risky borderline impossible problems, and guarantee a profit. It's much <i>much</i> safer to go after an obvious, well-described, minor problem that over 50% of the population experiences and would pay a minor sum to improve. It's a safe bet. And there are a lot of those!<p>The other problem is surely capital and education. They've diverged and are being pulled in opposite directions. Higher education <i>saddles you with debt</i> and makes you <i>extremely risk averse.</i> You can't ever get access to capital because you're always playing it safe. So the system has been inadvertently designed to lock out these ""big problem"" jobs, because, again, they are too risky for people to undertake.<p>And then the rich are also risk-averse these days. The focus is on ROI and increasing wealthlook at Warren Buffet, one of the world's richest men, entirely rewarded for being risk-averse and investing in solid, tried-and-true companies. And you're surprised that the big problems aren't being solved? People like Buffet aren't investing in them, at least not at a large scale. And they're rewarded for that behavior. The system is set up to reward this sort of behavior. The idea is that once you get rich, you invest ""prudently"" and grow your wealth. You don't bet it all on the big problem that's probably impossible.<p>Except sometimes you do. Some people are solving the big problems. Elon Musk is up there doing it (in space and on the ground). Bill Gates and Buffet too are putting up a lot to fight seemingly impossible big health problems. This is all excellent, and not to be ignored.<p>I think the incentives are not yet aligned correctly to get the result you're looking for. What you want is to reward risk taking, and capitalism just doesn't do that in the right way. There are too many hurdles, too many punishments for failure. And the right people to solve the problems aren't the same ones who have the capital to get the solving done, for so many reasons.<p>There's your big problem to solvefix that system. Align the incentives. It's the meta-problem, and if you solved that, the world would probably be a better place.

We solved the data issue, very painfully, over a 10-year period, by working directly with the airlines. (This was, in fact, one of my major contributions to the company as COO, and many people were involved.) Using QPX, you could implement exactly what you envision with stuff ITA already has running.<p>I'm a cofounder of ITA but am no longer affiliated with the company. But if you want to talk to people there, I can connect you. Just reply here with some way for me to contact you.",1362441694

5321912,comment,5321603,5321603,0,0,winkerVSbecks,,,"Really beautiful design. However, I'm not really sure what this is trying to be. Is it a fork of Bootstrap or do they see themselves as a separate entity. Because if this is indeed a fork of Bootstrap I do have a few grievances:<p>- Why are there no fixed to top navbars? \n- What about lists or stacked navs?\n- I don't see any responsive behaviour\n- It seems to be missing almost all of js from Bootstrap and doesn't have equivalent implementations in most cases.\n- Hover based dropdown menu is a bit irritating, much rather have click based events. But that's a personal preference.<p>On the whole it's beautifully designed but it's missing so much in comparison to Bootstrap that it becomes useless for building apps.<p>Also, maybe mention Bootstrap somewhere on the page.",1362441610

4951995,comment,4949103,4949512,5,0,001sky,,,"You seem to miss the point of Silver's conflict of interest. He is a Modeler, and has a financial gain in promoting certain views. Among these are (1) the notions that modelers are in general ""experts""; and (2) that the intentions of people using the ""product"" of (1) are benign, or at any rate are not Opportunist. His PR agent would never let him say otherwise, it would be bad for business.<p>The financial crisis, at its heart was not an issue of ""mistaken models"". It was driven by (1) bad legislation from washington; and (2) unethical opportunism exploiting #1.<p>As a general rule, an Analyst at a Credit rating agency is a lowly position in wall street. Most important people (people acting of their own free will) disregard Rating Agency ""analysis"" out of hand. They do their own work. And people don't get promoted into Goldman Sachs, for example, from S&P et al very often. There is almosts a social stigma attached to the job, that would need to be cleansed with an MBA or some other ""success"" to pave the way. The people that cannot disregard rating agency work (due to law), of course are a built in market. And in general they are not on an even playing field with Wall Street with respect to their talent pool and access to information. So, bad analysis merely fills a vaccuum.<p>Using this as one example, think of the consequences.  First, the model/analysis of the rating agency is a ""product"" looking to be sold (like a used car). There are no buyers for even the best analysis (wall st does its own research). So the ""buyers"" are not wall street but people who are forced to rely on credit ratings by law (eg,  pension funds or some other public actors). But this is a captive market.  The goal of the rating agency then becomes to game the system by extending the market.  That is, creat new ""protected classes"" or create new ""Asset types"" that are salable to protected classes of investor.  Structurally, now, this is the ""game"". The models, data-sets, and actual implementaions are really beside the point, provided there is a lack of transparency (""black box"", proprietary, just complicated, etc).  The models will be reverse engineered to ""work"", they only need to be ""plasuble"" (as in plausible deniability).  Remember, the rating agencies are <<not legally experts>>. If they were, they could be sued,  They are just expressing their 1st amendment rights <<to have an opinion>>.<p>None of this you seem to address in your commentary.<p>Nate Silver is just one in a long line of ""experts"" looking for ways to ""sell their services"". The first step in doing this is to never undermine the notion of ""experts"", or the idea that the system is driven by ""expert knowledge"".  As the financial crisis has shown, those people who know what they are doing in the world are operating well beyond the scope and bounds of information that is available to people who publicly claim these hats.  There is a reason hedge funds are famously secretive.",1356078707

4951980,comment,4950671,4950671,2,0,bdash,,,"The majority of the other scrolling performance issues discussed in the article are things that browsers can and will improve over time. For instance, the version of WebKit used by Safari uses a combination of tiled rendering and multithreading to achieve smooth scrolling even when painting is expensive (such as on high-DPI devices where painting involves touching many more pixels). This multithreaded scrolling system was recently improved to support ""position: fixed"" elements, which means the benefit that the performance difference between ""fixed"" and ""absolute"" positioned elements that the article discusses is now nonexistent in Safari.<p>Pages that use scroll event handlers, however, place limits on what browsers can do to improve scrolling performance. Scroll events have to be interleaved with the painting that occurs during a scroll, otherwise any movement of onscreen elements that the event handler performs will appear out of sync with respect to the rest of the scrolling. The single threaded nature of JavaScript in web pages means that this event delivery requires bypassing the multithreading scrolling optimisation I mentioned above. Reducing, or preferably eleminating, these event handlers can result in dramatically smoother scrolling. Improvements to web technologies have been proposed in order to aid this. For instance, scroll events are often seen implementing headers that are in the flow of the page and then stick to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls downwards. ""position: sticky"", a means of achieving this effect without JavaScript, was recently proposed on the CSS standards mailing list [1] in order to help future developers unintentionally causing their pages to scroll in a jittery manner.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jun/0627.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jun/0627.h...</a>",1356078087

However that might be just because NLP course had much bigger and more tweakable tasks - on some algorithms, you could spend literally days to squeeze one last percent of accuracy out of it (and then end up overfitting, failing the hidden tests and having to start over again). NLP tasks weren't actually general programming tasks but more NLP-specific work - which is great, but it doesn't compare to generic Scala course. Scala tasks were much smaller and well-defined. I probably could use a bit more complex tasks, but being complete Scala novice before the course, I couldn't really - at least yet - do some heavy lifting with Scala as I could, say, with more familiar to me languages like Python or, say, C.",1356078061

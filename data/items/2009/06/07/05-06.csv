645638,comment,644699,644736,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"And that (the Humpty Dumpty reading, wherein the meaning and intent of words is subordinated to the reader's desire) is an assumption of the sort one has to make in order to ""prove"" that it is fundamentally impossible for a statement to be self-contradictory. Such statements are always introduced in intellectual discourse as self-referential; that is, the words ""this"", ""I"" and ""me"" are identities of the statement by definition. There is no ambiguity of the sort that one might find in Magritte's ""Ceci n'est pas une  pipe"", where one may chose to infer ""ceci"" to refer to any of the depiction of the pipe, the painting as a whole, or just the written statement (none of which is a pipe as such).<p>Think of it this way:<p>If a stranger were to approach you on the street, say, ""I am a liar,"" then walk away, you'd likely think that the fellow is a little depressed and perhaps a bit remorseful about a habit of lying whenever it suited him. If the same fellow, in the same circumstances, had instead said ""I am lying to you right now"" before wandering off, you're left with two choices -- seriously psychotic or smartass.<p>People are reluctant to think of systems such as language and mathematics as seriously psychotic, so a cottage industry has sprung up trying to prove that these systems are merely smartasses out to infect our internal source code repositories with Brainfuck or some other Turing tarpit. It doesn't matter how many times one invokes the demons of deconstructionism, these paradoxes are and will remain very real.",1244354182

I'm at a top ""name brand"" school for CS, and, honestly, when I look at myself next to someone from a good but less-well-known university (say, UW) who has done really interesting research, I feel inferior in a way.  I guess it has something to do with this guy really being a star in a pretty good department, versus myself being a pretty typical student in a very strong department.<p>What I'm trying to get at is that while being from MIT or Stanford makes a good first impression, personal achievements say a lot more about you than the hand you were dealt by the extremely noisy college admissions process (consider this:  I am a CS grad student at Stanford, and I was rejected from UMD and UMass Amherst for grad school).",1244353959

645624,comment,645362,645548,0,0,gizmo,,,"Interesting, I find that almost every comment section here on HN contains at least one useful piece of criticism (when there's criticism at all).<p>The difference may be that good criticism in my eyes doesn't need to be a complete analysis. Earlier today I dismissed an article by saying it had ""unsubstantiated claims"" and was ""sophomoric"". That was it. No additional details or explanations given. I still consider that good critical feedback, because a sufficiently motivated person could improve the work based on it.<p>If somebody looks at my code and says: ""that's too brittle"", that's good criticism. If somebody points at something and says: ""unpythonic"", that is good feedback too.<p>Other people are not obligated to tell you what you need to do to improve. Even when their dissatisfaction takes the form of a rant, there's often a rational cause underneath. (The cause may be completely unrelated to the work he's criticizing, but humans are funny that way.)<p>The difference between a critical analysis and bitching is only intent. Bitching is an attempt to make yourself feel better by making somebody else feel worse about his accomplishments. Criticism is trying to tell others where to improve.<p>So the exact same one-liner (e.g. ""that code sucks"") can be nasty bitching from one person, and good feedback if it comes from a respected peer.",1244353417

645622,comment,645388,645485,0,0,jstevens85,,,"Yes, Brits may put more focus on which university you go to, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.<p>In the UK, getting into Oxbridge is nowhere near as difficult as getting into Harvard, Yale, Princeton. There are 24,000 undergraduate spots at Oxbridge for 60 million Brits, compared to 17,000 spots at HYP for 300 million Americans.<p>Also, the application criteria at Oxbridge is far simpler. It is based entirely on academic potential. British universities are uninterested in extracurricular activities and ""well-roundedness"". In the US, very smart students with perfect grades are rejected from Harvard because they weren't editor of the school newspaper, because they got a D in History in 9th grade, or because they couldn't write a good essay about ""If you were going to sing a song in a talent show, what would you sing and why?"" That doesn't happen in the UK. If you are smart, work hard in school and get good grades, you'll get into Oxbridge. The same can't be said for getting into HYP.<p>All of the British universities are public, so there doesn't exist the situation where students may choose to go to Berkeley instead of UPenn because they want to save money, or because they were offered a scholarship.<p>Which university you attend in the UK tends to be a better indicator of intelligence and academic success than where you study in the US.",1244353343
645619,comment,645467,645547,0,0,endtime,,,">Not to mention the credentialism (a focus on credentials rather than actual ability)<p>Well, the idea is that credentials are a measure of actual ability.  A company looking for new hires can't give everyone a month-long trial to see what their ability is firsthand, so credentials like GPA and degree serve as a heuristic.  It's not a perfect system, and in some respects you could even call it broken...but until someone comes up with a better way for companies to work out who to interview, it's necessary.  Personally, I think it would be better to fix the problems than to remove the system entirely.",1244353197

For example, perhaps, after the barriers have been removed, a new school has popped up which has a better way of training doctors. They are allowed to teach in ways that were not allowed before. Doctors from this school go on to perform exceptionally well and have a proven track record. You hear about them from satisfied patients and ratings organizations (like Consumer Reports). Their medical procedures are insured by a company that also highly recommends them. You select one of them.<p>Or, perhaps you prefer some sort of alternative medicine. Using whatever criteria you choose, you are allowed to have a procedure done regardless of whether or not your doctor has a title. After all, the majority is wrong sometimes.",1244352969

Key budgeting authority devolved from cities and counties up to Sacramento, where they have to compete with the state government for money. You want your streets paved or more teachers for your third grade? Stand in line behind the health department, or the corrections department, or Caltrans.\n	And then the state borrows (takes?) the money it is supposed to send back to the cities and counties for it's own uses.\nCalifornia is not ungovernable -- it's just been ungoverned.",1244351853

The only thing IITs used to be good were, (in their early and mid years) to gather some good minds together and give them quite a bit of freedom and a nice environment (in the hostels and such) so that they can discuss their ideas, which they used to implement not while there in IIT, but after graduating.<p>However, in the recent years, the quality of these minds has become a bit questionable (this is purely anecdotal, no concrete proofs). One thing is for certain though, the amount of discussion which was there in years when each hostel room did not have its own computer was quite high, which now in the age of facebook and multiplayer games has reduced by a huge margin.

In many cases, Wikipedia is a good first source.<p>- Track down a few additional references.  These can be short survey articles, if necessary. Get a sense for the field.<p>- Find a discussion or discussions on the topic.  Follow these.  Unless your need is very pressing <i>sit on your hands for the first week or so</i> and see both what is being discussed and what cultural norms are.

If there's Google Glass between you and the person you are talking to, you have every reason to believe you are not receiving their full attention.

I think it's time you held a press conference.<p>In  any event, you are making my point with your blind adherence to scientific dogma. First, science doesn't offer ""no answer"", it offers that it knows the answer and that the answer is randomness. Huge difference and if you look at the OP, that is what is being claimed as if it's scientific fact. And, that is why I take exception. If science doesn't know yet, then fine.

And, I challenge you to prove otherwise.<p>In fact, I (and many respected scientists) believe that the randomness argument is actually far inferior in the face of empirical evidence.

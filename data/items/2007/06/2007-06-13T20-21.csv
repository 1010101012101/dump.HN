If you do it the expedient way you take a risk.<p>Anyway, I don't really have a point.  I prefer doing things right over doing things quickly (whether or not I'm writing missile guidance software).  Maybe that makes me a crappy programmer, but my results are always higher quality.<p>Suppose you're in the chair building business.  You really want your profits, so you hack together a quick design.  You sit in it, and hey, it holds up.  It's even sorta comfy!  So you build and sell them, and the customers generally like the chair too.  But after a year, they break, so they have to come back and buy another chair.  (Hey, this is sounding like a good idea, maybe I'm in the wrong business.)<p>Does this abstraction hold with software?  Possibly.  Shipping desktop software is a lot like shipping a chair, except upgrades are free.  The web takes that and ups the speed of updates by a factor of, say, a hundred.  So now we have the tantalizing possibility of shipping half-working software and 'fixing things as they become a problem'.  <p>That might be a good mantra to follow, or it might not..  Only you can decide.  I fight for quality over speed.  Yeah, we only have 70-some-odd years of solid craftsmanship left, but taking an extra few days to design something that works better won't cause you grief and will save you headaches.  <p>Shawn",1181768385
27885,comment,27846,27868,0,0,aresnick,,,"""is pretty surreal. . ."" --tell me about it =)  Frankly, I think it's too many features.  We've a prioritized development schedule based on user input, and I expect that we'll find that the site becomes what we want/need at around 1/3-1/2 of these features.<p>That's good to hear, about Django, given the prominence of user/session support in our plans.  Public site design is frankly a secondary concern: I think a template system will be more than enough.  But, I figured I'd throw it out there.<p>We've already rolled a simple CAD/drawing app via the  element, and I expect that to be more than sufficient.<p>Thanks a bunch for your input!  I'll be sure to be in contact as we proceed.",1181768148
27884,comment,27875,27875,0,0,tx,,,"Without automatic testing dynamic languages <i>are not</i> very productive because they do not catch type mismatch errors during compilation time (there isn't one). With statically typed languages you get a lot of tiny issues taken care of  once you hit magic ""compile"" button and compiler does some basic sanity checks.<p>Without solid unit tests backing you, activities like removing ""obsolete"" methods or renaming classes/modules turn into nightmare with duck typed languages.

Can I build an application on this platform that runs on it's own domain name and takes over 100% of browser real estate? (I am not being sarcastic, I am asking since I haven't spent much time drilling into it)

I use ajax/GETs to change server state, does this really matter?<p>inklesspen's objections to GETs changing server state seem to be based on web-accelerators following links.  If web accelerators do not parse js, then inklesspen's objections are not relevant.  Am I correct?",1181767544

It always feels great when the tests catch an introduced bug, but it is really worth the time you could be spending on testing out new features with users?<p>I wonder if the solution is to be careful to write very simple, well designed code.",1181766870

My requirements are similar to yours, backend ANN's and frontend graph visualization. <p>I'd go with whatever you currently feel most comfortable with. Getting the first version out there in the fastest way possible will give you a chance to judge feasibility and traction. <p>The minor differences between current popular languages and frameworks will the least of the problems in getting the app up and running (and honestly inspite of all the wars they don't matter all that much)  <p>As for me I'm using ROR/C++/Javascript.

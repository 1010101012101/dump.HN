I use it to add tags, geo info and clean up pics. I enable the Sync to Web feature, which keeps Google+/Picasa Web up to date.<p>To ensure the copy on Flickr is up to date I registered a program called PhotoSync for Flickr that watches folders for changes and uploads pics. This is still a manual process to set up for the most part since it requires a clean sync; I have to delete all Flickr albums and reupload.<p>I thought I had the solution with PICBACKMAN, which costs $49 a year. It didn&#x27;t handle the meta data for the photos when syncing with Google+/Picasa Web nor did it dedupe when uploading an album. For instance, I add a new pic to a folder it would upload all the other pics again.<p>So, to answer your question. My photos are very important to me and I have spent a great deal of time scanning pre-digital ones into the archive.

To be and to stay fit you need to eat right, exercise and... have good genes. Nothing you can do about your genes, but here&#x27;re little hacks that helped me to not only stay in shape, but also lose 20 lb in 6 months and maintain it. There&#x27;s nothing new, it&#x27;s very easy, but you need to be disciplined about this.<p>1) Eat 4-5 small meals a day with plenty of veggies and protein. Exclude any processed food and ANYTHING with corn syrup. Read the ingredients. If there are words that you don&#x27;t know - don&#x27;t eat it. I never starve, never diet. But I also don&#x27;t eat more than I need. If you drink alcohol, try to stay away from beer and cocktails. When I drink socially, I usually either have a glass of wine, or go straight to hard liquor (cognac, tequila, vodka).<p>2) Work-out 3-4 times a week (every other day) for only 20-30 minutes. To be effective you can work out with you weight: push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups crunches, etc. The key is to go with no breaks, and do 3 sets to maximum repetitions, while alternating different exercises. When I&#x27;m short on time, I do 10 pull-ups, 20 jumping push-ups, 30 jumping lunges, 40 sit-ups. And I repeat the cycle 3 times without breaks. It takes me 15-20 minutes. Then I shadow box, or, stretch, or lift weights, depending on my time and mood.<p>So, this routine works well and doesn&#x27;t require much time.<p>P.S. And have lots of sex! It&#x27;s kind of &quot;refills&quot; your social and exercise points all at once. :))))",1423449805

To get there from our village involved getting to town and then another two miles the other side of town, opposite a garage, was the place where you could buy a pint of milk and some other items at a premium price.<p>The UK retail landscape has changed dramatically since then and in unanticipated ways. Newsagents ceased to be the cornerstone of community that they once were, nowadays we have convenience stores where most people don&#x27;t walk out with a newspaper under their arm.<p>Maggie Thatcher was the one that pushed for the Sunday trading laws to be changed, thereafter we became a nation of shoppers (rather than shopkeepers, which was how we described Britain before then). I did not shop on Sunday for many years after that as I did not see the point of having sales spread out over 7 days. Also remember that we also had half day trading on Wednesdays (or another mid-week day) in most towns. So this was a big change.<p>I think that we would do well to re-visit Sunday trading with more &#x27;Bank Holidays&#x27; on Sundays. The weekend after pay day might be good for Sunday trading with the rest of the Sundays being retail free days.

9019463,comment,9018501,9018501,0,0,Aqwis,,,"The article notes that Germany bans shopping on Sundays. Indeed, many European countries ban stores from being open at certain times of day or on Sundays. For the sake of curiosity I will attempt to elucidate the various restrictions, and exceptions to those restrictions, that we have in Norway.<p>* Since 2003 (before which stores could not be open past 21:00), there have been no restrictions on opening hours on weekdays. Most supermarkets and grocery stores in urban areas are open until 23:00 -- a few are even open around the clock. In a lot of Europe, the common closing time for grocery stores seems to be 21:00 or so.<p>* Stores are, in general, not permitted to be open on Sundays.<p>* Since 1998, stores with a floor area of under 100 square metres, and only those that primarily sell groceries, have been permitted to open on Sundays.<p>* For petrol stations, the floor area limit is 150 square metres.<p>* If a store is judged to be in an area of particular interest to tourists, it can open on Sundays regardless of floor area.<p>* Before major holidays, stores can open on Sundays regardless of floor area. My local grocery store interprets this as allowing it to open on all Sundays in December, but perhaps curiously, most stores do not seem to open on Sundays in December.<p>(* There might well be more restrictions and exceptions that I&#x27;m unaware of.)<p>* The current government planned to lift all restrictions on opening hours on Sundays, but after opposition from the major supermarket chains (virtually all supermarkets/grocery stores in Norway are operated by a handful of chains) the plans were put on ice.<p>A lot of this comes down to the contrast between the ostensibly rights-driven American politics and the more consensus-driven politics in many European politics. While in the US the government openly cooperating with major businesses to ensure their smooth operation without any major disruptions would probably be seen by the general public as corruption, it would not be seen (and is not seen), in my opinion, in that way in much of Europe -- but rather as doing what&#x27;s necessary and natural to ensure the smooth functioning of society. Not just with regards to the grocery stores themselves, but also with regards to the values of society. A lot of people, even many who are not religious, see the &quot;resting day&quot; as a value that&#x27;s worth preserving, and ditching it in favour of the right to keep your store open whenever you want would widely be seen as very foolish.",1423448481

Even browsers with 5% market share (Firefox has 15-20%) have the power to influence design decisions and thus counter browser-based DRM adoption, except strong de facto monopolies (like Google, youtube) that can make or break browsers by supporting or excluding them (youtube has even more influence than Google search currently because of its unique content).

If you want to do one of those things which could be computed at compile time then without it you would have to compute it at runtime. Which means it has to be computed on every execution rather than once by the compiler and if there is some logic error in the code you may not discover the error until that code is actually executed rather than having the compiler find it for you.<p>It also has the potential to save you a lot of duplication. You&#x27;re basically asking the compiler to run a program to convert your C++ program into arbitrarily many similar-but-not-quite-the-same C++ programs, algorithmically. Because it&#x27;s Turing-complete you can do <i>any</i> transformation with it.

Why can&#x27;t we just have a library that does garbage collection, and does it well?<p>Of course, the library should take a couple of parameters (such as the primitives to use for memory barriers, multithreading parameters etc.) I know of the Boehm collector, but it is conservative, so not appropriate for many projects.<p>Also, I&#x27;d expect to find garbage collection (or supporting constructs) in the C++ standard by now, actually.",1414789105

However, adding virtual syscalls is a non-trivial undertaking, and I&#x27;m not experienced enough with kernel internals, which will require wide-ranging changes, including adding special mapping support, hacking the program loader, and tweaking the clock subsystem.<p>Plus you also have to hack userspace. Most importantly you need to add VDSO support to the linker. Refactoring time(2) would be easy, but for higher granularity clocks--gettimeofday(2) and clock_gettime(2)--you need to make careful use of RDTSC and similar instructions for each architecture. _And_ you need to be able to test it well because of synchronization issues on older platforms. On x86, for example, RDTSC is synchronized, but for a long time it varied across cores, and when Intel and AMD fixed that there was a still a small product window where it could vary across CPU packages.<p>It really is an intrusive change.",1414788812

8541046,comment,8540290,8540290,0,0,lhorie,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the author of Mithril.js (one of said Javascript frameworks)<p>Honestly I didn&#x27;t find this article very good. For example, it says things like &quot;RequireJS is one of the popular instruments for resolving dependencies... AngularJS goes a little bit further by giving us something called factory&quot;, which show some bias towards Angular, when in reality RequireJS is quite a bit more sophisticated (it allows you to bundle things offline and have async modules, for example), whereas Angular is just an IoCC (and the magic shorthand syntax is actually not recommended for production).<p>Also disagree with this to a certain extent: &quot;I like the idea of turning features off and on.&quot; Being able to turn things <i>off</i> is a bad default. Imagine joining a new team, and you write some code and it blows up because their underscore is actually not underscore but a shim missing half of the functionality.<p>Also disagree with &quot;The popular two-way data binding should not be a feature, but a must-have core functionality.&quot; Two-way data binding is expensive (and can get prohibitively so in a sufficiently complex page). There&#x27;s a reason Angular people recommend not going over 2000 bindings on a page, and ironically out-of-the-box data binding solutions tend to completely ignore things like the event delegation model, which is a powerful performance tool (I wrote about it here <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/asymmetrical-data-bindings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog/asymmetrical-data-bindi...</a> ).<p>In general, I feel his experience with templating engines comes across as a bit shallow. For example, &quot;The framework of the future should make us think only about the data and only about the markup. Nothing in between.&quot; This is idealistic.

Since the company doing the assessment isn&#x27;t the one hiring you, they can tell you what you need to work on, even provide training opportunities.<p>Imagine someone telling you, &quot;You aren&#x27;t quite what we need, take these onlike courses and pass them and we will almost definitely be able to find someone to hire you.&quot;<p>And by acting as an intermediary between prospective employees and employers, the time cost of submitting resumes to employers that aren&#x27;t well matched is decreased.<p>Further you might be partially eligible for a job, but lack specific skills, and they can ask if you are willing to take a temporary pay cut in return for on the job training as you work.<p>One of the things personally holding me back, is that you really need to be in school to get an internship.  I already have a degree, just not in CS, and I&#x27;d love to be able to learn on the job at the intern level, instead of feeling stuck unless I go back for a master&#x27;s degree.<p>I think there is a real opportunity, not just for such a company, but for a company that creates a standard or standards for assessment and licenses it/them to different companies.<p>Further, such assessments would be useful to assess not just individuals, but educational programs.

Instead me in my friends made what is called &#x27;marijuana milk&#x27;. First you Decarboxylate the marijuana for about 30 minutes. Then you mix it with milk and you boil that for a while.<p>I remember reading once that the world that you perceive around you is put together by your brain. The world is not actually a as unified and persistent as we &#x27;see&#x27; it. That&#x27;s just the brain doing a good job of filtering and parsing the signals that bombard it. It was during my &#x27;weed-milk&#x27; adventure that I first experienced what this meant.<p>Well on my way in the adventure I was looking at a tv show (bob&#x27;s burgers) that was running. I saw the images and understood what I was looking at. While watching I heard these strange echoes and harsh noises. They were very strange and disjointed sounds, there&#x27;s really nothing like it. I investigated the sounds in my head and it was then that the &#x27;echoes&#x27; transformed into the voices of the characters on screen. It was like my brain had failed to connect the linguistic center and the audio center together. And I was only hearing &#x27;unparsed&#x27; sound waves (as weird as that sounds). After that the echoes would come and go if I didn&#x27;t concentrate. It&#x27;s as if thinking about it flipped the &#x27;parse_sounds_as_a_language&#x27; switch somewhere.<p>There&#x27;s really nothing like it, the best part, imo, is that you&#x27;re still somewhat rational while all this is happening. You&#x27;re very conscious of the things that are &#x27;different&#x27; and I always felt that I could &#x27;investigate&#x27; and communicate to others what exactly was different while stoned/high.",1414787267

     bodies&#x27; resources by depositing eggs on the ground for the final week or
     so of development. Moms in harsh mountain climates, by contrast, might
     find that it&#x27;s more efficient to protect their young by keeping them
     longer inside their bodies.&quot;

     Surely you&#x27;re being elliptical, but even throwing in a phrase like &quot;in a
     sense&quot; or better &quot;in a metaphorical sense&quot; would help things out here. But
     better to leave it out entirely. The skinks aren&#x27;t &quot;opting&quot; for anything.

Traditional eastern european rhythms are incredibly complex and western european liturgical and vernacular music tended to have complex ryhthms until around the 16-17th century.<p>IIRC this was basically an effect of the church decided to try to monopolize music in the service of liturgy <i>and</i> &quot;dumb down&quot; the music so that everyone could participate in hymnals, etc.<p>This could also partially be a result of music printing; it&#x27;s harder to notate complex rhythms - if you&#x27;ve ever sung medieval music that&#x27;s pushed into modern notation, sometimes wierd things happen, like time signatures that don&#x27;t quite line up with the all of the music lines because polyphony is going on; invasions of 3/4 measures in an otherwise 2/4 song, etc.",1414786917

We are friends and the question:<p>How did the USSR develop H-bombs so fast?<p>1.)of course there were NO SPIES and or alleged &#x27;collaborators inside
the USA system.&#x27;<p>2.)there&#x27;s a long history of autoiobography memoirs of leaders of
alleged &#x27;EVIL EMPIRE.&#x27;  Yeltsin is mentioned by name in book by
DEFECTOR Albek, Biohazard - secret biowar weapons.<p>3.)Yeltsin calls it a &#x27;research facility&#x27; and it is true that it was inside
a &#x27;milk factory&#x27; - going by memory, so check the book.<p>4.)Did the USSR need computers like Intel chip with the
obvioius flaws of sinh, transcendental numbers buillt into the
instruction set architecture?<p>5.)Answer: everything fails in the USSR empire EXCEPT FOR
excellent education as leaders in math and physics and
moscow ballet who not works for Cirque du Soleil.<p>6.) The SECRET of GOOGLE TALENT?  recruit from russia and
promise plenty of vodka drinks / free snacks.<p>7.)simply review Khrushchev&#x27;s flattery speech against the background
of the Russian tank.  The result of Russia vs. Finland was the
FINLAND inventors making  MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.
These homemade grenades would set the engine air filter on fire
resulting in engine exposions.<p>Finland has NO grenades. Allegedly double crossed by Britain and
the allies.  Tanks were pinned down by children pouring water to
make slick ice skating ponds for the USSR TANKS.<p>So, the Russian Tanks had advanced designs and deep thinking.
The manufacturing was horrible.<p>12.)Supreme leader former of USSR Khrushchev is sadly misinformed.
&quot;comrade HN of the first order.&quot;  Please do not laugh.<p>Much of the books on H bomb development show the
trial and error and strong need for basic physics, rather than the
IBM Microsoft Windows software game emulations, IMHO.<p>As the USSR defector who ran the bioweapons labs put it
the scientists and organizational structures were filled with
KGB agents.<p>The KGB agents were &#x27;incompetent scientists&#x27; who seem to be
only interested in snooping, rather than doing real work.
The TOP KGB had 2 or 4 phones on their desks and often no
PC computer, as they had NO ENGINEERING BACKGROUND.<p>So, support of scientists and engineers BULIDING THE H BOMB
with ADVANCED IBM computers is unlikely in such a culture of
paranoia.<p>PS. many of the KGB... they are gone so insert other 3 letter acronym
is going back to typewriters and paper.  It must be a capitalist
plot this Microsoft Windows aka &#x27;Evil Empire.&#x27;<p>insert your favorite quote from Austin Powers movie  here.

interesting.  no need for very complex nuclear codes and the

The practical choice is to align on a power of 2.<p>When UUIDs were invented, they were based on a MAC address plus a timestamp. MAC addresses are 48 bits, leaving 16 bits. Of these, between 1 and 3 are used up giving the variant code and another four bits are used giving the version code.<p>If they&#x27;d used 64 bits, there&#x27;d be between 8 and 11 bits left for a unique timestamp. Which is OK, but not a very strong guarantee for a &quot;unique&quot; scheme.<p>As it happens the length has made it possible to create multiple versions of UUIDs that are generated in different ways. UUID has been successful at separating the concerns of the structure of the ID from how it is generated. Most alternative schemes are effectively implementation-defined.",1414786003

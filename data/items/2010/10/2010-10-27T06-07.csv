So if you've got that land sitting idle, and you're not collecting income from rent, nor using it yourself, you're going to lose money on it.  This is an incentive to sell it to someone who will make money, or otherwise find a way to employ it more productively.<p>That said, I don't think I'd really like to see property taxes on domain names.",1288162739

There's no actual assurance that someone's core business means that they may be more secure. As for the issue regarding sniffers, in the UK if the VPN termination is in the UK and they're providing a service, then under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill they may be considered an ISP, and would therefore be required to keep traffic logs. In other countries YMMV.<p>Likewise, if the endpoint is being used for malicious activity targeted against the critical national infrastructure of country foo, the provider is not necessarily going to have the option to become aware of the interception of their exit traffic.<p>With your own server it may or may not be more secure, and may or may not be intercepted at the endpoint, but providing you can reasonably configure it the only person that would attract state-level interception (over and above other local connections) would be you.",1288161992

The expected value of a startup is the percentage chance it's Google.""  [It is your inclusion of this sentence that caused me to characterize your change of heart about it as ""grudging.""]<p>""Most data structures exist because of speed. For example, many languages today have both strings and lists. Semantically, strings are more or less a subset of lists in which the elements are characters. So why do you need a separate data type? You don't, really. Strings only exist for efficiency. But it's lame to clutter up the semantics of the language with hacks to make programs run faster. Having strings in a language seems to be a case of premature optimization.""  [Processing strings is a <i>huge</i> part of today's computing landscape.  There are premature optimizations to be sure, but efficient string processing isn't one of them IMHO.]<p>""But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?""  [The implication here is that because picking the right companies matters <i>more</i>, then it doesn't make sense to ""quibble"" over valuations.  But this is a false dichotomy.  Picking the right companies matters, of course.  But valuation matters as well, and questioning a ~10M valuation for a company that has no revenue is not ""quibbling.""]<p>""...  jerks who give you lines like ""come back to me to fill out the round.""  [I have no problem with advising founders to avoid wasting time on reluctant investors.  I do have a problem with impugning their motives and character.]<p>If you really want to engage in a debate about this I will hold up my end.  But to be perfectly honest, I'd just as soon see this bruhaha fade into obscurity.  It has already gotten much more attention that it deserves IMHO.",1288159555

As a dependent, you don't get a personal exemption but you'll get a standard deduction of $5,700 (in your specific case).  Its important for you to pay your taxes on that income because you're parents are legally required to pay any tax that you owe.<p>Also, you're going to have substantial income tax (remember to pay your self-employment tax as well: 15.3%) because you have limited expenses.<p>As for incorporation, it really depends on what you're going to do with your apps in the future.  Incorporating will help you facilitate selling them in the future because you could simply sell the company and easily move on or you could be the next Zynga and use the legal entity to get funding haha.<p>I dont see apps having any liability issues, so you're main concern is going to be business related decisions.  I'd suggest that you incorporate as a S-Corp because you could avoid paying self-employment tax (SE) by planning around it.  Make a reasonable guaranteed salary payment to yourself and you can at least avoid paying the 15.3% for self employment tax over the salary. I think 40K would be a reasonable salary.  So, you'd save somewhere around $5,355 dollars in tax.  This is just one simply way of saving on taxes.",1288159539

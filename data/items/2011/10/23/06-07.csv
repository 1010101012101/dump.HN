3145437,comment,3144391,3144391,4,0,judofyr,,,"It seems that people forget what ""model"" (in MVC) really means. A model (in general) is a <i>simplification of the world</i>. The world is so complex that you can't possibly reason about it at once, so you split it up into smaller models that are easier to understand. It's exactly the same in MVC: the model is the <i>definition</i> of your application's world; a simplification that your computer can work with.<p>Yes, Rails ship with ActiveRecord, which makes it dead simple to define data models that you need to store, but the app/models/ is far from limited to <i>only</i> data storage. app/models is about the <i>business logic</i> of your application. It seems to me that all of the files the article wanted to place under lib/ actually belongs under app/models.<p>Yes, I agree that it's nice to be able to test your application outside of Rails, but whether you place the files under app/models or lib/ doesn't change that. Yes, it might be useful to abstract it out to a gem, and <i>then</i> you can move it into a lib/-directory (since there is no MVC of a Ruby library), but as long as you're inside the realm of a Rails application you should put everything that's related to the <i>business logic</i> in app/models.<p>So, in summary:<p>If it's related to the BUSINESS LOGIC of your app: Put it in app/models.<p>If it's just GENERAL stuff: Put it in lib/ (or better: create a gem out of it).",1319353126

Since the first study, the emotion recognition and face recognition results have been replicated in one additional randomized controlled study, though not yet peer reviewed (dissertations and masters theses).  The latest emotion recognition results were in a randomized controlled study in a California school district - i.e. a more challenging environment.

""Evangelist""/Advisor to the CEO-guys....<p>One very recent example of a large private media company in Germany: They have a couple of technolgy evangelists reporting to the Owner of the company.

They just repeat the current buzzwords (""it must be key/value and loosely coupled!"" because Google and Amazon does it.). The problem is: That's true but it's not what the company needs to achieve the project goals. If you have no users, why do you want to scale from the beginning? It's an iterative process, also: premature optimization is the root of all evil.<p>As most of the media companies/publisheres are private companies (or at least the mayority is still owned by the founding families) they have no external pressure to fix their broken strategies/HR/management.<p>They can keep losing money in their current business for another 10-15 years until they have to shut down large parts. So they still try to get away with crappy IT products.<p>Another story:<p>Internet Explorer 6 is still quite common in the enterprise area in Germany. Why? Because SAP sold crappy technology.

3145381,comment,3145080,3145289,7,0,littlegiantcap,,,"When I think back to when I was in first or second grade I can see a direct correlation between technology and the areas I've always excelled at. For instance, I've always been very strong in History. When I was at an elementary school level I would come home and play World War 2 themed video games, Oregon Trail, Age of Empires, etc. this sparked huge amounts of interest in me, and led me deeper into these subjects. My parents told me a story about how when I was in third grade my class got to go to our school library. I went up to a librarian, and asked her for a book on The French resistance in Paris during the Nazi occupation. The reason why I asked? I had been playing the medal of honor video game. So from my end, I think technology can definitely be a boon to education, as long as you're making sure that the content that children are getting from them is good.",1319351141

The summary (tl; dr) is as follows:<p>1) Large institutional long investments in a certain type of wheat future (Chicago soft red winter) started crowding out the real customers of physical wheat, such as bakers.<p>2) Because wheat varieties are moderately fungible/exchangeable, the downstream bakers started to use a different brand of wheat (Minneapolis hard red spring) and changed their recipes accordingly.<p>3) This second class of wheat is very widely consumed, and bidding up its price caused riots and food shortages around the world (or so the reporter states. He didn't provide specific examples, as this predates the Arab Spring).<p>The overall effect is if a particular food staple suddenly became a fashion item, with wealthy people buying it off the market for non-dietary purposes at such a rate that poor people could not afford it.<p>However, the key bit I don't understand, and which the reporter doesn't explain, is how commodity fund investors didn't lose their shirts by betting on wheat to keep going up.

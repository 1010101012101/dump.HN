Been planning on using this API for some time but only got stuck into research on it today.<p>Just wondering why something that is version 7 is still in some limited pilot program and not widely available? In looking around I've seen the same message from Microsoft, whether it be in blogs, on forums or direct email, that it will be released to all at some point but no date. These are from varying dates to, some over a year old sound like the same message as today.<p>What's the hold up on this thing or is it just a case of big advertisers being given priority while anyone without a track record of big adcenter spend being left behind?",1291301977

1962275,comment,1962003,1962178,0,0,ericHosick,,,"I think one problems with TDD is that it doesn't lean towards testing bugs in a feature/scenario (describing the whole design). That is, TDD focuses on testing a unit and it is effective/fast at testing the fringe cases of units.<p>Behavior Driven Development really shines in the aspect of ""completely describing the design"" as it focuses on driving development against a well defined behavior (using scenarios). BDD lets you know where the bug is: in the code or in the specifications (the behavior as specified by the customer). So there is a lot less ""chasing around"". If you are trying to cover behavior of a system only using TDD then I agree you can end up chasing around a bug.<p>However, both are necessary and highly effective when used together.",1291301709

Most of the ATM serve us well with the deposit/withdrawal/application of services, etc. Think about the current offerings of the bank which can be moved to the ATMs, internet, etc.<p>- We do need to go to the bank when there is a sense of urgency to get things done. E.g. loans, lost of cards, etc. All the touch points if handled well by the bank can really improve the customer service level.<p>Think emotion = help = love.<p>But after last financial crisis, not sure if they do trust the bank this much now.",1291301647
1962271,comment,1959697,1960930,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Pointing out things that are broken is easy, so I apologize if I do too much of it.<p>Suggesting possible solutions is much tougher.<p>But you asked, so I owe it to whomever cares to at least give it a shot.<p>The idea/structure of wikileaks itself is broken, and here's why: for some reason they've went down the road of promoting Assange and going for the big stories. This would be a great idea if you wanted to foment the next Marxist revolution or create a new internet rock-star, but it ain't going to work if you really care about people and want a better world.<p>If you asked me to create a list of things that should remain secret, no matter how good or bad the government is, at the top of the list would be things like tactical military reports, state department cables, personnel matters, security, and negotiations.  For that very reason, these are the ""hot button"" issues -- the ones that give wikileaks the biggest bang for their buck. So they love those kinds of stories. And they're exactly the issues where they are going to piss off the most people. Wikileaks can't be a publicity hound and also be a force for good. The two don't go together. People will buy into the idea that too many secrets are kept, but there's no way in hell they're ever going to buy into the idea that some guy in Europe knows better than the will of the taxpayer.<p>It keeps getting back to that -- pissing off people. Whatever a person wants to do to instigate change, he/she has to piss off more people at the way secrecy currently works than he does piss off more people at the leakers themselves. Wikileaks is failing miserably here.<p>So I'd suggest a truly anonymous version of wikileaks that had an high ethical standard of what they would not publish -- things like alcohol addiction treatment of top government executives, or any top secret cable that mentions sources. (These standards would need to be developed)<p>A set of public ethics, along with a faceless dump of information, would generate much less initial hype, but would have a greater effect in the long run. You could even have people who ""spoke"" for the leaking organization but were not associated with it in any way, thereby separating the operation of the group and the publicity of it.<p>You want to tick me off as a taxpayer over how much secrecy there is? Try dumping the legislative notes of the Agriculture department, how deep they're tangled up in big business and how much they use secrecy to cover for that. Or how much secrecy is used by the FDA to use politics to make decisions on drug approval. There are hundreds of examples like this. And don't make everything so sure to tick off the right-wing in America. This is a structural problem, not a political one, and you'll have right and left wings of politics forever, no matter what your government structure. So leak some stuff on leftist organizations in Europe. Leak some stuff about China. Whatever you do, don't purposely antagonize one group or another. Dish out the medicine evenly.<p>Assange's argument of disrupting information flow between the nodes doesn't require flashy news conferences and huge PR events. Sure, that's more fun and gives folks a better visceral feeling of making a difference, but if you really want change, you don't need to be emotionally fulfilled, you need to do the things that over 20 years or so will actually change things. So far this aint' it.<p>Play chess, not checkers.",1291301601

After over 13 years, SoftArtisans still maintains the exciting atmosphere of a startup, giving employees exceptional opportunities to significantly impact the company and the products we develop. The SoftArtisans team is a close-knit group of people who like to both share new challenges and have fun.  Every day, we collaborate at our desks, over lunch in the common kitchen, or over the foosball table - whether it is to come up with solutions to new programming challenges we've have run into, to discuss ways to improve the company, or to make plans for a laser-bagel-cutting-toaster and continuous bread machine.  We are encouraged to pursue our individual interests, with hackathons consisting of multiple days dedicated exclusively to work on personal projects or to pick up new skills.  In one such hackathon our team members built a model car controlled remotely by an Android AI via Bluetooth, picked up a new language, created a browser based game with HTML5, modified git to improve the log interface, and tried out a new restaurant for lunch, all while finishing a release package. We also hold various after work activities ranging from a night of board games to jumping out of a plane.<p>For more information, check out <a href=""http://softartisans.com/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://softartisans.com/careers.html</a> or send your resume to hr@softartisans.com with the position(s) you are interested in.",1291300893

Because I worked so hard to figure out what the hell was going on for so long, the actual coding from scratch took less than a month. Bottom line - if you're being paid well, like the environment and think the company has potential and that you have room to grow there, give it some time before you decide to quit.",1291298515

People say 'C is best for systems programming', that I worded it more weakly is irrelevant.<p>2.) Lisp has been in use in AI, since before the birth of AI. It is still used in AI, and there has been plenty of success with it. There is plenty of 'constant conjunction' (to borrow the causative definition from Hume), associated with Lisp and AI.<p>Acting as if his use of Lisp couldn't have given him an advantage in an AI contest is pretty much the ultimate lisp denial-ism.",1291298510

I'll just learn it.'  (At least, nobody that thinks logically.)  It doesn't work that way.  (Okay, granted, some small number of people might think that and actually succeed at it.

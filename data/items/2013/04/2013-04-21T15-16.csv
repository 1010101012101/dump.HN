A ""common"" camera in a new deployment is a 1080p (2.1 Megapixel) camera.  If this is set to record good quality images 24/7, it consumes about 60GB of storage per day.  Various tricks like ""record on motion"", etc. can reduce this to maybe 10GB/day, at the risk of potentially missing key evidence or having gaps in the recording.<p>Lenses <i>are</i> important, but it's not that hard to find a lens with sufficient resolution for these cameras.  A good lens rated at 2+ megapixels is around $70-$120 (depending on various factors), and a good outdoor camera (including lens) can be had for $500-$1200.  Big price ranges, yes, but not to the point that the lenses are the limiting factor budget-wise.",1366559907

To benefit from an extreme price crash you either have to short bitcoin or buy a ton of stuff with it. In the latter case it is hard to imagine a merchant honoring such orders if he is not convinced the blockchain is sound.<p>As for shorting bitcoin... It's certainly not impossible. But shorting a few Million of Dollars of Bitcoin? If this is done in any kind of trading account (without the money being physically in the hand of the attacker), the trading institution would probably be out of business because of the price drop anyway, before paying the profits to the attacker...<p>For everyone else... You shouldn't have more than 20 BTC on hand anyway. Preferably a lot less, depending on the rest of your portfolio.

5585189,comment,5584783,5585133,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> This is a common misconception, I think. If you try to model the protocol economically, it's pretty clear that it's a majority of currency holders (what the core developers call an ""economic majority""), not a majority of miners that matters in determining whether a protocol change is valid.<p>Actually, its neither, if you really think about it. Currency users (in exchange) are more important than either miners or holders (with the caveat that you need some number > 0 of miners to validate exchanges) to whether a protocol change has economic effect, but once some group adopts a protocol change, what you have is a fork into two separate currencies until a consensus is achieved.<p>Passive currency holders have little driving force in this; currency users are the main driving force, because wherever its being used is where it will have value. Miners have some force because without some of them, the system collapses.<p>And among currency users, the ones that matter the most are the ones that <i>accept</i> bitcoin for goods and services, not the ones that spend it. (In the ""steady state"" those should be approximately the same, but as long as mining is still producing coins you can have miners/spenders that aren't accepters, and even in the steady state you could have people who inherit hoards and slowly deplete them as users that aren't accepting.)",1366559249

5585177,comment,5584783,5584783,4,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"This may seem cheap, but there are already many, many orders out there for ASIC, and all of the factories are backed up. Butterfly Labs only recently released models that have been on order for many months (I want to say greater than 6). If you put down $1.2 million, it could be months before you got your machines and by then you would no longer control 50% of the mining.<p>This dollar amount is also particularly low because ASIC technology is new - most people who have put money into ASICs aren't even mining yet. Once the technology is settled in, controlling the block chain will become more expensive.<p>Furthermore, the number of things that you can do while controlling the block chain is actually really limited. You still can't spend other people's money. You can prevent people from spending money, but you can't make them spend money. You can double spend yourself, but if the bitcoin community was aware that someone was manipulating the block chain, they would be much more careful about accepting transactions from new wallets, and would reject all transactions from a wallet they knew was controlled by the double spender.<p>Furthermore, if you did take control of the block chain I personally would dump a few thousand into miners myself, to help regain control of the system. I'm sure that I'm not alone, and the act of bitcoin users simply 'fighting back' may be enough to minimize your control of the market.<p>And finally, as other people have stated, you can always change the hashing algorithm. Most people use 1 bitcoin client. In fact, this client once had an update that caused an error and forked the block chain and allowed at least one person to double spend $10,000. In the event of a major crisis, there would most be enough bitcoin users willing to fork the block chain that you could indeed get a new hashing algorithm designed to be incompatible with the attackers hardware. The choice is between that and watch your 'distributed' currency fall under the control of a tyrant.<p>Someone taking control of the mining process IS a risk, and there are some powerful things you can do with that (like mine 100% of all the new bitcoins, taking control of the supply, and double spending, and rejecting transactions by others), but it would probably take a lot more than $1.2 million dollars because people would fight back, and you are still at risk of the rest of the community forking away from your control. That said, you could still do terrible damage and the price would probably plunge, and you may be able to double spend millions of dollars before enough people noticed to start rejecting your transactions. (are there even millions of dollars worth of things you can buy? and would you have to worry about a government getting involved because you committed financial crimes?)<p>And even if you manage to maintain control, all that will happen is people will stop using bitcoin until you let up. It's much like a DDOS. It takes power (electricity) to maintain that much computation, and the longer you maintain control, the less bitcoin will be worth.<p>Edit: I want to add that the scariest attacks only happen at 50% control. At 40%, you can only double spend -sometimes-, and I don't think that you would be able to block transactions at all. Furthermore an organized network (and there is much debate about how organized bitcoin could get, after all it is designed to be distributed) could undo any double spending and you would be limited to slowing bitcoin down. At 20% market power, the probability of you achieving a double spend or undoing some transactions is very small.",1366558981

In the United States, consumer purchase of inexpensive radios that pick up police communication frequencies has been commonplace since the early 1970s (when I first owned one). I remember a Hacker News thread a year or two ago in which a European was surprised that a news report including the name of a person arrested (not tried and convicted, but just arrested) was permitted in the United States. Our historical sense in the United States is that police operations and arrests should be largely in public view, reportable by the news media and observable by the public. Different societies come up with different trade-offs on this issue, in law and in custom, but in the United States arrest records are public (and routinely reported, although often with some time lag, in local weekly newspapers) and police radio activity can be monitored by many private citizens. It was noteworthy this last week that the Boston police make more use of Twitter than many urban police departments, but the general degree of openness observed in the police response to the marathon bombings is fairly typical of the United States.",1366557648

I used the statistics from [1] at 5:20 from day one.<p>Layer 1, 66,631,501 cubelets remaining on the current layer and 33,982,651 cubelets destroyed in total. Because it is the first layer it is made up out of 66,631,501 + 66,631,501 = 100,614,152 cubelets. An estimate of the edge length is obtained by dividing by 6 faces and taking the square root and this yields 4,095.0000407. It is a bit counterintuitive - at least for me - but the actual edge length is 4,096. I would have expected that counting the edges twice and the corners trice becomes insignificant for large edge lengths but if you do the math you will see that this approximation has the limit n - 1 as n goes to infinity.<p>So because every layer adds 2 to the edge length there are 2048 layers. That is bad - there is no central cubelet because the edge length is not odd. Maybe this is the hidden secret. I guess they used 4096 because it simplifies texturing the thing, implementing level of detail or stuff like that, does it? Or they have 8 secrets in there to make it a tiny bit more fair.<p>One more thing, the number of cubelets on the surface of a cube with edge length n is n^3 - (n - 2)^3 - the whole cube minus the smaller cube under the surface. Plugging in 4096 yields the number obtained from the statistics so we probably made no mistake.<p>Okay, let's fix the other numbers, too. The cube started with 68,719,476,736 cubelets. I assume the current layer was 263 - the statistics gives the number of layers removed and layer 263 seems to be more consistent with the time of the comment - and there are 23,220,183,736 cubelets in those layers. Subtracting the 17,758,801 cubelets remaining yields 23,202,424,935 cubelets destroyed in 166 days or roughly 139.8 million cubelets per day. There are 45,517,051,801 cubelets remaining and assuming the same rate of destruction this yields roughly 326 days to go.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giEykqDoUCQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giEykqDoUCQ</a>",1366557445

Also, the initial term ""Lame Ain't an MP3 Encoder"" referred to their use of the original ISO code along with a patch. Since one would have to use the MPEG/ISO code and you couldn't encode mp3 files only using the LAME patch/library, they avoided the patent issue. Since 2000 they have instead shipped source code with a complete rewrite of the ISO code. They also post a notice that an MP3 patent license may be required for use in some countries. According to the conventional interpretation of US patent law, the US would be one of them.<p>Edit: By the way, don't be fooled, our small legal disagreement doesn't affect my very positive view of you as a person and developer :)",1251532797

That's why you should have software monitoring things instead of a human.<p>>Besides – why write more code to check if your original code is correct, when you can just write correct code? And if you write software to check your software, then do you have to write software to check the checking software? Police police police police...<p>Same reason it makes sense to have proof checking software like Metamath.  It's fairly easy to write software that has an 90% probability of being correct.  It's maybe three times harder to write software that has a 99% probability of being correct, so it's cheaper to write 90% likely to be correct software and then another piece of 90% likely to be correct software that checks it.  That's what my intuition says.<p>Anyway, I think monitoring software would be much easier to write than actual trading software.<p>if bank_account < 0.9 * prev_bank_account: stop_trading()",1251531923

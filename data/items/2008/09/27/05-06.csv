At a certain point, this is too much to pay for all but a few applications (where energy density is needed most, or where the stored hydrocarbons can be used for other purposes).<p>Already the oil infrastructure is some of the most complicated and costly equipment in the world. We don't <i>know</i> where that economic break even point will be, but we do realize that one must exist. This, among other things, is driving futures. Each new type of oil requires a new type of capital investment. The involved parties are making gambles on future technology. Further influencing this is the fact that it's polluting enough to, potentially, influence much of the world away from it, thereby reducing the attractiveness of such bets.",1222494915

I like the modularity and ORM and Template and HTTP server agnostic approach, which is similar to merb.<p>One of key benefits of merb over the many other lightweight and more modular ruby frameworks is it has the necessary critical developer mass and funding behind it from Engine Yard <a href=""http://engineyard.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineyard.com</a>",1222494808

316763,comment,316456,316503,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I think it was on some 37 Signals thread that a reader pointed out that  aphorisms always seemed to come in opposing pairs.  ""Many hands make light work""; ""Too many chefs spoil the broth"".  That sort of thing.  Yet each seemed to speak the truth.<p>Much of what can be found on ""start up"" blogs are business aphorisms; they have an air of pithy truth, but are often lacking in any real backing or substance.  With some moderate effort, equally compelling yet opposing pearls of insight can be constructed.  Show people either one and most  would be nodding  their heads in agreement.<p>Any topic of interest is complex, and there are many seemingly contradictory observations you can make that are true in some way but are not the whole story.    There's a tendency, though, for readers to latch onto the things they most want to be true and ignore the rest, regardless of no actual backing evidence being provided.",1222492746

316760,comment,316506,316506,0,0,streblo,,,"This data doesn't surprise me whatsoever. I'm an undergrad and these numbers are close to what I'd predict for my university. I don't know a single person with a landline. Everyone I know owns a laptop and has it registered on the university network. I'm incredibly surprised whenever I meet someone and find that they don't have a facebook profile. The only difference is that I don't know as many people with an iPhone/iPod touch, but I suspect that's because most people in my class (c/o 2009) have cell phones and older generation iPods and don't feel the need to replace them.",1222492064

Paired with datamapper <a href=""http://datamapper.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datamapper.org</a> it is a clean room rewrite of what rails could have been.  I'm not knocking rails.  It is what it is, but the rails code base has its problems and is not written for performance or enterprise security from the beginning.

That&#x27;s a significant part of society. So, a social security net which doesn&#x27;t include this is more of a social security black hole with a few ropes, only useful for people who have some weird &quot;model life&quot; (e.g. a student without anyone who depends on him) and not for normal people. Usually this goes against the stated goals of social security nets which are introduced to allow people to take risks which could be useful for society without ruining their lifes in case of a failure.",1425718716

But that is the whole point:
It is warranted, because it is imposed on the providers( at least until law changes).
It is quite obvious that ISPs have no interest in doing so by them selves.<p>Netflix was slow because Verizon throttled their traffic, not because they didn&#x27;t have the capacities to route it properly.
They simply wanted a piece of the Netflix Pie.
So net neutrality will prevent that not cause it.<p>2)
This is not about the big content providers at all. They would simply pay the ISPs a fee and pass it on to their customers.
So net neutrality actually prevents increased consumer fees.<p>>I had as much neutrality as I wanted or needed before the FCC got involved, from the 3+ wireline and 5+ wireless providers in my area (San Francisco)<p>3)
The fact that you can choose from so many ISPs in SF is good for you, but you are probably well aware that in more rural parts of the country this is not the case. What will people in those areas do, if their only ISP decides to throttle a protocol
that is important to them?<p>4)
Most importantly, the traffic we create is growing constantly. Not only Downstream but Upstream.
Especially since more and more &quot;services&quot; become decentralized.
Decentralizing architectures is one of the biggest challenges we face today as internet citizens.
Decentralized search engines, social networks and who knows what will come in the next decades.
Decentralized Systems are more democratic, enable people to actively take part and give us back a piece of independence from the goverment (no, i am not an Anti-Gov&#x27;t lunatic) as well as corporations.
But for that we need to have our packets routed from A to B without being throttled, because some ISP cannot make a quick buck out of it.<p>Thank You for Your time!",1425717906

Shaw&#x27;s approach is that they&#x27;re doing molecular dynamics, i.e. simulation.  You get to watch the motion of every atom in the system.  That allows for a close investigation of a given protein&#x27;s movements, which is great especially if you&#x27;re trying to learn about its biology.  Unfortunately, it is rather computationally expensive; while I don&#x27;t know DESRES&#x27;s latest stats, I&#x27;ve seen reports on large parallel MD simulations completing about once per day.<p>In contrast, we&#x27;ve posed the question of binding as a machine learning problem.  Neural networks are computationally expensive to train, but make predictions quickly.  Our system can assess millions of protein-drug pairs per day, since we&#x27;re not simulating the motion of every atom.  You don&#x27;t get to watch what each atom is doing, but you get insight into the behavior of lots of potential medicines.",1425717803

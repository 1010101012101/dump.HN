None of this is personal, just things I&#x27;ve spent time thinking about in the context of building social software.  I could be entirely wrong or confused and unjustified in my opinions.<p>We edit ourselves &quot;offline,&quot; too.  The &quot;self&quot; we present to our co-workers is different than the &quot;self&quot; we present to our family, friends, or lovers.  Do you think people &quot;edit&quot; themselves more or less on Facebook or Instagram than they do when they&#x27;re, say, at a job interview or on a first date?<p>And, sure, how we present ourselves online may not be the &quot;most accurate representation of what really goes on,&quot; but is this more or less editing than you hiding your professional struggles from your closest friends because they act and talk as if you&#x27;re more successful than you really are?  Consider, for example, a husband and father who is close to losing his job.  &quot;Hey Sam, how&#x27;s work going?&quot; &quot;Hey honey, how was work today?&quot; &quot;Hey daddy, do you love your job?  Will you be the boss one day? I think you&#x27;d make a great boss.&quot;<p>And this isn&#x27;t even to talk about the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives.  We delude ourselves in a million ways, big and small, every day.  This is normal and necessary.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; editing, as if we decide what percentage of ourselves to reveal to other people or as if there&#x27;s some indivisible, Platonic &quot;identity&quot; that I possess.  It&#x27;s more like an actor putting on a show.  It depends on the actor, the play, the stage, and the audience.  Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in <i>X-Men</i> is no more or less authentic than Hugh Jackman as Curly in <i>Oklahoma!</i>.  Maybe the part of him in Wolverine isn&#x27;t brought out anywhere else in his life, in which case there&#x27;s a way in which Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is both more <i>and</i> less authentic than Hugh Jackman as his everyday self (whatever that means).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that &quot;we&#x27;re caught trying to one up each other talking about our offline lives on these social networks.&quot;  We do that offline plenty.  What online social networks <i>do</i> provide is a discrete and, until now, unparalleled measure of control over how I express myself.  I can invent a whole new self on Instagram if I want and I can delete it when I&#x27;m done with it.  I can&#x27;t do that with my friends, at least not without risking my friendship or becoming known as &quot;that guy who reinvents himself all the time.&quot;  This opens up whole new fields of expression and play.<p>For example, in your product your photos expire.  Yes, this lowers the &quot;cost to my identity.&quot;  One consequence of this might be that folks reveal more of their &quot;authentic self,&quot; whatever that means.  Another consequence might be  that they ham it up in ways they&#x27;d consider inappropriate in a more permanent or serious context.  Another consequence might be that people turn it into a game where, because you know every photo has an expiration date, you try to see how much attention you can get in that timeframe.  This will naturally lead to crazier, more extreme, and more controversial forms of expression.<p>This isn&#x27;t a product critique, BTW.  I think what you&#x27;re doing is interesting, but I think you&#x27;re fooling yourself if you believe that somehow folks will be more &quot;authentic&quot; on your service, in part because I think the idea of the &quot;authentic self&quot; is a bit of a fiction.  If folks find that your service lets them express part of themselves that they couldn&#x27;t before or were afraid to before, that&#x27;s great!  If you get a critical density of people doing that you have a successful social network!  But I think &quot;authenticity&quot; isn&#x27;t the axis along which those expressions will fall.<p>I actually think if you over-focus on &quot;authenticity&quot; you run the risk of making bad product decisions.  What happens if folks start using your service to do things you consider inauthentic?  Do you ban them?  Do you try to curtail the behavior through product design and other feedback mechanisms?  If you do, you run the risk of squashing the kinds of activity that can lead to a robust network.  Those unexpected expressions are exactly what a community or tribe building a sense of identity look like, even if you disagree with that conception of identity or consider it inauthentic.",1377728915

They are springing up everywhere and the seniors opting for these communities are going to tend to be energetic, into new things and more financially well off.  Most, if not all, of these communities have e-mail lists and calendars of events and activities that they send out to the residents every week or month because one of their selling points is that they offer fun and unique things to keep the residents active and having fun. See if you can get them to feature your games in their e-mails or newsletters. These are all over the country. Just google &quot;active senior living communities&quot; and similar key phrases. (Note: These are different from &quot;nursing homes&quot; so emphasis on &quot;active.&quot;)<p>(2) This is probably tougher if you&#x27;re not really into marketing and &quot;selling yourself,&quot; but, do PR. From the local to national level there are great opportunities. Thousands of local newspapers still print everyday or every week and might find a feature about your game apps cool. But you&#x27;d have to craft it into a story that is enticing and verifiable (e.g. &quot;A growing trend you wouldn&#x27;t expect: Senior gamers&quot;). On this page you can find local newspapers by state and start contacting them  or hire a PR rep  to pitch your story: <a href=""http://www.usnpl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnpl.com</a>.  Even at the national level there are great opportunities. For example, Hoda Kotb and Kathy Lee Gifford do the last hour of the Today show on NBC and they are always featuring apps that make like easier or more fun. Plus, Kathy Lee is your target demographic (she just turned 60 and they celebrated on the show) so see if you can pitch the producers. Try CNN too  especially on weekends their demographic skews to 50+. And, of course, pitch AARP. ;-)<p>-Felicia Joy",1377728335

6293035,comment,6291123,6292942,1,0,contingencies,,,"My bad. That sounds logical, though a bit SPOFfy. FYI on our system instead of providing an image (since the format is hard to fix if we want to support arbitrary OSs and arbitrary cloud providers) we first provide a script that can assemble (or acquire) an image (after which it is versioned), and also specify a linked test suite.<p>That way, a particular build of a platform (<i>ubuntu-12.04-20130808</i>) that we create on a cloud provider could be used, or alternatively a particular cloud provider&#x27;s stock image (<i>someprovider-ubuntu-12.04-xyz</i>) or existing bare metal machine matching the general OS class in a conventional hosting environment could also be used.<p>The idea is that where bugs are found (defined as &quot;application installs fine on our images, but not on <i><some other existing platform instead></i>&quot;) new tests can be added to the platform integrity test suite to detect such issues, and/or workarounds can be added to facilitate their support.<p>That way, when an application developer says &quot;app-3.1 targets <i>ubuntu</i>&quot; we can potentially test against many different Ubuntu official release versions on many different images on many different cloud providers or physical hosts. (Possibly determining that it only works on <i>ubuntu</i> above a certain version number.) Similarly, the app could target a particular version of <i>ubuntu</i>, or a particular range of build numbers of a particular version of <i>ubuntu</i>.<p>It&#x27;s sort of a mid-way point offering a compromise of flexibility versus pain between the <i>chef</i>/<i>puppet</i> approach (which I intensely disagree with for deployment purposes in this era of virt) and the <i>docker</i> approach (which makes sense but could be viewed as a bit restrictive when attempting to target arbitrary platforms or use random existing or bare metal infrastructure).<p>Also, would you consider the architectural concern I outlined valid? I mean, in the case you are pulling down network-provided packages or doing other arbitrary network things when installing... it seems to be like there is a serious risk of configuration drift or outright failure.",1377727850

6293022,comment,6288239,6288239,2,0,Dewie,,,"> To me, this has always seemed a bit futile as well as overkill. You&#x27;re still sedentary. You&#x27;re providing very little benefit to your overall well being and it&#x27;s simply yet another way that people are trying to get something for nothing when it comes to health . I&#x27;ve read a lot of the examples of it&#x27;s positive effects. I&#x27;ve read a lot of the raving reviews of people that do this, but I ultimately come to the same conclusion every time I read this stuff... exercise a little bit every day. It&#x27;s healthier than standing all day, it&#x27;s free, doesn&#x27;t require expensive furniture, doesn&#x27;t require you to beg your boss for something expensive and it&#x27;s something you should be doing anyway.<p>I&#x27;m tired of this type of condescension. I guess because the author writes to a community of programmers, or nerds, or whatever, he feels that he can address them as if they are all sloths. I have not had the impression in the overall debate about this standing/sitting business that people are saying that they are going over to a standing desk in order to <i>not</i> exercise. One can perfectly well imagine that the people that are going over to a standing desk because they think that it brings benefits that are a good complement to an overall healthy lifestyle, like eating and exercising properly (I notice that you say that you don&#x27;t eat healthily, deanproxy... does this mean that you willingly do this because you think that an exercise routine can fully compensate for a bad diet...?). If someone vows to try to have better posture in their everyday life, does that mean that they think that it is a replacement for something like a good exercise routing for the back muscles? No. So this is standing/sitting contra exercising is a false dichotomy.<p>In fact, this whole standing/sitting discussion was partly propelled by studies that showed that sitting a lot was bad for ones health, <i>also for active people</i> [0] :<p>> <i></i>Even when adults meet physical activity guidelines, sitting for prolonged periods can compromise metabolic health. <i></i><p>To turn deanproxy&#x27;s baseless condescenscion towards &quot;standers&quot; and their supposed lazyness on its head: deanproxy is simply trying to rationalize his sedentary habits by asserting that having discrete blocks of activity time during the day counteracts his sedentary existence for the rest of the day.<p>To get the whole picture and in order to be in a position to assert that standing is inconsequential, deanproxy should also have experience with a lifestyle in which he exercises and stands/walks/is somewhat active in his day job. But it does not seem that he does. Perhaps not too surprising when his whole argument rests on standing CONTRA exercising in your free time. And what all of this shows is that the zealots (imaginary or not) who vow to NOT exercise BECAUSE they stand during their day jobs are leading an inferior lifestyle because deanproxy exercises and is able to do WITHOUT standing (and eating healthily... ). So deanproxy can claim victory here, the victory of being an exercise-zealot over the standing-zealots.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/</a>",1377727745

Sometimes we can bump that up by a factor of 2-3.  Photovoltaics are <i>much</i> more effecitve, about 20% in production, with theoretical maximums of 40%, which translates to even higher with multi-layer cells.  But that just gets you electricity, not storage.<p>Algae are roughly 10x more productive than plants in converting sunlight to biomass.  Which is pretty useful.  However where a farm is a pretty lightly engineered environment (provide irrigation, even tillage is optional these days), if you&#x27;re going to grow algae, you&#x27;ve got to provide a hell of a lot of services plants otherwise self-service:  support, pest control, nutrient transport, and the like.  Yes, your primary productivity goes up 10x but your capital investments are even higher.  I&#x27;ve followed the field from a distance, and most pilot projects have been abandoned.<p>So instead of harvesting protein from algae and yeast, we get them from acres of soybeans.  It&#x27;s just cheaper.  And the technology is too expensive.<p><i>Population</i><p>Yes, growth rates have declined, but we&#x27;re still dangerously over long-term sustainable levels.  And unfortunately, it&#x27;s <i>poorer</i> areas where kids are most prevalent.

We&#x27;ve had ICBMs for ages.  Navigating through complex terrain (ground-based robots, autonomous vehicles) is a markedly more complex domain space.<p>Most robots we&#x27;ve got at present are very, very highly specialized.  Or incredibly stupid, though good enough for the task at hand.",1377727237

And I would answer, why should the tree be yours just because you got to it first?&quot;<p>The difference is this:  share your tree with me, and there will be only one tree.  Share your ideas with me and we can both think about them, utilize them, and benefit from them.  This idea is self-evident; just as I am communicating it to anyone who reads this post, it was communicated to me by someone else:<p><a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12....</a><p>It is true that creative expression should be valued and that people should be encouraged to be creative.  I would add that society should set up a system where creative workers can derive an income from their work and that such a system will be vital as more and more things are automated.  Property rights are orthogonal to this.  I happen to be a creative worker, but there is no need for me or anyone else to &quot;own&quot; the products of my work; my research group&#x27;s salaries are paid with grant money, because the government wants to encourage the work we do, and we want our work to reach as many eyes as possible.",1377727222

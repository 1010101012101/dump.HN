After Stalin's death, the communist party tried to distance itself from the crimes committed by him. So it's a bit unfair to compare fascism to communism -- you should compare fascism to stalinism instead. In addition, even if you compare fascism to stalinism (both very scary systems), fascism looks a bit worse, not because of the number of people who died, but because unlike stalinism which was mostly a culture of fear, fascism was really a culture of hate all the way down the hierarchy.",1301240446

A perfectly molded extremely hard surface would be very comfortable while you remained perfectly still. Soft tends to be better because it responds to changes in position more readily. But too soft doesn't actually allow a proper distribution of force so hard but yielding is ideal. Hard also resists movements less and since changing positions is another way the body counters excessive pressure, it is ideal for people who utilize this feature.

It, in and of itself, will not make you a better developer. It can do a lot of work for you (frameworks) and make esoteric design patterns easier, but it always comes down to your ability to write structured, maintainable code. PHP makes it easier to hack together scripts. A majority of developers never take the next step in their life and learn the ways to properly structure a website. Chances are, if they do, it's because they've joined another language with the promise of an easier world (Rails, Python) and fail to realize you can do the exact same things in any other language - although it might required a little more understanding of its nuances (PHP).",1301239803

And I also meant Green in the broadest possible sense - as in environmentalists of all denominations. And this context I meant the extremist faction(s) when I said fascist green extremists. Because they only have one agenda: Stop corporations. Stop Nuclear Power. Stop Consuming Carbon power sources. But I don't see an alternative proposal how to deal with everyday human existence in 21st century.<p>Saying renewables have loads of potential just doesn't cut it.<p>In US last nuclear power plant has been built in 1977. Something similar holds true worldwide (there haven't been that many nuclear power plants built since then). Nuclear power production is probably THE most regulated industry in the world (and probably state owned a lot). Newer better  plants haven't been built since, guess who, didn't allow it. These old reactors should be shut down and replaced, but since coal power plants are also not allowed to be built (by guess whom) and there are only that many rivers you can turn into accumulation lakes (not to mention disastrous effect on environment - species are dying out due to hydro power). World is in this weird deadlock where we are forced to expand lifetimes of these old nuclear power stations, just to keep going.<p>And I'm accusing you of being disingenious by pretending that current renewable plans won't have adverse side effects. And by pretending that nuclear industry is in its current state due to greed of plant operators.<p>And you still haven't provided me with an alternative strategy for while we wait for renewables to save us. We have 40 years of burning coal to meet our demands for energy in front of us - whether you accept it or not.

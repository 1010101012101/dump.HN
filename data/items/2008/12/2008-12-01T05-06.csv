They didn't soften things that didn't have to be softened. As a result, I've never felt a fear of the real world. There's nothing mystical or terrifying about it. It's why I moved to the world of start-ups. And I'd strongly suspect that other people here have had similar experiences.",1228110612

381420,comment,379936,380211,0,0,kragen,,,"Like pop songs in that study where they divided people into groups and had them rate songs?  It seems almost inevitable.  That sort of positive feedback can make a system more sensitive, but it can also make it unstable, amplifying noise until it overwhelms small signals.  My third connection is that, if your hypothesis is correct (and I'm pretty sure it is) you would tend to expect comment karma to be distributed according to a Zipf distribution.",1228109703
381419,comment,381254,381254,0,0,tdavis,,,"I've been in this game nearly a decade and I have yet to see a decline in the amount of knowledge still available to gain. Learning one thing seems to have the tendency to present 10 more learning opportunities for my troubles. My philosophy is, if I find myself in a job where there isn't much more I can learn, it's time to find a new job. Or a new career. Or perhaps just a new hobby.<p>I don't know many web developers who are strictly that. Most web developers have other programming-related passions so in the event that they somehow ""master"" web development, there are countless other forms of programming to learn. Something tells me I'll be doing this for a long time. That, or I'll become a Monk. I have always enjoyed the quiet and I hear they take vows of silence.",1228109574

It kinda goes with the (unwritten) convension that a method's first parameter is always the longest so that the rest of the parameters align well with the colon character.<p>And I don't think you can always rely on code-formatters.  There are always cases when you need to manually format a piece of code to make it look more sensible.",1228109533

381412,comment,381360,381402,0,0,mhartl,,,"That's basically right.  I'd make it a bit more precise by noting that the anchor in the boat displaces a volume of water whose weight is equal to the anchor's weight (Archimedes' Principle); call this <i>V_1</i>.  When in the water, the anchor simply displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume; call this <i>V_2</i>. Since the anchor is denser than water, <i>V_1</i> > <i>V_2</i>, so the level of the lake goes down when the anchor gets thrown in the water.<p>Also, you need to replace ""it's"" with ""its"" in your solution.  (In 2005, I edited the <i>Definitive and Extended Edition of The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> for physics content <i>and</i> for spelling/grammar.  Could you tell? :-)",1228109050

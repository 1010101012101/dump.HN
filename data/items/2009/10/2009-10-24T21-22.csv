Also I quite enjoy finding unexpected things that I didn't even know I'd be interested in.<p>I'm an information junkie, what can I say.<p>I DO know quite well what I'm NOT interested in though. Very few solutions let me filter out crap I'm NOT interested in. I think that approach would work the best for me.<p>I wish information I read was accurately classified using some standard metadata conventions. It'd be so much easier to deal with. Obviously with the sheer volume of data, and the diversity of the sources, that's probably completely impossible to do in any reasonable way. Still, I wonder, if a popular RSS platform would implement some sort of standard, and then let their sources come on board if they wished to...I wonder how quickly it'd be adopted.",1256421138

It had no engines of its own, it could carry a larger payload. Another nice touch was that it could be mounted on top of the booster instead of its side, preventing Columbia-like accidents. And it was fully automated - the only time it flew, was unmanned.<p>Truly a great piece of equipment. Very impressive.",1256420141

Junkflash is a new way to access celebrity news. The Junkflash browser add-in recognizes and tags up celebrities you come across while browsing. When you point at a celebrity name a sidebar appears showing the latest published headlines about that person. These are aggregated from the feeds of 50 top celebrity news sites.<p>Why is it cool?
Junkflash users doesn't have to search sites or clear out feeds to find gossip they’re interested in, Junkflash brings relevant celebrity news to the context of your browsing. When shopping for movies or music, watching clips on YouTube or reading a movie review and a celebrity is mentioned, Junkflash shows you the latest gossip about that person right there and then!<p>And when you're already at a celebrity news site, Junkflash lets you see other sites angle on a story, or more recent developments.<p>“Junkflash brings gossip closer to gossip fans.”",1256419303

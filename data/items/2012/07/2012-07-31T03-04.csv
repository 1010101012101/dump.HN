E.g. with a custom component, you see a gray rect instead of how things are laid out, and you'd still need to write the custom bits in code anyway. Now you have the mess in 2 places.<p>There's also other reasons like version control, being able to copy-n-paste, using constants, etc.",1343707184

In these ads, the genius is more amiable.<p>Let's not forget the generation of 'Switcher' ads that had Ellen ""beep, beep, beep"" Feiss. Apple ads have varied in tone and focus from year-to-year: you can't feature archetypes against a white background forever, as any look will get dated over time.<p>(Maybe some of the future genius-helping-outside-the-store ads can feature cameos of previous ad actors...

Yes, there is a set of habits and probabilities of certain responses to various scenarios, but I contend that the mental model of ""character"" (as it is normally understood in Western culture) is a poor predictor because it groups together certain situational responses with labels that have no necessary underlying correlation to validate them.<p>My own judgement when interviewing job candidates mostly comes down to technical depth. I'm primarily interested in competence and demonstrated ability to deal with and get results in a complex technological system. I'm not really interested at all in CV buzzwords - and that's what most of those bullet lists end up being, tags to try and get through HR filters.

However, if they bypassed their target they were not allowed to dispose of their load on Vietnam terriroty.

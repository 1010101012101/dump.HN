If the messages were just queued in a simple database table instead, the implementations would have been much easier to work with: easier setup and admin (it&#x27;s just part of the existing database), easier to check and monitor (just select counts from the table), easier to inspect the pending messages and fix problematic messages. In all cases I get the feeling the architects were just looking for an excuse to use a new technology.<p>I can only see high-load scenarios as a possible justification, where the volume of incoming message data is physically too much for the RDMS.",1396173591

7495706,comment,7493856,7493856,2,0,pron,,,"I&#x27;d like to make what might probably be an unpopular suggestion, but I&#x27;ll make it nonetheless :)<p>Perhaps you should simply block all comments on those stories that are likely to cause some &quot;nonconstructive&quot; (I don&#x27;t really like the term) controversy or those whose subject has already been discussed on other stories, rather than killing them (dropping them from the front page, that is).<p>The reason I&#x27;m offering this is because of an argument I had with dang (gruseom) about a week ago over a story that expressed a very clear political opinion (which was particularly pertinent to HN). The reason it&#x27;s important for these stories to be featured on the front page is that much of what is done in Silicon Valley is extremely political – from Uber to the latest GitHub scandal. I completely understand the desire for HN to stay away from politics, but that&#x27;s not the result. <i>Seemingly</i> shying away from politics is itself a very powerful political statement, which is often apparent to anyone reading HN when something important is going on. It either communicates that you don&#x27;t understand what politics is and your role in it, reduces the role of engineers to that of mere technicians at the same time most of them claim to be the exact opposite, or sends a message of silent agreement with the status quo. In fact, this was one of the main points of that killed story.<p>Just as an example – unrelated to that particular argument – featuring stories about Uber&#x27;s success while dropping stories expressing outrage over their practices either expresses agreement with their behavior or a lack of understanding of how political is everything they do. &quot;Outrage&quot; over Uber isn&#x27;t any less &quot;constructive&quot; <i>or political</i> than a discussion of, say, how much money they&#x27;re making and how.<p>HN isn&#x27;t /r/programming. It is not a technical discussion site (although it is that, too), but one for all things SV or hacker-related, including the effect of technology on society and vice-versa. As such, HN can&#x27;t hide from political discussions over those very issues.<p>But because &quot;political&quot; stories can and often do generate heated and sometimes bigoted debates, it might be best to conserve the site&#x27;s desired collegial atmosphere by simply banning comments on certain stories. Dropping them from the front page sends a clear message that leaves a very bad taste in many of the readers. Letting them be, but prohibiting debate in the comments says: this is an important opinion that many of our readers think you should be exposed to. Read it or not as you wish, or post an opposite thoughtful opinion, but don&#x27;t bicker over it.",1396173091

7495696,comment,7494360,7494360,1,0,Isofarro,,,"Probably the first of only two occurrences where Kasparov&#x27;s ego-based self-belief collapsed. That mysterious rook move in a drawn endgame spooked him, and seeded the doubt.<p>Doubt is a costly thing in tournament conditions, doubt about the opponent leads to doubt in your own ability to predict your opponent&#x27;s moves. So you start looking at more candidate moves at each branch of analysis, and also you start rechecking lines again -- all against the candidate move approach. All this costs time and effort, and tires you down quicker. So weaker patches of play become more regular, unless you buckle down and keep it under control, another source of energy leak.<p>And over a series of games, in trying to hold that back, Kasparov probably eased off a little in the last game, and committed perhaps the worst blunder of his career, in a line he knew very very well from the other side of the board.<p>The second time Kasparov&#x27;s self-belief collapsed was the Braingames World Championship match with Kramnik. But this was less to do with being spooked, and more with the evidence his opponent was far more prepared - perhaps for the first time in Kasparov&#x27;s career.<p>Kasparov wears his emotions on his sleeve. A lot of his incredible conceptions are a display of his aggressive creativity and stamina. An emotional battle is one core part of Kasparov&#x27;s armoury, along with well-prepared innovations and surprises, and his capacity to find aggressive moves that keep his opponent off balance.<p>I am so impressed for how long Kasparov has kept his game together. Right up to his last tournament in 2006, 25 years playing chess of such quality and magnificence. When others junior to him faded and burned out around him - Shirov, and perhaps recently Morozevic.<p>And Kasparov, like all chess players, needed to find reasons, external reasons, to explain the failure. In the Deeper Blue match, the paranoia of not seeing analysis printouts from the machine prompted the suggestion that the IBM team were hiding something, like a human grandmaster making that move. It&#x27;s necessary in the make-up of a chess player to find an external reason, because otherwise it is a clear demonstration of fallibility in tense situations.<p>(The book &quot;The Inner Game&quot; about Nigel Short&#x27;s path to challenge Garry Kasparov in 1993, talks a bit about how chess players need to put disasters out of their mind, to be able to play the next game in the match. That ability allowed Short to come out in the next game and sometime produce amazing moves and pushed Kasparov, despite the heavy losses.)<p>The interesting part of the Deeper Blue match isn&#x27;t that the computer won the last game, but the human factors of that mysterious rook move right at the start of the match. It set off an emotional reaction in Kasparov, which lead to the spectacular collapse in the last game.<p>Interesting too is how Kasparov somehow overcame this collapse. Somehow the effects of this disaster didn&#x27;t seem to affect the rest of his playing strength. He somehow regained complete confidence in himself.<p>I don&#x27;t think his match loss to Kramnik was affected by this, Kasparov was just outthought, outplayed, and out prepared by a better player. Kramnik rose to a fantastic level to win that match. Kramnik&#x27;s fitness for one, was impressive considering his past lifestyle.",1396172569

Devs can vary a lot, I find skills rare among UI / design types, even those (most nowadays) using Macs, and for administrative / project management types, it&#x27;s often very little.  Based largely on casual observation, mind.<p>The other point is that specificity of knowledge can very <i>greatly</i>, and IT is <i>all</i> about specialization.  Even people who are good at multiple tools often have their limits, and I&#x27;ll see specialization in development, databases, networking, build/release management, QA, systems development (as opposed to app or UI work), and related specialties such as networking and others.  Specific skillsets too are often accidents of opportunity and history -- having moved through a specific shop or acquired a particular skill is very much dependent on where you&#x27;ve been, much less a mark of innate ability.<p>One recent team I worked with had access to a set of highly complementary talents:  very strong systems knowledge, database, overall app and enterprise architecture, and a networking consultant.  Resolving a number of issues and enhancements turned out to rely very much on each individual&#x27;s strengths, where what any given member could provide by way of easily accomplished tasks (seconds or less) would have set the rest of the team hours or days.<p>What I find particularly damaging is environments in which expertise is guarded while at the same time begrudging others for what they didn&#x27;t know (and not providing for knowledge transfer) generally leads to negative engagements.

The comments from previous workmates give the sense that this was a <i>nice</i> place to work.<p>Here is a puzzle...<p>In my old pre-ubiquitous-computing physics lab we did something similar to the system described in the OA with a large piece of graph paper and a collection of coloured pens. It was called the Who Buys Next Chart.<p>We made our own coffee and tea, you understand. Axes were drawn with number of cups made along the bottom and money up the side. A thick black line of gradient equal to the average cost per cup was drawn(1). Each member had a different colour pen.<p>When you made a drink you extended your line along an amount equal to the number of drinks. When you bought something you extended your plot with a vertical line equal to the amount you spent. Equitable contributions implied a plot approaching the thick black line.<p>When we ran out of a crucial ingredient, the person whose plot had reached furthest left below the line (i.e. who had made the most drinks but not bought much) had to go and buy the stuff.<p>The system was gamed in various ways - or more accurately various strategies evolved to avoid having to go out in the rain and various issues about equitable contribution arose.<p>Can you spot some of the more obvious ones?<p>(1) The gradient was determined by the accumulated result from the previous WBNC. This tradition had been in place for some years, and a large sheet of graph paper lasted for a couple of months.",1396171278

I was surprised and upset when I first heard the news, too. However, from Facebook&#x27;s perspective and the perspective of anyone who cares about having better long distance social experiences or virtual reality experiences, it&#x27;s a great move. I am sure VR will be primarily used in games, and the tech will be perfected on games, but it has real value in so many other realms. All these assumptions I keep hearing (and those in the article) about how it is going to turn into Second Life style &quot;Metaverse&quot;  or whatever is just cynical. Sure, it could turn into that, and be as pernicious as you can imagine. But alternate possibilities are that I could replace Skype, which is awkward for my mother to use, and I could actually go sit in my living room across the ocean and have a conversation with her. That would be amazing.<p>If all you can see for VR platforms is games/metaverse, then you aren&#x27;t thinking far enough ahead.

Columnist Edward Limonov, the 66-year-old political provocateur in whom the Federal Service officials were particularly interested, filed his copy from prison for two years after being convicted of possessing arms, which he admits he intended to smuggle into Kazakhstan in an effort to incite a coup there. Writer Kevin McElwee, an American expatriate, had both legs broken when he was torn from the side of a building he was scaling to escape an angry mob of Muscovites, an incident that had nothing to do with anything he’d written—McElwee, The Exile’s film reviewer, was just a rambunctious drunk. On another occasion, a deranged and slighted man sent a letter promising to kill the “frat boy” Ames. Ames in turn published an editorial urging the loon to instead off his co-editor, Matt Taibbi. True, the many death threats Ames received took less of a physical toll on him than loading up on Viagra and attempting to bed nine Moscow prostitutes in nine hours, which he wrote about to commemorate The Exile’s ninth anniversary, but that was only because Ames approached the assignment with a rigor befitting a Consumer Reports exposé—“There really was no other way to tell whether these drugs actually worked,” he recalls with sincerity and audible exhaustion.<p>[...]<p>> But far more dangerous in Putin’s Russia was The Exile’s serious journalism. By the time it was shuttered, the paper had published damning views of Russian life through three administrations, two wars, and a stock-market crash, ever since the freezing February night in 1997 when, penniless and infuriatingly sober, Ames had put out the first issue in a torrent of outrage at the sharpies and frauds who insisted that post-Communist Russia was a new democratic paradise, at the liars in the Kremlin, the dreamers in Washington, the academic careerists, Wall Street, the World Bank, the idiots in the press who’d never hired him—at pretty much everyone save Ames himself. Never mind that he and Taibbi would prove the hardest-partying Moscow media celebrities of their time, never mind that they wouldn’t just expose the place’s hedonism but come to embody it—Ames was pissed off. He wasn’t George Plimpton chasing Hemingway’s Sad Young Men as part of some romantic lost generation. He was living in the unromantic rubble of a lost empire.<p>> “Everything was about free markets and capitalism and democracy, and it was all leading us to some great new future, but all you had to do was look around in the streets and see there was something fucking wrong with it,” Ames says. “We were in the middle of total devastation, one of the worst, most horrible fucking tragedies of modern times.”<p>> Ames was from the start vindictive, and carping, and paranoid, and, in the opinion of Exile devotees, a group that includes many of its victims, he also happened to be right.<p>> “They were incredibly gutsy,” former Moscow-bureau chief of The Economist Edward Lucas says. Ames once devoted a cover story to deriding Lucas’s reporting, and The Exile panned his book, but nonetheless Lucas read the paper regularly. “There was kind of a suspension of disbelief in the 1990s—it may be corrupt, but it will work. The Exile spotted very perceptively that the most optimistic Western interpretation was wrong.”<p>> “They were very direct and visceral and often very scurrilous, but they caught a side of Moscow that no one else did,” Owen Matthews, currently Moscow-bureau chief for Newsweek, says. “They didn’t feel the need to hedge around with reportorial politesse,” and Ames is “a great stylist. I don’t compare him to Céline lightly. He has that quality of brutal honesty.” This from a man whom Ames repeatedly savaged in print, once describing his teeth as leaning “randomly like Celtic temple ruins.” Still, he’s an admirer. “I haven’t seen a newspaper that’s so breathtakingly dark and cynical and brilliant,” Matthews says. “They had something going that really couldn’t be repeated anywhere. It would be out of business in three seconds if they tried to publish it in the U.S.”<p>> “They took me on for using journalistic clichés, and at the end of the day I was like, ‘You know what? You’re right,’” says Colin McMahon, a former Moscow-bureau chief for the Chicago Tribune, adding, “I read it because it was good for story ideas, frankly. These guys were deeper into a subculture of Moscow than I could ever have allowed myself to be. I’d see something in The Exile and say, ‘How can I get this into a story without mainlining cocaine?’”<p>[1] <a href=""http://exiledonline.com/exposing-the-familiar-rightwing-pr-machine-is-cnbcs-rick-santelli-sucking-koch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exiledonline.com/exposing-the-familiar-rightwing-pr-m...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://exiledonline.com/vanity-fair-profiles-the-exile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exiledonline.com/vanity-fair-profiles-the-exile/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/02/exile-201002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/02/exile-201...</a>",1396170824

While this accessory is fundamentally the n'th generation descendant of the 1970s console game controller. I'm kind of annoyed, because if this catches on it will potentially cost us a raft of new user interface innovations by allowing lazy back-ports of console titles instead of forcing developers to confront the inherent strengths and weaknesses of an entirely new and different way of doing things.

Mainly that created by weaselly coworkers trying to get ahead and establish technical superiority in the eyes of the non-techie management.  These people never write any code themselves but are the first to start WTF'ing really loudly when someone else completes something.  Usually the volume and banality of things programmers complain about identify their technical competence, with the bottom of the barrel being complaints about whitespace and formatting. ""WTF! Bob put TWO spaces instead of ONE all after method names all over the ENTIRE file! whaaah!""  Yes, it becomes this petty with some people.<p>So a smart programmer will strive for 'quick perfection', establish respect in some other way to counter this, or if they really want to sink that low, fight back with similar tactics.  Smart programmers can also create review traps if they can guess what colleagues will attack them on.<p>Its also good if you beat up another programmer on the first day so the others know not to mess with you ;).",1325451452

3413819,comment,3413379,3413561,0,0,kijin,,,"It seems that the thesis that Stone abandoned (according to your third link) was about love in marriage, not about the increasing awareness of children's nature. He may have had multiple theses, not all of which he abandoned.<p>The idea that Western societies' perception of children went from ""miniature adult"" to ""distinct category of human"" in the 16th and 17th century is not an unusual theory among Renaissance scholars. It might not be the most accurate description of what happened, but its credibility is not as suspicious as you seem to think it is. Art historians regularly appeal to this theory, not only in English contexts, but also when talking about Italian art and the rest of Renaissance.<p>My sister (an art history major) wrote an honors paper on Titian a couple of years ago, focusing on how the artist's portrayal of children changed over the decades. There are transitions that cannot be explained simply by saying ""He was just trying to paint more realistically"". For example, the context, setting, composition, props, etc. of this painting (<a href=""http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&p=c&a=p&ID=9732"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&p=c&a=p&#...</a>), when analyzed with the usual tools of art historians and compared to other paintings of children, suggest that at least part of the transition involved a shift in the concept of a child. The way in which similar portrayals spread throughout Europe in the following decades also supports the theory that this new concept was being rapidly adopted and developed. (I'm not an art historian so I can't explain this very well, but I'm sure there are many scholarly sources for this.) Artists might not have invented the new concept of a child, but they were certainly responding to it -- and Renaissance artists were often the first to respond to the latest philosophical developments of their times.",1325451172

And still, there are many libraries that have yet to be ported to Python 3. These deficiencies make Python 3 an impossible choice for some tasks. The slow adoption of Python 3 is not without reason as many have pointed out, although Armin Ronacher's recent blog post[1] stands out as one of the better illustrations of the frustrations with Python 3. I have to say, as a Pythonista, I am worried about Python. I wonder if things will become increasingly fragmented...<p>[1] <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/</a>",1325449549

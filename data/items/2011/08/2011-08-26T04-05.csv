I don't like what is happening but If it was me I wouldn't have OSS'd the project. Just that risk you take.<p>I really don't see morals ever stop anyone from trying to make a buck on the internet. Spammers, Mac defender scams, Big copy cat companies (you know, the guys that just go right out and wget your entire site recursively), Groupon (had to throw that one in), or whatever else you got. Nuts I tell you.<p>I hate to say it, but no one is going to remember you for OSS'ing or even forking a project. So it can go either way for both groups.<p>In the end people are only going remember the one that make the most noise (functionality, service, even drama).

2927378,story,,,5,6,ashraful,"Ask HN: Anyone want to help me build a browser?",,"I posted the idea for a browser on my blog a few days ago, you read about it here:<p>http://ashraful.org/introducing-browsr/
http://ashraful.org/browser-features/<p>Unfortunately, the programmer working on this left. So I am looking for a someone to take over the lead development. If you happen to be a desktop programmer and are interested in this, please email me at inlith@gmail.com<p>For your convenience, here are the three main features (copy pasted from the second blog post):<p>AUTOMATIC SIGN-UP<p>If you have been using the internet for any length of time, chances are you have signed-up for more than one website. In fact, you probably signed up for more than a dozen. Whether its an email service, a social network, a forum or simply a blog, users have to Sign Up or Register on each website separately, often providing the same data to to each and and every one of them. Browsr hopes to eliminate this by using its built-in identity manager to automatically sign-up and sign-in users.<p>When the user first launches Browsr they fill up their profile with all their personal information. Now whenever the user visits a website that requires registration, instead of asking the user, the website can ask the browser for the information needed. Browsr provides the data based on the identity selected by the user, and so the user never sees the registration form. Instead everything takes place between the browser and the website, and user is automatically signed in without having to worry about the sign-up process.<p>In the identity manager, users can choose the edit the data provided to a specific web services, move the service to another identity or remove it entirely.<p>NATIVE APPS WITH OFFLINE ACCESS<p>Do you have any website that you visit regularly? Isnt it a waste of bandwidth, and more importantly your time, to load the same website interface again and again? After all, all you really want is the new email you received or the updates from your friends. Using native apps, Browsr eliminates the wasteful nature of downloading the same website interface repeatedly.<p>In the Home screen, users can install apps the same way they do on their iPhones or iPads. Adding an app is simple as click the + button and searching for the desired app and clicking Install. Apps are not simply bookmarks, they are full-fledged applications that you can use instantly. When you install the app for a particular web service you no longer have to load the entire website, all you download is the new data  like your facebook messages or tweets from your friends. And best of all, you dont need to connect to the internet to gain access to your data, you can read all your old messages, or browse all your photos while youre offline.<p>LOCALLY STORED, PERFECTLY MOBILE DATA<p>Nowadays almost any website you use has a lot of information about you. Google knows your search history, Microsoft has your emails, Facebook has your social graph and photos, Last.FM has your music history, Foursquare has your check-ins. And even though you are the owner, you cannot take your data with you.<p>You should be able to take your search history from Google with you, so you can use Bing and still get relevant results. You should be able to take your photos with you from Facebook to Google Plus so you can share it with your friends.  You should be able to take your emails from Hotmail to Gmail so you can search through it more easily. And most importantly you should have the right to deny access to your data to any web service.<p>Browsr tries to provide you with complete control over your data by storing all our information locally. Instead of storing your information on some server that you dont have access to, all of it is stored on your PC. And you can do whatever you want with it: back it up, put it on Dropbox, or provide access to any web service you choose.  Having control over your data means you can quickly get started with new web services you want to use, with all your past data right there with you.<p>On top of that, Browsr also lets you keep your social connections with you by using the identity manager. Your entire social graph stays with you regardless of  what social network you are using.",1314332718

You're dying!"".<p>The reason for this is because unrestricted free speech is very important, and some day it may become vital for you be able to speak in a way that hurts people's feelings. Therefore they do not restrict emotionally hurtful free-speech in the law. (except in cases where it overlaps with other considerations...but don't lets get too bogged down here.)<p>However I think we can all agree that it would be an incredibly shitty thing to do.<p>Software licenses in that respect are like the law. They are there to lay out practical matters. The reason for allowing forking is because the ability to do it in certain circumstances is important....if a product is abandoned or what-have-you, a fork can save it.<p>However, just like hurting someone's feelings forking is something to be avoided unless truly necessary. (obviously this is somewhat subjective). In that regard, the blog author is 100% right. Forks are stigmatized (in some communities) and this is how it should be for a variety of reasons both practical and social. Forking without a good reason is something of a Jerk move.<p>Some people seem to think if you release under a fork-permissive license it somehow welcomes all fork-related behaviour and I think it's a shame. I would say this is no more true than publishing your phone number is an invitation for mean-spirited prank-calls. Sure they will happen, and one should expect them (or at least not be surprised), but that's an entirely separate question from whether or not they are a morally or socially acceptable thing.<p>I would note however that I'm not familiar with this particular situation at all, and it could be the forkers DO have a good reason. In that case it's unfortunate, but that's the reality....sometimes you want or need to take a project in a certain direction and the project founders won't cooperate. In that case I would say a fork is justified.<p>I don't even think the bar for ""justified fork"" should be very high, but it's definitely higher than ""the license allows forks""...and I think we should always fork reluctantly. It should be viewed as the slightly less desirable option.",1314332383

That's why we distribute all the source code to be able to do it.  But also keep in mind this is the Yahoo CDN, if it goes down, all of Yahoo goes down.  I can't say the CDN won't ever go down, but to my knowledge, it has never happened.<p>If you are concerned about CDN reliability, for optimal performance I would still use the Yahoo CDN as you get all the benefits of combo-handling, edge-caching, and (soon) server-side dependency calculation.  And as a backup, host on your own CDN in the unlikely event Yahoo's CDN goes down.<p>We'll look into passing the <C-F> test. :)",1314332166

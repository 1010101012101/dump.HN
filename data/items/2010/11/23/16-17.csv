Transportation accounts for only 11% of the environmental impact of food[1], so that's not a first-order approximation of the true cost at all.

It's true that it's a myth that scholars in Columbus's time thought the earth was round, but the sphericity of the earth was certainly was not known for the past eight thousand years worldwide, nor was it even common knowledge among non-scholars in Columbus's time (as evidenced by the fact that artistic depictions of a flat earth were common).<p>Wikipedia:<p>> The Flat Earth model is a view that the Earth's shape is a flat plane or disk. Most pre-modern cultures have had conceptions of a flat Earth, including ancient Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Ancient Near East until the Hellenistic period, Ancient India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD) and China until the 17th century. It was also typically held in the cultures of the New World until the time of European contact, and a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in pre-scientific societies.[1]\nThe paradigm of a spherical Earth was developed in ancient Greek astronomy, beginning with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most Pre-Socratics retained the flat Earth model. Aristotle accepted the spherical shape of the Earth on empirical grounds around 330 BC, and knowledge of the spherical Earth gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world from then on.[2][3][4][5]\nThe misconception that educated people at the time of Columbus believed in a flat Earth has been referred to as ""The Myth of the Flat Earth"".[6] In 1945, it was listed by the Historical Association (of Britain) as the second of 20 in a pamphlet on common errors in history",1290530679

1934224,comment,1933889,1933981,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"The ""force"" of gravity is not a fundamental concept in general relativity.<p>Here's a way of thinking about what's going on.<p>Consider a large mass, like the Earth.  That mass curves spacetime in the vicinity of the Earth.  A small object, like a satellite, simply moves completely freely in a ""straight line"" (i.e., geodesic path) according to that curved geometry.  The curved geometry is such that those geodesics are just the satellite orbits that we see.  In other words, the satellite isn't affected by any ""force"", it's just moving in a straight line in a geometry that happens to be curved, so we see it doing circles around the Earth.<p>It's exceedingly neat: in John Wheeler's great phrase, matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move.  No forces required!  Of course, after the fact you can tack on a notion of ""force"", but it's in no way fundamental.<p>Same thing is going on with projectile motion here on Earth.<p>Once you internalize this point of view, the statement about holding your arm in place becomes a lot clearer.  The ""natural"" force-free thing your arm wants to do is to move along geodesics of spacetime, which means falling toward the Earth at an acceleration of g.  But if we exert a (muscular) force to keep it up, then we can hold it in place.  In short, in this point of view, forces are things which cause deviations from geodesic motion.",1290530085

1934182,comment,1933192,1933192,0,0,jwr,,,"This is quite interesting. I wonder how capable the platform will be. The article doesn't have many details, unfortunately.<p>Several years ago I was looking for a chip we could use in a set-top box design. We wanted low-power high-performance H.264 decoding. We talked to a very interesting company â Stretch Inc. (<a href=""http://stretchinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stretchinc.com/</a>), they've been developing something similar for many years now. They basically have a CPU with a tightly-integrated FPGA within.<p>Problem is, the devil is in the details. While FPGAs can theoretically provide impressive acceleration, what ends up mattering is whether you can get them data to process fast enough, what the latencies are, what the interfaces are, and how much easily-accessible memory you have on the FPGA die. That's for the easier algorithms which are mostly CPU-bound.<p>For memory-bound algorithms what really matters is the DMA engine. That is something Intel never got right, which is why you see Texas Instruments DSPs in most embedded applications. If you want to have predictable high-throughput data processing, you need to be in control of your caches. That means a multichannel DMA engine that lets you schedule reads ahead of time and precisely control what is in your L1/L2 at any given time. The ubiquitous n-way set associative caches are great for general-purpose code, but end up being wildly unpredictable for DSP-type stuff.<p>Another factor with FPGAs is how quickly they can be reconfigured â how quickly can you switch the code inside? Can you use the FPGA for several parts of your data pipeline, or does the reconfiguration take so long that it becomes impractical to switch?<p>So, I will be very interested in what the details are â but for the moment color me skeptical. It took Stretch many years to get to a well-designed architecture and even that wasn't right for all purposes. And Intel isn't known for experience with DSPs, which really matters here.<p>Note I didn't even mention compiler support, OS support and how the FPGA is actually to be programmed. I consider those to be secondary to actual hardware performance.",1290529510

Given the target market for hosting, Fremont's a pretty good option.<p>2) Depending on the service, a datacenter is only as useful as the transit providers you can access.  We do all our hosting at a Chicago facility where we can get a cross connect to any bandwidth provider you can think of.  Our services are also targeted at end users, so we're better off being centrally located and using providers with extensive peering agreements (less latency, woo!).  If we had serious computation requirements rather than delivery requirements, one of those spiff Icelandic datacenters might be a good choice.  I'm unsure of what Google and others stick in their rural datacenters, but I doubt it's anything that slows down your experience.",1290529128

This really still re-enforces factory farmed meat because it acts like the only meat choice is factory farmed. If the choice is between the environmentally destructive technique- grain fed factory meat or sustainably raised grass-fed meat, that would actually make the meat situation better.",1290528254

If a political entity decides in favor of war and there is conscription, individuals can't legally refuse if they disagree. Sure, aggressive wars can be waged with professional armies, but then at least there is the possibility of opting out.<p>In the case of defensive war, there are two options: take refuge or take up arms. Sometimes, the refugee option is better. If you're a married man, your first responsibility should be toward the safety of your family. If that means running away, that is indeed the better option.<p>Learning to defend oneself and one's family should be a primary responsibility. But I'm not sure the army is the only means to achieve that.<p>---<p>As an aside, in a country with conscription there would be no civilians. If all able-bodied men/women are expected to serve in the military, they are fair game according to the rules of war. Conscription is one of the things that makes total war possible. Without conscripts, the war machine will eventually run out of money. With conscripts, the state can wage war up to the point of self-destruction.",1290528092
1934072,comment,1933514,1933734,0,0,Locke1689,,,"This is tricky because you're also making a false comparison. Specifically, you're comparing between ""you"" and ""older you."" I would agree that in almost every conceivable case that ""older you"" is more competent and resourceful than younger you. The problem is that the comparison isn't necessarily between ""you"" and ""older you""; instead it could be between ""younger you"" and some other set of programmers. There are a decent amount of good, young programmers and a really large amount of bad programmers.<p>Also, generic ""experience"" is a false dichotomy. For example, if we were both given the problem ""write a hardware accelerated virtual machine monitor kernel"" I would probably run rings around you. Why? Because I have experience in that subdomain. If we were given a problem that focused more on your subdomain the situation would be reversed. Experience isn't black and white and there are some situations, like kernel development, where I'd probably be as good a choice as someone who never learned C but is a great Java developer.<p>In other words, strictly age is a false comparison and making such naive comparisons is practically guaranteed to land you with someone unsuited for a specific problem.",1290528061

All of my in-car music is played from my smartphone. I don't even remember when I last heard the radio.<p>For new artists, there's nothing that can beat online music services giving personalized recommendations based on your own preferences (or even based on what's popular). A generic radio presenter can't even come close.<p>As for the news, what's happening, closed roads, etc. I can get all that info online and skim across it in seconds, rather than having fragments of information trickle down from a radio presenter between songs and commercials.<p>I understand it's your area of work, but there is no way FM radio will ever survive in it's current format as we move forward.",1325357957

3411536,comment,3409906,3411231,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I think there is potential in having a second chamber where the people making decisions serve a long term in office (possibly until they choose to retire) unless they are actively recalled. As you say, that puts them above the need to make decisions based on the worst kind of reactionary politics, as often happens to those serving for terms of only a few years who always have one eye on the re-election campaign fund.<p>On the other hand, I think getting into such office in the first place should be about more than buttering up the current PM. Rather like the US Supreme Court, if all you have to do to reach such high office is receive the assent of someone who may themselves be on the way out politically by the time they appoint you, there is a very real danger that too many bad apples get in and then can't readily be removed.<p>I've often mused idly over the jury service for politicians idea. For a while, I wondered what would happen if we ran a staged process where randomly selected citizens were invited to join the second chamber for one term of office, lasting quite a while (say 6 years), with a new intake every other year so you never have a chamber full of people who haven't figured out how things work yet. The difficulty I always run into is that like jury service, it probably has to be compulsory rather than an invitation if you're going to get a reasonably representative group, but unlike jury service it is clearly not reasonable to require people to give up several years of their lives for public service. And you can't really do it on shorter terms of say one year, because then the administration of the day can just wait out a hostile second chamber and hope for better luck next time before steamrollering through all the bad legislation it really wants in one favourable year.",1325357884

3411531,comment,3410773,3410773,0,0,balloot,,,"I don't get what it is about software engineers that make so many of them think they're entitled to work remotely.<p>It seems to start with the fact that many engineers think 100% of their job is coding, and therefore they can get ""more"" work done when working remotely.  This is absolutely dead wrong.  Engineers also should be accomplishing the following in order to maximize overall productivity:<p>- teaching other engineers<p>- learning from other engineers<p>- coordinating engineering tasks to minimize duplication<p>- doing what is necessary to ensure the software is what is needed<p>- communicating with others any insights that may be had while developing<p>- working with other departments to make sure everything is in place to build whatever it is you're building.<p>This is just what I can come up with off the top of my head in 2 minutes, and each of these things takes a significant hit when the engineer is working remotely.  Any engineer I would want to hire has quite a bit more to offer than coding skills, and as soon as you require more than a basic automaton blindly building a product exactly to spec, you need human interaction with that person to maximize potential.  We already learned this lesson a few years ago with the total failure of ""all software can be outsourced to India!""  I don't see why we need to learn this again.",1325357788
3411530,comment,3411091,3411450,0,0,biot,,,"I found the ruling to be an interesting read which went to lengths to distinguish idea from expression. It even referenced an older case of Atari vs. Amusement World (Asteroids vs. Meteors) which Atari lost:<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579&q=Atari,+Inc.+v.+Amusement+World,+Inc.&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064...</a><p>A notable quote from that case:<p><pre><code>  It seems clear that defendants based their game on plaintiff's 
  copyrighted game; to put it bluntly, defendants took plaintiff's 
  idea. However, the copyright laws do not prohibit this. Copyright 
  protection is available only for expression of ideas, not for ideas 
  themselves. Defendants used plaintiff's idea and those portions of 
  plaintiff's expression that were inextricably linked to that idea. 
  The remainder of defendants' expression is different from plaintiff's 
  expression. Therefore, the Court finds that defendants' ""Meteors"" 
  game is not substantially similar to and is not an infringing 
  copy of plaintiff's ""Asteroids"" game.
</code></pre>
The Munchkin ruling also references an older case and quotes:<p><pre><code>  Thus, ""if the only similarity between plaintiff's and defendant's 
  works is that of the abstract idea, there is an absence of substantial 
  similarity and hence no infringement results.""
</code></pre>
It later goes on to say:<p><pre><code>  Plaintiffs' audiovisual work is primarily an unprotectible game, but 
  unlike the bee pin, to at least a limited extent the particular
  form in which it is expressed (shapes, sizes, colors, sequences,
  arrangements, and sounds) provides something ""new or additional 
  over the idea.""
</code></pre>
This was to be North American's downfall:<p><pre><code>  North American not only adopted the same basic characters but also 
  portrayed them in a manner which made K. C. Munchkin appear 
  substantially similar to PAC-MAN. The K. C. Munchkin gobbler 
  has several blatantly similar features, including the relative 
  size and shape of the ""body,"" the V-shaped ""mouth,"" its distinctive 
  gobbling action (with appropriate sounds), and especially the way in 
  which it disappears upon being captured. An examination of the K. C. 
  Munchkin ghost monsters reveals even more significant visual 
  similarities. In size, shape, and manner of movement, they are virtually 
  identical to their PAC-MAN counterparts. K. C. Munchkin's monsters, 
  for example, exhibit the same peculiar ""eye"" and ""leg"" movement. 
  Both games, moreover, express the role reversal and ""regeneration"" 
  process with such great similarity that an ordinary observer 
  could conclude only that North American copied plaintiffs' PAC-MAN.
</code></pre>
Had they only copied the idea the case would have gone the way of the Asteroids vs. Meteors case. Where they went wrong is that they copied the expressions used to such a degree that it was found to be infringing their copyright.",1325357783

Remove your finger from the ""auto downvote any critic of Paul"" mode for a second and stop to understand this point: Ron Paul is supporting anti-gay discrimination.<p>Answer me this: suppose we lived in a world where black people were banned from going onto public roads. There were multiple votes to make it legal for black people to use public roads. Ron Paul voted against those attempts multiple times, saying ""I'm not racist, but I believe that public roads shouldn't exist as they're an inappropriate use of public funds."" So the status quo remains indefinitely, as there's no actual chance that public roads will be abolished altogether.<p>I argue that I get his position, but that it's still immoral to discriminate against black people, and so in the short term he should vote to make the situation equitable . And then you come along, and say, ""your view on morality is your view, and that's all there is to it"" and ""attempting to push this on other people by mandating in law is the worst form of bigotry."" That's narrow-minded and pigheaded, no?<p>Ron Paul's the bad guy here, even if he has some idealistic long-term view of the perfect solution that one of the victims of his votes might even agree with. You say ""we can believe opposite things, and still accept each other as we are"": well, you can get legally married, get benefits from my tax money, and get special rights from the government, while I can't. That's shitty, and Ron Paul prefers to posture for his ideology over actually considering the day-to-day suffering of regular people resulting from that shittiness.",1325356674

By the same standard, almost all current video games would be illegal, as would most works in any creative medium that fell into an existing genre. But I suspect the court, at the time, didn't appreciate video games as a medium that could have genres. Atari initially lost the case but then won on appeal, apparently to everyone's great surprise.<p>EDIT: I read the appellate court decision and discovered some things.<p>First, this only got as far as a preliminary injunction, as far as I can tell. I haven't found anything about an actual trial happening. So, the legal decision was simply that Atari had a <i>decent chance</i> of winning at trial, and the potential harm to them justified an injunction, not that there was definitely any infringement.<p>The potential for infringement was based not on similar game mechanics, but rather on the more superficial similarities between the characters and aesthetics. In other words, it would be ok to make a maze-eating-chasing game that played just like Pac-Man, but featured squirrels eating nuts and being chased by dogs. It was decided that K.C. Munchkin needlessly copied some small details from Pac-man, like the ghosts and the ""gobbler"". This was compared to a playwrite copying specific characters and settings rather than re-telling a story in an original way. (That playwrites are not limited to 8x8 pixels and two colors when creating their characters is not touched upon in the decision.)",1325355871

3411439,comment,3411148,3411371,0,0,moocow01,,,"Good points... I think its a social problem that we in the US  have been failing at especially during the last few decades.  Right now we have this dynamic in society where the all the spoils go to the 'winners' even though everyone is contributing in some form (usually by means of competition).  This ends up encouraging somewhat of a macro-trend where everyone works very very hard to beat off others to get a piece of the pie but most inevitably end up failing to get wealthy and live 'luxuriously'.  As a result of this feast or famine attitude, people end up getting over devoted to work and labor while ignoring many other very important aspects of life (in the sense of actually living)... culture, child-rearing, fun, relaxation, etc. (- note that these are the descriptors of 'luxury')<p>I think as a society we shouldn't be looking at automation as ""Oh my god that machine is going to eat those people's jobs"" - we should be looking at it as ""Wow, we collectively don't have to do that crap anymore""  Similarly to how somebody looks at a Roomba and says goodbye to pushing a vacuum around for an hour.  But what fucks this all up - the distribution of money.  Because the way distribution of money works in America, we look at it as those cashiers are now going to starve and die.<p>MBA thinking has morphed us into thinking life is about production and consumption (full stop).  Its not (full stop).  The majority of the population is relatively starved of the 'other things' in life and we should be reevaluating how automation can help us all focus on the things that make real life a better experience.  Unfortunately were too busy all miserably hoarding money from each other like a bunch of dumb apes.<p>So back to your question about excess creative production - we shouldn't care about who consumes it in an idealistic scenario.  If people genuinely enjoy the creative process, they should be doing it because they enjoy it and hopefully that can be more afforded by automation.",1325355473
3411438,comment,3409171,3409171,0,0,zvrba,,,"Why do we make things so complicated? Because C++ is a low-level abomination pretending to be a high-level language.  Let's start.<p>- Allocators in the STL are a joke, so you can't use them for implementing different memory models.  So you end up implementing, e.g., linked lists from scratch.<p>- You can't ""steal"" underlying storage from a vector, which means you can't use it as a simple memory pool.  So you end up implementing a vector from scratch.<p>- size() of containers returns an unsigned type, which is a perpetual source of code ugliness and cursing in may day-to-day programming.  (The most trivial example: make a backward loop through a vector.  No, don't tell me to use iterators -- index has also semantical meaning in my use-cases.)<p>- There is static_cast, reinterpret_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, but no cast which would actually check that what you're trying to do makes sense. (C and C++ standards stipulate that casting from A to B is well-defined A is a ""prefix"" of B.  This could be extended to check for layout compatibility, so it would be legal to cast a linearly triply-derived struct with 3 floats to a float array with 3 elements.  Technically, it's UB, but ""it works in practice"", and that ""it works"" could have been formalized. The compiler would be allowed to reject non-working cases.)<p>- Writing flexible, generic (template) code is all nice in theory, but, in practice, it goes against the idea of separate compilation, with corresponding increased compilation times.<p>- Debugging heavily templated code is a nightmare.<p>- Writing templated code is arduous.  Templates being turing-complete, we can never expect as good IDE support as for Java and C#. (I toyed with some simple Java programs in NetBeans and I almost cried when I had to back to my day-job of writing C++. IntelliSense of Visual Studio, like ""state of art"" IDE for C++, is CRAP compared to what you get from NetBeans/Eclipse for Java.)  I like more and more the idea of using a ""restricted"" language augmented with a powerful IDE.<p>- The idea of constructors establishing class invariants is all well and nice until you have to deserialize an object graph with cycles. (For this you must temporarily have an invalid object that is to be filled in later.)  Constructors/destructors make sense if you actually have to manage <i>resources</i>.<p>- etc, etc.<p>In short, C++ has a history of incorporating half-baked features into the language and/or standard library. Things get complicated because it IS complicated to get a half-baked feature to do what you actually need to accomplish.<p>What half-baked features?  I've already mentioned allocators and casting.<p>Then there's RTTI, whose implementation is complex, but I don't know whether any serious project uses it for something more than dynamic_cast. (In reality, you would like to have full reflection, but you have to implement it yourself.  Yes, it's complicated.)<p>When you try to implement reflection yourself, you will, almost invariably, use offsetof at some point, which, technically, yields UB in most cases, but also it WORKS in the most common cases (no MI, no virtual inheritance).<p>There is auto, there is declspec, but there is no complete type-deduction, so you often have to spell out things twice to the compiler, even though it already has all information it needs.<p>There is no structural polymorphism [this is related to lacking casts] -- you're supposed to write template code with corresponding bloat of object code and other, above-mentioned downsides of templates.<p>iostreams are barely useful: when opening a stream fails, there is no standard-defined way of finding out WHY it failed (non-existent file, permission denied, etc.. This is a KEY feature for any program that interacts with a human user.) In C, IO functions set the errno variable, but not C++ streams. If you're lucky, errno will be set by the underlying system call and won't be changed further, but you can't count on that.  Yet another fail (i.e., half-baked feature).<p>Another iostreams misfeature: overloaded operators << and >> : the program code leads you to believe that things execute sequentially, where, in fact, the code is converted to function calls with unspecified evaluation order of arguments.  So if f() has side-effects, you don't know what cout << f() << f() will output.<p>==<p>Maybe the new C++ standard fixes some of the above issues, but I'm so disappointed by the overviews of what's new, that I won't even bother checking.  Many things are just cosmetic, some are outright stupid (e.g., user-defined literals), but fundamental problems of piled-up, half-baked features remain.",1325355448

Those are becoming as useful as SSL warnings or UAC - just click ok, because in 99% of cases, it's bogus. That's pretty much all they do - almost all the time they're near checkouts, they're busy accepting errors.<p>There are also products which do change weight.

The default behaviour of Haystack is geared towards getting up and running with search quickly, I've had to tweak a lot of the Solr backend to make it not fall over with our index of 9m products.<p>Solr is incredibly easy to work with directly, so if you know you're going to be using it as a core part of your site functionality, you might want to consider skipping Haystack entirely (the 2.0 version is a big improvement but it's not released yet).<p>A few examples:<p>- The default behaviour of Haystack is to commit on every update. Say you're doing batches of 1000, if you've optimised your indexing database queries well, you might be able to issue an update every 10 seconds or so. The problem is that issuing a commit against an index of 9m every 10 seconds (more frequently if using multiple processes or threads) or so is going to eat up memory and disk space fast. So if you have this scenario, make sure you disable the default commit behaviour and issue manual commits instead (we're doing it every 200k documents).<p>- Faceting by Author was a key feature, and we had about 500k of them. Haystack's faceting functionality didn't provide any mechanism to limit the number of facet choices returned, or to limit them to just those with a count > 0. It was an easy fix, but you might miss it if you're not careful.<p>- We only had a few fields we were interested in searching over, but had about 50 that were candidates for faceting. The Solr schema generated by haystack assumes you're going to want to search over every field, which means there's a lot of unnecessary overhead. Make sure you look over every field and think about how you're going to use it and turn off as much as possible. From what I can recall, using omitNorms and omitTermFreqAndPositions appropriately ended up saving us 2GB of otherwise wasted RAM. Some wise guy on my project decided to try and be helpful and run the manage.py command for generating the schema before they committed :)<p>Haystack is an excellent piece of work, but in this project (E-Comm site with 9m products) it ended up costing more time than it saved.

Do you mean that computers can&#x27;t solve the Halting Problem, but humans can solve many instances of the question &quot;will this question halt&quot;? Then you&#x27;re not comparing apples with apples. You should instead compare human reasoning of &quot;this program will halt or not&quot; with programs developed in the field of termination analysis. Are these analysis bad compared to human ones?<p>Or do you mean that humans can prove the undecidability of the Halting Problem, but computers can&#x27;t manage to prove or disprove it, or understand the human proofs? Does this have to do with such proofs tend to be non-constructive, as far as I&#x27;ve seen?<p>In any case, I guess it&#x27;s still an open problem whether or not the human mind can algorithmically solve the Halting Problem, right?

You are telling me that disenfranchising people like me that hold non-mainstream political views is by design. That&#x27;s outright offensive to me.<p>You are also wrong: It is <i>not</i> by definition going to be the majority opinion of everyone in my &quot;community&quot;.<p>For starters, the person who won the seat I live in got 43% of the vote. The majority of my community wanted other people to represent them.<p>The current system the worst of both worlds: Single seat constituencies without even the pretence of trying to find a candidate a majority would stand behind.<p>Secondly, lets disabuse ourselves of the notion that the electoral boundaries matches a &quot;community&quot;. They do not.<p>My seat includes uppper class areas in Shirley, with million pound mansions, as well as council estates like New Addington - the latter is one of the places in the UK with the lowest average life expectancy. The electoral seat encompasses perhaps a dozen separate communities that rarely mixes other than superficially. We can see clearly how divided this seat is - as many others - by looking at council election results, where various wards go very, very firmly on way or the other, while the seat as a whole is a very marginal seat (this election the Tory incumbent held onto his seat with a 165 vote plurality).<p>In reality, if one were to draw up geographically based communities based on how people actually live and work and interact together, there&#x27;d be maybe a dozen separate areas.<p>Apart from the flaw of thinking that areas as large as a parliamentary seat - even in London where the population density means the physical areas are fairly small - will be homogenous enough or closely enough linked to represent a single community, when you look at the overall electoral results you see pretty clearly that &quot;community&quot; does no longer - if it ever did - match geographical boundaries. Communities are split between parties that stands so far apart that pretending that community is geographical is a joke.<p>But in the end whether or not you believe that the representative should represent a community, or that the point is to represent the <i>voices of the people</i>, the fact is that this system leaves millions upon millions of users without a voice where it matters, and without the ability to influence decisions in parliament if they vote their conscience.<p>You may think that&#x27;s acceptable.

9516352,comment,9515125,9515789,0,0,chris_wot,,,"This honestly seems like FUD. Currently the Sys-V like serialisation of services at startup hasn&#x27;t been efficient, and sysvinit doesn&#x27;t handle event based kernel features at all well. And it&#x27;s definitely not modular.<p>As for this argument that it&#x27;s monolithic in its code organisation - lolwut? You don&#x27;t need to have a seperate repository for each binary, hardly anyone does that. When you talk about clearly and vigorously defined interfaces, it seems to already have them - and I hardly consider sysvinit to be a great example of such a thing - a bunch of cobbled together shell scripts serialised into a particular order isn&#x27;t particularly clean or elegant. Heck, it&#x27;s not even necessarily easy to troubleshoot if things go wrong. The systemd source is in one git repo, sure, but I can&#x27;t see why maintenance will be a burden. What in particular concerns you?<p>You do realize that there are only a few binaries? Let&#x27;s look at them:<p><i>networkd</i>: handles network events - when a network device is created it handles setup. No, it does not supplant udev. Read here an overview: <a href=""https://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd/</a><p>Not a bad idea here: and very sensible aspect of systemd.<p><i>journald</i> - collects log data from a variety of sources and puts it into a binary indexed data file. The most controversial aspect of systemd, but of course as is overlooked all the log data can be forwarded to syslog, kmsg, the console or wall via a simple configuration change.<p>Or, you can swap out the component: <a href=""https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/20/change-systemds-binary-logging-to-text-logging-in-sabayon-linux/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/20/change-sys...</a><p><i>logind</i> handles logins<p><i>systemd-user-sessions.service</i> allows restricting user logins via PAM<p>Then there are the systemd units - it handles sockets for socket activation, which is a key reason Debian chose systemd over Upstart. It handles devices via udev, mount points (a key aspect to initialising systems), automount, swap, path-based activation and timers.<p>I can&#x27;t see how any of the above should NOT be part of an init system. Init systems should be capable of handling dynamic events. All the technical arguments I&#x27;ve seen so far, with the exception of binary log files, don&#x27;t hold any water. There are apparently security concerns over PID 1 - but they seem rather specious. Have a look at the dependency list here at <a href=""https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/docs/systemd-dependencies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/docs/systemd-dependenc...</a> if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of bashing of systemd, but most of it (if not all of it!) is unwarranted and can be verified with even a modicum of research.",1431179009

Also, after a while I had more and more dead code, which wasn&#x27;t easy to identify and I couldn&#x27;t be sure that if I remove some class, I don&#x27;t have any elements that depend on it. Non-deterministic resolution was also an issue for me - say user was on a page A (therefore had loaded A.css with class .main-button) where particular boxes are blue. If the user goes to page B (we load B.css which also has .main-button) he should have red boxes. But if the user gets back to page A, the boxes that are supposed to be blue are red (browser cached the style and when browser have 2 classes definitions, the one that was loaded the last &quot;wins&quot;). Sure, we could use IDs for everything, bundle all styles into 1 file etc., but bigger sites would have like 5MB CSS file and at the end of the day it&#x27;s still hard to maintain the codebase.<p>I&#x27;m sure that &quot;normal&quot; way works for regular/medium sites (it worked for a few good years, right?), but I see ton of advantages for using the inline styles in the JS. It&#x27;s not easy to &quot;convert&quot; to new approach, but I honestly don&#x27;t look back. As I&#x27;ve said - it&#x27;s not ideal solution, but a very important step forward.<p>This is a good 3-part tutorial on react, flux and some other things:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6Ub7Ju2RM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6Ub7Ju2RM</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR22EWW-CVc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR22EWW-CVc</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fhTawDEE9k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fhTawDEE9k</a>",1431178670

A lot of big companies run applications that are not nearly as resilient to failure or nearly as linearly scalable as the systems routinely built by the internet giants.<p>I realized this before with regards to the ridiculously overpriced top-top-of-the-line CPUs. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re running an existing application at, say, a moderately small scale: 20 servers. Each server is only handling a couple dozen requests per minute, so the load is not very high, but the requests still take too long. You&#x27;ve hired a whole team of engineers to work on optimizing the code to make it run faster, and that costs you, say $10 million a year. You&#x27;d be happy to buy another hundred servers if that made it run any faster, but that&#x27;s just not how it works -- the application is all single-threaded code, and maybe you can make that better, but that&#x27;s what your $10 million engineering team is working on (maybe). So in the meantime, you spend whatever amount of money you can on getting the absolute fastest hardware you can find to throw in those servers -- fast CPUs, fast hard drives, fast network... and even if those servers cost $50k each, that&#x27;s still just a fraction of what you&#x27;re spending on the software engineering work.",1431178069

Alternative vote is plainly more complex - first something happens, then perhaps something else happens, then... etc; it&#x27;s not complex for smart HN readers, but even trying to explain it in a few words shows it&#x27;s more involved than the other two systems.<p>I am fundamentally uncertain that a majority of the electorate understood AV when they were voting - and this was certainly supported by my own conversations at the time with moderately intelligent people who plainly did not understand it.  And, in fact, the majority of the electorate did not even vote at all on the issue.<p>Proportional representation is undeniably more democratic than either FPTP or AV, but it does mean you end up having to live with the fact that a rather alarmingly large proportion of people have views that the majority find unsavoury (eg. the BNP managed nearly 2% of the votes in the 2010 election).",1431178002

Much of the historical success of the US government can be attributed to the stability afforded by its two-party system.

But again, I don&#x27;t know Michael so I want to move away from that. Because a larger point can be made here: this would be an example of how MANY people have blinders to their own reasons they aren&#x27;t finding work-- and certainly not only people who blog about their personal problems.<p>I get this all the time. Every excuse in the book and then I ask: &quot;Did you follow up?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Did you send a physical letter or make a physical cold call, or even a telephone phone call-- something to break through the noise?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; And then I prod them to do those things and they don&#x27;t. An unfortunate part about the job search is that its a sales process and many people don&#x27;t require sales skills to do many jobs yet suddenly we expect them to sprout sales skills like wings when suddenly its time to look for work, often when they are at their most vulnerable moment-- the time they NEED that job. It&#x27;s a cruel farce. But there are ways around it.<p>That&#x27;s why I talk about exploding toilets-- a lot of companies just need the work done. Ask any sleazy late-night locksmith if he works on his sales skills. No, he has the tool you need when you are locked out of your apartment at 3am. You want him or not? Fortunately or unfortunately, there are enough exploding toilets out there that job seekers who really want to fix problems don&#x27;t have to worry too much about navigating the job search as a sale-- they just have to get some attention. But in order to get attention, they need to want to get it and that&#x27;s often a bigger problem than you know b/c most people don&#x27;t want to fail or risk looking ridiculous, as if these people they are contacting will even remember them-- and then they create excuses for why they can&#x27;t and often blame others.<p>But again, back to the original point: the reason we think is the problem often isn&#x27;t so trying to deconstruct it is pointless. It&#x27;s like dating. If someone isn&#x27;t a match, move on. Someone out there wants you desperately-- but only if you want to help them and can.",1431177101

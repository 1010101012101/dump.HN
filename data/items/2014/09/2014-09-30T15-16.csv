8388909,comment,8387984,8388662,3,0,wpietri,,,"I think that would only work if neither A nor B exposes anything about C. I&#x27;m not a Haskell user, but certainly in Scala and Ruby there are plenty of libraries where library consumers see objects from underlying libraries.<p>Suppose C is a JSON library, for example. In my code I fetch a JSON object from A, with library version C1. What happens when I pass that object to library B, which uses C2? Is that an immediate type violation because C1 and C2 are treated as different types? Do you live with runtime failures when, say, B calls a C2 method not in C1? Do you you try to create some sort of magic object conversion and hope that the data isn&#x27;t too different? Or do you try to require all libraries to describe how to convert data from every version to every other version?<p>Even if the two libraries never interacted and data could be proven never to flow between them, there&#x27;s a real question as to what version of the library is available from the main code.<p>Despite my concerns, I suspect that you could make this mostly work if you were cavalier about possible runtime errors, because actual conflicts would be rare. But from what I understand of the Haskell community, they&#x27;re not big on &quot;cross our fingers and hope it works at runtime&quot; approaches.",1412092556

8388887,comment,8388282,8388490,4,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>First, many (I dare say most) Go developers[0] don&#x27;t really use any &quot;solution&quot; for this other than the features built into the language itself. In other words, they&#x27;re not out there writing alternative solutions because they genuinely don&#x27;t perceive a lack of generics to be as big of a problem as other things, which they do write tools for.</i><p>I dare say that most people don&#x27;t use generics, because most people are not library authors and abstraction builders. As soon as you get into that territory, the lack of generics starts to seriously hurt. Because it&#x27;s one thing to build a component that&#x27;s very specific to a job at hand, it&#x27;s quite another to build something reusable and I&#x27;m not even thinking about reusability by other people.<p>One example would be data-structures. Sure you can build your own concurrent data-structure for moving bytes between threads, sprinkled with domain specific utilities that operates on it, because that&#x27;s what your application requires. It&#x27;s quite another job entirely to come up with a set of reusable data-structures that can be used no matter the contained values and that exposes high-level operators for manipulating them and then you end up building half-baked data-structures for each job at hand you have.<p>Another example is abstracting over common patterns by means of higher-order functions. Say you want to send messages between channels, threads, address spaces or what have you, in classic producer/consumer style, but without the producer carrying about whom subscribes to its notifications. Then you realize that your stream could be manipulated for fetching just the information that you want by means of `map`, `filter` or `flatMap`. Say you want to abstract away the loops one normally does with the atomic CompareAndSwap, so you think of operators like `transformAndGet(f: OldValue => NewValue)` / `getAndTransform` and `getAndExtract(f: OldValue => (Extracted, NewValue))`, which are not uncommon in other languages, so it&#x27;s not like we are being original here.<p>Basically, every piece of abstraction that could happen with higher-order functions is overkill for a static language without generics in it. And people don&#x27;t see it, because most people aren&#x27;t thinking of doing abstractions by means of higher-order functions. And Go&#x27;s interfaces are seriously not enough because we are talking about a different kind of polymorphism here.<p>And in regards to people coming up with their own solutions, I see it no different than with Perl and the lack of OOP-ish facilities baked in the language that drove people to building multiple, often shitty and incompatible alternatives. Yes, this eventually led to Moose, but the ecosystem is still plagued by older implementations, because open-source never really dies. And I would remind you that most people that were using Perl in the beginning had no use for OOP, it just so happens that people eventually did need the libraries that needed OOP, going back to my original point that it doesn&#x27;t matter if most people don&#x27;t feel a need for generics, the more important question being what do library authors think about it and I&#x27;m pretty sure that people publishing libraries aren&#x27;t happy.",1412092333

It was its own theory.  And in the current theories, the &#x27;big bang&#x27; at the start remains.  But much else has changed.<p>Since we&#x27;ve carried the thread so long, I&#x27;ll relate something marginally off topic that you might find kinda cool.  At the time (I was in grad school then), it was a <i>big deal</i> to make the from Big Bang to Inflation, for <i>political</i> reasons.  The &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory, in order to explain the smoothness of the observed universe, required a very special Creation event.  Natural law wouldn&#x27;t do it.  This was a comfortable place because 80-90% of Americans believe in a Creator, and science was saying it was necessary.  So Church leaders and science got along (except for the batshit folks).<p>When Inflation gained acceptance, this need for a Creator to explain the smoothness went away, and there was genuine concern in the field about the ability to continue to get funding from these Americans.<p>So, really, I suspect that the &#x27;really dark dense thing&#x27; will remain, and be called a &#x27;black hole,&#x27; even if our understanding of &#x27;Black Holes&#x27; significantly changes.",1412092309

8388789,comment,8388409,8388694,9,0,bradleyland,,,"Let&#x27;s keep some perspective here. Apple holds a minority share of the market. One might argue that the money is on the Apple platform. That leads to the question of why? Maybe it&#x27;s because Apple&#x27;s carefully curated experience attracts customers who have a large intersection with the group of customers who are willing to spend money.<p>If we accept that premise, then what&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; is what builds that user base. You have to take the bad with the good. I sound like a broken record at this point, but there is plenty of history surrounding apps that act as launchers. That singular feature represents a huge overlap with the primary role of the home screen, and the App Store Guidelines clearly spell out that this is a no-no.<p>Widgets are a new case, because they&#x27;re not full fledged apps. A widget could not &quot;create an alternate desktop/home screen environment&quot; because it is only a small part of a greater environment itself (Notification Center). However, the intent of guideline 10.4 is pretty clear. Apple wants to control the means by which users launch applications. That goal serves what Apple believes to be the best interest of users. You can disagree with that, but it&#x27;s not your platform, and you haven&#x27;t (yet) built a platform upon which millions of dollars are transacted in app purchases every year.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that Apple isn&#x27;t exactly clubbing seals here. They&#x27;re doing what they believe to be best for their platform, and they&#x27;re doing it in a way that is pretty consistent with past behavior.",1412091535

Who knows, but a quick non-nuclear win was certainly not in the cards.<p>>would the superpowers have been as restrained as they were in reality?<p>Arguably, if the US used nukes on Chinese soldiers during the Korean conflict, as some generals advised, there would be no North Korea.  We&#x27;d have a cowed China and built a single free and democratic Korea, essentially one large South Korea.

From a game theory perspective they had no incentive to fight a full scale war because it would annihilate both sides quickly.  Its a losing outcome for all. Instead, it led to dozens of brutal proxy conflicts in non-nuclear states paid for by the lives of young men of those states. How many died because of the advance of Communism in Asia? How many states failed because of it? How many did Stalin send to their deaths?<p>These are not trivial numbers.

8388746,comment,8385306,8385817,1,0,kazinator,,,"What I mean by shared memory is that the null-terminated strnig is self-describing. If two processes attach a region of shared memory (at a different virtual address in each process), one process can put a null-terminated string into that memory, and the other process sees a string object. No length or pointer value have to be communicated, just the bytes of the self-describing string object itself.<p>This is not the case with your proposed string representation.<p>I never claimed that there is a best string representation, or that the same representation should be used externally and internally. (I can prove that I don&#x27;t believe that by pointing to programs I have written which don&#x27;t do that; for instance my TXR language, written in C, has garbage collected strings that are arrays of wide characters internally, all I/O is done using UTF-8, and most string operations are applicative rather than destructive. Yet, those underlying character arrays are null terminated, for pragmatic reasons of environmental interoperability.)<p>The &quot;fat reference&quot; representation of strings is interesting, but has the disadvantage of splitting the string into two (or more) objects: the data, which is in one location, and meta-data which is in another location. This is fine for internal representations, but creates obstacles if we do want to use this as an external representation. Yet, by itself, it is not a sufficiently robust internal representation that it warrant outrageous claims of superior safety: after all, the underlying storage is a simple C-like array which doesn&#x27;t know how long it is. It is not null terminated strings which cause buffer overflows, but the underlying unchecked array data type.<p>What&#x27;s good about the representation is that you can play even more representational tricks, like have N references to the same storage, all representing different strings. (This is prone to errors if the storage is mutated; I don&#x27;t know how you can possibly accuse null terminated strings for only being useful and safe when they are compile-time immutable, while in the same posting you propose a hack that is more similar than it is different.)<p>&quot;Fat reference strings&quot; are subject to buffer overruns (length field being wrong), aliasing problems (deleting a character from a string but not decrementing the length in all of the references that exist), dangling pointer problems (references to storage that has been deleted) and so on. (Note by the way that null terminated strings at least have the property that if we have multiple pointers aimed at the same string, and we edit that string in place, all the pointers see the new string, and not some half-baked string. We can even insert characters, if the underlying buffer has enough slack.)<p>It is not reasonable to believe that programmers who make mistakes when programming with null-terminated strings will suddenly write correct code when using fat-referenced strings.<p>If you use a language like C++ instead of C, and represent these fat references as smart pointer classes, then you can achieve a lot of safety. Basically C++&#x27;s std::basic_string template can already be implemented this way. But then you&#x27;re tied to a particular memory management scheme and programming language. Also, safely and correctly implementing those tricks whereby one string&#x27;s storage is displaced into another one, requires a lot more baggage in the smart pointer. std::basic_string implementations typically use reference counting to manage the lifetime of the underlying array, and so the underlying array needs a refcount. And so it goes.<p>In any case, null-terminated strings serve requirements which are poorly suited by such managed strings.",1412091192

8388712,comment,8388156,8388308,6,0,cwal37,,,"No, he&#x27;s not doing more to tackle climate change than anyone on this planet. Let&#x27;s say 25,000 sales in 2013 and 35,000 sales in 2014 [1]. That&#x27;s 60,000 cars. Now let&#x27;s take the numbers for electric GHG emissions vs. conventional emissions from this 2006 paper[2]. This is more of a reference, I&#x27;m not trying to say this paper is the unassailable truth. Also a disclaimer, these numbers will obviously be rough, again, just trying to paint a picture.<p>These numbers have 3 scenarios, all fairly optimistic:<p>Conventional (gasoline) emissions are 19.9 kg GHG emissions per 100 km.<p>1. Electricity is produced from renewables and nuclear<p>1a. Electric emissions are 0.343 kg/100km<p>2. 50% electricity from renewables, and 50% from natural gas with a 40% efficiency<p>2a. Electric emissions are 5.21 kg/100km<p>3. All electricity from natural gas with a 40% efficiency<p>3a. Electric emissions are 10.1kg/100km<p>At this point, I should note that burning natural gas has roughly half the emissions associated with burning coal in terms of CO2 equivalency.<p>Let&#x27;s run with the middle scenario, which is still totally not representative of the country as a whole[3]. And we need some mileage, thankfully there are statistics on that. I&#x27;ll use the 35-54 age group, which I&#x27;m guessing are the most likely to own Teslas, so 15,291 miles a year[4], which becomes 24,608km.<p>Aright, so we have 60,000 electric cars that we&#x27;re gonna assume are straight-up replacing 60,000 conventional cars. Each car would replace 14.69<i>(24608/100) = 3614.9152kg/year</i>(60,000 cars) = 216,894,912kg. This is the annual grossly simplified reduction in emissions of replacing 60k conventional cars (using numbers from that paper for what a conventional car means) based on that idealized generation mix.<p>In 2012, our emissions were 6,526 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent[5]. Scaled down to our kilograms, it becomes 6,526,000,000,000kg. That amount displaced up above would account for 0.00332% of total emissions in 2012 based on those numbers.<p>For some other perspective, Ford F-series sales have been up significantly the past two years[6] post-ish recession, and 16 mpg seems like a reasonable average for that line of vehicles[7].<p>More perspective, the MIT study &quot;The Future of Coal&quot;[8] pegged an average 500MW coal plant as producing 3 million tons of CO2 a year (although it ranged up to 4.5 or so million tons in other literature). That presents a range of 2,722,000,000 - 4,082,000,000 kg. Although not all of that is necessarily emitted in every case. So, displacing one 500MW coal plant with say, a large wind farm, would displace 12.5x what those 60k cars would do annually.<p>Basically, what I&#x27;m getting at is that researchers and policy makers involved with utilities, DOE initiatives, and state governments (via RPS, no overarching federal clean energy policy[although the PTC obviously has a huge effect]) are probably all doing more to tackle climate change than Elon Musk. Not to crap on him, I would love to own a Tesla, I just like energy topics.<p>Links 2 and 8 are pdfs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors#Model_S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors#Model_S</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~sabrash/110/Chem%20110%20Spring%202014%20Articles/Economic_and_environmental_comparison%20of%20conventional.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~sabrash/110/Chem%20110%20...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&fuel=vvg&geo=g&sec=g&linechart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.AOR-US-99.M&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.M&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M&freq=M&start=200101&end=201407&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://www.fuelly.com/car/ford/f-150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fuelly.com/car/ford/f-150</a>\n[8] <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/coal/The_Future_of_Coal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/coal/The_Future_of_Coal.pdf</a>",1412090885

Remember when iOS apps first hit and there were a whole slew of &quot;home screen&quot; apps that displayed things like the weather, calendars, etc? Apple banned all those apps too. The reason given was that Apple doesn&#x27;t want apps to usurp the home screen. Apple wants to control that part of the user experience, because Apple knows best.<p>> Instead, Apple is being Apple and aggressively protecting things that do not need to be protected.  They do so with inscrutable and nebulous reasons that leave all involved feeling dismayed.<p>This is purely a matter of opinion. Apple feels that they need to control the user experience. Just read the introduction to the App Store Review Guidelines [1]. Apple&#x27;s stance is really clear: they control what happens on their platform. They&#x27;ve made some efforts to make the process a bit less lopsided (the appeal board), but it&#x27;s still crystal clear that Apple holds the reigns.<p>If, as a developer, you disagree with that philosophy, you have to decide how to best effect change. I would argue that continuing to develop for the Apple platform is about the <i>worst</i> way one can affect change. Proselytizing the developer community is a fool&#x27;s errand. Look at the case of the larger iPhone. What drove that? Apple looked at the market landscape and decided that they could no longer ignore the trend.<p>IMO, your best choice as a developer is cast your lot with the platform that best reflects your philosophy.<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/</a>",1412090690

A lot of mobile device reviews are pretty unsophisticated, so there&#x27;s a lot of spilled ink about button location, how the metal/plastic feels, etc.  Its a strange regression. Like we just can&#x27;t judge or weigh the complexity of a modern mobile OS and all its services and apps and just take on this simplified, &quot;Uh, it looks nice&quot; point of view.<p>Strange that even a hard-nosed tech site like anandtech can&#x27;t resist the typical fetishiztion of buttons and whispered sighs of &quot;So intuitive&quot; and &quot;designey!&quot; Meanwhile, valid competitors like the Nexus or Samsung line-ups either get strict apathy or get criticized in a way that Apple is immune to (for example the Note&#x27;s size being unacceptable yet the 6+ size being perfect).  Or the Jobsian logic that the press repeats (size of iphone is perfect because of human thumb size) and then ignores when even Apple itself doesn&#x27;t buy that argument anymore.<p>I think the world of tech reviewing proves how well marketing works, especially against those who often see themselves as resistant to it and self-declared rational/skeptical/intellectual thinkers. If anything, these types seem more susceptible to it for some reason.<p>I don&#x27;t even really read reviews in a serious fashion at this point, except maybe at Ars.  Reviews seem to be marketing vehicles, either consciously or sub-consciously on the part of the reviewer. Ars seems to be more even-handed than most and they try not to fall too deeply into the trap of bikeshedding or pandering for ad impressions.  I can&#x27;t be the only one unhappy with how these things are reviewed nowadays.  It seems like the narrative of the &quot;nerds have won&quot; in regardless to tech is pretty disingenious. If anyone has won, its the marketers. The more you spend to promote your talking points, the more often those talking points will be believed or, at least, repeated.  It doesn&#x27;t seem anymore complex than that.<p>I&#x27;m also willing to concede that there&#x27;s a subjective element here that makes reviewing of commodity tech almost like reviewing the arts.  At a certain point performance, durability, etc are all fine for the top competitors and reviews just address things that are more subjective than objective for the lack of things to talk about.  Mobile has certainly reached that space and the only rational move for these companies is to just invest more in marketing to make your &#x27;SoC tied to a touchscreen tied to a mobile OS tied to an app store&#x27; look better than the other guy&#x27;s &#x27;SoC tied to a touchscreen tied to a mobile OS tied to an app store.&#x27;<p>Now the role of the reviewer is to communicate these marketing messages effectively.",1412089879

For instance, one aspect of &quot;generics&quot; is to write &quot;general algorithms&quot; that don&#x27;t care about the underlying data structure. Interfaces basically solve that problem. You write the &quot;general algorithm&quot; to a specified interface, and provide things that match that interface. It&#x27;s pretty much &quot;concepts&quot; in C++. This is what the Go community correctly refers to when it says that we don&#x27;t always need &quot;generics&quot; and that interfaces can be used instead... there is a specific and important <i>use case</i> for &quot;generics&quot; that is indeed covered by the interfaces.<p>The community is correct when it points out the problems are not as large as some external people are supposing, and the external critics are also correct when they observe that not all useful use cases are covered by interfaces in Go.<p>And I&#x27;d say the biggest uncovered useful use case is type-safe containers that aren&#x27;t slices, arrays, or maps. What&#x27;s more, Go&#x27;s core target, network servers, is also precisely where the runtime characteristics of many of these more exotic data structures are important in the first place. Entire scripting languages are perfectly happy with arrays and hash tables as the only two effective data structures (or even just hash tables with arrays emulated on top of them!), but they pay a level of speed a Go programmer is not necessarily willing or able to pay, because network servers very often become performance sensitive. So my opinion is that whether or not that solution is &quot;generics&quot;, Go badly needs <i>some</i> solution to the type-safe container problem.<p>(And I consider the &quot;you can do it with interface{}&quot; argument to be a dodge. It&#x27;s a very convenient moment to suddenly decide you don&#x27;t need static typing in an otherwise statically-typed language. Why stop there with that argument?)<p>Cover that one use case, and what&#x27;s remaining isn&#x27;t worth worrying about... it&#x27;s not like the world is full of languages with perfect, quirk-free generics implementations either, once you start studying them they all have issues of their own. There is a reason the Go designers are resisting them, after all.<p>And I can&#x27;t resist generalizing a bit... what&#x27;s important is not the <i>how</i> of a solution, but the <i>what</i>. If you have a problem than in some other language you&#x27;d hit with generics, then try to pick up Go, then scream because Go doesn&#x27;t have generics, that&#x27;s not interesting if in fact interfaces would work. The problem with &quot;Go lacking generics&quot; isn&#x27;t, well, Go lacking generics... the correct question is, <i>what set of problems are there than Go lacks good solutions to</i>? And, as I show above, I&#x27;m not saying that because there are no answers to that question... I named one, after all, and there&#x27;s a couple of more I could at least argue sensibly about. The point is that the conversation ought to be focused on solutions to the specific problems rather than insisting that &quot;the stick I know from another language&quot; has to be ported in. And, it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be focused on things that Go does indeed have perfectly cromulent solutions to, because interfaces <i>really do</i> cover a lot of the use cases of generics, in much the same way that in C++ templated generics can be used to implement &quot;concepts&quot;.

I used to buy filet mignon there for $7 a pound back in 2009 when I was living in Chelsea, as a recent migrant from California. I was very sad when it closed, and never knew the story.<p>It highlights a more general point: we, as humans, have a profound <i>attribution bias.</i> It&#x27;s psychological. We tend to attribute success to our own individual characteristics, actions, and free will. Americans significantly more so.[<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2786780?uid=2&uid=4&sid=21104247453601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2786780?uid=2&uid=4&si...</a>]<p>This would be fine, if it were true; however this attribution bias causes a significant departure from reality. When people succeed, we tend to focus on their personal attributes and actions, instead of looking at the situation surrounding them. When we do that, we tend to think of them as &quot;rising above their situation,&quot; or &quot;using their advantages well.&quot; We like to think we can do the same, but it is truly a kind of collective delusion.<p>We have to recognize that this is simply fantasy. It&#x27;s not backed up by truth. Statistics says much the opposite: that most people who try will fail, and that people will be significantly burdened by failure, and that people who have failed <i>or succeeded</i> are extremely affected by external effects; that most successes are the result of both individual <i>and</i> significant historical and contextual factors. Externalities are more important than we want to believe. They&#x27;re not everything, but they deserve much, <i>much</i> more attention than they get, which is often nil.<p>We would be a different kind of society were we to match our perception of success and failure with the reality of that success or failure. We don&#x27;t have to give up our sense of individualism and the respect for personal growth and contribution; we just need to back it up with a recognition of the surrounding factors that are extremely real and highly influential on all our lives.

65790,comment,65769,65776,0,0,catalinist,,,"Not really. There are articles worth submitting but because of user psychology and behavior it will not be posted. My logic is that the user will think: ""Well, if you didn't want it when I was ready to give it to you, why bother to return and re-submit it"". The software should come in the aid of the user, not the other way around. Of course, you might also take into consideration statistical behavior and think: ""If a user will not submit it, then other user will come and do it"" but that's really relaying on chance, and not a good plan to bet on it.",1192024389
65789,comment,65769,65769,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I tried to ""hack"" reddit a few days ago and got the message, even though I had only submitted one article!<p>
By hack, I mean that I wanted my article to appear on both ""business"" and the root. Well for some reason once you choose ""business"" you can't get that checkbox that says ""submit also to reddit"" to be active. Although it seems to work with ""programming"". So I chose programming, checked the box, then re-selected the business topic. The little checkbox stayed checked, although it was dimmed. When I hit the submit button, it gives me that ""submitting too fast"" message.<p>
Took about an hour to figure out that the ""too fast"" message must be some kind of fall-through case. Once I did not ""hack"" the UI, the submission went through okay. I still don't know if the UI was broken or working correctly, but the error message sure could use some improvement. (as well as the UI, imo)",1192024337

65786,comment,65769,65769,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I wonder how much companies could benefit from a human oracle. The way HackerNews gives weight to votes is interesting and relevant.<p>First, a human marks certain users as very legit. There need only be one marker. Next, the users those marked users mod-up in the normal course of the site are added to a white-list of users that can submit at any rate. <p>This wouldn't be hard, would be completely opaque to the users, and would avoid annoying messages thrown at your most active real users.<p>There are many, many problems with reddit.",1192024188

65781,comment,65563,65745,0,0,NSX2,,,"With all due respect, WTF?!?  You maintain that people are the foundation.  Seems like in this case the people were not up to it.  Either the ""idea guys"" had an idea which was not compelling enough to motivate the programmers to overcome their personal conflicts, or the ""programmer guys"" were acting like a bunch of immature, childish, egotistical amateurs and let their personal opinions and the emotional sparks inherent in any high-pressure environment cloud their professional judgement.<p>Honestly even if your name was David Heinemeier Hansson and you were in my startup and I found you sitting on your rear end and doing nothing because you had a personal conflict with somebody in the company ... well maybe if you were David I'd toss the other guy out.  But anything short of that I'd have to have a serious pow-wow with both sides and lay the smack-down; too much money at stake these days and too much much-needed world changing to let shyness and immaturity get in the way.<p>So it seems like the idea was not THAT great, or the programmers not too mature, or the leadership completely lacking the ability to establish a vision strong enough and roadmap clear enough to get people to redirect their focus from the obstacles to the opportunity at hand.<p>So idea guys, programmers, lack of leadership - clearly all ""people problems"" .... how then do you make the leap in logic that the general idea itself was ""stupid even to try.""<p>That's like saying, ""Should architects get together with masons to figure out how to build houses more efficiently?  Well, we tried that once and the foreman and the architect got into an arguement, so it was stupid even to try.""<p>No, it wasn't stupid to try.  The outcome was stupid and that was because the trial components were stupid.  Doesn't mean the experiment design was stupid.<p>On the other hand, what is the implication of your argument, that only programmers can have ideas worth executing and that the rest of the world just sits on its collective rear end and wait until some programmer somewhere thinks up solutions to all the world's ills?<p>I think not.",1192023410

65776,comment,65769,65769,0,0,iamwil,,,"I'm going to guess it's also an anti-spam mechanism.  One of the easier ways to detect spam bots is the rate at which they submit.  My only other guess is that it could also be a social mechanism, where it forces users to submit higher quality articles.  If a user lost interest and won't come back and submit, then it probably wasn't worth submitting.",1192022916

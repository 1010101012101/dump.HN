51904,comment,51539,51539,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"As an audiophile, who might have actually been happy in an alternate universe where HDCD and DVD-Audio were successful and low-bitrate MP3 was a market failure... I've always thought that both HD video formats were screwed from day one, format war or no format war. They are niche products, at best. People (except for a few hundred thousand obsessives like myself) don't pay for audio quality, and I doubt they'll pay for video quality either. Especially when the ""low quality"" alternative is DVD, which doesn't really look that shabby if you focus on <i>watching the movie</i> instead of conducting A-to-B comparisons of black levels.<p>Give me a $35 DVD player and Bose's marketing team, and I'll outsell any HD player on the market. We'll mark the price up to $250, put it in a nice sleek brushed-aluminum case, hold special Demo Events in all the Best Buy stores, and you'll <i>swear</i> that my player has the crispest video in the world - because, as the quality differences become smaller, the psychological factors become more and more significant.<p>The only problem with this business plan is that Steve Jobs had it figured out <i>years</i> ago, and he's way ahead. While the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray folks fight it out, Steve is going to crush them by selling lower-quality video in higher-quality boxes.",1189198593

And now the same is true for Apple.  You can't beat them with lawsuits, only by making better products.<p>I'm not so sure, though, that the lawsuits MSFT faced had no effect on the marketplace outcomes we're now seeing.  Would PC vendors be so quick to put Linux on PCs if MSFT wasn't being monitored by the US DOJ and probed non-stop by the EU?",1189198172

He took pro-active steps to improve how he did, rather than just winning the genetic lottery.<p>When I took the SATs in 7th grade, I blitzed through the math section, having enough time for a full double-check and a spot triple-check.  Elsewhere in this thread, Vlad mentions that he did very poorly until he learned how to pace himself and answer all the questions.  Am I at an advantage because I have a knack for this stuff, or is Vlad because he actually learned techniques that work consistently?",1189196800

51886,comment,51578,51872,0,0,DocSavage,,,"When I think of the things that made Stanford special, I think of the exposure to world-class researchers.  Some classes were simply not available at other institutions. For example, I took ""Medical Artificial Intelligence"" from the guy who was the pioneer in expert systems for medicine.  I remember a two-quarter sophomore seminar with class size limited to six undergrads. We were taught plate tectonics by the Dean of Earth Sciences and worked with a grad student to develop a simulation in C.  Then there were all the opportunities to join research labs because there is so much world-class research going on at Stanford.  (This was back in the 80s.)  I am convinced that (1) you get out of college what you put into it, and (2) the main advantages of big research universities, aside from the diploma, is tapping into what makes them unique.<p>When I think of ""success in school,"" I don't immediately think of GPA.  It's not all about the courses, and in the debate of name-brand schools, I think it's rarely about the standard classes.\n",1189196266

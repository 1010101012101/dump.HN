Ghettos, police profiling, stop and frisk, exonerated death sentences based on DNA testing, dog-whistle politics, voter ID laws, and U.S. media can statistically be argued to show that the U.S. is racist against racial minorities. To speak scientifically you need to address group behavior and what perpetuates that group behavior.

8090581,comment,8090337,8090337,1,0,bediger4000,,,"This was roughly the situation circa 1990. There was a TCP/IP based NSFNet, VMS-based HEPNet/Spacenet and whatever DEC ran internally, a UUCP-based Usenet, Telenet, FIDO and probably some others I&#x27;m not remembering, not to mention various proprietary &quot;walled gardens&quot; like Compu$erve, Delphi, GEnie...<p>It was actually kind of interesting, for someone who wasn&#x27;t stuck in a &quot;my subculture is BEST!&quot; viewpoint. Innovations arose in a small population, and spread based on merit. Really niche populations (OS-9 on a Color Computer III, anyone?) could live in peace, and not be swamped by advertising and a mass market that demanded <i>everyone</i> be part of that mass market.  You could laugh at the hicks stuck in DELPHI, or worse yet, GEnie.<p>The reasons the author of this article gives for favoring a single market (because that&#x27;s what he really means) is &quot;it&#x27;s good for business, especially Big Business&quot;. Should I, as a consumer, just nod my head and say &quot;Yes, Yes!&quot;? A lot of generally accepted &quot;good things&quot; don&#x27;t work from my point of view. Internationalization?

8090580,story,,,45,64,fizwhiz,"Ask HN: Why does the enterprise have such a strong affinity to Java?",,"I&#x27;m trying to get a deeper understanding of how Java actually exploded into the mainstream &quot;enterprise&quot; and has continued to do so at least since the early 2000s. As a regular browser of HN, I&#x27;ve stumbled upon different flavors of commentary related to this in an ad-hoc fashion; some snarky like &quot;Oh you know, it&#x27;s a dumb-proof language that really doesn&#x27;t require people to have had a solid foundation in CS so hiring and ramp-up are easier&quot; and some more insightful like &quot;It&#x27;s not really Java the language, but Java the ecosystem (like JEE) and particularly the JVM that makes it an attractive proposition for enterprise companies&quot;. I&#x27;m wondering how much of this proliferation can be attributed to:<p>1. Features. Core functionality that the language/ecosystem provides like the JVM, portability, relative ease in multi-threaded programming, garbage collection etc)\n2. Timing. Was there a specific problem during the late 90s or early 2000s that was a sweet spot for solving using Java? Seeing that this was around the time when the internet really became mainstream, was Java primed to benefit from this in a way that set it apart from the then-contemporary programming ecosytems?\n3. Scalability. In terms of the number of people you can hire while &quot;growing&quot; your company; could the popularity of SOA/WebServices fueled this as well?<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not generalizing that every &quot;big&quot; company uses Java and I&#x27;m not saying that the ones that do are obviously doing it for the right reasons; I&#x27;m purely looking at this from academic interest since there&#x27;s so much rich nuanced history that I feel I don&#x27;t understand. Such a discussion could be easily extended to ask &quot;What does this mean for functional programming languages based on the JVM like Clojure and Scala&quot;. Like Mark Twain said: &quot;History may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes.&quot;",1406404645

8090484,comment,8075273,8075273,1,0,on_and_off,,,"Android and iOS have won the first world, it&#x27;s done.  \nSome contenders (Microsoft, Blackberry) try to grapple some market share, but unless Google or Apple do something very stupid it seems doomed to be a very hard & slow progression.  \nEven with Microsoft throwing moneys at every major app makers, the windows marketshare make it very hard for windows phone development to be worth it.<p>If I had to make a gamble, I would say that Google is going to take over the remaining 5 billion people too. Apple and emerging markets don&#x27;t go together at all. Microsoft & Firefox are targeting these markets but I feel that with Android One & the changes made in 4.4 in order to have acceptable performances on low end devices, Google has the formula to win. Nothing is done yet though.<p>Google has also decided to conquer other form factors. In order to do not frighten its partners, these products are called Android (and it is indeed the Android tech stack behind them). Google Wear is the first wearable device that makes sense to me. That does not mean that it will be a big hit, but it is a good start.<p>All these new hardware initiative (car, health, wearable, home, ...) from Apple & Google are very impressive. They have many ideas in common and both only work with mobile devices made by their company. There are probably at least some technical reasons behind that move but it is still very disappointing. I don&#x27;t think that anybody in their right mind could be entirely satisfied with a car or home automation system that dictate which brand of smartphone you are going to be able to use.<p>As an Android dev, I am confident in Google&#x27;s capacity to provide the tools I need. Even though I don&#x27;t think that Google made ALL the right choices (lockscreen widgets still look like a very weird choice to me, they seem to be disappearing with L though), my most critical needs were fulfilled with the last i/o round of announcements with improved performances, first class design (&#x27;Holo&#x27; was really starting to look bleak compared to the other OSes) and the replacement of the terrible ListView by RecyclerView.<p>There are a couple of parts where Android is still weak from a dev point of view :  \n-Even though Google is visually making many efforts in that area, the company does not have the tool making expertise that Apple or Microsoft have. Using IntelliJ was a very good move, the JetBrains guys know how to create an IDE. Right now we are in a weird phase where Google is slowly giving the finger to Eclipse and forcing us to migrate to Android Studio but it is still a bit immature. Staying with Eclipse means not benefiting from many new things, while migrating to AS means dealing with its bugs..<p>-Java is not as bad as its reputation can make you believe it is but there are real pain points (in the context of Android development at least, I don&#x27;t really know the other sides of Java development to be honest). For example, Enums in java are syntactically awesome but for big codebases, they can contribute to bloating up your app if you use too much of them (each time you use an enum for the first time, all its members need to be instantiated and enum also generates some big methods). The alternative is to use bitfield flags or simple ints. It is better from a performance perspective, but it is absolutely ugly to use and does not offer any type safety. Some of Java weaknesses can be overcome with things like EventBus or RXJava but some are too deeply engrained in the language in order to be solved.<p>-Again, Google does not have enough tool-making expertise. I should be able to override the default widgets colors with a simple line in my layouts. This has just been added with the L release and I am not even sure that it is a back-compatible change, this should have been an API lvl 1 feature. There are many other examples where hundred of lines of code are necessary whereas it should be doable in one line with a good framework.<p>-Fragmentation is also not that bad but it is a reality you will have to work with. Crashlytics, bugsense and other crash reporting solutions are your best friends in order to detect and fix major fragmentation issues. Anecdotally, so far Samsung has been the biggest source of such issues for me.<p>-According to Android engineers, Java is here to stay. Since they don&#x27;t communicate on their future plans, it is impossible to know whether they are working on alternatives or not but it would be welcome.",1406402234

Why?  Why not let the first valuation be lower?<p>Under a more reasonable interpretation, i.e. totally bootstrapped, and eventually reaches $1 billion, the stated company meets the criteria.

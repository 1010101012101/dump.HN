Employment-based Green Cards are filed typically under EB1/2 or 3. Make sure you don't let your employer and the lawyer make all your choices. Do some research.<p>An EB1 filing is the fastest - but you typically need a PhD or equivalent to qualify. Most other filings are in EB2/EB3 which approximate a MS/BS educational equivalent. EB1s could go as 'fast' as 1-2 years wheras EB2/EB3 could take 3-5 years.<p>These are typical numbers - counting from the day you file. \nI know folks that got it in just over a year in EB2 and folks that are still waiting 6 years after filing. All the best!",1206158242

Another phenomenon I've seen when working in larger groups/organizations is the predatory ways developers will pursue the core/api/library work so as to expand their freedom and limit their dependence on others. The essay's comments about the programmer at Google reminded me of this as I've seen it time and time again in my career. Whereas in the smaller groups/companies I've worked, all the developers were responsible for the entire stack. It felt more communal and I think the groups were healthier and more productive.",1206155100

None, but if the processors aren't doing any other work and your threads are the only available runnable threads then they're likely to get run.  As cores become more numerous, the problem will be keeping them occupied.  That's why Intel and AMD want you to start writing multi-threaded code.  NOW!

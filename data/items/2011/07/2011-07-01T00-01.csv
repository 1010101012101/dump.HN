They are tone-deaf as to why Facebook is successful.<p>Sure, circles will get plenty of usage in the Bay Area, where the people who built it probably felt if only they could build this one extra feature then people would come flocking to them away from Facebook. But this misses the point.<p>Nobody on Facebook, other than techno-geeks, have been clamoring for this. Are you the type of person who would consider deleting your Facebook account? You're probably also the type of person that will be interested in Circles. But, you also are the type of person that, unlike 99.99% of the rest of the population, can comprehend having a social life without Facebook being the glue.<p>Facebook is cool. Facebook gets people laid and lets you participate in more debauchery online once you have stumbled home drunk from the bar. It doesn't feel like a hospital room or a bathroom, it feels like a party.<p>If Google wants a chance to usurp Facebook's dominance, it needs to do so under a different brand. Repeat after me: the Google brand will never be as cool as Facebook.<p>More importantly though, it needs to figure out what Facebook is missing. No, Circles are not what Facebook is missing. There's certainly <i>something</i> that Facebook is missing, that the cool kids would want, but odds are whatever it is wouldn't pass the smell test of the type of things Google would consider building.<p>Imagine you are at a party. It's fun, the music is good, there is booze, and the people are good looking. What's missing? Google's response would be: ""The music is hard to hear, we should upgrade the speakers."" Facebook's response would be: ""cocaine.""<p>The reason Facebook has come up to where they are, after all, stems from the big brass balls they've had for pushing up against the standards of privacy and even decency held by society today, something Google has never and will never be able to (or should want to) do in return. This is why Google will keep fumbling around trying to ""out-innovate"" Facebook, and will fail again and again in spectacular ways. It's sad, but endearing.",1309480670

The higher precision devices are actually receiving data in LightSquared's licensed band (by having more receive bandwidth, they get better accuracy), on purpose. This is not the GPS devices' band to use, so IMO tough luck on them. (If you like analogies, it's like carving out a block of unassigned IPs for yourself, and then complaining when someone is actually assigned those IPs and wants to use them).<p>The one band they tested is the one that is further away, and therefore easier for devices to reject. They claim it's not a problem for ""over 99% of devices"" when they are at full power there. They concede that operation the the higher frequency band (that LightSquared has licensed) would cause trouble for ""a significant portion of legacy devices.""<p>The root cause of most of the problem (not the part where ultra-precision receivers use bands that aren't theirs) is that the GPS receivers expected things in neighbouring bands to remain quiet, when there was no guarantee that such would happen. This assumption made for easier and cheaper designs for them, and now all this hardware is out there that is susceptible to the interference.",1309478536

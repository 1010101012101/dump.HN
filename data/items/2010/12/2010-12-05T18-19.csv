A lot of Internet warriors seem to be almost zealous in their support of Wikileaks and their belief that the various large-scale releases they have made recently are somehow changing the nature of society and making governments fundamentally more transparent.<p>Wikileaks are quick to say that governments have not identified specific people hurt or killed because of the leaks. However, looking at things from a slightly more neutral point of view, it seems equally true that Wikileaks haven't really told us anything big we didn't already know, or at least suspect. They have created a lot of hype, disruption and embarrassment, but where's the huge smoking gun? I'm in the UK, and so far there has been commentary on our politicians as with many other places, but there's no evidence that our government ordered a hit on Dr David Kelly, or that Tony Blair had more information than we already knew from the public inquiries about whether Iraq really had WMDs, or that our then-government's support for the US action against a lot of popular opinion was a result of some corrupt deal for personal gain by the politicians calling the shots. Frankly, the leaks have so far been rather anti-climactic.<p>Also, just as an aside, the whole ""we offered to let the government help us vet the material"" argument is just transparent politics. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of documents. To even <i>try</i> to vet that data in any useful depth, the time needed from security-cleared and fully informed officials, and the amount of taxpayers' money it would cost would be staggering. Please don't tell me Wikileaks weren't well aware of that. And that's without even getting into the ""we don't negotiate with enemies"" ethics.<p>Given this sort of mess, I don't blame Amazon for not wanting any part of it. The fact that Wikileaks and various embarrassed government officials are having a very public pissing match is not a reason for independent businesses to start taking sides. More pragmatically, given the aforementioned lack of any real substance in the leaks, it is highly likely that the governments are going to win this one, and no business on the scale of Amazon wants to be out of favour with major national governments. There just isn't anything in it for them.",1291574826

As far as understanding the value of technology to people, this list clearly demonstrates that Google is trying to tackle hard problems and products to do just that. Compare this list of side endeavors (besides their obvious core competencies) to those of Facebook. Recent products are talked up as world changing innovations, (Groups, Messages, Places) however they haven't changed the game or significantly added value to their product. Yes these products are young, but in the last few years Facebook has done little to provide this ""value of technology"" besides the initial innovations of News Feed and the Like Button, both of which drew heavily from FriendFeed acquisition as well.

1972119,comment,1971973,1971973,0,0,51Cards,,,"Honestly I don't buy into the Windows is awful line of thought. There a couple of key points you never see with Windows:<p>A. You never see forums posts on the internet saying ""I have notebook XXX, main board XXX, graphics card XXX, will Windows run?""  It just does which is why it will remain the dominant operating system for a long time to come.  MS has the unenviable job of supporting every form of PC style hardware and adapting to it.  Do they do it perfectly?  Of course not but they do it better than anyone else has ever managed to.<p>B. I have a small phone book application I wrote in 1993 on Windows 3.  I still use it today and it hasn't been recompiled in 15+ years at least. I doubt I still have the source (or anything that would compile it). The app is not command line, it's a GUI app, and it still works perfectly. MS has ensured as best they can that any properly written Win app from 16bit on up still runs today. Being a business app developer and seeing the legacy applications many of my large clients have to maintain, this is beyond priceless.<p>I don't deny Windows problems... it's been around so long it is a bit of a hodge podge of UI design, it has been unstable, and it is built around an aging architecture model. Then again I also view these as byproducts of its age and focus on legacy and hardware support.  The performance of hardware is now to a point where virtualizing older versions of the OS for legacy support is practical and I like to think that this will work well for Windows in the future as XP mode has in Win7.  Hopefully MS will really make use of this more going forward.<p>Then again, with where things are heading what operating system you use to access the net is going to become largely irrelevant anyhow.",1291572104

1972116,comment,1971496,1971496,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Counting wars and conflicts seems like a pretty naive way to go about this. You only thought that world peace was inches away when the cold war ended because you weren't actually paying attention to what the cold war was suppressing/controlling. With hindsight, it was fairly obvious that we encounter the apparent 'uptick' in wars. Which really wasn't an uptick in total conflicts, but rather ones which the United States were directly involved in.<p>If you go to the wiki article on anything related to the cold war and look at the cold war section at the bottom where events are broken down by decade, just count the number of 'invasions' and 'civil wars' are listed.<p>It's possible things are getting worse. But this line -really- bugs me: ""I’d rather have the cold war back, because in retrospect people who fight over ideology seem a lot less likely to blow the whole place to smithereens than the ones who fight over religion. ""<p>That -might- be true if you happen to live in the developed world. But just look at all the shit both sides instigated in the developing world during the cold war. A necessary part of the cold war was constantly keeping a hand in the runnings of nearly every developing country to attempt to maintain a status quo.<p>All those toppling of government by the united states since the 50s? Nearly every single of them were motivated at least partly by the containment policy.<p>I'm not trying to argue that those actions were wrong. That's besides the point. The point is that many people (including the author) has the wrong view of the cold war period. Honestly, since I wasn't around then, I can't claim to have 'the correct' view. But I believe the facts speak for themselves. The Cold War period wasn't exactly a happy time for -world-.",1291572064

Thus a shaken Martini is generally slightly stronger than a stirred one.""<p>When a drink is shaken, or stirred, with ice, the cooling happens as the heat from the drink is used for melting the ice, tying together the cooling and the diluting.<p>If the drink was mixed in a completely insulated container (= adiabatically), both shaking and stirring would result in exactly the same amount of ice melting, for exactly the same amount of cooling of the drink. Shaking just makes the heat exchange happen faster, by moving the liquid more over the ice surfaces.<p>In practice I would guess, (1) we rarely have the patience to stir a drink long enough to cool it as cold as a vigorous shake accomplishes, so I'd guess that actually the shaken drinks are colder, thus a little more diluted by water.<p>Or, if we really stir and shake until the same temperature, stirring takes longer, so there is more time for non-adiabatic effects: (2) more time for heat exchange with air, so maybe stirred are more diluted.<p>Then again, (3) usually we stir in a glass container but shake in a metal container, and metal has higher thermal conductivity, so actually cooling both the drink and the container walls would use more heat (=more melted ice) when shaking.<p>I'd guess that effects (1) and (3) are stronger than (2), and thus shaken drinks would be more diluted that stirred.",1291572061

I find a lot of Haskellers confused as to why anyone finds the language difficult and opaque.

Once one is familiar with the language it doesn't matter how dense and difficult it is.<p>The truth is that Haskell <i>is difficult</i> to learn. One does have to start learning from the fundamentals up because the fundamentals of Haskell are so different from everything else that it's difficult to relate to the previous experiences of most people.<p>Contrast this with someone who learned C or some dynamic scripting language like Python from the ground-up.. there are a lot of languages with enough shared grammar and vocabulary out there that they can reach out to them without abandoning their previous notions entirely about how programming is done.<p>Haskell may not exactly ask for one to abandon their notions of computing <i>conceptually</i> but I think it is fair to say that it does ask you to give up all of your previous knowledge of syntax and grammar in order to learn it.",1321368132

I was pleasently surprised to find a video there. Maybe consider renaming this to ""Demo Video"", or even better, ""Intro Video"", which is more descriptive.<p>* I'd even consider moving that movie to the home page. I'm sure lots of internet radio broadcasters know who Robert Klajn is, but he's completely unfamiliar to me, and it comes across as name dropping right up front. I'd have felt much better seeing the demo video up front.<p>* Consider adding a ""wide"" version of the site template for pages that show video and screenshots so that the media can expand beyond the 850-ish pixels you have in the left column. This would be especially impactful for the screenshots, which I found difficult to see at their current size. Ultimately, I discovered that I could click on the photos and view them on Flickr, but it takes a few clicks.<p>Overall a very cool product that encourages creation.",1321367503

I think I stopped using Lisp Machines before generational garbage collection was added to the ones I was using, which made them ""less pauseless"", but Azul's entire approach is novel:<p>Instead of deferring the hard cases as long as you can (e.g. in generational GCs doing collections beyond the nursery) at which point they're likely to be painful, concentrate on the hard cases first and foremost.  Get those right and everything else falls into place.  Here's their CTO discussing that in a short interview: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/azul_pauseless_gc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/azul_pauseless_gc.html</a><p>A relevant quote:<p><i>[...] Our collector really does the only hard thing in garbage collection, but it does it all the time. It compacts the heap all the time and moves objects all the time, but it does it concurrently without stopping the application. That's the unique trick in it, I'd say, a trick that current commercial collectors in Java SE just don't do.<p>Pretty much every collector out there today will take the approach of trying to find all the efficient things to do without moving objects around, and delaying the moving of objects aroundor at least the old objects aroundas much as possible. If you eventually end up having to move the objects around because you've fragmented the heap and you have to compact memory, then you pause to do that. That's the big, bad pause everybody sees when you see a full GC pause even on a mostly concurrent collector. They're mostly concurrent because eventually they have to compact the heap.

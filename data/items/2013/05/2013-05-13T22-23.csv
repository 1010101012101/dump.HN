The bitmap scan plan takes ~15 minutes to run cold, and the index scan takes ~20 seconds cold.

It turned out to be so simple and fun to build that I decided to trash all of the old code base and rewrite it in Go. The performance is great (it runs circles around the Python/Django code (expected)), but what I like is the syntax, and how easy it is to work with it. In my mind, its the right mix of C and Python.

Ignoring the smaller scanning benefits of Go that come about from the more rigid syntax for braces and such, the C preprocessor system introduces a complete nightmare when it comes to requiring multiple passes over the same code, especially for code that is naive about include guards, pre-compiled headers and other ""best practices"".<p>C (and C++ is even worse)  has a lot of very large low hanging fruit to cull when it comes to writing languages with faster compilers.  Whatever speed C compilers have now is due to the geniuses who wrote the compilers and decades of shoulders to stand on, the language is actively working against them at nearly every turn when it comes to compilation speed.<p>That aside, I agree.

But I'm with you on not necessarily wanting the law to punish someone for this kind of negligence.<p>But let's go through our alternatives here for the situation at hand. This isn't a case where some criminal aims to profit from credit card fraud, or where some irreparable injury has occurred to anyone. In those cases you have an obvious need to punish the perpetrator, and there are already separate laws against such things. In this case the primary ""harm"" is to the reputation of a negligent party, and their costs in responding to the consequences of their own security failure. So what are our alternatives?<p>In the first case we can punish AT&T for allowing the vulnerability. However, there is a real problem with doing this: A small penalty will have no effect, and a penalty large enough to motivate AT&T will also be large enough to bankrupt any startup, which would increase risks and compliance costs for small businesses and quite plausibly outweigh the benefit of deterring insecurity. On top of that, if companies are punished for vulnerabilities then they may just not report them at all, even in cases of explicitly malicious attackers, which would go so far as to prevent the third parties affected from trying to mitigate the damage.<p>The second alternative would be to punish the party who conducts an unauthorized but mostly harmless investigation into a vulnerability without the consent of the party who negligently created it. Naturally this may deter some proportion of the people likely to engage in such behavior from doing so. However, that deterrence is not particularly productive, because <i>it leaves the vulnerabilities in place</i>. Someone who harvests email addresses and publishes them to prove the vulnerability shames the negligent party into fixing it before some greater harm occurs, like a more malicious party harvesting the emails to use for a phishing scheme, which achieves the converse of the original: Instead of publishing the vulnerability and causing it to be fixed with minimal harm, you have a secret but significant and continuing harm and the vulnerability may never be exposed or fixed.<p>A third alternative would be to do both: Punish the party that created the vulnerability and the party that demonstrates it. But that's just the worst of both worlds. You deter those who would have the vulnerability fixed and leave it open for exploitation in secret by organized crime or foreign governments, meanwhile you still impose significant legal risk and compliance costs on the economy.<p>Which leaves the alternative of not punishing <i>anyone</i>. In that case the vulnerabilities get published and the corporations are shamed into fixing them. A corporation that repeatedly suffers security vulnerabilities has its reputation destroyed and suffers in the marketplace to the degree that its customers place a value on the security of their data, providing a market-based incentive for good security. Meanwhile ""attackers"" who merely experiment and publish vulnerabilities are encouraged to do more of that work, but those who engage in e.g. fraud are still punished under the specific laws against that class of behavior.<p>Between those four, it seems to me the last is best.",1368483829

They were:<p>* Thomas Drake, an NSA employee who favored ""ThinThread"" instead of the later-adopted ""Trailblazer"" internet surveillance scheme, who then created a Hushmail account and fed classified documents to a reporter from it.<p>* Shamai Leibowitz, an FBI contractor/interpreter, who fed the contents of an cable intercepted from the Israeli embassy to a blogger because he felt it implicated Israel in an attack on Iran.<p>* Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a career civil servant at State who worked on counterproliferation and North Korea and fed classified documents about North Korea to Fox News, and then lied to the FBI about having any contact with journalists.<p>* Bradley Manning<p>* Jeffrey Sterling, who was fired from the CIA, lodged a series of employment law disputes with the CIA, attempted to write a memoir about his time at CIA, and then fed classified details about Iranian counterproliferation to a reporter which put a human intelligence resource at risk.<p>* John Kiriakou, a CIA counterterrorism official who worked in Pakistan, who outed two covert operatives to a reporter (they had allegedly been involved in the Bush-era interrogation program).<p>Of this list, Kiriakou and Drake are sympathetic to me, but every single case here seems like a valid prosecution; when you take a role that requires you to handle the most sensitive data the government handles, you cannot share it with the press expecting not to end up arguing your side of the story in a court of law.

5701791,comment,5700562,5701058,13,0,hosh,,,"It <i>does</i> have more to do with <i>feeling</i> alone.<p>Hermits, monks, nuns, sages, sadhus, ascetics, cultivators, shamans, mind travellers from all around the world of different wisdom traditions typically have essentially the same practice. Each is looking into themselves to gain insights about the world. This insight is at the core of everything:<p><pre><code>    We live in an *illusion* that we are separate from each other.
</code></pre>
This is at the core of the loneliness. To be intimate, to be connected, is to realize that how we are <i>already</i> connected.<p>When you know this, <i>it does not matter whether you are physically isolated or not</i>.<p>This isn't something that special people called monks or nuns can do. This is a capacity in each of us. That capacity is something we call love. Not ""romance"". Love. Love that a child has for his parent, love that a mother and father have for their child. Love among lovers and friends. Love for the people in your community. Love for the strangers you don't know.<p>So of course, ""living alone in the world goes against the grain."" The grain is to be connected. <i>Anyone</i>, lay or not, who separates themselves find themselves alone.<p>Separation comes in many forms. It isn't just physical. Being proud or ashamed is separation. Being proud makes you ""above"" or ""better"" than someone. That's separation. Being ashamed makes you want to hide away. That's separation. Being so angry and hateful of someone that you want to destroy their standing, status, credibility, resources, life -- yeah, that's a form of separation.<p>Being disgusted and averting your eyes from the homeless in the street is separation. Being disturbed and fearful of the mentally ill -- that too is separation. Being repulsed by the ugly and deformed, by the lepers and unclean, yeah, that is separation.<p>Being special: heh, yeah, that's the very essence of separation.<p>We're not ""alone together"". In wanting to be special, to be unique, to have our brand of personality, we want to carve out this little corner of ""me"". And in the very doing so, we create distance.<p>So get in touch with yourself; get in touch with your family and friends. Start with some affection, that's pretty easy :-)",1368483507

I view it as a broken promise, because they never mentioned that they are going to pull this option after releasing it.<p>First of all, I ended up saying to several small business owners ""<i>create an account on Google Apps, it's both free and awesome</i>"".

They are also subject to Google's TOS, so they could get locked out of their accounts by a script that calculated a probability for TOS violations.

5701727,comment,5695781,5696718,1,0,CasimirCelerity,,,"> Opiates do not stop your heart. The notion that every single usage of opium or heroin is like a game of russian roulette, that might stop your heart, is fantasy. Opiates are actually quite safe, as drugs go.<p>They, in large doses, stop your breathing which is close enough and will kill you (like you later said), unlike, say a benzodiazepine which you can take to your hearts content and will just knock you out senseless without killing you (unless you add alcohol or another GABA receptor drug).<p>They also can send you into a hypotensive crisis if you're hypovolemic, which also will kill you. So I would really be hesistant to call them ""quite safe, as drugs go"" because they are definitely on the dangerous spectrum. We could list a ton of drugs I'd rank higher on the safety spectrum than opioids in terms of both short and long-term effects, with opioids only ""redeeming"" quality being their instant reverse agent (naloxone) or partial reverse agents (pentazocine or buprenorphine).",1368482930

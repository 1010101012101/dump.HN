Stop using them!<p>I really wish I could...<p>When I created my SaaS a few years back, I went all out with payment providers.<p>I registered and implemented every single form of online payment I could find. PayPal, AlertPay, PayPay, MoneyBookers, LibertyReserve, Bitcoin. You name it, I made that form of payment available. I even accepted money orders via snail mail.<p>In the ~2 years I gave all of the &quot;other guys&quot; a chance, 99.9% of my payments came via PayPal.<p>I received 1 money order. Perhaps 3 people paid via LibertyReserve. 0 payments from all of the other providers mentioned. And over 5,000 payments via PayPal.<p>Unfortunately, there is no other option if you want to sell stuff online.<p>And this is coming from one of Bitcoins biggest proponents.",1425149987

9124576,comment,9123713,9124374,0,0,dreemkilker,,,"To answer your question about the the salt and the PBKDF2:
salt ensures that the hash of my password is different from someone else&#x27;s, even if we use the same password (or I use the same password on another site). 
Thus, if someone has the hashes, and wants to attack the system, then need to attack each password independently (they can&#x27;t just run a password dictionary through the PKDF2 (or SHA256 in this case - very bad choice)) and then compare the results against all of the password hashes. They have to start with the salt (different for each user), and then run each password guess through the algorithm. Much slower. Much better.<p>Which brings us to PBKDF2 instead of SHA256: SHA256 is designed to be fast. That&#x27;s bad when hashing passwords, because it makes offline dictionary-based attacks faster. Password Derivation functions are designed to be slow. That makes logging on very slightly slower, but makes offline attacks much, much slower.<p>However, doing the encryption in Javascript is a fatal problem: At any time, they can update (or be forced to update) the javascript to send the server my password when I use it, and the only way I can protect myself from this is to audit the code, EVERY TIME I USE IT.",1425149413

9124559,comment,9124176,9124176,0,0,kiyoto,,,"&quot;I wanted to write something that is concise, easy to understand, easy to extend, and reasonably efficient. There is a subtle trade-off between conciseness and extensibility: If we use a very high level language that already has a &quot;neural_network_train&quot; function, we can write very concise code but we lose the ability to change the training algorithm. If we use a very low level language that only provides primitive arithmetic operations, all the algorithm details are exposed and modifiable but the code is bulky and difficult to understand. For a happy medium, the code should reflect the level at which I think of the problem&quot;<p>The tradeoff is not between concision and extensibility, but high- and low-level computations.<p>Even if the language natively implements a &quot;neural_network_train&quot; function, as long as the language also offers low-level primitives to implement all the necessary parts of the neural_network function, the language is no less extensible than the OP&#x27;s suggested alternative. For example, almost 100% of R users use &quot;lm&quot; to run linear regressions, but R has all the necessary pieces to implement the linear regression calculation (either by inverting matrices or running iterative gradient descent algorithms)<p>The OP conflates the library-level abstraction and language-level abstraction. I am with him in that there is a trade off between concision and extensibility w/r/t language-level abstraction. The library-level abstraction is pragmatically important (i.e., you would not use OCaml to run websites) but theoretically uninteresting (Ocaml can certainly express all the needed computation for a web server).",1425149043

Search is a few orders of magnitude better than the junk mail classification, at least for me.  I don&#x27;t know what algorithms they use for junk classification, but here are some observations:<p>1) I mark 100% of the emails from a particular sender or with a particular subject line as junk, yet the junk classifier still puts emails from that sender or with that subject in my inbox.  This is the low-hanging fruit -- the stuff that is so obvious that it is spam that a human can figure it out without looking at the message body at all, yet Thunderbird can&#x27;t seem to get it right no matter how much you train it.  I can only guess that they are placing too much weight on the body content (which is easily padded with hidden text to con the algorithm) when a bad sender/subject should trump whatever is in the body.<p>2) Emails from people that I&#x27;ve emailed in the past sometimes end up in the junk folder.  I thought they were supposed to be whitelisted automatically (by automatically being appended to some special section of your address book).<p>3) I&#x27;ve implemented message filters to detect certain words like our product name and move the incoming message to a high-priority folder, yet messages that should match the filter still end up in the junk folder on rare occasions (and, yes, I have it configured to run the filter before junk classification is applied -- I&#x27;m assuming that junk classification should not be applied if a filter moves the message out of the inbox).<p>4) It sometimes seems to just stop learning, so I have to reset and retrain the junk classifier or it gets to the point where the only emails that it recognizes as being junk are the ones in a foreign language.",1425147119

You mean the far-right anarcho-capitalist who considers one of the provisions of the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional[2], said that criticizing BP for trying to get out of paying for their own oil spill was &quot;un-American ... criticism of business&quot;[3], fought to defend tax-evaders who stash their money in Switzerland[4], and says that he&#x27;s &quot;not a firm believer in democracy&quot;[5]?<p>The problem with calling Rand Paul &quot;far-right&quot; is that he isn&#x27;t anything like Dick Cheney. Calling someone &quot;far-right&quot; who agrees with the Green Party on so many social issues is just... odd.<p>So let&#x27;s go through your list for a second, because it&#x27;s kind of unreasonable to criticize someone for taking positions that are essentially correct. Forcing employers to hire people they don&#x27;t want to is pretty clearly a violation of the freedom to associate, regardless of whether you think it&#x27;s a good idea. It <i>is</i> political pandering for politicians to lambast a company which is taking full responsibility for a disaster and doing the cleanup by the book. Blocking a privacy-invading treaty that requires companies to provide the government with private financial records without any suspicion of wrongdoing is entirely the right thing to do. And the idea that democracy can lead to tyranny of the majority is so old and well-established that I&#x27;m not sure how you even expect to question its veracity.<p>Moreover, the idea that Elizabeth Warren is &quot;centrist&quot; is as wrong as the idea that Rand Paul is far-right. Centrist doesn&#x27;t mean anything. If you can describe a candidate who agrees with Republicans and Democrats on half of the issues each as &quot;centrist&quot; but apply the same label to someone who takes exactly the opposite position on everything then the label is useless. It typically gets applied to the professional politicians who never take a position on anything and therefore seem to be inoffensive to everyone, which is exactly the opposite of what Elizabeth Warren is.<p>Elizabeth Warren will tell you what she thinks. You may not always agree with it, but at least you know what it is, which is more than you can say for Clinton, but really quite similar to Rand Paul. Which is why Paul vs. Warren would be interesting -- the campaigns would be spectacular because they&#x27;re both candidates who take actual positions on things.<p>But Elizabeth Warren has stated unequivocally that she&#x27;s not running.",1425147008

Assume the average cost of a room is $200 and you&#x27;re talking $24B in gross revenue. Of that AirBnb takes 3% ... working out to ~$720M. Now here&#x27;s the beauty ... to generate that $720M AirBnb doesn&#x27;t need that many employees. If we go on LinkedIn there are 2,257 employees listing AirBnB as their employer. Let&#x27;s say average cost is $400K that&#x27;s $90M. Say there&#x27;s another $100M in expenses (server hosting costs, office space, etc). We can see how AirBnb could be generating $500M in profit. Slap a 40x multiple on that and we&#x27;re at $20B.<p>Furthermore there are some incredibly appealing characteristics. One, expenses won&#x27;t grow with revenue. If AirBnb goes from 120M to 240M bookings their expenses are relatively fixed. They&#x27;ll have to add additional server capacity but the for the most part that will just be pure profit.<p>Two, and more important, they&#x27;re got a tremendous competitive position. The degree of customer captivity is highly under-appreciated. Once someone makes an account and establishes their credibility on one platform they&#x27;re going to be reluctant to go through the effort to do that on another platform. Combined with their market leading position it will make difficult for anyone to unseat AirBnb.<p>So as I said before, I think what&#x27;s interesting is figuring out what serious investors see that justifies a $20B valuation.",1425146556

This lesson was learned long ago about assembly languages and machine code: If you could program the Burroughs Whatzit 220, you could <i>not</i> program the Data General WhizJig 3000, and all the software ecosystem you (and others) had written over the years became obsolete when technology advanced.  This was a large part of why programming languages were invented, and why they were always meant to be platform and <i>vendor</i> independent – so that this would not happen again¹.<p>It’s possible that we are due for another generation of developers to make the same journey of discovery of why vendor-specific technology solutions have larger drawbacks than what is initially apparent.<p>① This is also, incidentally, why Unix proliferated as an operating system – it was and is, for all intents and purposes, a vendor-independent platform for development at the <i>operating system</i> level.",1418295588

Right now we&#x27;re using CSSTransitionGroup, but I expect we&#x27;ll move to a JS-based transition method (possibly with tween-state) so you can do controlled or partial transitions (required for things like drawers or swipe-from-left to go back)<p>We have spent a lot of time looking at react-router though, and are using it on other projects, and are / will be borrowing quite a few things :)",1418295438

If the height were to go the other way i.e; decrease, then you&#x27;ll put your foot down hard trying to place the next step. That change in step height is in fact a change in <i>frequency</i>, and you&#x27;re forced to adjust your pace abruptly by adjusting the timing (phase) of your subsequent steps.<p>Is there a &#x27;gentler&#x27; way to adjust the phase? Now say you&#x27;re wearing some kind of spongy sandals that can take up the slack, so at every step you <i>increasingly</i> sense that the frequency has changed. This accumulation indicates that phase is mathematically the <i>integral</i> of instantaneous frequency with respect to time.<p>We now put this integral in a feedback loop. Then, if the staircase step height changes suddenly we use the <i>slow</i> accumulated phase to produce an error signal that gradually drives the frequency generator (in this case, our brain) to adjust the pace of our step till we get in <i>lock</i>-step.<p>The actual dynamics is more complicated, involving a non-linear frequency capture (which linearizes the system) and then the <i>slower</i> phase lock. You can see this in the waveforms in the original post.",1418295201

Furthermore peer review is absolutely NOT about reproducibility, it is a prerequisite that says that it MIGHT be worth trying to reproduce this work or work contingent on these results being valid.

A layman could understand it well enough, a physicist can understand it as well (the &#x27;detailed&#x27; information hasn&#x27;t been deleted or mangled by a journalist not understanding what they&#x27;re writing, just presented clearly).  And the graphs they show actually tell you what you want to know.  Fantastic.",1418292191

You fork Go under a new name, create a community with the same objectives as yours around it, be competitive and develop the language further and then reap the satisfaction. If there is a significant need for your ideas I&#x27;m sure the developers will join you (otherwise you will have the best proof that your idea is just not good enough for many others). Personally I&#x27;m very glad and grateful for the product of a tremendous amount of man hours I receive for free even if I too have ideas (that don&#x27;t overlap perfectly with Go) about how a better language should be.",1418292071

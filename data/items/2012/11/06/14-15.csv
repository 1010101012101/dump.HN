Also, there not very much you can do really wrong if you regularly push to a remote repository, as long as you don't push with force.<p>Sure, but that's not really an excuse for git to have such a confusing and possibly destructive command line. I'm not a GUI person at all, but the times I had to lookup 20 different ways that 'git reset' worked, or had to google what on earth the apparently random combination of words like refspec, remote, origin, branch and non-bare actually meaned have been enough to drive me to a GUI tool. Now I'm much happier and actually enjoy working with git. Obviously when you are only pulling and pushing from master, there's not much that can go wrong, but if that's all you do, Subversion would do the trick just as well. The CLI usability completely falls apart when you start rebasing, merging and cleaning up WIP commits.<p>A tool like Mercurial proves that DVCS systems do not have to have a confusing CLI, in all the years I've been using it, I've never felt compelled to use a GUI. Too bad the Mercurial back-end is so slow.",1352213929

Then they learn C++.  It's hard because it's C++.  From that, they infer that languages are complex, difficult to learn, and maybe impossible to implement.<p>This is true of languages that desperately try to be the proverbial hammer. That's why we call them ""general purpose"".  On the other hand, more specialized languages are often much easier to handle: Of the top of my head, I can think of Make, Lua, and OMeta.<p>I learned the basics of make in a few days.

4748609,comment,4743425,4745119,1,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"Ah!  A post actually related to the argument!  SO now we can have a discussion.<p>Dolphins are of course very 'dumb'; its taken years of hard research to come up with any evidence of intelligence, and its all indirect. Why we even bothered? Probably because of their large-ish brain, which turns out is an elaborate visual cortex (ok, sonar cortex, same thing).<p>They play; they have family units, at least for a while. Is this intelligence? Crows do all that too; many other mammals also.<p>Caring for humans is anecdotal.  My favorite one is, people adrift from shipwreck get pushed to shore by dolphins. This suffers from observer bias - dolphins love to play with floaty things, and push them around. All the sailors pushed out to sea don't tell their storey.<p>May dolphins be intelligent? Ok, sure. But as they don't have societies, inventions, any more language than many birds, their intelligence is very much more similar to other 'lower' animals than human.<p>Maybe its a different kind of intelligence? That's reaching, kind of making up things to fit a desired conclusion, but ok. Then the 3rd argument in my original post: its a kind of intelligence that doesn't extend to saving one anothers' lives.  If even one escaped dolphin mentioned ""I got out of there; all my family are missing, plus two other pods I know of; maybe we should stay away from that bay"", we would have fabulous evidence of an intelligent society sharing the planet with us.  Observably not happening, so one could conclude (I never said I conclude this, thats your projection) that they are of an intelligence too small to permit that communication. In fact, occams razor damands this conclusion.",1352213666

It seems rather odd that Microsoft would destroy one of the major reasons the OS has remained so prevalent and successful: backwards compatibility.  This is much the same reason why Intel has never deprecated instructions from x86.  If they bring out a new OS that makes it so we can't install our old apps because of the Windows Store, that just gives people more reason and time to consider a different option like Mac or Linux.  I just don't think Microsoft would risk such a thing.<p>On the other hand, I'm not surprised to see the lockdown on mobile/tablet applications.  People are already used to this and haven't yet been introduced to true freedom on their mobile devices (besides those of us who have rooted our phones).

4748553,comment,4747910,4748490,7,0,jemfinch,,,"First, TCP and DNS don't come into it: they both piggyback on IP (TCP directly; DNS via UDP in typical use), so IP is all that's really relevant.<p>BGP is how routers communicate with each other.  Every major edge router for a network is typically connected to many other edge routers for other networks.  Each router announces what amounts to their complete routing table: i.e., for every IPv4/IPv6 address that they know how to route, they announce what networks it traverse on the way to the destination.<p>When a router is deciding which router an IP packet should hop to next, it looks at the packet's destination IP address and consults an in-memory data structure that it has constructed based on the BGP announcements of the routers to which it's connected.  Modulo refining nuances (MED/PREF), it looks for two things:<p>1. It routes the packet according to the most specific network it saw announced.  If it sees a packet destined for 1.2.3.4, and one connected router A is announcing a route for 1.2.3.0/24, and another connected router B is announcing a route for 1.2.0.0/16, it will pass along the packet to router A, all other things being equal.<p>2. As a tiebreaker for announcements with the same network specificity, it looks at the ""AS path"": the set of networks that the packet will traverse.  It picks the router with the shortest path: the least number of traversed networks.<p>So the answer to your direct question is that BGP is ""somewhere else"": it's what routers use to communicate to each other ""How will you route this IP packet?"" and then make reasonable decisions about how they should send packets around the network.",1352213140

We graduated from Computer Science of NUS in 2006 and startup is unheard of during that time. Below is my opinion of ""startups vs talent"" in Singapore.<p>1. There are very good CS guys around in Singapore, but most of them stayed back at school to do PHD. The reason is very simple: Singapore IT jobs have little coding skills needed and most of the time it is just project management (with most of the coding jobs outsourced) or support work (calling up vendors, standby when server down etc). There is no way for us to grow our talent once out of school. College is the last place where we can do technically challenging stuff, so those competent CS guys prefer to stay in school.<p>2. Our govt is infact the biggest employer of our IT graduates, doing the stuff of Point 1 above.<p>3. Despite all the woohoo that the startup scene in Singapore is trying to make itself into, it is really quite pathetic here. Cost is high, funding is little, market is not in this region too. Naivety is still the main driving force of startups in Singapore. Meaning those that want to startup in Singapore are probably really first-timers that do not know what they are getting into (especially fresh grads out of sch), and probably understood startup as anything that has the mixture of ""tech+biz""<p>4. Companies do not value startup founders that failed, meaning if founders want to find re-employment in other companies, it is doubly hard for them cause employers do not understand what do startups do and how their experience in startups can contribute in anything. Startup founders that failed in Singapore is treated like a bankrupt equivalent.<p>So with job market that is generally not technically challenge, and startups that are technically challenge but not making it at all, it is simple to see why ""talent"" is not found in Singapore",1352212981

It has pads for two RFM12B module, a Z-Wave module, and an EnOcean module as well as a socket for an XBee module. They also included a few nice extras such as a real time clock and a temperature sensor.<p>However, you have to scroll to the bottom to see that the remaining ""supported protocols"" such as UMTS, 3G, 4G, LTE, WiFi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, X10, etc. are supported ""via USB"" or over the ethernet port.

As another analogy, a company rejected by one regulator can get a second opinion from another, just as academics can submit to multiple journals if the first one rejects a paper. Indeed, much FDA review is already subcontracted out to expert panels from these institutions anyway. In return for doing approvals, Harvard Med or Mayo would get the user fees authorized under PDUFA/MDUFA that would otherwise go to FDA. People could wait for a drug to be approved by the FDA, or they could take a drug which had Harvard Medical School's stamp of approval.<p>These two proposals - opt-out and multiple regulators - are relatively simple to implement yet will cause huge changes in the system.<p>Right now we have a crude version of both in that a wealthy patient can opt-out of the FDA by flying to Europe, and a company can to some extent have multiple regulators by going for the EU's CE Mark first rather than the FDA. Indeed, within the medical devices space they now say ""Europe first"" just like internet startups today say ""mobile first"".<p>But it would be better if a patient could opt-out without flying to another country, and a company could get a second opinion from a different regulator without launching outside the US.",1352211117

I 'get' that you have the benefit of being able to just 'code' and have it run without you touching anything, but what about your content?<p>A database on Heroku and other similar offerings such as AppFog, AppHarbor, etc, are really expensive. I'd rather pay 15$/month starting out and install everything I need with simple commands - and I'm not even a Linux-guy! Imagine what a veteran Linux guy would do!<p>Don't you lose too much control? The last time I tried to deploy a Rails app on Heroku, I couldn't figure out where to save and well, ""admin"" user uploads on my website. (I was building a 9Gag clone to practice) and it turns out you cannot save data on a Heroku app. You need to pay for YET ANOTHER service such as Amazon content hosting.<p>So for a full stack you're looking at paying about 80$/month, that includes Heroku, Database, and content hosting. For a lean, mean startup I'd rather just pay 15$ for a VPS and handle things my way.<p>It's not like it's that hard. If and WHEN I need a service such as Heroku for load balancing, etc when my app reaches critical mass I'll be able to afford it. Not before.",1352210780

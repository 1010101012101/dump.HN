6268483,comment,6266863,6266863,14,0,tytso,,,"&quot;Stack ranking&quot; as it has been reported to be used at Microsoft, is multiple things conflated together.  Some of these things are, by themselves, not necessarily bad.   The problem is that people hear the words &quot;stack ranking&quot;, and immediately jump to &quot;eeeeevil&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;s what killed Microsoft&quot;, and &quot;Google does stack ranking, it must be doomed / I&#x27;d never want to work there&quot;, which is sloppy thinking.<p>Let&#x27;s taking what people are calling &quot;stack ranking&quot; apart.   The first aspect of stack ranking, is simply forcing people to make decisions about what things/object/people are more important/better/etc. than others.   This can be a valuable technique.   For example, there is a very useful testing instrument I took a while back that took a list of twenty values, e.g., &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;loyalty&quot;, &quot;honesty&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;family&quot;, etc., and asked me to force rank sets of five of these values in order of which I thought were most important to least important (i.e., DNI Clapper would rank &quot;honesty&quot; below that of &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;security&quot;; others might make different choices --- there were no right answers).  By taking twenty or thirty of these different subsets, ranked in the order of which I thought were most valuable, a computer program would allow me to see which values I considered most important, and which I considered least important.  This was a valuable thing, and so the technique of doing forced ranking is and of itself a useful thing.<p>The second technique is that of trying to normalize employee performance review ratings across departments --- whether using a bell curve, or some other technique.  Again, in isolation, this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  Some managers might grade their employees more harshly, and some might be soft touches.  Within a departmental level, it may be easier for a manager to argue that his team were all stars, but how do you deal with the question of an entire department using a harsher or more lenient grading system?  One of the simplest things to do is to use a bell curve --- which may or may not be fair, especially if the company says  (and all companies will claim this) that they hire the &quot;best and brightest&quot;.<p>The final component is what do you actually do with this normalized ranking number?   If you really believe that everyone you&#x27;ve hired are the &quot;best and the brightest&quot;, then firing the lowest scoring 5% is insane.  If however you don&#x27;t have confidence in your hiring mechanisms, such that some duds make it past your hiring screens, then firing the lowest 5% may make a lot of sense; you want to get rid of them before they do (more) damage.   (BTW, this is is why I believe a hiring system which tries extremely hard to avoid hiring duds, at the expense of sometimes failing to hire qualified individuals, is extremely important; it has its downsides, but it&#x27;s very much a necessary evil, because the alternatives are far worse.)<p>What about using this number as an input to compensation?  Here, using a normalized bell curve may make more sense.  Certainly if you only have fixed pot of money to use for salary increases and equity refreshes, you want to make sure that your top performances get rewarded.<p>What about promotions?  For junior engineers, if they are growing in their job, presumably they should get promoted as they demonstrate that they are getting better at programming and understanding the company&#x27;s systems and development environment.  Using the performance rating would certainly be one metric, but evaluating that person&#x27;s proficiency and results should probably be just as important, if not more so.<p>The point is that just doing a &quot;stack rank&quot;, whether as an input to the performance review mechanism (i.e., asking other employees to stack rank their peers, and then having some algorithm to merge those inputs together, and taking into account controversial rankings where multiple colleagues had differing opinions about whether person A was more or less effective than person B) or whether managers are forced to stack rank all of the employees in their department, is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>The problem comes from what do you _do_ with the stack ranking after you&#x27;ve generated it.  It&#x27;s that which can drive a company&#x27;s culture, either positively or negatively.  So my suggestion to Microsoft employees (other than to consider a career at Google :-), is to not rail against stack ranking per se, but to point out some of the negative effects of some of the things are done with the stack rank after it has been generated.  Perhaps, if your HR people are at all competent, they might be more amenable to your suggestions.  Or, maybe you&#x27;d be better off considering another company altogether, in which case my first suggestion still stands.  :-)",1377347717

I suppose it wasn&#x27;t you but the editors who picked it. But your name is still associated with it.<p>Here is my problem with this cover<i>. Just like the NYT picture with the Model S getting towed, it creates a bad image of the car and Tesla in peoples mind. Not just electric cars in general but Tesla. And I have a problem with this. Thats not because I have stock in Tesla, I don&#x27;t and not because I&#x27;m a Musk, Tesla and SpaceX enthusiast, I am. I have a problem with this because, as it stands right now, Teslas goal and mission is aligned with progress and a brighter future for humanity and the planet. This is in opposition to most big car manufactures. Like you, I worked for one so I know that most employers there DON&#x27;T GIVE SHIT about humanity or the planet. The people at Tesla do and the results so far speak for them. You can argue whatever you want in your article. You can not deny that Tesla is trying to improve the status quo by pushing forward the state of the art. They are the bright side of the force and Detroit, Munich, Wolfsburg etc. are the dark side. \nAfter having read your article I will say that it is well written and researched and I agree with many points. However, this does not change my opinion about what I wrote above, which is about the picture of the Tesla car on the dirty coal hill. Seeing you and IEEE (which I&#x27;m now glad not to be a member of) attack Tesla in such a dirty way hurts.<p>Your main point seems to be that \n&quot;Focusing only on greenhouse gases, however important, misses much of the picture.&quot;<p>And, I couldn&#x27;t agree more. However, reducing greenhouse gas production is an important goal, and like destroying the rainforest or wiping out species, the damage is almost impossible to revert. We keep polluting the atmosphere with gasoline cars every day.  \nYes, mining for resources like metal does hurt our planet. However, I can not imagine how we can progress in the future without more mining. Can you?\nSoftware can&#x27;t solve all our problems, neither can timber. We need those metals.\nMaybe, we can mine asteroids one day, but until then all we can do, is make sure that mining happens with minimum damage to the environment and miners and that no precious resources get lost. That is, we need to build products with a focus on long product life and ease of repair and recycle them once they die for good.<p>&quot;Compounds such as lithium, copper, and nickel must be coaxed from the earth and processed in ways that demand energy and can release toxic wastes. And in regions with poor regulations, mineral extraction can extend risks beyond just the workers directly involved. Surrounding populations may be exposed to toxic substances through air and groundwater contamination.&quot;<p>Yes, so how about we work on solving these problems, which relate to pretty much every product we produce? Should be very doable. But, why pick out electric cars?<p>I also have a problem with the general tenor of the article:\n&quot;Are electric cars a sleight of hand that allows peace of mind for those who are already comfortable at the expense of intensifying asthma, heart problems, and radiation risks among the poor and politically disconnected?&quot;<p>Im sorry to say, but many of the arguments remind me of the well meaning &#x27;environmentalists&#x27; who killed the maglev train in Germany, arguing that it was too expensive, needed too many resources like copper and was incompatible with the existing rail network. These people fail to see, that real progress requires heavy investment and does not immediately lead to a new optimum but takes time to mature.<p>Given things as they are and likely will be for long time, that is many people want cars, Tesla improves the status quo by leading us away from fossil fuels. They do so by starting with luxury cars, simply because it seems to be the only viable option to finance such an expensive investment in R&D. Weather the problem of pollution during production can be significantly improved in the future might be debatable. But personally, I&#x27;m sure that Tesla will do much better than what the paper estimates for 2030.<p>&quot;As for greenhouse-gas emissions and their influence on future climate, the researchers didnt ignore those either. The investigators, like many others who have probed this issue, found that electric vehicles generally produce fewer of these emissions than their gasoline- or diesel-fueled counterpartsbut only marginally so when full life-cycle effects are accounted for. The lifetime difference in greenhouse-gas emissions between vehicles powered by batteries and those powered by low-sulfur diesel, for example, was hardly discernible.&quot;<p>Does this take into account that todays cars are designed to have a artificial short life time in order to increase profit?\nYes, the battery life time of a Tesla is short despite best efforts. But is it naive to believe that their life time and especially ease of refurbishing and recycling will improve?<p>&quot;At the end of their useful lives, batteries can also pose a problem. If recycled properly, the compounds are rather benignalthough not something youd want to spread on a bagel. But handled improperly, disposed batteries can release toxic chemicals. Such factors are difficult to measure, though, which is why they are often left out of studies on electric-car impacts.&quot;<p>How about we make sure this won&#x27;t happen then? How can this be a sensible argument against electric cars? You can make the same argument against cell phones vs landlines or laptops vs PCs. How can we progress if every new technology has to face such arguments? It&#x27;s not like old batteries are not nuclear waste.<p>&quot;All of the aforementioned studies compare electric vehicles with petroleum-powered ones. In doing so, their findings draw attention away from the broad array of transportation options availablesuch as walking, bicycling, and using mass transit.&quot;<p>No. This simply won&#x27;t work in the foreseeable future. Unless we radically change our way of living, especially in the US, people won&#x27;t be able to do away with their car. I don&#x27;t speak for myself. I&#x27;ve never owned a car. Almost all my transportation is walking, biking and trains. I have a year pass for the Swiss railway, even avoid buses when possible and haven&#x27;t been on an airplane in years. But for most people in the world this is not an option.<p>If we want to solve the transportation and other efficiency problems we need to live in ever denser places. I am all for that, especially if we return the freed space to nature and don&#x27;t use it to farm more plants and meat. Fortunately, there is a world wide trend towards urbanization. Meat production however is an increasing problem. \nAnyway, we can not force it! That would be inhuman. Clearly the best way to heal the planet is to wipe out humanity. Otherwise, there is a trade off between peoples freedom and opportunities versus environmental protection. And if we don&#x27;t want to make a  &#x27;big leap forward&#x27; like Mao, it will take very, very long until the average human lives as dense as, say, a Swiss today. And even that doesn&#x27;t lead to the required efficiency with todays technology and standard of living. So, changing our way of life alone won&#x27;t do it, we need technological progress.<p>I agree that Tesla does not solve the most important environmental problems of today. But I would say that it is one of the most shining examples of progress in the field of transportation and of how much can be achieved by being bold, ignoring the naysayers and fighting big mega corps which have anything in mind but the betterment of our world. Please, support them, even if you have objections!<p>I think your thesis is an important one and yes we need to figure out how to best save our environment. I believe for instance, that preserving the rain forest, wild life areas in general and finding alternatives to todays meat production are more important. If anyone has new ideas on how to tackles those, I would love to hear them! I&#x27;m also keen to hear arguments what the most pressing environmental issues of our time are.<p></i> The IEEE Spectrum print version has a big coal dump with a half covered Tesla Models S on top of it.",1377347178

8159129,comment,8158076,8158892,1,0,msane,,,"I was thinking about this. Straightforward parking is easy to automate. With big-rig parking there are a lot of really variable situations around loading bays. Often ramps and poles and dumpsters that could potentially roll around. I think of a lot of suburban shopping complexes in the middle of residential areas where neighborhood kids may be playing in the lot. So yes, I could see parking needing to be human-supervised. Though not necessarily even needing to be by someone in the truck. Perhaps just by someone at the receiving area. Probably an employee of the receiving bay who has a special license. When the truck arrives they have to &quot;authorize&quot; the parking, which acknowledges they inspected the the loading area and will watch the truck perform docking.<p>Whether there is someone in the truck at all times is a hard prediction. I also think that these trucks will have remote operation override, which was mentioned elsewhere on this thread (even as an alternative to / cultural introduction to / slippery slope for - full automation). Remote operation is the ideal solution for any kind of exception, short of failure of the remote operation system :P",1407656193

To establish causality what you do is develop hypothesis for mechanisms of causality, identify intermediate events that may be observable if the mechanism hypothesis is valid and observe for those events.

It helpfully pointed out that, since California was experiencing a drought that year, we shouldn&#x27;t be using so much water.<p>It <i>also</i> gave the actual rainfall statistics for the current and past year (approximated but basically accurate in my memory): that year, we&#x27;d received 20% of the average annual rainfall.

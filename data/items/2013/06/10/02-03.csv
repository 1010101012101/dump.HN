5852040,comment,5851185,5851652,28,0,leoc,,,"This is just it. This time last week it was public knowledge that (for example) Google complied with FISA 702 orders. Now it&#x27;s public knowledge that Google complies with FISA 702 orders, using a workflow-automation system. There are hints of extra reasons to be more worried than before, but so far it seeems they&#x27;re all either speculative or disputed:<p>(I&#x27;ll keep talking about Google specifically just to narrow things down for now.)<p>* NYT suggested that FISA orders can be broad and shallow (&quot;a broad sweep for intelligence, like logs of certain search terms&quot;) instead of narrow and deep (eg. everything on person or company X), but CNET&#x27;s source contradicted that <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5845878"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5845878</a> .<p>* The Washington Post used language which suggested that Google&#x27;s lawyers may have been taken out of its FISA-702-order-execution loop altogether, but NYT contradicts that and Google has denied it <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5847846"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5847846</a> .<p>* The Verizon mega-warrant suggests that NSA might be gathering data under similarly broad FISA orders, something that (like broad-and-shallow orders) would make &quot;no direct access&quot; a lot less meaningful, but that&#x27;s been denied by Google <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5847959"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5847959</a> and the various anonymous sources seem to be contradicting it too.<p>* The NYT article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-...</a> seemed to hint at the possiblity that the Google lawyers processing FISA orders could be suffering some kind of reverse regulatory capture or that Larry Page and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond could have lost track of the extent and nature of what they were approving. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any specific evidence for that though.<p>One thing that does seem to be true is that if you make it more convenient for the NSA to get data under FISA 702 orders it will respond by getting a lot more of it. Apparently the NSA&#x27;s PRISM stack boasts of a 63% increase in the number of communications obtained in 2012 from Google <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-n...</a> (and much larger increases at other companies). Still, it seems the PRISM system hasn&#x27;t - or at least, hasn&#x27;t yet! - facilitated an order-of-magnitude or game-changing increase in the scale of FISA 702 snooping. Overall there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any great change in what we think we know <a href=""http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2013/05/fisacases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2013/05/fisaca...</a> about that.<p>So, unless some of those hinted worries are true, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything very big that Larry Page could have brought to our attention that wasn&#x27;t public knowledge last week already. The biggest news is probably the increase in the scale of the data requested, and if Page cared enough about that he could presumably just have done a Twitter and declined to build a semi-automatic pipeline...<p>(IANAL or anything else.)",1370833141

5852031,comment,5851791,5851972,3,0,EthanHeilman,,,"There are levels, but the danger is that some person with sensitive information may communicate the information using an insecure service. For instance someone might remark that the military appears to be building a large underground structure near their farm, the US could then use this information to locate a newly build ICBM silo.<p>The levels of action that a nation could take to protect itself are:<p>1. They could train people who have access to sensitive information not to use any US service. This is what the US has done asking some members of the intelligence community to not use Skype and other services due to worries about its insecurity. This is probably common training for handling sensitive information in most nations.<p>2. They could filter such services at government offices, schools and sensitive sites. For instance no company can get defense contracts unless they have a policy that prevents their employees from using gmail. This is probably the most likely additional action that will taken and it will hurt US business.<p>3. They could filter such services at the national level. China (1 billion people) already does this, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Russia started. It&#x27;s unlikely to happen on a global scale but each country that bans another US service hurts the economy.<p>We saw this happen with US crypto export controls, the market spoke and companies began switching to non-US software.",1370832940

Were in a highly dynamic language. We want nice things. Or, we could create setters and getters using the new ES5 syntax  but thats not available everywhere (pre-IE9, for instance), and, I would argue, is too unwieldy to apply as a rule.<p>You want an easy way to create accessors?

And if you&#x27;re prone to typing `[]` when you mean `{}` (understandable if you&#x27;ve come from a language where they have different meanings), it&#x27;s possible you should do the more conspicuous thing and use `new Array` and `new Object` instead.<p>> Nothing is an object<p>No. What the author is really talking about that by default, there aren&#x27;t &quot;methods&quot; with class-bound scope.

Snowden is trusting Greenwald&#x27;s discretion on what gets published, Manning trusted Wikileaks on what would be published (and recall that Wikileaks did go on to redact a lot of what Manning leaked).

I don&#x27;t think the two are so markedly dissimilar.

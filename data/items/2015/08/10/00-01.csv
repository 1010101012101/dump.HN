There are trends I believe PG is missing.<p>Today, we consider the .COM to be the true, authentic, creme dela creme. However, available .COM domains are becoming harder and harder to find, while there has been an explosion in new TLDs such as .ly, .io, .pro, .guru, .camp, .rentals, .pub, .management etc.<p>More and more, we will be seeing startups and large companies with alternative domain names which they will promote online, in magazines, on TV, etc. It will be common to see alternative TLDs. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the next Super Bowl had a couple ads which included an alternative TLD. Marketing is about rising above the noise and right now a .PRO is much more noticeable than a .COM.<p>Many commenters and PG acknowledge that while .COM names are less valuable today than they were just a few years ago, they are still <i>perceived</i> to be very valuable. However, that is less and less true for the younger generation (which is the trend I believe PG is missing). As they grow up seeing ly, .io, .pro, .guru, etc., a .COM will have no more inherent authenticity than any other TLD. Would they really be more attracted to a magazine/tv/online ad with sportsshoe.com than to sportsshoe.pro? More willing to eat lunch at goodfood.com over goodfood.pub? More likely to attend bestsummercamp.com over bestsummer.camp? More likely to download a fun app from puzzle.com over puzzle.app?<p>As a potential investor, does spending time and money securing a .COM really signal someone&#x27;s dedication and company strength? Should a startup founder really spend a lot of money to secure a .COM so the company appears stronger? Seems like a false metric.",1439168385

Fruit smoothies are probably about as bad as soda (except you get a  bit of fiber, and some micro-nutrients) in terms of the affect on your blood sugar.  HFCS is only part of the problem...<p>The bigger thing is the human (and all, really) body is complex and varied.  A lot of things play into the nutritional needs of a person.  We&#x27;ve also had a lot of migration and mixed heritage the past couple hundred years, much broader and deeper than any point in history before it.  It usually takes some time for a society to optimize for certain food sources.<p>Even then, we have some vary diverse cultures coming together (and I do love great fusion foods)...  Combined with mixed family allergies, and a lot of mono-crops and ever limited diets by huge swaths of society.  The body does adapt, as it stands though, most people are too sedentary (myself included)...<p>Once metabolic syndrom sets in, it gets very complicated... I&#x27;m at a point where a bit of heavy starch (bread, pasta) throws me off for a couple days... many grains will mess me up too... if I have more than around 100g of net carbs a day, I have issues.  Most people have way more than 100g of just sugar any given day.<p>The &quot;food pyramid&quot; is mostly lopsided.. and subsidies mostly push some of the worst things for us.  In general, we get too much grains, more meat than needed, not enough vegetables and fruits (I mean the likes of peppers, tomatoes, squash and cucumber here)...  far too many heavily refined foods (from vegetable oils that are really unnatural, to fruit juices).  Many people don&#x27;t gain weight or really show it, but are just as unhealthy from their diets.<p>I&#x27;m really bad at sticking with what works best for me... because I like pasta, and bread, and rice, and potatoes.  I just know I shouldn&#x27;t have them anymore, and when I do (a couple times a week) I <i>really</i> feel it.  Not to mention that even if I go weeks with really minimal carbs/sugars, my body is really efficient with gluconeogenesis and starts creating a lot of keytones, which has its&#x27; own issues.<p>It all sucks.  I&#x27;m over 350#, and excercise is all but impossible with my bad knees... it&#x27;s all I can do to not gain more weight.  Since starting Invokana, my weight and blood sugar levels are at least stable (but elevated), but getting farther is difficult to say the least.  I wish I know a lot of what I know today a few decades ago... I would have never started drinking &quot;diet&quot; soda, which is way worse in a lot of ways, and also would have cut most of the carbs back when it would have made more of a difference.",1439167537
10032150,comment,10031286,10031286,0,0,rathereasy,,,"At the end of the article, the author mentions how we could possibly find other designs of mathematics. Well, some people already have!<p>Some mathematicians did not like the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition A, either A is true or A is false. So they invented intuitionistic logic, which is normal logic without the excluded middle, and started rewriting mathematical proofs in this new system. Turns out there&#x27;s a lot of stuff you can prove in intuitionistic logic.<p>Some mathematicians did not like the axiom of choice. One of the consequences of this axiom is that every subset of the real numbers has a least element according to some ordering. Think about it, what is the least element of {1/n : n >= 1} ? Who knows! So what did they do? Some people found it so weird they either replaced it with a weaker axiom or a contradictory one.<p>There&#x27;s even syntax arguments in mathematics! What&#x27;s the derivative of a function f? is it f&#x27;(x) or df/dx ? Is multiplication represented by a dot (.) or a cross (x) or by a juxtaposition of expressions?<p>Sometimes we use big existing proofs in the middle of a proof to save time. And sometimes we use the big proof to prove something far simpler than the big proof. This creates a big dependency and some people dislike hate these dependencies because the reader of the new proof will have trouble understanding the proof completely. It&#x27;s like dropping in some magic in the middle of the proof and saying: &quot;if you want to understand this proof completely, go read this other 50 page article&quot; Sound familiar? Some mathematicians hate this so much they insist on proving things from the ground up whenever possible so that the proof is as comprehensible as possible.

However, despite years of research and many advances in the underlying formalisms of specification, semantics, and logic, formal methods are not much used in practice. In our opinion this is related to three major shortcomings. First, the application of formal methods is still expensive because they are labor- and knowledge-intensive. Second, they are difficult to scale up to complex systems because they are based on deep mathematical insights about the behavior of the systems (i.e., they rely on the “heroic proof”). Third, the proofs can be difficult to interpret, and typically stand in isolation from the original code.<p>The situation will just get worse as we increasingly move away from hand written logic to machine learned logic. Now, there is probably a place for formal methods in this newer order, but it will take awhile for researchers to find it, and it is definitely not going to be at the level of verifying hand-encoded logic that doesn&#x27;t exist.",1439167141

C has an almost non-existent standard library, and C++ has a relatively weak standard library (compare Java or Python). This means that relatively basic concepts like &quot;lists&quot; or &quot;iterators,&quot; which end up being common in GUI code, end up needing to be massaged slightly differently for any library that uses them.<p>2. Invariably, the desire list for GUI libraries starts requiring platform support logic that&#x27;s very, very different for different platforms. File picker dialog? Now you need to handle filesystems. Printer dialog? Goodbye!<p>3. Even where features are more or less identical between different platforms, how they work actually tends to differ at a fine-grained level. Change the font, and all of a sudden text flows differently; what may have fit a fixed-size window no longer fits. When you ask for the union of possible features instead of the intersection, you also make sure that the toolkit has to get into very low-level details of this stuff (e.g., double-buffering, damage rectangles, pixel drawing), where these differences are much more noticeable.<p>4. UI conventions themselves are actually very different across platforms, particularly if you include mobile or tablet form factors in addition to desktops. So a toolkit that wants to be as-native-as-possible would require UI to be designed and specified only at very high levels, to the point where it&#x27;s not a thin layer around the UI toolkit but rather a component that dictates the design of your application.",1439166335

Not gonna argue with anyone there.<p>Though I still think it&#x27;s curious why it&#x27;s easier for me to understand a concept through code than it is through Math. It&#x27;s sort of reminiscent of when you first learned Algebra, your teacher would tell you to replace the variable with an easy number and work through it to understand the mechanics of equations.<p>I think code is an example of that - literally working through the mechanics of algorithms to understand what they actually do and how they work.",1439165044

Different ideas paint a vastly different picture of mathematics and even the universe. For example platonism vs. nominalism. Lets not be so quick to put forward as an obvious truth the critical issue in question.",1439164915

10032013,comment,10031286,10031286,0,0,currentoor,,,"Interesting article. I always thought math felt like programming but in a language far higher level than any of the available programming languages. So like programming but with a lot less friction when going from thought to symbols.<p>For example, creating new domain specific control flows with Lisp macros versus defining a Dirac delta function using limits and integrals. In programming it&#x27;s easy for bugs to seep in because there are more little/subtle details and leaky abstractions. But math on the other hand feels much more abstract and clean.<p>Perhaps this is just because dumb silicon boxes interpret our code and humans interpret our math which gives us a much more sophisticated base language to work with.",1439164856

What about calculus? It&#x27;s an immensely powerful tool that, by harnessing the power of the infinite and the infinitesimal, unlocks a massive body of practical applications in nearly every field of quantitative knowledge. And what about discrete math? Without it there would be no such thing as a computer.

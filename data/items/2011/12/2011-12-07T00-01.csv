Well the goal is to make it easy the development of Node.js application when you work with a lot of asynchronous operations, which turns to be like 90% of the work you do in Node.js. Because Node.js works in a asynchronous way, so you have to write a lot of callbacks to work with the results when they are available, Fire.js uses JSON documents to define the behavior you'd have to write in plain javascript. With fire.js you don't have to write callbacks, just put expression calls in a JSON block one after the other.<p>{ ""@DoThis"": null, ""@ThenDoThat"":null}<p>Under the hood everything will be async.<p>If you want to give it another try, load the video at minute 10:58 and I will try to explain what it does and how it does it :)",1323218981

There are TONS of complaints about this change, and Avos has ignored them all.<p>3. The secure RSS feeds were limited to 10 items. I use these as feeds for common links (news, comics, what have you) and several of my link folders were truncated by the arbitrary limit. They kept trying to fix this, but seemed to be incapable.

As such, it can mean at least two different things.  Two of those things are addressed by DNSCurve and DNSSEC, respectively.  From a functional perspective (i.e. in terms of what they do), they are not in competition with each other.  They each address different things.

This lets a determined minority prevent a measure from being passed even when that measure's support is technically in the majority. Some consider this a feature rather than a bug, as it prevents the minority stance from being completely disenfranchised.<p>This tactic was originally a weapon of last resort, but then its use increased. At some point, a new rule was enacted where discussion could be quashed by 60% (supermajority) vote.

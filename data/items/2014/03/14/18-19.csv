I understand that the current dev kit isn&#x27;t high res, doesn&#x27;t have translational tracking, and generally isn&#x27;t comfortable for long term use. If you hadn&#x27;t stopped reading halfway through the first sentence you would have seen that I said &quot;the Oculus rift or some incarnation of VR&quot;, which was an acknowledgement that the Oculus rift may not be ideal for this when the consumer version is released, but I believe some incarnation of VR will be.<p>Saying it won&#x27;t work because you&#x27;ve tried the hurriedly prepared low res dev kit is like saying smart phones will never take off because your QVGA windows mobile 5 phone is too low res for web browsing. Technology evolves if people find it compelling enough to buy it. Every honest reviewer I have read says the Oculus rift is an amazing experience unlike anything we&#x27;ve ever been able to experience. I have no doubt that the 1080p versions they are demoing now will give way to 4k versions in a few years (if not sooner), and that eventually working in a rift will be as comfortable as can be.<p>Tech is never fixed in stone.",1394823583

It provides a pseudo-anonymous virtual currency, a pseudo-anonymous virtual commodity, a distributed transaction processing system, a distributed ledger system, a distributed analog to mining, and the various interesting uses people have come up using the block chain for things other than those things already listed.<p>For most applications for a virtual currency or virtual commodity, only a subset of those are necessary, and for many applications some of them are undesirable, and for many applications there are additional features that would be good to have.<p>I think the historical role of Bitcoin will be as a proof of concept demonstrating that a whole bunch of feature, some that were thought to be very hard to do in practice, are feasible to design into a system, but that in practice it will be replaced by several different systems each addressing particular classes of application and optimized for those applications.",1394823504

7400950,comment,7398926,7398926,1,0,schrijver,,,"As a designer I have been trying to dig this stuff. Server side JS seems like a huge win for all kinds of small websites and interesting ui experiments, because one can stay in one language and avoid code duplication.<p>Yet in trying to set up some experiments that use a server-side git integration, I bumped into the kind of code described in this thread, and I find it super difficult to understand the async way of doing things.<p>Here’s an example from the homepage of nodegit, which seem to be among the best maintained libraries that wrap libgit2. Thus I imagine it represents idiomatic node.js What the code does, is console.log details of all the repositories commits, git log style.<p><pre><code>  // Load in the module.\n  var git = require(&#x27;nodegit&#x27;),\n    async = require(&#x27;async&#x27;);\n\n  // Open the repository in the current directory.\n  git.repo(&#x27;.git&#x27;, function(error, repository) {\n    if (error) throw error;\n\n    // Use the master branch (a branch is the HEAD commit)\n    repository.branch(&#x27;master&#x27;, function(error, branch) {\n      if (error) throw error;\n\n      // History returns an event, and begins walking the history\n      var history = branch.history();\n\n      // History emits &#x27;commit&#x27; event for each commit in the branch&#x27;s history\n      history.on(&#x27;commit&#x27;, function(error, commit) {\n        // Print out `git log` emulation.\n          async.series([\n              function(callback) {\n                  commit.sha(callback);\n              },\n              function(callback) {\n                  commit.date(callback);\n              },\n              function(callback) {\n                  commit.author(function(error, author) {\n                      author.name(callback);\n                  });\n              },\n              function(callback) {\n                  commit.author(function(error, author) {\n                      author.email(callback);\n                  });\n              },\n              function(callback) {\n                  commit.message(callback);\n              }\n          ], function printCommit(error, results) {\n              if (error) throw error;\n              console.log(&#x27;SHA &#x27; + results[0]);\n              console.log(results[1] * 1000);\n              console.log(results[2] + &#x27; <&#x27; + results[3] + &#x27;>&#x27;);\n              console.log(results[4]);\n          });\n      });\n    });\n  });\n</code></pre>\nIt looks so alien to me! Instead of the tree-walking and looping constructs I know from synchronous languages, we deal with a history that returns events as it walks the tree (btw, why is it that we can launch the history before we attach the event?). Then we have to actually import the ‘async’ module, because, uhm, we want to specify an order by which the different parts of the message gets logged.<p>How then the actual callbacks work, I’d be happy if someone can explain that to me—why do I pass a function to an attribute of the object? Why don‘t I just return the value?<p>Because the code is not written in a lineair way, I have to keep looking back and forth between callbacks to get a mental picture of what it does.<p>For the record, what this translates to as synchronous Python:<p><pre><code>  from pygit2 import Repository, GIT_SORT_TOPOLOGICAL\n  repo = Repository(&#x27;.git&#x27;)\n\n  for commit in repo.walk(repo.head.target, GIT_SORT_TOPOLOGICAL):\n       print &#x27;SHA %s&#x27; % commit.hex\n       print commit.commit_time * 1000\n       print &#x27;%s <%s>&#x27; % (commit.author.name, commit.author.email)\n       print commit.message\n</code></pre>\nI imagine that, as some of the commenters note, I will be able to start reading the async style if I get enough exposure to it. I wonder though, if it does not make the barrier to entry for server-side JavaScript too high for non-full-time programmers.<p>In that sense it is interesting that the Meteor team chose to use the package Fibers, that allows one to write node.js in a procedural style. I imagine something like that is necessary for server side JS to become really mainstream in web design…",1394823069

The one in FF does not use a master password by default, so anyone could look at an unattended computer and see all stored passwords with a few clicks. The article mentions an old JavaScript attack on the passwords as well (but then dismisses the threat, since that one hole was patched).<p>So the problem really is that the browsers pushed insecure features out to the masses, and many people adopted them. The number of people in the general population who use a password manager is low (obviously it is high here on HN). So think of the autocomplete=off flag as a flag to make sure you are using a competent password manager, one that recognizes the problem and then overrides the flag.

They include nationalistic groups, but even the most marginal do not dare show anti-Semitism or other xenophobic behavior.

Not only was the country involved in another war, but the nation&#x27;s schools were unable to elicit the achievement from learners it anticipated. Grant Venn argued that since only 19% of first graders complete a bachelor or arts degree, that the current educational system is only serving the advantaged minority of schoolchildren. To counter this trend Robert Morgan proposed to conduct an experiment with an &quot;organic curriculum&quot; which would to incorporate into the educational system the best instructional practices identified through research. Accepted in 1967 the proposal by the US Office of Education, the project was dubbed &quot;Educational Systems for the 1970&#x27;s&quot;, or ES&#x27;70. Morgan engaged an array of experts in the field of learning, cognition, and instructional design to contribute to the project and carried out multiple experiments in a variety of settings. Of these was Leslie Briggs, who had demonstrated that an instructionally designed course could yield up to 2:1 increase over conventionally designed courses in terms of achievement, reduction in variance, and reduction of time-to-completion – this effect was four times that of the control group which received no training. In 1970, Morgan partnered with the Florida Research and Development Advisory Board to conduct a nation-wide educational reform project in South Korea. Faced with the task of increasing the achievement of learners while at the same time reducing the cost of schooling from $41.27 per student per year Morgan applied some of the same techniques as had been piloted in the ES&#x27;70 project and achieved striking results: an increase in student achievement, a more efficient organization of instructors and course content, an increased teacher to student ratio, a reduction in salary cost, and a reduction in yearly per student cost by $9.80.&quot; (<a href=""http://edutech-05.blogspot.com/2008/03/brief-history-of-instructional-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edutech-05.blogspot.com/2008/03/brief-history-of-inst...</a>)<p>As a result, many countries continue to send students to Florida State&#x27;s Instructional Systems Design program.<p>It&#x27;s sad that our bureaucracy prevents us from benefiting from our own research.",1394821924

I&#x27;ve had abundant experiences with both event-based models (which hardly started with Node!) in several paradigms (GUI, server, network) and models like Erlang, Go, and Haskell. It is no contest. The latter is sane. The former is not. If you have the opportunity to choose freely, and you choose the event-based model, you have chosen poorly.&quot;<p>Nonsense. First, if you read what I said, I explicitly stated that this IS NOT new and has been around forever in many different forms, even citing some of the same domains you did ( GUI ).<p>Second, everything you state here can be summed up with &quot;I don&#x27;t like it.&quot; Your preference for the models in Erlang, Go and Haskell are opinions, nothing more. I agree with you that there are some interesting approaches to different event-systems, across many different styles and languages, but there is nothing inherently superior to one over the other, beyond &quot;taste&quot;.<p>&quot;Believe me, it is not the critics of Node who are the inexperienced ones. All the evidence I&#x27;ve seen points strongly in the opposite direction. Node advocates could start by getting their understanding of how their competition works out of the mid-1990s.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t believe you, because I&#x27;ve been programming since the late 80s/early 90s, and I think Node is a fine choice for building certain types of software.

The signs are all there, the parallel evolution is clear, and apparently the process has already begun with Meteor. I wonder if the community will ever acknowledge how crazy they&#x27;ve been as they careen from one &quot;solution&quot; to the next at breakneck speed, all the while crowing about how much better their stuff is, even though what they consider &quot;their stuff&quot; can&#x27;t seem to stay stable for 3 months?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know where this &#x27;community&#x27; is, but frankly, most communities have advocates that talk too loud about things and make ridiculous claims about things.

These things have nothing to do with actually writing code and creating good/usable software. I submit that you should ignore these people and focus on working with tools that help you write software.<p>If Node does not help enhance your ability to create software, it&#x27;s not the tool for you.

Users should try apps that support their privacy and spread the word about them. No mention of what the apps actually are.<p>The site itself, as others said, tracks users through Google Analytics.

Encourage and fund this project, so that most people can press a button and get a Tor-enabled browser immediately.<p>4. Or, get developers to set up more Tor nodes and bridges.<p>5. Or, get developers to finally bring IPv6 to Tor.<p>6. Or, get developers to create alternatives to specific popular services that are currently monitored by the NSA.

The whole Amiga system is structured around using the CPU to program the custom chips and initiate DMA transfers, and installing interrupt handlers that perform the next phase of the program once the custom chips finished their work. It&#x27;s <i>how shit got done</i> on the Amiga. By contrast, the lack of good support in early Unix for asynchronous I/O is said to be one of the reasons why X11 is such an ugly pile of hacks.<p>Even on Unix, if you wrote a server procedurally what you&#x27;d end up doing is having main() start a select loop that... dispatches incoming events to callbacks. All Node does really is to abstract away the select loop -- one less thing for the developer to worry about. The Node way is <i>simpler</i> than the conventional C way.<p>So no, there&#x27;s nothing inherently superior about linear, procedural code, especially when such code is not at all how a computer system that must interact with the outside world works.

But many survived.<p>So this strategy works perfectly well if you have the ear of the Federal Reserve or another entity that can provide very large amounts of money.

The best engineers I&#x27;ve worked with did not have CS or CE degrees and neither do I. Some of them had nothing but a high school diploma or GED. Formal training is certainly not needed, and in many cases, it&#x27;s a hamper. Also, the money wasted on such is much better spent elsewhere, especially considering the curriculum and many colleges/universities, one that is hardly up to date and does not prepare students for real world development.",1394820112

Since in practice, except during a run, only a fraction of a bank&#x27;s liabilities are called in at any given time, it is safe to keep less cash on hand than the entire amount that <i>could</i> be withdrawn instantly.<p>The rest is converted to assets with equivalent value that have worse than instant liquidity, but a higher return on investment.  This keeps the balance sheet honest with respect to the total value of assets and liabilities, but technically, the bank cannot honor all of its commitments in the worst case scenario.  That&#x27;s fractional reserve.<p>Mt. Gox does not even have the imaginary, illiquid assets to balance out its depositor liabilities.

7400627,comment,7398926,7398926,2,0,angersock,,,"So, here&#x27;s how I think about it:<p>Any program, of any type, has a synchronous story to it: data came in, then this happened to it, then this happened to it, then it left. If you follow the program execution, this is how it works.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to reason about, right? And it&#x27;s very easy to program this way.<p>One of the biggest breakthroughs in computer engineering was the idea of multiple concurrent processes (and nevermind that behind the scenes they were still running on a single processor!), and then later still true concurrent multi-processor architectures.<p>We developed operating systems and compilers and runtimes <i>specifically</i> to let us take advantage of that without the having to break from easy-to-reason-about synchronous code.<p>~<p>Node said, hell with it, everything is async all the time. This is really annoying at first, because there are many many times where sync is the best way to reason about something.<p>That said, there is some beauty in such a hard-line approach: if you are truly async, handling an error is the same as handling a task which takes too long. Once you&#x27;ve paid that price properly, you&#x27;re fine. (This is also what makes Erlang kind of cool.)<p>The big frustration is that there really ought to be a way of writing synchronous-looking Javascript code (ES5) which--behind the scenes!--is multiplexed and made to run concurrently and without blocking. The mechanisms are all there for programmers to deal with exceptional failures (exceptions, anyone?), and so are synchronization points (functions having multiple arguments should probably join on the evaluation of those arguments before being invoked--that&#x27;s something the interpreter should be doing already).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is...why don&#x27;t JS interpreters do lazy evaluation and late binding?",1394820091

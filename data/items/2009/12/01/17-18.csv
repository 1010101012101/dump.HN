It's the same in any human endeavor, whether we're talking phds or plumbers.<p>Any time people start throwing around the words ""science"" and ""scientists"" a lot I get increasingly skeptical.

970225,comment,969646,970009,0,0,squarecog,,,"In addition to the criticisms you address in your addendum (women's perspective is important, and ""works or not"" is too simplistic) consider this: by creating and perpetuating environment that is unfriendly to women, we are reducing the talent pool from which we draw programmers by sightly more than 50%. Even if there was no such thing as ""a woman's perspective"" (depends on the woman/man in question, I suppose), it is highly inefficient to limit your pool this way. In my opinion this is NOT, in fact, self-selection, not to the degree this imbalance is getting to. I've seen multiple times in the universities I've attended the difference between how things get explained to women and men -- many instructors and TAs, for example, will quickly and subconsciously drop into condescension and use things like cooking analogies when talking to female students. I've heard programmers of all talent levels apply gender-based value judgments to women attempting to enter the field. The worst are ""women are bad at logic"" -- and there are many who really believe that -- but ""you are a woman so you will do the UI as you must be good at visual stuff"" is also sexist.",1259690269

If it doesn't have that, why wouldn't I use an existing language?<p>If it were entering a vacuum, sure, great, no problem, but it's not.<p>I guess this goes back to my old standard for examining the usefulness of a language: ""What problem does it solve?"" There ought to be a single sentence that says what problem the language solves. Python: ""It's too hard to program; we need to make it easier."" Perl: ""Too many separate UNIX tools, we should merge them together."" Haskell: ""Our academic theory is great and all, but we need to come out of our ivory towers and prove it works.<p>Javascript on the server: ""...""? ""I really want to be able to use the same language on the server as the client"" is a I think what it's going for, and as far as that goes it's ok, but my objection is that it isn't a very good server language. And note my objections really are about the <i>language</i>, not merely a lack of libraries, which is completely solvable. You can't just graft on concurrency anymore, at least not as far as I'm concerned; my standards have risen.",1259690039

The Navy's surgery program in San Diego is actually on probation for being over on work hours and under on patients.

Immediately they label these people as ""deniers"" / ""skeptics"" or even paranoid.

That’s partly because it’s easy for everyone to get caught up in “informational cascades”, and partly because there are so many psychic and financial rewards rewards for working on a problem that seems to be a crisis. We all like to think that our work is vitally useful in solving a major social problem — and the more major the problem seems, the more money society is liable to spend on it.<p>""I’m not trying to suggest that climate change isn’t a real threat, or that scientists are deliberately hyping it. But when they look at evidence of the threat, they may be subject to the confirmation bias — seeing trends that accord with their preconceptions and desires. Given the huge stakes in this debate — the trillions of dollars that might be spent to reduce greenhouse emissions — it’s important to keep taking skeptical looks at the data.

(Also, typo: ""good dead"" => ""good deed"".)<p>If I were you, I'd be thinking a lot about how to take advantage of game dynamics. If Foursquare can do that about going places, surely you can do it about finding great deals, which is inherently competitive to begin with. I'm not fond of shopping, but even I will boast about great deals when I find them. If you can get that right... wow.<p>How do you prevent people from posting fake deals? Is there a way for others to validate? Would it be useful for people to post not just new deals, but confirmation of deals they benefited from? That would have two advantages: 1. you'd get people participating both ways; 2. you'd get validating information about what the really good deals are. If I post something lots of people benefit from, that should earn me status.<p>You need to have a blog. Tell stories. True stories about deals users have found would be good. Also, a personal touch can be a big deal: consider taking the ""Team"" thing off the bottom of the About page and put it in its own place where you introduce yourselves. As a user, if I feel a personal connection to the people behind a site, I'm automatically more sympathetic.<p>The Community page doesn't draw me in. It looks like a database report right now. That page is a chance to get people to participate, so you want it to be warm and inviting. Also, it's hard to react positively to something one doesn't understand, so getting the key information across in the first 10 seconds is critical.<p>Don't bother putting up messages like ""nothing in your location, redirecting to New York"". It's obvious that you're redirecting me to NYC anyway, and a message box just irritates the pig. (Maybe put this information in some text on the actual page?) Also, when I load the page in FF I'm getting a status box overlay that says ""Detecting your location"" that takes a long time to go away and blocks my use of the site (plus is ugly). Drop that. You don't want <i>any</i> barrier to entry at that moment. People can bail on you in less than a second.<p>If I were you I would pay super-close attention to the psychology of how people are using the site. If you find a dynamic that works, this could be killer. It's not obvious that appealing to people's altruism (""good deed"", ""karma"", etc.) is the right approach. Competitive shopping can be vicious! Think about that question, ""What's your deadly sin?"" It may not be so much greed (saving money) as vanity (winning status).<p>I'm afraid I don't like the name. First, it reminds me of Cinnabon. Second, American names with French roots are good for a fancy, specialty vibe (e.g. gourmet, luxury), or conveying effete sophistication, but that may not be what you want.<p>Summary: you guys could be on to something.

If you really must use a 1.8 series, don't use the weird-o transitional one that no one uses.

And by forward-looking and realistic, I just mean ignorant.<p>Here's how I knew that global warming was happening and caused by man: a friend told me the top scientists agreed it was true.<p>I will actually accept a lot of information based on scientific consensus. However, recently, I learned eminent scientists are lying to me (and their colleagues), so my whole basis for belief fell apart. Also, I started looking at some of the data and discussion, and there are plenty of reasons to doubt - sane, statistical reasons... not like 9-11 is an inside job type conjecture.<p>I am an Obama-loving, liberal, pro-recycling, bike-owner, but I am no longer convinced that climate change is human-created, and I'm not satisfied that carbon abatement is the one true path to salvation. I actually do tend to believe these things are likelier true than not, but I am no longer one of the faithful.<p>When top scientists start lying to us, ""cleaning up"" data, and warning of the apocryphal end of man, I start to wonder if these scientists aren't just the witch doctors of another era, with different vestments and potions. But then I think, nah... the WSJ is right. They aren't superstitious, they are just human, corrupt, and greedy.",1259686987

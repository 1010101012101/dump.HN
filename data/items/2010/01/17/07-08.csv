1058185,comment,1057840,1058152,0,0,chrischen,,,"> As soon as people's daily lives get good enough for them to have some free time for watching TV or owning a yacht, they stop caring about what the government is doing.<p>Free time has different effects on different people. Perhaps that's what your personal experience has led you to believe, but for me, and quite many others in the developed world, free time has freed us from constant thoughts about satisfying our basic needs, and allows us to contemplate higher levels of needs like ""political correctness,"" ""ethics and equality,"" ""freedom of speech,"" and ""technology startups.""<p>It's probably also why the super-elite are the liberal do-gooders and political leaders. They don't have to worry about finding a job and ""making it"" or scavenging for food or shelter. Of course there are some with too much free time but explore it in other ways. Hippies, socialites, druggies, and startup founders I think are also examples of what happens when we satisfy basic needs and seek a higher meaning to life. It also depends on your intellectual level. But the point is that free time allows the upper-echelons of society to dwell on issues like freedom of speech, not necessarily all people though.<p>So in China there will be some people who are comfortable enough and start seeking more out of life. But for my relatives and pretty much all the current older generation they don't care. The younger people will probably start caring, but the older ones are just glad it's not like it was when they were children anymore. They probably just want the burden to be passed to their children... and so it will. But until my generation starts taking over completely, most of China's backwards policies will be mostly ignored by the people. Who knows, China's policies might even be superior and they might just keep it up.<p>I'm kind of scared of the implications to be honest. What if China, which has over a billion in population, creates a government sponsored organization that starts operating in an unregulated free market. Wouldn't it have an advantage in that economy over a multitude of separately competing entities? (sorry for slightly changing the topic. I always wanted to ask this)",1263713213

He can break up with Alice, tell the world that Alice is evil, and be perpetually horribly hurt. Or he can take what he learned and manipulate Alice.

The entire rest of the world should stop doing business with them. Why make it the responsibility of corporate company to make moral judgement on governments. Yahoo complied with a legal subpoena in China. That was a reasonable thing to do.<p>You should think about the legal requests that Yahoo, Google and every other company routinely comply with in America in the context of the Guantanamo bay facility and the PATRIOT act. Are those companies doing the world a service?<p>I know it easy, and apparently trendy, to throw stones at Yahoo over this but frankly that's a very simplistic and naive attitude.<p>I've met both the Yahoo founders and spent a fair amount of time with one of them. They are nice guys, they have done some awesome things for ""human rights"" while I've been at Yahoo, like their anti-Prop 8 contributions.<p>I'm not saying that every decision that a large corporation makes is good for society, fair, or even moral. But, I do think it's ridiculous to make companies moral arbiters when dealing off-shore.<p>And frankly, part of the point of my original post is everyone's hypocrisy. I would bet a $100 that everyone, without exception that has commented on this thread has at one time or another bought something from China (or elsewhere in the 3rd world) that was made by people treated inhumanely.<p>So even though you threw the first stone, I hope you think about if you can justify it.<p>My own opinions, not necessarily Yahoo!s position, etc, etc",1263712131

However, every week there's a new story about these scientists employing suspicious science to arrive at more profitable [1] conclusions.  I don't know that victory hooting is necessary here, but a certain amount of ""WTF?""ing is definitely called for.  Whether or not global warming is a real and man-made phenomenon (vs. a natural cycle or just overinflated numbers), it's important to call attention to the fact that someone is more or less pissing on our leg and telling us it's raining.<p>I maintain though, as I always have, that the reduction of carbon dioxide waste is a POSITIVE aim as is anything seeking to minimize the effect of ourselves on our environment.  The only things I'm calling into question are the tactics currently being employed.  If this data-munging is a universal thing, I'd argue that the ends do not warrant the means.  This should be a scientific debate, not an emotional one (as it has become).<p>[1] I say profitable because it's hard for contrarians to get grant money as they are generally believed to be 'quacks'.",1263712112

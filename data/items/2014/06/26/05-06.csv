Maybe it&#x27;s because when I am solving the capture, I just look at one letter at a time, instead of trying to read and comprehend the word. I found it that in many cases the control word isn&#x27;t actually a word at all, just string of characters.

I had the idea that you could make a 10,000 x 10,000 pixel virtual screen and then use it for programming. You could turn your head and phone would then show a different part of the screen. Also I had it so if you tilted your head left or right it would zoom in or out based on the direction.<p>It worked well enough, but my phone&#x27;s resolution was only 1280x800 which is 640x800 per eye.

Actors don&#x27;t just play around on stage and quote Shakespeare all the time. More broadly, actors must:<p><pre><code>    * Learn vast amounts of material in a short period of time\n    * Work independently\n    * Work as a team\n    * Accept criticism\n    * Show up on time\n    * Meet deadlines (the show must go on)\n    * Adhere to a strict schedule\n    * Speak comfortably in public\n    * Have good communication skills\n    * Basic improvisational skills\n    * Empathy\n </code></pre>\nHow many of those do you think would be useful in a tech job? (Hint: all of them)<p>Take what you know. Broaden the scope. Mix in some code and a basic portfolio. Get a junior position somewhere.

They don&#x27;t use, Detroit for example, when computing the cost of suburban housing.<p>Here is an example, I don&#x27;t know if will work for you. Marysville Washington, a quiet little town, the paper has a 2004 edition online [1] and on page 21 of 26 are the rental listings. 2 Bedroom, 1.5 bath apartments are about $500. If you look at &#x27;forrent&#x27;[2] a rental search service for Marysville, two bedroom 1.5 bath apartments today are closer to $1,000 a month. It may not be exactly 100% and its hard to pin it to an exact unit (would be interesting if you found the same unit in a newspaper and online) but not taking the Fed&#x27;s word for it, and <i>actually looking at papers that were published back then</i> which is key in my opinion, shows a much higher increase in costs than the Fed reports as having occurred. That is why I wonder how they compute their indexes (but the last time I dug into it they claimed secrecy so that people wouldn&#x27;t try to &#x27;game&#x27; them.)<p>Not trying to argue, just getting a different result when I go to the primary sources.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ovGv7akYl-cC&dat=20040107&printsec=frontpage&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ovGv7akYl-cC&dat=20040...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forrent.com/results.php?page_type_id=refine&search_type=citystate&view_type=List&is_refined=1&is_sort_default=1&seed=1509210882&main_field=Marysville%2C+WA&ssradius=-1&sbeds=2&sbaths=1.5&borough=-1&neighborhood=-1&min_price=%240&max_price=No+Limit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forrent.com/results.php?page_type_id=refine&searc...</a>",1403761562

The other mod made missiles follow slightly wider turning arcs, so they were harder to dodge by going around corners.  It seems like a tiny difference, but high-level competitive players want their missiles exactly right because different missile tracking leads to different viable tactics.  &quot;That shot into that tunnel is a sure kill&quot; turns into &quot;that shot is unlikely to hit&quot;; &quot;I can dodge that&quot; turns into &quot;I have no option but to run&quot;.  The primary developer of the other mod was not a high-level competitive player and did not see this as a problem.  Merely suggesting the fix (which my wife originally coded as a patch to the other mod), with simulations, a mathematical proof of correctness, and uniformly positive feedback from many top-level pilots, was enough to touch off a flamewar that wasn&#x27;t settled for weeks.<p>People can be <i>fanatical</i> about their video games.<p>[0] the game is Descent (1 and 2).

7948260,comment,7947563,7947563,2,0,prateek_mir,,,"There are two sides to this entire Black Money story.<p>First is the bitter reality of the parallel economy that runs in India, amounting to huge revenue losses to the governments each year. The black money, not only robs to country and its citizens of their revenues, but also can then be used into funding terror activities, because this amount may very well be transferred via Hawala Channels ( they won&#x27;t wire black money to tax havens, would they ? ). This is the money that can be used by the government to increase the services, this is the money that was intended to be transferred to the citizens in the form of increased infrastructure and better services. Ultimately citizens end up paying hefty amount of money for really crappy services.<p>the author is right in suggesting that this stash, if it even existed in no longer lying in the swiss banks, and has been rerouted to other investment opportunities, and possibly rerouted to Indian markets itself, via different channels (like the controversial participatory notes, shell companies etc). Both the current and the previous government have provided enough room for managing the black money, and I&#x27;ll be surprised if India is successful in extracting any significant amount of money (order of 10 Mil. $), or to extract only account closure reports for the Indians who held account in various swiss banks and banks at other tax havens like Liechtenstein.<p>The other side of story is that it has become an issue that attracts eye balls. The amount that is suggested to be at stake is huge enough to attract the attention of even the upper middle class. People are very much dissatisfied with the performances of subsequent governments, and that made the <i>Black Money Issue</i> something on which political campaigns can be built upon. This issue was advertised in such a way that would attract the attention of average person, who wouldn&#x27;t go into the details of the issue, by using headlines like, &quot;We won&#x27;t have to pay any taxes for a decade&quot;, &quot;Every citizen would be given X sum of money&quot;, &quot;India&#x27;s revenue deficit would be bridged&quot; etc.<p>As the events and outcomes of this election suggests, it worked. The current government even managed to show the act of constituting the Special Investigation Team to look into this matter, as a voluntary act of being righteous, when in reality they were just following the Supreme Court&#x27;s directive to do so within a week.<p>Curious days ahead.",1403761128

I would pay up to $50 a year for the pleasure of being able to get domain validated SSL certs that are trusted by the major browsers. I would assume that the validation would be via emailing webmaster@domain and making them either respond or click a link or something. That could all be automated couldn&#x27;t it.<p>Also, make wildcard certificates for domains available for the same low price, because it shouldn&#x27;t take any more work should it. If I control example.org, then I think it&#x27;s obvious that I control www.example.org and slighly-biased.example.org.<p>But then you have the issue of, if Org A controls com.au, that doesn&#x27;t mean they control mywebsite.com.au. I don&#x27;t know how you would automate that issue.<p>The non-automated stuff, make people pay for it. Seriously.",1403759805

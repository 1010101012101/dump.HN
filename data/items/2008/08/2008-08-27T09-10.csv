Someone who's started 5 successful companies probably <i>does</i> have some insight into the legal part of it, even though he's not a lawyer.",1219831171
287889,comment,287851,287851,0,0,maxklein,,,"Sometimes one just needs to know in general how the law looks like, and cannot be bothered to ask a lawyer. For example, let's say you want to know if it's legal to sleep with a 17 year old girl. You ask your friend who has experience with such things. You don't go calling up a lawyer straight away.. it makes you look suspicious.",1219831111

I've been surprised by how pleasant most of them are, given the reputation the industry has.  I have met a couple of obnoxiously ""fratty"" VCs, but they weren't partners, and they weren't with a top tier firm.",1219830690

287883,comment,287851,287851,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Excellent advice.<p>The law is not logical and the outcomes are not reasonable. This is a hard thing for the engineering mind to come to terms with given how much these seemingly random outcomes can affect peoples' lives.<p>The law is a system that's nearly completely hacked at this point. Think of it as a RedHat linux 5.0 system with wuftp enabled that's been running on the net since '97. Do you really think that <i>ls</i> is still <i>ls</i>?",1219828761

My hope was that by assuming virtually nobody ran the race 10 years ago, which I assume/hope is totally inaccurate, the two errors would cancel each other out.<p>It's a 'back-of-a-napkin' calculation.  Certainly not accurate but a nice place to start for future refactoring.",1219827626

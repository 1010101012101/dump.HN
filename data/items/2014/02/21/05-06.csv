7275650,comment,7274819,7275562,3,0,lovemenot,,,"I work with some Nestle folks in Japan. One of them told me that they have 200 kitkat varieties nationwide. The idea is to align to local taste and pride in the &quot;meibutsu&quot; of each region. (e.g. pickled plum in Nagasaki). Nobody else does this, to my knowledge. The kit-kats are imported though as there is no local production.\nThis marketing has been successful. KitKat is the #1 chocolate bar in Japan. Anecdotally, I was told that many consumers believe Nestle is a Japanese company.",1392962322

The thing that steamrollered HyperCard was Visual BASIC, which could talk to all kinds of system services, and once it had COM support, could talk to just about anything on the planet.

7275634,comment,7274819,7275373,6,0,regal,,,"Your argument is that because I don&#x27;t realize that some other brand of chocolate is superior to Hershey&#x27;s chocolate, I&#x27;m not a supertaster?<p>Please read the Wikipedia article, or any research on, what a supertaster is. It is not a &quot;person with more distinguished tastes&quot;, since these are wholly subjective and cultural constructs. Just as you believe in your own superiority for preferring Swiss chocolate over American chocolate (might you have refined taste in wine as well? [1]), a Chinese citizen no doubt realizes how superior his tastes are to yours for preferring his largely sugar-free chocolate to your (in his eyes) sickeningly sweet, additive-laden, and clearly unrefined dessert of choice.<p>And if your argument is that Hershey must certainly be producing what it produces in order to &quot;take advantage of lax standards&quot;, you&#x27;ve much to learn about the nature of big business. Visit Asia some time, and you&#x27;ll notice quite quickly how American chain Pizza Hut, which has adapted to the tastes of the locals by changing its recipes and producing all manner of pizzas largely unappealing to Americans but very appealing to Asians, is rapidly outcompeting other American chain Papa John&#x27;s, which has stuck with its original American recipe, remaining tasty to Americans... but not so tasty to most Asians. Branded food businesses win by serving the market, not by cranking out crappy tasting morsels that cost less to produce. Those that go the latter route fail in their respective markets.<p>If Hershey is producing what it&#x27;s producing to &quot;take advantage of lax standards&quot; and not because it&#x27;s what the market wants, then the American chocolate industry is wide open for someone more willing to produce in line with what Americans want - and with a market as large as the dessert market in a nation of obese individuals, that&#x27;d be a pretty tempting niche to fill (maybe Nestle could do the job?). Yet, unless you can point to tremendously high barriers to entry keeping new entrants from the market, or somehow forcing Americans to buy Hershey instead of some of Dove, Nestle, Ferrero Rocher, etc., your premise seems flawed; the far simpler solution is simply that Hershey is winning the chocolate race in America not because it&#x27;s skirting the rules, but because it&#x27;s producing what its (so obviously unrefined) customers all want.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tas...</a>",1392961638

7275624,comment,7275548,7275548,64,0,jacobolus,,,"I think this blog post is overly caught up on the word “card” – HyperCard “cards” weren’t particularly like the cards inside android or twitter or facebook. Indeed, if HyperCard cards were like anything, it’s web pages, except designed for the limitations of the hardware of the time and targeting only one hardware platform (standard display, etc.) and running on a single non-networked computer.<p>Also, why “way too early”? Too early for what?<p>The most important feature of HyperCard, in my opinion, was that it gave end-users powerful general-purpose tools for programming and solving their own problems, in a way that was easy to get started with. Instead of being locked into someone’s existing program designed with an idealized customer’s needs, any HyperCard user could create or customize a HyperCard stack to suit their own preferences.<p>Unfortunately, tools requiring customer learning and mastery are very difficult to design and implement, and even more difficult to demo and sell. And so our software is designed in a very narrow and limiting fashion. The “cards” in android and facebook and twitter &c. are doing nothing to combat this, and to compare them favorably to HyperCard is in my opinion to completely (and tragically) miss the point of HyperCard.<p>I don’t see any particular signs of this trend toward closed systems reversing; indeed, as more people come online, and giant corporations spend billions of dollars hiring all the smartest people to work on developing software that gives them (the corporations) as much control as possible over uses of computer hardware/software, the popular machines and software systems are only getting more closed and locked down. The web itself is an open and flexible platform, but increasingly people are spending their time in a few centralized and controlled parts of it.",1392961233

I&#x27;ve got a small home business making an electronic widget, plus my day job is at a company that uses fairly elaborate PCBA&#x27;s within industrial products.<p>I can give the perspective of an extremely small shop. I lay out my printed circuit design, order the boards from a fab, buy all of the parts myself, assemble, test, ship. I&#x27;m extremely lucky to have a good understanding of every step, so that when I&#x27;m entering my PCB design, I&#x27;m thinking ahead about everything from soldering to the mechanical integrity of the board in its enclosure. That&#x27;s a lot of experience that we don&#x27;t all possess, plus I deliberately limit myself to technologies that are within my wheelhouse, e.g., manual soldering. Fine pitch digital, or ball grid arrays, would force me to grow up and start paying for assembly, whereupon...<p>Getting boards made in moderate volume: Death by a thousand cuts describes it nicely. In my view the thousand cuts fall into two categories: First, the minor or major omissions and shortages that cause delays, force you to eat a bunch of scrap, or spending nights and weekends re-working boards by hand to meet your launch date. Imagine programming, but with a &quot;compiler&quot; that takes 12 weeks and you pay for every byte of code that you receive. Second, the number of board houses -- both domestic and overseas -- that will bid on jobs without sufficient skill, capacity, etc. Oh, the stories. Remember &quot;for lack of a nail, a shoe was lost...&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what I see at my day job.

You now have to constrain it by another set of rules whose relationship to what&#x27;s actually happening can be unclear and arbitrary.<p>Some products work without storing any data. Most don&#x27;t.

7275566,comment,7274819,7274819,44,0,tjpd,,,"The differences in the taste of chocolate between the US and Europe/the rest of the world all stem back to the late 1800&#x27;s & early 1900&#x27;s.  This is when the great modern confectioners got their start as (mostly puritanical) family firms.  Daniel Peter invented solid milk chocolate in 1875 in Switzerland.  John Cadbury followed suit in England with his first milk chocolate bar in 1897.  Milton S. Hershey in the US built his first chocolate manufacturing plant in 1903.  Franklin Clarence Mars founded Mars in Washington in 1911 only to fail & restart in Minnesota in 1920.<p>Prior to David Peter&#x27;s invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 chocolate was known as a drink.  One of the challenges of making the, now familiar, milk chocolate bar was reducing the water content of the milk to make it easier to emulsify and set the chocolate.  This had to be done in a way that kept the creaminess and didn&#x27;t burn or scorch the milk and that wouldn&#x27;t spoil.  The Swiss got there first it.  Cadbury figured it out (or just copied the Swiss).  Hershey struggled.  He had a chocolate manufacturing plant that was closely guarded not to avoid someone stealing his chocolate recipe but to avoid anyone discovering he didn&#x27;t have one.<p>One day in 1904 he cracked it & depending on who you believe, either by perseverance or by parsimony. Hershey&#x27;s advocates will tell you that late one night, after many failed attempts he & his colleague John Shmalbach discovered just the right slow evaporation of non-fat milk that produced a creamy, faintly bitter chocolate.  Hershey&#x27;s detractors will tell you how a tight-fisted Milton Hershey did not want to waste a large delivery of milk powder that had soured and instead used it & found it sold surprisingly well.   Either way that&#x27;s when Hershey&#x27;s distinctive &quot;sour&quot; flavour was introduced.<p>Then the Great War happened.  Supply problems & rationing hugely restricted Cadbury & the other European manufacturers.  Hershey, despite producing what many thought was a worse product had fewer supply issues and, without European competitors, a US market largely to himself.  By the time Europe has finally picked itself up after the Second World War the American palate and taste for chocolate has long since been fixed.<p>TLDR: Americans have terrible chocolate because in 1914 a Moravian took a wrong turn and got an Austrian shot by a Bosnian<p>p.s.

That's not what the law in this case says at all.</i><p>That is exactly what the law says in this case. The government has declared that MAC randomization is the creation of fraudulent identities for the purposes of authentication, not unlike creating fraudulent photo identification.<p>You can say that randomizing a MAC address is not a crime, just as one can say that creating a fake passport for a movie is not a crime. The crime is in using that fake identification for authentication, which is obvious when customs asks for your passport, but undetectable when a network is using MAC addresses to enforce policy. If subverting that network policy is a felony, then MAC randomization is, by law, sometimes an involuntary felony.<p>While MAC addresses are obviously not a form of identification to technical folks, this stance would not be unprecedented as the US has also made it a felony to forge another trivially forged pseudo identify, Caller ID[1]. Enforcement of CNID spoofing is much easier given the nature of the phone system, since only a few providers bridge from VoIP to POTS.<p>[ 1 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID_spoofing#Legislation_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID_spoofing#Legislation...</a> ]",1358354836

Basically, it encompasses the idea that you can give people permission to trespass, either explicitly or implicitly. If I invite you to my house for dinner, I'm giving you implicit permission to trespass.<p>What you're getting at is the scope of implied license and how it can be revoked. Here is a pretty good, non-legal take on it: <a href=""http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/how-private-is-your-property-20100602-wvym.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/how-privat...</a><p>Basically, the implied license has a scope defined by the rationale for the implication. If you invite a plumber to fix your toilet, they don't have license to use your jacuzzi (though a dinner guest might!) A license can be revoked in any manner that reasonably conveys the revocation to the licensee.<p>The law of property isn't directly applicable to computer networks, but is a source of guiding principles and analogy. If you're on an open network and the administrator bans your MAC address, I think a normal person would conclude that the message that you are no longer welcome has been reasonably conveyed. Moreover, MIT Net does have terms of use, and one of those terms (#4 of 6) is: ""Don't misuse the intellectual property of others."" You can also argue that these terms of use define the scope of the implied license to use MIT's open network.",1358354735

5067553,comment,5060235,5063774,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"I believe non-violent civil disobedience is an ethical imperative in the face of unjust law. I've participated in non-violent civil disobedience on a number of occasions, and hope I will have the courage to do so again in the future.<p>Civil disobedience is not the only, or often even the best, way to change oppressive laws...but, it has been a necessary component of most major cultural shifts. Civil rights, LGBTQ equality, etc. They all happened because a few people were brave enough to break the law, even in cases where the law was popular. However, it is very much worth pointing out that most prosecutors, when pursuing charges against participants in non-violent civil disobedience exercise restraint. They rarely pursue felony charges (though this has been changing; activists in Texas are alarmed by the new use of bizarre old laws to charge participants in the Tarsands Blockade with felonies; but this is the exception rather than the rule), and it is usually possible to continue your life without major impediment, perhaps after a short stint (a few days or weeks) in jail, and without the weight of a felony conviction following them around for life. A political act with no profit motive should be treated very differently by prosecutors, and judges, and the law, than an act committed for personal gain.<p>So, I disagree with your assessment that breaking the law is not a valid part of changing the law. Often, it is the <i>only</i> way change happens, and I have great admiration for the people willing to lay their own well-being on the line for something they believe in. In this case, an unjust law was broken, and I consider that an ethically sound decision.<p>Aaron Swartz was known to be a suicide risk. Prosecutors responded to this knowledge with, ""We'll lock him up."" Evil rarely looks like a James Bond villain...it's usually somebody just following orders. Evil was committed in this case, and it's part of a systemic problem in our culture and in our state. ""Well, he broke the law!"" is no justification for hounding a kid into bankruptcy and deep depression. It simply isn't. There is no justification for the behavior of the prosecutors in this case, and there is no justification for the way the law treats non-violent offenders in politicized cases like this.<p>Had Aaron hurt someone with his actions, I would have little sympathy. But, he didn't; he sought only to help people, to free the poorest people from an oppressive lack of access to information. When someone spends their entire life trying to help those least able to defend themselves, and the state responds with threats of decades in prison, the state is committing a great evil. I'm not even going to discuss the distraction of a six month sentence in a plea deal; this case damned near bankrupted him and that was used to back him into a corner where he had no options, and that's deeply unjust.<p>The requirement to be a part of this community is to respectfully discuss topics. Your approach has been to insult the intelligence, objectivity, and knowledge of anyone you engage with. In a community like this, which contains some extremely bright (famously so, in many cases) and curious people, dismissing anyone who disagrees with you as not being objective, or being too emotional, or being biased, while staking out your own claim of being unfailingly objective, unemotional, and unbiased, is insulting. Shutting down conversations by way of insult is unproductive, and unwelcome here.<p>Many people here disagree with you; if you can't convince them by way of reason, you're going to have to deal with being in the minority. To suggest that disagreement with you is uninformed or unobjective, on issues that many of us have taken very seriously for decades (and have seen the force of the state used to oppress friends or acquaintances on a number of occasions in similarly unjust fashion), is not productive.",1358354494

That's what we're referring to when we use the plural for social accounts. We've thought about letting people sign in with Twitter as well.<p>Home within the context of the service is your profile - which you can get to by clicking our logo or by clicking ""My Profile"".

No. ""Hate Group"" is a label used by the private NGO sector -- in this case the ADL and SPLC (two non-governmental organizations) maintain lists of hate groups.<p>Nor does one ""incorporate"" via the federal government. You incorporate in a state. Stripping Westboro of their tax exempt status should be the lead ask there, and yet those petitions are far less popular than the original? Why? Because it's a more severe ask.<p>Same with ""recount the election"" -- the federal government doesn't count votes!<p>Restrict pay for senators? Seriously, c'mon.

And aren't their studies demonstrating anti-psychotic pharmaceuticals are effective in those cases?<p>Though I am all for data-based scientific reasoning in psychology, I do think there's a place for practical, empirical techniques to treat things we don't quite understand yet (and perhaps don't hope to understand for some time, i.e. a detailed understanding of the operation of the brain).<p>When people have mental health issues they need help now, not in X years when we have sufficient understanding to make it a harder science.<p>I often wonder about the disdain those of the harder sciences have for the 'softer' ones. Physics, chemistry + friends have the wonderful advantage of being able to examine phenomena in the small, once you examine things in the large (such as medical studies, or sociological behaviour, etc.) there are often sufficient factors to make it analytically intractable + require fuzzy uncertain statistical techniques. Does that approach make a science 'soft' in your opinion?<p>I am not for the big fuzzy Freudian unfalsifiable theories that thus can't be tested by the way.

We surrounded him with help and were raising funds for his defense.<p>He had love and support. He kept on expressing optimistic sentiments, like ""this is going to be a good year.""

5362634,comment,5361997,5361997,2,0,cantankerous,,,"I sorta read this post and boiled it down as a protracted ""I'm doing this because it makes me happier"" kinda post.  That's great! I'm wary of basing some general policy so heavily on personal happiness, though.  It's a highly personal and varying thing.  At a personal level, though, happiness/contentment is pretty much paramount.  Do what gives you purpose and fulfills you...otherwise what's the point?<p>I guess what I'm saying is if you want to work from home, do it!  Making the leap to enabling/convincing everybody else to do it may be a bit of a stretch for me, though.  It might not make sense in the general case.",1363103962

Risk II [1] had a mode with simultaneous turns, which was fun for a bit but lost its luster because it was still basically Risk.<p>What I've come to prefer is RTS with a live pause: that is, you can pause at any time to give orders, line up production queues, etc. It works best for single player games, which is what I prefer anyway. Paradox Interactive's games (Crusader Kings series, Hearts of Iron series, Europa Universalis series) are prime examples of this method.<p>(Disclaimer: I worked on a spin-off of Europa Universalis II; see my profile for a link.

As an employee moves up the chain, they spend more time in meetings/managing, less time doing, they get paid more to add less to the bottom line.<p>Unless it becomes obvious to those above that the 3x worker will leave without some recognition/challenge, nothing happens.

Year 2: ""Ugh, okay, what raises can we give you to keep you in your current role?"" Year 3: ""Alright, alright; how much headcount do we now need to justify to replace you after we promote you? Three? Seriously? Holy cow, get the checkbook...""<p>If a 3x-the-work person stews silently and just leaves in a huff without communicating what it is that they want from their chain of command, they miss on all that fun (and several rounds of salary bump).",1363103951

It's because I think that other social problems are merely symptoms of a mindset that allows people to think of themselves as seperate from the social fabric where they live.<p>I believe the way we solve the problem laid out in the OP is by creating resilient local communities that can take care of their own needs with minimal resource input, and I believe that geographic arbitrage and global division of labor have <i>created</i> many of the problems that responses to this post have suggested my money is better spent alleviating.<p>I further believe that when we solve social problems in our own commuities, we create templates for action that can be used by others, and that this is more efficient than using charity to impose solutions for social problems from without.<p>Lastly, I think anybody who thinks of themselves as an island, disconnected from the people and place immediately surrounding them, is delusional.",1363103947

It's not something you measure in work-units-per-hour within the confines of a single day. Same reason you can't have a death-march release cycle and ignore the plummeting ""productivity"" in the days/weeks/months after... or the lost productivity from employees who seek more manageable work elsewhere and need to be replaced, etc.<p>Your post is too one-sided and uses Adderall as a straw-man (or similarly fallacious argument). Your personal happiness as others have said isn't the only factor in an employer-employee relationship -- but that said, viewing productivity as a many-factored, nuanced thing that includes overall worker happiness (or, better put: satisfaction) is probably pretty appropriate.",1363103943

If at the grocery store I momentarily agonize over the selection of Pears or Peaches I don't agonize for long I just grab whichever sounds better ... the solution to that never turns out to be microwaving pizza rolls.<p>""You reject that genetic heritage because you're squeamish?""<p>I reject it because I find it gross (squeamish, whatever) and my 10000 item supermarket provides me with 9999 alternatives.  Well, fewer that are vaguely paleo compatible.  But the point stands, I'm not 5 years old with mom saying ""you have to eat your X"".  Variety and plenty means I don't eat it unless I want to.  I don't particularly care for fried eggs either, that's OK, that leaves me with a mere 1e5 other things to cook and eat.<p>Its a bit different than a BDSM diet like low carb in that you don't ""need"" to eat three pounds of meat per day.  Its more a general reordering of priorities.<p>Your argument is repeatedly analogous to the creationist claims WRT the missing link.  OK you found a fossil filling one gap now, ha ha, now you have to find fossils filling two gaps.  Um no.  Well, OK you've stumped me on tomatoes vs pineapples, which is microscopically better for me, but rather than being paralyzed into a default of dorito consumption, I simply don't care because either are about a factor of 1000x healthier for me than a bag of doritos at snack time.  Or maybe I'll eat some carrots for a snack instead.<p>Also WRT evolution not being a binary process, discussions of 500 years would only be relevant if you think the earth was created in 4000 BC.  Its a little too short sighted.  My oldest ancestors go back a couple billion years and my digestive system as it more or less is today is much older than 500 years.  On the other hand widespread HFCS use is relatively new in the last few decades, kinda like widespread obesity.  Correlation isn't causation, but given reasoned belief that chugging a 2L of regular mt dew per day might kill you in the long run, but eating a carrot a day absolutely will not kill you, its kind of a pascal's wager to eat the carrot at snack time.  And there's nothing wrong with a little corn syrup once in a while ... but something hugely wrong with 40 pounds per capita per year (figure from corn.org for annual HFCS consumption, probably wildly low estimate)<p>Finally its a macronutrient diet, more or less, in that one individual species of apple vs another matters just about as much as the hair color of the cow you eat.  They're not different enough to really matter.  Its an intentional obfuscation of the issue to debate the color of cow hair to carefully avoid the bigger issue of debating celery stalk vs chocolate bar.<p>I will say that paleo as a diet and debating paleo is utterly incompatible with binary thinking.  Its just oil and water.  Religion and science.<p>I am very unimpressed with the alcohol citation about improved poison tolerance.  As a thought experiment I would imagine we have some recent intense evolutionary pressure to detoxify lead.  I propose an experiment where paleo diet fanatics exclude lead from their diet and the anti-paleo diet fanatics add as much lead dust to their diet as possible.  After all, I'm sure its profitable to consume lead, and if the paleo side can't provide a detailed numerical analysis of which heavy metal is more or less toxic than any other heavy metal, we have a moral imperative to consume as much heavy metals as possible, or at least to never intentionally avoid them or encourage others to avoid eating heavy metals.  My opinion disagrees.  A little booze isn't the end of the world, but you're better off without ethanol in your blood.<p>""our monkey/ape guts tell us that we did not evolve with the expectation of eating ""a relatively modest hunk of meat"" for most of our meals.""<p>I agree completely.  That's why on long term average my individual diet averages out to a modest chunk of meat at dinner.  Sometimes more sometimes less.  Fruits for breakfast, mostly, salad for lunch, mostly.  Not unusual not to eat meat for dinner.  But I like it, and when selected and prepared properly its more or less relatively good for me compared to numerous alternatives, so yeah a couple times per week sure.  We may be arguing about the definition of ""modest hunk"", I'm not talking about eating an entire chicken by myself in one sitting or something.  Chicken soup, yeah that's about right.  Or a salad with sliced grilled chicken on it.  Not a 32 oz steak.<p>""That's all fine as a personal or moral belief, but it doesn't make good sense as a general ""mandatory"" consideration.""<p>That's very much like arguing that you cannot order a precise numerical ranking of the quality of different exercises across a world wide range of possible exercises, for example, which is the superior exercise by numerical analysis, slalom snow skiing or jumping jacks or tai chi, furthermore not everyone has identical personal preferences, therefore that lack of universal consensus of numerical rank-ability means no one should ever try to judge the relative value of any exercise under any circumstance and no one should Ever exercise on a regular basis.  100% disagree with both my analogy, your argument, how your conclusion was made, and the conclusion itself.",1363103844

Its an interesting idea and not without some merits.""<p>The article author does not write off panspermia. It is not panspermia that is the issue. His issue with Wickramasinghe is not his support for panspermia, but that he makes claims that pretty much anything and everything is evidence of panspermia, even when it plainly isn't.<p>He addresses specific issues that raises very substantial doubts about the validity of this specific ""research"", and further points out that this quality is part for the course for both the journal it was published in and the researchers.<p>He acknowledges his ad hominem, but also points out that when we want to evaluate whether or not to believe in a claim, whether or not the source is reputable <i>is</i> in fact important unless we have the skill and inclination to accurately assess the claims made ourselves.<p>It <i>is</i> reasonable to be extra sceptical of claims made by someone with a history of making claims that turns out to be totally ridiculous and false, in the interest of not wasting time on every crackpot claim out there.<p>If this was a journal article, this would not have been acceptable - if we take the trouble of formally assessing the claims made, then we should do just that and leave the ad hominems out.<p>But this was not a journal article. And for good reason: Not many who would be likely to read the journal articles and have the skill to assess the claim would take these claims seriously in the first place. But a <i>lot</i> of people will have seen the news reports repeating the dubious claims made.<p>Frankly, your comment comes across like someone who has an axe to grind.<p>> I don't know why scientists just can't keep an open mind. Maybe life comes from outer space. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe diatoms are in meteorites. Maybe they aren't. No one really knows, do they?<p>You're probably right. And the article writer seems to mostly <i>agree</i> with you on this:<p>> Having said that, I do think there is life in space, or at least thats the way to bet. We know there are billions of planets in our galaxy, and we know life on Earth arose almost as soon as conditions on our newly-formed planet were right for it. So Im confident that, statistically speaking, there is life on other planets, at the very least primitive life such as one-celled plants.

> Its even possible life arose on Mars before it did on Earth and was carried here via meteorite. Its an interesting idea. But its one with a lot of holes in it, the biggest being we have zero evidence of life on Mars. Getting it here is not that big a problem, but then having it live long and prosper is another issue altogether.
>
> So to me, panspermia is an interesting idea but has no evidence to support it. There are a host of other problems with it as well, but I think the biggest black eye it has right now is the support it gets from both pseudoscience and sloppy science.<p>He is skeptical, but does not rule it out. He does, however, rule out the specific claims made by Wickramasinghe in this instance based on actually evaluating the evidence presented.",1363102841

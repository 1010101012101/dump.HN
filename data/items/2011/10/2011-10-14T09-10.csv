I can sit here and keep trying to hammer home the same points, over and over, and you'll sit here and keep denying them. So lets just stop this, and you just take my word for it. This project is going to live in source control. If you hate Mercurial and want something simpler, we can switch to something else. But you aren't getting away from this. And any projects we do in the future, will ALSO be in source control. So you may as well make peace with it now.""</i><p>No offence, but I do not think that's called winning over. It's more like he was forced and who knows, he might still be doubting or having apprehensions about using it.<p><i>The thing I believe he was really missing, and that we (I) haven't implemented yet is a continuous integration solution, with simplified deployments directly from the checked in source. His major gripe about not developing directly on the production server was the time it took to see changes. Which is a little silly, but when I look at it from his perspective, I can see his point. If I had taken the time to set that up from the start, he would've seen the benefit of it more immediately.</i><p>I'm afraid I don't really understand this point, can you give an example? I thought everyone can pull one's own copy, make code changes and check out their output/results, and if all's good, just merge/save into main mercurial repository.<p><i>The moral of my story? Always use some kind of VCS. It may seem like a waste of time with just yourself on the project, but you'll always know for sure you have a copy of your work, safe and sound, accessible from anywhere you need it from. Just make it a part of your life, and before you know it, the ""overhead"" of using one will more or less disappear from your life. It's an essential building block to a successful project.</i><p>Well said, I do intend to make it a part of my life, as I don't think I will always be working alone. :)<p><i>I can completely see how, if you had been forced to use VSS for anything, you'd see VCS as something that could get in your way. VSS was/is a blight.</i><p>It wasn't that bad, but I didn't have an ""oh, this is so radical"" kind of moment when I first used it (even though it was). I mean, I was used to taking backups with text file of changes, as I previously mentioned. I guess such an automated system would show its true potential when working in a team, or collaborating over the net.<p>Well, thanks for your thoughts. Appreciate it.",1318585515

Can you provide some reasons for what you have said? I would be interested too.<p>I personally would neither consider Python nor NodeJS for such a project if it was somehow time critical. The reason for this is that I don't know any of those enough to be confident that I could finish the project on time.<p>So the best advice I can give here would be: If you have a hard deadline that is very close stick with the technology you know better. Otherwise stick with the one that is more fun. I <i>guess</i> that you can resolve any performance problems in both technologies. And when your site starts to take off you probably have to re-write and re-design lots of your code anyway (I don't know where I read this first, but it was a startup that took off).",1318585269

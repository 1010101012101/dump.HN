6274728,comment,6273850,6273850,4,0,enriavc,,,"For anyone curious this is the complete text of &quot;Borges and I&quot;. It is much more nuanced than what is implied by the article. I have made minor stylistic changes to Antonios Sarhanis&#x27; English translation available at <a href=""http://anagrammatically.com/2008/01/31/borges-and-i-borges-y-yo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anagrammatically.com/2008/01/31/borges-and-i-borges-y...</a>:<p>&quot;Borges and I&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges<p>To the other one, to Borges, is to whom things happen. I walk through Buenos Aires and I pause, one could say mechanically, to gaze at a vestibules arch and its grillwork; of Borges I receive news in the mail and I see his name in a list of professors or in some biographical dictionary. I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typefaces, etymologies, the taste of coffee and the prose of Stevenson; the other shares these preferences, but in a vain fashion that turns them into the attributes of an actor. It would be an exaggeration to claim that our relationship is hostile; I live, I let myself live so that Borges may weave his literature, and that literature justifies me. It poses no great difficulty for me to confess that he has achieved some valid pages, yet these pages cannot save me, perhaps because whatsoever is good does not belong to anyone, not even to the other, but to language and tradition. In any case, I am destined to lose myself, definitively, and only a fleeting moment of myself will be able to live on in the other. Little by little I am ceding everything to him, even though I am aware of his perverse tendency to falsify and magnify. Spinoza understood that all things strive to persevere in their being; the stone eternally wishes to be a stone and the tiger a tiger. I will remain in Borges, not in myself (if it is that I am someone), but I recognise myself less in his books than in those of many others, or in the laborious strum of a guitar. Years ago, I tried to free myself from him and went on from the mythologies of the slum to games with time and the infinite. But those games are now Borges and I will have to conceive of other things. Thus my life is an escape and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion, or to the other one.<p>I do not know which of the two is writing this page.<p>&quot;Borges y Yo&quot; por Jorge Luis Borges<p>Al otro, a Borges, es a quien le ocurren las cosas. Yo camino por Buenos Aires y me demoro, acaso ya mecnicamente, para mirar el arco de un zagun y la puerta cancel; de Borges tengo noticias por el correo y veo su nombre en una terna de profesores o en un diccionario biogrfico. Me gustan los relojes de arena, los mapas, la tipografa del siglo XVIII, las etimologas, el sabor del caf y la prosa de Stevenson; el otro comparte esas preferencias, pero de un modo vanidoso que las convierte en atributos de un actor. Sera exagerado afirmar que nuestra relacin es hostil; yo vivo, yo me dejo vivir para que Borges pueda tramar su literatura y esa literatura me justifica. Nada me cuesta confesar que ha logrado ciertas pginas vlidas, pero esas pginas no me pueden salvar, quiz porque lo bueno ya no es de nadie, ni siquiera del otro, sino del lenguaje o la tradicin. Por lo dems, yo estoy destinado a perderme, definitivamente, y slo algn instante de m podr sobrevivir en el otro. Poco a poco voy cedindole todo, aunque me consta su perversa costumbre de falsear y magnificar. Spinoza entendi que todas las cosas quieren perseverar en su ser; la piedra eternamente quiere ser piedra y el tigre un tigre. Yo he de quedar en Borges, no en m (si es que alguien soy), pero me reconozco menos en sus libros que en muchos otros o que en el laborioso rasgueo de una guitarra. Hace aos yo trat de librarme de l y pas de las mitologas del arrabal a los juegos con el tiempo y con lo infinito, pero esos juegos son de Borges ahora y tendr que idear otras cosas. As mi vida es una fuga y todo lo pierdo y todo es del olvido, o del otro.<p>No s cul de los dos escribe esta pgina.",1377482340

The primary office I work at is all open, however the acoustics are horrible and the place is extremely noisy.  Days I am in the office are mostly relegated to meetings with other team members and a marginal amount of coding.  Putting in headphones and working at a desk on days we are supposed to be mingling, working with one another, etc is no better than working at home.  That said, two other regional offices which I have spent time in that were also open, while not meeting with direct team members, I was more productive without headphones -- things were generally quiet.<p>When I work at home, I am actually more productive coding than I am in the office due to having more control over both noise and distractions.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to research, I just know I prefer environments that are either quiet or the noise is specifically relevant to myself and colleagues over hearing the ramblings of disparate teams in the background.",1377481888

The algorithms classes I took in college focused a lot on math, logic and proofs. It took me a long time to understand exactly why; I thought we&#x27;d be learning L1 cache hacks and register tricks in Assembly or C. But the technology used to implement the algorithms changes a lot faster than the algorithms themselves, and the details of the best optimizations are different for just about every language. I now think it&#x27;s far more important to have a solid grounding in problem decomposition and theory than it is to understand the intricacies of efficient algorithm designs for a specific language.<p>If you feel like I do, there are two books in particular that come to mind in that their content transcends the normal teaching curriculum and they both force you to think long and hard about how the authors came up with these fantastic little optimizations. I personally learned a lot from trying to reconstruct the thought process that must have led up to some of the algorithms implemented therein.<p>The first book is called <i>Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design</i>, and while it focuses on implementation in Haskell, you don&#x27;t need to be a functional programming expert to get a lot out of the book.<p>The second book is called <i>Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data Structures</i>, and while the name might scare some away, it has a lot of interesting algorithms and accompanying research paper references so you can go off and explore. It took me several years to make my way through it completely, but I have gained a much better understanding of algorithms (and data structures!) that deal with more complex topics (such as computer vision).<p>There&#x27;s one book I&#x27;d like to call out, as well. <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> could be so much better than it is. It has all the right ingredients for a fantastic introduction to algorithms, but the way its written had most people in my algorithms class, myself included, bored beyond belief.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1377481039

Most of the time this is a simple choice.  The app needs a new column that we are storing and so....  But in a multi-app environment there may be other choices, and that dependency injection makes all the difference in the world.<p>EDIT:  for example, if you have a UDF returning the type of a given table, then you may want to use select * because you have already decided these are to be tied together.

Texas, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn_v._Texas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn_v._Texas</a>).

So if the U.S. passes a treaty saying it won&#x27;t do X, then Congress passes a law allowing the President to do X, then the law, being latest in time, overrides the treaty.<p>American courts are fairly hostile towards treaties (something which I think is under the surface of Medellin). Basically treaties are un-democratic. They are written by unelected diplomats and are necessarily the product of foreign influence. It doesn&#x27;t help that one of the motivating factors for the treaty provisions of the U.S. Constitution was the status of the U.S. as a precarious winner of the Revolutionary War. One of the conditions of the Treaty of Paris was that debts on both sides would be recognize. Of course, in most cases Americans were the debtors.

And it wasn&#x27;t explicitly driven by either commercial or basic research, but rather some kind of eccentric blend of the two.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-nlQqFCKg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-nlQqFCKg</a>

The laser beam from Earth will scan a patch of sky and should illuminate the spacecraft at some point. When that happens, the spacecraft will begin transmitting its own laser towards the ground station and the two will lock on to each other. Once that happens, communications can begin.<p>Cool handshake.",1377479200

For example, when going for an outpatient visit to a doctors office that is scheduled in advance. One could argue that the patient has time to review their choices, call different providers and come to a decision. 
This is not the case when the patient is being urgently hospitalized. They are typically rushed to the closest medical center and are subject to the prices it charges and it&#x27;s providers charge. Given that they have no choice, whatever system it is that leads to these high prices is unlikely to change - if you are forced to buy something from me, why wouldn&#x27;t i charge you as much as i feel like for it? 
The government could get involved and force hospitals to adhere to a certain fee schedule - but why should for profit institutions have to adhere to this? In a truly capitalistic society they really shouldn&#x27;t. The best ways to deal with this is to maximize insurance coverage, which is one goal of the affordable care act, and then to really use it as insurance and not to pay for every possible medical service a patient may require. Insurance companies will negotiate reasonable rates for hospitalizations. And if it&#x27;s really being used as insurance and not to cover regular outpatient services, premiums would remain low as well. 
So would there still be stories of the $4 Tylenol tablet dispensed in the hospital? Probably - but in the grand scheme of things, it wouldn&#x27;t matter as much.",1377478835

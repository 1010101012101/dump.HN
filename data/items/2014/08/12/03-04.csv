You&#x27;ve got t-shirts for the rest of your life.<p>In my experience, if you take care of them, wearing them once a week and washing in the machine once a week, they can easily last three years (still good after that, only less nice).  So you would use them at the rythm of 7 each 3 years.  140*3/7 = 60 years.<p>Now of course, you probably have t-shirts of various sizes.  Either you will fatten or get slimer, and be able to wear them all, or you may have your children and your wife wear some of them, but that should still be good for 20 years.<p>Now, you just have to find a startup that would print pants instead of t-shirts, and another with shoes, and and you&#x27;ll be entirely clothed for life!  :-)",1407815691

The way cabs most frequently work in the US is that the drivers are effectively independent contractors who rent the car (and ever valuable medallion) from the taxi company. The companies themselves may or may not accurately report their income, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the fares. Some companies charge a percentage of fares, so in that instance I&#x27;d assume there are more stringent controls.<p>It&#x27;s similar to restaurants in the US, cash tips are drastically underreported and this is fully known by management.",1407815306

On the other hand, it is also true that art forms can essentially die out. Who works with stained glass murals or illuminated manuscripts anymore?<p>It is certainly true that the US constitution can be amended. Nevertheless, we live in a world in which what you want is not [just not the law of the land] but explicitly [forbidden by the land&#x27;s highest legal authority].<p>As I see it, there are two separate conversations here. The first one is whether the changes you&#x27;re proposing would have the effect that you intend. The second is whether the changes you are proposing could be made in our society.<p>My original comment was meant to convince you that this second point wasn&#x27;t reasonable. To change something that&#x27;s unconstitutional is a much bigger deal than just changing something that is currently a law.<p>For the record, I also strongly disagree with you on the first point. I think, and have expressed elsewhere in this thread [0], that the current copyright regime is far too strong to be maximize social welfare.<p>To directly address your original points:\n1) Increasing incentives for authors does not necessarily produce better works. It turns out that money is an exceptionally poor motivator of creative work. Dan Pink has a rather famous TED talk [1] in which among other things he describes how offering people money for a task can make them perform worse at it.\n2) Stronger copyright regimes do not reward creators, they reward rights holders -- a crucial difference. The creative industries are notorious bad actors with respect to the artists that do the work. See for example, Hollywood Accounting [2], the RIAA failing to pay musicians [3], and even when everything goes according to plan &quot;For every $1000 worth of music sold, the average musician makes $23.40.&quot; [4]<p>3) Allow me to quote you for a second. You write<p><pre><code>  > The worst case (and unrealistic) scenario of a stingy heir just doesn&#x27;t matter. If someone deprived us of Sherlock Holmes or Harry Potter or Mickey Mouse or whatever, we would all be just fine. None of them are essential.\n</code></pre>\nIf these works aren&#x27;t essential why should we as a society subsidize the creation of new works through long-lasting monopoly rights? I am rather confused by what difference you perceive between yet-to-be created works and already created works.<p>I&#x27;ve written a lot that probably won&#x27;t be read by anyone, but in conclusion, arguing for an extension of copyright law requires a lot more thought than you seem to have put in.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8143683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8143683</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120305/04332117978/how-big-music-companies-are-stealing-hundreds-millions-royalties-artists.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120305/04332117978/how-b...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2010/07/the_root_investigates_who_really_gets_paid_in_the_music_industry.html?GT1=38002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2010/07/the_root_inv...</a>",1407815259

It seems a conservative estimate. Then the cost of the ride would be $0.55<i>9 + $3.5 + 6 </i> $0.55 = $11.75.<p>Even so, had he got an UberX it would have cost him $12.40, or $11.50, so it&#x27;s really quite comparable.<p>I spent $15 last week going from Union Square SF to the Caltrain station (accidentally picked Uber Black not UberX) - about a mile. It&#x27;s really quite a lot nicer than a taxi. So it&#x27;s really quite close, dollar for dollar<p>But here&#x27;s the thing - SF taxis have (presumably because of past abuses) very rigidly pegged milage to total cost in order to properly compensate drivers. The problem is that this works terribly for further distances. So SFO to Palo Alto will set you back at an absolute minimum about $100, but Millbrae (2 miles fewer) to Palo Alto cost me $30 on UberX. Where I live in the UK, I&#x27;ll spend £20 ($45) on travelling 6 miles after a night out (no traffic) - because the taxis go off meter outside the city limits.

However, because of the hype/valuation trap, investors didn&#x27;t have the patience. So, they have course corrected to add higher margin SAAS/software/financing products (open tickets, invoices....).

The terminology is wrong, but the end result is the same - I backed Planetary Annihilation on kickstarter, and left it, then tried it a few months ago. It definitely wasn&#x27;t in a finished state, regardless of final polish.<p>The problem with the &#x27;alpha&#x27; release system is that it&#x27;s causing a lot of blowback. A lot of users hate it. This system sounds good on paper, but it&#x27;s not working very well, as far as I can see - it feels like for the most part it merely delays failure of a product that wasn&#x27;t going to succeed, rather than create a bunch of things that we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have had access to. There is a <i>lot</i> of alpha release games out there. Planetary Annihilation in particular is a weird one, because the dev team had heavy experience in dev and also business, and got kickstarted way, way above their asking budget... yet despite being an unfinished game for most of the past two years, it&#x27;s been showing up in marketing chaff for much of that.<p>I&#x27;m rambling a bit now, I guess, but my take-home point is that for me personally, the advent of alpha-funded games has not improved my experience, and has actively detracted from it. The honeymoon period is over, and it&#x27;s now being exposed more and more as what it is - nothing like a preorder (yes, yes, no-one ever said it was... but it&#x27;s still the subliminal marketing message), just an investment with a payoff, and given the number of failures, it&#x27;s a bad investment. It moves more risk from the business to the consumers, but there are too many finished, worthy games to bother with taking that risk anyway.",1407814255

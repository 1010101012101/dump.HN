2185913,comment,2185596,2185857,0,0,Udo,,,"> <i>What I'm trying to find out is how much of it is just an opinion and how much is proven.</i><p>There is no significant difference in functional brain structure or organization to suggest these differences are hard-wired. In fact, most of the brain is still considered a black box and basic research is still occupied with finding out how the basic building blocks interact. Sadly, that leaves people who's job it is to examine learned behavior with a lot of room to assert biological predisposition in an attempt to make their (often amateurish) statistical findings more substantial. They get away with it, too, mainly because their opinions are so popular, and their popularity growths with the number of studies appearing in mainstream press in support of the majority world view.<p>> <i>There certainly seems to be a behavioral pattern out there.</i><p>There are many different behavioral patterns out there and what you get to experience depends largely on the country, cultures and subcultures you are embedded in. I'm not denying that behaviors exist, I'm just speaking out against abusing science to falsely attribute underlying biological causes to behavior that is very likely more learned than innate.<p>> <i>What do you mean by ""somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy""?</i><p>I mean the traditional view of gender behavior (which has recently once again become the modern view) is not only imprinting people with a specific bias but also causes humans to behave accordingly. It thus becomes a self-sustaining system, because the more people believe it to be true, the more they behave accordingly, and the more they gather evidence in support of the underlying values. It's a cycle, and confirmation bias does the rest of the work.<p>> <i>When you said ""That is a lie"", I saw what seemed to be categorical denial of the claim that men and women have different capacity for compartmentalization and I was intrigued enough by your vehemence to ask you to point me to what made you so sure.</i><p>Ah, OK, I misunderstood you there. The statement made in the article is not supported by hard science, as far as I know. This is what prompted me to claim the implication that gender behavior is rooted in well-documented scientific observations and models is indeed a lie. Of course, there are many behavioral studies carefully designed show ...pretty much anything you could ever want. But that's not the equivalent of hard science. That's statistics with an agenda.<p>Interestingly enough, there was a popular meme in mainstream media about scientific results ""wearing off"", i.e. becoming less true over time. The results in question used to document this alleged property of the universe were mostly - wait for it - pop psychology studies with agendas behind them. It's telling that these people would rather assume intelligent malice exerted by the universe than admitting their studies were bogus to begin with. These studies are mostly human behavior studies that basically equate popular opinions with universal truths, and then those researchers are shocked, shocked! to find out their results don't hold up over time.",1297011197

Languages that do support concurrency, such as Java, Python, .NET, and Ruby, do it in a brute-force manner. Depending on the implementation - there are over a dozen Ruby interpreters, for example - they may offer ""green threading"" or true multithreading. Neither approach scales, due to reliance on locks. It is left to exotic languages like Erlang to do it right.</i><p>You know how I wrote my first concurrent programs? Create threads with pthread_create(3), and pass ownership of objects by sending pointers over connections created with pipe(3). Which sounds an awful lot like this cure-all actor model (which I hadn't heard of yet) that requires languages almost nobody's ever heard of.<p><i>Of all the approaches taken to multithreading, only one is known to work properly.

When going through concepts I use boxes with arrows and texts - I bet UML people would laugh derisively if I claimed what I drew was UML, my shapes arent even consistent from diagram to diagram.<p>On the next level I use type diagrams ala category theory of functions to figure out what will be needed in code. The diagrams help in terms of thinking out the concepts, also about composition (how FP manages code reuse and extensibility) and setting up guard rails to guide my thinking. The diagrams are also underpinned by a mathematical language and I can do some basic algebra with the concepts before writing code.

I was actually thinking of an app running on a separate IP-based DHT, but your reply brought to my attention that IPFS actually already runs on a DHT.<p>Since IPFS runs on its own DHT, are there any plans for a client-side IPFS DHT library for apps to use to connect to peers on the IPFS network? Similar to <a href=""https://github.com/feross/bittorrent-dht"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/feross/bittorrent-dht</a>, but with native support for IPFS peers?<p>Something like this would make building a client-side real-time app based on IPFS a much more streamlined experience since developers won&#x27;t have to depend on an external DHT.",1441778360

In a statement, a spokesman said, “The technology found in TVs today is more sophisticated than ever before and often requires a level of expertise and technical proficiency to repair most of these high-quality products.”<p>>I’ve heard this argument echoed elsewhere in the electronics industry. But the view is not unanimous: Dell, for one, makes repair guides and parts widely available on its site. So do H-P and Lenovo. Are we to believe that repairing a TV is so much more complicated than poking at a laptop?<p>Opening up a laptop and replacing a part available from the Dell online store is an entirely different scenario to fixing a burnt out TV...<p>Would the author be arguing the same thing if he&#x27;d tried to fix something himself and been zapped in the process?",1441778146

Belief in the supernatural is unscientific <i>by definition</i>: once something crosses into the natural realm it comes under the dominion of science. In the meantime, God will not pop into existence if enough people believe in him. Even if I am so persuasive that I can convince every living physicist that I&#x27;m immune to the laws of gravity, when I jump off a tall enough bridge I will still plummet to my death. If the fate of our species should we continue on the path we&#x27;re on, is the collapse of our civilization and binding to this one planet until our eventual extinction, then that is what will happen regardless of whatever clever arguments against climate change you can conjure up. The combined willpower of every living human being could not so much as change the spin of a single electron. The universe is indifferent, and it is hard to overstate just how <i>dangerous</i> it is to ignore this basic fact.<p>Moreover, taking a strong standpoint is absolutely justified based on the strength of the evidence. To do otherwise implies that the evidence is not so strong. And again, controversy-value has no bearing on this, either.",1441777690

By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#x27;t, or where it isn&#x27;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#x27;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#x27;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#x27;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#x27;t. 
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#x27;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn&#x27;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.<p>The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#x27;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#x27;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#x27;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.&quot;<p>Audio on yt[1]<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ</a>",1441777139

648624,comment,648393,648616,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Good call.<p>The speculation isn't unfounded though, although it isn't appreciably strong here. Word choice comes substantially faster when the most efficient expression can be chosen without any self-monitoring. It's quite plausible that in this case you'll find less instances of tip of the tongue.<p>While the experiment here relied on rare words, and I'm just one data point, but I get ToT probably once for every 2000 words I say. When rapid code-switching is consciously available, I can quickly avert it because I have fast access to good candidate words, which reduces the apparent occurrence.<p>If ToT is taken as a speech disfluency from unresolved competition for word access, you could mitigate it simply by creating an imbalance between the signal strength such that winner takes all (in which case the subway example does demonstrate something useful, although as you point out, the variables are jumbled up). Somehow I got a deja vu just now. This has been discussed here before, or somewhere, or what I am writing is coming from something else I have read...<p>I also realize that ToT cannot be reduced to simple competition, but it is also plausible that slow access and competition manifest similarly, i.e. obstructed speech flow, while partial semantic access. WEAVER++ tried to explain this and I liked it very much (obviously I don't know what's state of the art now).",1244529494
648622,story,,,8,25,chanux,"ASK HN: Illegal Book/Mp3/* Downloads.",,"Hello HNers,<p>Today I stuck in an argument with one of my good buddies about Illegal book downloads. The guy believes that illegal book downloads are okay.<p>He refers to it as Borrowing a book from a library. But my point is that libraries have certain restrictions which an illegally downloaded e-book does not give us.<p>Then he said the deleting the book after referencing is OK. I don't agree with that because it doesn't help proving his ""library theory"" in anyway.<p>Then he asked me why I always refer to a physical library. Then my argument was that true online libraries do not give a complete copy of the book to download. Maybe they just let read it online but not save it locally in anyway (not in an easy way at least). I gave Google books as a close example. SO he said he would rather prefer Google style than than downloading a whole book. But then again Google do not give the whole book to read. That's how it differ from an online library & Google has a reason for that. ""The complete content has a value"".<p>I know there are lots of ACTUALLY free books out there. There the thing is the authors are so great not to expect money for whatever time/effort they put in creating content. But if the author expect for money & we bypass the paying step in anyway, I believe it's illegal.<p>This is the case with the software that has a price & software that are zero cost. If the author expect money we should give him/her. But it's always good (err.. GREAT) to have DRM free digital copy.<p>What do you dear HNers think about this argument?",1244528664

Fluent casual speech isn't the best place to look for such disfluencies anyway, so i don't know that listening to people on the subway is a good demonstration.<p>Also, while code-switching may be a way to get around tip of the tongue experiences, it is a considerably more complicated phenomenon, and there is likely to be a variety of other factors and considerations to take into account when studying code-switching.",1244528177

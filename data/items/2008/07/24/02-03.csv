If you don't have that, you're just making minor improvements to match a certain sound, rather than actually writing something that can push a product's marketing a long way forward.",1216867866

B-schools don't really teach anything; they're actually a way to signal to potential employers that you could come up with the 100k and 2 years necessary to go through school, the smarts to get through admissions, the persistence to get through it, and the willingness to absorb bullshit management-speak (meaning you'll be obedient).",1216867747

255016,comment,254107,254527,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"<i>Even Ayn Rand would probably quibble with that definition.</i><p>Really?  He was actually paraphrasing Ayn Rand.  Although, she would probably put it more like this:<p>>>><p>The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. <i>Without property rights, no other rights are possible.</i> Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.<p>Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.<p>“Man’s Rights,” The Virtue of Selfishness, 94<p>>>>",1216867030

255012,comment,254107,254811,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"<i>I assume that people respond to incentives.</i><p>You hit the nail on the head there.<p>People do what the incentives say they'll do.  The incentives may be rational or not, but whatever they are, that's what you can bet people will do, and you'll be right almost 100% of the time.  The biggest difference between dogs and people is that people learn faster; but the nature of the learning is roughly the same.  Cookie = do that again; swat = don't do that again.<p>Capitalism protects individual freedom, which is morally right.  Incidentally, it also turns the incentives towards efficient use of resources, which is in the public's best interest.  I find it mystifying that progressives claim to impose regulation for the public good, when that almost always leads to a very wasteful misuse of resources that hurts the public in the end.",1216866625

Basically the base system scans through the enclosed variables, checks if they're trivial, and encodes them directly if so; if not, it puts the data for retrieval somewhere.<p>Mostly I'm concentrating on keeping Arc succint, and modifying the base system without, if possible, modifying higher-level code.<p>In any case your suggested implementation does look good.<p>> if it is you return the existing id (this can be done efficiently by having two hash tables: ids->values and values->ids).<p><a href=""http://arclanguage.com/item?id=3858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.com/item?id=3858</a>",1216866464

And I complain about the unfairness of our immigration policy constantly.  A few of the best hackers I know are from other countries.<p>I completely disagree that I'm ""at risk more than I gain"" from increased immigration.  If they can do as good a job as me for less money, then that's the market, and I'll have to accept that.  But really good programmers -- the top 5% that are 5-26 times more productive than the rest -- are always going to be rare, and it's worth a pay cut to be able to work with them.<p>Incidentally, with our current system, tech workers are often given a visa that is only good for the duration of their employment <i>with a single company</i>.  That means, if my coworker wants to go to another company, he has to get a whole new visa, which is incredibly non-trivial.  As a result, my employer can skimp on his pay, because of the added cost of changing jobs.<p>If they pay immigrants less, then that brings down the whole market, including my salary.  If our doors were open, we'd have more immigrants, but they'd be more able to negotiate, and we'd all be on equal footing.  More people means higher housing costs, the weight of which tends to spread out the population distribution and make workers more demanding.",1216865905

Unfortunately, the track record of this philosophy is pretty awful.  Most of the time, top down planning by people who think they know best for society results in utter disaster.  Read ""The Power Broker"" about Robert Moses in New York, or ""Urbanism and its End"" about urban renewal in New Haven.  ""The Triumph of Conservatism"" and the ""Assault on Parenthood"" are also very good books on the subject.<p>I care about helping others, but I don't think the vehicle for doing so is a mega-sized bureaucracy that sits on a former marshland a half-continent away from me.

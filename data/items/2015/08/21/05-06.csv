Imba is still 35x faster than react on the &#x27;everything&#x27; benchmark (and even faster on the others). I still would write my apps exactly like they are in the original benchmark, but do you agree that the [&#x27;_&#x27; + i] change removes what you call &#x27;sneaky code&#x27;?<p>UPDATE: Since the performance was just as good with this dumber type of caching I have changed the actual benchmark to work this way. Would you still consider that caching sneaky? If so, I&#x27;m not sure what to say. Yes, Imba caches dom nodes for reuse. That is the whole philosophy behind its &#x27;virtual dom&#x27;. Now it does not &#x27;leak memory&#x27; anymore either, even though this &#x27;leak&#x27; is a feature (ref comment about manual pruning) and not a bug.",1440136797

The most fun ones were energizing and are (to be honest) the things I seek out when looking for a new opportunity. The #1 thing that I ask when I look at a new job now is &quot;Will I have fun?&quot; #2 is &quot;Is this good for me?&quot; I&#x27;m still chasing after 2 different feelings:<p>1. Working with a couple of colleagues to finish an integration, finishing it, then booking a last-minute tee time to go play golf in celebration. It was a rewarding moment.<p>2. Getting together with teammates every couple of days for &quot;Halo-thirty,&quot; where we&#x27;d break, get together in the afternoons for some halo3 in our teamroom, goof off for a bit, then get back to work. That team was remarkably-fun to be in and around.<p>I&#x27;ve actually found it a bit liberating now that I know what i&#x27;m looking for.

Usually you get a mentor and they nurture you fairly well or help you to help yourself (if it&#x27;s a good internship and not a &quot;oh free codemonkey&quot; mindset).\nI&#x27;d say dev internships are way ahead of the curve compared to other industries.<p>The real problem (imo) is that while there&#x27;s a huge demand for developers at the end of the day it&#x27;s still hard to program well and there&#x27;s a potentially strong penalty on being sloppy while learning and on top of that the opportunity cost of people nurturing you from zero/a low level is pretty high.\nThere&#x27;s a difference between being able to glue working stuff together and understanding an existing codebase. Most jobs require the latter and solid engineering principles on top.\nI&#x27;m afraid there is no hotfix/silver bullet.<p>Call this apprenticeship or whatever you want, I agree that the right step is taking time to develop talent even if it costs you money now.\nBut the downside is that the workforce is ultramobile so you may invest a lot for no return.<p>I think the management trainee programs of bigger companies could be an interesting model to investigate. They are essentially meant to groom and train future >middle management through on the job training in all areas of the company.",1440136527

Fluentd came about precisely because syslog family of data collectors fall short in certain ways:<p>1. tag-based data routing: as you get more and more data sources, it becomes very important to keep track of what goes where. In my view, this is one of the key reasons Fluentd is used at many companies, and why Kafka has become popular on the message queue side (topic-based stream modeling)<p>2. Extensibility: afaik, it&#x27;s not all that intuitive for most programmers and sysadmins to extend and add new inputs, outputs, filters, etc. for rsyslog and/or syslog-ng. Admittedly, this is a subjective point, but looking at both Logstash and Fluentd&#x27;s vast lists of plugins [1][2], I feel justified to make this claim.<p>3. Configurable transport logic: I&#x27;ve never met anyone who is happy with syslog&#x27;s buffering and/or failovers.

Thanks for taking the time to looking through the benchmark. I think you are misinterpreting things. Yes we do caching, and yes IF your app created a million tasks every second you would need to manually dereference them at some point. But you could change the caching (as mentioned in the comment) to never cache additional tags (instead of disabling all caching - which would be like going into the code of Mithril and React and remove all checks in the virtual dom).<p>I&#x27;m really glad to hear that it is still faster even when removing caching. That, to me, is quite insane. But if you wrote a TodoMVC app in Imba, you would do it _exactly_ like the one that is benchmarked. We have even considered adding asserts to warn users if they use uncached nodes in rendering that happens very frequently.<p>You are actually right that Imba does not dereference these automatically (see other comment re purging by judofyr: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10092454"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10092454</a>). We could dereference unused tags once every second or so, but for now we think it is better to have manual control of this. Again, how much is usually happening during a render-cycle? Basically nothing. This benchmark is trying to look at how expensive it is to rerender the whole view. Maybe I should make the &quot;Unchanged render&quot; benchmark the main attraction (as it is the most important) -- but it is quite boring to look at.",1440133491

If Stockfighter works well then I would guess IT recruiters <i>will</i> do the same thing, else they&#x27;ll be competing against a company with a tremendous advantage over them and they&#x27;ll lose lots of their competitive advantage.<p>To that end, it might be worthwhile starting a company to build something similar to Stockfighter that can easily be whitelabelled for recruitment companies.",1440133396

Otherwise I&#x27;ll be thinking about work and productivity up until the point where I literally become unconscious (fall asleep).<p>Sometimes I read/listen to educational stuff. I try to keep it on the lighter side. Sometimes I listen/watch comedy. Right now I&#x27;ve been watching Seinfeld before bed. Before that was Khan Academy history.<p>I remember hearing advice from some credible source (that I can&#x27;t remember) that it&#x27;s not good to keep trying to fall asleep when you are struggling. I think 20 minutes was the point where it was recommended to get out of bed and do something else for a bit. Anecdotally, it works reasonably well for me.",1440133265

It&#x27;s possible, abstractly speaking, but both unduly difficult and unlikely to end well. If by some miracle it doesn&#x27;t fall over in the short term, it&#x27;s highly likely to be a major problem when it comes time for serious renovations.<p>I think the situation we&#x27;re in is an uncomfortable one. Basically, the tech world needs people, and the four-year approach seems too slow. Sadly, nothing I&#x27;ve seen - and I&#x27;ve been affiliated with a bootcamp - seems to both provide the people required and give them the grounding for a career.<p>We as an industry have this burning need to believe that there must be something better. However, I submit that this is the equivalent of protesting &quot;There must be a better way!&quot; when confronted with an uncomfortable policy decision. In both cases the sentiment is laudable, but fails to conjure the alternative into being.<p>It is a good opportunity for somebody. As near as I can tell, that somebody is the four-year CS programs of the world.<p>The only alternative I can see is bifurcating development work into high-skill people who know CS and low-skill code monkeys. I&#x27;m uncomfortable with this, but I suppose it could be workable. We&#x27;d just have to disabuse all those code monkeys of the illusion that they&#x27;re going to become computer scientists.",1440133212

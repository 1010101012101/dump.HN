The bug tracking is fairly solid and they serve as an excellent source code host<p>* Hardware : Amazon EC2. We also use cloudfront (CDN) and a couple of other services. It's worked out amazingly well really.<p>* Accounting: My wife (PhD in Accounting). She uses Quickbooks I think. We use ADP for our payroll for quite awhile and that was <i>nightmare</i>. They were late with W2's and failed to pay the proper taxes they said they were paying. Just awful. My wife does payroll now.<p>* Email: We use authsmtp as our gateway. They've been very solid. Very few spam box issues. We also use mailchimp to manage our actual contact lists.<p>* Analytics: we use a combination of homegrown tools, google analytics, UserFly and CrazyEgg for usability and conversion analysis.<p>* Email: we use Google Apps. That's also worked out extremely well for us. No real issues and we rely on Google Docs quite a bit.<p>* Other services: We use Twilio to handle phone-tracking (it's an integral part of our product). We used UserVoice at one point and that was excellent.<p>I'll update with other stuff as I think about it.",1284105582

1678199,comment,1675131,1677100,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I think a lot of the complaints about having to use ObjC come from folks that (a) find it inferior to one or more languages they already know (Python, Ruby, etc.) and/or (b) feel it is somewhat of a platform ghetto (effectively only used on iOS and Mac) and therefore not as efficient use of one's time investment as another language and stack that you can use on many other platforms, and for many other types of applications.<p>The biggest problem with Objective-C, in my opinion, is that the syntax and philosophy is a step backwards in time in terms of programmer friendliness. It is so much more verbose and clunky compared to Python, for example. Use Python's built-in dictionary type a while, then be forced to use Objective-C's dictionaries. Yikes. Then the memory model is more complex and more prone to error due to inconsistent lifecyles and naming conventions. The XCode/iOS project model, build generation and signing crud is just nasty compared to how you can develop and deliver web apps to production in, say, Python, or even desktop apps. It's just a nasty and overly complicated rat's nest of special cases. I counted once and an iPhone app has something like 8+ different names or identifiers, each used in subtly different ways in different places, just asking for confusion and conflict. I ship a desktop app or web app and I have effectively one or two identities to deal with, and no Apple hoop-jumping to do, no publication delays, no long silly list of things I can and cannot do, etc.: <i>heaven</i> in comparison.<p>And no it's not about learning something new. I'm personally on like my 8th language used professionally, and love learning new things. But sometimes ""new"" things are worse than what you already know. In that case, learning that new thing is bad, and a poor use of your time. I've learned enough Objective-C to be productive, but also enough to know it's a step backward from some other tools in my toolbox, so bad use of my time in an ideal world. I'm <i>thrilled</i> about Apple's change today because it raises hope I might be able to use a sexier language than ObjC/C/C++.",1284104501

Even when you can do it, it's a 1-dimensional signal.  It's not even clear you <i>want</i> to control it consciously; EEG therapy is used in psychiatry every now and then for treatment of a few disorders, and can lead to personality changes.  The ""inverse EEG"" problem, which relates to the distortion caused by the skull, is basically computationally intractable (which is why ECoG is used).  EEG is also totally drowned out by EMG (muscles) if you aren't careful, and it's nearly impossible to tell EMG and EOG (eye movements) apart from ""real"" EEG.<p>In Emotiv's specific case, though, these fundamentals are the least of their problems.

Overnight, without notice, they changed their long time published pricing from pay-as-you-go (fee per transaction) to high monthly fees. For many, the cost was orders of magnitude higher. They arbitrarily decided the API would only remain accessible if you bought the highest priced plan.<p>It'd be fine if they gave notice of the change or grandfathered people in, but at least initially, they didn't. They just wrote condescending, insulting blog posts telling us all how we should appreciate their rate hikes. If you weren't happy with (or able to pay) the higher prices and had already integrated Recurly with your site, you were essentially held hostage. They have all your customer billing information, not you. If you want to keep billing customers, your revenue!, while you strip out Recurly and implement some other payment system and get all your users to sign up again, you've gotta pay to keep your account open in the meantime.<p>Eventually they figured out that screwing with their users like this wasn't a good idea after all, backtracked and came up with a new pricing scheme more like the original, but it's really too late at that point. Revenue is what makes a business. You don't play games with who you trust that to. And nobody should ever trust it to Recurly, since they're more than willing to play games with you.<p>If you want to outsource subscription management, check out Spreedly and Chargify. They've proven themselves more trustworthy than Recurly by far. Really, I recommend doing it yourself though, it's not that bad. PayPal subscriptions and IPN can take you a long way with minimal coding.",1284102786

Please review my product",,"link: http://truedat.net/<p>Hi folks - Truedat lets you track the console video games you own and want; it recommends you games; and it lets you create 'watch lists' on video game prices, where you automatically receive emails whenever the price you want to pay is reached. The service is totally free, and I make money through Amazon's affiliate commissions.<p>Here are a couple example use cases:<p>* There are ten games you want to buy right now, but you can't simultaneously play all of them. You order two games now, and add the other eight to your truedat wants list. Truedat automatically emails you when your target price is hit.<p>* It's the beginning of September; the Holiday Games Onslaught is about to start, but there is still at least a week left and you want a new game to tide you over. You use Truedat to quickly find the best, cheapest game from the past year you forgot to buy, and you order it.<p>Here's what I'd like to know from you:<p>1. I'm too close to the product, now. What sucks? I'm sure the body copy does. Would this make any sense to you if you just happened on my site? What else sucks?<p>2. Would you use this? If no, why not? Does this satisfy a need you have? Assuming you are an avid or semi-avid console gamer, is this a painkiller or a vitamin? (http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2006/03/is_your_product.html)<p>3. Anything else you have to say about this. I'd love as much feedback as I can get.<p>thanks for your time and input!<p>Aaron",1284102197

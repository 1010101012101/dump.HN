I'll try to describe it better and maybe that will help show where it's off.<p>Where our idea is different is that we're not just offering video upload or a quick how-to site, but a complete training system for a fraction of the cost of any of our competitors, and with zero technical setup. We do much more than text or video in our lesson builders, but we also combine that with lesson delivery, sales, communication and assessment tools, and various privacy levels as well (free public lessons, paid public lessons, private lessons, etc).<p>We don't see YouTube as a competitor, since they just provide video delivery, which isn't functional or private enough for companies to deliver their private training through.<p>We've taken the essence of online learning and built a simple way of achieving that all in one place. That certainly has similarities to other services like YouTube (we both allow video upload), but I wouldn't use Flickr for training either, now that they do video as well... ;)<p>What is new about Dojo versus our competitors is that it provides an informal learning experience specifically for companies and trainers (no grades :), and is technically and financially more affordable for anyone. The existing solutions are prohibitively expensive for most companies, and most including the open source tools are geared towards formal learning institutions as their primary focus.<p>After that mouthful, I guess we'll go back over our site and see if we can hone the message a bit now :)",1215276855

S&P/oil is more disturbing, because despite the complaints about oil speculators, the fact is that the current oil run-up has a lot more to do with geology and international politics than ""speculators"". However, if you want to see the real, incontrovertable proof of a ""silent crash"", look at S&P/euro. It's ugly.<p>The 1980s-90s bull market was fed by a couple of factors which are not likely to repeat, and if anything, will unwind. The first is that a lot of middle-class people came into the stock market, due to online trading and the replacement of traditional pension funds with 401k plans. Until 1980, stocks were considered a rich peoples' game, too risky for the mom-n'-pop investor. In 2008, after US equities showed an abysmal performance, it's unlikely that many new investors are going to come into them as they did in the '80s.<p>The second factor is that there has been an expansion of large corporations into all aspects of American life, with Wal-Marts knocking out local shops and mass media gaining ownership of average Americans' minds and desires. This trend is going to reverse for two reasons. The first is that our fairly long-standing energy crisis (call it ""peak oil"" if you wish) is going to make a lot of corporate business models less competitive, leading to increasing localization. The second is that upper-middle-class Americans, who drive the culture and started this trend toward suburbanization and corporatization in the 1920s-50s, just don't like corporate anymore. They buy produce at farmer's markets, avoid chain restaurants, and prefer the internet over TV. These two factors are going to cause a glacial retreat of the corporate state that will continue even once the economy starts to recover.",1215276196
237045,comment,236808,237030,0,0,gizmo,,,"First of all - you should disregard unusual personal experiences if you don't know of any way to repeat them. I dream. I even start halucinating when I don't sleep enough. People can even dream and halucinate under fairly ordinary circumstances. Given the tendency for people to halucinate, I see no reason to seek for supernatural explanations.<p>""Human consciousness"" doesn't need to be something metaphysical. The brain is basically a big petri dish. Chemical reactions everywhere. Our understanding of it is poor, but we're making lots of progress. We know which regions serve which purpose, and we can make people laugh or cry by sticking electrodes in somebody's head during brain surgery. We can see people enjoying music, by watching electrical activity, and we can see how brains of savants differ from ours. The more we learn, the less of a mystery the brain becomes. But we still have 95% to explain.<p>As you make computer programs more complex you realize that sooner or later you have to start meta-programming. Only by making a program introspect itself or the system around it can you give it additional functionality. Windows Vista is a good example - it's all about processing watching other processes work. Watching memory patterns, to improve cache efficiency. Monitoring which programs are run often. Watching which clusters on the hard drive are suspiciously unresponsive. Meta. Meta meta meta.<p>Windows Vista is conscious in the sense that it feels when programs are unresponsive, or when the system has trouble shutting down. And it will try to take measures to fix it. Isn't this just basic consciousness? Nothing spiritual about it. And when you can explain consciousness by just saying it's a function of complexity of a brain we have a pretty plausible answer.<p>Does your cell phone have consciousness? Yes, but very little. Less than an ant, probably.<p>How about babies? Yes, but only as much consciousness as a cat.<p>How about a rock? Yes, about as much consciousness as a ""Hello World"" program. That's simply no consciousness at all.<p>Consciousness doesn't need to be a binary switch. A spark that people get at some point. A ""soul"" doesn't explain anything.<p>You probably don't agree with the way I frame my answers.

Well, I believe you would get very bored quickly, and the only logical solution is to run some experiments.  I would start small (lets for arguments sake say at the molecular level, but almost certainly it would be at a smaller level in our perceived world) and create every possibility.  That would not take very long - so you would have to create an infinite number of expanding test areas.  Each one of these you could equate to what we consider our universe.  So basically you are testing every possible 'path' that could exist.<p>I haven't put it very well to words here due to time constraints - but basically it seems like a logical conclusion that we exist in one of these 'paths'.",1215275670

However, empirical reincarnation research (e.g. the work of Ian Stevenson) can be done, and early results are promising.

This doesn't mean that we live in a deterministic world, but that we live in a physical one that is constantly taking ""pushes"" from a spiritual beings. This seems supernatural and unlikely, but if we believe that the spirit (consciousness) is not an illusion, then we accept that a complex physical system, the brain, can be affected by a spiritual entity, human consciousness, and so it doesn't seem implausible that there are other spiritual beings among us, doing things like rigging the seemingly ""random"" collisions of particles so that 10^-20000 improbabilities (life) actually happen.

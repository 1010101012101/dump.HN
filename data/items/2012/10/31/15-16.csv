IE times when the hardware existed & the demand existed: netbooks & ""mobile."" The latter wasn't really an opportunity because the company that built the hardware & generated the demand also made the software. Still it was enough of a gap that android snuck in.<p>Ubuntu & Mozilla had a wide open chance with Netbooks for a couple of years. There was demand. Manufacturers were keen. Vista was bombing. Users would have excepted an OS that didn't run everything as long as it had some lite browser, lite office app, Skype, media player and a few other bits and pieces optimized for the little display. You could have gotten away with not having MS office or Apple itunes, especially on the first generation Eee.<p>Both of those opportunities existed because of the millions of apps also know as websites that they could run before any developer even knew they existed. I don't think there will ever be an ""in"" that big.<p>e-ink phones?.. Maybe. Battery life would definitely be a selling point. Some people need phones that last longer. But it's predefined as a niche market. It wouldn't be very good on the web (try using a browser on an e-ink to see what I mean. It's cute, but that's it.) so it would need custom apps. Without apps I would love to see music players and email clients for e-ink, it'd be super futuristic. But, to get developers you need scale and excitement.

Soundcloud is also ripe for disruption because their interface of overlaying comments on the waveform while playing tracks is at best distracting and at worst causes my web browser to crash all the time.<p>When listening to soundcloud I use this bookmark to turn off comments on the page:<p><pre><code>   javascript:(function(){$(""a[class='comments-toggle']"").click();})();\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Do you have any additional filters on your sources, or are you straight-up playing the streams as-is?<p>I'd suggest putting in min/max song lengths (to strip out the 2min previews of tracks that sometimes get posted). Although I think your sources are clean enough to handle that. You probably want a 15 min maximum to skip over mixes that sometimes get posted (or better yet, give a playlist for listening to continuous mixes)<p>If the soundcloud api provides favourites you could use that as an input as well.<p>---<p>You could pretty much create a simple version of last.fm by using a ""similar artists search"" and then mutiplexing the individual soundcloud pages for artists.<p>So you could have a ""sounds like Skrillex"", ""sounds like High Rankin"", ""sounds like Knife Party"" etc where all it does is randomly play tracks from similar artists.",1351698825

That said, GOOG's current share price (~670) is higher than AAPL's current price, and near its all time high (~700).<p>2) If you meant to compare total values, that Apple should be worth as much as Google... Apple is over twice Google's total value (550B to 220B) so that'd be an enormous decline in value.<p>3) If you meant to compare relative value (price/performance), Apple is actually a better ""deal"" for investors in that its P/E is around 14, the market average, while Google's is 21. 14 dollars in Apple will create $1 in earnings, but 21 dollars in Google is required to do the same.",1351698825

I've found that three factors affect how attracted developers are to a project:<p>1) How much effort the originator put in to defining the product.<p>2) How competent the originator appears to be (lack of technical competence can be offset by willingness to research and learn on one's own, as well as good quality presentation).<p>3) How well a project aligns with the developer's own interest.<p>By the numbers:<p>1) This is a bare minimum effort. No developer who looks at this project will come away with the impression that you're serious about this, because you've done 10 minutes worth of work.<p>2) You have a Github account, so that means you're probably a developer as well, so you get points for technical knowledge. The README.md is well formatted and presents a pretty clear end-goal, so you're in good shape here.<p>3) I think a lot of developers would find this project interesting. Node.js is hot right now, so there is a lot of interest, even if a Node runtime for a web browser isn't entirely pragmatic, it is at least interesting.<p>So based on the responses here, it looks like you're getting hammered over the first criteria. Unfortunately, that's probably the most important one. No one wants to jump on board a project where the project originator isn't vested. There's very little keeping you from walking away from this as soon as things get rolling, then your name is on the repo and everyone who has done the work is left to languish in the background.

But they're semantically identical, which I think was the author's point.  You declare the data instead of assembling it, and you do it in the same order and in the same manner.   There's more typing but the idiom is the same.<p>This is something that I think a lot of people miss about modern C++.  They make the mistake of assuming you still program it using C idioms, when often you don't have to.  They assume you have to ""manually manage memory"" when obvious and simple RAII techniques have basically obsoleted that for probably 90% of cases.<p>It's just not like that.  If you have a problem that is ""easy to express"" in Python/Perl/Ruby/Javascript it is expressable in essentially the same way in C++.<p>The gotcha to my mind is more that the C++ environment is unforgiving -- a novice python programmer making a syntax error generally bangs around and gets it to work, maybe with some odd thought errors someone else will have to clean up.  A novice C++ programmer is lost until they find an expert to explain the problem.  So I don't think web engineers need to worry about losing their jobs to C++ hackers quite yet.<p>But at the same time, the intuition that C++ is ""hard"" is mostly wrong.  A true expert can solve the same problems the scripting languages do, arriving at essentially equivalent code, in very similar time and with very similar (potentially higher due to typesafety) quality.",1351697840

Further you need the bandwidth to shove that data around.<p>Compute - If you want to 'render' to the display rather than just copy bitmaps around, or composite complex bit maps, you need to spend a lot of time computing which can make other things slow.<p>So when you look closely at tablets you will see interesting places where they have been adapted to support these densities.<p>But more importantly there is 'change' in the systems where there is new money being invested. So tablets are getting all of the 'change' now, less so with laptops, and hardly at all with desktops.<p>The reason this will change though is that I expect we've convinced display manufacturers that 'regular users' (the bulk of the purchasers) want 'high dpi' displays. Its not easy communicating with an entire industry but success Apple has been having with 'retina' displays, and the more recent Android tablets with higher resolutions, means more people will jump in to support them. And more importantly when the choice is available folks <i>reject</i> lower density displays. So in the great 'tuning' these guys do where they calculate how to get the most money out of each hour of running their factories, the equation is tipping in favor of high dpi displays.<p>That said, I'd love to have a couple of 32"" 2560 x 1600 displays for my desktop, but I think that is still a couple of years off from being 'mainstream'",1351697266

I have a tiling setup that I can quickly switch/move windows around, it keeps my vision and neck focused and reduces strain to both.  It allows me to better mentally focus on what I'm currently working on, instead of having my IDE, source control, collab tool, bug tracker, etc, always visible at the same time.

Spectacular with my MBA, this thing is as fast as last year's Macbook Pro and the iMac the year before. I've been writing software professionally since '96 and at least in the windows world, the tools have not changed a whole lot in that time period.

4723186,comment,4721550,4721770,7,0,chrisdone,,,"> The benefits of that kind of stuff are arguable<p>I'll argue for and against some of these points. My perspective should be somewhat contentious as a dyed-in-the-wool Haskell user. We take the side-effects and the static type stuff to an extreme. Should be more interesting to read.<p>> you can do serialization in a static language, but you can't just slap in a call to JSON.load on a file with complex structure and then access the result the same way as native types)<p>That's accurate. It's kind of the point. If a field of a data structure is going to disappear depending on the contents of some arbitrary input, I'd consider that a flaw. It's convenient to say foo.bar as opposed to foo ! ""bar"", but the latter (in Haskell) is explicit about the expected type it infers. For example, I can do this:<p><pre><code>    > json <- readFile ""/tmp/foo.json""\n    > putStrLn json\n     {""firstName"": ""John"", ""lastName"": ""Smith"", ""age"": 25, ""address"": { ""city"": ""New York""}}\n    > do let decade x = div x 10 * 10\n              group n  = show (decade n) ++ ""-"" ++ show (decade (n+10))\n          person    <- decode json\n          firstname <- person ! ""firstName""\n          age       <- person ! ""age""\n          address   <- person ! ""address"" >>= readJSON\n          city      <- address ! ""city""\n          return (""The name is "" ++ firstname ++ "" who is age "" ++ group age ++ "", and he lives in "" ++ city)\n     Ok ""The name is John who is age 20-30, and he lives in New York""\n</code></pre>\nWhether `person' is a string, or `age' is an int, is inferred by its use. I could also explicitly add type signatures. Type inference and type-classes give you something that you don't have in Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, whatever. The decode function is polymorphic on the type it parses, so if you add a type annotation, you can tell it what to parse:<p><pre><code>    > decode ""1"" :: Result Int\n    Ok 1\n    > decode ""1"" :: Result String\n    Error ""Unable to read String""\n</code></pre>\nOr you can just use the variable and type inference will figure it out:<p><pre><code>    > do x <- decode ""1""; return (x * 5)\n    Ok 5\n    > do x <- decode ""[123]""; return (x * 5)\n    Error ""Unable to read Integer""\n    > \n</code></pre>\nSo you have (1) a static proof that the existence and type of things are coherent with your actual code that uses it, (2) the parsing of the JSON is left separate to its use. And that's what this is, parsing. The code x * 5 is never even run, it stops at the decoding step. Now use your imagination and replace x * 5 with normal code. If you take a value decoded from JSON and use it as an integer when it's ""null"", that's your failure to parse properly. What do you send back to the user of your API or whatever, a sorry an exception was thrown somewhere in my codebase?<p>If you want additional validation, you can go there:<p><pre><code>    > do person <- decode json\n          firstname <- person !?

Maybe I only validate a few fields for invariants, but ALL data should be well-typed. That's just sound engineering. This doesn't throw an exception, either, by the way. The whole thing in all these examples are in a Result value. The monad is equivalent to C#'s LINQ. Consider it like a JSON querying DSL. It just returns Error or Ok.<p>Types can also be used to derive unit tests. I can talk about that more if interested.<p>> proxy/remote objects<p>Again, the above applies.<p>> monkey patching (in various forms - raw monkey patching is bad style anyway, but even things like random global callbacks are hard or bad style in most static languages),<p>Well, yeah, as you say, monkey patching isn't even a concept. I don't know what a random global call back is for. Sounds like bad style in any language.<p>> objects that pretend to be A but are really B (perhaps to avoid changing existing code; perhaps to implement things like ""pseudo-string that's an infinite series of As"" or ""rope"" or ""list that loads the relevant data from a file when an item is accessed"" without having to change all the code to make ""string"" and ""list"" typeclasses/interfaces; perhaps for mocking during testing)<p>That's true. There is no way around that. I was recently working on a code generator and I changed the resulting string type from a list of characters to a rope, technically I only needed to change the import from Data.Text to Data.Sequence, but it's usually a bit of refactoring to do. (In the end, it turned out the rope was no faster.)<p>> dynamic loading<p>Technically I've run my IRC server from within GHCi (Haskell's REPL) in order to inspect the state of the program while it was running to see was going on with a bug. I usually just test individual functions in the REPL, but this was a hard bug. I even made some functions updateable, I rewrote them in the REPL while it was running. I've also done this while working with my Kinect from Haskell and doing OpenGL coding. You can't really go re-starting those kind of processes. But that's because I'm awesome, not because Haskell is particularly good at that or endorses it.<p>GHC's support for dynamic code reloading is not good. It could be, it could be completely decent. There was an old Haskell implementation that was more like Smalltalk or Lisp in the way you could update code live, but GHC won and GHC doesn't focus much on this aspect. I don't think static types is the road-block here, in fact I think it's very helpful with migration. In Lisp (in which live updating of code and data types/classes is bread and butter), you often end up confused with an inconsistent program state (the 'image') and are waiting for some function to bail out.<p>But technically, Ruby, Python, Perl and so-called dynamic languages also suck at this style of programming. Smalltalk and Lisp mastered it in the 80's. They set a standard back then. But everyone seems to have forgotten.<p>> REPL (in running code, that gives you the flexibility to change anything you want), ...<p>See above.<p>> The benefits of that kind of stuff are arguable, but I think the net effect is that static languages, even when they save you from having to write out a lot of types, encourage a fairly different style from dynamic languages, which I prefer.<p>Yeah, some of them are good but static languages can't do, some are bad that static languages wouldn't want to do by the principle of it, some are good that static languages don't do but could do.<p>> p.s.: you don't need a static type system to use an option type. :)<p>This is a pretty odd thing to say, because you don't need an option type in most if not all dynamic languages, they all have implicit null anyway. All values are option types. The point of a stronger type system is that null explicit, i.e. null == 2 is a type error. And a static type system tells you that before you run the code.",1351696668

But most surprisingly, despite that I tried my best thinking about how to make it as efficient as possible in every detail when writing C++ version, and that I'm quite new to Go, the Go version still achieves nearly 100% higher throughput than C++ version.<p>Maybe my C++ skill sucks. But I guess I'll just let it suck.",1351695884

I've been a web and .NET guy for 10+ years and this is my first game in OpenGL and Objective-C. The transition from the C# world wasn't too bad.<p>I started building the app for iPad and then adapted it for iPhone and iPhone 5. The aspect ratio differences meant that loading background images got a little trickier but the basic game play algorithms worked fine.<p>The app was rejected at first as ""crude/offensive"" and it took a week to clear that up since it falls under the ""political speech/satire"" exception. It took another week to get my second rejection for ""UI doesn't meet expectations."" No one would tell me why but I think it was because my original buttons were translucent and the Apple HIG says to make buttons 3D and ""touchable."" Start to finish it was about 1 month from first upload to availabe on the app store.<p>Let me know what you think. Democrats, Republicans and Independents should all enjoy the game.<p>You can download Chief Chompers for Free here:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chief-chompers/id566462174?ls=1&mt=8",1351695748

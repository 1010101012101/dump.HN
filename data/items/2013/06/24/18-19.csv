Slavery was abolished when the state refused to recognize that human being can be owned by anybody and so nobody could make a person to work for another person unvoluntarily. Since then, all employment is voluntary. What the article asks for is to ban voluntary employment of some sort because of some stupid ideas of this columnist about how everybody else should behave.<p>>>> Well, a lot of people seems to not like it, but keeps doing it not to be seen as an asshole.<p>So to ask for the government coercion to force people to change the whole way their business works - on the way probably putting a lot of people out of business and out of work is not being asshole, but actually standing up for what you believe in - is being asshole? Talk about perverted ethics... That&#x27;s like saying the only moral way of doing charity is if you hire a thug to mug somebody and then donate the proceeds.

I can do it again and very briefly: it absolutely does not matter if you don&#x27;t like how other people pay for their services and how other people earn their money, and how they behave in general, provided these people are happy with the arrangement.

5934880,comment,5933211,5933729,22,0,ANTSANTS,,,"That&#x27;s a little different from the tricks described in the article, though: Not a last-minute hack, but a deliberate space compromise of the kind that these games absolutely were built around.<p>Ever notice that a lot of old games have very repetitive worlds? Most of them are built around what some call a &quot;room sprite&quot;: a prefabricated room that can be placed anywhere in the world. The world, then, is not much more than a big array of of indices into an array of expensive room sprites.<p>That&#x27;s relatively straightforward, but it gets interesting when you store some information about an instance of a room separately from the &quot;sprite&quot; itself. Simplest example: If you store the hardware color palette and/or tilemap information separately, you can use the same basic room in different dungeons and make it look significantly different each time.<p>If a game has a generic &quot;item room&quot; (like the ones in Metroid or Zelda), you can bet that each instance of that room only needs to specify a single byte representing the item to be found in it.<p>A more interesting application are the doors in Zelda: They&#x27;re not a part of the &quot;room sprite&quot; itself. Instead, for each possible north, south, east, and west door, there&#x27;s a simple bitflag that enumerates a few possibilities: &quot;no door on this wall, there is an open door, there is a locked door, there is a door that you must trigger an event to open, etc.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know if Zelda does this, but it would be pretty easy to allow rooms to be flipped horizontally or vertically as well.<p>Just these few techniques, a dozen rooms, and thoughtful game design would probably be enough to get a few decent dungeons that would take hours to beat, out of a modicum of kilobytes.<p>My favorite example of this idea: If you really explore the original Metroid, you&#x27;ll find a lot of hidden bombable paths that don&#x27;t always lead anywhere. For instance, all item rooms have a pipe underneath them that can be entered by bombing a nearby block, but in most of the rooms, the pipe doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere. If you don&#x27;t know any better, it seems like the designers are just playing with your curiosity. In hindsight, it&#x27;s totally obvious that this was a trick to let the game designers choose whether or not to put a secret passageway behind a particular item room just by lining up a different room next to it!<p>Once you get this, you see it everywhere in the world. You start recognizing different room sprites, and memorize the where their hidden paths are located. With that and the realization that the game only ever scrolls along one axis at a time, the seemingly impossible task of mapping out the entire world (&quot;do they really expect me to shoot every single wall?&quot;) quickly becomes a simple effort of pattern memorization. Sadly, most people who try the original Metroid today get tired of climbing up those long vertical shafts and starting with only 30 health and quit before they even get a chance to discover this metagame.",1372099842

There&#x27;s no mystery, no external dependencies, no existing work I&#x27;m riding off of: everything that happens is visible to me in an immediate way.<p>There&#x27;s a value & use to immutable images, but please decouple your image making from past images made: no one wants to root around to figure out what twelve horrible things you did to install Java 9 image instances back whenever, nor are they going to have any fun reproducing it on the twenty nine active variants of that ancestor image when there&#x27;s a security fix to be done.",1372099731

Once money became &quot;state made&quot;, as you called it, government won an opportunity to manipulate them.

That&#x27;s the who point of perfect forward secrecy; even if you can crack the RSA layer (or obtain the private RSA keys), which is used for bootstrapping the authenticated encrypted channel, perfect forward secrecy generates the symmetric key in a way in which it is never actually communicated over that channel.<p>Perfect forward secrecy protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, work by both sides coming up with two values, one of which is secret and one of which is passed over the channel, such that both of them can compute the same secret value by combining the private and public values. Even if the &quot;public&quot; values are intercepted, for instance by cracking RSA, you cannot determine the secret values, because you do not have the secret portions of the keys that each side generated.<p>The reason to use RSA in addition to key exchange is that Diffie-Hellman key exchange is not authenticated; someone could MITM you, doing both sides of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, and intercept your communication that way. RSA allows for signing of certificates which can be used to bootstrap the authentication process.<p>So, if RSA gets cracked in the future, then the NSA could at that point MITM all of your future connections. But they could not decrypt your prior conversations, which had been encrypted using a private key generated via a key-exchange protocol that provides perfect forward secrecy.<p><i>edit 2</i>:<p>Hmm. After further investigation, it looks like quantum computers would be able able to break the common &quot;perfect forward secrecy&quot; algorithms as well. So yes, in the case of RSA being broken due to quantum computing taking off, it&#x27;s likely that DH and other discrete log based perfect forward secrecy algorithms will be broken as well.<p>Sigh. Why can&#x27;t we have any NP-complete problems that work cryptographically? While even that isn&#x27;t a guarantee of security against quantum algorithms (after all, it may still be the case that P == NP), there&#x27;s a fairly strong belief that P!=NP and that NP-complete is a disjoint category than quantum polynomial algorithms, and so would give us a better security margin against quantum attacks.",1372099093

Why is there a metal detector?  To keep guns and knives out.  So, there can be caution and fear around guns in clubs.<p>I don&#x27;t think the fear is about just guns.

Wagner.  I like\nclassical music.<p>If forget about\neverything about Wagner except\njust the music, keep just the music,\nand ignore even the libretti,\nf&#x27;get about his love life,\npolitics, connections with wacko\nKing Ludwig, his various essays,\nwhat his wife Cosima wrote about\nsome of what he said in his 60s, some of his \nprofessional fights,\netc. and pay attention\njust to the music, and there only\nthe better, say, 90% of his music,\nand like classical\nmusic, then he can be amazing.  To\nme, astounding.<p>I want to\nget my start up done and then\nwork through some of his orchestration,\nsay, for the &quot;Prelude&quot; to\n&#x27;Parsifal&#x27;, and get an idea how\nthe heck he did it.  The\norchestration for his &quot;Magic\nFire Music&quot;, from &#x27;Die Walkre&#x27;,\nis likely simpler,\nand still I&#x27;d like to work through\nthe details.<p>Heck, I&#x27;d like\nto type in such music and have\na computer-based synthetic orchestra\ncalculate the &#x27;performance&#x27;\nand then adjust the orchestration\nto see what was causing some of the\namazing effects he did achieve.<p>Long ago\nI picked out some of his\n&#x27;themes&#x27; (&#x27;leitmotifs&#x27;) on violin -- they\ncan be simple to play and still\nbe just magic, and much that\nhe did was not at all simple.<p>So, the PBS program mentioned that\nWagner had an idea:  In Munich\nis a big, long, wide street\nwith a big statue in a big\ncircle in the middle and the\nstreet leading up to a big parliament \nbuilding or some such.  So, \nWagner&#x27;s idea was, next to the\nparliament building, put up an\nopera house, by far the biggest\never, and have &#x27;government and\nart&#x27; joined!  And before his opera\nhouse he wanted another long, wide\nstreet.<p>One little problem:  His street would\nrequire leveling much of old Munich,\nmuch as you mentioned.  Well, the\n&#x27;city fathers&#x27; of Munich were not\nquite as taken with Wagner&#x27;s grand\ndreams (likely great to have when\nsitting alone at a piano and writing\nfantastic music about\nfantasies of magic swords,\nflying horses, magic gold\nrings, gods coming to earth \nand mating with humans, etc. but a disaster if\napplied to level much of Munich)\nand turned down Wagner&#x27;s dreams.\nSo later a much more reasonable\nopera house was built for Wagner&#x27;s\nmusic in Bayreuth!<p>Wagner&#x27;s music\nwas a good start on much of\nthe music of Hollywood of the\npast 80 years or so, e.g.,\nMax Steiner&#x27;s music for &#x27;King Kong&#x27;.\nSo, Wagner&#x27;s music has had an\nimpact even without leveling\nmuch of Munich!<p>Generally, if the city fathers of\nMunich can turn down Wagner,\nand maybe also King Ludwig,\nthen generally US city fathers\nwill be somewhat reluctant\nto level large parts of\ntheir cities, <i>Kelo</i> decision or not!",1372098392

This <i>is</i> far more likely than Google shipping off deltas in cron batches. Thus, Google et al. can appear on the PRISM Powerpoint, which just says their data was added to the system.

The Powerpoint presentation is hardly a source of empirical data presenting the technical architecture of the program.<p>This article is attempting to help educate and achieve protection at <i>all hops</i>, not just the hops between you and Google. Perfect Forward Secrecy is just for that purpose--it removes the ability to find your encrypted data crackable via single master key decryption by using temporary keys.<p>So, while Google can only do so much in resisting NSLs, perhaps there is a little bit worth appreciating here.

Regardless of whether he&#x27;s guilty of a crime, an unfair trial is a sign of an unjust society.<p>Though, the same could be said for mass warrantless wiretapping.",1372096850

In your scenario the only viable measure is to send no data at all (aka &quot;don&#x27;t play&quot;).",1372096836

I have never seen a FISC opinion cited to support some point of law (and only one FISA Review Court opinion so cited: 310 F.3d 717), so I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to say that &quot;the FISC has established binding precedent that has very much become the prevailing understanding of &#x27;legal&#x27; where its cases are concerned.&quot;<p>FISC precedent is important in the sense that it guides FISC itself, and it guides grants of foreign intelligence warrants, but at the end of the day, if the government wants to use information collected pursuant to a FISC warrant to prosecute you, it has to do so in a regular U.S. District Court, and that court is not bound in any way by the FISC&#x27;s interpretations of the law. In contrast, in a patent litigation, all the U.S. District Courts are absolutely bound by the Federal Circuit&#x27;s precedent.",1372096826

Researchers like Ian Stevenson have worked on it.<p>Personally, I prefer not to try to remember past-life memories. If there were a reason for it, I would.<p>Also, I tend to think (and I know this is an unpopular view in CS circles) that there probably are some paranormal interactions between consciousness and the world.

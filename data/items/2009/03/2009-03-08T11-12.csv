You could probably harvest even long-ish dictionary-based passwords this way if an attacker manages to embed this in a sufficiently high traffic page.",1236512987

I don't know the technical name for it - it's the professorial thing where the speaker lowers the tone of the voice at the end of the sentence (like the opposite of what you do when asking a question).",1236512667

507165,comment,507064,507107,0,0,pmjordan,,,"As I understand it, you can lose both versions in #2. The rename drops the refcount of the old file to 0, freeing its inode and associated file blocks. If you're lucky, they haven't been overwritten and can still find them. Not easily from an app though. On the other hand, the new file might not have been flushed to disk yet.<p>I suspect this could be solved fs-side using a journal that doesn't just store metadata (as most do) but also file content. Slow, though, as files are effectively written to disk twice.",1236512229

507163,comment,507112,507112,0,0,asmithmd1,,,"Interesting history of TV-B-Gone; all the way from inspiration to recommendations of good Chinese contract manufacturers.<p>Also a good caution about not warning your credit card processor if you are going to be exceeding your stated velocities.  When he first set-up TV-Be-Gone website he thought he was wildly overestimating his first years sales when he told them $100k/year.  Three weeks later he had orders for almost $300k - good problem to have, right?  Well the credit card processor was worried he wouldn't be able to fulfill all those orders so they told him they were holding back the money until he did.  The trouble is he needed that money to pay for the shipment of new stock, almost causing the exact problem they were worried about - He was bailed out by a loan from family.<p>TV-B-Gone now employees 11 people!",1236511948

507158,comment,507038,507038,0,0,extension,,,"I believe the (poorly explained) rationale behind the alert is that the CSRF allows the attacker to brute force the password without triggering a captcha, as happens on the main login page after a couple of bad logins.<p>If you sent out spam containing a CSRF link that tried a dozen or so of the most common passwords, you might get a few hits, though I don't know why anyone would bother. Still, if I were Google, I would just fix it.<p>I'm a bit surprised that Google doesn't have a generic authenticity system for all of their forms, or if they do, why it would be omitted from this one form.",1236511112

What astounds me about the US system is the amount of time it takes to do a phd - the article said 9 years is not uncommon. Regardless of whether there is or is not demand for humanities phds outside or inside academia, I think 9 years is too long - I mean your going to be a student in your 30s.",1236510536

Have a look at the Czech keyboard layout; when I first started learning that language I ended up using the Compose key. Why on Earth would you put diacritics on <i>numerical</i> keys without any kind of logical mapping? At least Polish is 100% logical in this regard (except AltGr-X, but that was unavoidable).<p>The Russian keyboard layout is similarly annoying as the keys are simply <i>not where you expect them</i>. On most systems you can install a phonetic keyboard driver and kinda roll with it - that is, until you have to use a <i>real</i> Russian keyboard, at which point you have to re-learn from scratch.<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t get me started on AZERTY and QWERTZ. What were they thinking?!<p>The point is that on some layouts you can start typing right away; on other, you have to jump through hoops and get frustrated. Not that we can do anything about it now.

And the margin a supplier makes varies greatly.<p>A lot of products sourced in high-street brands comes from a variety of the same global suppliers (some of which sub-contract, some do in-house, and some sub-sub contract).  One month from one supplier, and another month from another (varying by continent, country, to in-country location), for a pretty much identical product.  One supplier may make 10% margin, and another 25%.  It is of concern to the purchaser that a supplier doesn&#x27;t make much of a margin, as they&#x27;re feared as being pushed under, but puzzlement that these suppliers stay in business for decades.  What is more important is turn-around time.  A high-street brand needs a design idea to go from cat-walk to hanger in weeks, not months.  That means logistics have to be extremely tight - design sent (electronically), prototypes mocked and air-mailed back, BOM sourced and often imported (at least in part), and the super-price sensitive suppliers just can&#x27;t deliver here, whatever the margin, let alone the Q+A.  A day turnaround and assurance of delivery time can make a difference more important than 5-15% on the quote.<p>When it comes to cheap textile production, or production of the lowest quality product then yes, price sensitivity is important.  But when it comes to delivering mid-level textile products logistics trump jumping to the lowest margin location (where lack of logistical facilities, bribes, un-predictable delays).<p>I agree things can often improve, but minimum wage has little to do with it.  A functional port and road to a factory are far more important in being competitive than how much a worker costs (except for the cheapest of cheapest textile products).",1422966933

If there&#x27;s no pressure from developed countries, then rising wages and conditions of work in one manufacturing nation will ultimately just mean making themselves less competitive. In some ways there&#x27;s a lot of potential for action on our part, because the effect on final price is so minimal through even drastic increases in worker pay. To take it to absurd levels, you could increase worker pay tenfold, and only add $1 to the cost of $14 shirt [1]. So we only have to care enough to be willing to pay a tiny amount more (12c more to double wages, or spent otherwise to drastically improve working conditions), for it to be worthwhile for companies to market themselves as being decent employers.<p>There are various things we could do. As individuals, you could buy brands which have signed up to some sort of agreement for better treatment of workers - in the UK we have Fair Trade (the main focus is agriculture, but they do seem to do clothes as well), and also the more mainstream Ethical Trading Initiative, which some major high street shops have signed up for.

You only need Agent, the cross-platform configurator application installed on your computer.<p>2. Yes, these remapping scenarios are all possible.<p>3. I&#x27;ve only used staggered layouts up until this point so it was natural to me to design a staggered keyboard but I&#x27;m very interested in matrix keyboards and we plan to design a matrix keyboard in the future if everything goes well.<p>4. This might be possible. I&#x27;m not sure how much SRAM will be available after implementing all the planned functionality.<p>5. Layers are stateless, so you have to keep Fn pressed to use the Fn layer and so on.<p>6. Keymaps, however, are stateful, so you can permamently switch keymaps, not having to keep any modifiers pressed. Hopefully this answers your question.<p>7. The Ultimate Hacking Keyboard is a fully NKRO keyboard and it features diodes in its key matrix so no ghosting will happen if that&#x27;s what you are worried about.<p>8. Yes, you will be able to do all of this. As a matter of fact Linux is our primary development platform.<p>9. Yes, the keymaps and the layers of the keymaps along with all the other configuration settings get permamently saved in to the EEPROM of the keyboard. We also plan to make them easily sharable eventually.",1422965472

Born exactly when the communist regime (supposedly) fell. I know this slogan very well. The problem with it is that when everyone is a principal, noone is a principal.<p>It&#x27;s not about economic development, but philosophical one. People (and all of nature) is in constant movement. From trees spreading seeds, to endorphins in the human brain when you achieve success. If you remove this reward system from the social framework people just stop caring. If you don&#x27;t have a carrot to chase, you stop walking. You see this very clearly when you manage people in any capacity. What you are left with then, is a very, very small group of people involved in making the decisions, contrary to any syndicalism thought. Soon those few people get intoxicated by the power and corruption, in all its forms, erodes the whole system. Slowly, but painfully.<p>When you make policy, you have to be very careful and cautious.

The 1844 book by Engels, <i>The Condition of the Working Class in England</i>, basically a report on the sweatshops of the time, was a huge influence on Marx. From the preface:<p>> Having, at the same time, ample opportunity to watch the middle-classes, your opponents, I soon came to the conclusion that you are right, perfectly right in expecting no support whatever from them. Their interest is diametrically opposed to yours, though they always will try to maintain the contrary and to make you believe in their most hearty sympathy with your fates. Their doings give them the lie. I hope to have collected more than sufficient evidence of the fact, that -- be their words what they please -- the middle-classes intend in reality nothing else but to enrich themselves by your labour while they can sell its produce, and to abandon you to starvation as soon as they cannot make a profit by this indirect trade in human flesh. What have they done to prove their professed goodwill towards you? Have they ever paid any serious attention to your grievances? Have they done more than paying the expenses of half-a-dozen commissions of inquiry, whose voluminous reports are damned to everlasting slumber among heaps of waste paper on the shelves of the Home Office? Have they even done as much as to compile from those rotting blue-books a single readable book from which everybody might easily get some information on the condition of the great majority of &quot;free-born Britons&quot;? Not they indeed, those are things they do not like to speak of -- they have left it to a foreigner to inform the civilised world of the degrading situation you have to live in.",1422965195

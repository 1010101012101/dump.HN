Pacing of the book is considerably faster than Halloway's so it's convenient if you like faster paced books. I was itching for a highlighter when reading through the stuff, but the material is interesting. The most interesting chapters, however, are the bits that they haven't gotten up to yet. Write faster! ;)<p>The promo discount code is pretty substantial, total cost of the print book was ~$33 shipped.",1263581985

It seems like such a great idea - the spammers will have been caught, but they won't <i>know</i> it.  Unfortunately I think we've found over time that the negative consequences for users who are falsely flagged as being spammers just aren't worth it, and we have become more explicit about telling users they've been flagged in some way.<p>Long story short: If you're going to disable some action I think it's actually better in the long run to make it obvious that's what you're doing.",1263581795

Fascist systems seem to tolerate private enterprise better than communist ones, though the government tends to pick winners and losers (and shamelessly back the winners with force, as in the Chinalco example).<p>Of course, in such a system, the government is <i>still</i> mucking about in the economy, substituting cronyism for market decisions, and trying to dictate profits and define their rate of economic growth just like that state legislature tried to redefine pi.  Even Europe and the post-bailout US look like libertarian fantasies of free enterprise and transparency in comparison.<p>We have nothing to fear from the Chinese Model.  Their explosive economic growth has almost certainly been exaggerated, and even if taken at face value, this fascist system still leaves China, aside from a few rich spots, closer to the third world than the first.  Companies dealing with China should be aware of what they're getting into - but to put it coldly, they should do so at their own risk, without tariffs or rattled sabers on their behalf when things go wrong.<p>Tangentially, I'm a little amused that ""locovorism"" has a better cachet than open ""anti-globalism"".",1263581786

I think there is some niche potential for tablet devices--hospitals, drawing, books (as you mentioned).<p>On the other hand, e-book readers have found success by doing things laptops can't, like lasting for a week on a charge, being legible in bright sunlight, and being extremely lightweight.  I don't see the same happening for movies (laptops are better for movies since you don't have to hold them up) or music (iPhone/Android wins for that).<p>Also, e-book readers are replacing books, so while you're carrying another device around, it's probably a net reduction in size and weight for most people.<p>Here's a concept that would sell like hotcakes:  Laptop with a dual mode LCD/e-ink 10"", touch-sensitive, swivel display that can be held like a tablet, 24hr (or more) battery life, half-inch thick and less than a pound.

1055552,comment,1055316,1055420,0,0,gruseom,,,"The campaign against saturated fat was itself spearheaded by the vegetable oil and processed food industries. I remember hearing a series of CBC radio broadcasts about this a number of years ago, and the role played by these industrial interests in shaping a pseudo-scientific nutritional consensus was striking. All that nonsense about how eggs will kill you, etc. etc., which was foisted on the public for a generation, was propaganda.<p>It seems the ship is now slowly being righted. The OP looks like a great example of this. I wonder how much mainstream attention it will pick up.<p>Edit: one interesting thing I remember from that radio series, which does not often get mentioned, is how much fear people had about heart disease in the 1950s and 60s. The meme of the seemingly-healthy middle-aged man who suddenly drops dead of a heart attack no longer has the power it once did. (Other fears have taken its place.) But in the early days of the campaign against saturated fat, this fear was widespread and highly exploitable, and it was deliberately and very successfully exploited. (This, at least, was what the radio program argued, credibly to me at the time. I'd like to hear it again.)",1263581485

This comes from the fake grass installed in a large covered sports stadium in Houston, Texas.  The stadium was the home of a sports team called the Houston Astros, so the fake grassy turf was called astroturf.<p>2.  Grassroots.  In politics, ""grassroots support"" refers to support from individuals and/or small, independent groups.  The analogy is that you get scattered support from the bottom up from small groups, like grass growing all around, rather than the support of a single large group like a big tree.<p>So you combine these phrases to get ""astroturfing"" - fake grass, like astroturf, that is meant to give the appearance of widespread ""grassroots"" support.  The term can be used more generally outside of politics to mean artificially creating the appearance that a person/thing is more popular with the general public than it really is.<p>For example, I once read that during the Department of Justice's antitrust case against Microsoft over Internet Explorer, Microsoft hired a PR firm that proposed to send letters to newspapers across the country under different names, each letter written in support of Microsoft's position.  This would give the appearance of widespread support and popularity for Microsoft, even though all the letters would actually come from a PR firm.  That's astroturfing.",1263580319

But then you need another 8 to get up to twelve, 16 to get to 16, 32 to get to 20, etc. Downvoting would be similar but without the positive bias, ie 4 to -4, then another 8 to get to -8, etc.<p>By removing the possibility of ""windfall"" results, that system might be reducing the incentive to appeal to the mob in the first place.

1055485,comment,1055019,1055046,0,0,solutionyogi,,,"I think the article is SPOT ON. And here's little background about me before I tell you why.<p>I am from India, graduated in 2001, worked for Infosys for little over 2 years. I have been in US since 2004 and I have been doing independent consulting for 5 years now. I have quite a friends who work for Wipro/Satyam/TCS or IBM/Accenture.<p>Let me share my experience working with Infosys. I worked on 5 projects for Infosys and all of them were disaster. Infosys hires fresh college graduates, trains them in programming langauges and asks them to do coding for the project. They have processes for <i>everything</i>. Requirements documentation, design documents, the actual code, deployment, you name a task and I can bet that they have a document which tells how you are supposed to do the task. And you can't really divert from the laid out process very much even when you know that the process doesn't make sense. Compound this with the fact that they have many employees who are not really in to technology, so if you suggest an alternate way of doing anything, you will get shot down. [Infosys hires graduates who have no prior Computer Science/Programming experience and some graduates join Infosys because of the brand name and the salary even when they have zero interest in technology.]<p>Let me give you a concrete example. In 2003/2004, CMM (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model</a>) was all rage. Infosys was obviously CMM Level 5 compliance company. As part of the certification, every project needs to do analysis of the bug count after every release. So it's like, there were 30 bugs during the first release of the project and 25 bugs during the second release of project which means that bug count went down 16% which is less than 25%, the number required by CMM. So we need to fudge the bug tracker. Unfortunately, you can't delete bugs. So we go back and add dummy bugs for the first release increasing the bug count from 30 to 40 and match up the numbers. I called it bullshit and no one would listen to me. In fact, I was threatned that I will not get good performance review (don't get me started on performance reviews) if I don't follow 'the process'. I left Infosys after 2 years and sweared that I would never join a consulting firm again.<p>Based on my heated discussions with friends, I can assure that the story is similar at other consulting companies.<p>I am sure when Infosys was started, it was full of smart people who did the right things and made it into a billion dollar company. But as it got bigger and bigger, the net output is of low quality.<p>And this validates Joel's main point in the article:<p>1. Some things need talent to do really well.\n2. It's hard to scale talent.\n3. One way people try to scale talent is by having the talent create rules for the untalented to follow.\n4. The quality of the resulting product is very low.<p>I started reading Joel in 2003/2004 when I was really frustrated with Infosys and this article hit a home run for me. If you think his analogy doesn't describe the state of big IT consulting companies, I can gurantee that you have never worked at one.",1263580023
1055484,comment,1055276,1055276,0,0,lmkg,,,"Repeating yourself is also a very good example of how written natural language and spoken natural language are very different beasts.<p>If you look at good, effective oratory style, and write it down, it looks totally horrible. One of the major differences is more repetition. When all the words are present, written down on a page, it's easy to go back and re-read. People can also go along at their own pace, make sure they understand before moving on, and are generally more in control of their experience.<p>In spoken language, the opposite is true. You have one chance to express yourself, and you have to make sure it's successful, despite the listening abilities of the audience. So while written language favors variation of vocabulary, because the same word repeated a dozen times stands out as bad style, spoken language uses it as a basic tool of getting a point across.<p>When I deliver presentations, I insert tons of back-references, repeating previous points or conclusions. When using powerpoint, I also insert a lot of forward-references, giving a brief outline of the topics to be immediately covered. I generally try to mimic how, if I were reading an equivalent paper, I would be flipping back through the pages or how I would have to read something a second time to understand it.<p>At the lower level, even sentences are allowed to repeat themselves a lot more in speech than in writing. Where a written story may use a pronoun, speech is more likely to repeat the full noun for emphasis. You can also use the trick of repeating a phrase with different vocal characteristics to emphasize it, which simply doesn't translate into writing without being awkward.",1263580019

For anyone out there who is thinking of joining a startup, my suggestion is that you go in with open eyes, not open heart. If you are going to be hired as employee, make sure you are treated as an employee and are compensated accordingly. The test is simple. Are you going to be paid at market value? If you are, no problem. It would be a great learning experience and you are not taking any financial risk (opportunity risk, may be). But if you are asked to cut back (or even forgo) on salaries, then you are a co-Founder no matter how long the startup has been around, how long the Founder has been working on his/her idea and who is the VC's behind the scene. Make sure you are rewarded as such (i.e., lots of Founder stock, not stock options). Most importantly, you need to learn the difference between ""liking"" someone and ""respecting"" someone. As an entrepreneur, you don't need to ""like"" someone to have a business relationship with them. It is not an ethical violation to pretend to like. You just cannot pretend to ""respect"".",1263578511

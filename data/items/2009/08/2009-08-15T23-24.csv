765389,comment,765016,765318,0,0,whughes,,,"Compared to BeOS, Web apps that are cached are in no way lightweight and responsive. Maybe we're defining lightweight and responsive differently. I am thinking about the real-time media capabilities of BeOS which let you drag around videos on Pentium IIs. I'm thinking about native C++ applications and a completely multithreaded system. I'm thinking about Gobe Productive and native e-mail clients. For me, lightweight runs on a Pentium Pro with 64MB RAM.<p>Gmail is not lightweight. Compared to Yahoo Mail or Live Mail, its design is airy, and it's well-optimized. Let's be honest: Chrome OS is only here to tap the netbooks. It's not going to revive the massive amount of old hardware that BeOS could use. YouTube isn't lightweight. Chrome's process-per-tab system isn't lightweight.",1250380730

Turns out no one opens the door in the morning, it's all the one guy and now I know at least two of us have had it. For now the problem has gone, but at the cost of fuelling his paranoia that we are all out to get him as a group. One more thing and I'm getting him kicked out.<p>Thanks for all the advice guys, it's cool to see how the crowd thinks.",1250380729

It can't be the same as we pay in the shop, or they'd make pennies per 100 rentals.

I think a pure client js + app server js + js db would be fantastic.  Even though the various javascript server libs/frameworks are maturing very fast, I cannot afford to toss perfectly good high level solutions that exist with something like merb: production server process management, integrated release scripts, session management and authentication, etc...  If you go with js server side at the moment, you get to roll your own for all this.<p>I want this to be the answer, but for right now, I can't afford to cut my teeth on it.",1250379670

I end up spending less than I would at a shop, have the tools for next time, and I know the work was done right, on my schedule.<p>Oh, many auto parts stores will rent or loan (for free!) tools that you may only need once.

765366,comment,764931,764931,0,0,jhancock,,,"If your new web app isn't too complex to get bootstrapped, you will learn better if you choose a light framework: ruby - Merb or Sinatra, python - webpy, etc...<p>One of the reasons you see so much disappointment with ruby is people start with rails and that doesn't really help you become a good ruby programmer.  It may actually teach you bad habits and keep you from knowing how the language and http requests, and db requests really work (none of which is that complicated).<p>I use ruby over python.  Mainly because I picked it up first and don't have a good reason to switch.  I use merb as my framework, which is a fine choice, but if I had to start again, I might go with Sinatra.<p>If you do go with Ruby, buy this book: The Ruby Programming Language <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanag...</a><p>I have seen no text that comes close to this new book in teaching Ruby.",1250379184

+ Concise code; no ceremony.
+ Best concurrency paradigm I've seen.  This is huge to me.
+ Effortless integration w/ Java libraries.<p>Cons so far:
- Not the most readable language.  Reminds me more of Perl than Python.  Newbies like me take a while to figure out all the sigils.
- Making Clojure code run fast is non-trivial.  Often a speedup-focused rewrite produces code that is much more obscure than the original.<p>My opinion may change over time, but those are my thoughts currently.  I am really enjoying Clojure.",1250379083

765358,comment,764508,764803,0,0,trapper,,,"Yes. Effect size is the difference in means in proportion to the pooled standard deviation to the two treatments, and is a great measure of how large the difference is. All groups are different given large enough n. Whether that difference means anything is dependent on the effect size.<p>When the effect size is large you know that whatever effect you are seeing is much less likely to be chance. It's also less susceptible to large differences in variation, which the tests you are using to test significance use as an assumption (variation is equal).",1250378329

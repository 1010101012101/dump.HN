But I try to never put anyone down unless it's necessary to achieve something more important. So I'd put down Soviet Communism because I'd like to see a freer, happier Russia, but I'm not going to waste my life putting down XYZ Ice Cream Parlor / Software Company / Whatever for doing something I dislike.<p>It's fashionable and easy to score a few points putting down McDonalds or Microsoft or whatever, and I used to when I was younger. I mean, it's so easy to put down McDonalds, and McD's really is legitimately garbage. But what's to gain from it? It just takes time away from me doing some science, doing some business, connecting with people I do like, reading, writing, painting, lifting weights, playing golf, going to a museum, having sex, swimming, sitting in a park, having a coffee, whatever. I don't need or want the short, easy points and bond that come with assessing my disgust/superiority/whatever over other people and organizations. Time is too precious to spend doing that.",1247986713

What you get out of this will go a long way to making you a better problem solver.  The reason why I say this is when you have to so something like prove why 1 is greater than 0, you'll learn to look at things differently.<p>In studying real analysis, you are almost learning how to walk again.  Everything that you have taken for granted as being obvious in the past will now have to be proven.  And by going through these exercises, you'll learn the importance of truly understanding what you are doing.",1247986561

Real Analysis is  important if one needs to understand thing deeper. In the real world, problems can't be solved analytically... and many of the tools one learns in Calculus are kind of useless. I think Linear Algebra is much, much more important than Calculus. Linear Algebra is the arithmetic of higher mathematics, like Bellman said.",1247986222

It sure isn't mine.<p>>Those who went on to become lawyers, politicians, etc. were indeed elitists but the best among them were highly talented, very bright, and quite capable of making many of our modern politicians look pathetic by comparison in their forms of expression.<p>The ones you've heard of, sure - they are the ones worth remembering.  But if you don't think there were just as many moronic politicians back then you're just being naive.

712686,comment,712198,712631,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"We've been through much worse than this.  The economy is complex enough and our entrepreneurs talented enough that we will rise above this.  The economy gets better under two circumstances in my view:<p>(1)  Large opportunities are available for businesses to invest and make money.<p>(2)  People start spending money again because consumer confidence improves.<p>BTW, the goal is not to produce more than we consume.  That, in my view, is a formula for failure.  The goal is to create a more stable supply and demand curve.  If consumers don't spend enough money, then the problems get worse as a business's gross revenue decreases.<p>If we stop panicking, spend their money, stop with the bail outs, provide tax incentives for entrepeneurs, and most importantly, provide an opportunity for business to make money as well as compete with existing giants, then the recession will start easing into recovery.",1247985988

Providers no longer compete on price, and consumers no longer factor price when selecting providers or moderating their use of resources.  Combined, these factors will make (and already have been making) private alternatives unrealistic for all but the most wealthy, whereas prior to the government takeover of healthcare, high-quality private care was well within reach for (at least) the lower-middle class.",1247985050

712674,comment,712642,712642,0,0,mark-t,,,"To be honest, calculus isn't that important for mathematicians, but if you want to study mathematics seriously, I'd suggest picking up a rigorous text like Rudin's or Apostol's. It will be difficult. You'll have to read most of it several times. That's perfectly fine; the point is that it will help you learn to think like a mathematician does.<p>Now, on the other hand, linear algebra is almost universally important and is probably easier for a programmer to grasp. I would also suggest picking up a Number Theory or Combinatorics text; they're practically useless, but they're fun and interesting, they'll give you a better idea of what mathematicians do, and you don't need much education to get into them.<p>My usual advice for building skills is to work on contest problems. See if you can find some AMC12 problems. If those are too easy, you can work your way up. AIME and Putnam would be good next steps (those can be found here: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080205091131/http://www.kalva.demon.co.uk/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080205091131/http://www.kalva.d...</a> ).",1247985039

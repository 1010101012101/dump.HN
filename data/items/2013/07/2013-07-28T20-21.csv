They would be able to make their own choices about &quot;regular&quot; versus GMO.

6118066,comment,6117055,6117190,5,0,lostlogin,,,"Just to throw in a situation I&#x27;m in at the moment. A public hospital has put out a tender for a new MRI scanner. I know who is likely cheapest (GE) and I know who is likely the most expensive (Siemens). I suspect Philips falls nearer the higher end, but will be in between. I have nothing to do with the purchase but work with those who do. I&#x27;d bet everything I own that GE don&#x27;t win as the corners cut and unreliability are not winning any favours. Their scanner ticks all the boxes, but in the worst possible way. Multi-transmit RF? Yes! (But it doesn&#x27;t work). Wide bore? Yes! (But you can&#x27;t scan any further laterally than with a narrow bore). Propeller type imaging? Yes! (But scanner crashes, weird artifacts arise or the utterly crap interface gets in the way). The list goes on for probably another 50 points. Philips and Siemens have faults, sure. But they are more the result of compromises and are stylistic where the system is that way because someone chose to make it like that. Not because someone screwed up, forgot, didn&#x27;t check, didn&#x27;t know etc. some places chose quality over price, and this publicly owned MRI scanner will be in this category.",1375044747

It only needs a side if it must actively support its own preservation.<p>Consider all the stuff recently revealed by Wikileaks about Iraq and Afghanistan, and also consider the stuff released by Snowden ... None of it had to be kept secret to preserve the government as a whole, the state itself was not threatened in the least bit.  All that was threatened were specific (narrow) 
programs which happen to be things that most Americans would be appalled by if they were known about.<p>So clearly the &quot;side&quot; these entities of government are on is the &quot;side&quot; of keeping their own actions secret so that the public won&#x27;t oppose them and shut them down.<p>That is extremely anti-democratic.

I&#x27;ve already switched from the local bookstore, which was pure mass market and had no scifi or technical books, to B+N, to amazon, now if B+N closes why would I ever switch back from amazon prime to brick and mortar?<p>The other killer is amazon prime.  I&#x27;m paying $70 or whatever it is, to get free shipping and no sales tax.  Anytime I pay spend a penny at B+M even long after I saved my $70 from amazon, I&#x27;m still thinking... I fronted amazon $70 and I need to make it back on free shipping, and its cheaper online anyway, and I won&#x27;t have time to read it until after two-day shipping anyway... so why go brick and mortar?<p>The other problem is, I&#x27;m pretty well read, interested in certain specialties, and 50% of salespeople are below the median anyway, so a local store is useless to me.  I have special ordered books at local bookstores in the distant past; I believe they used USPS media mail and it took about three weeks plus two trips to the store.  I already have amazon prime and it takes two days not three weeks.  So I&#x27;ll probably never buy a new book at a B+M book store again, at least not for myself.  I don&#x27;t know if they can survive off gift sales.<p>There are five interesting options going forward for bookstores:<p>1) Gift store that happens to sell books.<p>2) I donno what to call it, but the sales pitch would be &quot;Don&#x27;t pay for amazon shipping when we can get it next day air no extra charge&quot;.  Of course the base price would be MSRP not amazon discount, to pay for the logistics.<p>3) &quot;We print your book on demand in less than 15 minutes while you drink a complimentary coffee and its still hot when we put it in your hands&quot;<p>4) &quot;We only stock the (insert authority name)&#x27;s top 100 titles... but we know all about those 100 titles, and we never run out of copies&quot;.  AKA the midnight harry potter store, more or less.

  ...
  int x = 3;
  foo(x);

  foo(x);

The question of whether values are passed &quot;by object reference&quot; (my preferred way of describing what they do) is pretty much entirely separate from whether the language is dynamic. For instance: C++ (not dynamic, not p.b.o.r.), Java (not dynamic, p.b.o.r.), MATLAB (dynamic, not p.b.o.r), Python (dynamic, p.b.o.r). C# has the unusual feature that some kinds of mutable objects are passed that way while others -- structs -- are passed by value, with the object (in principle) being copied when the call happens.]",1375044017

You&#x27;d probably be more productive in Vim or [insert favorite proprietary editor here].<p>Emacs Lisp is probably the most featureless language you can think of; it doesn&#x27;t even do basic threading and the async stuff is a joke.  All the major programming language modes are implemented as ad-hoc Elisp regexp parsers making bugs impossible to fix. Virtually _everything_ is implemented in Elisp, because the C code is a gigantic unmaintainable mess. This means that all the pretty high-level stuff like Magit is <i>shit</i> slow. Good features take ages to propagate to upstream, whose reasons are often more political than technical.<p>However, it is the only programmable editor in the world, and people continue to churn out more and more Elisp.  Recent developments like MELPA and Marmalade have made packaging and distributing easier than ever, and users just need to `M-x package-install` to get their favorite packages set up.<p>The reason Emacs has been so successful is very simple: there is one global environment where all symbols are bound; any package can overshadow any existing symbol (variable/function) from anywhere. There are no &quot;core&quot; functions versus &quot;library&quot; functions; any package can modify very &quot;core&quot; behavior (for instance, find-file) very easily [1]. Ofcourse, this has severe downsides: you can eval bad code and screw up your Emacs environment pretty badly (it might even refuse to quit); often the only way to recover is to restart Emacs, flushing the environment.<p>I&#x27;d say: learn as much as you can about editors from this monster; enjoy tinkering with it.

So you end up with a coffee shop, and wifi, with live music, and D+D/Pathfinder RPG get togethers, and author signing visits, an internet cafe, wedding receptions, and dvd sales, and ... where&#x27;s the books?  Had to take them out to make space for the candle shop and onsite child care center...  Not much of a bookstore anymore if walmart has a better quantity and selection.<p>One good rule of thumb is to look up and down small town main street.  If you&#x27;re going to try 50/50 pirate shop and bookstore, you&#x27;re not going to do better than the actual pirate shop store, and you already know 50% of the model (bookstore) doesn&#x27;t work.  Ditto candles, antique stores, herbal soaps, or chocolate candies... simply listing an inventory of small town shops is mostly going to result in lack of focus on multiple business models.  None of which are doing all that well anyway.<p>On a macro level, since I was a kid, total retail CRE square footage per citizen has roughly doubled, but median consumption patterns haven&#x27;t kept up making aggregate brick and mortar retail per citizen drop, and the long term trend isn&#x27;t looking good for retail.

Employee pay and retention. Retail always pays shit, but if you want good employees, you have to pay them.<p>2. Re-zoning continually. B&N spends an inordinate amount of labor re-organizing and shuffling books from one area to the other. This make work makes it hard for customers to find books, makes it hard for associates to know where a book is, and is just shuffling deck chairs.<p>3. Pricing. BN.com is cheaper than B&N stores. Customers don&#x27;t understand this, causing huge amounts of irritation. Plus, B&N is just charging too much.<p>4. Delivery/inventory. Order a book from Amazon, you can have it tomorrow. Order it from B&N or bn.com, and it might take a week. All deliveries are made from central warehouses, instead of leveraging the store&#x27;s own inventory.<p>A smart fix for this would be to have the delivery manager able to deliver books from his inventory overnight to the customer.

Two years ago I read about org-mode here on HN and was inspired to give Emacs a shot. Today Emacs is my main technical hobby. Extending Emacs with Elisp is a pleasure and a joy. My various init files total over 3,000 lines of code that I wrote my own little self.<p>That said, while I remain incredibly impressed with the integrated documentation system, especially the Info manuals for their sheer literacy and clarity, I discovered over time that it doesn&#x27;t adequately teach you &quot;the Lisp way.&quot; Explanations of the basic concepts -- like a symbol for crying out loud -- are scattered and not really complete, leading to frustration as I got deeper into extending Emacs.<p>For me, the light bulb went off after I worked through Seibel&#x27;s Practical Common Lisp. I&#x27;ve also read chunks of PG&#x27;s On Lisp. Together these two outstanding books resulted in an epiphany regarding Lisp and the functional approach in general.<p>The result is that, where before I couldn&#x27;t figure out Emacs&#x27;s own Elisp sources (i.e., &quot;Why is this function written this way, and not that way? Why do I see this idiom so often, what&#x27;s it doing?&quot;), now I can. The payoff for writing my own Elisp has been incalculable.

If you use IP to call, let&#x27;s say via an application like RingCentral, how does the 911 service know whether you&#x27;re in San Francisco or New York? It doesn&#x27;t.<p>This isn&#x27;t pie in the sky fantasy, this is actually how all over the top VoIP connections work. You pick a location and that&#x27;s where your 911 calls originate. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you&#x27;re using your SIP client in New York, your 911 call will still go to a San Francisco 911 center because your office address is in SF. That&#x27;s not good.<p>So IMHO the right approach is a top-down rewrite and rolling that sucker out nationwide. Normally, we&#x27;d see one vendor start to dominate over other vendors, and while there has definitely been some consolidation in the 911 market, the fact that these services are federally mandated (Read: Allocated budget automatically) there&#x27;s not a huge incentive for municipalities to shop around. These systems are essentially free as far as they&#x27;re concerned.<p>Part of the reason we&#x27;re not on IP is because the federal dollars can&#x27;t be legally spent on IP in many places (gotta love lobbying). In short, the correct approach, IMHO, is IP-enabled PSAPs with GPS information for location combined with reform efforts in congress. The logically addressed world of the phone network is a fantasy and our emergency services should model reality instead of our dreams.",1375042837

Why doesn&#x27;t StackExchange have a &quot;race problem&quot;, for example? (And what I really mean by &quot;race problem&quot; is people complaining about it, somehow feeling uncomfortable or discouraged by it, rather than the &quot;problem&quot; itself.)<p>I think Quora&#x27;s more fundamental problem is that the rules of the social game were not well though out. For example, I find that the user&#x27;s feed can become too noisy too quickly. It is too easy for someone to add a crappy unrelated question into a topic you follow.<p>As a result you see people who value their time leaving the social network, no matter how &quot;intellectualist&quot; the network wanted to be in the beginning.<p>Indians just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: exactly at the time of interesting people (including interesting Indians) leaving.<p>Somehow I&#x27;m still hoping to see Quora&#x27;s revival.

Oftentimes, using features supported only by one or a few database management implementations can make things substantially easier.<p>Ports are often difficult and risky without substantial continuous integration all along because of other quirks in the implementation regardless, both of any ORM layer and of the DBMS.<p>One advantage of arrays can be performance: not having to locate several rows in another relation can be a time-saver; in this case it can act like a nicer denormalization.  But, as array elements are not quite first class in SQL (as the manual notes) it doesn&#x27;t work quite as smoothly if one plans to enrich their tags with a lot of meta-information or other relationships.<p>In any case, I have used this strategy on an analytic-oriented system and it worked great: the queries were simple to read, performed well, and the representation of the row was convenient to use in client programs.  I&#x27;ve also used hstore to convenient effect on more OLTP-oriented systems although it too is a Postgres-only (for now) data type extension.",1375041657

Australia is an edge case - the reason that travelling London to Australia takes so long is largely due to poor overland connections after you reach southeast Asia.  You can travel by train from London to e.g. Beijing in around 10-11 days.<p>London to Rome can be done comfortably and cheaply by train in under 24 hours.  Some people prefer this to flying.<p>The website seat61.com has a huge amount of info on travelling internationally by rail.<p>Also I suspect rail travel would suddenly recieve a lot of investment should air travel become impossible.",1271511993

1273004,comment,1272912,1272965,0,0,Terretta,,,"When you say ""format"", do you mean file container or video codec?  Most people mean codec.  In that case, Flash (and Adobe) doesn't have a format to destroy.<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft's work in this area over the past 13 years with the WMV family of codecs has been extraordinary, coaxing more quality from a given bitrate needing less CPU to play back than any other commercially viable codec.  That's why WMV codecs work on so many consumer devices, even phones. VC1 is remarkably good, only just recently challenged by H.264 encoding's most recent optimizations.<p>Meanwhile, if you meant file container, Microsoft's recent player technologies such as Silverlight support H.264 in .mp4 containers, as do recent Flash Player versions.<p>With all Windows machines supporting .WMV container and VC-1 codec, Macs still shipping with a Windows Media Player or able to play it in any QT app using Flip4Mac, Linux players supporting it ""out of the box"", and both Sony PS3 and MSFT Xbox playing it, not to mention most every consumer device and set top box -- if you want to send someone a video that just works, then .WMV using WMV3 or VC1 has been a decent bet.<p>Your newer best bet for sending a file is .mp4 with H.264/AAC, which is played by Flash Player 9 Update, Silverlight, QuickTime, VLC, etc., and more recent Windows systems.<p>For embedding in the web, stats say Flash is your best bet, but those stats apply to VP6 codec which looks terrible and most people don't know how to play locally and doesn't work for HD.<p>So your best bet for embedding is .MP4 with H.264/AAC with an HTML5 tag, and inside that tag a Silverlight player embed, and inside that tag a Flash player embed, and inside that a download link for the .mp4 file.",1271510737

1272988,comment,1272306,1272952,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's probably accurate, but supports something a bit different on the timeline: Stallman opposed a <i>change</i> in the gcc architecture in the 2000s that he thought would make it easier for companies to make proprietary derivatives. But that's not quite the same as saying he wrote it in the 80s to deliberately prevent it from being extensible. When he was writing it in the 80s, getting a whole C compiler written from scratch was probably the bigger design goal.<p>I tend to find the sniping at Stallman over gcc a little annoying overall. There are plenty of ways I disagree with Stallman's strategy, but from a ""show me the code""  perspective, he produced a free-software C compiler suitable for use in a modern free Unix 25 years before any of the MIT/BSD-license proponents did (until llvm, their only real alternative was the original pcc from the 1970s, which is why the BSDs all grudgingly use gcc).",1271509841

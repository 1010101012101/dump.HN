6306948,comment,6302364,6306169,5,0,zbinga,,,"The original was copy-protected, I believe, which means it cannot be archived in the standard .dsk format (there are some more complicated formats that represent a disk at a lower level, but they are not very well supported by emulators). In a few decades, the only surviving copies of many 80s software programs will be the ones that were cracked and distributed widely. In this way, crackers and pirates acted as inadvertent archivists.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the pirated version I had (back in the old days) had your name on it (plus a crack group&#x27;s name and probably BBS phone number). I remember thinking &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s the Apple Writer guy, what else did he write?&quot; and that&#x27;s how I found GraFORTH. Bought Leo Brodie&#x27;s book and had a blast learning the language, then actually implementing small Forth-like languages for the fun of it. There was a Byte book, &quot;Threaded Interpretive Languages&quot; that gave me several epiphanies about programming in general and language design in particular.<p>I used Apple Writer for years, until eventually my typing speed increased so much that the program couldn&#x27;t keep up with me anymore when typing long paragraphs (the word wrap algorithm, that was run after each character, apparently took time proportional to the length of the current paragraph, with a big enough constant that my 1 MHz Apple II started dropping keystrokes regularly despite the program having a 32-character buffer). I eventually resorted to disabling word-wrap while typing, and re-enabling it prior to printing (Control-Z, I think it was). Later, I bought a Zip Chip that increased the computer speed to about 3.5 MHz, and the problem disappeared.<p>I wasn&#x27;t using Apple Writer by then, because I had discovered
another word processor, a weird, Rube Goldberg contraption called Gutenberg Sr. that used double-high-resolution graphics at a time when few programs did, and had a more powerful markup language (troff-inspired, I found out later), could two two-column printing and had some page layout capabilities, and had great support for printer-downloadable fonts, including user-defined ones. The interface was atrocious but the software itself was powerful.",1377961148

That if craigslist earned money, it must somehow be stealing it.<p>Actually, the opposite is true. I think craigslist is so focused on being barebones and profit-free that it actually is doing a disservice to the economy. It took a lot of pressure for Craigslist to add a basic feature, maps integration, and it only did so recently. If craigslist wanted to really contribute to society, it should try earning a bit more money and using it to hire people to make the service better for end-users. Everyone wins.<p>Middle-men are not necessarily evil just because they earn a profit. A genuinely useful middle-man can benefit both himself as well as the other parties in the transaction.

On the other, you don&#x27;t give them a raise, and you lose a key contributer who was bringing in far more revenue than their salary.<p>The fact is, your best employees are going to be constantly getting offers above what you pay them, and you need mechanisms in place to keep them.

When he heard I was learning programming, he introduced me to his sister&#x27;s boyfriend, who was a manager at a local hardware/software firm.<p>The guy met with me, was interested in turning me into a developer and offered me a decent salary to do so.<p>He said he couldn&#x27;t hire enough competent developers.<p>I ended up pursuing another opportunity (large commute at this job + I wanted to build my own stuff), but this impressed on me the high value currently given to STEM expertise. I didn&#x27;t have any! Just an interest was enough.<p>Edit: I has learned the basics of programming, having gone though most of K & R, and a couple of Udacity courses.

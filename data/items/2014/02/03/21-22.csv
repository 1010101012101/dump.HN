If you are interested in why I am so smug just give Lisp a try, if that same smugness puts you off, no problem, nobody minds. I am smug because people rather dare to criticize me that way.<p>Not cheaper in terms of salary. Cheaper in time needed to train. You can use e.g. Python or Ruby without knowing how its implemented (if you knew you wouldn&#x27;t use it). A Lisp programmer automatically needs to be a full stack developer, or at least conscious about the stack, because he is operating a compiler framework. It has lots to do with circular definition and choosing the right tools bottom up. For instance, most of CL can be and is implemented using a core part of the language. What that core is can differ from implementation to implementation. So the barrier between user and creator is very small in Lisp, thats what makes it so powerful and demands its users to be well trained in many aspects of software systems.<p>I think the more knowledge you have of your environment, the better you can solve a problem in it. So I think most programming problems can be better solved in a lisp than in any other language (so far).",1391464382

Stalling is caused by the separation of the airflow over the top of the wing from the wing itself, resulting in a loss of lift, at extreme angles of attack (which would thus present greater angle and surface area for deflection).",1391463855

We still aren&#x27;t anywhere with it. It is more broken than it is working, it is a giant mess.<p>> The Chromecast comparison is really a bad one - yes you can tabcast<p>You can fullscreen cast.<p>> but really it is designed around a &quot;send this URL to play&quot; experience which is much much easier to accomplish than real-time streaming.<p>Except for the tab casting and full screen casting..?<p>> For the real-time streaming, you only have a single sink device to worry about and it only works on desktops (for now).<p>You&#x27;re strangely contradicting yourself. First you acknowledge that tab casting is a thing,then you pretend that tab casting isn&#x27;t something it does and use that as justification for Miracast&#x27;s superiority? Very confusing.<p>Also &quot;only have a single sink device&quot; is total gibberish. Even assuming the word &quot;sync&quot; it is still nonsense, both Miracast and Chromecast only support a single device on either end (sender and receiver).<p>PS - Chromecast works with other devices. It isn&#x27;t just desktops. People already made apps that could send a full Android &quot;desktop&quot; to the Chromecast back in the early days before Google killed it with an update.

We know there are easy problems, and we know there are hard problems, but we don&#x27;t know if there are hard problems that are easy to verify. Intuitively, for many problems it&#x27;s much easier to recognize a correct solution than come up with one.

The problem isn&#x27;t really with features and DRM leading to incompatibility. The HDCP portion of Miracast is pretty straightforward and isn&#x27;t often the problem. The problem (as seen with the charts) is manufacturers that are sorta-kinda-using Miracast but not really. For example the Samsung AllShare devices were never advertised as Miracast capable, but they happen to work (sometimes). Same with the HTC Media Link. Customers get these dongles or TVs and expect it to work with other Miracast devices, even though they aren&#x27;t really Miracast. Give the standard 2014, 2015 and let&#x27;s see where we are.<p>The Chromecast comparison is really a bad one - yes you can tabcast, but really it is designed around a &quot;send this URL to play&quot; experience which is much much easier to accomplish than real-time streaming.

The same policies can have different effects for roles and users (e.g., permission to copy from other buckets).<p>IAM Roles can be useful, especially for bootstrapping (e.g. retrieving an encrypted key store at start-up), but only use them if you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Conversely, tips like disabling SSH have negligible security benefit if you&#x27;re using the default EC2 setup (private key-based login).

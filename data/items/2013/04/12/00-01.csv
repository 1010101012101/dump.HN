He understands his role in the national immigration debate, and he is playing it very well.<p>Many people have the goal of comprehensive immigration reform. To get it accomplished will take a lot of pushing from a lot of different directions.<p>Zuckerberg, as the CEO of one of the most famous ""new economy"" innovative companies, is in the perfect position to talk about high-skilled workers, which is a component of comprehensive reform that will help Republicans accept the bill. He has a ton of personal credibility on this aspect of immigration. FWD.us aggregates other people with similar credibility.<p>He does not have a ton of credibility on issues like re-training former textile workers, or low-skill jobs, or illegal immigrants. If he tried to lobby on those issues he would be dismissed as a typical grandstanding California liberal.

5535863,comment,5535467,5535820,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"I think saying that the tech industry is only a small fraction of our total economy (and the world economy in general). It's a huge growth engine, but most of the jobs and companies out there aren't tech related. If we place too much of an emphasis on recruiting engineers, we risk shutting out other skilled (and unskilled) immigrants.<p>Plenty of immigrants come to America with little more than a strong work ethic and a dream. They may have been too poor or disadvantaged to have afforded college, let alone an engineering degree, in their native countries. Hell, some of their native countries may not even <i>have</i> such opportunities. If we're restricting our search to highly skilled, highly educated workers, we're discriminating against everyone else who wants to participate in the American Dream.<p>Lest we assume these people are necessarily undesirable, we should be reminded of the fact that many of our most successful and quintessentially ""American"" companies were founded by originally unskilled immigrant laborers. Andrew Carnegie is perhaps the most famous example. His family emigrated to the US from Scotland, dirt poor and uneducated. His first job was as a messenger boy. He grew, of course, to become one of America's wealthiest and most productive captains of industry. He didn't have the status ""captain of industry"" before applying to enter the US. He gained that status <i>in</i> the US, via the opportunities afforded by the US to someone of his work ethic and intelligence. (And even the less-than-Carnegian immigrants of the world fill crucial roles in our economy).<p>Now, I <i>disagree</i> with the author in that he thinks a focus on engineers is necessarily a zero-sum game: that placing an emphasis on skilled workers precludes unskilled workers. It doesn't have to. I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater on Zuckerberg's argument, just because it's limited in scope. There's probably a lot more help than harm done by the sorts of reforms the group is seeking.",1365727747

You can sing and play a regular instrument, for example - and don't get started on the argument that there's nothing new under the sun, and that all basslines, drum rhythms etc. consist of ripping off someone else's idea. Musical quotation <i>is</i> widespread, but there is a huge different between coming up with your own riff that sounds a bit like your favorite band and just sampling the original. Furthermore, there's no special reason that sampling has to involve others' work. My main tool is a sampler but I hardly ever sample other people, and when i do it's usually a line from a movie or something, and done more for personal amusement. I would never, ever sample another musician's track and use it in my own music. It's not that it makes me morally superior, I just don't want to do that, because it would feel like I was just surfing on what they did because I couldn't come up with something cool on my own. I don't even care for using royalty-free sample loops of drum breaks or pead sounds for the same reason, although I will use one occasionally.<p>What I <i>do</i> sample is going into the kitchen and making recordings of household implements as percussion, my cats' miaows, sounds in my neighborhood, or my own voice or snippets stuff I'm playing out of synthesizers. For me, it's a lot more fun to come up with my own drum beats or suchlike, sample those, and then start warping the audio to my heart's content.<p>I'm not saying that this makes me a better musician or a better person than people who build records entirely out of samples - I'm not into Girl Talk but there are quite a few artists who work mainly with samples of others' stuff whose work I admire and enjoy. I'm just pointing out that that you can in fact go nuts with your sampler without ever having to deal with copyright clearance or infringement issues.",1365726435

Yes, there are many LinkedIn features that I don't get value from (including the news feed and endorsements). But I've found it invaluable for the one core feature it was built on: keeping in touch with your professional contacts. I'm not going to add all my former co-workers, the interesting people I talk to at conferences and counterparts at other companies on Facebook. I don't care what their kids are doing, or where they went on vacation. But I <i>do</i> want to know if they move to some other interesting job, find out if they're hiring or, most importantly, reach them in the future if I would like their advice or help. With my LinkedIn network, if I ever want to reach someone at Company X, whether it be to talk about a job opportunity or to tell them their API is broken, all I have to do is search that company name. Up comes a list of people at that company, and how connected I am to them. If I don't know anyone who currently works there, I probably know someone who does, and can get an introduction.<p>Before LinkedIn, I'd take business cards or exchange emails with contact information.

Hence blame.<p>Now using further powers of intuition, I believe that you, burntsushi, think that blaming the victim is inherently wrong. Interpreted strictly that means that the behaviour of a victim is always flawless, and and a victim always lacks responsibility for bad outcomes. This is in my mind a quite ridiculous view, so I don't think this is what you mean. So what DO you mean? I will consider two possible guesses and discuss them.<p>>The thief acted wrong. Stealing the coins was immoral.\n-I think we can all agree with this statement.

It may not make it to the promised land, but one of its descendents may.<p><i>>You lost.</i><p>There is no finish line.  This game never ends.  And Bitcoin's success does not necessarily mean the end of government currencies.  I fully expect they will co-exist for a long time.<p>Less emotional investment from both sides, less fixation on price/exchange rate, and more focus on the underlying ideas, technology, and their ramifications, both positive and negative, please.",1365725038

Once you hit North-2 on the right end, and you want to keep turning to the right, it needs to instantly ""skip"" you back to North-1. And vice versa.<p>The thing I haven't figured out how to do in a smooth way is to disable the transition, for that split second to allow for the jump.<p>What I've done so far is give each direction a class with the  corresponding translate. eg. ""go-0, go-1, go-2, go-3, go-4""<p>I've also created two extra classes ""go-0-instant"" and ""go-4-instant"" which, set transition duration to 0 and to skips back to North 1 & 2 instantly.<p>But the problem is that i needs to happen quickly, and once I remove the ""go-0-instant"" class and add the class with enacts the normal rotation, the css gets overridden and the instant translate basically gets overridden.<p>I guess what I'm after is a clean way to do a callback once you know the DOM has picked up on a css class change.<p>I've run into this issue a couple of times before, I would be stoked to learn of the best way to do this!<p>Here's the CoffeeScript file that controls the navigation:\n<a href=""https://github.com/webpop/css-pirate-ship/blob/translate3d/public/navigation.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpop/css-pirate-ship/blob/translate3d/p...</a><p>and the Scss for the cardinal directions:\n<a href=""https://github.com/webpop/css-pirate-ship/blob/translate3d/public/pirates.scss#L32"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpop/css-pirate-ship/blob/translate3d/p...</a>",1365725037
5535706,comment,5534882,5535129,9,0,sixish,,,"Google's character was obvious to me when they insisted their slogan was ""don't be evil"" and not ""do no evil"".<p>A ""do no evil"" pledge is something that can be judged.  Did they do evil by sabotaging the local 'yellow pages' in Africa?  Was using their position on the board of competitors for their own advantage evil?  This phrase refers to events and actions and facts, things that accountability is based on.  Something can even be an honest mistake that does evil.<p>But ""don't be evil"" is an accountability dodge.  Instead of judging actions and events it says to look at the company as a whole.  Is an evil act threatening OEMs with no more Google apps unless they tow the line ok because it's all to 'unify Android'?  Is it okay to sabotage privacy because otherwise Facebook will eat their lunch?  Can two wrongs make a right?<p>The question of whether Google <i>is</i> evil is much more complicated and ambiguous than whether Google does or has done evil.  That they insisted on not being judged based on their actions speaks volumes.",1365725032

Henry Blodget's Internet Outsider blog used to be great, and SAI started nicely, but now it has devolved into a trolling + link-baiting mess. A search for 'killer site:businessinsider.com' shows how many titles they have that are -killer such as 'wikipedia-killer' 'google-killer' etc. They frequently take a poor claim or projection based on little to no evidence that is likely to be controversial, assume it is incontrovertible and publish a litany of bad arguments, stupid opinions and ridiculous forecasts.<p>The comments on these posts reflect the type of people to enjoy such a blog.<p>Peter Kafka used to blog for SAI and during his tenure there his posts were as bad as any other on that site and since he's moved to AllthingsD his posts have improved wholesale and are now informative, interesting and frequently make headlines on memetrackers such as Techmeme. I think it's some kind of policy, and I don't think it works given the greater exposure Kafka gets now than before when he was with SAI.<p>/rant",1250373590

765279,comment,764787,765092,0,0,jsackmann,,,"I'm pretty sure that Starbucks does do some things to discourage people from staying there a long time.  One thing noted in this and other threads is the availability of outlets.  In some larger SBXs, there are tables with power strips; in smaller ones, there may only be one or two tables where you can plug something in.<p>But where things get more interesting are the subtleties.  Before I got an office share, I did a lot of tutoring in SBXs, meaning I'd be there for sometimes 6-8 hours at a stretch.  One thing I noticed in multiple locations was that the music would change--dramatically--every so often.  (Maybe every hour, I don't know.)<p>People think of SBX as having pretty standard cool jazz, laid-back r&b...the genre that might as well be referred to as ""coffeehouse.""  But when it changes up, it can be jarring.  Go from Norah Jones to an old Charlie Parker recording, and it is at least subconsciously disturbing.  It's never blatant, never music that says ""don't stay!"" to someone just walking in, but enough to say, ""time to change gears"" to someone who settled in to one type of music.<p>Of course this is all supposition on my part.  But there has been tons of research done by Musak and others to determine buying patterns based on volume/music type/etc., and if it makes it easy for SBX to <i>say</i> one thing while ever-so-gently nudging people out the door, it seems like a great way to get the desired effect.",1250373341

Hippies and Astrologers, just like any Scientist is left-hemisphere dominant if they're right handed, it doesn't change and you cannot do anything that affects it (aside from maybe a stroke).<p>Astrologers believe in something you don't, and it's very ignorant to say they're deficient in basic mental processes. I'm sure many hippies are, but that's called drug abuse. Scientists can be equally as misled as any astrologer to facts, just read up on the amazing work done by many of our cold-fusion scientists who ignore fundamental scientific concepts like the conservation of mass and energy. Personally, I think astrologers are a lot smarter than any cold-fusion/free energy scientist out there, and those scientists somehow got their hands onto Ph.D's.<p>I'm right-hemisphere dominant, I'm extremely logical, sceptical and I have a high IQ. I scored amazingly in math and science, I'm completely non-religious to the point that I find atheists disturbingly religious in their activities, and I've also worked as a writer. Your brain works the way it works, the way your genes and life have designed it to work. I'm somehow right-hemisphere dominant and out-perform nearly every left-hemisphere dominant people I know at tasks they're supposed to be good at. That's the irony of life.<p>I find Dr Taylor's views to be psycho crackpot work and I give them less credence than my horoscope. She's claiming a lack of left-hemisphere dominance is good, which I'm sorry but personally I really like writing (as anyone can tell from my comments, including this one) and losing the left-hemisphere kind of ruins that whole fun, also talking.<p>She apparently had a stroke, probably lost very minor functioning in her brain and had a religious experience, just like thousands of other people do every year when they have a heart attack, stroke, cancer, hit by a car, girlfriend kicked them in the crotch . . . okay I added the last one, but religious experiences don't necessarily come in the same form. She likely wasn't very religious, so when she had hers she didn't attribute it to god.<p>The whole process of near-death usually helps people not worry about the mundane problems, like your boss being a jerk.

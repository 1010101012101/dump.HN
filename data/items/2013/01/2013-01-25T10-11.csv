Those without require you to report all wins as income and not deduct losses, effectively making it impossible to gamble with any regularity (since you could easily owe taxes on $200k of income, of which you only saw $10k... or worse, -$10k).<p>Pros can simply net their wins/losses (while maintaining a record-keeping notebook). To qualify as a pro you have to derive almost all income from gambling.<p>Gamblers get worried when people want to close tax loopholes (such as itemized deductions for certain things).

Costco thrives on high volume/low count of SKU and customers pay for delivery themselves. Costco's gross margin is 12% vs 23% for Amazon.
Amazon's cost advantage over WalMart is only marginal. About 1 pt lower on the SG&A and 2.5 pts lower on gross margin. But Walmart is a lot more profitable.
The advantage of Amazon vs WalMart is really in the long tail. It can keep more SKUs than even the largest WalMart Supercenter could hope for and still turn its inventory over  much faster. And for items you can wait for you get them delivered to the door.
My own family's shopping behavior is consistent with the data: we buy from Costco if it carries them, esp recurrent consumables; my wife occasionally goes to Target if she needs something soon; for things that we can take time to shop and do some research on I buy from Amazon, sometimes for price but mostly for convenience of not having to go to the store.",1359108757

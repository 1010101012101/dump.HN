A better design would have made it even more sophisticated and harder to learn, IMO.  That's the price to pay for being purely functional.  Instead, I felt that certain design trade-offs were made, which in effect, make the type system awkward and tend to lead to inflexibility in writing ambitious, comprehensive programs.",1285829847

I watched a car getting painted - it was on a catwalk over running water with turbines to capture some energy from the process, and bristles on the turbines to take most of the paint out and recycle the water. The efficiencies are enormous, technology investment very high.<p>I haven't been through so many factories to compare, but the investments in technology I saw seem higher than in the American factories I've been through. Small sample size, though, basically anecdotal, so take me with a grain of salt here.",1285829790

How can they say ""unlimited"" when they don't have the experience to know if it's stable? I suspect they are being overly optimistic.<p>Regarding 200W - I don't know what their swamp cooler needs, and they say they installed solar power. I picked 200W because that looks like a common size for portable home devices.<p>Looking now, I think solar cells are about 20 sq ft for 200 W. Since they need to work during the night as well (though not as much), call it 40 sq. ft of otherwise unused space.

Long morning showers have a profound effect on my ability to concentrate, meditate, think through problems and interestingly nearly 100% of my best ideas and solutions to problems come from the shower. Sometimes I have more than one shower a day to help work through tough problems (both personal, technical and business). I do live in a hot country and work from home so this is easier. If I don't have a shower to start the day I feel incomplete and a nagging feeling all day that something is not quite right!<p>I read all sorts of books to help unwind or enhance my existing knowledge or learn something new. Mixing genres of books each time is also good. I usually read scifi, fantasy (Terry Pratchett anyone?), biographies, history books,science/maths, technical, business... reading is one of mans greatest gifts!<p>Also, learn to do things like crosswords and jigsaws as a way to take your mind off things. Jigsaws are an amazing way to completely switch off - like stacking shelves without the significant labour! Mind wonders, but you also achieve something with each piece laid. Seriously dont knock it until you try :)<p>Exercise is critical. I swim 50+ laps in the pool each day and this really helps. But I hate exercise so you gotta find something that works for you.<p>And of course spending time with family - particularly children if you have them can be a real boon and gives you an excuse to play lego - anther wonderful invention of mankind!

1742452,comment,1741362,1741362,0,0,janj,,,"Reminds me of when I used to mess with telemarketers. My goal was to see how long I could get them to stay on the phone, thinking that the more of their time I wasted the less profitable telemarketing would be (how much of an affect could one person really have though?). I was very successful with a variety of techniques and it turned into a fun game. I almost regret having changed my number, no longer getting these calls now.<p>One good one was when I had this lady first describe her work environment, finding out she was working with her fiance. I had her describe him and their relationship and somehow got her talking about her willingness to engage in a threesome. After almost 15 minutes she politely told me that she had to go, being at work and all. Maybe 10 minutes later her supposed fiance called me back asking why I was talking 'rubbish' to his girlfriend. I talked with him for a while and got him to tell me about their relationship, that they had been engaged for 5 years, got engaged when she was 15! He started describing her physically but finally hung up when I tried to get him to tell me how much she weighed (I was really curious after he told me she was 5'4""). That one was during work and by the end of the conversation I had the entire office sitting around listening.<p>Another time I was walking home when I received a free satellite tv installation offer (during the recorded intro to these calls, before pressing '1' to speak to someone, is the best time to prepare what you're going to say). When the guy came on the line I got him to describe in as much detail as he was willing the contents of each of the porn channels that was included in the service. It's fun to imagine what their going through on their end of the call (sometimes I would get them to yell into the phone claiming I could barely hear them).<p>I think it's really entertaining when they get mad at me for wasting their time! This usually happens when it's a get-out-of-debt scammer. I answer all their questions and they get excited when they hear my monthly credit card bill (never bothering to find out that I pay off the entire balance each month) but then get real upset when I try to convince them that I'm not in need of their 'services'. Half the time they don't believe me, trying to 'comfort' me by telling me that it's ok to be in financial distress, everyone is in debt and are experiencing tough times right now.<p>I tried to think of ways to promote this kind of behavior, figuring if one in ten of their calls were to people like me then telemarketing would be much less profitable, but I never tried to follow through with anything. Now that I don't get these calls anymore I kind of miss it. Over the years I became much more comfortable, confident and competent dealing with telemarketers in this way.",1285827084

Typically, with IPv6, MAC addresses take up the right 48 bits of the 128 bit IPv6 address. other 90 bits are used for subnetting/routing.

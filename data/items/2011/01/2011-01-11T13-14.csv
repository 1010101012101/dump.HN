2091844,comment,2090678,2091377,0,0,cwp,,,"I think klenwell has at least part of the answer:<p><i>Chua probably believes that its her strictness and strong principles that are leading her children to excel. And these have their role, no doubt. But I would propose, following Harris, it is her oppressive control of their social lives which is the much stronger factor.</i><p>Piano and violin are commonly played in isolation! This supports the Chinese parenting style in several ways:<p>• You don't have to practice with other musicians. Sure, a dedicated trumpeter spends a lot of time playing scales by himself, but to actually perform, you typically need to be in a band, orchestra, quartet or whatever. This means practicing as a group, and introduces opportunities for social interaction which might undermine parental control.<p>• Soloists don't have to share their glory. From what I can see, the Chinese drive to push their children to succeed has a lot to do with the way a successful child reflects on the parent. Shared
success doesn't help the parent compete with other parents.<p>• It allows the parent to control the material. An awful lot of music is fundamentally rebellious, and the last thing a Chinese parent wants is their child learning jazz or rock or reggae and thinking about what it means.<p>I fact, I have to wonder if the point of pushing music so hard is to soak up the child's spare time, with an activity that leaves no time for a social life.",1294753883

To get even 2:1, given their current Android install base they'd have to get every current iPhone user in the US to switch, or generate a similar number from new users or RIMM and Android defectors (with Android defectors counting twice since they reduce the Android count too, so they ""only"" need the same number as half the US installed base of iPhone to switch from Android).",1294753800

2091837,comment,2090431,2090431,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The problem here is that our hidden assumptions about the way things work don't match up to how they actually work.<p>It's because we've invented all these new technology concepts. Trying to make things easy on ourselves, we apply old analogies incorrectly to new situations. So if I ""own"" my email at GMail, somehow I feel put upon when somebody else comes along and reads it.<p>We have centuries of examples of social norms to call upon when discussing concrete things like vehicles, houses, or personal effects. So if some official comes in without notice and takes my personal papers, not only is it possibly legally wrong, but it's wrong for a good reason and everybody knows it's wrong simply from using their common sense.<p>We just naturally assume that these assumptions will hold true with new stuff, but they don't. Lawyer-types are defining things like electronically consuming a work of art or reading a book (in ebook format) in ways that don't match up to normality. The system is working as it has always worked -- government and special interests see an opportunity and they take it. Nature abhors a vacuum.<p>So we're either going to need to educate a lot of people on what the new rules are, change the rules, or stop participating in technology the same way we are doing now. Otherwise we're going to keep getting results we don't expect, and it's just going to tick folks off even more.<p>If you ask me, we're at the point where (at least in the U.S.) new constitutional amendments need to be considered regarding electronic anonymity, the relationship of computers to people (it's an extension of their mind, not a device to play things on), and the right to peaceably engage in international commerce as individuals without any government observation, taxation, or interference whatsoever.<p>I doubt that will happen, though.

They're similar languages, but not the same.  The grammer is close, but different.  The vocabulary is close, but different.<p>That being said, Land of Lisp is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in functional programming.  I would highly suggest giving it a whirl.  Learning Common Lisp will definitely help in learning Clojure.  But you really need to look at it as two distinct steps towards your goal of learning Clojure.<p>There is also a new Clojure book coming out at the end of the month called the Joy of Clojure, which I'm really excited about.  Currently the only two books out are Stewart Halloway's Programming Clojure, which is excellent. and Stuart Sierra's Practical Clojure, which is also very, very good.  They are both focussed on Clojure 1.0, however, so you'll miss out on some of the features brought by 1.1 and 1.2.  I own both, and can't recommend one over the other, though I might lean towards Practical Clojure purely for personal preference.",1294753478

I find that the best <i>value</i> is in the middle because the low-end is often poorly built or poorly engineered and does not last (too many corners cut, missing critical features, etc). The high-end gear usually well-built but includes fancy bells and whistles that I don't or won't use (with some exceptions). The best strategy that I use is to shoot for the mid-range product made by a manufacturer that offers high-end products. To create a mid-range product a manufacturer often has to gussy up a low end product or plain jane a high end product and the latter approach usually works better in the end.",1294751281

The niaspan information is here: <a href=""http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/niaspan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/niaspan.pdf</a><p>From what I've read, it's tough to overdose on niacin, especially the sustained-release forms. There are also apparently no deaths or long-term harmful results from overdoses either. However, they warn against using niaspan if you've already got liver or kidney problems or if you're taking statins too. I also read a warning that ER doctors can misinterpret the symptoms of a niacin overdose as an allergic reaction and give a treatment which does a lot more harm than the niacin would on its own.<p>I don't have any handy references about statins, but I've read that the side-effects are both more common and more dangerous; so much so that it's questionable whether or not they should be allowed on the market at all. They're also less effective than niaspan, I believe. The anecdotal evidence I have is that my mom was taking a statin for a while. It improved her cholesterol, but she also developed the bad heel pains that supposedly indicate a dangerous side-effect from the statin is occuring. When she stopped the statin, her heel pain went away. Since then her cholesterol hasn't been bad (though it did get somewhat worse after stopping the statin) but if it gets bad again I'm going to insist she try the niaspan instead.<p>For what it's worth, I don't work for the company that makes Niaspan. I'm just a very satisfied customer.",1273439749

The more of the first two you invest the less the latter two matter, talent because the more time you put in the less your initial (lack of) talent matters and luck because if you spend long enough at it some will find you.<p>So really you need persistence because if you've got that you won't have a problem keeping it up for (time). Persistence is easiest when you're motivated; when you're doing something you enjoy or that pays well enough.<p>You're unlikely to get paid until you've made something impressive and people ask you to do it for them. So what you need to do is find something you think is cool and do something about it, publicly, over and over again.<p>Get a hobby and write about it (blog) or think of an interest and set up a forum around it (e.g. alternatehistory.com for what-if). Things that are harder to do are more impressive and get more attention and link love, e.g. a relatively professionally shot and edited 20min video put up reliably every week on...

I'm not so much that way any more, but I do remember most of what I did to learn it.<p>It's definitely more about feelings than facts -- purely factual statements make a lot of people turn off to you -- but it's also about empathy. Not a new-age touchy-feely kind of empathy, but merely the ability to quickly understand the other person's habits, backgrounds, emotions, and personality. Think of it as learning to communicate in a different language, like speaking Russian to a Russian.<p>I studied some psychology, and although on the whole I think it was not terribly valuable, it did help me typecast people a little bit faster. For example, I tend to notice whether a person talks about what they <i>think</i>, or what they <i>feel</i>. If they say that they <i>feel like</i> x or y is right or wrong, then they're talking from an intuitive, emotional standpoint, and being all cerebral around them isn't going to get you very far.<p>There's also body language, the kinds of jokes a person tells, the sorts of phrases they use, and the dialect of language they use. I don't for example talk to boulderers the same way I'm talking now ... unless I want them to laugh at me. :-)<p>It started out as something I had to think about and study, but now it's intuitive and I don't think of it the same way anymore. It's just something I do.<p>I think this is a really valuable thing for other people to do; it would help communication between people a lot. There would be fewer misunderstandings.<p>Or, as my much-more-personable-and-outgoing girlfriend who again is reading over my shoulder says, ""Well, yeah, it teaches you how to listen.""<p>Guess I still have a lot more to learn.",1273439662

But you're absolutely right, this model is merely an approximation of perceptual color. You could instead build a complicated manifold representing perceptual color space, and define a criterion for a cloud of points in that manifold that resulted in pleasing colors, but it would be a lot more work than using the sphere, and you'd not gain that much, I don't think.<p>Re: how do we know? Well, mostly this system is based on the work of a number of thinkers, starting with Goethe and running through Munsell, Itten, Kandinsky, and a bunch of others, who spent a great deal of time putting colored squares next to each other. They discovered physiological effects of color, like simultaneous contrast. They attempted to learn about psychological effects of color. They admitted that, while some color combinations are attractive only to individuals, there were other sets that seem to have universal appeal. One of the things that those universal combinations had in common was that they centered themselves on the color wheel.<p>We know, more or less, by science. It is a largely empirical question (put some colors together, see if people like it). You can repeat the experiments yourself, if you like --- you asked 'how can we know'? Either take their word, or try it yourself.<p>And finally, in reply to the my use of the word 'emotional' --- if I were to say that colors whose center of balance is far from the center axis of the sphere are more surprising, and less comfortable, is that acceptable? I don't mean to say that red and green don't evoke different emotions than yellow and purple --- but they are both comfortable, obvious, familiar combinations; while, say, magenta and brown is less comfortable and takes more work to accept.",1273439030

It is uttered at appropriate ""levelling-up"" ceremonies by certified members of the cabal to customers seeking justification of their expenditures and validation of the status they have obtained. It's the appropriate boilerplate to deliver to customers at this point in their buying experience, but it doesn't say too much about the President's views.<p>If I read his speech on my iPad, does that make it a distraction, a diversion, or entertainment in the President's rubric? Am I being entertained or emancipated? It depends on who's doing the consumption and to what end.<p>Am I being overwhelmed with an unmanageable deluge of information? That's the argument the church made against the Luther Bible and the printing press. Information wise, we've always been capable of overwhelming ourselves by scanning a landscape, listening at the shore, or staring into the night's sky. Is reading a novel educational or entertaining? Does it depend on the nature of the novel? Is there a quantitative basis for that classification, like the number of neurons rewired by ingesting the novel? or the improved efficacy or performance of the system after ingestion?<p>Distractions, amusements and entertainments are the means by which our minds extend themselves to qualitative and quantitative changes in the information landscape: in information space, we evolve through play. Playing with information yields further information, knowledge, and maybe some wisdom. Sometimes play spills to the physical realm as artifacts or shared experience. Differentiating between ""education"" and ""entertainment"", ""entertainment"" and ""art"", or ranking things in terms of ""usefulness"" is post hoc analysis geared to reinforce the status quo, its information taxonomy, and its hierarchy of cultural value—an increasingly unmaintainable fiction, the acknowledgement of which would invalidate the blessing being conferred on this cohort of lemmings by the establishment through the President's words.",1273438920

As Hacker News grew beyond just a link bank, the community naturally turned inwards for consultation. Submissions “tagged” with Ask YC started popping up more and more and the response solicited were both interesting and honest.<p>So to help people get the most out of past discussions, we’ve compiled a list of Hacker News community threads. The Ask YC Archive features a bar graph for visualizing discussions over time based on points. We’ve also set up an RSS feed (<a href=""http://searchyc.com/askyc/rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/askyc/rss</a>) so you can keep track of new Ask YC threads in your favorite RSS reader. We hope these tools will allow our community to continually benefit from the wisdom of past discussions.",1203497758

119560,comment,119395,119395,0,0,st3fan,,,"I usually go with multiple local SMS providers. I've written a simple service that accepts a phone number and a message and then decides which gateway to use based on the country code. I've put a queue in between so that it is easy to quickly push out messages asynchronously. It's less than 1000 lines of Java. Today I would probably hack it together with Python and based on Amazon's Simple Queue service. In even less lines of code :-)",1203497502

People who are not savvy enough to use a RSS reader or RSS itself?<p>I love the minimalist design and the very functional UI -- good job.<p>You might want to shorten the subscribe URL so that it doesn't get wrapped in emails. Look at how short the you tube URL's are.<p>Good luck!",1203496412

I'd guess they are fairly entrepreneurial too. Feel free to ping me (myoung8@stanford.edu), I'm an entrepreneurial, unsnobbish designer and I can hold my own in Rails.",1203495806

Mobile carriers are very difficult to deal with, and almost universally have a policy of shutting off access first, and then it is your duty to try and figure out why it happened so you can navigate their bureaucracy in hopes of getting things restored.<p>I suggested email->sms for raju's question because he was looking for a solution for his ""small app"" that only ""potentially"" needed sms capabilities, so I assumed a low-volume transaction limit, for which email->sms is a cheap and easy solution.",1203494743

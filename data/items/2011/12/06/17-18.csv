The group started with just one member (me!) on the 11th January 2011 and now numbers 338 people. We're all practitioners in GPU ... all experts ... and that's the problem!<p>Few people in my group understand the economics and business aspects of GPU as an emerging technology. I think, as practitioners, we should understand the market and business we are in. We don't. Basic facts such as market size, growth rate, areas of application, the companies involved ... just aren't at our fingertips, and they should be.<p>Moreover, there is a huge amount of talent in the meetup group. Gosh, we have people with algorithms named after them! But I fear that much of that talent is underutilized.<p>For these reasons, I have organized a special meetup on ""The Business of GPUs"" that brings together practitioners, GPU companies, analysts, VCs, Angel Investors, and talent scouts -- just to see what happens by putting all these people together in one room. I think the results will be interesting! I hope you think so too as I would like to invite any HN member who can make it along (and if you can't come, that you will send a friend or colleague instead).<p>You can find out more details and register to attend (if you want to come) by following this link: http://www.meetup.com/HPC-GPU-Supercomputing-Group-of-New-York/events/36237782/<p>Incidentally, if you are unfamiliar with GPU technology it may help to know that massively parallel processing -- specifically using GPUs -- is finding much wider application in many areas: finance, media, scientific, biomedical, defense, 'big data', 'big compute', Cloud computing and many others. GPUs spectacularly speed up many applications -- by x10, x100 ... even x1000 in exceptional cases -- and by doing so they are changing the rules of the business game. GPUs are a great technology for both 'big data' and 'big compute'; two challenges that these days most often go together. We are entering a golden age of computational discovery in which we will be able to ask -- and get answers -- to questions we never thought possible; GPU technology is helping bring that golden age about.<p>All the best, Shep",1323193447

And that's what I'm addressing.<p>A few years ago, I believe, they explained that they generate these ginormous image caches where, IIRC, individual images are not distinct files.<p>My point is, regardless, if you can find the image (and its extent), and if the cache data are still write-able, then overlay a generated ""blank"" image onto the cached image, in place.  You still have some data leakage, in that the working URL confirms that there was an image having that URL.  But for most cases, I believe this would suffice.<p>I guess they'd also have to track down and overwrite the various thumbnail versions, but if their systems can already find these in the course of their normal work, this shouldn't be a problem.<p>As for overlaid tag data and whatnot, I'm not sure what to suggest.  At a first pass, I'd suggest just deleting (or ""offlining"" or whatever, given that FB apparently never really deletes anything) that data.  But I don't know what continuing dependencies that might break.)<p>EDIT:  I should add that I don't know whether/how such image caches are replicated.  And perpetuating such an overwrite against multiple replications might not be easy / something the existing design supports.<p>Nonetheless, I think it's something they <i>should</i> support.  At a minimum, when a user really wants to delete an image, then overwrite its segment of whatever image cache file with a ""blank"" equivalent.<p>Although... then you get into what may be legally required and/or prudent, from FB's perspective, to retain.<p>I'll stick to the simplistic user perspective:  When I say delete, I mean <i>delete</i>.",1323193395

The longest was for eight days. What I usually do now is a 24-hour fast: dinner, skip the following breakfast and lunch, and then dinner.<p>When I fasted for eight days, I dropped about ten pounds. On a 24-hour cycle of fasting, I will drop between 1 and 2 pounds a day depending on activity level.

This type of constant context switching is dreadful for productivity, and also stresses you out. Saying that, some startups actually do require 100 hour weeks.

""Availability"" sounds a little vague.<p>How do you signify if someone is available inside your app? A person icon and an illuminated coloured dot? A magnified version of that would convey the apps use very easily.<p>The icon makes me think of an ""updating"" symbol rather than location.<p>I had to read a fair bit until I had a general idea what it does.(I'm still not 100% sure what all the features are)<p>It would be instantly understandable if you had a screenshot of your app in use, where you logo is currently.<p>Displaying the viewpoint of a users would help a lot. Do I get a list of my colleagues and their current status? Is it messaging too? Can I look at other locations and see who's there?<p>It's an interesting app!",1323191087

Though we have the capacity to design a vehicle that the common man could fix himself on the weekend, we clearly don't have enough demand for one, and the regulatory market for pollution and safety might very well make it impossible.<p>The consequence of this is that knowledge of the mechanics of the complex system that is a modern vehicle is typically beyond any one person, and certainly well beyond the majority of its users.<p>Today there is leverage in far flung industries for the individual who has specialized knowledge of his field AND knowledge of how to apply software development to that field. But these opportunities will not last long. Any software that can increase profits in an industry will attract competition from other software developers. That software will be improved and refined by software specialists. It will (and has) evolved to a systemic complexity that equals the modern vehicle.<p>Software is a tool. The civil engineer who uses AutoCAD to design your road does not need to know how to code his own AutoCAD.",1323190977

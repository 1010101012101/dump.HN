Then it was launched in a disastrously bad way (closed beta? for a new communication tool meant to replace email?). Then as adoption started to build (but not quick enough to satisfy the political needs of the project), Wave was yanked after just a year.<p>Google Reader became a cornerstone of the web&#x27;s infrastructure, a public utility service that cost comparatively little, returned perhaps little other than good will, but ultimately served a purpose for millions of users. But that wasn&#x27;t enough for Google, so they yanked it.<p>In both cases, there was no real alternative path offered. Google just made an internal political decision to yank a project, and that&#x27;s that. The public never even got the option to try and support the project.<p>Based on the above and other less high-profile examples, I&#x27;m not willing to invest my time as an early adopter in a company that has the deep pockets to fund long-shot projects, but doesn&#x27;t have the balls to follow them through to their exciting conclusions.<p>Google Wave was a very exciting development with a lot of promise.

It&#x27;s just an optimization the standard allows compilers to do (eliding copies).<p>What C++11 provides is a new kind of type that says &quot;it is safe to steal the guts of this value&quot;. You can use this to overload a copy constructor or assignment operator to do &quot;moves&quot; instead of &quot;copies&quot;.  Because it is baked into the type system, it is guaranteed to happen when you expect it. While eliding a copy essentially has 0 cost, and the compiler will still prefer this over a move, moving a vector can have a very small cost (copying a few pointers), but it is still O(1) instead of O(n).",1383651211

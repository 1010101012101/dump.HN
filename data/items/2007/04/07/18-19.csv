10140,comment,10034,10034,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Ironically, I find the article's Typography to be completely underwhelming.  No attempt has been made to have the fonts visually represent the hierarchy of ideas being presented in the article, or to use the article as a showcase for how good great typography can be.  If this article is supposed to be doing that, it radically undercuts the article's position.",1175972146

10132,comment,10132,9498,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""That thought, however, led me to consider the idea of making order of operations always evaluate left-to-right""<p>Smalltalk does something similar.  In Smalltalk, any infix operator is just a binary message send, and they're parsed left to right.  So for example, 12 + 6 / 3 results in 6 instead of 14.  This result seems perfectly natural to most Smalltalkers, but it drives me nuts.<p>Personally, I think it's important to consider the audience when designing a programming language (or anything, really).  Operator precedence is totally illogical and adds lots of unnecessary complexity - but it's drilled into people's heads from elementary school onwards.  It's like Qwerty keyboards, American date formats, and English spelling.  In most cases, though, it's better to work with people's illogical expectations than to say ""No, you're wrong, here's a better way.""  Perhaps that's why Lisp never caught on.\n",1175970956

When the a layer of skin tissue is replaced by the body, it doesn't just disappear overnight.

10127,comment,10127,9770,0,0,DITSS,,,"When did Microsoft die?  That's simple.  It is the day that Bill Gates decided to leave Microsoft.  Not the day he left, but the day that privately, to himself, he decided to leave and devote his life to philanthropy.  Everything since then has been just a desperate attempt to grip the sand as it flows through their fingers.  The harder they sqeeze, the faster it flows through their fingers (<i>cough</i> Zune and PlaysForSure)\n",1175970048

10121,comment,10121,9770,0,0,gregshortdotcom,,,"Your observation that Macs and Linux machines outnumber computers running Windows is either humorously incorrect, or an outright lie. I work at a newspaper and the only people using Macs are the graphic designers. The rest of us, the vast majority of the company, use Windows.<p>You need look no further than any old web stats program to see who is online. (A quick look in Omniture at the stats for our newspaper web site shows that 74.4% of the operating systems are running Windows XP. Only 5.2% are using Macs. And just 3.9% are using other operating systems, i.e. Linux.) Or, for the less tech savvy, check the software shelves and see just how many programs support Macs.<p>It's really too bad. Your essay is otherwise very well written. It's just not founded in fact.",1175969463

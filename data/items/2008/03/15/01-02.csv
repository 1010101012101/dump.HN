When they have that opportunity, says Berk, the results are clear: Self-regulation improves.""",1205546278

And finding things to blame this on, like toys.<p>I don't think the issue was <i>self</i>-discipline because the example of how they studied it was about whether the children would stand still when someone else told them to.",1205545930

The other key advantage we have is that as the web's traffic is more international and as we add advertisers from different countries we can serve Ip targeted ads on the same publishers and be extremely local at the same time.<p>We have a global and pretty ambitious vision - its how hotjobs started, we're aiming to be even bigger in this phase of the web.",1205545433

Like Windows, only worse.<p>As for starting with MySQL, it does reflect the actual SQL side better, but it's another thing to install and have startup whenever you boot your computer.

137295,comment,137080,137281,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"PG is right - we'll be doing much more.<p>You can give far more than $0.10. That is just the default. It is really simple to give up to $10, and we might raise or remove that limit.<p>Also, we earn interest on money in our system. That makes the earnings closer to 6%. But we don't take a cut per tip, only on cash-out. This means that if A tips B who then tips C, each of those tips is overhead free. If C cashes out, we take a cut. The potential for a zero overhead transaction system is huge.",1205543417

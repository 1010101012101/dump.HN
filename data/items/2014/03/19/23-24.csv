7432791,comment,7432427,7432655,1,0,aristus,,,"If the system were fully meritocratic, you&#x27;d expect a lot more females in the industry, for one. Unless you suppose that females of all races are objectively less capable in some way. But then you&#x27;d have to explain why there are so many females being successful in other hard sciences like biology.<p>The fact is that many people aren&#x27;t given early access and encouragement to technology, and the ones that do experience constant pressure and put-downs. Sometimes it&#x27;s obvious, sometimes not. I&#x27;ve done hundreds of interviews and dozens of interview trainings, and have personally observed lots of silly behavior, from treating women more harshly than men, to dismissing a candidate because their family name implied a background of poverty.<p>A &quot;safe&quot; example to think about: it&#x27;s very common to rubbish people who went to this university or that one instead of yours, which is obviously the best. You can write that off as good-natured play, but consider that I&#x27;ve had to build a career in tech without a degree. It&#x27;s only by the slimmest chain of coincidences that I was able to even get the opportunity to be seen and evaluated. The &quot;meritocratic&quot; system simply doesn&#x27;t <i>believe</i> that anyone without the nous to afford college is worth even noticing.<p>The hiring manager at the end of that food chain is often unaware of all that. He (and it&#x27;s usually a &quot;he&quot;) passes over resumes and chuckles at their university choices, then picks &quot;the good ones&quot; to jump through hoops and from there picks &quot;the best&quot;. To him, that&#x27;s meritocracy.",1395273547

I&#x27;ve never worked in a frat house type startup, but rather ones with a great mixture of high end talent. So I concede I might be only experiencing an outlier.<p>Asians in America put a much higher priority on education than other races, at least based on college graduation statistics. If you look at marriages, the pairings which have the highest rate of possessing a college degree are Asian/Asian, White/Asian, and Asian/White. Most engineering jobs require a degree, so is it really a surprise that Asian&#x27;s have higher representation in tech than perhaps other races?<p>I chose to do coding and design because it was something I enjoyed. Growing up, I did it on my own time despite the fact that it wasn&#x27;t a particularly socially attractive endeavor especially compared to sports.

For example, a company I worked for in college was a small manufacturer and were trying and failing to keep track of raw material inventory via Quickbooks. On one hand, the inventory needs to be quantified in a dollar amount in quickbooks, but more importantly, they need to be able to use real inventory management functions. Ideally, they would (and probably could&#x27;ve) bought some package just for tracking inventory in and out, but also had an ODBC connection for Quickbooks to see how much the current inventory is worth.<p>Warehouse Management Systems are similar. Lots of providers at varying levels of cost and complexity, but I haven&#x27;t seen to many that I can jump into an app store and buy. Of course, the real complexity is that every business has wildly different needs, and even two businesses in the same space will manage processes completely differently. Mods and customization tends to be a big deal. Also, consultants are constantly fighting to be the middleman in between the software providers and the end customers.<p>These are just a couple reasons I think it can be tough to break into the markets that Oracle, SAP, etc are in.<p>Also, I think there&#x27;s a good reason that there are tons of tables and menus in enterprise software. There is a ton of structured data there, so it ends up being the easiest way to show it. Simplifying features and interfaces is a tough sell, because as soon as you think you have things down to a minimum set of &#x27;what really needs to be there&#x27;, your customer will say, &quot;oh, no. We REALLY need to be able to do x,y,z&quot;. Okay, so those make the cut, too.

An RSA key of <i>length</i> 4096b does not provide you with a security level of 4096b. That is, you don&#x27;t have to straight-up guess the keys, you work at it via factorisation.<p>The issue is arising from the fact that entopy and key length are both commonly measured in bits. The entropy of an RSA key is much lower than the key length. 256b of entropy seems to be more than reasonable at first glance.<p>Normally, I would not defend openSSL, but I will do so here, having not even looked at the responsible code (nor has the submitter of this bug), and not even looked at the mailing list link.<p>Seriously, do not panic, let the cryptographers look at this and decide if it&#x27;s really an issue. It&#x27;s probably good that they&#x27;re getting 256b of entropy from urandom, it&#x27;s likely that they&#x27;re seeding a CSPRNG for prime generation & testing.<p>I would wager some small sum on this being closed by the end of the week, and us looking back on this and shaking our heads at the uninformed knee-jerk reaction of people in here:<p>&quot;If I ask for a 4096-bit key, I should get one, or an error message.

Not saying it&#x27;s a bad thing that you have reached this point and haven&#x27;t figured &quot;the answer&quot; yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure &quot;the answer&quot; is probably somewhere inside of you.<p>I have not reached that point.. yet (I hope I will, rather sooner than later), but supposing I did reached that point, let&#x27;s say, yesterday, oh boy, there are soooo many things that I would love to be doing.<p>For instance, after maybe going on a shopping spree for all those things that I&#x27;ve always wanted (truly not that many or that extravagant), for example setting up a very nice NAS + Media Center for my house, getting a swimming pool maybe, a laptop upgrade (mine is past 7 years of daily use...) and maybe stuff for my girlfriend/wife, I would then spend a few months travelling (not the whole world mind you, maybe 4-5 2-month trips or so). But aside from inane things and materialistic desires...<p>I would love to do a few things (besides spending time with family/friends) that would make up my &quot;daily life&quot;, meaning I would like to do this as a form of retirement.<p>- Study without worrying if I&#x27;m going to be able to maintain the scholarship for example. Just get a Physics degree and maybe a chemistry one.\n- Put an animal shelter and then replicate if successful, i.e. put a LOT of shelters throughout my country.\n- My most desired idea: To develop what I call an &quot;Idea Lab&quot;, which is something I&#x27;m sure a lot of other people have thought of. What about using my bottomless bucket of money to fund really neat and cool ideas that a lot of normal folks have, and having a staff of engineers, mathematicians, and in general all types of scientists and makers, to make these ideas come to life. Ideas that should help other people like water purification tools/processes, clean energy generation, etc.<p>I think those are the 3 things that would very easily consume my life if I had no need for money. I would love for example to donate to my college a building or two, computers, maybe pay lecture for really cool guys to inspire students, etc.<p>In short, I do actually dream on becoming wealthy enough not to care about my survival so I could help others around me. First family and friends and then my immediate community. And finally, if I actually become like ultra-rich, I would just DIE to put my own space company and help, even if a tiny bit, to get humanity out of this planet and unto the stars. In that regard I think something like Carmack&#x27;s Armadillo Aerospace would absolutely rock!<p>But of course, like someone else mentioned before, that&#x27;s what I say I will do in my hypothetically perfect world. But I like to think that I won&#x27;t deviate much from the general idea.... of course only time will tell.<p>PS: Now that I think of it, I would certainly look at putting libraries around my hometown for example. Real libraries (like with books and maybe even classrooms or something). What about putting some type of &quot;online university&quot;, that&#x27;s basically a building with the necessary tools to let people study coursers from Coursera and the like? and maybe even have &quot;TA&#x27;s&quot; that would help you out if you got stuck. I think that could go a long way to help people bootstrap themselves out of poverty, like one other poster commented before. So no giving away free money, but the opportunity to make something for yourself. Which coming in from a third world country, let me tell you how satisfactory it is to see someone that had everything against them, succeed and be a happy person.<p>...and of course I would like a pony that shits rainbows... but like my dad likes to say &quot;the cool thing about imagination is that it&#x27;s free, so why dream small?&quot;",1395270116

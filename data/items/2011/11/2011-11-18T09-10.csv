I have yet to receive a reply, but it's pretty important to eliminate a programming error from this.<p>For example, there were small errors in the Met Office's climate change software that I detected.  The scientific papers were correct, but the translation into code was not.  This could have happened here and it would be better if they released the code.<p><a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2010/02/something-odd-in-crutem3-station-errors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2010/02/something-odd-in-crutem3-station...</a>",1321610349

How's the streaming content that Apple provides?""</i><p>I'll bite. I really don't like the Prime free Videos thing. It's not the lack of selection (though that is an issue), it's that there is <i>zero</i> discoverability.<p>Amazon's concept of ""recommendations"" is quaint and still entirely obsessed with the concept of a physical product, and fails dramatically when put alongside modern recommendation engines like Netflix, or any number of smaller startups that deliver better content recommendations. Netflix's content selection isn't terribly awesome either, but it doesn't <i>feel</i> lacking because the system does such a fine job of finding you something to watch.<p>And it's not that Amazon <i>tries</i> to build out a good discoverability system,and it just isn't any good. It simply <i>doesn't have one</i>. When you drop into the Video Store, almost none of the things it shows you are meant to be relevant to you. We see global bestsellers. We see new releases. We see nothing relevant to the user, and that's a pretty big problem for a device whose mission is to help customers discover content and buy it.<p>The same applies to the MP3 Store. Where Apple has Genius, Spotify/Rdio have social features and tastemaker-based recommendations... the Music Store on the Fire has... nothing.<p>I'm really disappointed with mine. The out of box experience is <i>so good</i>. You pull it out of the box and power it on, it's <i>already</i> registered to your Amazon account. You're led through a simple setup process as good as iPad with iOS5. You even get these cute chalk-mark-scribbles tutorial overlays when you first land on the home screen.<p>And then you drop off a damn cliff, and 20 minutes later you realize the device is pretty vacuous. About the only part of the entire device where I don't have serious issues is the e-reader, thank God.",1321609899

3251155,comment,3250825,3251014,3,0,tzs,,,"Two more things.<p>1. If you want to take weight off and keep it off, forget most ""diets"". Most people think of a ""diet"" as a temporary change--and when they reach whatever their goal is they go off the diet. And then the weight starts coming back.<p>You are looking for a permanent change. If you are 300 pounds, say, and you want to be 200, you should be eating like a 200 point person plus enough extra so that your weight loss will not be too fast--a pound or two a week tops, unless your doctor tells you that you need to get the weight off faster.<p>The overall trajectory you are aiming for is a smooth decrease over time to your target weight.<p>2. Because you should be thinking long term, not meal to meal or day to day, you can simplify much of your calorie counting (if you need calorie counting) by working in bulk, at least if you aren't sharing a food supply with someone.<p>For instance, suppose you have determined that 2000 calories a day is right for healthy weight loss at your current weight and exercise level. 2000 calories a day is 14000 calories a week, or approximately 61000 calories a month.<p>If you set your goal as 61000 calories a month, rather than 2000 a day, you don't have to bother with keeping track of portions. When you buy a box of cereal that says it contains 12 servings of 150 calories each, you don't need to be careful to actually eat it over 12 breakfasts, or break out the scale and weigh it out whenever you eat it--you just record it as 1800 calories the day you buy it (or the day you open it--whichever convention you like better).",1321607395

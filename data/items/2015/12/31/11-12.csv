However, I think regexes got a bad reputation just because of the way people use them. In essence they are a pretty reliable way of parsing because the parsing engine is well tested. But the expression should be kept as simple as possible and developer should avoid using any nonstandard / nonexplicit extensions. I even avoid using \w because, well, what IS a word character? I am sure it is defined somewhere... but I&#x27;ll always use explicit form (like &quot;[a-zA-Z]&quot; when I want ASCII chars) instead.<p>Anyway, if you use the form as used in the regex puzzle [0], you&#x27;ll be fine.

Prevention of dysfunction has been a principle of particular merit, the &quot;gold standard&quot;.  That is, preservation of healthy status, is worth far more than mitigating damage after it occurs.<p>In the health arena, immunization is a great example.  Preventing a disease reduces suffering and costs of care by orders of magnitude.  The few bad reactions, even the cost of rare fatal outcomes pale in comparison to the upside benefit.  (I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s a <i>good</i> year for flu vaccine, I got my flu shot last month. If it lets me avoid <i>having</i> the flu that&#x27;s very beneficial to me.)<p>As Blaze convincingly remarks the value of preventing crime is enormous in terms of the benefit that it yields.  In my world, one that Blaze talks about, breaches of confidential health records are matters of great concern for the tremendous negative impact caused.<p>From what&#x27;s reported (and comments from people I know in the EHR industry), those systems are <i>vulnerable</i> to intrusions.  If secure non-backdoored encryption adds even a shallow layer of protection, that would give a worthy benefit.<p>Blaze implies even good encryption models are no guarantee that will solve the problems.  Often said here on HN, &quot;security is hard, very hard&quot; to get right.  But to the extent its application prevents criminals from actually committing crimes it will far outweigh to damage done by criminals that aren&#x27;t caught because they could keep their destructive activity secret.<p>I could add quite a long riff on the near impossibility of humans keeping secrets, anyway it seems not in our nature to be good at it.

Not only does its uppercase mapping expand in length, but its default case-pairings are asymmetrical. The default case mapping operations follow standard German orthography, which uses the string “SS” as the regular uppercase mapping for U+00DF ß latin small letter sharp s. In contrast, the alternate, single character uppercase form, U+1E9E latin capital letter sharp s, is intended for typographical representations of signage and uppercase titles, and in other environments where users require the sharp s to be preserved in uppercase. Overall, such usage is uncommon. Thus, when using the default Unicode casing operations, capital sharp s will lowercase to small sharp s, but not vice versa: small sharp s uppercases to “SS”, as shown in Figure 5-16. A tailored casing operation is needed in circumstances requiring small sharp s to uppercase to capital sharp s.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch05.pdf#G21180"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch05.pdf#G21180</a>",1451561663

If you are given options to buy privately-held common stock in lieu of compensation, you must demand transferability.

CASHLESS EXERCISABILITY. Always ask for cashless exercisability. In the public market, if you ask your broker to &quot;cashlessly exercise&quot; in-the-money options, here is what happens. First, your broker lends you the money to exercise the options. Then, the broker sells some of the resulting stock.

(Fractions of shares are usually lopped off in these calculations.)<p>Plus: you got shares without putting up capital. Minus: you lost the upside (and downside) on ninety-one shares.

Most of the money is currently going in wars we cant win or end, military junk and welfare. If I had a choice I would pay government to run a police force and courts but not for these things.<p>US gov already gets sufficient tax money to run its basic business. I would appreciate if the cut their spending instead of stealing money from me and Apple.",1451559880

What I actually said was:<p>> But let&#x27;s not pretend that &quot;it just works, right out of the box!&quot;(TM) <i>every</i> <i>time</i>. [Emphasis added]<p>Of course Linux often works. Perhaps even most times. A couple of weeks ago I reinstalled my laptop, switching from Ubuntu to elementaryOS. Took me about two hours (not counting most of the backups). On Windows, I would have needed two days. I have done an OS install dozens of times, with various versions of Windows and various Linux distros. And I find that Linux is often easier than Windows, because you can install all the software from one official repository instead of hunting through the download pages of a dozen vendors. BUT, and here comes the big but - that still doesn&#x27;t meant that it <i>always</i> works smoothly. (Not that Windows always works smoothly, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. We&#x27;re talking about Linux&#x27; problems right now.) To claim that there are never problems is simply not true.<p>About shell commands: of course Windows has those. But when do you ever really have to use them? (If you are a sysadmin, perhaps, but again, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. We are just considering &quot;normal&quot; users.) Everything that needs to be done can be done graphically. The various Linux DEs have made a lot of progress in that area in the past few years, but don&#x27;t kid yourself. There&#x27;s still a lot you can&#x27;t do with a GUI.<p>And on a final (not quite serious) note:<p>> You have to compare apples to apples.<p>If I did that, I would never get away from Mac OS X, would I? :D",1451559878

When I have negotiated with startups I have paid for legal advice to help me figure out what language I needed in the option agreement (for example, a pinterest-style clause that prevents me from having to exercise within 3 months of leaving) and negotiated for the terms I felt were important.  Just because the agreement is written to give you ISOs doesn&#x27;t mean they will qualify for ISO tax treatment when you eventually exercise, so it is better to let you give up ISO treatment and convert to NSOs in order to avoid having to effectively forfeit vested options upon departure from the firm or face massive tax consequences. The pinterest-style structure should be standard.",1451559827

The company can issue new shares at any time leading to dilution. Also at some future liquidity event (acquisition, IPO), a significant number of new shares can be issued leading to more dilution.<p>So yes, options are somewhat of a lottery ticket with ever changing odds. If the company does extraordinarily well, you will do well also. If you truly believe the company has a very good chance at financial success, you should stay irrespective of the number of options. If you are making a significant contribution to that success, a rational company will want to reward you and incent you to stay with more options. If both those things are not true, it is best to seek your fortune elsewhere.",1451559689

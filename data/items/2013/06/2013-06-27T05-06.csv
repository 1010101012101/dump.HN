When I hear a song that I love, I have to own it. If I hear something on Spotify I&#x27;m off to the iTunes store to buy it. If I hear it in a shop or at a party, I Shazam it and I&#x27;m off to the iTunes store. If it&#x27;s not on the iTunes store, I look for a store that has it. If it&#x27;s not available on any store (this happens frequently - I listen to a lot of underground music) I check on Soundcloud. If it&#x27;s not on Soundcloud then I&#x27;m off to Youtube and favorite it so that I can look for it again at a later date.<p>My music collection used to be 100% pirated, but when I lost my collection (and backups!) I realised how much good music meant to me. It&#x27;s worth more than most of my possessions. The issue for many is perceived value - I cannot fathom how someone would happily pay for a beer or some other quick buzz but not for a song that will bring them joy for the rest of their lives.",1372312517

Basically, kill blocks. This is inferior to Objective-C itself structure-wise.<p>Second, and most importantly, this bug is not something that jumps out at you. It only causes crashes in some small % of runs. So, the result is your apps look fine, you are writing idiomatic ruby, but once you release to production, you start getting crash reports because you closed over a local variable that ends up being released. This is the kiss of death for production apps: un-reproducible bugs due to magic in the compiler not working as expected.<p>In other words, even if you know about the bug, and even if you understand the workaround, if you write code naturally, you are going to introduce crashing bugs that are not reproducible that affect some small but measurable percentage of your users.

It may take off with others, but she can make the industry be less about churning fashion and making things more durable (quality-wise and trend-wise).

I am a recent graduate from community college (AS in CS and Computer Networking). I have been programming since the age of 15 - since my friends on IRC got me interested in IRC server architectures, botnets and abusing raw sockets. I have worked as a lead documentation editor and a system administrator (and enjoyed it!). I have always taken pride in my ability to learn independently but I have also disciplined myself to get the &#x27;school experience&#x27; and a formal education.  I went to school for software engineering (my community college taught SE while calling it CS). I plan to continue my education toward a Masters in CS but I am focusing on employment right now. I am passionate about backend technologies and network programming. I love learning and consuming protocols but I am growing to become a frontend developer.  I am looking for somewhere to get my feet... more wet. I am looking for experience and networking opportunities. I would be happy to even move into a position where I&#x27;m maintaining something (again, to gain experience). I have been through the introductory tutorials for Angular, Backbone, Ember, Meteor, and React. I feel capable but not wise about how to make use of them. I consider myself not an expert but someone who has a good depth of knowledge covering a broad area. I feel like this aids me when figuring out a tough problem, as I am willing to look outside my comfort zone to find a solution.<p>Respectfully, I would work for any company but Amazon.<p>(PS: I can be reached on Freenode as &#x27;Sleepy_Coder&#x27; - but email is preferred for an introduction)",1449032233

Devoting his wealth to philanthropy at such an young age will not only benefit people from around the world for decades to come, it will also set an example for everyone in his generation who has the means to give.  The traditional approach to giving – leaving it to old age or death – is falling by the wayside, as it should.  Mark’s decision shows that when it comes to philanthropy, 30 is the new 70.  I share many of Mark’s philanthropic interests, especially around education and innovation, and his focus on long-term ideas and research will help create economic opportunities and promote social equality for generations to come.

The high-profile investors tend to want to shutter the company completely or to downsize immensely. Basically gut, maximize profits for a quarter or two, and sell.<p>Biggest example is probably Carl Icahn. He&#x27;s well known in the tech world for trying to do these types of things to Apple, Netflix, and Dell.

So wrong. Anyone who has worked with large government or private sector document management knows the problems here.<p>No one (except really young organizations) has the centralized infrastructure in place to make this easy. They&#x27;re looking at huge amounts of legacy systems, decades worth of warehouses filled with paper records, millions of new e-mails created daily. None of these systems are effectively integrated.<p>The company I work for has one of only a handful of FOIA systems being shopped to the government right now, and after seeing the hurdles going on here I can tell you first hand that these backlogs aren&#x27;t because people are dragging their feet. We&#x27;ve been doing ECM stuff for 30 years now, and whenever we come into an organization like this it takes us ages just to help them sort out how to connect this stuff together.<p>But it&#x27;s totally worth it. Every organization so far that has managed the move to an electronic FOIA system, despite the slight uptick in requests, has taken a huge bite out of their FOIA backlog just because electronic centralized systems make the FOIA response process so much easier.<p>Again, congrats to the guys over there.

The lower the power and space efficiency of the interconnect, the larger the incentive is to put ASIC-style interconnected gates into little islands in the FPGA fabric - hence the various complex tiles like MACs that you mention.<p>When nonvolatile nanoscale memory becomes more widespread (the demand driven by SSDs, but FPGAs get to benefit), the additional interconnect power costs get close to zero, and when things get so small that nanowires are much smaller than the smallest gate, the space requirements start being negligable as well.<p>At that point there&#x27;s no real advantage to having those complex tiles, because the equivalent configured FPGA circuit is just as efficient, so you might as well take advantage of the flexiblity of a completely uniform fabric.<p>The point of view taken in the paper I linked above is that even LUTs are an uneccessary optimization at that point.<p>I&#x27;m not saying all of this is an inevitability - but it&#x27;s my bet.",1449029938

Ian Stewart has written a bunch awesome books about math, and he writes in a classic 20th Century style of science/math popularizer, believing that there is a &quot;general&quot; public out there that might find math interesting. More about him here:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)</a><p>From the essay itself, this part struck me:<p>&quot;What I called the transitional generation, those born around 1920, entered the universities, often late in their careers and without Ph.D.s. The Irving Howes and Daniel Bells became professors but retained their allegiance to a world of readable essays and small periodicals. The next generation — my generation — came of age in the universities and never left them. The world became specialized journals, monographs, and grant applications. This generation wrote for colleagues. If they were intellectuals, they no longer were &quot;public&quot; intellectuals; rather, they were academic or professional intellectuals oriented toward one another and microfields. In the 1880s, political science could claim one journal; now more than 40 populate the discipline. The American Political Science Association recognizes more than 30 subfields. The larger culture, I believe, suffers when intellectuals turn inward.&quot;<p>This is very much what Ian Stewart has lamented about the field of math. In one of his books (I think &quot;Letters to a Young Mathematician&quot;) he mentions that there are now a vast multitude of journals that publish work about math, but that the field now consists of narrow specialists who are unable to understand each others work.<p>Considering that the whole field of science depends on math, and progress in science often depends on progress in math, the breakdown in math is especially worrisome.<p>I have the impression that what is needed is more people, within each field, who are willing to play the role of cross - pollinator. These people would not be &quot;popularizers&quot; in the old sense, since they would not be reaching out to the &quot;general&quot; public, but they would be reaching out to various specialities, and trying to unlock the knowledge in each sub-field. Sadly, there are not many incentives for this. I have friends who work in academia, and they would love to see more cross-pollination of ideas, but there is no reward to them for doing so, and there are large penalties if they fail to make progress in their narrow speciality.",1449029576

9229970,comment,9229519,9229936,0,0,mikeash,,,"I would say &quot;all of the above.&quot;<p>LEO do routinely believe that people they investigate must be guilty. They don&#x27;t investigate at random, but rather are prompted by some evidence of criminal behavior. That certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that you must be guilty if they investigate you, but it sets <i>them</i> up to <i>believe</i> you are.<p>The system is set up with compartments so nobody sees the full consequences of anything and this sort of misbehavior is encouraged. If you send somebody to jail, they disappear from your life the moment the verdict is reached and you have no reason to dwell on the harm you&#x27;ve caused them. (And if you do, you probably think it&#x27;s a good thing, because you think they&#x27;re a criminal!) And you probably get a commendation for putting a bad guy away.<p>Bad behavior does get reported disproportionately. Most cops are good cops. For everyone like this, there are ten cops who find a lost cellphone and personally deliver it back to the owner, as happened to a neighbor of mine a few months ago. That doesn&#x27;t make the news. Although that doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be a concern for the majority of us. Even a small risk of being falsely imprisoned is important, and there&#x27;s no harm in taking the &quot;SHUT UP&quot; route with a good cop.<p>Finally, I would be wary of assuming that malicious intent is no higher than among the general population. Bad people tend to seek power over others, and what better way to wield such power than to do so <i>legally</i> as a member of the police? No doubt, the legitimate &quot;protect and serve&quot; folks still greatly outnumber the bad guys, but I would bet they&#x27;re more concentrated.",1426733355

9229954,comment,9225683,9229874,0,0,graycat,,,"> I have no idea what you are saying.<p>Sorry not to be clear.<p>My view of efforts in grades 8-12 or so\nto have students do well in math competitions,\ne.g., the Math Olympiad, is that those \nefforts are not promising\nfor helping those students do well\nwith math or anything else later in life.\nInstead, mostly the efforts are just wasteful\nfor all concerned.<p>The main reason for the waste is that the\npeople, usually the high school math teachers,\nrunning the programs don&#x27;t know enough\nmath to give good direction to the students\nthat might want to do especially well in math,\nwell enough that 30 years later we would\ncommonly see significant positive effects\nfrom that direction and the resulting\nefforts of the students.<p>So, the direction that is commonly given\nis to have the students study\nrelatively useless material,\nsay, recreational math, some \npuzzle problems, every tricky\nthing they can see in Pascal&#x27;s\ntriangle (the binomial coefficients,\nthat is, the coefficients of\n(x + y)^n with one row for each \nvalue of positive integer n), and there are a lot\nof such tricky things.<p>But, right,\nthe binomial coefficients have some\nnice properties, some of which are\ngood to know, and an early volume\nof D. Knuth&#x27;s <i>The Art of Computer\nProgramming</i> has some good coverage.\nBut, net, mostly to heck with the\ntriangle and, if insist, then read\nthe relevant sections of Knuth --\nbut even there Knuth has a good reason\nfor presenting that material, and what&#x27;s\nimportant is the applications Knuth makes,\nso, really, just read on in Knuth.<p>So, instead, students who do want to\ndo better in math, and I did,\nshould just proceed along the usual\ntopics, texts, etc. for a ugrad math \nmajor.  In particular, as a first goal,\nASAP get a\ngood college calculus text, get \nthe basic prerequisites, and dig in.<p>By the way, the time I looked\nat the AP calculus materials\nI didn&#x27;t like them and\nconcluded that the people\nwho wrote the materials\ndidn&#x27;t understand calculus\nvery well.  Instead, just get\na good college calculus text.<p>For the rest I mentioned, about have\nto have a relatively applied\nugrad math major to\nunderstand:  So, would need to know\nsome linear programming, network flows,\noptimization, integer programming,\nsomething about the question of P versus\nNP, and more.<p>For Lagrangian relaxation,\nthat&#x27;s a bit tricky and specialized\nand not commonly well known even among\ncollege math profs.  I did give an\noutline in<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311</a><p>but it&#x27;s not really easy reading.\nBut it&#x27;s a cute topic with some\na good intuitive views, a bit\namazing in some ways,\nand at times shockingly powerful.<p>E.g., the guy who first did the\n<i>many worlds</i> interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, a Ph.D.\nphysics student\nof J. Wheeler at Princeton,\nan expert in relativity theory,\nwas H. Everett, and at one time\nhe had a nice applied math \nshop near DC doing resource\nallocation for the US DoD\nusing a first, simple version\nof Lagrangian relaxation.\nWhat I outlined in<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311</a><p>is more general and powerful\nand makes some cute use of\nsome convexity -- that there is\nconvexity there is also surprising\nbut true and powerful and, with\nthe right setup, easy to prove.",1426733068

9229942,comment,9228947,9228947,0,0,YZF,,,"I live in greater Vancouver and I take public transport almost every day.  I am almost certainly going to vote NO.<p>Translink just threw $200M down the drain on the Compass program ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Card_%28TransLink%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Card_%28TransLink%29</a> ).  If/when this ever comes into effect it will increase my transit costs (vs. the 10 book tickets I can buy now).  It will almost certainly increase my travel time due to lineups.  My kids who home school will not be able to get a student&#x27;s fare any more.  Causal riders will avoid public transport because they need to give Translink $12 just for the privilege of a single bus ride (card + minimum &quot;fill&quot;). It will almost certainly increase Translink&#x27;s expenses in maintaining this system.  I&#x27;m not happy with their choices.<p>Public transport in greater Vancouver sucks big time (perhaps except within the city proper.)  I used to have a commute of 25 minutes to work by car/motorcycle.  Taking public transport would have made that over 2 hours.  Most transport lines go from somewhere to downtown.  If you need to go &quot;across&quot; and are outside the center good luck.  If I miss my &quot;express&quot; bus in the morning (because it came 10 minutes early, which happens) then I have to walk 1km and wait 20 minutes for the slow bus that takes 20 minutes longer.  If I come early, well, the bus can also be 10 minutes late...  I understand they have a larger/less densely populated area to cover but they do not seem to be creative enough in doing that.  The SkyTrain is just about the most expensive way of doing transport per km.  I&#x27;m not sure other options were considered (e.g. there are de-comissioned train tracks running through Vancouver).  Public transport is also quite expensive compared to anywhere else I&#x27;ve taken public transport.  Dropping prices would help increase ridership which might help fix some of the other issues.<p>Fares that were raised when energy prices came up didn&#x27;t come down once energy prices declined.  This plan itself was made at a time when energy prices were higher and it seems they&#x27;re not going back to the same levels any time soon.  At the same time, Vancouver is pretty much the most expensive place in North America to get gas.  Supposedly that tax money should have gone towards improving public transport.<p>Once taxes are increased that money can go anywhere.  There&#x27;s no &quot;contract&quot;.  There&#x27;s no accountability.  There are also a lot of improvements that could be made without getting into big ticket items.  Optimizing the existing system towards public transport.  I view the tax increase as throwing good money after bad money something I try not do to in my personal finance and I don&#x27;t want the province to engage in this in their finance.",1426732895

I realize that processes, bureaucracy and generally abstraction can allow people to do less than desirable behaviours, but I can&#x27;t quite figure out which abstraction that would encourage people to do things like that (note: with the term &quot;abstraction&quot;, I meant that by using incentives or measuring the wrong intermediate metrics, we&#x27;ve created a wrong set of objectives, which might be completely misaligned with the actual goal we&#x27;re trying to achieve).<p>Laws are complex set of statements, which naturally will have more accidentally complexity as they&#x27;re developed, a phenomenon that hackers are extremely familiar with. That&#x27;s something to be expected. On the other hand, human, abusing the accidental complexity of law, is not ideal - as anything else, there should be place and time for trickery, but not the SOP.<p>That said, what&#x27;s the rationale for the behaviour of law enforcement officer in pursuing various type of trap-y actions?<p>- Do LEO routinely believes that everyone they investigate to be committing the crime. Do we have a good priori of P(criminal | under investigation) that would support this?<p>- Did we actually manage to create a powerful enough abstractions that let actors within the system to, well, behave psychopathically (ie. this button should be pushed because I&#x27;m supposed to do that, I don&#x27;t really know what happen behind it)?<p>- Trickery are generally being reported out of proportion, and should not be a general concern for the the majority of us.<p>- Malicious intention -- I will assume this percentage to be not higher than those from a general population.",1426732751

While I agree that transit functions very well in the core part of the city, lack of rapid transit out to the University is a conspicuous weakness -- the 15-km commute from East Van takes over an hour by transit. With a tram or SkyTrain line it could be a third of that. Also, much of Surrey (whose population will exceed Vancouver&#x27;s within a decade) is very far from any SkyTrain station. To be fair, Burnaby and New West at least are well-served by fast transit.<p>I think Toronto&#x27;s Go Train serves commuters better than anything in Vancouver. Montreal has a similar light-rail system which I&#x27;ve used a few times.<p>In general, though, I agree with you.

Professional and courteous drivers, usually an impeccably maintained black Mercedes-Benzes, and a digital readout of the current fare on the rear-view mirror. And this was 7 years ago. Upon landing in Atlanta, I&#x27;d regularly step into a smelly, old van--with a driver who spoke little English and zero knowledge of the city, requiring GPS entry before departing--only to careen haphazardly down the highway. The contrast was rather stark.<p>As a driving enthusiast, driving in German was a pleasure (minus the traffic). Being able to cruise at 140 mph on unrestricted sections en route to Darmstadt, and feel safe doing so, was wonderful. Then again, obtaining a driver&#x27;s license in Germany is substantially more difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Vehicle maintenance requirements are likewise more stringent (e.g. mandatory winter tires). Given the different driving environment, this ruling is not surprising in light of Uber&#x27;s lackadaisical approach (I say that as a fan of Uber&#x27;s service in the US, not their behavior).<p>Whereas in much of the US, you can cruise around a parking lot with an instructor, and walk away with a drivers license.

Most cars sit unused for 22 hours a day, and there are enormous economies to be gained from improved utilization if cars are a shareable asset, especially with the labor taken out of the equation (as compared to current Uber), and I think the shift may well happen on its own, at least in part and in some places. And to be clear, it&#x27;s not an all-or-nothing proposition; replacing some drivers still potentially improves everyone&#x27;s safety.<p>As for the second bit: if you think my first stat is disingenuous, pay attention to my second, which you cut off halfway through.

But he would have a lot.<p>Now, some of the other 4 might have had children, but they might have dies young, or in turn not have had any descendants whose genetic line is still around.<p>Of course, the same would have happened to women, so maybe out of 15 men and 15 women, 5 women and 1 man have genes that are still around.<p>Also note that, unless I misunderstand, this only applies to single gendered lineage. That is there must be an unbroken chain of male ancestors for the male genes, and female ancestors for the female genes. If one of the men without surviving male genes had 3 daughters who went on to have lots of kids, his genes wouldn&#x27;t be seen in this data, even though his other genes are with us.<p>Having gone through that line of thought, I wonder if we&#x27;re looking at some kind of &quot;compound interest&quot; effect here. I mean, if the male-only gene has 10% less chance to survive a generation, does it add up to much bigger and bigger numbers after hundreds of generations?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that clarified much...",1426730521

Very few individual users will listen to spotify for 15 hours a day like a business (bar) that plays spotify would.<p>[Edit] just read the earlier sibling comment.  I&#x27;m informing my theory based on my own very occasional usage of spotify. I suspect I&#x27;m in the long tail of their business, and I would imagine that the aggregate of businesses that play spotify all day matches up with a good portion of that long tail.",1426730510

Or that they have a deficiency in earlier material that they need to correct. Or that they need to sleep more before the test. Etc.</i><p>No, actually. When a gifted kid has been praised for their intelligence, it is common for them to generalize a failure into a shameful personal defect: they have let everyone down by failing to live up to their Potential. (And with that high IQ they can generalize very well indeed.) This can result into fear and crippling risk aversion, or conversely manic overachievement.<p><i>... ""intelligence"" is the end product of many years of effort directed at the process of learning and thinking, not something that's doled out of a box at birth.</i><p>This is crystallized intelligence, specialized knowledge that can be applied to specialized problems. It is indeed the result of long, dedicated study and practice. However it is built on a foundation of fluid intelligence (IQ) which mostly <i>is</i> doled out of a box at birth.<p><i>Learning to work hard is not a worthy goal on its own if you don't learn to work better at the same time ... This is as true in programming as it is anywhere.</i><p>I think that ""work hard"" in this context was meant to mean you should depersonalize failure, so that you don't stop working because of shame or worry.",1310223086

Then again, the problem might not be widespread enough.<p>I think I would set up my web sites in the same way: as soon as users would push the red alert button for some item on my site, I would withdraw it from public circulation and mark it for reviewing. On the upside, once it is manually reviewed, it could not be flagged again. How else would you do it?",1310220617

It's their current implementation that's slow. Java is not fast thanks to static typing, it is fast thanks to the Hotspot VM, which builds upon the StrongTalk VM implementation.<p>Quote taken around the 13"" mark (some trolling included ;) ):\n""Ruby has the dynamic part, and Java has the fast part. And this has led to this assumption that people have that the reason that Java is fast and Ruby is slow is because Java is static and Ruby is dynamic. And that's just not true, that's just a myth. Nothing about Java being fast has anything to do with it being static. It's simply that the papers that the Java people read were the ones that told you how to make it fast, and the papers that Matz read were the ones that told you how to make it usable.""",1310220542

I don't think it's reasonable to expect Amazon to shut those reviews out.",1310220504

CDs are only used in the car and even there we frequently use MP3 players. Even though we still have a vinyl record player for my old Blue Note records it's not used very often.<p>What hasn't changed is the fact that there's a lot more record companies do than distribute the final product. It's pretty clear that the reason these companies have so much power is that they produce and market artists. Without that power the distribution wouldn't be so valuable. Someone still has to pay for studios, producers, designers, publicists, etc. This is particularly true for bands that survive not so much on the musical skill of their members but the overall sound and image.",1310220448

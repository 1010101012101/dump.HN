6424504,comment,6424093,6424093,13,0,tptacek,,,"A couple random observations:<p>* The overwhelming majority of vendors here list Dual_EC_DRBG along with the HMAC and CTR DRBGs. A reminder: Dual_EC is a catastrophically slow CSPRNG that relies on bignum multiplication; if you pay any attention to crypto performance at all, you have every incentive never to use Dual_EC, and to an almost reasonable first approximation, <i>nobody</i> does. The HMAC and CTR CSPRNGs are innocuous designs based on simple conventional crypto.<p>* I&#x27;m a little suspicious of this list because it suggests Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 use only Dual_EC. Neither do; you&#x27;d have to go through contortions to make Windows use Dual_EC. Obviously, the list is about certifications and not actual field configurations, but still, you should know: Windows does not rely on Dual_EC.<p>* Here are the products (other than Windows, which, see above) that are listed as only certifying Dual_EC:<p><pre><code>    Lancope\n    Mocana\n    McAfee Firewall Console\n    Thales Datacryptor\n</code></pre>\nNone of these are particularly important industry products. McAfee is not a leading firewall vendor (Cisco and Juniper are). Lancope is a niche intrusion detection product, and Lancope is not exactly a hotbed of cryptographic research, if you get my drift. Also, the CSPRNG Lancope would be using would be relevant only to their admin console. I don&#x27;t know what Mocana or Thales do, which could be my ignorance showing, or it could be telling given what I do for a living.<p>Here&#x27;s what Bruce Schneier had to say about the Dual EC DRBG:<p><i>&quot;If this story leaves you confused, join the club. I don&#x27;t understand why the NSA was so insistent about including Dual_EC_DRBG in the standard. It makes no sense as a trap door: It&#x27;s public, and rather obvious. It makes no sense from an engineering perspective: It&#x27;s too slow for anyone to willingly use it. And it makes no sense from a backwards-compatibility perspective: Swapping one random-number generator for another is easy.&quot;</i><p>This is basically my take on Dual EC as well. I am <i>not putting it past the NSA to backdoor a crypto standard</i> (I would bet against it being a NIST standard --- if they backdoored a standard, my money is on a telephony/RF one --- but I would not bet my house against it). But this would be an inexplicable backdoor to add.",1379797139

6424493,comment,6422793,6424296,44,0,steveklabnik,,,"> (Ironically, a check that was bad because of the fee taken for &#x27;a&#x27;)<p>This is a real big problem in these kinds of situations.<p>To give you an idea of how this happens: when I was in college, I worked at a pizza shop. It was Thursday. I got paid Friday. I thought I had $20 in my bank account, but I didn&#x27;t realize that day was the day that my World of Warcraft subscription was up, and that was $15. During the course of the day, I bought lunch, a snack, and some pencils or something. All that total was less than the $20, it was something like $10 for lunch, $2 for the snack, and $5 for the pencils. So I was good.<p>I wans&#x27;t good. They applied the charges like this:<p><pre><code>  Starting Balance: $20 \n  WoW:             -$15 \n  ---------------------\n                    $ 5\n  Lunch:            $10\n  ---------------------\n                   -$ 5\n  Overdraft fee:   -$35\n  ---------------------\n                   -$40\n  Snack:           -$ 2\n  ---------------------\n                   -$42\n  Overdraft fee:   -$35\n  ---------------------\n                   -$77\n  Pencils:         -$ 5\n  ---------------------\n                   -$82\n  Overdraft fee:   -$35\n  ---------------------\n  End total:      -$117\n</code></pre>\nNow, what sucks is that if they had processed them in a different order, it would have looked like this:<p><pre><code>  Starting Balance: $20\n  Lunch:            $10\n  --------------------- \n                    $10 \n  Snack:           -$ 2 \n  --------------------- \n                    $ 8 \n  Pencils:         -$ 5 \n  --------------------- \n                    $ 3 \n  WoW:             -$15 \n  --------------------- \n                   -$12\n  Overdraft fee:   -$35\n  ---------------------\n  End total:       -$47\n\n</code></pre>\nStill an expensive mistake on my part, but it&#x27;s more subtle than &#x27;made a bad choice.&#x27; I was able to convince the bank to refund two of the fees so I was only out $40, but that extra $70 was a _massive_ amount of money to me at the time. It basically meant that I could only exactly squeak by for the next month, since that was basically all of my discretionary income. You can construct a similar situation which would have forced me to then take out a payday loan to make my bills, had I made one or two more mistakes in that same timeframe.",1379796972

6424489,comment,6424280,6424280,8,0,pcorsaro,,,"I hate reading articles like this because it&#x27;s trying to tell you that CrossFit culture is all about pushing yourself until you&#x27;ve practically killed yourself doing all sorts of crazy and whacky weight lifting. 99% of the time, the problem isn&#x27;t CrossFit, it&#x27;s the coaches. If you&#x27;re at a good gym (or box as it&#x27;s called), the coaches know how to scale workouts for the athletes so they won&#x27;t get hurt, and they&#x27;re programming workouts so that people aren&#x27;t killing themselves constantly.<p>Where CrossFit is to blame is its low barrier to entry to becoming a coach/affiliate owner. All you need is a weekend of your time, $1000, a passing score on a super simple test, and you get to call yourself an &quot;L1 CrossFit Trainer.&quot; They don&#x27;t advise you to immediately go start training people, but there are plenty of boxes that will let you jump in and start coaching classes. It&#x27;s gotten so popular now that there are bad affiliates popping up out there that have horrible programming that hurt people, and then articles like this get written, and then everyone thinks that&#x27;s all CrossFit is.<p>When you take the L1 CrossFit Trainer course, they have a whole section about &quot;Uncle Rhabdo.&quot; It&#x27;s a very rare thing that occurs when you do a whole lot of isometric exercises (like strict pull ups where you come down real slow) when you&#x27;re not used to them.

6424383,comment,6423609,6423978,8,0,hncomment,,,"As a North American who enjoys discussing taboo subjects clinically and honestly, and in the interest of cultural understanding, I would explain it as:<p>Cleanliness standards for the hands are much higher than for the rectum area. For hands, not just water but soap is expected, after any work with biologically-suspect materials or surfaces (raw foods, places of illness, bathroom visits).<p>But for &quot;down below,&quot; the paper-wipe is considered sufficient, with usual assumptions about clothing, bathing schedule, etc. The paper enables wiping until there&#x27;s no trace (on the white paper) of any feces. The seated toilet (less common in other regions) helped spread open the rear cheeks; after standing any surfaces that were only-paper-wiped seem very nearly &#x27;retracted&#x27; so as to not even be in contact with underwear. Within 12-24 hours, a full-body bathe and freshly-cleaned clothes are likely.<p>Still, those with predictable bowel movements may time them so they immediately precede a daily shower. In many bathrooms the sink is close enough to allow wetting toilet paper for part of the cleanup, and prepackaged moistened wipes are rising in popularity, and have long been used for messy-baby-cleanup.<p>Turning things around and looking at rinse-cultures, I&#x27;m probably not alone among North Americans in wondering:<p>(1) Doesn&#x27;t the spray get droplets of feces-water mix everywhere? (Supposedly ideal bathroom hygiene is to close the toilet lid before flushing, to avoid sending a mist of toilet water into the air. Any forced-water rinsing seems to guarantee a mixed-mist reaches everywhere, including parts of the buttocks and legs far from the rectum that are never contaminated by paper-wiping.)<p>(2) Short of absolutely drenching yourself with multiple power rinses, how do you know you&#x27;re &quot;done&quot; - that none of the remaining dampness is still fecal-contaminated water? (White paper provides a visual completion indicator.)<p>(3) My very rough impression is that fecally-transmitted diseases (typhoid, hepatitis, cholera, anything diarrhea-causing, etc.) are more prevalent in rinse-cultures. Are you sure that &quot;a lot of South Asian countries&quot; should be the &quot;ideal way to wash&quot; model, as opposed to the other way around? (North American practice would change very fast if there were evidence paper-wiping was insufficient to protect health.)",1379795489

So many people here talking about why poor people do things the way they do without having ever really experienced it.<p>Here&#x27;s why poor people don&#x27;t like banks: because banks don&#x27;t like them.<p>Let me paint you some pictures.<p>You&#x27;re not clean-shaven. You smell a little bit, whether because you just finished a smelly job or because you&#x27;re living on the streets or because you&#x27;re depressed and haven&#x27;t bothered to clean up in a day. You enter the bank, and no less than four pair of eyes look at you -- eyes that are surrounded by expensive haircuts, ties, and nice dresses or suits.<p>You&#x27;re exhausted and you can&#x27;t concentrate well. Maybe it&#x27;s the chronic lack of sleep, maybe it&#x27;s malnutrition, maybe it&#x27;s stress, or maybe it&#x27;s drugs or alcohol. You walk up to a counter with a check in hand. This paper is worthless to you, what you need is a different kind of paper that you can trade for things you need.<p>The teller asks you if you&#x27;re a customer. She&#x27;s polite, but polite in that barely perceptible condescending way that people are when they&#x27;re uncomfortable with the person they&#x27;re talking to.<p>You&#x27;re not a customer. She&#x27;ll have to charge you for cashing the check then (or maybe won&#x27;t do it at all -- depending on company policy).<p>Can you be a customer? She directs you over to a desk. The desk has a nice finish on it. It&#x27;s probably worth more than anything you own. It might even be worth more than everything you own.<p>You sit down at the desk and another person with a polite smile, perfect hair, and a nice tie or suit or dress asks you for some personal information and enters it into the computer.<p>You&#x27;re poor, so you <i>hate</i> computers. They keep track of you everywhere you go. You can&#x27;t seem to escape them. The police in different towns all somehow have access to the same information about you. Computers produce paperwork that occasionally makes it into your P.O. Box, or last address, or friend&#x27;s address, and usually it&#x27;s bad paperwork: more bad news, more stress, more trouble. Some faceless agency somewhere wants more of what you don&#x27;t have.<p>This computer is no different. A few keystrokes later, the representative apologizes in that polite-but-condescending way: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, you&#x27;re here in Chex Systems for account abuse at BigCorp Bank three years ago, we can&#x27;t open an account for you.&quot;<p>This is the sixth bank you&#x27;ve been to.<p>Three years later, after a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work and a struggle that will forever leave a scar on your soul, you&#x27;ve finally reached the five-year expiration period for Chex Systems, you&#x27;ve finally got a regular job with a regular paycheck that is just barely enough to live on. You&#x27;re set up with free checking at some bank, but you&#x27;re very very careful not to overdraw your account, ever, because that one time you did it suddenly somehow turned into $250 of money that you owed the bank -- money that you didn&#x27;t have, because if you did, the bank wouldn&#x27;t be asking for it.<p>But this morning, your beater car finally crapped out for good and the low-rent apartment complex you live in forbids you from working on it in the parking lot. You can&#x27;t get to work without the car. You have a little bit of savings, about $100, and you just need to borrow a little bit of money so that you can get another beater and get back to work as soon as possible. Your job doesn&#x27;t offer paid sick days, so every day you&#x27;re out of work, you get a little bit poorer.<p>You walk or get a ride down to your bank and you sit down behind that desk, and that computer that you still hate, and you ask the polite-but-still-a-little-condescending nicely-dressed person if you can get a car loan. You quickly add, &quot;I don&#x27;t need much, only a few hundred dollars, and I&#x27;ll be able to get this car I saw down the street from my apartment.&quot; You make promises and tell the representative how important this is to you, because you&#x27;re under the mistaken impression that the representative has the ability to make a decision. But it&#x27;s not up to them, it&#x27;s up to the computer.<p>The representative politely tells you that they don&#x27;t do car loans for a few hundred dollars, they only do loans for a couple thousand. You don&#x27;t need a couple thousand -- in fact, the very idea of borrowing that much is really scary to you, because you&#x27;re pretty sure that if somebody gave you that much money you&#x27;d mess up with it, just like you always do, and then you&#x27;d owe <i>a lot</i> of money that you&#x27;d have no way of paying back.<p>But the representative tries to get you a couple thousand dollars for a car anyway. The computer says no: you don&#x27;t have enough credit, your credit is too bad, you don&#x27;t make enough, you don&#x27;t have collateral. In short: you are too poor.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re a customer. It doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you&#x27;re <i>trying</i>. It&#x27;s just like all your friends say, it&#x27;s what you hear all the time: banks only lend you money if you don&#x27;t need it.<p>--<p>That was me. For years. I&#x27;m reasonably intelligent, I&#x27;ve never had a drug or alcohol problem. Still, though, I made a relatively simple decision many years ago, to take a vacation from the computer industry for a while and be a climbing instructor. Unfortunately, while being a climbing instructor was amazing and I&#x27;m still glad I did it, it didn&#x27;t pay very much, and eventually I got into trouble with a bank.<p>The economy started to have trouble then (dot-com bust), my computer skills were more of a liability than an asset, and for the next several years I struggled desperately to keep my head just barely above water. I was homeless for a while.<p>I&#x27;ve got my own business now and my finances are better and I <i>still</i> hate banks. I love the people at my local bank, but I hate banks.",1379795344

Do we have to be either for or against AGW and therefore for or against mitigating it? Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to suggest looking at AGW in context, and also to show that humanity is going to have to deal with far greater swings over the long term in climate than just a few degrees?<p>If anything I&#x27;d say this long-term chart indicates we have to redouble our efforts to understand climate change, and if we can&#x27;t control it, work on ways to mitigate its effects, because even if we control our own short term effects, long term the earth will move from ice age to tropical and we&#x27;ll have to adapt.",1379795127

She has three kids and one month she was hit with fees for a) having less than a prescribed amount in her bank account. and b) writing a bad check. (Ironically, a check that was bad because of the fee taken for &#x27;a&#x27;).<p>Now for her, going to Walmart every month and putting her earnings on a prepaid card gives her everything she needs with little of the risk. And so that&#x27;s what she does. It&#x27;s not a &quot;check cashing place&quot; or &quot;payday loan&quot; place, but it is one of the places siphoning the poor from the banks. (My guess is that it&#x27;s probably siphoning a lot of them too).<p>I think sometimes it&#x27;s a little easy to lose sight of that single mother with three kids working a low end job. She really can&#x27;t afford fees like that... though the fees may sound trivial to the middle class. When she gets home, she HAS to have food for her children. And among a lot of what you might term the &quot;responsible single mothers&quot;, anything that would put their ability to do that at risk is, rightfully, eliminated.<p>Bank accounts, in their current form, are on the list of things that can put that at risk. And so, bank accounts are eliminated.<p>After that conversation, it was not clear to me that she had made a bad decision. I couldn&#x27;t really question her priorities. A bank account was good for me... but maybe not for her. This is why I think that these sorts of decisions will be made more and more often by the poor. Because they only care about the ends, (feeding her kids). Not the means, (the bank account).<p>I guess I&#x27;m just saying that...<p>It wasn&#x27;t clear to me that it was an... &quot;...effing bad decision.&quot;",1379794417

6424252,comment,6422682,6423046,1,0,notahacker,,,"The monopoly experiment as described in the article doesn&#x27;t sound like especially convincing evidence for the hypothesis that wealth makes people inconsiderate though: the researchers - with openly stated personal biases - observed that people playing a game rigged in their favour snacked more, and then usually didn&#x27;t dispute their entitlement to win the game after winning. I don&#x27;t believe that actually illustrates anything about wealth at all. You&#x27;d have to go some way to convince me that Monopoly is a good proxy for wealth, never mind explaining away competing explanations for the exhibited behaviour not associated with courtesy or wealth (winners are generally not disposed towards disavowing their entitlement to win, and those with a simpler challenge have every reason to enjoy themselves more or concentrate less). If his findings suggested that people that started off &quot;rich&quot; were more likely to feel they deserved to win than winners of a fair game it would have been a more interesting finding...",1379793727
6424251,comment,6422793,6423968,4,0,a3n,,,"Anecdote of one: I bank with Wells Fargo, I go inside the branch less than once per month, and I rarely see the same tellers or &quot;bankers&quot; (the ones that sit at a desk) from visit to visit. I think it&#x27;s pretty high turnover. I don&#x27;t know the reason, but I suspect it&#x27;s because the bank is trying to sell me services like insurance, and there&#x27;s pressure on bankers to make sales. It may also be because a teller or banker job is a young person&#x27;s first career-like job, from which they move on and up as soon as possible.<p>In fact I hate it when I have to talk to a banker, I get annoyed when they try to sell me services that have nothing at all to do with what I went in for, or with why I&#x27;m a customer in the first place.<p>Also, I suspect because of turnover, they usually can&#x27;t answer my questions when I ask. They just do not know the answer to &quot;how do I do this particular bank-like thing&quot; without researching and asking the branch manager. But man they do know all about their insurance products.",1379793711

PhDs have demonstrated the ability to read the literature and conduct research under supervision. That is not necessarily very valuable (knowledge gained during that process may or may not be very valuable). And, honestly, the research often seems very mickey-mouse compared to real world problems, of the &quot;assume a spherical cow in a vacuum&quot; variety. That&#x27;s nice, but does it get me to launch with the feature sets I need? If not, your value is not high. If so, well, name your price.",1379793710

Could anyone with more insight into these things explain further why this is unique and whether there might be drawbacks? This almost seems too good to be true.<p>(for background, I just want a 3D printer to tinker with, and if it works at all for $100 I&#x27;ll be satisfied - I might have as much fun building it as using it)",1379793697

The issue is that academia has grown a lot over the past several decades [1]. Federal funding has approximately doubled in the past two decades, and the annual number of PhDs has increased by ~50% [2].  At the same time, the number of tenure track faculty positions in the US has nearly halved [3].<p>So you have a situation in which we&#x27;re training a lot more PhDs, so mean research group size is growing dramatically, but we&#x27;re offering fewer of the sort of academic jobs that can allow them to excel in their trained discipline.  As these folks then leave academia, they&#x27;re very often leaving for jobs outside their field.  This is a really unfortunate loss of the incredible taxpayer investment in their education that we should all be supporting, not discouraging.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy2014/fedperf14p.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy2014/fedperf14p.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf10308/tab3.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf10308/tab3.gif</a><p>[3] (embarassing wiki link, since labor statistics are a nightmare to sort though) \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_(academic)#From_1972_to_the_present"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_(academic)#From_1972_to_...</a>",1379793616

Looking up the big speech the Galt character gives in Atlas Shrugged, it's amazing how much of it relates. This paragraph in particular reads like it could have been pg's battle cry against soul-sucking faceless corporations that demand all of your creativity and trust none of your judgement:<p>""While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem  I beat you to it, I reached them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp. I showed them the way to live by another morality  mine.

That may not have been what you meant, but that's certainly how it comes across to someone with a more neutral view of startup culture. Your addendum doesn't really change that, because you're still positing a dichotomy of what software engineers can be: EITHER we're go-getter startup founders, XOR we're caged animals suffering as our souls slowly die, depending on which environment we end up in.

Moreover, I use cpufreq to scale my frequency down to 800 MHz during low usage.<p>With all that said, I can kill and restore Firefox (with 20 plugins) with 16 tabs open (including a YouTube video) in about 10 seconds, at the same time that I am running Pidgin (IM client), 4 terminal sessions, compiling a kernel, and copying /dev/random to another machine over SSH (through fuse).

Perhaps we were an exception in the past, but students who are savvy at both business and technical things are becoming increasingly more common today, thanks to Universities.  Technology spurs change; people who adapt survive.  People who spend a bunch of time whining about change don't tend to survive.  Universities teach people ways of adapting to change, and different ways of thinking.<p>It does take a bit of forward thinking, and that's where I think business students have a slight advantage.  Writing code is great, wonderful, and something I love to do.  Many business students would say that in the grand scheme of things, it's a useless talent unless it solves some kind of problem.  Many techies would say that in the grand scheme of things, it's an incredibly useful talent, as it involves understanding the underlying structure or system.  Although my formal education is in business, guess what? I agree 100 percent with the latter; I don't know where people get their stereotypes about MBAs, but there's really no such thing as a ""typical"" MBA.  Most of us are, on some level or another, systems people.<p>Indeed, one of the more valuable lessons I gained from mine was to stop seeing ""problems"" and start seeing ""opportunities"".

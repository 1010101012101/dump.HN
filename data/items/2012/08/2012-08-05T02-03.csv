The desired outcome goals of the company outweighs the desired outcome expressed by any individual executive. Incentive structures can reflect that.<p>There are many ways to accomplish this, but the reality is shareholders who wield sufficient power to enforce this goal-seeking simply are not interested in doing this. That's the real nut to crack.

Likely, Microsoft uses a shitty hash function to scramble passwords.<p>The common gospel around here is to say ""Use bcrypt."", but very few people say (or know?) that its maximum input length  is 55 bytes, i.e. 55 ASCII characters, or far fewer unicode characters. Most implementations actually cut off the remainder, which is a very dangerous thing to do since you might have people who use a relatively simple passphrase followed by a strong password which happens to be beyond the maximum length, and is lost.<p>For most other hash algorithms, if you use a hash function with an output size of 256 bits, you will lose entropy if the input contains more than 256 bits of entropy. It is a little hard to measure what the maximum length should be for e.g. passwords, but the length should almost never be unlimited.

There is a huge argument for what you're saying, but there's other forces at play.  One aspect that plays into it is that C is a really nice layer on top of assembly, and there are a lot of extremely talented embedded C software engineers, (I'm assuming) moreso than the number of available Ada engineers.  Also, keep in mind this is a pretty conservative domain.  What has worked in the past is trusted much more than what might work better.  Up until a decade or so, there was no operating system to speak of and most development used hardware controllers.<p>Also, C is not the only horse in town.  In fact, I hear that Ada is actually pretty popular in space-flight.  Other missions have successfully leveraged FORTH even.  Using a Lisp read-eval print loop from many millions of miles away once saved the Voyager mission.<p>One really interesting point of view on this topic is Ron Garret's essay called ""Lisping at JPL,"" available at <a href=""http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html</a> .",1344134114

To be fair, most of these ""git sucks"" posts in the past have been people moving from svn and complaining that git doesn't do it the Right Way(tm) ""like svn does."" In most of these cases, it has boiled down to:<p>1. I tried to use git like svn without attempting to do much learning at all and it bit me in the ass.<p>2. svn does things The Right And Only True Way(tm) and git doesn't, therefore git sucks.<p>3. svn has a command named 'svn <action>' and git has a command named 'git <action>' but they do different things. Therefore git sucks because (obviously) svn has the One And Only Correct Definition of <action> that 'makes sense.'<p>The other arguments amount stuff like:<p>1. I use mercurial all of the time and I don't understand how anyone can use git because of <filter-branch | commit --amend | rebase --interactive | etc> that allows you to rewrite commits. If people are allowed to rewrite commits, then obviously all developers using git do things like rewrite the X year-old commit that introduced the bug rather than creating a new commit to fix the bug. <Here is where I continue to rant about how scary the ability to rewrite commits is while demonstrating that I have little to no actual experience with git, or a single bad experience that I'm extrapolating from>.<p>In general, I find that I can empathize with people that get worked up over ""git sucks"" rants, because for the most part they either make no compelling arguments, or they bury a couple of compelling arguments under a ton of unstructured ranting about strawmen.",1344134016

Seeing the consequences of such things it makes me appreciate git is left as raw interactions. Git is not for people that do not want to understand it. To me, it's similar to vim - its basic implementation is bare essentials and complicated concepts, but once mastered, far outweigh competitors who roll those concepts up into simpler ones and leave you with workflows on their terms.",1344132420

4340331,comment,4339999,4339999,37,0,mvanveen,,,"A few summers ago I was an intern at JPL working on a static analysis suite for this exact standard.<p>Writing code checkers for these sorts of rules is a really interesting exercise and it helped me grow a lot as a programmer!  I went from having no exposure to formal languages, parsing, and grammars to actively playing around with these concepts to try and help build more reliable software.  It was a humbling, challenging, and incredibly rewarding experience.<p>Sometimes, a rule is extremely simple to implement.  For example, checking a rule that requires that  an assert is raised after every so many lines within a given scope is just a matter of picking the right sed expression.  Other times, you really need an AST to be able to do anything at all.<p>A rule like ""In compound expressions with multiple sub-expressions the intended 
order of evaluation  shall be made explicit with parentheses"" is particularly challenging.  I spent a few weeks on this rule!  I was banging my head, trying to learn the fundamentals of parsing languages, spending my hours diving into wikipedia articles and learning lex and yacc.  The grad students at LaRS were always extremely helpful and were always willing to help tutor me and teach me what I needed to learn (hi mihai and cheng if you're reading!).  After consulting them and scratching our heads for a while, we figured we might be able to do it with a shift-reduce parser when a shift or reduce ambiguity is introduced during the course of parsing a source code file.  This proved beyond the scope of what I'd be able to do within an internship, but it helped me appreciate the nuance and complexity hidden within even seemingly simple statements about language properties.<p>Automated analysis of these rules gives you a really good appreciation of the Chomsky language hierarchy because the goal is always to create the simplest possible checker you can reliably show is able to accurately cover all the possible cases.  Sometimes that is simple as a regular language, but the next rule might require you to have a parser for the language.<p>For what it's worth, this is only one of the ways the guys at LaRS (<a href=""http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/</a>) help try to improve software reliability on-lab.  Most of the members are world-class experts in formal verification analysis and try to integrate their knowledge with missions as effectively as possible.  Sometimes, this means riding the dual responsibility of functioning as a researcher and a embedded flight software engineer, working alongside the rest of the team.<p>If anyone's interested in trying out static analysis of C on your own, I highly reccomend checking out Eli Bendersky's awesome C parser for Python (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/</a>).  I found it leaps and bounds better than the existing closed-source toolsets we had licenses for, like Coverity Extend.  At the time, it had the extremely horrible limitation of only parsing ANSI 89, but Eli has since improved the parser to have ANSI 99 compliance.  Analyzing C in Python is a dream.",1344132210

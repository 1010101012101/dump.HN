However, when handed a simple programming problem the natural instinct is to ask for just a little more information.<p>I find many programmers have issues quickly context switching between thinking about the problem, discovering what the constraints are, coding a solution, and then debugging that solution.

I don't know the details though about type of cancer etc.<p>But those cultures didn't have cancer, din't have obesity, diabetes, heart disease ... I don't even know what diseases they died from.<p>I do not have the book ""Cancer, Disease of Civilisation"" and the blog post does not tell about the age. Here's the compilation of two other blog entries from the same blog:<p><a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/07/cancer-among-inuit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/07/cancer-among-i...</a><p><i>One of these physicians was captain George B. Leavitt. He actively searched for cancer among the traditionally-living Inuit from 1885 to 1907. Along with his staff, he performed 50,000 examinations a year for the first 15 years, and 25,000 a year thereafter. He did not find a single case of cancer. At the same time, he was regularly diagnosing cancers among the crews of whaling ships and other Westernized populations. It's important to note two relevant facts about Inuit culture: first, their habit of going shirtless indoors. This would make visual inspection for external cancers very easy. Second, the Inuit generally had great faith in Western doctors and would consult them even for minor problems. Therefore, doctors in the arctic had ample opportunity to inspect them for cancer.</i><p>This entry does not mention lifespan, but the other one does:<p><a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/07/mortality-and-lifespan-of-inuit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/07/mortality-and-...</a><p><i>Excluding infant mortality, about 25% of their population lived past 60. Based on these data, the approximate life expectancy (excluding infant mortality) of this Inuit population was 43.5 years. It's possible that life expectancy would have been higher before contact with the Russians, since they introduced a number of nasty diseases to which the Inuit were not resistant.</i><p>I do not have data at hand about cancer rates in the western world by age, but my guess would be that it's not so uncommon at the age of 60+.",1287308413

1799977,comment,1797964,1798621,0,0,hedgie,,,"Why would anyone ask to find primes?  Most people don't know the best algorithm and anyone who needs to code efficient ways of determining primality has intense number theory training.<p>The ""naive"" solution typically is a sieve method and checks more than the required number of factors (goes beyond sqrt(n)).  It's like asking someone to sort an array and expecting bubble sort because you never use sorting algorithms in what you actually code.<p>The best way I know (and there are actually better) to find primes is using an approximation algorithm that no one would ever come up with independently without months of research.  The Miller-Rabin primality test finds if a candidate for primality n has a % chance of being prime by looking for numbers a < n that don't satisfy Fermat's little equation.  Almost every composite number violates Fermat's little equation (Carmichael numbers are the only exceptions).<p>Once you hit the desired probability that n is prime (testing more a < n raises this probability) you use a deterministic method to determine 100% if n is prime.  If it isn't you throw it out and use Miller-Rabin to find another candidate.  Even though you might throw some candidates out and have to pick others to check for primality this method is far faster than a purely deterministic solution using a naive sieve methods.<p>This is a moronic test of ability.  It exposes the arrogance of the company in assuming they can evaluate candidates in 15 minutes by asking the most challenging number theory problems out there when they have no understanding of the current methods in the discipline.",1287306921

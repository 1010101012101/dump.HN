For more serious bloggers or writers, it is more of a marketing tool. And they place no value in comments, which looks more like a deliberate design decision.<p>However, I like Medium because they have broken new ground in UI design (for writing especially). It was the app that convinced me that you don&#x27;t really need boxed HTML form inputs anywhere; it is more natural to edit in place with &quot;contenteditable&quot;. This holds true not just for &quot;blog writing&quot; on Medium, but for profile edits and everywhere else. (I am aware of other advantages of using forms, but still.)<p>Now it might seem like just getting rid of textareas.

In the forecast domains I work, (I use neural networks on standardized inputs) I typically use 50-100 epochs at most for a few thousand rows (with some approx 10 input neurons) and I don&#x27;t see networks improving very much after that.<p>However, our industry peers often use a few thousand up to several ten thousands of epochs, yet our software is regularly best or second best when compared by clients.<p>I think this may be the same effect: Network weights should be &quot;ok&quot; after a few dozen epochs and any training beyond that maybe wins a percent of variance explained but already  risks overfitting.<p>We use the spare time to train more networks (on slightly different input data) whose results we aggregate after that.<p>Something else: can someone explain the &quot;I don&#x27;t make no nevermind&quot;, I suppose it&#x27;s funny but I don&#x27;t get it.",1401087357

I was about to come and comment on this, and was glad to see that you already made it in the thread :-)  I also wish I still had time for unrevoked-like projects.<p>One of the things that I think differentiates the Android community from the iOS community is a focus on short term results.  I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  On the upside, more freed devices is generally a positive thing, and OEM branches of Android -- at least, in the past -- have been a veritable 0day tree (shake them and exploits just fall out onto the ground).  On the downside, vendors have been getting more competent at reverse engineering exploits than they were in the unrevoked days, and so exploits are usually well and truly burned once they&#x27;ve been released.  This means that early users who want &quot;more more more, now now now&quot; mean that later users may not get to unlock their device at all.<p>The iOS groups seem to solve this by timing releases together, based on Apple hardware.  I <i>suspect</i> that this is a more sustainable model... but on the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t matter what I think, because as bounties like this grow, it&#x27;s not a model that can thrive :-)  Oh, well.",1401087046

7798940,comment,7798082,7798825,8,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"> That&#x27;s great for veterans, but actively hostile to newbies.<p>I would have to respectfully disagree. With the copious amounts of man-pages, the availability of vim-tutor (for this particular case), and all other avenues of help available within most Unix tools, I cannot agree with the notion that software (vim, in particular) is actively hostile. Compared to the copious amounts of software that is far less documented, and far less robust than the standard Unix set of tools, I think calling the command line hostile is at best downright laziness.<p>Please don&#x27;t call something hostile if you&#x27;ve barely given it a chance. Not every tool needs to be wrapped in a fully animated tutorial with buttons everywhere. In fact, the more elegant tools often don&#x27;t have these things and do their best to stay out of your way. Which leads to the next part of your comment:<p>> You&#x27;d think there could be some sort of middle ground.<p>Why would there be? Any middle ground would risk upsetting two groups: the power users that want the tool to stay out of the way and do what it&#x27;s meant to do, and the group of newbies (or regular users) that can&#x27;t figure out what the tool was designed for or the best way to use it. The regular users wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with the help available for any middle-ground tool, and power users would just find that the half-baked tutorials, help system, or user support just got in the way. This would cause a rift in the community, which would force some users to search for a replacement that gives better help, while the power users would drift to a similar tool with the cruft and bell and whistles removed.<p>If you&#x27;re just a regular user, and you end up using a tool like Notepad++ or Nano or some other editor instead of Vim or Emacs, and you can&#x27;t for the life of you figure out vim or emacs, that is completely fine. Continue using the tool you are capable of wielding. However, that&#x27;s not to say that vim or emacs don&#x27;t have their own documentation and help systems, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not served to the user in the same way. It may not be directly obvious when switching between systems (example: standard help documentation in Windows is nothing like using man or info pages), but I would reckon that it is only immediately non-obvious because you&#x27;re already used to another way of searching for help.<p>So please stop calling software hostile, and give it a chance. Truly hostile software exists, but I can guarantee you that basic command line utilities are not it.",1401086913

Otherwise, we&#x27;re just taking the word of other people (the regulators).<p>Here&#x27;s one question: I&#x27;d like to know who specifically was behind the huge volume in put options on United and American Airlines stock immediately before the 9/11 attack. Someone was essentially shorting those two airlines, and only those two. (For example, Bloomberg data showed that on 6 September 2001, the Thursday before the attack, the put-option volume in UAL stock was nearly 100 times higher than normal: 2,000 options versus 27 on the previous day.) The 9/11 Commission report concluded that, &quot;A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy&quot;, but they refused to identify who it was.<p>Everything is not so transparent unless there&#x27;s some public repository for all this information that I&#x27;m not aware of.",1401084928

It used to be as easy as graduating from a public high school in Georgia with a 3.0 GPA, and would cover all your tuition, up to 15 credit hours per semester.  Once you were in college, I don&#x27;t believe there were even any GPA requirements.  Today, I think you need a 3.7 GPA to qualify. EDIT: Looks like you still just need a 3.0, but there are additional &#x27;academic rigor&#x27; requirements on the high school courses you take.<p>It was a spectacular bargain (and still is, but to fewer students), and paid for my degree at Georgia Tech, which is a pretty good school.  The system is funded by lottery revenue, though, which brings up some thorny issues.  The majority of people who buy lottery tickets are working class, but the majority of HOPE recipients are upper-middle class - effectively a bizarre reverse-welfare program.<p>In most other states, similar programs don&#x27;t exist, and even students who are willing to stay in-state and work while they go to school end up with some student debt.",1401084209

The Ionic framework is based out of Madison, made by two Wisconsin grads. Gener8tor is an accelerator in this city and they&#x27;re growing. They really do provide good opportunities to founders, and they have funding from State Farm insurance that seems to be steady, so I have hope that things can really go somewhere. Though I have to say that having been around their office and at a few events they really don&#x27;t feel tech-oriented.<p>And then the university has their own stuff.

Libraries like theano already let you build up a function graph in this way -- see theano.scan[2], for example, which is something like a fancy fixed-point combinator.<p>The idea about types corresponding to representations seems like it would be hard to make precise, because at a type level everything&#x27;s pretty much just R^n or perhaps some simple submanifold of R^n. &quot;Has representation X&quot; isn&#x27;t a crisp logical concept, and in most type theories I know of types are crisp logical properties.<p>Even if you can accomodate fuzzy/statistical types somehow, I would tend to think of a representation as being the function that does the representing of a particular domain, rather than the range or the distribution of the outputs of that function. Two very different representations might have a similar distribution of outputs but not represent compatible concepts at all.<p>Still there is a neat observation here that by combining two different representations downstream of the cost function you&#x27;re optimising (e.g. by adding their outputs together and using that as input to another layer) you can force them in some sense to conform to the same representation, or at least to be compatible with eachother in some sense. You could probably formalise this in a way that lets you talk about equivalence classes of representation-compatible intermediate values in a network as types.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t really typecheck stuff for you in a useful way -- if you accidentally add together two things of different types, by definition they become the same type! But I guess it would do type inference. For most networks I&#x27;m not sure if this would tell you anything you didn&#x27;t already know though.<p>If you want to find a useful connection between deep learning and typed FP, you could start by thinking about what problem you&#x27;d want your type system to solve in the context of deep learning. What could it usefully prove, check or infer about your network architecture?<p>[1] I was going to say &quot;a differentiable function&quot;, but actually they&#x27;re often not these days what with ReLUs, max-pooling etc. The non-differentiable points are swept under the rug in that I don&#x27;t see anyone bothering with subgradient-based optimisation methods.<p>[2] <a href=""http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/scan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/scan.html</a>",1441324588

So foo->bar if foo is an integer would do something like ((Foo<i>)foo)->bar where Foo is a struct that contains a member named bar, and foo.bar would be like ((Foo</i>)&foo)->bar. The text doesn’t say how ambiguity is resolved (i.e., if there are multiple structs that have a member with the given name).<p>This is because in pre-ANSI C the names of struct fields were not internal to their enclosing struct but global identifiers that simply represented a type and offset. There was no ambiguity because different structs could not have the same member names.

To start of I&#x27;d just like to clarify that I&#x27;m a student at the University and have no ties to any of the administration.<p>The goal of the post was not to try and take credit for the successes of alumni, I rather wrote it to highlight how some of our alumni have gone on to do great things. I decided to write it after an experience I had this summer while I was interning at a VC firm in NYC. While there, I met the managing partner for one of NYC&#x27;s biggest VC firms (I&#x27;ll leave it unnamed) who basically said: &#x27;oh, you go to UIUC.... they&#x27;ve produced one famous tech entrepreneur (Marc Andreessen), maybe you can be the second&#x27;. That&#x27;s a sentiment I saw echoed throughout my time there and through previous experiences (especially on the East Coast).<p>In terms of the helping alumni with their ventures after graduation, I&#x27;d argue that the school has actually done a lot to help founders through the resources and early-stage funding available (a lot of these have sprung up recently). It&#x27;s hard to compare it to Stanford/MIT/Harvard which are based in thriving tech cities where alumni and VCs can hop by on campus whenever.<p>Update: I&#x27;d also love to know (from everyone that sees this) what programs other universities have done to help alumni after graduation. Just because UIUC hasn&#x27;t already done this doesn&#x27;t mean we (students and alumni) can&#x27;t start it.

10168130,comment,10166046,10166046,0,0,daviross,,,"This entire thread seems somewhat missing without the famous predecessor article Against Narrativity <a href=""http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/against_narrativity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/against_narrativity.pdf</a> by the same author.<p>The linked article provides some phrases/concepts which seem more amenable to grappling with/interacting with. Specifically, it breaks the concept of Narrativity into the psychological Narrativity thesis (That it is human nature to experience their lives as a story or collection of stories, with narrative arcs and plot points as we&#x27;re used to describing in fiction),\nand the ethical Narrativity thesis (That the act of experiencing/conceiving of one&#x27;s life as a narrative is a capital-g Good Thing, and that narrativity is essential to full personhood).<p>From there, it splits outlooks based on truth values. One could think that humans are innately narrative-driven in their thoughts and that this is good (many people here). Alternately, one could think that people are narrative-driven and this isn&#x27;t good (This also shows up in the article). Contrarily, one could think that people aren&#x27;t innately narrative (but that it&#x27;s good to aspire to), or lastly that narrativism isn&#x27;t innate, and that it isn&#x27;t good to assume that this is the case.<p>I find the last one compelling, myself. Many people do continually tell themselves the story of themselves, but this isn&#x27;t innate/required. One can have a series of events, see the causality, and have plans for the future without a Narrative. Believing in the Narrative would suggest things like believing that your life is part of the Campbellian Hero&#x27;s Journey.<p>This is sometimes helpful, as it can suggest to people that they can hold on for things to get better, but it&#x27;s also where we get things like the decried Nice Guy behavior where men expect that inputting kindness coins leads to the sex payoff, because those are the stories they&#x27;re immersed in and the ones they believe in.  I&#x27;ve seen schizophrenics describe their mental models as taking this pattern-matching wiring in humans and having it turned up to eleven. Seeing data points and watching connections form to where there&#x27;s a Grand Narrative connecting things. (Not a point against them, though to me at least it does point towards narrative pattern-matching as something people can vary more and less in feeling tendencies towards.)<p>As for myself, I sometimes tell narrative tales of myself, but it feels like a deliberate thing. I can describe my past in narrative arcs (and it&#x27;s a really good point made above that there&#x27;s many incentives to do so in the workplace), but it&#x27;s not something I feel is actually the case or needs to be the case. &quot;Plucky young farmboy gets into computers, is drawn to the Big City by Megacorp, has a fall-from-grace there&quot;. Where does the story go from here? Under a Narrativist mindset, there&#x27;s some predictive capacity here. Fall-from-grace leads to soul-searching and redemption? If we could use narratives to predict the future, that would definitely point towards Narrative as a driving force. On the other hand, being able to say &quot;No, my story doesn&#x27;t have to go like this, I don&#x27;t have to have a story leading me in this direction&quot; is powerful. By throwing off those chains of narrativity, it allows some measure of greater control.<p>So yes, I think people are drawn towards personal narratives. They&#x27;re compelling. We&#x27;re surrounded by stories all the time. There&#x27;s incentives to talk about one&#x27;s past in that way. But they can be confining, and they can lead to harmful behavior as people are immersed in stories suggesting specific arcs.",1441323987

But I think eventually software growth then pushes them to more complex interchange format, e.g. JSON schema.<p>I think that there is progress, with JSON on the simpler side, and now newer formats like ProtoBufs, Thrift and mechanisms such as RPC - we do seem to be learning from the past. It does feel that perhaps we do swing from one extreme to another - first RPC was great and CORBA came and went, following this the perception was that it was utterly unsuitable for anything, until perhaps the introduction of ProtoBufs, Thift, JSON-RPC and so on.

Deep reductions in the draft released many young men into the workforce and allowed them to start businesses. During the war, only being an exempt student or employed in an essential job could keep you out of the way of bullets.<p>* The beginning of mass immigration. After the long pause between the 1924 immigration act and the 1965 act, immigration ramped up again. Mass Latin American immigration stepped up -- documented and undocumented -- in the 1970s and continued rising. Dozens of work visa programs brought in Asian and European workers.<p>* End of the gold exchange standard in 1971. Gold didn&#x27;t actually circulate but was a synecdoche for the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Bretton Woods kept world currencies stable and made trade very hard to sustain because currency values couldn&#x27;t adjust to compensate for imbalances. Soon the European currencies would float entirely free and world trade would be able to take advantage of differential wages more easily.<p>* China opened. Mao Tse-Tung was getting senile by 1970 and progressives in China opened up the economy under his nose. By the late 1970s, radical leftist Deng Hsiao-Ping had seized control of the country and implemented the wholesale neoliberal reforms that have turned China from a land of North Korean and Mauritanian backwardness into a modern wealthy nation leading the world. Competition from China could be affecting wages all over.<p>* The first Mideast oil crisis was in 1973.

The bottom of the tire only goes up the &quot;side&quot; for a limited distance. If I lean too far the side of my tire no longer touches the ground<p>Also, the lean angle would have to be related to the foot peg size. My current foot peg is quite long--even for mild lean angles somestimes I can feel the road scratching on my boots and the foot peg.",1441321334

Getting some aspects of your prediction right is virtually guaranteed if you generalize when you re-interpret later.<p>You&#x27;d have to make spectacularly bad predictions that are overly detailed and specific NOT to do half decently if we&#x27;re going to allow post-hoc retrofitting of which broad trends kind of fit the original prediction.",1441321267

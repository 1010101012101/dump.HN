I am a big made in America fan and when I first heard about them I bought one of their half zip sweatshirts. Order number 212 or so. Came with a signed thank you card from the CEO. The quality is excellent and the look is classic with a great fit. I actually just received my Black Friday order yesterday, the day that Slate article came out. They were out of one of the colors I ordered and I got a hand written note from one of their customer service people. Great stuff, great customer service, great story.

He's saying people who are unhappy should stop and think about whether or not they're pursuing things that might make them happy in the major aspects of their lives (location, career, friends, hobbies, etc.).<p>I don't buy into your BS about ""learning to be happy with what you have"" because it glosses over the whole ""what you have"" part, which is the crux of the issue. That's like asking miserable people ""Have you tried being happy instead of being unhappy?"" Brilliant. I'm sure you'll be a top contender for the Nobel Happiness Prize this year.",1354813020

I grew up alongside many kids whose parents funneled them into the typical ""dream careers"": doctor, lawyer, finance (and other people who got there on their own). After quickly hitting my head on the (relatively low) glass ceiling, I wondered if I hadn't missed out on huge opportunities in life.<p>I reconnected with one of these friends, and he told me his life wasn't perfect. He hadn't reached some state of perpetual bliss that I'd imagined. And he envied that I got to work on creative problems that provided constant challenge. Then he paid for lunch and drove off in his Porsche. If everyone can be happy or unhappy regardless of material things (as long as their basic needs are met), is it better to be rich and happy rather than middle-class and happy?",1354813014

Compare this to a model under which youd buy standard sweatshirt at the mallsay, this $58 Levis crewneck. The department store likely buys that shirt from Levis for about $30. Levis, in turn, pays the factory about $12 to $15 for it, and the factory likely makes it for $6. So youre paying 10 times what the shirt costs to make, and Levis is earning $18 per garment.

This is particularly true for operations that might do work for companies like Apple.<p>The PCB manufacturers, assemblers, chip makers, connector manufacturers, LED manufacturers, display manufactures, plastics and sheet-metal manufacturers  and more, are all centrally located.  If not, they are within the proximal geographic regions.<p>The same is true of qualified workers.  Need 100,000 assemblers in a hurry?  No problem.  Technicians, engineers, managers, etc.  Lots of them and easy to hire within days of your requirement.<p>In sharp contrast to this, the supply chain anywhere in the US is most-definitely not localized and highly fragmented.  Virtually nothing you are going to use in electronics manufacturing is made in the US.  That means that rather than your LEDs being a few hours away by truck they are three weeks away by boat --from China.<p>In terms of mechanical components, such as screws, well, yes, they are available in the US, of course.  The problem is that they will cost more.  No question about it.  Because our industry, due to the need to survive, has had to focus on market segments that can pay a premium (military, medical, etc.) you can pay through your teeth to get anything made here.  That's just the truth.<p>In terms of machining and bending metal or injecting plastics, well, it depends.  If you are dealing with a unionized operation, forget it.  Costs will be ridiculous.  Plastics, in very large quantities, can be reasonable here.  Punching and bending metal or machining metal could be plausible at a very large scale and with a very finely tuned factory.<p>Let's not add regulatory and tax issues to the pile.<p>Because of all of this and a few more data points from first-hand experience manufacturing in the US, my guess is that Apple is going to simply import pre-fabricated modules assemblies and parts.  They'll have US workers bolt them together and test the finished product.  You can slap a ""Assembled in the US"" (and maybe even ""Made in the US"" sticker on it and feel good about it.<p>Remember what Steve Jobs told Obama about manufacturing jobs coming back to the US.

4882391,comment,4881831,4881831,3,0,Kaivo,,,"I believe that the way we perceive our lives depend on our conception of death. I've always believed that once we die, it's over and we are as unconscious as we were before our birth. Unfortunately, this belief made me see everything pointless to some extent. Regardless of how successful I am, in the end, there's nothing left. Regardless of the sacrifices I do, in the end, there's nothing left. I know that my life might change other people's life, but if in the end, if it doesn't matter for me, it doesn't matter for others either; a sum of 0s returns 0.<p>Since it is not a feeling I enjoy, I ended up living on a daily basis; Have I enjoyed my day, Did I really wanted to do that, What should I do to enjoy my time? I lived mostly in the present for several years, doing a job I enjoyed at the time, and enjoying my time outside as well. Anything that I didn't want to do right away wasn't worth doing. It got to the point where I was pushing away feelings just because I didn't like them, such as regrets or stress from late tasks.<p>It didn't pay that well. After a while, I had a lot of late bills (not that I couldn't pay, I just didn't want to do it right now), I wasn't looking forward to know what to do with my future, etc. The good thing I learned from that is looking forward for good feelings and investing myself in what I enjoy.-Turns out I had a promotion at my job, and I liked my new tasks, and since then, I've been studying at night to build a career from it.-I also learned to fix things up in time because when every thing works out well, when you have nothing due to anyone, you feel better, you feel freed from those responsabilities for the time being.<p>I also believe in balance, in the meaning that if you only have good things happening to you, they aren't actual good things, they are normal neutral things. You need sadness, bad things, to enjoy even more the good things happening. Just like peace doesn't mean anything to someone that doesn't know its counterpart.<p>Put this altogether, you end up with a range from the worst feeling you can have, to a middle, to the greatest feeling you can have. I chose to be near the middle. I don't enjoy having bad feelings, and I prefer to have a neutral life, with good enough feelings. I doesn't mean that I don't want to suffer, to go through rough times, it only means I know to which extent I can go on this range, at which point it's not worth it.<p>Ultimately, living by default or not is, in my vision and understanding, at which point you are ready to sacrifice things to maybe get better things on the other side. Am I ready to sacrifice my marriage to maybe find a better women? Am I ready to dump friendship to maybe get better? I like the place where I live enough, it could be better but do I really want to go through all this work to maybe find something better? I really don't mind living by default, as long as I don't suffer from it, and I currently don't. Maybe I'll have regrets later on, but regrets are not worth having, so I'll chase them away as good as I can.",1354811836

I've liked programming for a long time, but this is the first time I've been passionate about it, and my passion is growing. Now I want to find the kind of job that I'm thrilled about, not just satisfied with. Maybe the answer is to start my own business. Maybe it's simply to join a software-focused one that feels the same way I do. Maybe it's none of the above (indie/OSS development?). I only know that I need to keep moving.<p>I'm not in that great a hurry to leave my current job, and I'm told that such a quick exit isn't good future-planning, anyway. At the same time, I feel anxious to do more than read and tinker. I'm getting ready to start a blog. I'm busily polishing up my first app for release. I bounce my thoughts off anyone who will listen.

So, I think you'll be hard pressed to find one that doesn't open out.  (Again, unless you drop into residential doors.)<p>Your point that we have the knowledge to make doors that are immediately usable is just something I don't believe.  I've seen people use doors incorrectly that fit the guidelines of that book.  Hell, I think I've done so myself.  And, I argue that this is almost completely related to the consistency of how a door opens.  Not the handle.  (e.g., after years of living in a high rise where the entrance opened out and all I did was go to public buildings where all doors open out, not too shockingly, I was more prone to opening house doors incorrectly.)<p>My argument was never that ""so long as it is possible...""  The argument I put forth was more that the cost for getting a door wrong is ridiculously low, so people don't put that much thought into it.  On either side of the isle.  (Well, designers want doors to be pretty.)  Your 90s example is attacking things where the cost was actually high, but the designers didn't care.<p>I think you can basically sum up my viewpoint with the common attack on intuitive designs that nothing is truly intuitive in and of itself.  Pretty much everything is leveraged on something you have previously learned.  If it seems intuitive, it is really just familiar.  In the case of doors, the familiar behaviour trumps any design decisions.  (If you have some good studies against this, by all means I'm game to read them.  More than just the book that started this thread, though.)",1354811010

In some cases the cheap labor offshore was still cheaper than automation, but like most technology automation continues to get cheaper every year while cost of labor goes up.<p>As automation gets cheaper I expect more and more manufacturing that really did move to not just come back to the US, but also new manufacturing to set up shop.  Shipping costs are expensive and it only makes sense to be as close to your customers as possible.  The one exception to this trend will be manufacturing that is inherently 'dirty.'

Deutsche has said publicly that they are interested in liquidating their stake in T-Mobile for some time, and a quasi-leveraged buyout, with the public markets providing capitalization, seems possible.<p>My theory is that MetroPCS essentially did a leveraged buyout of T-Mobile, ASSUMING Deutsche actually exits. Their minority share could potentially become the majority share.<p>This further complicates things in addition to the excellent analysis to which I'm replying :).<p>On the subject of MVNO's, the only major Wholesale carrier left in the US is Sprint and that's also quite interesting. SoftBank, the company which applied significant downward pricing pressure on the Japanese market, just took a 70% interest in Sprint (pending regulatory approval). Assuming this transaction goes through, it could mean that SoftBank wants to lower the retail pricing, and they've publicly made comments indicating this as well.<p>IF that's the case, the lower retail margins will put significant pressure on Sprint's wholesale business. It's impossible to have Retail and Wholesale priced near each other, so the likely conclusion (and what we've seen time and again in the MVNO space) is that the carriers will exercise their capricious will and jack up the rates significantly at the first contract expiration. What happens to all the subscribers that the MVNO had? Converted to the carrier; time and again this has happened.<p>So no, I don't think Google will be an MVNO, it's suicidal on some level to base your primary business on someone else's private enterprise IMHO.",1354810345

It doesn&#x27;t seem like there are downsides now, but in fact there was a fight, and hindsight is 20/20.<p>Do we have proof and data that being over-protective has big downsides? Do we have proof that driving kids to school amounts to being overly protective? Is it really clear cut? Is it possible to be protective about physical safety and lax about social development?

We&#x27;re talking about a <i>bias</i> here, and biases express preferences.  Even among a population of adults &quot;fully equipped to assist&quot; it&#x27;s reasonable to have a <i>preference</i> for women.  Most doctors are &quot;fully equipped to assist&quot; you when you get sick, but some are better than others, and if there were a statistically sound way to pick the better ones, you&#x27;d use that.  It&#x27;s the same exact thing here.<p>> [M]en are fathers, grandpas, brothers, and uncles to little kids. They know how to interact with them.<p><i>I</i> know how to interact with them.  I&#x27;ve got four children myself as well as a niece and a nephew.  As far as I can tell, you&#x27;re making things up as you go along; I&#x27;m actually one of those &quot;fully equipped to assist&quot; men who can and will happily help a lost or scared child.  I&#x27;m friends with many other &quot;fully equipped to assist&quot; men and women who likewise would help a lost or scared child.  As a parent who has to teach my four kids what to do if they&#x27;re lost or scared, I not just reasoning in the abstract about this problem: I&#x27;m looking at the sum total of the people I&#x27;ve seen and making a sound, statistically based decision what to teach my kids.<p>Like you said, if a lost or scared kid approaches me and needs help, I&#x27;m going to make sure they&#x27;re safely handed off to customer service or store security, then I&#x27;m going to go about my business.  It&#x27;s not complicated or hard, and I&#x27;m not going to let it impact my day too much: I&#x27;ll hand off to an authority and move on.  I&#x27;ve got things to do, and I have neither the time nor the inclination to spend more time than I must with someone&#x27;s random lost kid.<p>Contrast that with what my wife would do if approached by a lost or scared kid.  She&#x27;d probably first get the kid to calm down with hugs and tear-wiping.  She&#x27;d introduce him to our kids, find out his name, find out the names of his mommy or daddy, and start tracking down his parents.  She&#x27;d look far and wide to try to track his parents down before even going to the store employee, and if she couldn&#x27;t find them, when she went to the store employee, she&#x27;d probably stay there and comfort the kid until his parents arrived to pick them up.  She&#x27;d move heaven and earth to make sure that kid was reunited with his parents before she left.<p>And you know what?  That difference would manifest in every single father/mother pair I know.  In every case, I know that even though the father would be fully equipped to assist a lost or scared kid, the mom would be better at comforting the kid and would work harder at helping the kid than the dad would.  Heck, one of my friends is a baby/kid/family photographer.  His <i>job</i> is to entertain kids.  Kids love him.  But when I asked him, &quot;Who would do more to help a lost, scared kid in a department store?&quot; he answered without reservation, &quot;My wife.  I&#x27;d just drop the kid off at security.&quot;<p>> But ultimately that is completely besides the point as we&#x27;re talking about someone who has to take a little kid&#x27;s hand and bring them to customer services/store security, we aren&#x27;t asking them to adopt the child.<p>That attitude is <i>exactly</i> why I tell my kids to prefer seeking help from women.  Because statistically speaking they&#x27;ll work harder to help the kid and do a better job of making the kid feel better.  I don&#x27;t care if you or anyone else thinks it&#x27;s a &quot;trope&quot;: it&#x27;s reality, and reality is what I teach my kids.",1452562596

They code, but they don&#x27;t invite feedback on their code. Nor do they compare their code with other people&#x27;s code. So they solve problems, but they never know if their solution was sufficient. They don&#x27;t get better, despite solving problems.<p>Avoid this mistake: When you prep on leetcode.com or some such, read other people&#x27;s solutions line by line, understand and compare. Yes, that takes time.<p>2. They don&#x27;t do mock interviews with practicing engineers<p>Avoid this mistake: Find a friend or mentor who works at a brand name company and do a strictly graded mock interview or two (or more).  That will reveal a lot of things your coding practice won&#x27;t. You could also practice with fellow learners (interview each other), which will help lower the stress in actual interviews (though won&#x27;t be as useful as doing it with a practicing engineer).<p>3. They practice very few problems<p>Avoid this mistake: If you&#x27;re coming from a top-20 4-year CS program, or you have an IQ of 130+, you won&#x27;t need a lot of practice. But for everyone else, don&#x27;t stop until you&#x27;ve practiced at least about 150 problems. Anything less won&#x27;t help and worse, might give you false confidence.<p>And when you&#x27;re in the interview, try asking the interviewer if you can solve the same problem on your computer or on a piece of paper. You&#x27;ll be surprised how many people will let you do it.<p>HTH.",1452562121

That&#x27;s literally a requirement for them to work at all.<p>> Chrome encrypts the password in the SQLite database[0] using Windows&#x27; CryptProtectData() API<p>If its encrypted, then its not plaintext. Its ciphertext. In infosec lingo plaintext specifically refers to the unencrypted and otherwise unaltered original information.",1452560484

I&#x27;m sure there is a solid library out there for things like replace(), but it seems silly for everyone to possibly be using separate libraries<p>It&#x27;s not that bad, there are other languages which have this problem - you can see exactly the same situation in JS-land, for example. It would be much worse if not for quicklisp. I think quicklisp and asdf are among the best package distribution tools: I feel it&#x27;s better than pip and gem and similar to npm. Installing a library is literally a single line in your code. There&#x27;s the problem with finding the package you need and it&#x27;s harder than with JS and npm, but doable.<p>BTW: what do you do to learn CL? I&#x27;m using StumpWM as my window manager and I think it&#x27;s one of the best ways of learning CL. With SLIME, then, you get almost Lisp-only environment, especially if you use Emacs for your other editing too. I wrote a couple of blog posts[1] about StumpWM and posted my config on GitHub[2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://klibert.pl/posts/stumpwm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://klibert.pl/posts/stumpwm.html</a> <a href=""https://klibert.pl/output/stumpwm-better-modeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://klibert.pl/output/stumpwm-better-modeline.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/piotrklibert/stumpwm-config/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/piotrklibert/stumpwm-config/</a>",1452560415

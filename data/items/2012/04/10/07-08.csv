In my opinion, detecting and defusing more of these issues sooner rather than later is a good thing.<p>Personally, I'm reminded me of the issues I run into when writing cross-platform code (or code that needs to work with multiple versions of tools and libraries). The upfront effort to multiple environments (or the effort required to add the new environment) is usually significant, but I'd say the improvement in code/software quality is an often unrecognized benefit (over and above the reason you're supporting the new environment in the fist place).",1334044561

Theres PHP itself, but nothing that acts as a big interpolator rather than a program.</i><p>As if that was a bug and not a feature. PHP succeeds because <i>there is one PHP templating syntax and it is called ""PHP""</i>.<p>PHP started life as a templating language, and that's where its soul lies. Which is important, because if a non-programmer wants to start editing dynamic HTML pages, most likely the first thing they open in their text editor will be a template. And if a customer wants to change the website, but doesn't want to pay a highly-trained programmer (we're very expensive, especially because none of us really wants to be paid to edit templates all day), they'll hire someone who knows how to edit the theme. For every seasoned programmer in the world, there are half a dozen themers who know how to edit HTML and CSS, and maybe how to embed a ""foreach"" loop that calls a stock WordPress function, or edit an argument list, or swap one Drupal function name for another. And for every themer there's a dozen non-programmers who dream of knowing enough to be themers.<p>This class of user is what every other platform tends to neglect. Ruby and Python programmers tend to design tools that are intuitive to other programmers. We build ""frameworks"", where one must tinker and monkey-patch and fork to such a degree that only another programmer can <i>download and assemble</i> a working system, let alone customize it. (One word: <i>Gemfiles</i>.) We write programmer-centric documentation filled with jargon terms from Javaschool, like ""object"". (PHP themers often do not understand OO, and often don't need to. This, all by itself, could be why PHP is so popular.) But one leaves a lot of money on the table when one designs software systems exclusively for users whose programming education entitles them to six-figure salaries. There aren't <i>enough</i> such people on earth; that's why they earn six-figure salaries.<p>Designing the minimum viable product for borderline-non-programmers who want to tinker with dynamic web pages is <i>hard work</i>, though. PHP evolved into that niche, but if you don't start there it's hard to steer there deliberately. For me, trying to remember when object inheritance and version control and function definitions were mysterious is like trying to remember when I didn't understand algebra. (And, believe me, I <i>really</i> didn't understand, once. But I'll be damned if I can remember why not.) It's so hard to keep one's eye on that ball that even the PHP developers lost the plot long ago: PHP has long since bulked up with features borrowed from other languages. But if you ignore its newer features the soul of PHP is still a little templating language that you can edit into the HTML on your server; change a filename extension and reload and you're good to go. And, the thing is: You can write a crazy-complicated core system in PHP, but then expose it as an API at the template layer, and those tinkerers hacking at the HTML on their servers will be able to use it.",1334041850

Replaying that old record doesn't add anything to What We Already Know.<p>Also: I didn't say that Javascript is different - I'm talking about the curmudgeons in comp.lang.js who argue that the practical benefits of using a JS library are outweighed by their flaws. This is clearly dis-proven by their popularity and demonstrable <i>economic benefit</i>. As for PHP, this remains true.",1334041653

If you're trying to run a lean startup with only three backend people like Instagram these effects are very important. Those three engineers could have coded something <i>similar</i> in PHP but I'll guarantee you it wouldn't have been as good.<p>Facebook can afford to throw money at the problem and nobody's really trying to compete with Wikipedia so they can get away with it.",1334041615
3821114,comment,3820431,3820855,6,0,pbiggar,,,"There used to be a generally accepted answer, which is that there were languages, and there were implementations of languages, and that those were separate things. C++ was not g++, and vice versa.<p>But the lines got very much blurred by the rise of scripting languages, in which - typically - the language was defined by the implementation. So for a few years there, it really was difficult to tell whether this was Python or CPython.<p>Fortunately, nearly all the languages to which this applies matured and got new implementations. Rubyists often to refer to the C ruby implementation as MRI (Matz' ruby interpreter), and there are lots of different Ruby implementations now. Python went out of its way to document behaviour which was specific to CPython, and put a lot of weight behind Unladen Swallow and Pypy.<p>But your Java example is bonkers. Compiling Java to native is still Java, its just not JVM. Compiling clojure to JVM is just JVM. The language feature is not the language. In Java's case, the language is specified, the VM is specified, the bytecode is specified. There really should be no ambiguity at all there.",1334041614

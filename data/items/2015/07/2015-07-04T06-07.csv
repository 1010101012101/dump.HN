Have you ever had to hassle about what&#x27;s fair to put in a lease? Probably not, since the legal system provides for a pretty rigid API between landlords and tenants. The world we live in is a large series of such APIs, which are constantly and modified via our political and legal systems. The space ICs operate in simply does not have such rules nor anyone to enforce them.<p>In a world where information is power and without a justice enforcer more powerful than the actors, an unknown leaker is significantly more of a threat than an allied IC. An ally will keep your secrets, and mutual secret-keeping reinforces alliances [1]. Journalists, on the other hand, are the gossip queens of the information trade, as they reap their rewards by telling secrets to everyone without much regard for when it&#x27;s convenient. They are useful only as long as their access can be controlled.<p>The entry points NSA/CIA used are being watched by them, or maybe even honeypotted.

When it&#x27;s special purpose, there&#x27;s no need to use generics.<p>When I needed a generic data structure in C, I would do code generation (but only after I&#x27;d have a use for it in more than one place). The number of times I ever needed to do this for anything other than an array or hashtable is (not really surprisingly) vanishingly small.<p>So, coming from the perspective of Go is a better C (that avoids the mistakes of C++), this choice makes sense to me. I don&#x27;t necessarily think it&#x27;s the right choice -- I think generally generics are useful, but tend to use generic functions in my C++ code more than generic types or containers.<p>Might be worth noting that I work in game development, where using a library data structure isn&#x27;t really considered for most things, because a special purpose one is likely able to be higher performance, due to assumptions it&#x27;s able to make, operations it doesn&#x27;t need to implement, etc. I guess I can see the situation where not being able to find an off the shelf generic data structure is frustrating, but I think it might be <i>a bit</i> overblown.",1435992208

The graphics and sound, probably inspired by the Amiga, were awesome in the era! So many elements of modern RTS were already present: multiple civilizations, each with specialist unit types. Level-oriented progression. Resource harvesting. Terrain types. Unit speed as a key differentiator. High level weapons with the capacity for massive remote destruction. NPCs on the map.

I&#x27;m one of the people who likes long, in-depth articles, so I make a forum for people to post and discuss long, in-depth articles. 10% of the cat-picture-lovers happen upon my forum and are delighted to see a new place that they can post cat pictures. My 149 friends and I downvote these cat pictures with all our hearts, but we simply can&#x27;t outvote the 1000 cat-picture-lovers. Even worse, a cat-picture-lover can look at and upvote a hundred cat pictures in the time it takes me to read one long-form article, so the content that the forum is intended for is buried before even the 150 long-content-lovers get to see it. So the complete destruction of my long-article forum happens organically and by consensus, just like karma systems are supposed to work -- but it&#x27;s not a desirable outcome!<p>Basically, karma systems are good at finding something that some group of people will like, but if that&#x27;s all you want, subreddits are a bad idea, because the entire point of them is to focus on a particular thing and exclude other things that very likely more people would like to see.<p>Like I said, all the true* subreddits show that there are people who want to have more focused subreddits. The idea that focus should be impossible if a sufficient number of people who are don&#x27;t have that focus stumble upon the subreddit just doesn&#x27;t seem very reasonable to me.",1435990429

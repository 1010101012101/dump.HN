There are loads of women in biotech (another field I&#x27;ve studied), and trust me it is no easier than this one. There are more women in <i>aerospace</i>, in <i>actual rocket science</i>.

It has the effect of shifting innovation from being a fixed costed cost-centre, to being a variable cost with more potential for profit. As we can see from Uber&#x27;s announcement that they want to buy university robotics departments, innovation can be reincorporated if it has a potential return. It&#x27;s definitely a change in the innovation landscape.",1443370817

Plus it gives you an incentive to be more active and the watch can annoy you if you&#x27;re letting it die by being sedentary. But both the Citizen-style &quot;eco drive&quot; and the Seiko-style kinetic drive could be baked into the same watch. That&#x27;s plenty of energy for the deep low power microcontrollers that exist these days, even a fairly powerful ARM-based one.<p>But that&#x27;s still not enough power to drive the screen on most &quot;smartwatches&quot;. Nor their higher power cellular/wifi components.<p>Fact of the matter is, TFT screens eat batteries like no-one&#x27;s business. No avoiding it. E-ink screens would do better, but have nighttime visibility problems that would be hard to overcome.<p>Plain and simple, the undoing of the smart watch is the battery. It&#x27;s an obstacle we may someday overcome, but until that day, it&#x27;s not likely to catch on and become the big hit everyone wants it to be.",1394373495

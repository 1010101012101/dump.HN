And that would not be the Surface. I&#x27;m thinking something with a proper Internet based OS. Some new variant of Windows that plays well with their online services like Outlook.com and Office 360.

It&#x27;s better to keep your mouth shut, don&#x27;t complain or antagonize, they are not going to change for you or anybody (they haven&#x27;t in centuries). Give them the little self importance they crave for and <i>get from them what you want</i> (grades, diploma). Of course, keep your mind critical but keep it to yourself until they give you what you want.<p>Also don&#x27;t overwork yourself, perhaps this is not the best time to spend many hours doing unrelated programming or research. It can be a distraction to your education goal. We have limited willpower, try to avoid depletion. Only when you achieve your studying goals for the day you get to do your own thing. Study in the mornings, play in the afternoons.<p>Modifying your routine takes a while, do it in baby steps. Remove all temptations that might get in the way to your goals until you achieve them. But keep a good chunk of the day to clean up your head.<p>Of course, YMMV.",1393095542

I totally support a game developer&#x27;s right to make money off their work, but the way these games aim to do that is so unethical.<p>Remember how fun games used to be before they were perverted by the greedy in-app purchasing tactics? I&#x27;m sure there weren&#x27;t many games making a million dollars a day like Candy Crush, but with a classic game like Civilization you come to respect the genius of Sid Meiers. What&#x27;s more important to you, a million dollars a day or the respect and admiration of the gaming community? It seems like an insatiable appetite for wealth, driven by the example of successful in-app purchasing games like Candy Crush, has been instilled in the game development community.<p>One more thing - when your performance in a game depends largely on how much money you spend on it, the value of actually being good at the game is basically nothing. How am I to know that the top players in the world didn&#x27;t just drop a couple grand on the power ups and gold and whatever other virtual shit they try to peddle. In games like Civilization, the only way to win at the deity level was to be a bad ass motherfucker who doesn&#x27;t take shit from any other civ - if Civilization was invented today, you would be converting your real money into virtual gold during those economic crunch times in a war campaign.<p>Back in the day, it took a genius to make a financially successful game. Nowadays, it just takes an in-app purchasing API. I hope people stop paying the people who game human emotions for personal profit and start paying the geniuses who make great games.",1393094990

If this class of statements has any analogue in the empirical sciences, I guess it must be &quot;unscientific&quot; (untestable) hypotheses, about which philosophers (or theoretical physicists) might still find interesting things to say.<p>Mathematicians also use the word &quot;hypothesis&quot; to refer to a whole implication in the phrase &quot;inductive hypothesis&quot;. But it most often simply means the left side of an implication: the phrase &quot;A is true by hypothesis&quot; means that A was assumed to be true—that is, it was the starting point of a proof.<p>0. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis</a>",1393094638

        if((charPtr + 2) > endCp) {

        sigAlg.signature = *charPtr++;
    }
</code></pre>
is only executed in the TLS 1.2 case, but the sigAlg structure is always on the stack. So if this code remains &quot;skipped&quot; in the non-TLS 1.2 case, then later on:<p><pre><code>    if (sslVersionIsLikeTls12(ctx))
    {
        err = SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchangeTls12(ctx, sigAlg, signedParams,

the broken &quot;else&quot; case can be replaced with instructions to poke the proper values into sigAlg and then relative jmp to the code offset where the inlined SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchangeTls12 begins (0x86cb9), as that version of the function does not have the bug.<p>I checked inside the SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange disassembly and the compiler expectedly omitted the remainder of the function, so it isn&#x27;t as simple as sticking a few nops in.",1393094272

It&#x27;s called Org-mode, and it is part of Emacs, although that shouldn&#x27;t scare you off immediately; I&#x27;ll talk more about that shortly, but first want to mention some features you might find appealing. You can write LaTeX documents in it if you like, or you can write Org-mode documents in a far more humane syntax, which the editor understands on a semantic level, and which can incorporate LaTeX snippets where they&#x27;re needed while otherwise insulating you from having to write LaTeX source by hand. (Although of course you can if you want to.)<p>Org-mode has exporters for LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), HTML, DocBook, PDF (via DocBook), various flavors of plain text, OpenDocument text (which can get you to Word if you want to go there), all of which work quite well; if you need to supply LaTeX source as input to some external pipeline, Org makes it possible for you to do so. On the other hand, if you prefer to spend as little time as possible dealing with raw LaTeX, which in my experience seems like a sensible attitude to take, Org makes that possible as well. And on the third hand, if you need to write LaTeX source directly for complex diagrams and such, or if you want to override the way Org generates LaTeX in specific cases but let it handle the rest of a document on its own, Org doesn&#x27;t get in your way there, either.<p>You can also include code snippets in an Org-mode file, of arbitrary length and in arbitrary languages. If they&#x27;re in a language Emacs understands, you can have it render them with syntax highlighting, but that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg; you can also have Org-mode <i>execute</i> those snippets, whether ad hoc or as part of the compilation process, and it can incorporate their results into the document verbatim or after a variety of transformations, and also use those results as input to other code snippets in the same document. This is why the literate programming folks love Org-mode as much as they do; there&#x27;s nothing quite like it for interweaving text and code and then being easily able to do interesting things with both.<p>And, although Emacs is by far the most powerful editor for Org-mode files, there&#x27;s nothing saying you <i>have</i> to use Emacs to edit Org-mode files. You can, for example, use Vim to write your Org-mode source, probably with some degree of highlighting via some vimscript file or other. You can then invoke Emacs in batch mode to compile your Org source into whatever format you want to come out the other end, without ever having to see or deal with the Emacs editor interface, and without having to involve yourself save on the most superficial level with Emacs Lisp. (I&#x27;ll be happy to provide the general form of such an invocation, if you&#x27;re interested; let me know.)",1393094249

The only reason to use the &quot;goto fail;&quot; idiom is to free two buffers before returning.  But the buffers in question are just sslBuffer structs that live on the local stack.  Their destructors will be called, in reverse order, regardless of how the function is exited.  If this code simply had a fucking destructor for sslBuffer to delete the data pointer, none of the rest of these call sites for SSLFreeBuffer would need to exist at all!  And there&#x27;s 24 such call sites in this file alone.  Anyone with any sense would chose the 2-line destructor over dozens of calls to free buffers.<p>There&#x27;s even this bullshit:<p><pre><code>    if ((err = SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx)) != 0)\n        goto fail;\n</code></pre>\nWhich is hilarious, because the only way for SSLFreeBuffer to fail is if the buffer doesn&#x27;t exist, but hashCtx is a local temporary object and it MUST exist.  Anyway the only thing we do by jumping to fail is to free the non-existent object once again.<p>In short: wow.",1393092640

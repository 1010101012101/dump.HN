Our prices are indeed higher, but the services are better than competitors and we actually provide more value per price unit. Please, take this into consideration.&quot;<p>And maybe that&#x27;s just my tastes, but negative commenting on competitors with all that &quot;race to the bottom&quot; and &quot;customers are switching in droves&quot; stuff doesn&#x27;t sound any good to me.

Early-stage startup teams cannot afford to handle the hardware fragmentation that plagues Android.<p>You have a full stack of iOS devices, too, maybe even more expensive. It&#x27;s a point if you develop quite near hardware features or want to do pixel-perfect designs without auto-layout, but that&#x27;s difficult for iOS, too, these days. A messenger app is really not that device specific.<p>> 2. Study after study demonstrates iOS users are not only growing in key geographies, but are more valuable customers.<p>If it&#x27;s about hype and money, you might be right, but if you just need users with a much more social diversity, Android is likely on your side.<p>> 3. iPhone 5c and future low cost models will likely steal share from Android relative to yesterday.\nDunno. You say &quot;likely&quot;, too, so why is that even considered as a top 3 argument?<p>Nevertheless, the most important point here is: It&#x27;s a messenger. For teams. You don&#x27;t want split between iOS and Android devices and Talko itself sees this as negative point:<p>> (The corporate beta testers I spoke with sighed wistfully when reporting that a couple of team members could not participate because they didn’t use iPhones.) “We can’t build a business on this until we have all of the above,” says Ozzie, who wanted to make sure his engineers aced the iPhone first; [...]<p>iMessage&#x27;s strength is its SMS fallback (still, who wants to send expensive text messages these days), but Facebook, WhatsApp etc. are generally much more used.",1411556590

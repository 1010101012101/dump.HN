What you do is look until you seem to have a reliable money maker, lever up and bet big. If it all pans out - as it usually does - you pocket a big chunk of the profit. If it fails (which it will once every few years or decades), you get the government to bail you out, or at worst the company goes bust.<p>Heads you win (most of the time), tails you don't lose much. It's a money-making (or rather, money-diverting) ratchet.<p>The feedback mechanisms don't work properly, particularly in finance. Humans don't live long enough and don't defer compensation long enough for the averages to work out properly. When a large proportion of the economy is devoted to this stuff (20+% in some countries), it's almost certainly highly inefficient, but the market won't fix it because the market <i>can't</i> fix it: again, the feedback mechanisms aren't strong enough.",1317272012

The first is that you can declare something to be in the public domain and put it into the public domain. The second is that declaring something to be in the public domain (even without an affadavit) forms a reliable estoppel in case the author wants to exercise his copyright later.

Lua supports coroutines, so a function can just yield. Here's a brief example:<p><pre><code>    -- Query a database using an http backend.\n    -- Yields and handles other requests until the reply is complete.\n    local record = util.getUserRecord(userId)\n\n    -- Send some text to the client. Yields control while\n    -- the actual transfer is in progress.\n    ngx.print( ""Result="" )\n    \n    -- Send the result, encoded as JSON, to the client\n    -- Again, this call doesn't block the server.\n    ngx.print( cjson.encode(result) )\n    \n</code></pre>\nWith code like the above I can easily handle into the thousands of concurrent connections per second on the lowest end Linode VPS node available, with barely any load on the box -- and I'm told it should be able to handle 40k+ connections per second, if I were to do any tuning. Oh, and I have only 512Mb of RAM, which it doesn't even get close to under load. And the longest request took less than 500ms at high load.<p>I've been using OpenResty [1] which has the Lua module and a bunch of others all configured together. Works great, and I can't complain about the performance.<p>Someday I'm sure I'll hand the maintenance of this off, and then I might regret not using one of the ""popular"" frameworks. But the code is SO straightforward using this stack -- and what I'm using it for is so simple -- I think not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openresty.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openresty.org/</a>",1317270399

3051102,comment,3050462,3050462,2,0,clavalle,,,"These are ubiquitous technologies.  You are going to get flooded in enough waste that 20 mere questions, no matter how clever, are not going to help you too much.<p>First, find a developer whose sole job is to help you hire other developers, preferably a friend or someone you trust.  They don't even have to necessarily be experts in, say, MYSQL or anything else you have listed there.  Great embedded C dev?  Great!  Java master?  Fantastic.  Great news is that this person is not going to be doing any developing for you whatsoever so you can take on someone who has a day job without worrying about IP issues or anything...<p>Now, you are not going to want to waste their time (and your money...you should definitely pay your consultant and don't rely on favors) so step two is to put out requirements for some piece of functionality you need done.  Ask for portfolios and resumes (but take them with a big grain of salt) and pick some with your consultant that seem to fit the bill.  Pay the cash and let them get cracking.  DON""T try to get them to do any work or take a test for free to prove themselves.  That is a sure way to skim the cream off the top and get left with the dregs.  If you can't come up with requirements, you've got bigger problems.  By the way, this is a good place to shake your acquaintance tree...let it be known that you are looking for people to pick up small projects that could lead to a more lasting relationship.<p>Review and test their work.  Pick out a few with the help of your consultant that seem to write good, functional code on time and with good communication.  It is possible to have some major stand-outs here.  If so, you might want to jump on them but try not to get too excited.<p>Now that you have your finalists, give them a larger task...perhaps a tougher technical problem if your needs drift in that direction or, more likely, requirements that are not fully realized.  Have them email each other copying you on everything, as part of a team...pay attention to how they communicate with each other and hash things out.  Who's having the ideas?  Who is happy to coast and let others drive?  Who's a bully? etc...  THIS IS KEY!  This is going to separate the merely good developers from the real value creators.  If you end up with a bunch of people constantly begging for direction or flip flopping on every issue on how to proceed, you need to cast a wider net and start from the beginning armed with that much more experience.  It might seem expensive but not half as expensive as anchoring yourself to the mediocre.  That being said, keep the solid followers in mind when you need to fill gaps with freelancers. Ditch the bad attitudes and low performers and keep your value generators -- the key performers -- the stand outs that work well, create solid deliverables that make you very happy and work well together.<p>Treat your people well, rinse and repeat as you grow (shaking your team's talent tree as you do).<p>Good Luck!",1317269777

The most visible example of this was the number of women present. I <i>personally</i> know many times more women in technology than I saw in that entire crowd of a thousand or so.<p>I know that YC is going to appeal to a certain sort of person, but I would've been much more impressed with the whole event if it had been apparent that the organizers had gone just a little bit out of their way to reach out to different kinds of people who work in technology in the city. There are so many, doing so many amazing things, coming from so many backgrounds. Get people together who don't normally talk and see what new ideas start forming.<p>If NYC has any chance of outranking the Bay Area when it comes to start-ups, it's going to be because the NYC scene learns how to leverage the extreme diversity of talent out here. Not because a thousand young, male nerds get in the same room together to talk about the same stuff they all just read on Hacker News.<p>Anyway. That's my rant.

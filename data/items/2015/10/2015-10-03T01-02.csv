They have very high taxes on the middle class, relatively low taxes on the rich ( via various loop holes and investment tax breaks ) and restrictions on who can go to free college.  So, if you want to copy German or Swedish system, then be honest that it will require middle class taxation double of what it is now.

Among other positions we are looking for an iOS developer that can drive our product and code base to a totally new level.<p>World-class companies (Apple, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences. Our platform already includes a mobile solution covering both Android and iOS users, providing them the ability to engage with customers in real-time, share aggregated data, or analyze customer feedback on-the-go.<p>We want to take this platform to the next stage, by increasing the social aspect of our application to make it a vital part of our client&#x27;s organization, and by increasing its the personalization capabilities, so each one of our users can tailor it to their particular needs and goals. We also want to experiment on innovative ways of capturing customer experience information, and on helping companies to engage their employees on a customer oriented culture.<p>For that we&#x27;ve started playing with new frameworks and technologies such React Native, Flux and Graph QL in order to make our development more agile, extensible and simple. This is posible given that we won&#x27;t need to recompile every time after a change, that we can have a server with the app&#x27;s content (we don&#x27;t have to wait for apples review) and that we can reuse existing javascript libraries that work great.<p>Please contact me at jmrodriguez@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Juan Manuel Rodriguez, iOS Software Engineer.",1443837320

10322288,comment,10319698,10320605,0,0,grayclhn,,,"I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding. Standard basic (measure-theoretic) probability theory is designed to handle common non-discrete real-world cases: continuous random variables like height, temperature, etc. They&#x27;re not approximated by something countable; instead theorems proving that they have the sort of behavior you&#x27;d want are established by proving them for a countable approximation, then taking limits. It is exactly like integration: prove things for step functions, then make the steps infinitely thin. The theory is clean and straightforward.<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets less basic: say you want to look at temperature over time, but you don&#x27;t want to model temperature as a variable that&#x27;s measured daily, or hourly, or even every second (secondly?), but you want to model it as a process that evolves in continuous time. That&#x27;s where the theory gets messy. Not necessarily at the level of a <i>user</i> of this theory, but definitely at the level of <i>proving that the math you want to use is allowed</i>.<p>If you actually need an introduction to that sort of probability, Lawrence Evans (Berkeley) has some old lecture notes aimed at undergrads [1] that he turned into a book [2]. If (more likely) you want standard measure-theoretic probability theory (as opposed to what&#x27;s taught to undergraduates), David Pollard&#x27;s book is pretty good [3].<p>I&#x27;m sure that @graycat will scoff at those recommendations, but his reading list would be considered excessively hardcore and time consuming even for a graduate student in math, which I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.416.1184&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.416...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Stochastic-Differential-Equations/dp/1470410540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Stochastic-Differentia...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Theoretic-Probability-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521002893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Theoretic-Probability-Statistical-Prob...</a><p>ps: after looking at it again, the intro in Evans&#x27;s notes is as gentle as it&#x27;s going to get, so start there.

A lot of the time you spend in Kindergarten is purely socializing and playing with other children.<p>If there are groups, then only so that the <i>educators</i> (not teachers) don&#x27;t get overwhelmed. Children are grouped randomly and stay in one group for as long as they go to Kindergarten, so you have children from 3 up to 7 in one group.<p>The activities that are organized or structured in any way are eating, sleeping, singing, getting told stories, making things out of paper like lanterns, a few physical activities and of course activities that happen outside of the Kindergarten.<p>Kindergärten exist and are important not to learn math but to learn to interact with other people, to make friends and to be a child until you are mature enough to handle a school environment. That means that while typically a child is enrolled in school with 6, some also enroll a year earlier or later depending on the child.",1443835996

Obviously it was to their (and everyone&#x27;s) disadvantage for them to become economically depending on manufacturing death.  They have nobody but themselves to blame.<p>My home town is one of these, and it&#x27;s already pretty depressed.  We&#x27;ll all be happier after the pivot to an economy based on building things that aren&#x27;t destructive and idiotic.<p>Other than this, I agree with every point you&#x27;ve made.",1443834441

The decisions of millions of people to live far away from where they work has created this situation where they all have to spend hours sitting in traffic. Maybe individually it&#x27;s worthwhile to each person, but collectively it&#x27;s wasting billions of hours and countless gallons of gas. The tolls are merely trying to align the financial incentives with reality. In other words, move so you don&#x27;t have to sit in traffic or pay the toll.",1443834287

I find it&#x27;s great to get something up and running, but I&#x27;ve found myself hitting limitations, especially when it comes to custom design. But it&#x27;s possible I may just be using it ineffectively. I always assumed that one day I should port my company&#x27;s charts over to D3 if we wanted to be <i>serious</i> about our data visualization (which makes up a big part of our site).<p>In other words, is it like Bootstrap in that it&#x27;s a useful starting tool, but doesn&#x27;t really scale well if you want to have full design control in the longrun? Do you happen to know any notable sites using Highcharts? Thanks in advance.",1443834241

For instance, Einstein stating that his theory was correct, even if the first test didn&#x27;t agree. I thought this was pretty well accepted.

For one client I think he visited every office in the country over the course of one fall for an upgrade project.  I don&#x27;t think he ran a net profit, but he probably paid quite a few expenses.  He said something once about 3piece business suits and RVs don&#x27;t mix very well.<p>All I remember of his advice on this topic was private parks are completely deserted during the week during the school year, and there are public parks in the middle of nowhere for the weekends.<p>I have been to private campgrounds (as a tent camper) and even in season during the summer, the difference between 3pm Thursday and 3pm Saturday is spectacular.<p>The airstream sounds like fun, have a good time!

6390465,comment,6389498,6389498,3,0,samatman,,,"Worth mentioning for HN: There is a field of critical studies devoted to code, called critical code studies. A friend of the author directed me to this paper, which, somewhat unexpectedly, I found excellent:<p><a href=""http://thoughtmesh.net/publish/367.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thoughtmesh.net/publish/367.php</a><p>Here&#x27;s the abstract:<p>&quot;This is an investigation into some aspects of the way the C programming language creates meaning. In any formalized language, meaning is created by a tension between a community of speakers and the language&#x27;s formal definition. In the case of C, this community preceded and presided over the formal definition in such a way that the formal definition itself embodies this tension. Because of this, C has a relatively unique view on how programming languages work, and how language in general should work. Specifically, I will argue that the 1989 ANSI C standard introduces the concept of abstraction by ambiguity into formal language specifications. Paradoxically, this ambiguity allows the knowledgeable programmer to be more specific than would otherwise be possible, while retaining the extensional benefits of abstraction. This has implications for philosophy of language in general, which I will briefly address.<p>&quot;This work is situated in the emerging field of critical code studies (Marino). Although there has been related work dating all the way back into the 80s and 90s (Knuth; Winograd; Landow; Kittler), most studies that self-consciously look at code itself from a perspective that goes beyond computer science are a very recent phenomenon (Fuller; Chun). If much of my investigation seems overly broad, then, that&#x27;s to be expected: just as a Polaroid photograph develops with broad splotches of color, only acquiring precision at the end of the process, likewise a new investigation must be satisfied with the faith that its clumsiness will be turned into precision with time. Many things herein are assertions with little corresponding argument, yet assertions which nevertheless to me seemed interesting enough to present for consideration in the hope that they might function as depth-soundings for future navigation.&quot;",1379282253

6390463,comment,6388512,6389245,2,0,pron,,,"<i>This may be a reflection of the fact that people who write code, but are not really programmers, lack sufficient domain knowledge (in the field of programming) to choose anything other than the &quot;default&quot; choice.</i><p>While this could <i>sometimes</i> be the case, that&#x27;s mostly because they have other things to think about. Spending time on choosing and learning new languages (with their libraries and communities) can be rightly considered a manufacturing optimization. That&#x27;s really important to people whose job it is to manufacture at scale, but not necessarily to those dreaming up new components. These are two different jobs. When you deal with manufacturing, you&#x27;re expected to spend a lot of energy on picking the absolute best tools. But if you&#x27;re handcrafting something completely different from most of what&#x27;s out there, your tools and process don&#x27;t matter as much. The path doesn&#x27;t need to be optimal if you&#x27;re the first to take it to a new destination. If you don&#x27;t know if you can even get to where you&#x27;re going  or if there&#x27;s anything there at all  spending money on the best shoes is a premature and unnecessary optimization.",1379282229

6390461,comment,6389165,6389700,1,0,lightsidelabs,,,"One trouble is that the &quot;idea&quot; you&#x27;ve just communicated isn&#x27;t actually the idea behind linear regression. The idea behind regression is this.<p>You&#x27;re trying to make a prediction for some number you care about - let&#x27;s say the value of a given stock price. You&#x27;ve come up with a set of hypotheses about which characteristics might help you make that prediction. Moreover, you have a set of examples that you&#x27;ve witnessed in the past, and you want to learn from that experience.<p>Using linear regression, you can <i>test</i> those hypotheses. You turn those characteristic features into a quantifiable number themselves. Linear regression is simply the name we give to the process of testing whether there&#x27;s any validity to your hypothesis. If that hypothesis is true and you&#x27;ve discovered what makes the stock go up, then the corresponding feature will be given a high absolute coefficient. You&#x27;ll also know whether it&#x27;s an indicator of the stock going up or down, based on the sign of that coefficient. There&#x27;s no math involved - you&#x27;re testing your own intuition about how to make predictions.<p>The idea behind linear regression isn&#x27;t &quot;finding a line that fits a scatter plot.&quot; That&#x27;s still math and it&#x27;s still unhelpful to many people with serious, real-world applications. It&#x27;s just an abstraction of the math that happens to leave out the formal representation.<p>To really communicate ideas in application, you need to move past the math entirely, and get to how it ties into people&#x27;s judgments about data that they know well and have experience with, and show them that the intuition they can bring to the table is valuable (for feature determination). Otherwise, even scatter plots will often shut people out, because they &quot;aren&#x27;t good at math.&quot;",1379282205

Owning a quasi-monopoly is also not illegal.<p>I find people are often extremely confused about anti-trust law and the actual laws (and relative lack thereof) related to monopolies.<p>Microsoft is not operating under a government consent decree any longer.<p>Microsoft using Windows to compete with Dropbox is not inherently illegal. It has absolutely nothing to do with market-share, it has to do with whether the government, on a case-by-case basis, decides that a company&#x27;s actions caused harm, and it is purely a subjective decision.<p>Anti-trust law, I&#x27;ll note, does not specifically or exclusively govern monopolies.

It preaches equality N. says and only a slave or an underling would preach equality and they do so because they have less than their masters. So in that way it is a self-interested morality (if you accept it was advocated by an underclass). He contrasts this with a master morality (might is right basically).<p>What is ethics or morality? It&#x27;s what values you hold and project onto the world, correct? So I guess N. is saying that these values are subject to your socio-economic place in the world. That&#x27;s quite materialist -- like Marx, who said more or less the same thing except that Marx said that the material conditions of your (as a class) existence shape your ideology. I think the text to look at for N. is &quot;On The Genealogy of Morals&quot; and the text for Marx is &quot;The German Ideology&quot;.<p>Regarding the provenance of deconstruction.

6390448,comment,6388431,6388431,6,0,zmmmmm,,,"I truly don&#x27;t understand what MS finds so hard about backup. What people want is so simple and obvious - a separate copy of all their files, preferably their whole system image, somewhere else. And yet every version of Windows seems to screw around with it. I remember Vista came out and I thought a great way to migrate would be to do a full system backup and then I could restore back the personal files I wanted onto Vista. Nope - the backup system totally changed, the utiltity to restore files didn&#x27;t even ship with Vista! I was left to manually use an old XP computer to extract and copy files across from my backup image.<p>Then Win7 came and I started using the backup option there. But even with the full drive image I didn&#x27;t quite trust it, so I also made intermittent backups using Macrium Reflect which creates a low level image of each partition. So then came the day when my wife chose the &quot;recover my pc&quot; from the boot menu and wiped everything. &quot;No problem!&quot; I thought, I will just Google how to restore a full system image to bare metal. Imagine my shock to discover that this is not a feature of Windows backup. Unless you make a &quot;recovery disk&quot; using a CD (this computer did not have a CD drive), you cannot reinstall a full system image!? So I installed from the Macrium partition image and it delightfully brought back our system in a matter of minutes.<p>I&#x27;ve never been able to work out if this consistent incompetence is by design (to keep the industry of alternative backup solutions alive and avoid accusations of monoply / antitrust) or if they have some strategic or tactical reason to make sure noboby on windows manages to back up their computers (hey, 20% of all users who corrupt their hard drive just buy a new computer!)<p>Whatever the reason, it is exacty this sort of thing that is driving regular consumers away from Windows and into the arms of Apple.

The problem, however, is that its sillier adherentswho are all over universitiestake a misreading of Saussure Deconstruction to mean that nothing means anything [...]<p>Surely the point is that the meaning of the text is dependant on the context supplied by the reader.  So for an analysis of a text to a mean something (rather than nothing) is must not only define the subset of readers it is confined too, but also offer some justification of why it assumes those readers supply a common context (and what that common context is).<p>Without this context an analysis of a text is a largely a polemic unless the analysis is so absurd (or dissident) that it becomes a satire.

They were all culture related, personality-based, &quot;how will you fit with our team&quot; type. Young, scrappy kind of team, who didn&#x27;t believe in big corporation-type interviews.<p>Well, the interview in question came. I&#x27;m a rockstar when it comes to interviews. I&#x27;m personable, confident, funny, and I carry myself really well in conversation. But what was different?<p>The guy I interviewed with previously held a position with Microsoft.<p>And he did things the Microsoft way.<p>I&#x27;m nothing but a loose guy. I don&#x27;t have the college education to back me. I hadn&#x27;t worked on any famed projects. I didn&#x27;t commit to open-source projects, have a network to vouch for me. I had a few side projects, but they were nothing more than me just building things. I owned a few companies in my mid-late teens that sold for a good amount of money, but nothing I&#x27;d write home about. I&#x27;m a utility player that can wear many hats: front-end, back-end, sysadmin, marketing, advertising, copywriting, legal stuff, financials, client management, databases... I don&#x27;t do any one thing particularly well (except for maybe back-end) but I do all of them pretty damn good.<p>And when I heard this guy was from MSFT I thought &quot;well this is going to suck.&quot; Why? Because I thought that he may not care that I&#x27;m as scrappy as I am.<p>The position I was applying for wasn&#x27;t anything specific. It was just that utility player. I wasn&#x27;t expected to write gobs of code, I wasn&#x27;t expected to manage systems. I was just expected to do what was asked of me, and take ownership of it.<p>So the interview began. He asked me some really, really low-level questions. Questions that you&#x27;d be asked on an exam if you&#x27;re a CSCI major at MIT. I had no idea how to answer them, so I tried to explain them high-level and ignore the fact he wanted low-level answers.<p>That got me nowhere except him thinking down on me.<p>When it came down to me writing code, I just blanked. He wanted me to write a class for a shopping cart and he wanted to see how I&#x27;d apply a coupon code, how I&#x27;d manage the items in the cart, how I&#x27;d sort and group them together, etc. It lasted all of five minutes when I just disconnected from the internet, took the battery out of my phone, and sat there.<p>I suffer from crippling anxiety, and this was no exception. I&#x27;ve learned how to manage it better since, though.<p>About twenty minutes after my meltdown I emailed the CEO of the company. I was in tears, because I wanted the job so badly, and I explained that to him. I said that the guy was an asshole, really belittling, and didn&#x27;t reflect the values of those who I had spoke with prior.<p>I still got the job, and I&#x27;m still with them today. It&#x27;s the butt of a lot of the jokes we have with our team of five. &quot;Josh, is this someone you&#x27;d consider hanging up on?&quot; or &quot;Well it&#x27;s okay, because Josh once hung up on someone that was interviewing him.

I went back to university and studied math and philosophy. I mainly studied analytic philosophy which is basically western philosophy from ancient to scholastic to modern up until Hegel and then follows the Anglo/American tradition. Continental philosophy follows the same path up until Hegel and then takes a Franco/German tack.<p>I say all this because the writer fails to mention that the tradition he is having a go at is essentially continental philosophy. Contrary to forkandwait&#x27;s assertion in this comments page deconstruction is attributed to Derrida, not to Heidegger. Derrida was influenced by Heidegger (and says as much himself I believe) but Derrida is credited for this whole deconstruction lark. Literary critics working in the continental philosophical tradition will employ stuff like this. Others won&#x27;t, it is worth pointing this out.<p>Now then.<p>Analytic philosophers have a hard time decoding continental philosophers. So it is no surprise that people coming from even further afield have difficulty. I had a hard time initially, it took me a couple of years.<p>My take on deconstruction is that it is the technique of finding an internal contradiction in the text you want to refute and basically letting the text undermine itself. If it is anything more than this I&#x27;d like to know. I generally would never use the word deconstruct as it is too trendy and has become too intellectually charged for my liking. I prefer plain language. But I will use words like ontological when they need to be used but only then, if you see what I mean.<p>Finally, onto the claim of bogosity. I think maybe yes at times by certain windbags and lesser practitioners but mostly I think that no. In Derrida&#x27;s case I would say no. I say this is the back of having read &quot;Plato&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot; by Derrida and let me tell you it blows a lot of other philosophy out of the water. It is telling our man read a secondary source on Derrida, and did not drink straight from the fountain.<p>It irritates me immensely that someone believes they can read a couple of secondary texts and then claim to know enough to rubbish an entire swath of thinkers in the history of ideas. Continental philosophy gets most of the brunt of this because of the prolixity and verbosity of their texts. But I ask you, why has our chap not read Derrida for himself? Hmm? Because then he would have to read all of Derrida&#x27;s influences. And be aware of the currents of thought in which Derrida was swimming. And so on, back and back until you reach the ancient Greek thinkers. I mean analytic philosophers (less now than before) have reacted in very adverse ways to philosophical texts from continental philosophers so Chip has company. But you know, try harder I say.<p>One little final point. I think the reason the word &quot;problematic&quot; is used as a noun is because it is used as a noun in French. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I&#x27;m actually getting pretty tired of the condescending attitude from the science/engineering crowd. Some bits of philosophy are formal in the way that logic or maths is so it will never be empirical. And. So. What? Big deal that natural language is ambiguous but that&#x27;s part of its beauty as well.

He says:<p>&quot;Redemptive truth would not consist in theories about how things interact causally, but instead would fulfill the need that religion and philosophy have attempted to satisfy. This is the need to fit everything--every thing, person, event, idea and poem--into a single context, a context which will somehow reveal itself as natural, destined, and unique. It would be the only context that would matter for purposes of shaping our lives, because it would be the only one in which those lives appear as they truly are.&quot;<p>He appears to think this is possible; I think it&#x27;s a dangerous illusion. I don&#x27;t think there is any one, single context in which our lives &quot;appear as they truly are&quot;. Our lives are too complex for that.<p>In fact, physics is too, although Rorty doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that. He says that scientific inquiry could conceivably terminate; apparently he thinks that physicists who talk about a &quot;theory of everything&quot; mean that once we&#x27;ve found it, we won&#x27;t need to do science any more. That&#x27;s a dangerous illusion too. No matter how much we discover about the universe, there will always be more to discover, and that&#x27;s what scientific inquiry is.<p>Furthermore, even with the stuff we do know in science, there is always the possibility of finding new ways to look at it. Feynman once said that every theoretical physicist who is any good knows multiple theoretical representations for exactly the same physics. Each representation is useful in its own way, and no one of them reflects &quot;the way things really are&quot;. Even putting them all together doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect &quot;the way things really are&quot;. All of our knowledge is incomplete, even in physics.<p>And if that&#x27;s the case for physics, it&#x27;s the case even more so for ourselves and our societies. We should not expect to ever be able to understand ourselves using one single context, any more than we can understand physics using one single context. And as Rorty describes it, the search for this one single context by intellectuals (which he defines, reading between the lines, as people who can afford to waste time in such pursuits because they don&#x27;t have to do any productive work to make a living) is, in my opinion, a sad waste of human talents that could be put to better uses.",1379280559

Lots of businesses, individuals, and organizations want to know what is being said about them or their field.<p>Even though no company providing these services can have perfect coverage (not even a perfect coverage of public internet communications), or perfect accuracy (generally it boils down to what you can express with search facets and boolean expressions), they can very aggressively sell the capability to people and organizations, because the &#x27;idea&#x27; makes sense, and the fear/need is genuine - maybe there are relevant good/bad things happening out there that we need to know about.<p>I think this may be the real story here: there are private companies incentivized to sell surveillance of public communications, regardless of end-result quality for the customer, and education is just one of many places where that is relevant.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is going to change - we now take for granted that search engines can see what is on the public web, and the same will become true of public social media -- although these tools are (generally) not yet as well known to the public as Google web search.<p>I&#x27;d personally really like to see distributed and private social communications technology to take off, so that this kind of legitimized spying becomes near-irrelevant, and I think there are big opportunities there - but we&#x27;re not there yet and there&#x27;ll be some interesting ground to navigate in the meantime.<p>---<p>It&#x27;s interesting that this group is using the full Twitter firehose - and when you realize that this is just one of many other companies providing the same type of services (either in public or behind closed doors), it becomes clear that an entire industry now has incentives to encourage people to capture and publish more of their life - with additional geolocation/contextual information where possible as well.",1379280042

Most of the people claiming one way or the other seem to have something to sell.)<p>Even the example you give, graphics, is somewhat interesting to me.  It goes back to my thought where the &quot;metaphor&quot; of what you are doing is more math based already.

Couldn&#x27;t remember the actual drawbacks of the with syntax right off.  Similarly, I&#x27;ve seen a few times where you can use an import in scala to similar effect. Looks like:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x:Bar) {
        import x._

Seems if the compiler could track the state and provide indications to whether or not the desired state could be achieved, then the code could be clearer.<p>Consider the directions for driving cross country.  The required &quot;actor&quot; of the system is a vehicle with enough gas.

The idea is that you only work on your project during that day.  However in the current era just about any worthwhile programming effort will draw heavily upon years if not decades of previous work.  I would even guess that the most interesting efforts at hackathons are the ones most directly related to an individuals current area of expertise.<p>Many good programmers today are quite adept at modularization or other related efforts like framework building.  By utilizing existing frameworks and modules one can leverage an enormous amount of existing code.  I think though that many of the most worthy efforts at hackathons actually leverage existing modules or frameworks that were actually built or co ntributed to by the particular hackathon participant who is using them.<p>I think because of this contradiction and because it is difficult to distinguish between a completely new project and one that is a continuation of existing work that we need to alter the concept somewhat.<p>Getting together to hack on existing projects and describe them is probably a more honest and generally applicable idea.  If you really want to limit people to work done on that day you are going to need to be very specific about what types of existing modules and frameworks can be used and whether the  individuals participating may have created those. I&#x27;m not sure I really see a great point to that sort of exercise though unless it is just for developers to demonstrate how many interesting techniques and algorithms they can carry with them in their mind.

   If it&#x27;s a 1 through 8, wait that number of minutes. If it&#x27;s a 9, wait 15 
   minutes. If it&#x27;s a 10, wait an hour.
      How long is this string of tasks going to take? Summing the median time 
   expectancy, we get a sum 110 minutes, because the median time for a task is 
   5.5 minutes. The actual expected time to completion is 222 minutes, with 5+ 
   hours not being unreasonable if one rolls a lot of 9&#x27;s and 10&#x27;s.
      This is an obvious example where summing the median expected time for the 
   tasks is ridiculous, but it&#x27;s exactly what people do when they compute time 
   estimates, even though the reality on the field is that the time-cost 
   distribution has a lot more weight on the right. (That is, it&#x27;s more common 
   for a 6-month project to take 8 months than 4. In statistics-wonk terms, the 
   distribution is log-normal.)
      Software estimates are generally computed (implicitly) by summing the 
   good-case (25th to 50th percentile) times-to-completion, assuming perfect 
   parallelism with no communication overhead, and with a tendency for 
   unexpected tasks, undocumented responsibilities, and bugs to be overlooked 
   outright.

The point is, you are unable to know the worst possible outcome.  Since it will have huge input into your average, your average is therefore useless.  Perhaps the project isn&#x27;t specced fully enough and, during implementation, a dev discovers an ugly or impossible feature interaction.  You now have to either cut features or rearchitect another feature, ie the dice come up 10 in Michael&#x27;s analogy.<p>An example from my background: I work on ml code.  A learning algorithm was written in parallel with a particular loss function (essentially, this tells you if your estimates are good or bad).  The person writing the spec assumed that a different loss function could be dropped in later.  Indeed, this is how the math works on paper.  But loss function number 2 required a different data layout between the machines.  The vision was writing a new loss function should be one or two lines of code dropped into the middle of a hot loop; the reality was it took almost a month of work.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3522910"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3522910</a>",1379279207

For the first few days, it felt really odd to <i>not</i> work. I would wake up in the morning, have breakfast, fire up my laptop on the patio of my parents&#x27; house, and then... stare at the screen. After screwing around on HN and other sites, I would realize that it was 2pm and that I had &quot;wasted&quot; half my day. And I would <i>feel bad</i> about that.<p>After a few days though I realized how absolutely ridiculous that mindset was. I was on vacation and I was not supposed to be producing anything. I was supposed to be relaxing. It was like flipping a switch - I made a paradigm shift and spent the rest of my vacation &quot;doing nothing.&quot; It felt great!<p>If I ever find myself in the author&#x27;s situation where I have sufficient savings and am sitting on a beach in Thailand, instead of trying to continue working and getting stuff done, I&#x27;ll just check out mentally and enjoy life.",1379278874

Having recently taken that course (in the spring 2013 semester), I feel justified saying that this book needs a <i>lot</i> of work before it&#x27;s usable as a textbook or even a learning tool. Most of the time this text served primarily as an initial &quot;dereference&quot; of ideas yielding not concrete information, but a series of other pointers that I&#x27;d need to chase on Google before getting anything usable.<p>He clearly has high hopes for CIML, based on all the infoboxes and chapters that are still incomplete; it&#x27;s a shame he&#x27;ll likely need to get tenure before finishing it.<p>(This should in no way be taken as a slight on Hal&#x27;s teaching; his class was the best sort of challenging in that it required a large amount of work, and yielded a correspondingly large amount of insight. He&#x27;s also a fantastic lecturer and a fair grader.)",1379278821

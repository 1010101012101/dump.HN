88828,comment,88711,88785,0,0,dgreensp,,,"I think there's a very wide spectrum of people who can appreciate AppJet.  I would argue that most programmers don't have the knowledge to deploy a web app, especially if you define a ""programmer"" as someone who can hack together an AppJet app, which is very easy to do.  Even for a very capable programmer, it's a lot of work to get an app hosted if you haven't done it before.  Then there's programmers who CAN get a web app online, and have, but don't want to manage all the machines and software involved for every little project.<p>Before sites like Flickr, for example, it was possible to post photos online, just harder.  Maybe the difference in perception is that hackers aren't expected to want such an ""easy way out"" when it comes to programming, their very area of expertise.  But as a hacker myself I can tell you that using AppJet to whip up a quick app is a pleasure compared to going through all the typical production work.",1197489283

88826,comment,88816,88816,0,0,jsackmann,,,"It just occurred to me the other day why many sellers (especially eBayers who buy and sell in large volume) will stick with Paypal and not consider GCheckout before some major changes happen.<p>Until 2/1/08, Checkout is free, and Paypal is ~3%.  Clear win for Checkout, except...<p>You can buy lots and lots of stuff with a paypal account.  Not only that, but the money you get via paypal never leaves your paypal account.  With Checkout, Google automatically sends the money you receive to your checking account (in my case, anyway), which means that if you receive $1,000 and spend $1,000, all of that is going through an offline account.<p>In other words, if you're willing take a slight risk of a very invasive audit (i.e., one that looks at your paypal history), receiving  $1,000 thru paypal and spending $1,000 through paypal is all tax-free.  Doing the same through google means you take the tax hit on the income.<p>If I didn't hate paypal so much and like checkout so much, it'd be enough to get me to switch over right away.",1197488462

I don't get their aggregation proposal: there is nothing to aggregate - those two control most of the market, plus your friendly local dying Sunday newspaper.",1197488447

88821,comment,88711,88785,0,0,vegashacker,,,"You might very well be right that the overlap's small, but note that AppJet is potentially for programmers who <i>do</i> have  knowledge about deployment/hosting issues. How so?  Well, such a programmer might not want to deal with hosting issues for a particular project.  If the project s/he is attempting really is 100 LOC,  then getting the app all nice and hosted and scaleable might take an order of magnitude longer than the actual coding does.  AppJet, if it delivers nicely, could be a real win here.",1197488061

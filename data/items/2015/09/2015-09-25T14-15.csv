These are stereotypes that seem to be confirmed by the algorithm.<p>The core question - do you believe the problem will be fixed by better machine learning algorithms? Going back to the current example, do you believe that a Bayes-optimal machine learning algorithm for predicting criminal behavior will be &quot;unbiased&quot; (in the sense of social justice, not in the sense of statistics)?<p>Or, more concretely, do you believe that the only problem that mtgx and smtddr are complaining about is that our ML algorithms aren&#x27;t good enough and that maybe we need deep learning instead of random forests?",1443193135

10278526,comment,10273235,10275958,0,0,TodPunk,,,"You are describing turn-key solutions.  They are services that provide complete end-to-end consumption methods, like Netflix.  In the scenarios of content consumption (be it articles, movies/tv, or even games) even recent history has shown that it isn&#x27;t the availability of content that is the limiting factor, it is the accessibility of content.  What I mean by that is not that you have authorization to consume the content, but that you have the capability of enacting your end of the transaction (in this case, pressing play).<p>The reason VHS and DVD sales are better than digital is because it is still vastly easier to put a thing in a magic box hooked up to the TV and press play on the remote.  Even this is frought with danger (How do I hook it up, how do I get to the right input, where exactly is the button to play the movie on this DVD menu?)  This is also why you hear those complaints near constantly.<p>There&#x27;s other factors as well (like people not feeling like they own a file, but a DVD is theirs), but again the barrier to entry for consumers on computers is getting past having to think of any of the moving parts.  This is true in a lot of places, like automatic transmissions and ATMs (read up on the history of ATM interfaces, it&#x27;s fascinating if you&#x27;re into that).<p>Currently on a PC if you download a file that is a piece of media to consume, you have several important barriers for most people:
- I have to put the file somewhere, and I don&#x27;t understand filesystems
- I have to have software that uses the file format, that works on my machine
- I have to know how to use that software
- I have to know how to purchase the file, whatever that is supposed to mean
- I have to like how it&#x27;s being displayed
- I have to know how to get it from the machine I downloaded it on to my TV or whatever<p>There&#x27;s probably others in some scenarios, but you probably see the point.  A lot of things we tech users take for granted is that these things are very, very hard for most people, and they always have been (again, physical tech like cars or elevators follow this).  Even giving someone a link is barely beginning to scratch the surface of this process.  So this is, bar none, the reason digital is going to have problems until netflix or youtube or whatever can just play everything.<p>This is also, as a related aside, why a web browser and mobile apps win in breaking down those barriers.  Everyone already has them and it&#x27;s the &quot;click icon to do thing&quot; model, where icon might be a bookmark or typing a simple address, but the point is the same.  No installs, no understanding of local mechanics and difference.  It&#x27;s also why Apple products are viewed by the consumers as more user friendly.  There&#x27;s very little to understand about your machine on a Macbook.  You don&#x27;t have to take my word for it here.  Watch your average user use a mac.  Or read their user interface guides.",1443193103

The only exception I am making in my code are loop variables but the point doesn&#x27;t apply to those as you want the smallest scope possible so declaring them at the top of the block where the loop is located is just inferior.<p>I find the style easier to read as you can instantly see what variables will be operated on, what arrays filled etc. It&#x27;s also quite important for me to know how much stuff is allocated in given block so I don&#x27;t blow out the stack and having all the things at the top makes it easier to think about.
It&#x27;s probably about being used to it but I found the code with mixed declarations and logic to be inelegant and more difficult to understand.",1443192950

The gist was something like:<p>Poor people spend all the money they have. Once they&#x27;ve paid bills and bought food, etc., any money they have left over gets wasted on frivolous purchases like excess toys, magazines, and general cheap tat. This is easy to see: go to any council estate on any day of the week and you&#x27;ll see discarded plastic rubbish all over the place.<p>Normal people spend their money on liabilities like loans for cars, thus when they get some extra money they just spend it on getting more expensive things instead of getting wealthier.<p>The rich spend their money on assets, so any extra money compounds into extra wealth and increases at an increasing rate.<p>Poor people who would save the extra £10 here and there instead of spending it on frivolities would eventually not be poor any more.

Obviously, there&#x27;s plenty of terrible Java code out there, but there would be plenty of terrible Haskell code out there too if Haskell had similar levels of usage. In any case, I was responding to the general statement that Haskell&#x27;s purity makes reasoning easy by mere virtue of being pure. Well, LC is pure and it can be just as messy as Turing machines.

There exist many businesses in your town which, month in and month out, respond to RFPs for government services in the five figure or six figure range.<p>If there is any interest, I&#x27;ll share Appointment Reminder&#x27;s (unsuccessful) bid for a government contract in Hawaii.  That&#x27;s not ordinarily a huge portion of our business, but I became aware of the opportunity and it felt like a lay-up.  It wasn&#x27;t, as I failed to discover a key piece of information (namely, that an enterprise competitor had won the contract the year prior on a bid that was half of the minimum that I&#x27;d contemplate), but the process was not extraordinarily oppressive by the standards of An Adult Who Occasionally Plays Like This Is A Real Business.<p>Long story short: the white-hot competition to deliver 100k phone calls a year produced exactly two responsive bids, for $30k and $15k.  The competitor, who won, won with a one-pager that said &quot;Details substantially same as last year; if you don&#x27;t have our old brochure on file let me know and I&#x27;ll re-fax.  Signed, an employee whose only job is to file 250 bids for $15k a year and probably gets a gift certificate if more than 50 turn into sales.&quot;<p>My model for that bid, by the way, was &quot;$5k of AR services, $10k budget for extra Twilio calls, $10k for software customization, $5k for anticipated hassle.&quot;  That&#x27;s an internal model: Hawaii only cared about the final number.  (I can buy my competitor having economics which made their bid profitable at $15k, particularly if they amortize engineering costs over multiple years of anticipated renewals and/or they do enough similar business to amortize customizations over multiple accounts.)<p>The cost of the process for us:<p>Two hours of reading accessible online documentation of vendor qualification requirements for Hawaii, written at a 5th grade reading level.<p>One hour to understand the bid requirements.<p>Four hours writing a proposal which, like all proposals responsive to government RFPs, is basically &quot;The system will be capable of Copy Paste Language From RFP Here.  One sentence of elaboration.&quot;<p>Two hours of pushing faxes around to supplement the data collected by Hawaii&#x27;s (fairly painless!) online vendor qualification process.<p>One hour responding to a general excise tax audit occasioned by a filing of Hawaii state business registration mandated by the process.  (Result: we do not owe it, as anticipated.)<p>$60 in out-of-pocket costs for various regulatory fees.<p>Plenty of companies do this stuff week in and week out, for everything from &quot;dig up a military statue and transport and replant it to a new location without causing structural damage; $40k&quot; to &quot;400 orange jumpsuits; must not contain any structural element capable of causing suffocation; remove all elastic; shipping included; $8k.&quot;  It&#x27;s like any other sales process: you win some, you lose some, you build processes such that your win rate costs you a percentage low enough to allow you to still make money on the business.",1443191204

This of course was and is still used in dictatorships of all kinds of sizes and employed by numerous secret police agencies around the world.

Some of this is due to structural concerns (fund-based accounting imposes limitations on how you procure and encumber expenditures) and some due to substantive concerns (agencies do not have the space to &quot;pivot&quot; their operations; when you&#x27;re responsible for public safety and welfare, incremental iteration can be a pretty risky play); in either case, it certainly, as you point out, biases governmental organizations to caution, trading money and time for predictability.<p>Unfortunately, as we know, in project management unameliorated risk is a compounding factor, and iteration and hypothesis testing are some of the few risk sinks we know about in practice.

You (the startup) have to figure it out yourself.<p>Selling to the government is very similar to selling to any other industry/company: you (the seller or maker) have to understand the customer&#x27;s acquisition process.  The big difference is that the federal government is the largest customer--millions of people and trillions of dollars.  Therefore, they have a lot of rules and they all attempt to ensure &quot;fairness&quot; when the government tries to acquire something.<p>How do you do begin to understand that behemoth? Here are some tips:<p>-You invest some (a lot) of time understanding the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) <a href=""https://www.acquisition.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acquisition.gov</a>.  There are training classes available online and in person.<p>-Speak with acquisition specialists or contracting officers to understand the regulations specific to your product/industry.<p>-Learn about the specific rules/advantages that may apply to your company.  There are many many preferences for small business, veteran-owned companies, disabled-owned companies, women-owned companies, etc.<p>-Understand what &quot;fair&quot; means to the federal government in the context of acquisition.  It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;the best solution&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t always mean &quot;the cheapest solution&quot;.<p>-Learn how to navigate the government&#x27;s Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Information (RFI) processes so that you can be a part of delivering answers/solutions to the problems that the government has determined they have.  The big government contractors have this stuff figured out.  They know how to read an RFP and respond, even if they don&#x27;t have the solution themselves.<p>-Understand the concept of &quot;prime contractor&quot; and &quot;sub contractors&quot;.  Prime contractors often win large government contracts but decide to/have to &quot;sub&quot; some of the work out.  There are often regulations on how and what types of companies they must sub work out to.  For example, AT&T may win a large networking contract but sub the work out to 10-15 other smaller companies to execute.",1443190210

I&#x27;m not one of them, though. Particularly in situations where law enforcement has obtained a lawful warrant, I think they should have a way to get that information. People do commit crimes, and the police do need to solve them.<p>One way to grant the police access is to somehow give them privileged access to the encryption. For me, this idea is dead on arrival. There is no way to grant privileged access to the police without dangerously weakening the encryption in general. I&#x27;m a believer that encryption, properly implemented without backdoors, creates a lot more good than bad.<p>So what does that leave? It leaves compelling the owner of the phone to unlock it. If the police get a warrant to search your house, you are legally required to unlock the door and let them in. It seems to me that a passcode on the phone serves exactly the same purpose.<p>So, my concern is that if compelling the phone owner to unlock is not an option, it will put a lot more pressure behind the idea of encryption backdoors, as the &quot;only option&quot; to give law enforcement the power they need to do their jobs.",1443190177

But the specific issue they address is Google&#x27;s suite of Android apps.<p>I know for me as an end user, it&#x27;s very inconvenient when I don&#x27;t want to use Google&#x27;s Android, but still want access to the Google Play Store. If you use Cyanogenmod or other custom apps, you have to download google apps. If you use Amazon&#x27;s Fire devices, the process is a little more inconvenient. On the one hand you have to wonder whether this harms adoption of third-party Android devices, running Cyanogenmod, FireOS, OxygenOS, or any of a number of other custom Android forks. However, Amazon has become somewhat successful in introducing an alternate app marketplace, and this leads to the other question.<p>Is Google&#x27;s inclusion of Google apps only on Google android harmful to other app developers? I know personally, if I had a choice between the Google Play Store and the Amazon Appstore, I would choose Google Play 100%. It just has more of the apps I want. But if you want to give users an option, how would you do it? I suppose a scenario similar to what the EU imposed on Microsoft would work, where on activation you would pick from a list of appstores to download to your device. This would at least give users options. I also know personally that I would just stick with the default Maps and Chrome apps if they were bundled with the device instead of giving me a choice of downloading alternate maps and browser apps. This makes it hard for developers of those apps to compete.<p>Ultimately, this just goes to show that you should take the claim that Android is &quot;open&quot; with a grain of salt. Not only is Google restricting access to Android, there&#x27;s also this troubling bit from the article:<p>>“When we say we’re concerned, it’s not only because [the FTC] didn’t do a good investigation the first time around, or the fact that they didn’t protect the confidentiality of the people who complained,&quot; Reback said, “but also because they seem to take directions from Google.”",1443189900

False passwords have a much older history than that.<p>Investigators are going to take a very dim view of such events, and probably didn&#x27;t get to the point of demanding access without having documented sensible reason to believe the evidence is there - and may very well have actionable proof that you destroyed evidence, which will not turn out in your favor.",1443189805

Predictive _analytics_ is a machine that pulls non-random patterns out of data and presents this as _information_.<p>To say that other tools have a bad track record may count as a valid argument, but to me, it is a weak and fatalistic one. Judge each tool on its own merit or discard all tools as useless seems like an easy choice.<p>Predicting crime works in practice and theory. These models are not black boxes, they can be introspected. Bias can be detected and removed.<p>COINTELPRO was a program to infiltrate and disturb organizations that the state viewed as unwelcome. Monitoring social media activity is common detective work. The modern equivalent of an officer peeking over the fence in your back garden to see a stolen motorbike. Now they can use Google Maps for that.

They may note your biometrics (eye color, iris pattern, hair samples, fingerprints, etc), doing so non-invasively (no blood samples unless you&#x27;re already bleeding); as such they could take your hand and press your finger onto a fingerprint reader, just as they are allowed to gather prints for a background check without a warrant (AFAIK).

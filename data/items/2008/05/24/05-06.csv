Second Life is still in its infancy, and it's useful only in specific situations.\nI consider evangelists very important for an organization such as Amazon.\nThey don't have an explicit position on Second Life, though.\nBest,",1211608346

198637,comment,198601,198601,0,0,rw,,,"Read Norvig's introductory text, but don't feel you have to know it all - use it as a way to pick something you really are interested in (genetic algorithms are always popular) and read academic literature on the topic (citeseer is a good resource here). Use Wikipedia, Scholarpedia. Get an intuitive sense of dynamical systems, problem spaces and landscapes, and chaos theory. Get a grip on combinatorial explosion, and just how much it can suck for optimization problems. Learn theory of computation, and glance (more than once) at symbolic logic.<p>That will set you on your way! Good luck, it is fascinating stuff.",1211607254

Perhaps it's unfair discrimination and perhaps I am just ignorant to SL's real worth/usefulness, but... I can live with that.<p>I disagree with you on your edit, however; ""evangelists"" can be very important to an organization.",1211606381

Now go convince those who make money out of privileged information that this is a <i>really</i> good idea.<p>Reminds me of the cases of life insurances and real state business as explained in Freakonomics: ""experts"" are usually just people with privileged information. For them to give it up, something aweful (from their perspective) must happen, like the internet. Perhaps there is hope.",1211605744

Please dont get me wrong I believe you should follow your passion and if that takes dropping out of school or climbing Mt. Everest follow Nike and just do it!  Maybe dropping out of school shows the investor that you are serious but are you dropping out because you are serious or because youre bored and this offers you a way out?  Am I way off on this line of thought?  By the way if I was facing the same decision I would drop out too.",1173194581

This has certain advantages, and where those advantages apply, of course you're going to be successful. If you don't mind having less than 100 percent control over your email, and don't mind google's data mining it for [any|all] reasons, then go ahead and use gmail. Large corporations aren't going to do this, if only for legal reasons.\n",1173194140

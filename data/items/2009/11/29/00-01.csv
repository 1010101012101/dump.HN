965733,comment,965690,965690,0,0,rbanffy,,,"I have many problems with this point-of-view.<p>Before any fiduciary obligation, a manager (just like any other human being) has moral obligations towards society. The fiduciary obligation is to create value to your shareholders, but not just the present ones that will dump your stock the same week they bought it. For those long-term investors, I believe the ""I will strive to create sustainable economic, social, and environmental prosperity worldwide"" idea creates a lot of value in the long term.<p>As for the oath promoting unethical behaviour, the first promise takes care of that. The ethanol companies... well... They are thriving in Brazil. There must be something in trying to make it from corn that is fatal to companies.<p>The oath being a misplaced response... I am not sure about that either. It's obviously a response to some less-than-ethical behaviour that had disastrous consequences to shareholder value. But that same unethical behaviour paid handsomely for those who were able to jump ship fast. I wouldn't call benefiting that group a smart business move and many companies that aimed that way no longer exist.<p>As for people not being driven by pledges, again, I am a professional engineer and I took an oath when I graduated. I have so far been true to it and I take it very seriously every day of my professional life.<p>If he doesn't like the idea of striving ""to create sustainable economic, social, and environmental prosperity worldwide"", that's fine by me, but I think everyone of us would benefit from such a mindset.",1259456052

965725,comment,965686,965686,0,0,tptacek,,,"I think this is a fairly boring survey.<p>The bulk of this paper makes the argument that DRM and anticircumvention retard open source development. Of course it does. But while we can all agree that open source is a powerful force for good in general, it's less obvious to me that open source <i>entertainment software</i> is a necessity.<p>Why are producers of content obliged to support any particular format or venue? While I have to concede that it would be a better world if Linux could natively play BD+-protected Blu-Ray, I do not need to concede that the world would be a better place if that happened because regulations compelled private businesses to make business decisions based on papers by Wendy Seltzer. I'm worried about what other rules would come along for the ride there.<p>I found the technical content here superficial. The article quotes Schneier, and then compares the ""hard but solved"" problem of exchange information between two people to the (implied) unsolved problem of securely distributing content. This perpetuates a misunderstanding about the goal of DRM.<p>DRM schemes don't succeed or fail based on whether they absolutely protect any given piece of content. They succeed to the extent that they recover profit leaked to freeriders. If it takes Slysoft 72 extra hours to rip the most recent BD+ release because of a DRM renewal, it is very possible that the content producer will recover the expense of the entire DRM scheme in that one release window alone.<p>Furthermore, while it is presumed impossible to prevent bits from being copied, it is less clear that it's Hard to trace them. The CS technology underlying tracing, watermarking, revocation, and renewability isn't very new, but the industry adoption of it --- particularly among slow-witted consumer electronics conglomerates --- is in its infancy. It's still too early to tell whether ""modern"" DRM is going to succeed.",1259455233
965724,comment,964665,965152,0,0,etal,,,"Physics and math software is usually fine, sure, since the performance and reliability of the code matters in the experiments. I mean traditional biology and the less computer-oriented sciences, where they tend to just use scripts to filter data into a usable form, crunch some numbers, and generate visualizations. There, unless the software is the point of the research, writing code doesn't get the same priority (or respect) as traditional experiments. A lot of those professors just don't care about writing maintainable code; I'm guessing Dr. Briffa is one of those.",1259455124

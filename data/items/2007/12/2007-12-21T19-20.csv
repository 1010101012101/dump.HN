91785,comment,91738,91738,0,0,uuilly,,,"I am an entrepreneur and I am dyslexic and I have ADHD.  It's way worse with numbers than words though.  Basically I just have to be really careful copying numbers by hand.  It made proofs in E school a nightmare.  For a few days I even had numbers reversed on my own phone number for my answering machine message!<p>I agree with this article completely.  As a matter of fact I have never read an article from new.yc that hits home more than this one.  <p>""If you have a healthy dose of rejection in your life, you are going to have to figure out how to do it your way.""<p>I like this a lot.  Living in the bowels of the the academic system taught me to think fast.  I was constantly one step away from total academic destruction and I had to think on my feet to beat the system.  Often that meant talking parents out of punishments and teachers out of giving me bad grades.  Great training for startups.  Everything is always on fire and your company depends on convincing clients, investors, employees and customers to keep cool in the midst of a blaze.  Only now we get to do what we're good at and hire people to do what we're bad at.  <p>I also like the parts about verbal communication, delegation and trust.  All apply to me in spades.  My co-founder is hyper-organized and hyper-systematic.  He's the tortoise and I'm the hare.  He is very good at keeping us on track and not forgetting details and I'm really good at game time decisions during sales and VC meetings. <p>I also think hacking is great for the dyslexic.  You can write code that masks your weaknesses.  Also ADHD people fear repetition above all else.  Some say we descend from hunters who thrive in dynamic environments, while most ""normal people"" descend from farmers and thrive in more predictable environments.  It means that hacking is our natural ally in the fight against repetition.  <p>Whatever the case, I don't think kids should be put on drugs to solve these so called problems.  They need HEAVY exercise and an some recognition that they have something offer even if it doesn't happen in school.  Though perhaps with that recognition they might no longer be outside the system and they may not develop the strengths that this article suggest.  That is something I've thought about a lot...<p>Sorry for the ramble, like I said, that hit home.",1198266707

91779,comment,91667,91667,0,0,webwright,,,"I recall (from my overpriced and underutilized psychology degree) that there is some pretty good tests to determnine how people learn...  Some people absorb better when listening, some by reading, some people are haptic (hands-on), etc.  I think that the challenge is understanding each user enough to be able to personalize the presentation/learning style.<p>Telling me I need to take 10 minutes of tests for a site to be able to provide value isn't going to be an easy sell.",1198265250
91778,story,,,5,5,JSnow,"Question: Quality Books/Tutorials for PHP",,"Hello everyone;<p>I just got a job. Actually, I just got my first job, that I'm actually interested in, (I'm 19 years old) assisting in the development of a [deep breath] massively-multiplayer browser-based textual game created in PHP. Fortunately my employer does not mind that I'm just learning such things as programming and is willing to fund my endeavors. Let's face it -- I'm taking university-level courses through Athabasca University -- leading to a Bachelor of Science in Computing and Information Systems-- and I have a lot of extra time on my hands (first project is a [shivers] an Access database utilizing four relational tables for a imaginary, and simplified, video rental store). So I have the time to learn and procrastinate. 
 
Now I have dabbled in PHP before as well as things like: LISP (Scheme), C (++), FreePascal, and Python; However, dabbling as fun as it is, does not provide me with the full skill-set that I likely require. What I need is a list of ""must read"" PHP and web site design tutorials (and books if possible). I have read quite a bit on the PHP home page as well as some stuff taken off of search engine results but I may have (and likely) missed something important.
 
So, any suggestions?",1198265219

I want the API to be as painless as possible to call from, and implement in, languages including at least PHP, REST, Python, Ruby, and Java.<p>I could use SOAP or REST for the model interface, but it seems like a lot of overhead for local calls.

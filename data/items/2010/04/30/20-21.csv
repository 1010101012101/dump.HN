1309393,comment,1308444,1309077,0,0,bitwize,,,"No, fuck you. The rules aren't just ""the rules"". They are directly derivable from the property of distributivity of multiplication over addition. E.g., 12 * 39 = 12 * (30 + 9) by the property of place value, and hence 12 * 39 = (12 * 30) + (12 * 9) by distributivity. Then you do the same thing again with the 12s to get the two subresults, and... well, you get the idea. This is the basis of the standard algorithm, and it is derived directly from the properties of multiplication itself.<p>But this line thing... this is a trick. And, might I add, a trick that may actually cause more work and use up more scratch-paper space for the figurer. Using a ""visual framework"" without <i>meaning</i> is no way to teach math. The point is that the standard algorithm is <i>the shortest</i> path from point A to point B, and that is why it should be taught first and foremost.",1272661117

Our msgpush.com server logs into your e-mail account to watch for incoming e-mail messages. We do NOT read your messages, we just watch for new ones to arrive.<p>2. Your iPhone or iPod Touch keeps a connection open to our msgpush.com server. It uses the ""Microsoft Exchange"" connection type, because that's how we can send you notifications.<p>3. When a new message arrives in your e-mail account, the msgpush.com server notices and sends your device a true push notification. Your device buzzes (or dings) and the Mail badge on your home screen updates to show the new message.<p>4. To read the message, just open the Mail app. Mail downloads the new message from your own mail server.<p>5. Once your email has been accessed, the msgpush notifications get removed to ensure that your Mail badge count is accurate as possible. There is never any need to open, read or touch the msgpush account on your phone again.<p>We have had excellent feedback from our users and we think its a nice add-on for anyone who has not yet found a push option that works for them.<p>We are offering free 2-week trial subscriptions for anyone who wants to give it a try. After the initial trial, it works out to $1 a month.<p>Cheers,<p>Michael Reid\nhttp://msgpush.com",1272659573

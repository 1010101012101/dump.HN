8062836,comment,8061013,8061481,1,0,flipped_bit,,,"I fully agree with you and I have my theories:<p>1) The early 2000 dot-com crash + the Enron crash that changed the regulatory landscape to make it harder for companies to IPO.  This has resulted in start-ups being formed for the pure purpose of the acquisition route - fund, and flip strategy.<p>2) I see the Netscape IPO as the transition point - I like to call the eras, BN and AN (before-Netscape, and after-Netscape) which coincided with the commericialization of the internet. Netscape IPO with its cult of the young founder started this trend.<p>All you have to do is list the companies that were formed in the BN vs the AN era, and get a feel of the &#x27;engineering quotient&#x27; of these companies. Of course it also coincides with software overshadowing hardware companies where the former requires less upfront capital than the latter.<p>The capital requirements have gone down even further thanks to virtulization and consolidated infrastructure services like AWS.<p>3) Paradoxically larger involvement of the state. All the UC system and other universities occurred due to the threat of the cold war. Almost all the success of technology companies since the 1980s&#x27; can be traced back to the investments made in the earlier decades in universities (eps. in STEM fields), infrastructure (inter-state highways) and so forth.<p>How the same forumula can be replicated is going to be a challenge. Some signs like allowing private companies like Space-X to compete and augment govt. agencies might be the first steps - it will create new markets that will drive innovation.<p>The American triangular replationship between the State, Universities, and Private Enterprise are the 3 legs of the proverbial stool, and when one or the other legs weakens, the whole edifice starts to stumble.<p>4) Larger numbers of H1Bs who are legalized indentured labor that makes it harder for them to be confrontational with their employers.  Note I myself went thru. the process, so I am not your garden-variety bigot here. My answer to this is to streamline the immigration process to:\n a) Delink H1Bs&#x27; from a spnosoring employer. Allow H1Bs&#x27; to freely move to any companies to allow a more fluid labor market.<p>b) Allow H1Bs&#x27; to start companies - i.e. if they get VC funded (as founders, co-founders or early founding member teams), they get immediate upgrade to green cards. DHS can keep a list of certified VCs&#x27; where this program can apply, and it can also get a % of equity as a one-time fee (along with other concrete fees), so the immigration department can be self-sustaining, and overall encourge more entrepreneurship.<p>c) Reduce the 6 year process to 3 years for H1Bs to acquire green-cards, and remove country-based quotas (a holdover from 1920s regulations to limit immigrants were certain undesired countries which is really an anachronism in todays globalized economy).<p>Note from an IRS pespective, you are as good as a American citizen or a green-card holder after the 6 months residing in the US - i.e. you are submitting full taxes as anyone else, and IRS treats you as a resident.",1405927512

Only individual people can do that.&quot;<p>That is true to an large degree, but I think it over-simplifies things sligtly. Giant collectives like governments and corporations, and small collectives like startups, can still have a &quot;culture&quot; (for want of a better word). They have an institutional way of doing things, and they tend to hire people who fit that culture, who think in the same way, and hold the same values, as the people who are already there.<p>In government, until sometime around the &#x27;80s, there was a strong culture of loyalty that went back a long, long time. Possibly to near the start of the 20th century, maybe further. In corporations, it was there too. It might have started dissolving in the &#x27;70s, and may not have gone further back than the &#x27;40s (although, e.g. IBM&#x27;s may also go back to the &#x27;20s or &#x27;30s) but it was there for decades.<p>Further, these organisational cultures were small-c conservative, eschewing change without good reason, and promoting people who thought likewise. Who would, in turn, do the same.<p>And so you really could have a reasonable idea of the <i>type of person</i> who would be running the show 40 years from now. In fact, given a culture of loyalty and conservatism, you might even be able to tell who will be holding the power 40 years from now. It&#x27;s 25-year-old Dave in the next office, who seems just that little bit more organised, that little bit more dependable, that little bit more of a &quot;fit&quot; than you and the people around you.<p>Whether people were better off or not back then isn&#x27;t something I want to get into, but even though the culture of loyalty is long gone now, it was a real tangible thing for decades, which is why it still echoes today.<p>For instance, the lessons we learn from our parents stick with us. If they told us that jobs are for life, there will be some part of us that wants to believe that our current job is more secure than it might actually be.<p>And so, for many people (well, many people over 30) it&#x27;s an idea we have to consciously remind ourselves to ignore.",1405926842

At Google, it&#x27;s not uncommon to hear &quot;Can&#x27;t we just buy [famous startup X]?&quot; or &quot;Figure out the benefit for users, and if it turns out to be useful for a large number of people, we&#x27;ll see if the lawyers and lobbyists can get the law changed&quot; or &quot;We&#x27;ll just throw 65,000 machines at the problem.&quot;  As a result, there&#x27;s a presumption that problems are <i>solvable</i> if we just think really hard and identify the incentives of everybody in the system.  Few startups have this privilege.<p>Where Google really falls down compared to a startup is in <i>micro</i>-level thinking.  A PM at Google may understand how a hundred million users behave in the aggregate, but fail to understand how to change <i>one</i> user&#x27;s behavior.  When your sole work experience is at a powerful corporation, you start assuming that people will take your phone calls, and you don&#x27;t develop the skills of how to cold-call an ambivalent prospect, or how to empathize with a minority user who is really frustrated, or how to focus and prioritize on only the tasks that you can make a real impact on.<p>For engineers, I&#x27;d say Google (and presumably Microsoft) engineers understand far better than a startup why simplicity is important.  The codebase, after all, is orders of magnitude bigger and harder to understand.  And iterations and tests are common practice as well.

New, out-larged goals, visible checklists for what should be done, regular follow-ups.<p>But after a few months I realised his vulnerability in still feeling vulnerable.  We didn&#x27;t chat explicitly, and in retrospect we should have, but on a particularly difficult challenge that all thought impossible, we were achieved a big result, and bonded on that.<p>This was a management role where it easy to hire &#x27;workers&#x27; but painfully hard to find people with requisite domain knowledge and demonstrable management experience, in a location it was very hard to get people to relocate (internally) to.  If the salary offers you&#x27;re seeing are higher, it is likely you are in an equally illiquid market.  I also never explicitly asked for a raise, but after some time and trust had developed he bumped me up quite a bit.<p>It may be the case that the new incumbent in the role feels they do not have control.

They were asking for permission to do all kinds of things to my stream, which as I understood it later to be the only option at the time.  I tweeted about it, they replied and said ""sorry about that"" then a few months went by.  Out of the blue I get a tweet - hey we no longer require Twitter authentication!  I couldn't believe it - really great case of tracking down sources of early negative feedback long after I'd forgotten about the issue and reminding me that they were still there, and still improving.  Fantastic.",1346677046

I wasn't meaning to imply skepticism, just that I don't recall having actually seen a go/no-go number explicitly spelled out elsewhere, that 12% p.a. is the rough threshold delineating whether VC is worth it as an asset class, taking into account the risk/liquidity/etc.<p>I suppose going forward it mainly depends on what you think will happen to the stock market. Will the next 20 years see the resumption of the WW2-through-1990s performance level, or will they look more like the past 20 years, with middling to flat returns? If the latter, VC might become attractive at even lower returns compared to anemic returns in ""regular"" equity, but if the former, then it may become less attractive compared to a more liquid and diversified stock portfolio.",1346676976

Having had used GWT and other similar cross compiling to javascript type tools, it's often a huge problem in debugging than if you just write a short javascript code. No offense to the author but projects like these that try to fit a static language like Java/C# that run in their own managed environments into dynamic world of Javascript fail miserably.<p>I fear projects like these tend to attract programmers who know C#, Java but don't quite want to learn javascript and they don't even try to do it once they run out of runway in this tool. And, the code becomes undebuggable, bloated on the browser.<p>Nothing against other languages, they're amazing at what they do. But, javascript is, for better or worse, the language of browsers. And it's really powerful with established best practices to organize, debug code + great tools (thanks to Chrome Team @ Google and Mozilla).<p>From a programming languages/compilers standpoint, it definitely tickles my fancy :)",1346676716

On the other hand I feel that sometimes people address personal finance as a simple arithmetic exercise (income - expense), whereas I think it is sometimes better treated in a more algebraic fashion.<p>In other words identify the variables in your balance sheet (Hint: everything is a variable) and try to anticipate what happens as things change. Your finances are affected by changes outside of your control, for example the government or local authority can decide to stick your taxes up, changes in the commodities market can affect the price of staples such as a food and fuel or your electric company might read your meter and then slap you with a bill of double your usual amount.<p>This is something that I find annoying about the UK, whilst all of the high street banks offer some form of online banking none of them to my knowledge will allow me to pull out the raw data and play with it. I'm sure that using some fairly rudimentary statistical analysis I could gain much more insight into the implications of my financial situation.<p>For example, let's say I get a pay rise. I might be inclined to celebrate by going out and buying a brand new iPad or whatever. But maybe if I sum the amount that I spend at the supermarket each month I notice an upward trend that will wipe out the pay increase within 6 months. Does this mean that I am acquiring ""good taste"" in a few too many areas or does it simply mean that ""cost of living"" is increasing faster than inflation and I need to account for that.",1346676474

The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than it actually is, while the highly skilled underrate their abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority. This leads to the perverse situation in which less competent people rate their own ability higher than more competent people. It also explains why actual competence may weaken self-confidence: because competent individuals falsely assume that others have an equivalent understanding. ""Thus, the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.""<p>“In the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.”<p>— Bertrand Russell",1277128715

Tell your lawyer friend to use the person's last name and/or DOB (or some equivalently easy to remember token) as the password. Pre-arrange the password over the phone--since it is based on their name it is easy to tell them what it is. The key here is to stop the vast majority of folks who might stumble across the email. Again, given a sufficiently motivated intruder, this is pointless, but still more secure than plain old email.<p>3. Use encrypted archives of the documents. The files can be encrypted with AES256 or an equivalently difficult cypher. Test the type of archive/encryption to ensure that Windows XP and above will be able to decrypt the file easily w/ the build in archive folders. This can avoid any potential compatibility problems with #2 from above. It might introduce new ones.<p>Using a web drop service doesn't eliminate the need to protect the file. If you password protect the file then you need to share the password. If you password protect access to the file, you need to share the password. The link in an email is nearly equivalent to an attachment, so it doesn't really solve anything unless you have an easy way to share a secret with the receiver.",1277128495

Ah, but there you have it. Given the right incentive, it suddenly isn't so hard to do or remember things that 'should' be done. These people complain that they are 'just incapable' of remembering certain things, but if they were <i>really</i> 'just incapable' of that, then they wouldn't be able to do it in the face of imminent eviction, arrest or death either.<p>This shows that in fact, the ""I'm just not capable"" line is just a smokescreen: an easy-to-give, hard-to-criticize excuse that saves them from having to do soul searching and give the true reason: they have <i>chosen</i> not to care and they have <i>chosen</i> not to go through the trouble of trying to remember/do this stuff. Having to defend a choice that goes contrary to societies expectations is much harder than defending a claimed 'incapability'.<p>So far, so good. There isn't really anything bad about that choice, though I wish people would just own up to it. What's a problem, is that people that don't admit, even to themselves, that they made this choice, tend to become lazy. Letting bills accumulate, feeding yourself badly, dressing in such a way that friends don't want to hang out with you because you smell: these are things that make your life worse. Actually going through the trouble to prevent it from happening would make them happier. People tend to conflate the choice for an alternative lifestyle with laziness, precisely because they tend to go hand-in-hand.<p>I bet these people have a hard time keeping relationships going. I've never met a girl that didn't feel strongly about something that I couldn't care less about. An example: I never drained the sink after washing up. It was just something that always slipped my mind. However, my girlfriend hates having to stick her hand into that filthy, cold water the next morning to pull the plug and she complained about that a few times. I also hate that when I have to do it, but it kept slipping my mind. At some point, I simply <i>chose</i> to remember it and ever since then: no problem. And you know what, it saves me the annoyance of cold, filthy water as well. I changed behavior that I had for years and that I always said 'I was just incapable of remembering'.",1277127273

RAID is not a backup because you can get data corruption and you just replicate the corruption.<p>Imagine that they got part of their A server having issues, which are with current FS+RAID simply ignored. You can run months without integrity check even with Git because if you add new objects and do not need to repack, no integrity check is performed on the old objects. So your corruption spread from A to B (RAID) to backup (daily snapshot). Then you need at home to checkout because you lost your HD, you are doomed. Full data loss without a single warning. If you are a single developer on your own private project, this scenario is easy to achieve.<p>I really really like the way Fastmail is doing backup. They are replaying the IMAP operations with checksum. With Git you can also replay with checksum too. In fact, it is built in thanks to the DSCM nature of Git.<p>For the backup of my customer git repositories, this is what I am doing, in the post-update hook, I fire a git sync with git on another server, it is doing everything needed while being CPU+bandwidth efficient. Thank you git.<p>The easy way to do it: <a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2007/10/18/346839"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2007/10/18/346839</a>",1277125470

I now realise this is because one in four permanent residents of Australia were born overseas (2006 census). In comparison, Japan has very little migration. This makes it seem like a special kind of bubble, able to sustain many interesting and valuable cultural aspects at the cost of some social stagnation. Then again, maybe I'm just biased towards the kind of place I grew up in.",1277125359

1448651,comment,1448309,1448608,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I don't know if this is the place for that discussion, but briefly, I think posting to SO gives them an implicit right to show your content on the web and store it on their servers. What I <i>don't</i> think it gives them an implicit right to do is re-license your content under cc-wiki, provide it in a data dump, and specify how you are to be attributed for your contribution. When I've brought this up with SO, their response was that because the footer says that all content is licensed under cc-wiki, it's OK. I disagree. If I say that your response to this comment will be in the public domain, that doesn't make it so. I would need your <i>explicit</i> permission to re-license your comment, even though I have certain implicit permissions, like the permission to cache it in my browser.<p>For comparison, Wikipedia requires that all submitters ""irrevocably agree to release [their] contributions under the  CC-BY-SA 3.0 License and the GFDL. [They] agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution under the Creative Commons license."" (See the comment under the edit box on any Wikipedia edit page.) Wikipedia is big enough to actually deal with legal issues, and this is how they do it. They get explicit permission, and they explicitly require agreement with a particular method of attribution.<p>I am not a lawyer, but everything I've read about copyright (from reliable sources, such as the actual legal code) suggests that Wikipedia is doing it right. There are certain implicit permissions with user-submitted content. Permission to re-license is not one of them. Since Wikipedia <i>does</i> re-license content, they ask for permission to do so. SO should do the same.<p>OK, that wasn't as brief as I hoped. I apologize. I don't mean to derail the commentary here.",1277125255

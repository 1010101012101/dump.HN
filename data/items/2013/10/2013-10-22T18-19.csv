6593962,comment,6593780,6593780,3,0,vsampath,,,"Apple is going for even higher margins, and it will still sell well since who doesn&#x27;t want a lighter iPad?<p>* SoC: A5X was 165mm^2. A6X was 123mm^2. A7 is only 102mm^2 with a 64-bit memory interface instead of 128-bit. They can do PoP memory too for even smaller PCB area. So much cheaper.
* WiFi/LTE: same chips probably used on iPhone 5c, 5s, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Simpler inventory and buy in even higher quantities.
* Screen: same screen as all previous retina generations likely.
* Battery: much smaller since the GPU is more efficient. More cost savings.",1382466526

While we&#x27;re obviously not there yet for everyone, I think Firebase really gives us a taste of that future.

You mention the complexity of updating a row in MVCC; sure, but all the database has to do before reporting success to the user is to write its intent to make this change to the transaction log (WAL in PostgreSQL, redo log in Oracle). The actual changes to the data files can be written back later on. The transaction log is a single stream being continuously written to disk, so that should be very fast.<p>MongoDB, on the other hand, is making scattered writes across its mmapped data files, which should be much slower. Except that of course it&#x27;s probably doing this on a journalled filesystem, which is using exactly the same mechanism as the RDBMSs to provide fast, safe updates.<p>I&#x27;d be really interested to see how a simple update to a single field translates into actual writes to disk for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

I've never found a resource that explained CSS well.<p>CSS still surprises me almost daily. I'll be probably fluent in Haskell before I ever get CSS. What would really help me is having the source code of a well-written, high-level CSS rules engine - written for educational purposes, not for performance.",1204635036

It's the hope that not implementing opt-out version targeting is a precedent that IE8 will continue to follow.<p>The IE team recently has shown great dedication to bringing new versions of IE up to par with the standards set out by the W3C. I would not be surprised if they are close to on par with adoption alongside the other browsers, and with no opt-out version targeting we'll be able to more immediately see these changes take place.",1204634349
128789,comment,128447,128767,0,0,mdemare,,,"Germany also has high unemployment because of the reunification, so it would be much harder to go down to 5%.<p>Anyway, of course 5% unemployment is better than 12%. On the other hand, Germans have less to fear from unemployment. Not only are they much harder to fire, but the unemployed are better off in Germany, and don't have to worry about losing health insurance. So Germans have more peace of mind than Americans. This comes with a hefty price tag, of course. So it's a trade-off.<p>My point was: Germany is doing just fine, in its own way, and there is even a start-up scene in Berlin.",1204634337

In fact, I feel that what's more important than responsiveness is a uniform response time.

Then you gave him a bunch of karma, in the process also breaking unwritten rules and getting busted.<p>And before pg says ""it's in writing somewhere"" -- the system shouldn't require people poking around the blog to figure out what will work or not.<p>The whole karma thing gives me a headache. It's supposed to be for good articles, except in the case where you use it to agree or disagree, unless you disagree and you don't have enough karma, unless you use it too much, in which case...<p>Ugh. It's like by insisting that it's a simple up and down arrow we've made the whole thing much more complicated than it needs to be. But hey! It looks simple on the page!

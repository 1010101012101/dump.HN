I don&#x27;t think there is a single point in that piece that would make Yahoo PR the least bit uncomfortable. Credit where it&#x27;s due, the article is incredibly well written and beautifully presented. It&#x27;s just a shame to see such unquestioning faith in a source. One by one, Levy hammers away at every recent criticism of Yahoo. Anything that could not justified was deemed to be overblown.<p>&quot;Some of the various flaps involving her leadership were crazily overblown, like her personal child care accommodations, or an edict against working at home that affected a tiny percentage of Yahoo’s workforce.&quot;<p>Every original fact in this article is information Yahoo would obviously want to share, like the success of its revamped ad platform. Based on the way he has failed to question anything else that Mayer has done during her tenure, it is hard to believe that these facts were questioned and examined in any detail.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I think that Mayer may be doing a good job.

For optimally tuning the machine learning models you may have for predicting user engagement, churn, etc. We wrote a blog post on this last week [1]. More information can be found on our machine learning page [2].<p>2. For A/B tests of various in-game parameters [3]. Instead of doing exhaustive search (or binary search, or local hill climbing, or intuition) to decide what parameters to try in your tests you can use SigOpt to optimally suggest what to do next, given the historical data already collected. Example: if you are trying to find what the best properties a specific new unit should have in your game (cost, build time, etc) we can guide you to the global optima for the metric you care about automatically and optimally.<p>We do all of this by wrapping cutting-edge design of experiments research behind a simple API [4] and web interface. You tell us what you have tried in the past (if anything) and we tell you what is optimal to try next.<p>Any other feedback is greatly appreciated!

9134417,comment,9131923,9131923,0,0,gwern,,,"> Focusing on one part of the IQ test, the Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices, they found that on average intelligence has risen the equivalent of 20 IQ points since 1950. IQ tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100, so this is a significant jump.<p>The problem is, that&#x27;s about the <i>only</i> part that has risen. The limited number of subtests showing the gains has long been one of the big question marks about how the Flynn effect could possibly be about the underlying intelligence rather than an artifact (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect</a>).<p>> This is a puzzle not just for the US, but for all countries demonstrating the Flynn Effect. &quot;Does it make sense,&quot; Flynn wrote in one paper, &quot;to assume that at one time almost 40% of Dutch men lacked the capacity to understand soccer, their most favoured national sport?&quot;<p>This sort of point comes up often, but it&#x27;s not a good point to make. The people discussing IQ tests typically have lived in a tight bubble their entire lives and have not meaningfully interacted with the general population. They typically have even less interaction with the populations of poor countries who might be comparable to long ago. For example, just today I was reading a Wired article which remarks offhand that &quot;In some areas of the country, up to 40 percent of children under 5 are affected. The effects are mental as well as physical. A 2008 study by the National Intelligence Council found that a quarter of North Korean military conscripts are disqualified for cognitive disabilities&quot;. Flynn asks whether it&#x27;s possible for a quarter of Dutch men at some point to not be able to follow soccer well; I ask whether it&#x27;s possible for a quarter of North Korean men to be rejected by the notoriously voracious NK military because they are too stupid or mentally broken.

First, a future with people living dramatically longer is going to be one with fewer kids, at least at equilibrium population levels. Second, it will slow-down social change and innovation. Even if scientific advancements can help people retain their creativity, anyone at 80 is going to be burdened by decades of assumptions. Imagine if the generation that stood behind George Wallace when he said, in his inauguration speech, &quot;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,&quot; were still the core of our body politic.<p>There is no higher social benefit to life extension, at least none that I can see.

He discovered that pre-scientific people can&#x27;t take the hypothetical seriously. That is, if you pose to them questions like, &quot;There is snow at the North Pole; where there is snow, bears are white; what color are bears at the North Pole?&quot; they would say, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve only seen brown bears. And only if a person came from the North Pole with testimony would I believe that the bears there are white.&quot;<p>It seems like the brain doesn&#x27;t think abstractly when it doesn&#x27;t need to, and for many thousands of years it didn&#x27;t. The nice thing about culture and education is that it seems like more than just knowledge is passed down. Whole modes and ways of thinking, perspectives on the world that are useful and revealing now exist in the greater collective consciousness. We can&#x27;t really measure this, but I think it makes a huge difference that there is this idea that everything in the world is not simply magical or arbitrary and that given the right tools we can figure it out. The idea that there ARE knowable underlying principles that govern the universe (even randomness!) completely changes the way that we think about the world.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/03/smarter.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/03/smarter.aspx</a>",1425330842

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have some great words of wisdom on their approach to investing, but I am reminded of two of quotes in particular: “Our favorite holding period is forever” and “Never invest in a business you can’t understand”.  Berkshire looks for long term returns by making safe, reliable investments.<p>This is the exact opposite of YC and other startup incubators.  Their approach is to invest in newer companies with great potential, but also great risk of failure.  The business models of these companies are not always clear.<p>From a personal level (I live in Omaha), I find it interesting to contrast Berkshire Hathaway and YC from a cultural perspective.  YC is located in Silicon Valley, while Berkshire has its headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.  When asked about why he stays in Omaha, Buffett said &quot;It&#x27;s very easy to think clearly here. You&#x27;re undisturbed by irrelevant factors and the noise generally of business investments.&quot;<p>Silicon Valley’s culture is the opposite of Omaha in many respects.  Companies are concerned about chasing the latest and greatest trends even if many founders don’t complete understand those trends. Startups aren’t thinking about the next 10 or 20 years, they are more concerned about their next round of funding.<p>The success of Berkshire Hathaway demonstrates a valuable point: Silicon Valley isn’t the center of the world.  Plenty of successful companies thrive in backwoods locations like Omaha.  This isn’t meant to say Omaha’s culture is superior to Silicon Valley’s, they are just different.

The FSF defines &quot;free software&quot; via the Free Software Definition. Neither of these definitions restrict user freedoms, though the FSF tends to develop and promote licenses that arguably do so (the licenses the FSF&#x27;s develops and promotes are not the only licenses it recognizes at fitting the Free Software Definition, which is pretty similar in substance to the OSI&#x27;s Open Source Definition.)",1425330155

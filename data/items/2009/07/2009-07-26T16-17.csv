724567,comment,724330,724556,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think the common element is that the people around you are the key to your lot in life. In western societies that is being born into some money or knowing people that have some, in China it means the party.<p>Neither of those are a guarantee, but statistically speaking you'd expect people with connections or with parents in high places to do better than those without.<p>Rags-to-riches stories exist, but for every pauper that 'made it' there are hundreds if not thousands or more that don't stand a chance.<p>In a fair society everybody has equal chances at birth, but such a society does not exist (or at least I'm not aware of one). China is 'unfair' because it apparently gives the children of the party bosses extreme advantages, the west is unfair because if your parents have money you're likely to leverage that.<p>Oh, and I absolutely agree that this is the kind of 'leg up' that should be illegal, it's cronyism pure and simple. But then again, so is the 'Bush dynasty'. Or is there a gene for politics ?",1248627106

I just wanted to try to offset what I feel is a somewhat one-sided view of the Chinese situation.<p>I'd also like to point out that, despite how the Western media often presents it, the CCP isn't monolithic. Power swings between two poles: Beijing and Shanghai (Beijing being the political and military hub, Shanghai being the economic hub). For example, Jiang Zemin represented the South and was what we would consider more economically liberal and now Hu is more friendly toward the military, more focused on 'political stability', and more representative of the North. I highly suspect the next president will be a conscious swing back to the 'liberal' side of the spectrum.<p>And the power hubs tend to alternate every decade or so. I suspect when democracy does start to trickle down to the Chinese population, the party will split somewhere along this line. We just need to give it a few more decades.",1248627079

This prevents, in theory, high-ranking government officials from getting into bed on a permanent basis with companies. Note that corruption doesn't magically go away: what probably happens is that you trade off one set of crooks for another. But -- and this is a very important but -- it changes.<p>Some types of getting a leg up are certainly fine. Some aren't. It's a really important distinction to make, because it lets some systems flex and adapt and leaves others incapable of it.",1248626760

China is making some progress, but, still, it has a long way to go. Switching from an imperial totalitarian state to a communist one (also an unavoidable consequence of the past couple thousand years of Chinese history) makes for not that much of a change after all. At least not much when you consider the human condition.<p>And it <i>is</i> my business as it shifts the ""Overton window"" towards a position more on the totalitarian end of the spectrum. While recognizing China made a lot of progress in the past century (making up for the couple thousand years before) it is still unacceptable. Mind you my children will have to live in a world where a totalitarian state ruled with iron fist by a political aristocracy is a major commercial partner of just about every other country.

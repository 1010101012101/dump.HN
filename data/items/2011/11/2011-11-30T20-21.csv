This brings up troubling thoughts of how the web (as well as personal choice and a growing economic disparity) is being eroded by the senseless advance of technology.<p>Recently someone's start-up website refused to work on my Android phone because it didn't support WebSockets. I thought, ""Wow, what a bunch of dicks. Now I have to get a better phone that can run Firefox Mobile or something."" But I can ignore that one website.<p>Imagine every popular website requiring technology that only expensive cutting-edge devices can utilize. At some point you'll have to have a certain amount of disposable income just to browse the web. This should not be the case; everyone on the planet should some day be able to use the internet to the fullest given the most modest means. Even if you stick to non-mobile surfing, is your current computer's operating system modern enough to run the latest and greatest web browsing app? If you wanted to upgrade the OS, would you be able to, considering how old your computer is?<p>The World Wide Web is not meant to be a platform for an operating system on top of an operating system. It's meant to provide formatted data with inline images and hyperlinks. A ubiquitous, universal, cross-platform resource for information. I wonder if people consider accessibility anymore.

3296866,comment,3296277,3296277,3,0,nirvana,,,"I'm in the middle of a pivot.  I think that the difficulties described in this article, while totally possible, are more a result of doing it backwards.  Before we pivoted, my co-founder and I had very long discussions.  As we brought our employee aboard, we made her aware of the pivot.  IF we had external investors, they would be aware of the need to pivot at least as early as us (in fact one of the arguments for external investors is that they'd hopefully have made us aware of it earlier... I wish we'd pivoted a year ago.)<p>I'm sure the larger your company is, and the more staff you have and the more money you've taken the harder it is to pivot.<p>I think the lean startup methodology and pivoting itself, is more focused on a way of doing things <i>before</i> you get all that.<p>Keep things really small and nimble and don't spend years on something before pivoting.  OF course this is useless advice to someone whose spent years on something that looked good and <i>now</i> needs to pivot.   But I think that this is an indication that they weren't ready to pivot more when it was easier.<p>In fact, isn't the whole goal to pivot when you're small and its cheap, and easy?<p>So, I think the lesson learned here is to be really focused on the metrics & nature of your business so that you know really whether you've got a viable business before you hire people, raise money and get a lot of emotional and other investment in that business you need to pivot away from.<p>Maybe the lesson is not that Pivoting is hard, but Pivot Early, Pivot Often.<p>(Not sure about that. Doing my first real pivot here as we speak.)<p>I don't deny the momentum.... in fact, the momentum of the old product is such a pull, even though everyone's fully committed to the pivot... its a distraction at best and at worst, we spend some work maintaining that product (which is where our funding is coming from now) that could be better spent on the product we're pivoting into.<p>Just some thoughts, apologies if they're a bit all over the place.   Pivoting is hard, I don't deny, pivoting early and often, I think, is the approach that will make it easier, and make pivoting later, when its hard, less needed.",1322686419

Whitespace was not significant in older versions of Fortran, and that allowed you to write<p><pre><code>    DO30I=10,100

which was interpreted as<p><pre><code>    DO 30 I = 10, 100

Few developers do, and theres work to be done to ferret out what separates the rule from the exception.</i><p>I don't want to be paranoid, but I feel like what Apple has done is brilliantly nefarious.  They've given developers an offer they can't refuse: for 30% we'll sell your software frictionlessly.  Sure you are giving up control, but how much does requiring a payment form and non-standard, non-obvious, potentially painful installation process cost an indie developer.  30% is always far less than the losses of a traditional website sales funnel, potentially by 2 orders of magnitude.  The App Store simply <i>sells more software</i>.<p>Of course it has corrosive effects on the developer community in that prices are driven down (maybe not as much as volume increases, but still) and control is forked over the Apple.  But what can developers do?  It's a game theory problem.  If everyone refuses to play Apple's game then maybe developers and innovation win, but if one breaks the line they stand to make a fortune.<p>I'm really not looking forward to the day when Macs go App Store only.  If that happens it will probably mean I have to switch to Linux.  It saddens me that the future of computing may be completely locked down, but it's hard to argue against it if for no other reason than it offers the most promise for actually making users safe as malware proliferates and becomes more sophisticated.  Part of me thinks the free software and Internet as we know them today can not last, and if it wasn't the App Store it would be some other powerful interest eroding our digital freedom in the name of profit or control.  This line of thought makes me think that maybe RMS is not such an extremist after all, but merely an equal counterbalance to the forces of power and greed shaping out future.",1322683868

Most block cipher-based schemes for Authenticated Encryption can be run online and are provably secure against nonce-respecting adversaries. But they fail badly for more general adversaries. This is not a theoretical observation only  in practice, the reuse of nonces is a frequent issue. In recent years, cryptographers developed misuse-resistant schemes for Authenticated Encryption. These guarantee excellent security even against general adversaries which are allowed to reuse nonces. Their disadvantage is that encryption can be performed in an off-line way, only. This paper considers OAE schemes dealing both with nonce-respecting and with general adversaries. It introduces McOE, an efficient design for OAE schemes. The construction is based on a simple block cipher and is on-line computable. It provably guarantees reasonable security against general adversaries as well as standard security against nonce-respecting",1322683570

I have read ES3 though, and I believe what they call ""Classes"" are the Array and the Number and the Date and the Boolean and most other globals that start with a capital, and you can find out the Class of a value by calling Object.prototype.toString on it. If you believe ""Classes"" to be these things, then yes, javascript has classes. It does not, however, allow you to create them yourself.<p>For what I have seen from ES5, which is not much, it is pushing Object.create, instead of the new X notation, which you were talking about (as the functions all being classes). According to your definition, things using Object.create are no longer classes, as they do not posess constructor functions (although you could still provide one and make it call Object.create). In this fashion, javascript is moving away from whatever classes it had, and into fully prototype-based inheritance.<p>Whether we think javascript has classes or not is mostly related to your definition of a 'class'. Personally, I think the ""Classes"" are not actually classes, just names for some native types, and the classes (which are actually classes) javascript does have (using the new X notation) should be abolished as soon as possible, as they look like a confusing attempt to make javascript less confusing for new people coming from Java or C++, by providing them with their familiar concept of classes.

The problem as parent-post says is that if you need venture capital you simply won't find it, so businesses have to focus on revenue rather than offering free online services.<p>As far as academia goes, my experience is that when it comes to undergraduate education Canadian universities are better or equal to their American counterparts. But the States have better graduate programs and better endowments at the top-end, so a good student can get a free ride in the States and return to Canada with a prestigious foreign degree that will carry more weight in the job search and that reflects more cutting-edge research. Their counterparts who stay in Canada will conversely have to self-fund graduate work and do more teaching work for lower pay, often getting a separate MA and PhD instead of doing them concurrently as in the best US programs. Prior to 2008, the American economy had always been better than the Canadian economy for about twenty years, so you have twenty years of economic pull as well -- there have traditionally been more and better paying jobs in the States than Canada.<p>That said, there's an old Canadian joke about a preacher from Saskatchewan who was getting up in years and began to pepper his sermons with asides about how he would soon be leaving for that land from which no man ever returns. And how his parishioners immediately understood that he was moving south of the border.",1322683399

3296613,comment,3295856,3296344,18,0,barrkel,,,"Highway / motorway riding is excruciatingly boring, even in the absence of speed limits. I've ridden from London to Kiel in Germany and back a couple of times, via France and Luxembourg, and found it infinitely preferable to avoid motorways, even though it takes 3 days rather than one (long) day per leg. Doing 200km/h+ gets old really fast when you're going in a straight line. If you've got speed limits and intend on mostly highway riding, without a significant filtering component, I wouldn't bother with a bike.<p>So yes, you'll want to spend some time in the hills and curves. Don't start on an all-out superbike with torque that kicks in suddenly at high revs; start with something with a flatter torque curve, like a midrange twin (e.g. SV650 or Ninja 650r) or detuned 600. An unfaired bike, if you don't mind the looks, will feel faster from the wind blast. Most of the fun in a bike is from acceleration and corners, and on the street rather than on a track you'll want to have that fun at perhaps surprisingly low speeds. Taking a tight corner at 30mph is harder than it looks, takes more skill than a long curve at 90, and is a lot less dangerous if you crash. I've had a low-sider on my scooter (it was new to me and I didn't know its lean angle limits well enough) at about 25mph in a t-shirt and jeans (but full-face helmet, as always), and walked away with nothing more than a scratch on my arm and a few more scratches on the fairing.<p>You'll remember the first time a corner surprises you by tightening up half-way through. But the real warning signs come earlier than that IMO: if you find yourself letting off the throttle half-way through a turn rather than smoothly accelerating through it, or changing gear half-way through, that's a sign of poor technique and / or poor reading of the road. Even more dangerously, you can end up learning these mid-course correction habits and think you're doing well, building false confidence.<p>Bikes are fantastic fun and don't let the raw statistics dissuade you too much. You'll see a lot of idiots on the road doing stupid things, and get a better idea of where the stats come from. Filtering, where legal, can be intoxicatingly enjoyable. And you'll appreciate differences in road geography to a huge degree.<p>I've ridden in Belgium, Netherlands, northern CA, northwest France, Luxembourg, UK and Germany, in approximately increasing order of fun, though for different reasons. Belgium has terrible (back) roads and is mostly flat; northern CA has some very curvy roads, but they are often very narrow, poorly surfaced and have double-yellow no-overtaking lines to an extreme; though it does have filtering. UK also has many fairly poor country roads - a lot of hedges blocking views - but makes up for it with filtering. Germany is strictly anti-filtering, but has very high standards even for curvy minor roads, which are wide and have high speed limits (depending on state).<p>(I own a scooter and a big bike and live in London. Scooters are better for filtering in the city, and a lot more practical. I don't own a car, and only ever take public transport if I'll be consuming alcohol.)",1322683256

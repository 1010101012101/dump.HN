No macro language in Perl or anything else.<p>Maybe people use emacs to help make stuff neat but that&#x27;s it.\nQualcomm has their own tool that created register files for sub modules from a MSWord table and it sucked big time.<p>Parametrizing is just via `defines.<p>On the verification side, it is System Verilog or something similar. On top of that is a pile of crap called UVM.<p>For an engineer it does not matter about the language that describes the circuit. It does not matter how many lines it takes to add a pipeline stage. The effort is in creating the design itself, not how it is represented in text files.<p>Typical engineers write hundreds of lines every day when they feel like it. Think of the complexity of an SoC in a mobile device. There are millions of lines of Verilog for the design and the same or more lines of System Verilog to do the verification. Typing it in is the easiest part.<p>The real work is simulation of the design under test running millions of cycles. Say we are verifying the wifi, we have to simulate traffic of transactions to and from the device. Millions of transactions while the design is running at various clock speeds with other modules also creating traffic on the buses etc.<p>Waveforms and log files is the majority of the work.<p>These languages from academia don&#x27;t fix anything I care about.",1431233978

Interviewing is very random. I have sat on both sides of the table. I have sighed when other interviewers have bought up minor quibbles about otherwise excellent candidates. There are a lot of really bad interviewers.

I say this because the advice I&#x27;ll give you is based on what I&#x27;ve seen in the Bay Area, larger companies, and even from a personal learning experience. If you can build an app from scratch in Swift and publish it to the App Store, then you&#x27;re golden in the job market. It&#x27;s always the apps you have in the App Store that will bring out your resume when companies look to bring you in for interviews. With that being said, here are some pieces of advice I have for Swift vs. Objective-C:\n- Learn Swift through the iTunes U Standford course and master it\n- Stay upto date with the NSHipster blog for many of the ins and outs of Swift, Obj-C, and the iOS framework\n- Be sure to learn some of the Objective-C concepts that aren&#x27;t that common in Swift (contact me for more details)\n- Research the common iOS interview questions as many of them still pertain to Objective-C\n- Understand your basic CS theory: Data Structures, Algorithms & their complexities, OOP, System programming\n- Integrate libraries that are written in Objective-C into one of your Swift apps and be sure to know how to incorporate it correctly<p>Currently, I&#x27;m working with a team of iOS engineers to build out our SDK for our service. One of the issues we&#x27;ve come up with over the past year was Swift vs. Objective-C. We made the decision to continue development and refactoring in Swift while maintaining our well written Objective-C code base. So, anyone coming on to our team would need Swift experience and be able to understand some details in Objective-C.<p>If you have any questions about what I mentioned, you can email me: aqadan@gmail.com",1431233190

This being the case, it behooves new governments reviewing unfavorable deals to renegotiate terms like royalty rates or lease terms (both of which happen all the time), whereas unilateral expropriation should be a last resort because it signals to any and all investors that the country in question is an unreliable place to invest, so you scare away ethical investors as well as greedy ones.",1431233107

It&#x27;s actually even worse if there are serious design or maintainability issues, as that&#x27;s even <i>more</i> code to re-write/&quot;fix&quot;.<p>Personally, I really like having code-reviews -- it&#x27;s better to get rid of serious problems if they&#x27;re there. However, I&#x27;ve found a lot of reviews to be rather worthless &quot;rubber-stamp&quot; exercises -- <i>especially</i> if the dev team has just been told Thou Shalt Do Code Reviews Because Reasons! (I&#x27;ve also found the opposite, for sure: getting nice solid advice or missed cases; but these are invariably with other developers who <i>want</i> reviews no matter what management said).<p>...but all that said, I think so-called &quot;code reviews&quot; really work best if they&#x27;re spread out over the coding (unless it&#x27;s really small chunks at a time) -- a bit of pair-programming (or &quot;hey, can you help me with ...&quot;) and design (or whatever you call &quot;early on in the cycle&quot;) reviews make it a <i>hell</i> of a lot easier to take a different approach.<p>I think they used to call this &quot;collaboration&quot;?<p>Companies that just blast out a &quot;new rule: everything gets code reviews!&quot; memo without helping people understand the benefits, <i>and</i> how to do more &quot;along-the-way&quot; validation of design, refactorings, etcetc are always the very worst at having code reviews that are in any way effective. At such places, I find &quot;code reviews&quot; devolve into either useless &quot;rubber stamp&quot; affairs or something like what you describe. Or worse.<p>Also, if you have &quot;Junior Developers&quot; blasting out code for a couple days (or more!) with no adult supervision with a hope that some last-second &quot;code review&quot; procedure is going to equal amazing code, you&#x27;re doing mentoring wrong. It&#x27;s a lot nicer for everyone involved if there is someone sitting down with (or  chatting or watching-the-commits-of or whatever works) the less experienced developers. These mentors should be providing hands-on, practical advice <i>as they go</i>. Some devs might need more hand-holding, some will need &quot;a plan&quot;, maybe you need to sketch out classes or method-signatures for them, perhaps they need a bunch of half-day tasks written down, etc...Such mentoring should, IMO, be what your Senior Developers are spending a decent chunk of their not-coding time on.",1431232833

Nobody talks to engineers/geeks about that. But once you go through the hired.com process, you realize that hey, it&#x27;s an open field -- you can establish up front what your criteria are in terms of compensation and discuss that early in the potential interview process. Because time is money, hiring is complicated and compensation is all over the place. You are the best judge of your value. It&#x27;s complicated. But you are also the best judge of what you&#x27;ll accept in terms of tradeoffs (cash vs equity).<p>Everyone single person who contacted me via my Hired.com profile was a founder (or a recruiter pretending to be the founder). Either way, I got a great summary of what they were looking for along with up front knowledge of the compensation (so I knew we were on the same page). I got 11 or 12 offers and I did 4 on-site interviews. I ended up at a company that I am very happy with.<p>So I recommend it to those that don&#x27;t have a perfect network.

Very few products can completely rebuild the largest tech market in their image overnight.  No other Apple product has done it—that&#x27;s why so many pundits were disappointed with the iPad&#x27;s performance as a new product even though it was orders of magnitude more successful than any previous tablet and made the category relevant in a way people had been trying for almost a decade prior.

The first thing the author gets wrong is the idea that it&#x27;s all his phone apps and notifications shrunk down onto his wrist.  Yes, a lot of apps rushed to release Watch functionality for launch day, but frankly, you don&#x27;t want to look at most things on your watch.  What you want is to show only the most essential notifications, and the apps which have something you might want to glance at.  If you&#x27;re receiving email notifications on your Apple Watch god help you, that is the path to a new level of distraction (I&#x27;d argue you don&#x27;t want those on your phone either, do you really want to give the world more opportunity to distract you?).  My advice on setting up the watch is to first <i>turn off everything</i> and then add the pieces you want one by one.<p>In the end I&#x27;ve found quite a few small but practical conveniences which are going to keep me wearing the watch for a while:  taking a phone call from my wrist when I&#x27;m sitting the car and don&#x27;t want to fish into my pocket; telling siri something on the fly; responding to a text message with boilerplate responses; haptic feedback for turn-by-turn directions when cycling; having an &quot;urgent&quot; level of notification so that I can pay less attention to my phone without completely shutting off a given lower-priority notification; reminder to stand up and walk around once an hour; and last but not least, checking the time is actually more convenient when you don&#x27;t have to pull a phone out regardless of how adept we have all gotten at that maneuver.",1431232012

If I&#x27;m going to buy a watch, I want it to be a watch first, and &quot;smart&quot; second, and I was convinced that only the Pebble did that. I tried the original Pebble for a while -  but lately I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised trying Sony&#x27;s Smartwatch 3.<p>- Its screen is always on, and always readable to me - I&#x27;m not sure about this, but I think it has a variant of the Pebble&#x27;s e-paper screen. I know Sony makes Pebble&#x27;s screen.<p>- It has the highest IP water-resistance rating out of the Android wear watches (IP68, which is supposedly suitable for swimming), although not quite as waterproof as the Pebble.<p>- The battery can also easily last through a full day and night, in my experience, with about ~30% remaining for the next day. That&#x27;s even less of an issue given that the battery can be charged up fully fairly quickly (can&#x27;t quantify that any further at the moment, but it&#x27;s always been pretty quick for me).<p>Now, if you swim, like you mentioned you do, then the waterproofing thing might be a dealbreaker. But other than that, this Android Wear watch is almost on par with the Pebble as a &quot;watch&quot;, and you get a bunch of added benefits (like GPS, which is great for running, better Android integration, touchscreen, polished voice interaction, etc.). IMHO, if you&#x27;re just looking for a watch that&#x27;s got some extra features, then the _original_ Pebble is great just because it&#x27;s so cheap. But, if one&#x27;s willing to spend more like $200 (Pebble Time), it&#x27;s not much of a competition, unless you _really_ value the extra battery and waterproofing.<p>Edit: clarity.",1431231753

Aerial surveillance (whether by drone or by manned aircraft) is an excellent way of directing limited police at actual problems (hopefully before they become crises) during tense situations.<p>As only one example, being able to see that a given protester group was substantially &quot;imported&quot; from out-of-town might change the appropriate response dynamic significantly from a protest where the protesters are all pouring onto the streets from their own communities. Beat cops should be familiar with the members of the latter group at least, but how can they be familiar with people who come in from out-of-town?<p>As far as legality, things may change with future rulings but as of this point the question&#x27;s already been put before the Supreme Court, and the answer is that aerial surveillance is legal -- you just can&#x27;t use sensors above-and-beyond the types of senses a patrolling cop might have walking around the street.<p>So perhaps high-zoom lenses would be ruled against at a court level (things like IR have already been struck down), but as a general principle the law is already clear on this (in favor of the police).<p>> I fail to see the connection you&#x27;re drawing between proles and this situation<p>The proles were kept more or less completely alone to rot in their own slums as long as they didn&#x27;t do anything to draw the attention of the Party. They didn&#x27;t even have to worry about telescreens, they were simply apart from the government completely for better and for worse, left to fend for themselves as best they could.<p>In 1984&#x27;s world that would probably be a better fate than being in the outer Party, but my point is that in the <i>real</i> world one of the responsibilities of functioning governments is to forestall security crises by acting <i>before</i> crises appear. You can&#x27;t do that without at least paying attention to what&#x27;s going on outside the police HQ, and during riot situations there&#x27;s no way to stay aware of what&#x27;s going on in the community by just sending out a beat cop to go make a round.<p>If we were talking about a normal day in a normal city then I think I&#x27;d agree completely that police shouldn&#x27;t just be having drones hover around taking livefeeds of downtown (though it would probably be legal barring future statute changes or court rulings). But Baltimore during the riots wasn&#x27;t a normal city going through just another day, there were literally state military forces walking through the city to help keep order...",1431230681

Single.</i><p>Even over one hundred is <i>way</i> off. There are now 76, I checked myself.<p><i>There is no official count - the article you linked was written with a special purpose. Nonetheless, I took an i386 experimental deb for systemd-219 (<a href=""https://packages.debian.org/experimental/i386/systemd/downlo..."" rel=""nofollow"">https://packages.debian.org/experimental/i386/systemd/downlo...</a>) and roughly counted 77. I&#x27;m not sure what build was actually run (number could be lower than total), and due to the quick unveiling of new interfaces, the number has been higher at one point. Things move fast at systemd, and the fact that you linked an article measuring 204 as evidence for the present shows you&#x27;re simply out of touch.&quot;</i><p>You were close: 76 binaries. Of which the new ones are some extra utilities. Things don&#x27;t move that fast, and they haven&#x27;t been increasing their scope - it&#x27;s stayed pretty much the same as what it was at version 204. I currently have systemd v208 installed, but out of curiousity I checked what libaries it links to:<p><pre><code>  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libsystemd-daemon.so.0]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libudev.so.1]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libselinux.so.1]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [librt.so.1]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libwrap.so.0]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpam.so.0]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libaudit.so.1]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libcap.so.2]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libkmod.so.2]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libdbus-1.so.3]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpthread.so.0]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]\n  0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]\n</code></pre>\nThen I checked systemd version 219 - exact same libaries.<p><i>nspawn isn&#x27;t for production use, or so says Lennart Pottering, numerous times.</i><p><i>Well, then it seems everyone is violating that quite tremendously. CoreOS must be incompetent, I don&#x27;t know.</i><p>By &quot;everyone&quot;, you mean CoreOS, right? CoreOS contribute to systemd, they probably know what they are doing. The man page does say &quot;systemd-nspawn - Spawn a namespace container for debugging, testing and building&quot; and also &quot;Note that even though these security precautions are taken. Many of the security features may be circumvented and are hence primarily useful to avoid accidental changes to the host system from the container.&quot; I&#x27;d certainly hope anyone who uses it in production had read the man page first. If not, yeah - must be incompetent.<p><i>So the fact that systemd, the PID1 which handles both the system state and the OS process state at the same time, isn&#x27;t true?</i><p>Can&#x27;t follow what you are trying to say here. systemd is not a proposition.

As in, you completely and horrendously misread everything that I said and deliberately projected your own biases into it.

I mentioned systemctl thinking that you believed that launchctl parsed the configuration files for launchd and somehow launchd communicated with this to get the configuration info. Of course, I assumed that&#x27;s what you thought - otherwise what was your point? systemctl also parses configuration info. Maybe I got the wrong end of the stick, but given you were wrong in the first place I&#x27;m not sure what point you were making now.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s less that I deliberately misread you, it&#x27;s more that you weren&#x27;t very clear!<p><i>Init doesn&#x27;t reap zombied processes, by the way. The kernel does this. Init doesn&#x27;t do re-parenting either...</i><p><i>Where the hell did I say any of this? I specifically mentioned they get reparented to init(8), and nothing about zombies. Once again, putting words in my mouth.</i><p>In case you aren&#x27;t following along: an orphaned process won&#x27;t get reaped. You stated that &quot;init(8)&#x27;s duties are reaping orphaned processes and handling high-level global system state at best (like SAK, shutdown, halt, etc.)&quot;. You probably meant that init reaps zombie processes - you can&#x27;t reap an orphaned process, an orphaned process is still running and is reparented by the <i>kernel</i> to PID 1. <i>init</i> doesn&#x27;t do this.<p>You were therefore wrong on two counts:<p>1. The kernel detects when a process is orphaned and reparents to PID 1, which just happens to be init. init doesn&#x27;t actually do any reparenting, which is sort of key to your argument as you believe that init should be the process that reparents a process when it&#x27;s parent dies.<p>2. An orphaned process doesn&#x27;t get reaped, because it&#x27;s still running. A zombie process is one that has exited but is still in the process table and the parent process hasn&#x27;t reaped it yet. You don&#x27;t seem to understand the difference between the two, so I explained it. I&#x27;m explaining it again.<p><i>I&#x27;ve had enough of this nonsense.</i><p>That&#x27;s good to know, so have I :-)",1431230434

It's a mistake to read this and take away some homey homily about how ""every customer is a snowflake!"" -- the point is that you should correctly value the passionate customer.  Your marketing and outreach and customer service departments should understand the relative values of ""bought it, loved it!"" and ""bought it, so?""  Those relative values will vary from product to product/industry to industry<p>The comment below at this time ('survivorship bias') is also correct, but only if it's interpreted as a touching anecdote rather than as crucial customer-behavior information for his market segment.

The Fed took over trillions in toxic waste mortgages to bail out the banks, and most of those 'assets' still sit on the Fed's balance sheet.<p>I'm sure the money supply continuing to skyrocket means the Fed isn't bailing anybody out.

The US Government is completely insolvent without the Fed bailouts, it would have to slash 1/3 of all spending just to correct the imbalances in the system if the Fed stopped the QE programs.<p>The Fed is bailing out home owners, investors, realtors 24/7 using trillions in QE to push rates lower to prop up the housing market.<p>The Fed is pushing risk into equities and out of paper by driving rates down, which is providing a bailout to big institutional investors by keeping the stock market artificially high.<p>It's a bailout bonanza.<p>Natural mortgage rates would be the mortgage rates you'd get when you remove all Federal Reserve manipulation of short and long term rates.

Use a good DNS provider and set your TTLs to something low like 30 seconds or 1 minute.  Then when you have an outage, change the DNS entry to point to a secondary datacenter, which would have a static error page or a reduced-functionality site.  There seems to be some debate around whether low DNS TTLs increase users' request times, but we haven't seen it.<p>There are some companies that will handle the monitoring and switchover for you (Dyn comes to mind) but we prefer to manually switchover for the time being.  We have a Big Red Button sinatra app that reports the status of the site and allows you to fail over to the secondary and recover when the primary returns; I'm planning on open sourcing it once it gets some documentation.<p>I think the reason failover doesn't get talked about as much in the startup world is just because it's hard to do and the costs are disproportionately high for a small company unless availability is really critical to you.

We have full, proper meals specially made for anyone who identifies a meal preference/allergy/concern. We happily provide amazing, wholesome meals for everyone so that no one has to bring their own. It is hard to describe to someone who hasn't attended, but we do try our hardest to ensure that everyone's needs and palettes are satisfied.<p>- SigOTrack, Spectacles, etc. Most of these are paid for with sponsorship funds, all of the money brought in from all parts is put directly back in to the enjoyment, education, and venue/food of the attendees, speakers, and sponsors. I, and friends, live and die by what we call the 'value per attendee' (cost of having the person there over money they spent to be there), IMHO that that should always be greater than 1.25.<p>- Swag: Once again hard to describe if you have never attended, but we push our sponsors to provide meaningful and worthwhile items. I, and many others, still use all of the swag they received (Hot sauce, twitter notebook, coffee mugs, etc) to this day. My wife and I coordinate with the sponsors to ensure everything is unique and should be worthwhile to the attendees. This helps the sponsors as well as the attendees.<p>- Community/speakers: it scales as well as the organizers are willing to incur the risk that a talk might flop just as easily as it might succeed. It is the question of do you put people on stage you know will do ""good"" and consistent, or people that MIGHT do amazing or horrible. I, personally, would only pay money to see and do things I can't already see and do on the internet, hence the reason for our speaker selection process (and other items).<p>- Biggest Problem: I can assure no people ""easily get a ticket"" to JSConf. The only people that have a slot at all are the other JSConf organizers who are there solely for the explicit reason of staffing the event. If you want to help staff the event (this applies most likely to all events) offer to help staff. Everyone else is a first come, first served basis -- including sponsors. It isn't elitist, if anything it is opportunistic. This year 75% of the US audience was attending JSConf for the first time, so to clarify it isn't the ""same people each time"". As for the ""others won't"" something to consider is that if a conference doesn't sell out, or at least meet the ""positive income"" point, the organizers have to bear the burden of that cost difference. Size decisions are made and locked long before the first ticket sale (in all conferences). That contract is a very, very scary and binding item and carries with it a lot of cost if the conference doesn't at least make its break-even point. Just bear in mind, in all these events it is a small group or possibly a single person bearing the entire risk for the ""community"" and when it goes wrong/bad, the ""community"" is rarely there to help defray the costs (I know some communities do and I think that is awesome and should be modeled everywhere)<p>The model and concept we (US, EU, AR, AU, etc.) have built is not to be bigger (in fact we shrank in size this year), but to be more widely available through more local events. The small size breeds conversations and conveys a feeling (for better or worse) of ""I can meet everyone"". We keep it small because we are still experimenting, trying different (sometimes failed, sometimes not) methods and ideas.  This isn't a knock on the larger conference model, I believe there are many conference models and they should all exist (or continue to be created/refined) because people are varied and unique and that is what makes these events awesome. There are many events that don't appeal to me (personally) but I am glad they exist for people that it does appeal to. We all have our own reasons for liking things and as long as it doesn't offend/hurt anyone else - I say carry on!",1339107005

And your note triggered a really interesting visceral reaction in me.<p>You can look at life as a series of choices you make and a scoring system by which you evaluate the quality of those choices. Typically a positive scoring system is used so the higher the score the 'better' the decision. It is often the case that people are judged by their scoring system.<p>Examples of scoring systems might be ""how much money did I get out of that decision?"" or ""How many people are better off based on that decision?"" These being centered on the individual describe the 'greedy bastard' archetype and the 'saint' archetype. Most people have a more nuanced system which combines the scores of several systems (is this good for my company? my career? my personal wealth? my celebrity? my family? my community?) which they weight sort of like the ice skating scoring system in the Olympics.<p>The point of the article was that if you're committed to your company and your company's success, then you decide to do what ever it takes to solve your customer's problems. That is because they took a chance on your product and you want them to be ok with their choice. Its an anecdotal story which illustrates a principle, of customer focused execution.<p>When you look at successful companies, you will see that they share this principle. And companies that do not, can be disrupted (like the US car industry in the 70's, the airline industry in the 80's, etc etc). There isn't any gambling involved. Anytime you spend extra time with your customer you <i>win</i>. That customer will relate that experience, win, they continue to buy your products, win, and they stick with you if you accidentally screw up somehow, total win.",1339106958

4081596,comment,4080268,4081340,12,0,trevelyan,,,"You should read Alan Blinder about ""The Great Moderation"" -- recessions since the late 1970s have been shorter and shallower than their predecessors. And far shorter and shallower than their counterparts under the gold standard in the 19th century. Also empirically, the reason the United States is doing better than Europe is because of the stimulus/bailout. It might be hard to think of the United States as a success story since it is only a relative one, but look at the much more dire situation in countries like Britain and Greece and Spain where governments were forced or choose to embrace austerity.<p>There is no reason the world cannot produce the same amount of goods as it was producing in 2007 - there are more rather than less people willing to work and the cost of borrowing money is very low. The only big outside constraint is energy costs, which are being offset by some fairly amazing reductions in the prices of alternative energy, including solar power.<p>So why the mess? The problem is a classic liquidity trap, a preference of investors for highly-liquid and safe assets that results in less money being spent in the private sector. This is visible in the way the borrowing rates of the Federal Government have fallen despite the best efforts of the Republican Party to drum up a debt scare the moment it fell from power and stopped spending the money itself.<p>Bailing out the banks did somewhat stabilize the banking system and probably prevented catastrophe. What remains necessary is getting out of the liquidity trap, which means increasing the amount of spending in the private sector. One way to do this would be having the government borrow at essentially zero cost and invest that money in public infrastructure projects which offer a return on investment. Another approach would be having the Federal Reserve declare an inflation target of 4% until the economic crisis is over. This would reduce the expected ROI from parking money in Treasuries and provide a greater incentive for firms to make private sector investments instead of just parking cash in the bank.",1339106800

4081583,comment,4070799,4076754,1,0,dalke,,,"You said ""99% of the violence committed against Israelis is done by Arabs."" I brought up domestic violence because I thought the topic was on violence against Israelis, and that was a relatively easy topic to research.<p>Now you say that 1) you made up the number, and 2) you're talking specifically about terrorism. Okay, that's fine, but that's a different topic than ""violence"" and different than the ""lived under constant threat to your life"" which you started off with. You did say that profiling reduced terror attacks, but didn't say that it reduced the amount of violence. These two are not necessarily coupled.<p>South Africa, for example, has complex history of people divided by race, and where ethnic tensions and hatreds still run strong. In my 6 months or so in that country I met many people who ""lived under constant threat to [their] life"", for being outside at night, or in the wrong part of town, or while being carjacked or during a break-in while they slept at night. So no, it's not apparent to me that you are saying that all violent attacks, or that all threats to life in Israel are due to terrorism.<p>(It appears even that there are more homicides per year in Israel than deaths by terrorist attacks, but then as is often pointed out, every year over 10 times more people die in car accidents than died in 9/11 - some things we just get desensitized to.)<p>It looks like you are restricting 'terrorism' to state-sponsored terrorism. Surely al-Qaeda is the premier example of a stateless terrorist organization. Why can't the terrorist appellation also describe organized groups of settlers who, in violation of the law and counter to government policy, attack Palestinians?<p>I am not defending Hamas. I am attacking your rhetoric. You use absolutist statements, and you change your definitions somewhat when it serves your goals. I highlighted some of those changes. That annoyed me, and I do not believe it helps you achieve your goal of explaining your views to others like me.<p>If it helps, the statistics from btselem.org are quite clear that a large majority of the civilian Israeli deaths by Palestinians are done by people affiliated with the political organizations of the Occupied Territories, Lebanon, and elsewhere, and done in such a way that I have no problems calling it terrorism. But - and to get back to the topic I once thought you were making - based on those and other numbers, it seems significantly more likely that an Israeli will die of violence inflicted by another Israeli than by a non-Israeli.",1339106523

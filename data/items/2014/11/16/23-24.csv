As far as I know I&#x27;ve never slept eight without either being up 2-3 nights beforehand or being very, horribly drunk. In my experience if you are not sleeping, staying in bed will just make you more tired. It is better to embrace it, get up and do something. So that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from, I&#x27;m sorry if it caused offence.<p>Three days/two nights without sleeping, as in without going to bed at all, should not cause you to hallucinate. That&#x27;s just a weekend. That&#x27;s as uncommon as you might think. If you are hallucinating there might be something else going on.",1416182398

Basically there are two ways to do it. (1) Store it on some &quot;filesystem&quot;. In quotes because how you do it can vary wildly e.g. S3, GlusterFS, Standard directories using DRBD for HA. (2) Take the blob, slice it into pieces, hash it and spread it across a sharded database.<p>Generally it seems to be that if you have lots of unique large files then use filesystem.

Objectively speaking, Netflix clones that pop up but have no qualms about distributing pirated content provide a much better experience for users, because just about everything they want to watch is a click away.<p>In fact, Netflix&#x27;s entire UI was designed with this in mind. All the &quot;main&quot; views try to give the impression that there is a <i>lot</i> of content, yet the search functionality is not very visible or easy to find and takes 2 steps to actually use. This seems to be a rule that applies to many applications: when your home page is just a search bar, that often means 80% or more of what the majority of users want is available. When your home page is a directory, or just a flattened spattering of content, you know that user&#x27;s options are constrained.<p>Netflix is trying to push customers to use their application as more of a feature listing rather than mislead them into thinking it&#x27;s a universal &quot;watch whatever you want&quot;, because they know people will be disappointed if they think it&#x27;s the latter (and I would assume A/B testing and metrics have demonstrated this to them empirically). So they go with a model of &quot;here&#x27;s a bunch of stuff you can choose from, you may not have heard of this show but it&#x27;s good!&quot; instead of &quot;your own personal streaming media hub&quot;.<p>Obviously one can&#x27;t fault them for this, since they have to rely on B2B relationships that don&#x27;t always necessarily provide an excellent value proposition for the partner business and/or are very expensive for Netflix, and they have to obey the law. I&#x27;m also hoping they can work out more contracts with more studios.",1416180259

TL;DR: The Lispm&#x27;s bucky keyboard simply extended existing practice.<p>Emacs predates the Lisp machines (CADRs in this case), and was originally written in TECO.  Originally escape escape would open and close a minibuffer in which you could simply enter raw TECO.  The Knight TV system had a custom keyboard used by us at MIT AI (and at Stanford AI for their own, slightly different TV system) had a Meta key which was used to invoke the minubuffer with a single keystroke (meta-altmode, mapped to escape when using ASCII) which later turned into direct &quot;long&quot; commands (M-X commands) and a wider keyspace.<p>In those days most programs on the PDP-6 & PDP-10 used six or seven bit bytes (though byte pointers could stride by 1-18 bit bytes) but the KTV was built on a PDP-11 which had 8 bit bytes, so meta was trivially available.

The latest Android Gmail app is a case in point. Its changes include:<p>* Garish distracting colors where the old one used muted colors that were easy on the eye.<p>* Thin spindly gray text for read messages in list view, where the old version used much more readable thicker dark text.<p>* When you pull a list view down to refresh it, a spinning circle appears that <i>covers up</i> part of the topmost message in the list. The old version used an unobtrusive thin animated bar at the top of the list.<p>Or take the general OVERUSE OF UPPERCASE in modern design, such as the UPPERCASE MENUS in Microsoft Office and Visual Studio. When developers overwhelmingly complained that they hated the uppercase menus in comments on the Visual Studio blog, Microsoft circled the wagons around uppercase:<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/06/05/a-design-with-all-caps.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/06/05/a-de...</a><p>Ironically, this was a clear situation where the designers were <i>not</i> the user, and didn&#x27;t understand what the user really wanted, but the designers ruled the show nonetheless.<p>The funny part is that the complaints from developers weren&#x27;t just based on aesthetics. Most of us work in case-sensitive languages most of the time. And in all of those languages, File and FILE are not the same thing! The uppercase menus aren&#x27;t just ugly, they cause a speed bump for anyone who has trained themselves to look for accidental case mismatches.<p>Developers may not be &quot;the user&quot; in most cases, but I don&#x27;t think designers are either.<p>Not that I can claim to be any kind of visual designer myself! But I do have a good sense of usability and I know bad design when I see it. I value the times when I&#x27;ve worked with good designers who know that not all their ideas will be right and listen to feedback about them.<p>It&#x27;s harder to work with designers who think they always know best or that their user tests and focus groups always tell the whole story, and don&#x27;t want to listen to developers - their job is just to <i>implement</i> the designs. These designers get support from management who doesn&#x27;t have a clue about design. Management <i>knows</i> that the designers must be right because after all, they are the professional designers and they have all these impressive studies to cite. What could a mere <i>coder</i> know about design?<p>It&#x27;s a crazy situation, but I&#x27;ve been in the midst of it too many times.<p>The weirdest part is when companies who claim to do &quot;agile&quot; development are really following a waterfall model:<p>1. The designers build the design.<p>2. The design is approved.<p>3. The developers implement the design.<p>The designers don&#x27;t even need to know what&#x27;s feasible to implement! They don&#x27;t work in the same tools as developers. They use Photoshop and various kinds of movie makers to make beautiful animated demos - with no idea of what can and can&#x27;t be done in the actual operating environment where the code will run.<p>So they spec out things that just ain&#x27;t gonna happen - and if they do happen it&#x27;s a huge development effort and only after that do you find out that the animations are janky and can&#x27;t be fixed and it ruins the whole experience.<p>Or you do get it done and it works well after a major effort - but you&#x27;ve lost development time that could have gone into features your customers actually want.<p>And all the SCRUM meetings your dev team holds won&#x27;t fix the problem that the Big Up Front Design was broken from the start.<p>How agile is that?",1416179187

Google finds out it has been targeted by a Nation State, who is actively siphoning off user data and company crown jewels, so they enter into an agreement with the NSA to share information about the attack, and develop technology and methods to prevent future attacks. I would argue that Google <i>must</i> share knowledge of Nation State APTs with the US Government, and other Silicon Valley firms, once they found out the scope included Symantec, Yahoo, and Adobe, Northrop Grumman, etc. NSA/Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft/Amazon <i>should</i> be trying to advance countermeasures and leveling up the industry as a whole, because they arguably have some of the most exposed attack surfaces, host most of our data, and have the financial resources and in house expertise to deal with it best. I would be <i>terrified</i> if Google did not have a relationship where it shared intrusions of this scope with the US Government.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8316430"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8316430</a>",1416178927

8615875,comment,8615307,8615322,0,0,philwelch,,,"One surprising thing I learned is that large companies like to mass-produce patents, even ones they have no intention of ever implementing or suing over. Why? Because they provide a MAD defense against patent suits. If Boeing ever sued Airbus for violating patents, Airbus could countersue and, odds are, each company is violating some patent of the other. Also, if each company has 10,000 patents applying to aerospace, it&#x27;s going to take each company&#x27;s legal team a lot of time to sort through them and figure out which ones they can countersue over. Time = money; a patent attorney&#x27;s time especially so. So coming up with as many patents as possible makes it expensive (often prohibitively so) to sue over patents.<p>Your natural reaction might be to think this is an outrageous waste of people&#x27;s time, and you&#x27;d be right. But if you don&#x27;t do it, your competitors will and you will be vulnerable to patent suits that, because of how this works, are essentially impossible for you to avoid making yourself vulnerable to.",1416178907

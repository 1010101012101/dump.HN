In 3 years IOS will power less than 20% of mobile devices. What then?<p>My big rub with HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and all this standards crap is that it moves sooooo slowly. I prefer innovation at whatever speed the minds of man can allow. Now we are restricted to creating frameworks built on top of (and limited by) HTML5 to create any kind of innovation (same with JavaScript) it makes me sick. I saw apps like this a decade ago written in Flash. I know that widespread compatibility is the reason that things like HTML5 win out, that and lazy developers who don't want technology to change/innovate because that would mean that they would have to learn something new more often.<p>What is my solution? I prefer the plug-in model. I think the spec that browsers should follow is one for an secure and OPEN Plugin architecture. If this concept was adopted, we would have a lot more (and better) options besides HTML, Flash and Silverlight to write web apps in. I think of it like this. Look at the iPhone, I picture every app you download as basically being a plug-in for IOS. Each can be written with their own completely different language and UI markup (and many are). Over 30% of IOS apps are not written in C/Objective C. There are a myriad of tools, frameworks and development environments which compile other languages and link them against the IOS libraries. This is how the web should be. That is more OPEN than following a spec that is publicly available, it gives inventors/innovators much more FREEDOM to make the world a better place.",1362048847

5298077,comment,5292591,5292591,3,0,Tichy,,,"Just wondering, when consulting I usually take care that there are appropriate clauses in the contract to make me not liable. But what is the rule for employees, are they automatically insured?<p>In Germany there is the concept of ""Fahrlssig"" (negligence) and ""severe negligence"". Per law you are already liable if you are just negligent, but it is possible to lower it to severe negligence in the contract. That is my understanding anyway (not a lawyer). Usually I also try to kind of weasel out of it by saying the client is responsible for appropriate testing and stuff like that... Overall it is a huge problem, though, especially if the client has a law department. Getting insurance is quite expensive because it's easy to create millions of dollars in damages in IT.<p>Before court ""standard best practices"" can become an issue, too. This worries me because I don't agree with all the latest fads in software development. It seems possible that in the future x% test coverage could be required by law, for example. Or even today a client could argue that I didn't adhere to standard best practices if I don't have at least 80% test coverage (or whatever, not sure what a reasonable number would be).",1362048430

However, most of the available frameworks required a deep learning curve for new users and most users have problems deploying the web app.<p>After using several python web frameworks as well as using other languages' frameworks like Rails, CodeIgniter and Zend, the author came to a conclusion that python is the easiest and most efficient language.<p>However, it will require tools that may speed up development. It that sense, Rails has a very good approach and will be implemented for the helper tools. Integration with 3rd party packages should also comes easily without having the need to interfere with the main OS, hence comes virtualenv.<p>Thus, comes EmeraldBox, an easy-to-use, light-weight, and easy-to-deploy framework.<p>EmeraldBox comes in a localized environment and includes standard packages that are commonly used in web development.

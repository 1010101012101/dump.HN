Online discussion sites are small enough that that&#x27;s not necessarily the case - it&#x27;s quite feasible to maintain a core group of people who don&#x27;t abuse that power.<p>Especially since, unlike in government, that core group of people is beholden only to whoever is operating the site, and not to a popularity contest that sees them being replaced with an entirely new group every so often. This is also why you absolutely can have poorly-defined rules and opaque moderation - the operator of the discussion site shapes what they want it to look like, and if too many people disagree with that vision then another discussion site springs up tailored to what those people want. And if the original operator is too arbitrary or capricious in their moderation, their own site dies or becomes an insular hugbox or something like that.<p>--<p>Ultimately, when people say they want stricter interpretation of the rules and more accountability on an online discussion board, what they really mean is &quot;I disagree with some of these decisions and I want them to make the decision that I would make next time&quot;.

6155774,comment,6155569,6155569,15,0,zzzeek,,,"this article takes awhile to get to the point, but the point is correct which is:<p>> In other words, this is how it should be, that you write your code once, and you can use any supported language version to run it/compile it, or develop in. But for some reason, this obvious solution has been discouraged by Guido and other Python documents, as seen above. I just looked up the latest official Python docs, and that one is not upfront negative about a single code base. But it still does not recommend this approach as the one. So let me fix that: I do recommend a single code base as the solution.<p>2to3 is definitely useful to do the initial conversion of a codebase from something totally 2.x into one that is 3.x compatible.   But from that point on, you need to put it away and not look at it again.  Now that it&#x27;s socially acceptable to target 2.6 at the lowest, libraries that wish to target 2.6-3.x still need to have a little bit of conversion code present, i.e. a subset of six, but other than that the code can be fairly py3k-ish.<p>Armin&#x27;s article here is the most up to date discussion of this: <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/5/21/porting-to-python-3-redux/</a> (though lots of us disagree with his decision to dump 3.1/3.2).  This article has lots of <i>great</i> advice like &quot;test for py2k not 3k&quot; as well as his metaclass decorator that is a lot nicer than six&#x27;s.   SQLAlchemy&#x27;s second py3k port (yes, due to the original advice we all have had to port to python 3 <i>twice</i>) makes heavy use of these techniques.<p>At this point I have <i>all</i> of my major codebases supporting 2.x-3.x.  Particularly, Mako templates supports <i>python 2.4 all the way through 3.x with no conversion</i> - and Mako deals heavily with unicode and Python AST structures.<p>So hopefully the Python docs can catch up with the reality soon.  The original advice to think very separately about your 2.x and 3.x codebases was very wrong, has wasted a ton of time (since you end up porting to python 3 twice), and overall slowed down the adoption of py3k, a slowdown that fortunately is finally lifting.",1375627333

6155740,comment,6152583,6155512,3,0,rayiner,,,"> The average salary for a professional degree in New Jersey is $68k. How many teachers have master credentials?<p>That&#x27;s highly misleading, because that lumps in MA&#x27;s together with MD&#x27;s and MBA&#x27;s and JD&#x27;s and MSc&#x27;s in Computer Science, and skews up the average by the large number of MBA&#x27;s in NJ who make a lot of money on Wall Street. By and large the MA&#x27;s that most teachers have are worth almost nothing extra in the job market.<p>When I hear calls to pay teachers more, I think back to my own teachers in K-8, the majority of which were very average people.[1] Even if we posit that we need higher-quality teachers who will cost more, why do we have to accomplish it in a way that pays all of these mediocre people far more than they would earn in the private sector? If IBM wants higher-caliber people it doesn&#x27;t just increase salaries hoping to get more qualified applicants. That&#x27;s ass-backward. It tightens recruiting criteria, and if it has to pay more to attract candidates that meet the criteria, it does so.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to paying teachers more on principle, but if its something we want to do, we can&#x27;t just raise salaries and hope it attracts more qualified people to the job. We need to: 1) screen for quality the way other higher-paying jobs do; and 2) force existing teachers to qualify on the new scales to keep their jobs.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to pay $70k/year starting salaries to teachers if I knew that the school district required a teacher to graduate in the top 25% of their class at a school where the median SAT was at least 1200. But it makes no sense to pay our existing body of largely mediocre teachers even more money.<p>[1] In a 1990&#x27;s study, only 40% of teachers scored in the top half of the SAT/ACT, indicating that the pool of teachers skew below average in terms of academic qualifications: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/do-teachers-really-come-from-the-bottom-third-of-college-graduates/2011/12/07/gIQAg8HPdO_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/do-tea...</a>.",1375626563

This is almost never the case, however: our average utilization is around 8 amps per phase on a 3-phase circuit.  (Load limits are <i>per phase</i>, not total.)<p>You can also get 30-amp circuits in most data centers if you&#x27;re concerned about it.<p>Keep in mind, too, that your load is usually balanced across 2 PDUs (assuming you&#x27;re buying systems with redundant PSUs, which you should) and on 208-230V power, which is more efficient than 120V due to lower resistance.  If you configure your systems correctly, the load will be shared across both PDUs under normal conditions.  That said, you&#x27;ll still need to ensure you don&#x27;t overload the remaining circuit if redundancy is lost.<p>In summary, don&#x27;t worry too much about overloading a 30A circuit; there are plenty of full cabinets in a DC for a reason.",1375625146

4329333,comment,4329161,4329161,10,0,quasistar,,,"While the author of the linked article expiates the hit coding performance can take when fasting I have personally observed an interesting phenomena during my observation of Ramadan. Namely, I can experience moments of acute lucidity and penetrating insight into a problem at hand.<p>Usually this occurs when I am in the midst of something that requires a good bit of effort such as tackling a thorny algorithmic conundrum or analyzing a particularly complex call stack. If I attune my mind to repress the pangs of bodily need I occasionally feel as if the external world melts away and I slip into an almost mystical state of oneness with the task at hand. Needless to say, I have been surprised immensely by this development.<p>One theory I have is that the blood flow that would normally be assigned by my body to the act of digestion is now free'd up to be reallocated to the ole cranium. Plausible? Unsure, but am certainly enjoying these life experiments!<p>Side note: for those observing the fast I have also noticed that my immune system is closely linked with the gut and my self-imposed starvations can lead to immune system compromise. Make sure you supplement your Iftar goodies with some replenishing nutrients such as pro-biotic yogurt smoothies rich in vitamin C and home-cooked chicken consomme.",1343923129

4329318,comment,4328660,4328660,13,0,MattRogish,,,"Tom DeMarco, of Peopleware fame, wrote a book called ""Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement, and Estimation"". He has, in some ways, rejected his ideas in that book.<p>In this article, ""Software Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?"" <a href=""http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/0709/rW_SO_Viewpoints.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homep...</a> he states:<p>""My early metrics book, Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement, and Estimation (Prentice Hall/Yourdon Press, 1982), played a role in the way many budding software engineers quantified work and planned their projects. In my reflective mood, Im wondering, was its advice correct at the time, is it still relevant, and do I still believe that metrics are a must for any successful software development effort? My answers are no, no, and no.""<p>The tl;dr of his article is that the software projects that require tight cost control are the ones delivering little or no marginal value. That is,<p>""To understand controls real role, you need to distinguish between two drastically different kinds of projects:<p> Project A will eventually cost about a million dollars and produce value of around $1.1 million.<p> Project B will eventually cost about a million dollars and produce value of more than $50 million.<p>Whats immediately apparent is that control is really important for Project A but almost not at all 
important for Project B. This leads us to the odd 
conclusion that strict control is something that 
matters a lot on relatively useless projects and 
much less on useful projects. It suggests that the 
more you focus on control, the more likely youre 
working on a project thats striving to deliver 
something of relatively minor value.<p>To my mind, the question thats much more important than how to control a software project is, why on earth are we doing so many projects that deliver such marginal value?""<p>I believe this as well. If the value of software we're writing is so low, it's probably not worth being written. The high value stuff isn't worth more than a cursory (e.g. Agile ""Points"") estimation.<p>The other thing, which he doesn't touch on the article, is that in order to shrink the ""cone of uncertainty"" (<a href=""http://construx.com/File.ashx?cid=1649"" rel=""nofollow"">http://construx.com/File.ashx?cid=1649</a>) you must put more and more effort into actually ""solving"" the problem. Rarely do estimates consider the <i>time it takes to estimate</i> (requirements docs, interviews, etc.). Ultimately, if you follow the line of reasoning all the way out, perfect estimation requires you to solve the problem and all you then estimate is precisely the amount of time it will take to type the code you've specced out.<p>Of course, what you don't have an estimate for is all the time it took to arrive at your estimate. And thus, the folly of software estimation is revealed.<p>(edit: Lack of blockquote is quite annoying, apologies for the messed up styling)",1343922974

Zuck has the benefit of being a founder CEO, with an experienced exec in Sandberg to help.  Any issues Facebook faces, won't be because Zuck is in over his head.<p>The problem that Zuck (and Facebook at large) face is that there's a rift between expectations (100 Billion+ valuation) vs reality (it's a profitable, but much smaller business).  Facebook needs to either change their belief (or expectations) or reality (somehow morph into a 100 Billion+ company).  Neither is easy to do, but now that Facebook is a public company, they've at least got a chance.  Market forces can help guide them to a realistic valuation, and given enough time as a profitable but lower valued company, it's possible they'll reset their expectations to something more realistic.

It's certainly not ""simpler"" from the perspective of resource efficiency (e.g., it's so easy to spoil Copy-on-Write's benefits) and usually it asks some other process to do the hard work of coordination. From the perspective of correctness, introducing multiple processes to your system greatly increases the number of failure states and vastly complicates error recovery.<p>I think you're dismissing the state of the art on multiple fronts, as is the article. From single-variable STM (of which Haskell and Clojure both have excellent implementations) to battle-tested and well-understood concurrency primitives in the Java standard concurrency library, multi-threaded programming is more approachable and performant now than it has ever been.<p>But the article is oddest in that it seems to hold up Erlang as a way forward, but Erlang is just a different model built on top of thread-based concurrency. If the argument is the old pthread-ish model of ""1 thread per call"" and very primitive synchronization tools are antiquated... then who is he arguing with? Erlang uses actors, Haskell uses sorcery (really, it's fancy; they turn normal-looking threaded code into erlang-ish sliced execution under the covers), Go uses  fancy structures along with coroutines, Java uses Executors to implement higher-level work off patterns, and <i>everyone</i> is using Futures and Promises now.",1343922510

I've used Linux since the pre-1.0 days and been building distributed computing and database platforms since before Hadoop existed; I've seen both of these ecosystems grow from the inside.<p>Linux won the server wars because it rapidly iterated and evolved in a time when a free UNIX-like operating system was desperately needed. In the early days of the Internet, no operating system was ready to be a heavy duty Internet server OS. FreeBSD, started from a stronger position than Linux but development was carefully controlled by academic purists. Eric Raymond's ""The Cathedral and The Bazaar"" was about these two communities.<p>Operating systems, like Linux, tend toward natural monopolies. It is extraordinarily expensive to build a competitor. Linux was the most agile and rapidly evolving competitor in an early market that was poorly served by incumbents. While it took the rest of the world years to notice, it was obvious by the mid 1990s that Linux was on a trajectory to take over that market, not because it was good (back then, it wasn't) but because it rapidly evolved in response to user needs.<p>Hadoop is more like MySQL than Linux. It provided a very early option in a market devoid of options. Technically the implementation is poor and the details of these choices are exposed to users as features and interface. This makes it difficult to evolve the core because it pisses off the early users who have become used to the way it works. Linux had the advantage that it copied a good design (UNIX), which allowed it to iterate the core without breaking too much for users. Over the long term, these poor technical choices early on limit the ability to grow because fixing them alienates the users. MySQL had a strong run of dominance, particularly in the early days, but the inability to easily evolve into a robust and full-featured system allowed PostgreSQL to eventually relegate it to relatively niche use cases that can be easily replaced by other bits of technology (like NoSQL data stores).<p>Hadoop has one other quality that makes it fundamentally different than Linux. It is a relatively simple system that can easily be functionally copied. Making a Hadoop-like clone using alternative tool sets is not a big task. While very popular, it would not require an extraordinary investment to produce an alternative that is obviously superior.<p>Some form of Hadoop will be with us for a long time. It will always have a use case. But unlike Linux (and more like MySQL), it will ultimately be marginalized by its many manifest technical weaknesses. Not only is it easy to build a significantly better ""Hadoop"" than the free Hadoop -- many companies already have -- but there are some very important distributed computing technologies and features which Hadoop does not have and which would be difficult to implement on that platform even if customers want them. The larger NoSQL and distributed computing space is evolving very rapidly with many potential alternatives.<p>The only lessons for Hadoop from the history of Linux and open source generally is that it is in a ripe position to be marginalized over the long term. I've seen this hype cycle many times for products in similar positions. I remember, for example, when Perl was <i>the</i> programming language of the Web. Perl quickly dominated a void in the market at the time but where is it today?",1343921083

Combine that with a good Pub/Sub system [1] and you're most of the way there.<p>That said, it would be nice to see some examples of large-scale knockout apps, as there doesn't seem to be much discussion out in the open in this area.

No. But the familiarity with the brand name and interface of Office (no one can dispute that this is probably the most widely used software, in enterprise and home environment) will not allow them to switch to another office package. Many home users are not aware of the fact that there can indeed exist multiple software to edit the same file-type.<p>I'm reasonably certain that MS even know that releasing Office on Linux will ring their death knell. Although, I do feel it a bit unfair that it's available on the Mac OS.",1343920014

The legend is hidden in it's initial state, making it difficult and confusing to determine what colors are used for the different lines.

Somehow there's too much supply keeping jobs scarce and too much demand keeping prices high.<p>Price is the equilibrium of supply and demand. Cost (the expense of educating each student at an accredited school) doesn't influence the price.<p>The problem is that people are defining ""supply"" incorrectly. Firms don't want to hire just any of the 45,000 law students. They want to hire one of the 1,000 Harvard, Yale, or Stanford students, and then depending on the market one of the 4,000 students at the top regional schools like Duke or U Chicago. The enrollment at these top schools has grown only very slowly over the last century.<p>The price of an associate at a big NYC firm is determined b how much it costs a top Columbia graduate to go to that firm as opposed to a competing firm. Associate salaries thus exploded in the 2000's as the demand for legal services far outstripped the enrollment at schools like Columbia, while they have effectively been cut substantially (due to reduced bonuses) in the last 5 years as the demand has dropped while enrollments have stayed constant.",1343919831

8255464,comment,8255291,8255394,7,0,Nav_Panel,,,"I&#x27;ve did low carb a few years ago to lose some weight and I&#x27;m on it again now to burn off the effects of free startup food over the summer. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found as far as snacking is concerned:<p>Jerky: a standby but actually it often has more carbs than you&#x27;d think -- one 3oz package usually has 12-15g of carbs, which is around 3/4ths of my ideal consumption for a day.<p>Nuts: almonds are the best, but others work too.<p>Cheese: cheese sticks make a great on-the-go snack, you can find them in a lot of gas stations. I also will do cured meats + cheese when I want an easy dinner, though it&#x27;s a tad expensive.<p>Pork Rinds: good for when you&#x27;re craving something like chips. I sometimes dip them in salsa.<p>Veggies: some low-carb folks have success snacking on celery and carrots, but I have difficulty at times.<p>But, to be honest, a lot of my problems with eating in the past involved snacking. I eat when I feel like eating, rather than when I&#x27;m actually hungry, and so my eating habits become tied to emotions rather than biological needs. And once I start eating sweets, I don&#x27;t stop until I feel sick. Having fewer options makes it easier to abstain, as you said. However, did you actually feel hungry/need to snack often when you were eating low carb? I rarely feel hunger between meals like I did when I was eating carbs regularly.<p>My goal with low carb is to get my habits back to the point where I no longer eat because I&#x27;m bored or because it&#x27;s in front of me. I&#x27;m also cutting out artificial sweeteners this time around to try and reduce my sweet tooth (last time I drank tons and tons of diet soda, but I&#x27;m finding that seltzer/club soda is an acceptable substitute) (I also heard that sweet tastes produce an insulin response regardless of actual sugar content).",1409623125

Something that brings syntactic sugar to bash is welcome in my mind, as I always find myself putzing with Google to find solutions to even slightly non-trivial scripts.<p>Perhaps I should just master bash scripting once and for all (I know it&#x27;s not that complex), but I generally find it unpleasant to do anything that requires control flow or traditional &quot;programming language logic&quot; in bash.<p>A simple way to bootstrap the compiler with the script itself would be especially nice.

8255459,comment,8255291,8255394,2,0,Taylorious,,,"Its weird that this pops up on HN because I have been trying a low carb diet for the last 2.5 weeks (with quite a bit of success). I have run into the same issue as you in regards to snacking. The best snack I found was flavored almonds. They are about 4 carbs an ounce and come in a bunch of flavors (coconut is my favorite).<p>I have had a huge sweet tooth my whole life but I find the thing that I crave the most is fruit (I know fruit is sweet but not like ice-cream and candy). I&#x27;ve always ate a ton of apples and now that I can&#x27;t I am craving them like crazy. Also, no bread is really hard, especially since good whole wheat bread seems so healthy and is so satisfying, and it limits your options for most meals like pizza and sandwiches.<p>I hear a lot of knee-jerk reactions about the diet saying how it must be awesome to just eat steak, chicken,  etc. all the time, but it gets real old real fast. Without bread/buns, bbq source, and common high carb toppings, it become really repetitive. Cheeseburgers are amazing but they are a hell of a lot less appealing with no bun, onions, tomato, or ketchup.<p>All this being said I do not see keto or whatever you want to call it as a long term diet/lifestyle for me. I have been convinced that I used to eat way too many carbs, but I think I just need to balance my meals more and do some portion control. Eating no more than like 20 carbs a day is really hard and for me it affects the quality of my life too much. But, I totally understand that there are people out there where this diet is basically the only thing that works for them, so I think it&#x27;s awesome that more people are at least trying it.",1409623080

After the adjustement period of about two weeks you suddenly start feeling much less hungry and the portions you eat become smaller. You are essentially losing weight without feeling hungry at all which is terrific. The only problem is that a very strict low-carb diet can be a bit monotonous with the type of foods you are &quot;allowed&quot; to eat and can be hard to follow if you don&#x27;t have the time or patience to actually <i>cook</i> food for yourself.",1409623010
8255456,comment,8249052,8254767,2,0,jspiros,,,"I hate hierarchical filesystems.<p>A lot of my older files, sadly, are stored in &quot;SORT/Sort Me/To be sorted/Old computer/Sort again/Miscellaneous...&quot; and the like. My server has an mlocate index, so I&#x27;ll use mlocate, and I&#x27;ll use find sometimes. I make sure to preserve metadata like last-modified/created dates, so I can use that to narrow things down.<p>Newer stuff, I try to keep a bit more organized, but I still have lots of unmanaged stuff floating around. For big projects, or big files, that&#x27;s easy enough; my photos are sorted into a Y/M/D hierarchy, my VHS digitization projects are fairly well organized, some other things have their own structure. For my scanned documents, I just dump them all into a mess of folders, but then have a custom Django app with a management command that indexes them and gives me a nice &quot;document management&quot; website, and then I just search based on OCR&#x27;d text or title or date.<p>I really hate hierarchical filesystems. After using computers for this long, I&#x27;m convinced that hierarchy-optional, metadata-driven stuff is the only future I&#x27;ll be happy in. I long for the ability to save things without really having to say anything about where it&#x27;s saved, and still be able to find it... So, sorry, I don&#x27;t think I have a satisfactory answer for you, as I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good solution to this problem as long as we have filesystems where the organizational primative is a hierarchy. Even with tag-based systems that build on top of that, it&#x27;s usually clunky and you still fundamentally have to figure out where to save something &quot;first&quot;, even if you plan to access it via tag/metadata later.

Such people care little for the social consequences of gaining their wealth.<p>The illegal drug trade also entrenches corruption in politics and legal system.

Just as, currently, those who make a lot of money owe taxes while those who make very little money do not owe taxes.<p>If we wished to accomplish the basic income purely through income taxation, all we would need is some function f mapping pre-tax to post-tax income such that over the whole population, income and f(income) have the same average [for convenience, I am separating out for now all other income taxation we may wish to engage in; consider it to be applied before or after this tax], while f is everywhere increasing (so there is always an incentive to work) and f(0) is the basic income we seek.

We <i>know for a fact</i> they are targeted by the NSA, because they were specifically mentioned in the PRISM documents as the probable next target for cooperation with that program. So they&#x27;re on the NSA&#x27;s radar, and everyone knows it, and <i>they know</i> everyone knows it. In spite of this, a few months later, they bring onto their board Condoleezza Rice, a woman who, while she was in the Bush administration, went to bat for their warrantless wiretapping program a dozen times. She hasn&#x27;t recanted - she&#x27;s still a huge fan.<p>This is pretty much the exact opposite of what you would do to address privacy concerns with your company.<p>And in the whole time, they&#x27;ve addressed <i>none of this</i>. They spam HN with their stupid blog posts, and when somebody brings up the privacy issues, the poster gets downvoted, and Dropbox goes silent until their next blog post about whatever wonderful technology they&#x27;ve developed to make it easier for the US government to snoop on your data. At the very least, they clearly aren&#x27;t very concerned about their image with respect to customer privacy, and they don&#x27;t care if you know it.<p>It&#x27;s not like providing a service like Dropbox <i>and</i> providing provable security isn&#x27;t a solved problem. And they don&#x27;t do it. Yet they are the biggest player in this market. My, a clean site design and engineering blog really <i>do</i> go a long way.<p>Anyway, this isn&#x27;t a court of law. I&#x27;m not a judge or a jury and I&#x27;m not in a position to put anyone in jail. Requiring that level of proof to decide not to do business with someone, or whether to associate with them professionally, is not reasonable. They have not been forthright about privacy issues over the past year, they have acted in a way that shows they don&#x27;t regard the legitimate privacy concerns of their users at all, and they have put someone on their board who stands in direct opposition to all that, anyway. That&#x27;s more than enough.<p>There was a lot of big talk last year around here about how people who work at the NSA ought to be ashamed, about how &quot;the community&quot; needs to ostracize these people. Soul searching about what kind of person you would have to be to create those kinds of systems, what delusions you would have to buy into, etc etc. Yet that&#x27;s exactly what has happened at Dropbox - exactly those kinds of people are working there <i>right now</i> - and every week they post some bullshit from their blog and every week this board lines up to congratulate them.

8255340,comment,8254771,8254771,73,0,Wogef,,,"I’ve lived in Shenzhen for almost 10 years (native New Yorker).<p>This article was a bit better than most for Shenzhen- it was at least willing to speculate that a lot of Shenzhen’s advantage now comes from talent and infrastructure. It’s still pretty common for people to attribute it entirely to lower labor costs- which is just not the case.<p>Shenzhen, like New York is an immigrant city. People come from all over China to get ahead, and get rich. Unlike New York it’s only a bit over 30 years old- and back then it was basically a fishing village. This is important because of the Hukou system: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system</a>  It’s a bit long to go into (check the link) but basically it ties people to their birthplace and gives them a significant “home field” advantage.<p>If you are in Shanghai or Beijing and have a local Hukou you have access to the best education system, the highest paid jobs in both the public and private sector, and often a large network of friends and family members in local government. People from Shanghai or Beijing rarely immigrate to Shenzhen because they lose that advantage and are forced to compete with what they would consider the rabble. People from other provinces can rarely compete on even ground with locals- both for legal and cultural reasons. The rivalry is less like US States and more like countries within the EU- but worse.<p>A “local” in Shanghai may feel perfectly entitled to cut to the front of a line if those people are &quot;Waidiren” (outer province people- 外地人). It’s considered perfectly reasonable for migrant children not to get the same healthcare or schooling. The local dialog about them in every city is a familiar one- basically “damned dirty immigrants taking our jobs and committing crimes”. Needless to say the Central Government is quite keen to keep the provinces deeply prejudiced against each other- because it distracts their attention from the real culprits.<p>Shenzhen on the other hand is by far the most egalitarian city in China.  The city is so young that no one really has an &quot;Uncle&quot; etc. in local government willing to “investigate” competitors or send some easy government contracts their way. There is little difference between those few born in Shenzhen and those who came a few years ago. There is no local dialect that is used to subtly determine who’s “local”- everyone basically speaks Mandarin.<p>So for people in relatively poor provinces (Hunan, Hubei etc), with brains and education but little in the way of prospects due to their Hukou, Shenzhen represents the best possible opportunity to compete in a first tier city almost purely on merit. Success here is based largely on hustle, brains and hard work- while in other cities at least 50% is simple corruption (well placed relatives in banking and government). Most Chinese would place the number even higher.<p>So Shenzhen gets a lot of China’s best and brightest, but also those who are inherently ambitious- because they were willing to leave their hometowns and family (a much bigger deal here). A huge amount of the slow grinding machinery of legacy corruption does not exist here (massive numbers of bureaucrats given comfortable jobs doing basically nothing as a form of social welfare). It happens occasional sure- but not to the point that it does in other cities where merit and hard work is almost meaningless next to the right connections.<p>The result is a giant magnet for talent and a massive, well funded playing field where that talent competes with significant rewards reserved for the most skilled, clever and hardworking.<p>There are a lot of incredibly smart highly motivated people here- and that, more than just simple labor costs is responsible for Shenzhen’s market position.",1409620797

If you use CSS3 hacks to convey meaning, that meaning is lost not only to old IE users but also to anyone who is visually challenged. Sooner or later, this is going to become a taboo, and all of us who did it will drop our heads in shame as if we&#x27;d used tables for layout. (Tables were, and still are, a W3C standard after all.)<p>On the other hand, I do want to discourage people from using IE7. How do we do that without turning every webpage into a shiny animated app? My answer would be simple: wrap all my CSS and JS links in a conditional comment that hides them from older versions of IE. Give those users the authentic Lynx experience. After all, it will probably be prettier, not to mention more accessible, than any &quot;graceful degradation&quot; hack that I can cook up.<p>Older design? That&#x27;s too nice. What about <i>no</i> design? (Remember, your site should still work fine with no design.)",1409620068

8255302,comment,8253627,8253821,3,0,jonstewart,,,"I think it&#x27;s pretty rare to set out to hire a wolf, although a manager of a large, well-resourced team could do so just to shake things up. That would be tough, though, since it is very difficult to come in from the outside and perform as a wolf immediately.<p>My own experience has been, instead, that a wolf emerges from the herd after 6–12 months. They&#x27;ve learned the culture, they&#x27;ve learned the personalities, they&#x27;ve learned the dividing line between the strictly forbidden and the mostly forbidden. Your juvenile wolf will show a propensity for  solving long-standing hard problems that had long been deferred or inventing new trifles. A cowboy may act similarly, but generally gets into more trouble and has less substance behind his solutions. A kludge is a hack that works; a wolf is a cowboy who gets the kill.<p>It is at this point that you must act to place new wolves in an environment where they can excel. I think customer-facing interdisciplinary teams work well, where success is demanded, glory is possible, market feedback is immediate, and they provide unique skills to the team. You can also place them on more seasoned technical teams, where the burden of management is a bit lighter.<p>I am a wolf (it&#x27;s been over a decade since I told my first manager I wanted to become &quot;the wolf&quot;, a la Pulp Fiction). There are downsides. The more process-driven the management, the more battles you will have to fight. The wolf often wins, but not without injury. Corporate combat is exhausting and, worse, can become an end unto itself. Also, being always on the hunt often precludes working on a single large project for a sustained period of time. A wise wolf must remember to hunt big game instead of feasting on readily-available mice.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s easy for the wolf to become the asshole. Both proper management and self-awareness can keep this from happening.",1409620025

For one, it forces developers to &quot;drop&quot; bad practices which are now &quot;restricted&quot; or banned in modern browser specs. For two we can bring the latest security protection browser offer to user. How I wish we could just screw every webpage on this planet and rewrite HTML spec and make it fresh and restricted.<p>But, it is important to note that blind users have very difficult time to use web sites that are JS-heavy and plugin-heavy. ARIA is a great solution, but honestly, even popular sites are slowly adopting it and even so Javascript interaction can be very hard to get right for a blind user.<p>They can still use chrome and firefox if the website provides text-based version. But the problem is still most websites don&#x27;t provide text-based version.<p>Shameless plug: I did my senior project on this subject.[1] In this project I used gmail.js which the author did an amazing job of extracting the DOM for us (it was also on HN). I wish a website could just provide these &quot;JS&quot; APIs publicly so developers like me who wish to let people to interact with the website over voice without us &quot;scarping&quot; the API. Think of the ideal REST practice where one uses HAETOS to drive resource discovery. Imagine every website has a &quot;IFTTT&quot; protocol!<p>It is unfortunate, but today, even there are millions of blind users, they have to &quot;adopt&quot; to the latest technology with pain, at least this is what the blind users I&#x27;ve asked before and after the project said.<p>Anyway, my project code is a mess, but it was fun to write add-on and try blind-user tools on my own.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ccvcl.org/mediawiki/images/archive/3/37/20140518041826!Wong_web_nav_thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccvcl.org/mediawiki/images/archive/3/37/2014051804182...</a>",1409619705

When you&#x27;re quoted a monthly salary, it isn&#x27;t. Weird, I know, but it&#x27;s so common here that almost everybody knows. Though i can imagine it&#x27;s frustrating for people from abroad!<p>On a side note, true gross income doesn&#x27;t say that much. You have taxes, 401K plans that are sometimes partially included, meal plans, etc. i had a bigger paycheck at my last job, but my net income is higher at my current job. Unfortunately, the only way to truly know what you&#x27;re making is to wait a month after starting working somewhere, and check your bank account.",1388703561

7002987,comment,7002369,7002898,2,0,Crito,,,"The purchasing power of a minimum wage salary peaked during the 60s and 70s, which has given many people some very unrealistic ideas on what the minimum wage is for, and what they should be able to do with it.<p>It isn&#x27;t just memories of the 60s though, there is some strong &quot;the grass was greener on on the other side&quot; biasing going on.  The minimum wage in 1968, <i>in today&#x27;s money</i>, was $10.56.  Hardly the <i>&quot;buy the house in the suburbs, two cars, and raise a family of five&quot;</i> type of salary that many people mistakenly remember it as: <a href""http://economy.money.cnn.com/2013/02/14/minimum-wage-history"" rel""nofollo"">http://economy.money.cnn.com/2013/02/14/minimum-wage-history...</a><p>Often people outraged about the minimum wage will talk about a &quot;living wage&quot;.  Living wage, as it is talked about today in <i>&quot;minimum wage outrage discussions&quot;</i> is a horrifically poorly defined concept.  Nobody ever mentions just what neighborhood a minimum wage should enable you to live in <i>(Malibu?  I&#x27;d love to get a minimum wage job and afford a home in Malibu...)</i> or just how large of a family this concept of a &quot;livable wage&quot; should support.  Is a &quot;living wage&quot; what it takes to afford rent, with a roommate?  Is it what it takes to afford rent with a stay-at-home SO?  Afford rent with a small child?  Afford rent with three small children?<p>Even if we bought into the idea of <i>&quot;minimum wage should be a livable wage&quot;</i>, we&#x27;d have to specify a cutoff for our &quot;livable wage&quot; definition.

7002976,comment,7001929,7002251,2,0,nairteashop,,,"We didn&#x27;t track vacations at my last company, because we agreed with the Netflix principle of hiring the right employees and giving them a lot of freedom, including allowing them to take whatever vacation days they needed, whenever they needed it.<p>There were worries initially by some about employees abusing this policy, but that has not happened once in the 6+ years we&#x27;ve been around. However as we&#x27;ve grown, I strongly suspect that the opposite is happening, i.e. employees are not taking as much vacation as (I feel) they should, perhaps due to the feelings of guilt mentioned in the article. This sucks because, unlike jobs where vacation days are tracked, we can&#x27;t even compensate them for any unused days.<p>So over time I&#x27;ve come to believe that unlimited vacations days is something that sounds good in theory but not so much in practice, especially as a company scales. I would instead recommend the traditional model of tracking vacation days, but with a very liberal number of days (vs. the typical measly 10 days a year or whatever).",1388703347

I realized in my umpteenth draft that I&#x27;d missed an important detail: violence is obviously criminal behavior, authority figures (in particular) should also be held accountable (potentially criminally) for the violence committed by those they are responsible for, specifically in instances where they are able to but neglect to curtail it early on. On this we absolutely agree.<p>I wasn&#x27;t intending to restrict my anti-violence position to one of <i>just</i> targeting culture, and some of my earlier replies may have implied that.<p>In the case of the editorial that started this thread, this is where my &quot;fix the culture&quot; thing really comes into play. Gaming culture (as perceived by the author, I&#x27;m so far outside that group that I&#x27;m really only familiar with a caricature of it so can&#x27;t personally comment) is transphobic. But this isn&#x27;t resulting in real world violence yet (? unless I&#x27;ve missed other articles and reports on the subject, which is possible). My view is this, if a culture tacitly endorses violence but no member has yet committed violence, it&#x27;s just a matter of time. Some moronic 15 year old is going to decide that he needs to show his peers he&#x27;s a &quot;big man&quot; and go out and beat the crap out of someone. Or a group of them will. By challenging this culture at this stage we may be able to prevent the violence altogether.<p>Your approach is sound, and I agree with it, but it&#x27;s not going to work on its own (IMO). I&#x27;ll liken this to another problem I once faced. Ants in my family&#x27;s apartment kitchen, lay down poison and they left. To our neighbor&#x27;s kitchen. Who laid down poison, and they left. To our kitchen. Only when attacked from both fronts did we drive them out (or perhaps finally killed them, they didn&#x27;t come back over the next year we lived there).<p>Violence is like that. It can be somewhat cyclic, moving from real world, physical violence to words and emotional abuse and back again. While your approach may work for curtailing the physical violence (or reducing the number of qualified principals), it doesn&#x27;t, on its own, deal with the underlying culture that the authority figure either ignored or enabled.<p>So recognizing that violence can develop from cultures where prejudice and discrimination are considered acceptable, we need to find a way (and yes, this is long term, generations possibly) to change those cultures or discourage their discriminatory attitudes from rising to the level where real physical violence occurs.<p>TL;DR: Do both. Create real penalties for authorities and leaders who ignore or permit violence.

It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

I&#x27;ve worked several years now for my nation&#x27;s statistics agency.  I&#x27;ve written programs to calculate things professional statisticians couldn&#x27;t (indeed that seems to be one of the reasons I get to keep my job :P) and just about every useless bloody stat there is, I&#x27;ve written my own probabilistic data linking software, finished in the top 10% of unrelated competitions on kaggle, and my formal qualifications are in economics.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the greatest thing ever, but if i might be so blunt, I feel I&#x27;m at the stage where I can confidently claim to have &quot;proven my capabilities&quot;.<p>But I haven&#x27;t memorized Bayes theorem (or any other probability or math-formulas), despite having applied it about 100 gazillion times.  And despite being an economist, I haven&#x27;t memorized &quot;the relationship between bond prices and interest rates&quot;.  Now, I could try to reason these things out from scratch in front of you, but I imagine most people in our world would see that as a &quot;weakness&quot; or trying to hide the fact that I couldn&#x27;t answer the question.<p>With the probability one, I&#x27;d start going down the various interpretations of probability and whether your notion of probability is internally consistent/justified, etc etc etc.  I doubt I could write the math on the white board of the top of my head in an interview (and i know several statisticians who couldn&#x27;t also), but I could probably outperform most of the candidates who could in its application in the real world (speaking from experience), or be able to question whether there is a better tool for the job in the real world.<p>With the bond one, I know there&#x27;s an answer that you expect me to give from rote during my education.  But i won&#x27;t.  I haven&#x27;t memorized it (because from experience, memorising these types of things is bad form, conditions you into erroneous thinking when they eventually turn out not to be universally true, and is far worse than reasoning, questioning or thinking about problems).  So i&#x27;ll ask you to describe your idea of a bond to me.  I&#x27;ll ask you to describe your idea of interest rates.  Why are the interest rates rising?  Maybe then, depending on what answers YOU give, I&#x27;ll say &quot;well then obviously bond prices must move inversely to interest rate movements&quot;, but there&#x27;s just as much chance i&#x27;ll pick up on some mistake you&#x27;ve made and never reach that point.<p>Now I&#x27;m not attacking you specifically.  I don&#x27;t know you, or what we think of each other, or how we&#x27;d interview each other.  But from my experience, most people/recruiters/employers/interviewers would take my behaviour as a negative sign.  A sign of &quot;stalling&quot; or &quot;evading the question&quot;.  Questioning, or reasoning, or skeptically interrogating things or mulling over questions for long periods of time, especially if they consider the answer &quot;known&quot;, is a &quot;bad sign&quot;.<p>And the rote learner, who&#x27;d just happened to memorise a particular formula or spent most of their time in one particular context, or bought the book on interview questions for said industry will get a big fat tick.<p>Moral of the story: Please don&#x27;t use &quot;interview questions&quot; :P",1388702077

People who you might expect to self-identify as &quot;rich&quot; have tremendously less occurrence of single-parent households, which drags down the national median household income of $50k/year. The national median household incomd for a married couple with kids is much higher, at $80k. In a major metro area, say DuPage County in the Chicago suburbs, the median household income for a married couple is over $100k/year. Second, it&#x27;s difficult for people to consider themselves rich when even with a $200k/year income, their kids might have to take out student loans (top-notch American schools can cost over $50k/year). At the extremes, this phenomenon leads to some people working on Wall Street in New York self-identifying as upper middle class. The median price for a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan is $1.35 million. It&#x27;s hard to call yourself &quot;rich&quot; even making $250k/year HHI when you can&#x27;t even afford a modest home near your work!",1388701915

Up to 316MM from 194MM [1]. This means more people competing for jobs, which weakens the power of unions. Many of those people are immigrants from countries where the US dollar goes a long way. It&#x27;s hard to bargain when there are dozens of applicants lined up, many of which have at least a two year degree.<p>* Market consolidation happened. This means that workers can&#x27;t easily move to another job if they don&#x27;t like their wages. Consolidation also means more competition with big enemies and fiercer battles for margins. Small companies have room to negotiate. Big companies live and die by quarterly earnings reports, and lowering wages is always a convenient go to.<p>* Unions cause obvious financial problems. Most unions do far more good than harm. But there are multiple examples of cutting open the golden goose. Many unions have collectively bargained <i>too</i> well, nearly bankrupting their employers with poorly calculated pensions and benefits. Once a union fights hard to earn a concession they can almost never give it back, no matter how damaging it becomes.<p>Unions are not bad things. Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to get as much work out of employees for as little compensation as is practical. It&#x27;s good to have that balanced by organizations who have a responsibility to their members to get as much from the corporation as is practical.<p>The lack of unions and organized labor isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s ailing the middle class of this country. Capitalism is a greedy optimization function. At the extremes it doesn&#x27;t do &quot;middle&quot;. Not to discuss a different topic, but ideas like basic income combined with increased automation could be like a collective bargaining for every citizen. By making work effectively optional, employers will lose some of their leverage and employees won&#x27;t have to be on the defensive.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/tabl"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table</a>",1388701443

Somehow I seriously doubt that anyone familiar with copyright law would assert that your copyright was invalidated by publishing on the web.

There&#x27;s probably more room to debate that one, but it&#x27;s not clear-cut. What does it cover? Is it applicable to all crawlers? Can you do a general license release like that without your work effectively becoming public domain? What&#x27;s the difference between a crawler and a human reader subject to standard copyright terms? What licenses are implicitly granted in a typical robots.txt? It&#x27;s not like robots.txt is a verbose document that lays all of this out, and all of it is a potential legal problem point.<p>Also, Google assumes permission by default and only doesn&#x27;t scan if you explicitly DISALLOW it with robots.txt. This is the opposite of copyright, which reserves a monopoly to the rightsholder unless he explicitly ALLOWS a certain use. It&#x27;s undeniable that Google is violating copyright law millions of times each and every day, and that said violation is fundamental to their business.<p>And does any of this negate the computer access laws that make a site&#x27;s ToS legally binding, even to those who don&#x27;t formally agree to them?

Even sometimes getting kids to eat food is hard- shall I not add salt, or sugar if it gets them to eat a meal?  Taken to its logical conclusion, their suggestion would shut down nearly all free choices that we make which have marginal risk concerns.",1388700300

Nowadays kids spend probably a minimum of 12 hours doing sedentary work. Now combine that time spent sitting with a diet high in sugar, caffeine, and artificial food...<p>OF COURSE YOU HAVE BUILT UP ENERGY.<p>The recent work of Doctors(mostly Psychiatrists) is absolutely ridiculous and the people producing the fodder for mass hysteria (ADHD, ADD, Schizo, etc,) need to be held accountable for the mis-diagnosis they&#x27;ve created in the society(not to mention the lawsuits they&#x27;re going to be facing when in 10 years we find out that the reason for all of these new mass-diseases are these new mass-drugs))<p>The ONLY classification of &quot;addiction&quot; should be to things that have TRULY addicting chemical qualities that can be proven in simple placebo A/B testing.\nAll OTHER work is worthless because in the human mind, anything is liable to become &quot;addictive&quot;.  I can become addicted to carrots, that doesn&#x27;t make carrots &quot;addictive&quot;(chemically) and doesn&#x27;t necessarily warrant a doctor prescribing me with loads of drugs or classifying me inside of some kind of medical label for the DSM.<p>The only reason sugar is treated any different is because the potential fame and money.

7249912,comment,7202265,7207390,1,0,rickdale,,,"Not entirely sure, cause I have never counted. One of the things I like about eating this way is that I just eat until I feel like I am full. But the only foods I eat are: lentils, broccoli, cauliflower, fish or steak, and then some other random vegetables and good whey protein. Late in the week I might eat some nuts and seeds, and then I might eat a sweet potato the day after I work out. It is recommended to work out in the afternoons if you eat like this, but I like to lift heavy in the mornings and then just drink water til my big meal. Then whey protein after my meal. But everything I do is pretty much by personal preference rather than this guy said to do it like this. I eat candy by the bulk on the weekends too, peach rings and anything mint. thats pretty much my entire diet and for always being a chubby kid, I can confidently say I have grown to be muscular using these methods!",1392595098

Most of the highest-volume Bitcoin-accepting vendors (Overstock, Gyft, Tiger Direct, etc.) change their Bitcoins immediately to USD, which creates significant selling pressure.<p>1.

Moving things by a few pixels here or there is not going to make or break your product, because the purpose of your product is to provide some sort of useful functionality and not just to look pretty (presumably).

7249874,comment,7243987,7249191,1,0,msandford,,,"That&#x27;s an excellent point.  Adverse selection is a real problem because some people can have a very good idea of what their bills will be.  If it&#x27;s cheaper to pay out of pocket they&#x27;ll do so, but if they could save money by buying insurance they would do so.<p>Another part of that problem is that the price is all wrong.  People who have very little risk of dying regularly buy health insurance in part because the premiums are so reasonable.  $200 a year (or whatever it costs) is such a small amount of money for so, so many people that you&#x27;re a fool not to buy it if you have dependents.<p>If you could pay the actual market rate at the doctor&#x27;s office -- the rate the insurance companies get -- you could afford most medical problems out of pocket.  I mean it&#x27;s demonstrably true, the insurance companies don&#x27;t pay out more than everyone pays in so by default we can all afford to pay for healthcare.  What we can&#x27;t all afford to do is pay $50k for big procedure X or $200k for cancer treatment Y.  But those are major medical type issues which we can insure for not horrific amounts of money.<p>The adverse selection problem can be solved in large part by having affordable major medical that makes you an idiot not to take it.  I can totally understand why single people in their 20s aren&#x27;t keen on shelling out $450 a month for insurance.  But $20-$50 a month?  That&#x27;s less than car insurance or a cell phone or cable.  Save $400 a month on insurance and you could afford to get ACL surgery every couple of years!<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: if you want to buy your own insurance you can&#x27;t 1) because of the adverse selection issue and 2) because an already high price would get about 30% higher as you get taxed on that money.",1392594212
7249873,comment,7248708,7249300,2,0,derefr,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s why I mentioned Tumblr in particular. Tumblr is an example of a website where people <i>write</i> HTML, yet <i>don&#x27;t</i> control the HTML that displays to others.<p>On sites where you control the HTML, like Wordpress, you can do whatever you like. Use <video> tags if you know them. Likewise, on sites where you don&#x27;t write HTML (e.g. Facebook, as another poster mentioned), <video> tags are fine--because people don&#x27;t have to know about them, so it&#x27;s all just handled in the background when you drop a video on the page.<p>But there are these in-between web services where HTML is used, usually as one method of several, to get rich text from people, and then presented in an <i>aggregate</i> view (think of any traditional threaded forum.)<p>Because people can do some pretty nasty things when you inject their HTML directly into your pages, you have to <i>filter</i> that HTML to remove bad behavior. And usually <video> is one of the first to go--not because it&#x27;s particularly bad (though getting people to autoload huge videos can be used as a DDoS attack in some instances) but because these filters are usually whitelist-based, and haven&#x27;t been updated since <video> became a thing.",1392594207

7249869,comment,7249193,7249749,46,0,hobohacker,,,"I guess I should out myself as a Chromium HTTP stack maintainer (since 2009, so this behavior predates me). One might consider me a domain expert here. I participate in IETF HTTPbis for the HTTP/2 work as the primary Chromium representative. I am not involved with the RFC 2616 revision work as that&#x27;s tough, thankless work, that thank god we have Julian Reschke and Roy Fielding working on. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I owe them a drink everytime I see them. They do an awful lot of legwork talking to various implementations and trying to build consensus on actually conforming with the standard and all its edge cases. It&#x27;s really quite unfortunate to see this blog post author treat them so unfairly, although I can see how one might easily jump to his conclusion.<p>Now, as far as &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, that&#x27;s a reasonable thought for people not aware of what popular user agents currently do. The thing is, the majority of major browsers rewrite POST to GET on a 301. Here&#x27;s my browser&#x27;s code for it: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/net/url_request/url_request.cc&q=ComputeMethodForRedirect&sq=package:chromium&l=570"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/n...</a>. Here&#x27;s Firefox&#x27;s code for it: <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttp.cpp#301"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protoc...</a>. To my knowledge, all browsers implement this behavior. We basically copied IE&#x27;s behavior, because, IE did it and websites expected all user agents to do what IE did. Story of the web, sound familiar? :P<p>So, as you can see, Julian was merely acknowledging the pragmatic reality of the situation when he updated the httpbis specs to reflect this behavior: <a href=""http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/changeset/1428"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/changeset/1428</a>. And this reasoning behind it is covered in the introduction to the relevant section in the httpbis docs: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-26#section-6.4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-2...</a>.<p>&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; implies that our implementations are behaving badly. Now, it&#x27;s true, our implementations may not be behaving ideally from a spec cleanliness point of view, but interop trumps spec cleanliness, at least from the perspective of anyone who actually deploys real software on the internet. So it&#x27;s probably best for the spec to acknowledge this and officially allow this. Specs that don&#x27;t mirror reality are...probably not just useless, but actively harmful.<p>I hope that explains things, cheers.",1392594070

Therefore you can&#x27;t have the dogs trying to do what a cat can do....<p>Except design is different. As a developer, once you have worked with some PSD efforts a few times and then worked with real dynamic content then worked with a real client to get the thing to actually convert sales, then worked with the client stats you have got a good grasp of when something is right on the design front. Plus you can open the css and do something about it. Or you can open up some stuff on the server side or put in some hack with javascript to get the usability to what it should be.<p>Designers are completely out of the loop after go live, they have done their &#x27;lorem ipsum&#x27; stuff. Proficiency at UX comes from delivering the deliverables, testing, testing and testing. Listening to the client and the customers. It does not come from a few static designs.<p>I have never heard of a designer wanting access to the css to make that 3px change. They are welcome to it. They would make my day if they wanted to do that stuff. They do design for the web and the css is really over to them if they want to do it. The problem is that they would have to learn what a border is, what a margin is and what padding is. It is not difficult stuff.<p>The whole point of CSS is that the presentation is a separate thing to the content. Any developer would be happy to churn out the content blocks and sensible markup and hand it over to one of these PSD experts for them to get exactly to their 3px requirements. But in the real world it does not happen. Developers can dive in and fix something at silly o clock on a Sunday, but would anyone ever call a designer at such times even if it was a UX issue that was the problem?<p>Obviously there are some fantastic designers out there - allegedly - but, in general, designers don&#x27;t do the hard stuff or even bother to work with live content. Far too many of them produce static nonsense in PSD format - a trade that should have been pronounced dead the nanosecond the iphone came out. They also perpetuate this myth that all developers are totally retarded when it comes to anything to do with aesthetics. Yet it is the developers that implement design, learning along the way. Rarely if ever is it the other way around, and, should a designer dare to do that they will get clumped in as a &#x27;front end developer&#x27; and have some retarded PSDs foisted on them by some manager that thinks only designers can have any input whatsoever regarding UX/UI design.<p>How often do you think a developer tests something? A given page can be tested 100&#x27;s of times. Along the way &#x27;this checkbox might not be needed&#x27; or &#x27;this dialogue box makes no sense&#x27; or &#x27;this process is tedious&#x27; gets discovered.

But since all I was doing was ranking nootropics relative to one another, that should mostly cancel out. I&#x27;m not sure why respondents would, for example, be expected to be a group disproportionately likely to have a stronger response to modafinil relative to bacopa compared to the general population.<p>More pressingly, I&#x27;m not sure how I can avoid it besides gathering hundreds of people together and forcing them to try nootropics one by one in controlled conditions, for which I don&#x27;t have the resources. Even professional studies that select their subjects ahead of time have atrociously high dropout rates. If you have an implementable idea for avoiding response bias on next year&#x27;s survey I&#x27;m happy to go ahead with it, but &quot;not collect any survey data at all because available methodology isn&#x27;t perfect&quot; seems strictly inferior.<p>I feel like I hedged myself pretty appropriately: &quot; we can&#x27;t get good data without way more effort and resources than anyone is willing to put in, but if we ran a survey we could at least get better anecdata&quot;, &quot;This survey does not intend to rectify [the confusion as to whether nootropics work at all]&quot;, &quot;a pessimist might say that [this is] extracting patterns from random noise&quot;, et cetera.

Its originally-stated purpose--an <i>application-layer protocol</i> that allows web browsers to retrive hypermedia documents from web servers. In this usage, HTTP replaced Gopher+FTP.<p>2. A <i>transport-layer protocol</i>, with features such as identified sub-flows (requests in a pipelined keepalive connection, websockets, etc.), several usefully-different varieties of caching, protocol feature autonegotiation, presentation-layer autonegotiation (Accept headers), automatic redirection semantics, optional encryption (TLS+HSTS+CORS = probably the most well-thought-out security-boundary semantics of any protocol we&#x27;ve got), etc. In this usage, HTTP basically supercedes TCP.<p>There&#x27;s a vicious circle here: as HTTP gains traction in sense #2, businesses become increasingly unwilling to allow anything <i>other</i> than HTTP-in-sense-#2 through their firewalls. Eventually, HTTP may be the <i>only</i> transport-layer protocol.<p>And, <i>given that</i>, on a stance of complete pragmatism where we can&#x27;t <i>prevent</i> this from happening, only try to make the best of the situation... we need an HTTP-in-sense-#2 that can actually support being used as a universal transport-layer protocol for all of the Internet&#x27;s traffic.<p>What does that mean? Well, it means, for one thing, making HTTP lower-overhead (i.e. binary.) It means making HTTP not only work in situations we&#x27;d previously have used TCP (e.g. websockets), but also situations where we&#x27;d have used <i>UDP</i>  (e.g. VoIP streaming.) It means, well, doing pretty much everything HTTP2 does.<p>Note, though, that HTTP <i>in sense #1</i> will likely always be around. Nobody who uses HTTP to transfer hypermedia documents between web browsers and web servers needs to switch to HTTP2. HTTP2 can <i>do</i> that, but it isn&#x27;t <i>for</i> that.

7249745,comment,7248307,7249332,2,0,ww520,,,"> I wonder how you’d feel if you as a developer were told that every line of code you wanted to change — even those with obvious bugs — could not be touched unless you had previously demonstrated why you expect a measurable benefit to the satisfaction of the business development staff, and that your commit access was going to be revoked and every change would have to be made by bizdev after someone who didn’t know anything about programming decided whether it was justified.<p>The difference being that the developer makings his own changes as he sees the problem, not asking someone else to make the changes, whereas the designer just asks someone else to make an arbitrary change.  If the developer is asking someone else to make a few lines of changes, he better gives a good justification.",1392591721

So to try and fix that they provided 307 (and now 308) as temporary and permanent versions of &quot;this resource changed location, so reissue this request at the new URL&quot;.<p>I actually wrote a post about this a couple of days before RFC 2616 got marked for official deprecation: <a href=""https://aprescott.com/posts/http-redirects"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aprescott.com/posts/http-redirects</a><p>I plan on updating that with more information once a proper RFC deprecates 2616 and 308 makes its way into something other than a referenced alternative, as it is in the current draft last time I checked.<p>Also, for fun, try pointing curl at a server returning various response codes and see what it does with `-X [method]` and compare it with the latest Chrome and Firefox.",1392591716

7249740,comment,7248307,7248878,3,0,etler,,,"First of all, I think it&#x27;s vital for web designers to know HTML and CSS. Even if they don&#x27;t know it well, they should still know it enough to get the basics. The reason I strongly believe this is that the web is an interactive medium. It&#x27;s dynamic, it morphs, it needs to provide feedback, and it needs to be interacted with. You get none of that when you create a photoshop image. You don&#x27;t have to account for users having different display sizes, or the data changing, or the UI elements reacting to context and helping guide the user. It&#x27;s important to have some intimate familiarity with the medium, beyond just using it, to properly build for it.<p>Making something pretty might be good enough for a splash page, but when it comes to actual UI, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;ve run into all these problems over and over again with different designers who won&#x27;t touch or even look at code. Their designs just aren&#x27;t flexible or nuanced enough to cover all the dynamic aspects of the web. They might look great, but they are often fundamentally broken.<p>Knowing CSS also helps you create more consistent web experiences. CSS encourages patterns and re-use, and having consistent pages and UI components also lead to better more familiar experiences. I&#x27;ve been given page designs before where every page had slightly different typography or buttons because they were doing everything in photoshop, instead of something that&#x27;s actually designed for layout, like indesign.<p>I think all web designers should be able to conceptually do the tasks that are brought up in the article. Things like moving a button a few pixels, or changing colors, and little things like that are easy to do, and can be taught in a few minutes. I&#x27;m not talking about writing new CSS, I&#x27;m just talking about tweaking existing properties. Subtracting a few pixels from `margin-left` is easy.<p>Many print designers might not be able to work a printing press, but they still have a concept of how it works, to the point that their terminology like &quot;leading&quot; actually comes from the inner workings of the printing press.<p>You bring up a great point that it can be much harder to integrate designers into a development environment than it is when they&#x27;re writing code for a blog or portfolio. Maybe your CSS is messy, and it&#x27;s hard to find where styles are actually coming from. However, the time needed to do tiny design tweaks is not trivial and adds up. It can easily be worth it to refactor your code in some cases, both for developer sanity and for better collaboration. Also, testing tweaks in chrome&#x27;s inspector is not a colossal task and can be taught to designers without too much difficulty.<p>As for keeping the code clean? If they aren&#x27;t competent enough to contribute directly to the code base, absolutely do not give them access to origin master! Really, nobody should. Once your team goes beyond just a few people, code review is a must for everything, not just designer contributions.<p>Now git? Git sucks for non developers. Hell, it even sucks for developers too while you&#x27;re still learning it. But there are ways around it that are user friendly enough for not super technical designers to still be able to contribute and not destroy the code base. If you use GitHub, have them fork the code base, and then they can use the built in editor to make file changes and add commits directly. After that, you click the &quot;pull requests&quot; tab, then it shows you your changes, and you just click &quot;create pull request&quot;. Then it goes to a developer who can then test and approve the changes without any danger to the code base. There&#x27;s a bit of an initial time investment to get someone not very technical to that point, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Also, it&#x27;s ultimately demeaning and humiliating to have a developer who has his head thinking about tough programming and architectural challenges to have to break out of his flow to change the value `5px` to `2px`. Menial tasks like that are inevitable in a real world code base, but we should be actively trying to get rid of them.",1392591622

So if you sell the ring to a jeweler, he is almost certain to melt it down and recast it.  Whatever you paid for the craftsmanship/design of the ring is literally melted away.<p>The stone is another story.

This allowed us to create the nation's largest New Car Dealer Network, but most consumers are unwilling to pay for this kind of service.

After all, there is no reason to include inline function definition in dynamic objects unless they are called without being inlined or their address is taken; both of which are extremely unlikely for class-inline methods.  The author fails to convince me that if C++ didn't require taking the address of an inline functions to yield a consistent value, real-world C++ code could/would run significantly faster.<p>The second article is pretty much obsolete with C++11, which makes copy-on-write string implementations impractical.",1347998392

The board found, for the fiscal year 1996/1997, that the total amount spent on cancer research funding was US$5.165 billion. The three major contributors were (1) federal funding, US$3.060 billion (almost entirely from National Cancer Institute); (2) industry funding, US$1.6 billion; and (3) funding by nonprofit organisations (e.g., Howard Hughes Medical Institute, American Cancer Society, Komen Foundation), US$305 million.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1513045/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1513045/</a><p>So, for cancer at least, government and charity funding combined, dwarfs the amount spent by the pharmaceutical industry on research in the US.",1347996729

But just some thoughts.<p>Consider a situtuation where you don't know the productivity of X and its subject to 25x variance, a project manager is unlikely to structure a project to allow for 25x variance as acceptable.  He's eaither at risk of sandbagging or falling massively short. And so upsetting other parts of the business. So, he needs to have more like a 50% [edit: I like chuck's 3x also] plus or minus understanding of what he can <i>deliver</i>.  So, its really hard to pay 25x when you are going to constrain his performance to 1.5x.  Likewise, its hard to restructure your projects for 25x as the expected case, unless you have really good data.  But, most of the data will be 1.5x ceiling (if he is maxing performance under the previous example).  So, its still a leap of faith to restructure projects around 25x expected performance from 1.5x data (order of magnitude jump).<p>But, for a founder this is not so constrained.  There it is a lot easlier to structure your work at your peak capacity.  With equity, you will benefit from the performance, etc.  But this is true wether or not you are an engineer or whatever else expertise. So, one theory might be that the top employees are the ones that allow the founders to do precisely that -- franchise players that allow strategy to be developed around a 10x or 25x performance envelope--but for the market to be efficient, two things need to happen.  There needs to be reliable data of 25x performance, and there need to be jobs that can be structured around this expectation.  Without upsetting the apple cart of exectution with the rest of the biz guys (marketing/bd/sales/ etc).<p>And bridging those gaps in the data is the hard part about talent search.

I first heard about the potential benefits of MDMA in therapy at a talk by David Nutt some years ago, but he was skeptical that we would be able to investigate it further because of tough restrictions around research into illegal drugs.<p>In case anyone is not already aware, David Nutt was the head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), a scientific advisory body to the UK government. In 2009 he published an editorial comparing the harm from taking ecstasy (MDMA) to the harm from horse riding (in short, you can make a powerful case that horse riding is much more dangerous than taking ecstasy). In October 2009 he was dismissed from his position, because ""he cannot be both a government adviser and a campaigner against government policy.""<p>In my view it was a terrible decision by the UK government, and showcased their reluctance to make evidence-based decisions on politically charged subjects (like drugs, prison sentences, immigration etc). Since then, David Nutt has formed the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD), whose website [1] is well worth visiting if you want the most up to date and scientifically reliable information on drugs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drugscience.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugscience.org.uk/</a>",1347994854

I miss interfaces/abstract-classes, type checking, etc. I know they aren't necessary - but I'm human and make more than my share of stupid mistakes (and I prefer my mistakes be caught at compile time). Unit testing/etc alleviate the pain to the degree - but it requires a lot of discipline to maintain good coverage.<p>The real trick is that I'm probably faster in Lisp than anything else, but I've met Python and Haskell hackers who are just as fast as I am - so it must be possible to use those languages well (you might argue that they'd be even better in Lisp ;-)).",1259776681

972493,comment,972342,972402,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>[It] creates a cleaner language and forces people to think Pythonic when programming in Python.</i><p>The question is whether ""Pythonic,"" as the community defines it today, is optimal in all cases. As an analogue, there have been enough talks about things the Java community considers to be stylistically optimal that look really horrible compared to implementations in other languages -- like Python. :-) Pythonic style should be a guide, not an edict, and should be deviated from or redefined when it makes sense. The examples riobard provided already show the syntax weighing things down, a situation where syntax should give way to a more functional style approach.<p>As for it creating a cleaner language, I try to approach this, as with all things, from the perspective of being an language-agnostic programmer. From that perspective, I do like the python syntax for simple things like what you defined, but under heavier weight mapping and filtering operations, the map/filter function call syntax seems a <i>lot</i> cleaner. There's nothing wrong with syntactic sugar, but I would assert that it will tend to suck when it is <i>all</i> you have.",1259776369

972488,comment,972342,972342,0,0,frig,,,"It depends slightly on how you came to functional programming.<p>You can arguably trace Python's list comprehension syntax all the way back to setl, a ""set-theoretic programming language"", and the resemblance to mathematical set-builder notation is intentional; compare<p>- let B = { g(a) s.t. | a \in A and f(a) holds}<p>- B = [g(a) for a in A if f(a)]<p>If you're used to thinking in sets having to decompose into ""maps"" and ""filters"" is a speedbump; easy to do but nice to avoid.<p>Where list comprehensions really start to shine is making it comparatively trivial to pull from multiple source collections without a lot of ugly machinery:<p><pre><code>    [{'widget':w,'sprocket':s,'location':l} for w in widgets for s in sprockets for l in locations if l.hasInStock(w) and l.hasInStock(s) and w.isUsableWith(s)]\n</code></pre>\n...which is about where explicit map + filter start to become annoying. You can use:<p><pre><code>    map(lambda i: {'widget':i[0], 'sprocket':i[1], 'location':i[2]}, filter(lambda i: i[2].hasInStock(i[0]) and i[2].hasInStock(i[1]) and i[0].isUsableWith(i[1]), itertools.product(widgets,sprockets,locations)))\n</code></pre>\n...but to my eyes that is not only very ugly but just going by character count the # of characters given over to keywords (map, lambda, filter) instead of ""what i'm doing here"" is huge. Additionally use of itertools forces use of tuples for your intermediate values and thus the lambdas are gobbledegook until you get to the tail end of the statement and see that i[0] == widget, i[1] == sprocket, and i[2] == location. I could define some constants (WIDGET = 0, SPROCKET = 1, LOCATION = 2, etc) but now it's even longer.<p>It gets even worse if you try to be clever with the sequence of operations.<p>You might look at that definition and say lo! I can pre-filter out stuff not in stock at each location and make things more efficient. Naively you'd wind up with:<p><pre><code>  map(lambda d: {'location':d[0], 'widget':d[1], 'sprocket':d[2]}, flatten(map(lambda l: list(filter(lambda p: p[1].isUsableWith(p[2]), itertools.product([l],filter(lambda w: l.hasInStock(w), widgets), filter(lambda s: l.hasInStock(s), sprockets)))), locations))) #nb must-supply-you-own-flatten-method\n</code></pre>\nUnder some circumstances that might be substantially faster than the previous approach. But compare the equivalent but you could have instead gone with:<p><pre><code>    [{'widget':w,'sprocket':s,'location':l} for l in locations for w in [widget for widget in widgets if l.hasInStock(widget)] for s in [sprocket for sprocket in sprockets if l.hasInStock(sprocket)] if w.isUsableWith(s)]\n</code></pre>\nSo you lose a little flexibility in simple cases at in exchange for increasing the scope of what you can get away with as ""readable"" one-liners.",1259776243

But I wouldn't say<p><pre><code>    [each for each in [expensive_call(x) for x in seq] if cond(each)]\n</code></pre>\nis more readable than<p><pre><code>    filter(cond, map(expensive_call, seq))\n</code></pre>\nat least for functional-thinking minds. The level of thinking in abstract is different here.<p>Now the problem is, some people see Python as a very functional language (with first-class functions etc) and want to use it that way (like Lisp), but BDFL and some core Python devs believe it is better to keep it Pythonic, thus those functional people are kinda pissed off by this and switch away from Python.<p>Personally I don't think it will make Python a lot cleaner to remove two auxiliary functions and force people to use list comprehension when it is completely trivial to add these missing pair back (two lines of code).<p>(disclosure: I prefer FP, but I also think keeping things Pythonic is fine most of the time.

972423,comment,972248,972248,0,0,mahmud,,,"Did you really <i>choose</i> Lisp over alternatives?<p>Before learning CL I was a fairly decent, C, C++ and Perl programmer. Did assembly, Pascal, TCL and Awk. Up to that point, I always had to pause a for a minute when starting a new project/script, think about its scope, and <i>choose</i> a language based on the necessary performance, development speed, expressiveness, available libraries, etc. (and whether whoever was going to read the code afterward knew the language; C was often a natural choice for code shared with others on Unix, C++ for MFC/COM, Perl for sysadmin stuff, and TCL and Awk for my own tools.)<p>I learned Lisp in over a month, to spite someone (I dared a notorious troll I would write an AI bot of his choice if he stopped spamming us, youthful bravado for sure, and I lost the bet) While researching ""AI"" I came across Winston and Horn's ""Common Lisp"", then the hyperspec, then a few more books over the course of a month. I sat down with SICP and did the exercises on my break, while I was in school and waiting tables.<p>After I learned it however, specially with CLOS, there was no contest. Three months after buying Sonya Keene's CLOS book it was fair to say I <i>forgot</i> all other programming languages. There were no more ""projects""; I no longer had to sketch out designs on paper or do ""requirement analysis"" (something I was told in school was necessary for all software.) For once, the great ideas in my head were a new emacs buffer away. I could write code faster than I would in Perl, Awk or TCL, it ran as fast as C++, and it was more expressive than the English in my head. I could type ""commands"" into a shell get a dialog embedded in my window, a few more commands and it would move to the upper right corner, I could change its name property and add text to it, then I could fold that dialog box into a menu-item named ""Help"" in the menubar and call that dialogbox ""About"". Amazing.<p>I went on hacking like this for about year when I realized I was doing the ""wrong thing"". You see, I have been using CMUCL with its builtin editor and writing GUI applications in Motif (it was 2001 and Motif wasn't open source yet, so I got the hang on Lesstif and learned its quirks.) Right around this time, Linux GUIs were maturing and people were being snobs about their Enlightenment themes and dissing each other over their choices of Windows Manager. So I was peer-pressured into learning DHTML and Web Design. I read comp.lang.lisp and those too were snobbish condescending idiots who flamed everyone, specially competent programmers whose work I admired (including Scott McKay and Robert Fahlman (the very people who gave me my CMUCL.))<p>It was really hard to be a Lisper for a while, specially a young impressionable one who read cll uncritically; news of corporate giants coming with new tools and programming languages to enslave humanity were abound. First C++, then Java, then XML, and finally .NET. You literally had to pick your battles and choose a corporate sponsor or you would have no future in computing! (you think I am kidding?) cll is all doom and gloom, and of course, there is the obligatory stabs at Lisp vendors by Open Source proponents, and stabs at Open Source for people alleging it's killing our beloved vendors. Every once in a while there was news of a Lisp dialect that's going to kill Common Lisp (Smalltalk, Dylan, and the ancient religions of Mesopotamia.)<p>Fuck, that was painful.<p>All the while I was following this 4-year long intellectual funeral, becoming ever more ""hardcore"" and learning mathematics, there was a small group of ""Yobos"" silently kicking ass and churning out great software. CMUCL got forked to SBCL, added unicode support and threads, not to mention easy building, SLIME was a new Emacs mode better than anything before and since, Cliki was launched, C-L.net, and the #lisp IRC channel was born and hit puberty overnight. Perfect ecosystem.<p>Today, Lisp is nothing like what it was 8,7,6, even 2 years ago. It's not just ""good"" in the well-explored text book fashion; no, it's _good shit_. Get work done good. Think, hack, ship, bill for it good. 2-3 products per month good. You still have to know where things are, who is working on what, what's maintained and what's obsoleted by what. Sure.

8371302,comment,8370321,8371082,13,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Can&#x27;t we go back to that, preferably without the sexism this time?<p>No. The sexism is what made it work. If society permits both spouses to work then couples where both spouses work can afford to pay more for a house which increases the price of housing (and likewise for everything else). As more two income families come to exist it thereby becomes more difficult to sustain a family on a single income, which further exacerbates the problem by increasing the incentive to become a two income family (and thus the number of two income families inducing price inflation).<p>The only way to prevent that is for society to somehow discourage couples from both working full time jobs. And since employers have no way to tell what an employee&#x27;s spouse is doing all day, the most effective social enforcement method is sexism. (Obviously the math doesn&#x27;t care which sex is inhibited from working but existing culture is a different matter.)<p>Probably the closest you could get to it without the sexism is to provide everyone with a basic income.[1] A spouse who didn&#x27;t work full time would still receive the basic income which would significantly reduce the income inequality between single income and dual income families, thereby reducing the pressure for both spouses to work and making single income families more practical.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income</a>",1411704732

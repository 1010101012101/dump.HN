I must have tried it for my typical 30 seconds to conclude ""meh"" and moved on, then forgot it. I'm still not 100% sure what they do beyond ... note taking?<p>But I initially assumed it to be ballsy phishing, a brazen attempt to capitalize on Evernote's current trouble. Why? BECAUSE IT HAS A FUCKING LINK TO THE SERVICE IN THE EMAIL! That's the very minimum definition of phishing. Sheesh!<p>I hovered over it, saw that it was to evernote, but hovers can be faked, and my intuition and experience told me that this smells like phishing no matter what. Sheesh.",1362333550

While you've described iron gall ink nicely, india ink (lampblack suspended in dilute shellac) would be a paint under your definition, as would many printers' inks (pigments ground into an oil or polymer binder), especially those used for serigraphy. Soaking in isn't necessarily a characteristic of inks either; they are often brittle films (which is why palimpsests existold ink was merely scraped off of the parchment/vellum and the ground reused). By the same token, watercolours (which are pretty much universally regarded as paints) <i>do</i> soak into unsized papers.<p>This is another one of those ""where do you draw the line"" questions where the line is rather broad and ill-defined. It's a continuum. When it comes right down to it, the intended purpose and traditional usage in the field determine what is an ink, what is a paint and what is a stain.",1362333532

Seasoned C++ hackers will miss templates dearly (no, interfaces are not a replacement for templates, they are a replacement for abstract base classes) and C/C++ programmers dislike the lack of control over memory management. If you are using C or C++ in 2012, you probably have good reasons and Go mostly sacrifices the advantages of C and C++.<p>Someone who is familiar enough with Haskell, ML, or Scala, will dislike the fact that Go practically ignored (or rejected?) two or three decades of research an programming languages. From the perspective of PL research, Go is a weak language.<p>In other words, the low-level and strong typing crowds are not that much interested in Go. If there is a new imperative language that does interest them, it is probably Rust.<p>The question is, who does switch to Go? One would guess that these are mostly Python and Ruby programmers who have never written much C, C++, or Haskell, and are looking for something faster and compiled. Yes, this is a generalization, and there are plenty of exceptions. Not exactly the 'Python paradox', 'better than the rest', programmers.<p>Following the Google+ community, discussions on HN, and to an extend the Go mailing lists, confirms those suspicions. There are lot of grandiose claims supporting Go (one of my personal pet peeves are people claiming that 'Go interfaces are like Haskell typeclasses'). But if you look at the language spec, there is not much interesting. Goroutines are nice, but they are just green threads. Channels have been done elsewhere.<p>Go is just a very boring language (which isn't necessarily bad), pretty much like Java, without the good package management (no versioning), good IDEs, broad library support, or a performant garbage collector.<p>Boring languages attract more mediocre programmers than great programmers.<p>Edit: if you downvote, please, at least leave a comment ;).",1362332741

You can be a Linux kernel hacker, make it more stable, more safe, more secure. You can be an iOS hacker, make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to. Not authorized, but no illegal.<p>Then you have some of these guys. What they do is very similar to our creative process. They connect disparate information and they bring it together in a way that a security analysis doesn't expect. It doesn't make them good people, but it's at the heart of engineering, the heart of a creative community, an innovative community.<p>The open source community, the basic ethos of it, is take what other people do, make it better, give it back so we all rise further.

We can continue to merely enumerate possible error scenarios until the heat death of the universe, and we will still miss some.<p>It is ""human error"" for an operations team to not put in place methods for ensuring their systems stay up within agreed parameters.<p>But the reality is that it is not even theoretically possible for us to engineer a system which can guarantee no downtime. Furthermore, no organization is willing to pay the bill to address even a relatively small fraction of the problems we <i>can</i> easily predict for the reason that many even relatively likely reasons are more expensive to protect against than is worth.<p>So to begin with, we can't prevent failure. And even if we could, what from the outside looks like human error is often internally a result of either intentional budgetary constraints, or unintended consequences of lack of resources.<p>It is not about lack of responsibility. It about dispelling the fantasy that there is someone who is guilty of not doing their job correctly behind every failure.<p>That is not to say that there might not have been unacceptable human errors in <i>this specific case</i>. But that is entirely besides the point.<p>> but not so in this case?<p>I thought it was pretty clear that my comment applied to the general statement that ""human error is unacceptable"", but perhaps not. I explicitly wrote ""It's very well possible that Cloudflare messed up here"" because I didn't want to speculate on whether the specific problems in this case before the causes were even known.<p>> Most of all, what I dont like is universal get outs.<p>They are not ""universal get outs"". Nobody is going to say it is acceptable if the error is caused by someone bringing coffee into the ops room and spilling it all over the single server, for example. But there is a <i>vast</i> range between someone who is grossly negligent and/or incompetent and who should bear the blame, and someone who is doing their job as best as is reasonable given the resources available to them, but who still makes mistakes or oversights or simply don't have the time or resources to address some reasonably unlikely issue that eventually happens to cause downtime.",1362330502

One of the attractions to the language for me is that it's straightforward to pick up. Because there aren't a lot of ""fancy"" features in the language like Linq or list comprehensions, it's easy to dive into a block of code and figure out what's going on without requiring a lot of background knowledge.<p>The language eschews some brevity in exchange for clarity, which gives me a lot of confidence that I can take a good developer from any background, give them a week and feel like they've got a decent chance of acquiring the knowledge they need to work with the language.<p>The newness of the language means that there isn't a huge ecosystem of libraries available, BUT the standard lib is pretty damn great, and there are more and more people coming to the language every day.<p>My favorite thing about go is it's overall sense of boringness - Go code seems very predictable. There's a culture of digging into the source throughout the community, and tools like go fmt & go vet ensure that most code looks similar.<p>It'd be worth spending a week with it to write something useful to get a sense of whether or not you truly like it, but my experience has been very positive so far.",1362330100

Yes, then it's 99% IIS with ASP.Net.<p>So that's not what I, or I would think any reasonable developer, would considered even a vague security concern as an experienced developer with exposure to a few different frameworks can often tell the platform, and thus the probable server, by just looking at the HTML.<p>If it were a serious security concern MS would have patched the header by now! Instead they've added even more with MVC.<p>So are there any other reasons? Or is Troy just wrong in this instance?",1367854244

The Big Bang Theory says <i>nothing</i> about what initiated it. The theory <i>begins</i> microseconds <i>after</i> the initial event that triggered the expansion of the universe. Seriously, look it up. You will be surprised. Also, there is no scientific theory regarding the origin or the initiating event of the Big Bang. This is what I refer to when I say that science says ""we don't know"".<p>>I asked you very specifically about the role of randomness as the catalyst vs there being an intelligent impetus.<p>Here, I'll answer this right now. The question can be broken down to: which is more probable, that a self-catalyzing molecule formed randomly or that an intelligent being created life in the form that we see today (if it were just going to use evolution then that intelligent being brings nothing to the table).<p>Well, assuming a god-like entity, it would require a near infinite level of complexity, all of which must have come from somewhere. Thus we are making massive assumptions, all of which reduce the probability of this event in proportion.<p>Now lets consider the self-catalyzing molecule. We know that chains of amino acids form spontaneously. We don't know what such a self-catalyzing molecule would look like, or how many units it would need to do its job. Thus we don't know the probability of it forming spontaneously. But it's certainly less than the probability of an infinitely powerful god-like (from our perspective) creature. Further, lets consider that perhaps the whole of the earth was filled with these building-block molecules, and thus the potential for this unlikely reaction was playing out in millions or billings of locations simultaneously and continuously. I think its pretty clear at this point the relative likelihood of the two events in question. Once the self-replicating molecule formed, the primordial environment would exponentially fill with this molecule, the process of evolution by natural selection takes hold and thus the process of increasing complexity is self-sustaining.<p>>Sigh. This is tedious.<p>At least we agree on one thing!",1367853558

So comparing the crack structure between them after similar impacts probably wouldn't give you the same information about the energy input.  Which might be the point, but it appears they're comparing apples & oranges, so lessons learned in glass vs. lessons learned with polymers wouldn't be transferable.<p>Also - automobile windshield glass is laminated (to prevent shards of broken glass flying around the inside of your car), and there are different materials used for the laminating plastic & adhesive, depending on the ""recipe"" chosen by the manufacturer.

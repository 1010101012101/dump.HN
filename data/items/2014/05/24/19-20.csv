We&#x27;re profitable and growing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t have problems. I am the technical co-founder while the other two handle operations and the business development side. However, they seem to be just going with the flow while I on the other hand am pouring my blood, sweat, and tears into this company. And I feel my work isn&#x27;t being respected because they have unrealistic demands and sometimes complain about things not working or things not being done while they on the other hand aren&#x27;t making any effort to see how they can help. It&#x27;s easy for them to just delegate their tasks to our assistants but for my work, it isn&#x27;t so easy. They should be hustling and trying to grow the company with their free time, but they aren&#x27;t. My resentment has been growing against them and lately it&#x27;s been putting a strain on our relationship. I think us starting out as friends has made us avoid talking about the deep issues that underly this predicament. In the end, I can&#x27;t do this without them and they can&#x27;t do it without me. How can I approach this situation? The obvious answer is to sit down, talk, and make my issues be known but before I do that, I need some good advice.<p>I also want to mention our equity is split three ways evenly with no vesting.",1400961446

You could read a dozen articles like this that explain what a tail call is in simple terms and still not know.<p>The core demographic that cares about TCO is implementers of languages like Scheme, because if you have TCO:<p>* Loops can be written as recursive functions.  In Scheme, you don&#x27;t write loops, you write functions that re-invoke themselves at the end.  This is efficient with TCO and impractical without (because the stack grows with every iteration).<p>* You can implement continuations.  Imagine if every function took an argument &quot;next&quot;, and instead of returning it called &quot;next()&quot;.

In university, I had taken the engineering &quot;Intro to C&quot; class as a first year student, but when I switched to a math major, I had to take the intro level CS classes.<p>Now, the first year CS classes are required for math, physics and chemistry majors at my school so you&#x27;d expect the syllabus to take that into account.  The class was almost entirely built around working with the Java API and object hierarchies and writing bloated Java programs to perform simple tasks. It was a huge waste of time, and I didn&#x27;t have much time to spend on a freshman level general ed requirement. I like to think my whining was one of the reasons why the math department finally made the push to offer a scientific programming course for the rest of the science departments.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to bash my school&#x27;s CS department, either.

Many current scientific methods involve heavy use of computers for things like simulation, complex calculation, or control of custom built equipment.<p>I still maintain there are many professions where coding is almost completely irrelevant.

No (for example) physical therapist does this as part of their work.<p>Many people on this board also seem to underestimate just how difficult it can be to learn to code for many people who have skills in other areas. People who are studying science are probably the type who are good at coding. If you want to see how difficult coding is for many, just look at the drop-out rates in Computer Science 1.<p>The general argument that I am responding to is that coding is comparable to literacy. I argue that both in need and applicability, it simply is not. If you are illiterate, the number one thing you can generally do to improve your life is learn to read.

7794071,comment,7793305,7794011,3,0,kimdouglasmason,,,"I&#x27;m still not convinced by those examples. My reasoning is opportunity cost.<p>If you have to learn to code to write some software, and then write it yourself, you will generally be less efficient at it than contracting someone else to do so. Furthermore, the contractor has a chance of potentially reselling the software to other clients (thus increasing efficiency even more), which you do not.<p>If it was cheaper for your father to write his own software in this case, then to me this indicates one of several things:\n1. That he had already learned to code for some other reason (possibly a hobby).\n2. That there was no opportunity cost because his business was operating way below capacity. If this is the case, his time is best spent fixing that problem first.\n3. That there is an under-developed market for software services.<p>Your fathers&#x27; example also ignores some potential problems. A novice rolling their own DB code is likely to make novice mistakes, increasing the chance of (expensive) data loss or corruption.<p>I remain unconvinced that for a busy non-software specialist (such as a physical therapist, a welder, and many other professions) writing any software more complicated than a spreadsheet formula or macro is worth the opportunity cost. That doesn&#x27;t mean that these people will never configure existing software, or write small scripts in DSLs, but I don&#x27;t consider that &#x27;knowing how to code&#x27; any more than I consider being able to remove one of my own teeth &#x27;knowing how to dentist&#x27;.",1400958419

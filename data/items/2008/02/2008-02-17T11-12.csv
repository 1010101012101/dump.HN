117537,comment,117118,117531,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> Regarding subjectivity, if you assert morality is subjective, you don't have a leg to stand on in saying I was wrong.<p>Well, subjectivity doesn't mean you're right in the objective sense. See, you opened your comment with a logical trick to prove the correctness of what you were about to say before you even said it, and you did so by deciding that there are intrinsically right and wrong moral decisions. I think that morality, specifically, happens to be an extremely subjective thing, first of all. It varies dramatically from culture to culture, society to society, era to era. Secondly, I think that was kind of an underhanded thing to do, and a friendly jest was my way of calling you on it. If I were to pull an equally underhanded trick, I might say that my reply is in fact a criticism of your thinking, and, according to your own principles, you must take it under consideration and use it to change the way you act.<p>> The point is not to dislike criticism generally, or to ignore it.<p>This part I like. It makes me really want to agree with what you're trying to say. But, then you go from that, to things like, ""...more subtle opportunities to get more criticism, that a person who loves criticism would have found."" I have a problem with that, because I think of criticism as a distraction that is sometimes an opportunity. To really love criticism is to dwell on what will ultimately be a distraction.<p>I really wish I could find my copy of Rules for Revolutionaries. (I really dig that book, and it was signed! Sometimes I loan it out ... rats.) It cited some specific examples of this, sometimes where businesses had too closely followed criticism and been hurt by that, and others where they hadn't followed it, and benefited from that.<p>So, it's not just scheduling criticism. In the book writing example, sometimes you have to know when to ignore your editor altogether.",1203249303

Graduated from Leeds last summer, and I've been scrambling round in the startup world since.<p>Anyone else from the UK, let me know. The Songkick guys held a UK hackers meetup last year, so we're probably due for another one soon. Maybe we could do one in Stratford-Upon-Avon?!",1203249262

117534,comment,117294,117519,2,0,mercurio,,,"Those numbers were just an example to say that both the gpa and school are factors. That is, an admissions committee would not do a straight comparison between gpas, but would factor in a weight for the school.<p>This is not snobbery, just the facts of life. I am not saying that a 4.0 student from an unknown school is worse than a 3.6 MIT student. There is no way to objectively know that.<p>Also gpa matters more than you seem to think. A 4.0 from MIT would do more than not hurt. It would get you admission into  a top tier program. The reason graduate programs give importance to gpa is because it takes a sustained effort over 4 years to have a great gpa when you apply. This shows an ability to work hard over a sustained period of time which is a prerequisite for success in grad school and research.<p>Finally, as I originally said, most undergrads do not have any significant research experience when they apply, and so the recommendations and gpa become more important in those cases. There is a strong correlation between recommendations and gpa, with the difference that a gpa is an objective measure. Most competent students manage to find people who will write positive recommendations for them. Its much harder to finesse your gpa this way. Admission committees are well aware of these issues.",1203248112

117531,comment,117118,117522,2,0,curi,,,"Regarding subjectivity, if you assert morality is subjective, you don't have a leg to stand on in saying I was wrong. What would that even mean? I was right, for me, or whatever.<p>Regarding ""forging ahead"": Scheduling criticism is a different issue, and one well known to writers: if you keep editing the first chapter, you'll never finish. There certainly is a place for that kind of thing. It is really a separate (and large) issue.<p>-----<p>Of course you have to use your judgment about which criticism you think is correct. The point is not to dislike criticism generally, or to ignore it. Doing those things makes it harder to find and use good criticism.<p>To use a YC example, some people have posted here asking for comments and criticism for their fledgling startup. And people have blogged about how this criticism was harsh and hard to take, but made their startup better, so they encourage others to ask for comments/criticism as well.<p>This illustrates a few different attitudes. There are some people who are too scared of criticism to ask for any. Their startups won't get the improvement that some more bold or open minded people have gotten.<p>And then of the people who did ask for criticism, many still partially dislike it, which makes it harder to fairly evaluate the criticism (finding it somewhat painful is distracting!), and their distaste makes them overlook some other, more subtle opportunities to get more criticism, that a person who loves criticism would have found.<p>So this is an important and relevant issue even at an exceptionally enlightened place. There is no magic formula to always make correct decisions, but there are ways of life which are more effective and reliable.",1203247641

117522,comment,117118,117511,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> you will be contradicting yourself, because you will have made an assertion about the objective truth of the matter<p>...unless I assert that morality is subjective. :-)<p>As for the rest of it ... well, I do disagree. I think Guy Kawasaki outlined it best in his book, ""Rules for Revolutionaries"". It has a section titled, if I remember correctly, ""Don't let bozosity get you down"".<p>A certain amount of criticism that a person will encounter will be, well, wrong. It can even be wrong when it's coming from an expert. You see this all the time in the business world. I can't tell here if you're suggesting that a person take all criticism to heart -- I think so, because of the way you talk about changing to adapt to criticism -- but, if you are, then you're suggesting that a person allow themselves to be buffeted by the winds of the popular and the trendy.<p>There's no way to always to always be correct, to always do the right thing. You might listen to a bunch of criticism, and a bunch of suggestions, and still make the wrong decision for all the right reasons. Listening to more criticism, and allowing that criticism to further change your habits, doesn't necessarily ameliorate that.<p>I counter that it's important to know when to accept criticism, and when to ignore it and forge ahead. I also posit that it's impossible to know that, so you just have to make your best guess.",1203246189

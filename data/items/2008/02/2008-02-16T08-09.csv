We just happen to be starting with Personal Finance, in general, would you buy a real book that happens to be an anthology of the top blog posts from your favorite topic?<p>And if you're a blogger, would you be willing to participate if we were putting out an anthology in your niche?<p>Lumifi looks interesting, looking into it now.",1203151759

Perhaps I'm looking at it the wrong way, but Arc feels a little light in areas (a-c).",1203151217
116893,comment,116379,116409,0,0,inovica,,,"Just wondering if you've ever used an iPhone? I'm not an Apple fan-boy, but what I am is someone that likes things that work well. I had an n95, but it sucks in comparison to the iPhone. What these numbers show is that the iPhone is EASY to browse the web in comparison to every other phone out there - the proof is in the stats. I personally use my iPhone considerably whilst out for googling or for the maps.  Try it, you'll not be so negative afterwards",1203150862

It's not about how much money you make, it's about how much ""stuff"" you can get with it. It's about what your efforts (work) will gain you.",1203150602

Perhaps a sample of the final result would help.
I generally ignore most personal finance material I come across on the web so I suspect you would have to do a very good job to get my attention.<p>However I am curious about the kind of tools and organizational system you plan to use in the production of your product.

It's also not the best option for various reasons as others have already pointed out.",1203149570

116887,comment,116768,116789,0,0,shiro,,,"I think there's very interesting thing happening around Arc.  It appears that people there are less afraid of making mistakes or repeating past attempts.  Maybe because pg broke some Lisp traditions so that others feel more free to step out of them as well.  Maybe because people with other language background are gathering so there are more divergence of minds.<p>I have my own Scheme implementation (Gauche) and I live on writing software in it, and I keep trying new ideas with it.  For that regards, I don't need Arc.  But that kind of atmosphere at arclanguage.org, that's not something I can get without Arc.<p>Maybe most of the ideas tried there will turn out not to work, but new ideas need a place like there to come out.  In a sense, Arc isn't a new programming language, but a medium that sheds a new light to the language design process.<p>And I'm watching it closely to steal whatever good ideas that come out :-)",1203148846

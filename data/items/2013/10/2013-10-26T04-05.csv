This gets worse as variation at smaller geometries increases. So over margining because no one wants another floating point bug.<p>Design effort and cost is a huge issue too. Margins at chip companies are shrinking - design automation license costs, large runtimes and much more difficult verification process from design to fab to test.<p>A new programming paradigm where there is a certain probability of error can be tolerated should go a long way in making the underlying hardware much more efficient.",1382763545

You wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need reboot privileges, you could just wait until root reboots the machine for whatever unrelated reason (e.g. kernel update). And you could do the same thing with the daemon: Wait until some updated version of the daemon is released and when root is installing it there will be a race starting when the old version exits before the new version starts and binds the port.<p>You&#x27;re also just causing trouble for yourself because then you have to worry about a bunch of arcana like whether the daemon is using SO_REUSEADDR, IPV6_V6ONLY, only binding to the IPv4 address when the machine is dual stack, etc.",1382763095

While there may be some variation by state, if we look at California law[1]: Every owner of a motor vehicle is liable and responsible for death or injury to person or property resulting from a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of the motor vehicle, in the business of the owner or otherwise, by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of the owner.<p>So if I lend you my car, and you crash it causing damage, then I am liable. Likewise, it seems to me, if I allow my self-driving car to drive home and it crashes into another car causing damage or injury, then I am liable. In general, the owners of things are liable for damages caused by those things.<p>The question of liability is not irrelevant, because insurance does not transfer liability it transfers a quantified, limited amount of risk. If I cause damage in excess of my insurance coverage, I am still liable for the damage and I&#x27;ll have to make up the difference.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d09/vc17150.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d09/vc17150.htm</a>",1382762129

5162211,comment,5161725,5161725,1,0,rotw,,,"Right. I went through the German system, and I'm not entirely sure what you mean here.<p>First off, congratulations on doing Abitur, it will open up many many career options to you. To people not acquainted with he German school system, secondary education is divided by ""quality"" into three tiers, with Abitur being the diploma you get from the highest after 8 or 9 years of Gymnasium (which the top tier is called). With that, you can attend higher education. Apprenticeships are quite common in Germany for more practical jobs, but there's an awkward overlap between apprenticeships and technical or specialised higher education institutions (which aren't actually called universities, but are basically a less academic version of the same thing. Brilliant, huh?)<p>So yeah. Doing an apprenticeship to a ""Betriebswirt"" is more akin to an apprenticeship in business studies - but it's not an MBA, as you do that at university in a subject called ""Betriebswirtschaftslehre"". Woo-hoo, go German education!<p>Anyway, I guess your your basic problem is that people are telling you to carry on the apprenticeship route and you want to go to university?Considering the tiny cost of going to higher education compared to the US... go for it. It's well worth the experience.",1359946711

The first is feasibility; the second is the relevance of our results.\nFeasibility. Neuroscientists have mapped all of C.elegans’ 300 or so neurons. However, enormous amounts of key data needed are still missing. For instance we do not have enough data on the physiology and pharmacology of C. Elegans neurons and synapses. And we still have limited data on the distribution of ion channels, receptors and other proteins on neurons, synapses and glia. Without this data we cannot build unifying models. A second problem is how easy it is to obtain the data. The crucial requirement for unifying models is the ability to access the data needed. Obtaining a deep understanding of the molecular machinery of a single neuron or a single synapse is just as difficult in C. Elegans as in human beings. And many datasets – particularly data on cognition - are actually easier to acquire in rodents, or even in humans. So we can’t just say: “let’s do this quickly in worms and do complex brains later”: we have to solve the same basic challenges, whatever brain we model. What we are actually doing is building a generic strategy we can use to reconstruct any brain.\nRelevance: Studying the “simple” nervous systems of organisms like C.elegans or drosophila, is obviously very important, particularly for molecular and genetic studies. However the organization, electrophysiology and function of the mammalian brain are quite different. One of the HBP’s most important goals is to contribute to the development of new treatments for brain disease. But pharmaceutical companies already have great difficulties in translating results from mouse to human beings; with simpler organisms these problems become much worse. If we want to make a real contribution to clinical research, it is probably unwise to invest heavily in simple systems, so distant from the human brain.",1359946661

For a long time, adoption by authors of the strict error handling it offered was stymied by lack of support in MSIE. So it's not a full counter-factual. However, we have learned two things:<p>(1) Now that MSIE does support true XML parsing of XHTML, almost no one is choosing to use it over HTML.<p>(2) Of the few experts who conditionally served either text/html or application/xhtml+xml depending on the UA, or serve XML unconditionally now, almost all have bugs in their sites which can get them to produce ill-formed XML which then shows an error page in the browser (for instance, submitting comments with certain sorts of errors).

5162179,comment,5161410,5161964,3,0,dangrossman,,,"It's neither weird nor unexpected. Reserve accounts are a decades-old tool of the credit card processing industry for approving new or unusual businesses.<p>The bank is taking a considerable risk: whatever the merchant's expected transaction volume is, the bank could be on the hook for up to 6 months worth if that business were to go bankrupt or otherwise disappear without fulfilling its obligations to customers. They would all charge back their payments, and with the merchant gone, the bank underwriting the merchant account is on the hook for all that money. If they start out at $10k a month in revenue, that's $60k in risk for the bank.<p>If a company has no track record, poor or no credit, or a business model that doesn't fit well into a known risk model, the bank can mitigate the risk that it'll lose money by establishing a reserve account. It might be a fixed reserve (i.e. $3000 for a new company with low expected initial volume), or a rolling reserve (i.e. holding back 15% of your gross sales up to some limit for an existing account that has seen a jump in its chargeback rate).<p>The alternative is to deny the application altogether. Now, a bit of speculation... Stripe, PayPal Pro and other 3rd-party processors that act like first-party processors are able to take more risks (like letting you start taking payments right away without a formal application and underwriting) because they've negotiated permission with their underwriting bank to process payments on behalf of their customers with only one or a few real merchant accounts. By pooling many customers on one account, and charging a premium on the fees, they can absorb more losses and even handle merchants with >1% chargeback rates without the underlying merchant account reaching those risk barriers, which is all Visa/MasterCard/Amex care about... as long as on average, their customers are running legitimate, healthy businesses.",1359945838

The difference is post-labor comes when you don't need human capital (or at the worst, a negligible amount) to produce the necessities for people to survive. We <i>are</i> approaching that, look at how manufacturing is returning to the US in 99% automated facilities. Once you can grow food (or fabricate it with molecular engineering) without requiring human labor to produce it, you can already distribute it with automated vehicles, and you can produce electricity via solar, hydro, or nuclear wtih very little human capital involvement after you set the system up.<p>The idea is you put systems in place that the fruits of them are effectively infinite without human engagement.

I'd say 15-20, even.<p>Ambitious or highly dedicated people will always work more than that, and that's a good thing. What they should have is a lot more freedom in how they spend that time-- working two jobs, one job and school, side projects.<p>The problem is this bullshit conformist fiction in which everyone has to pretend to be ambitious (but only internally) and dedicated (despite mediocre social status and compensation, that fail to justify such dedication). I don't think that such a problem can be legislated away. The best that the law/government can do is to break up the collusions (e.g. among VCs) that keep talent trading at such a dog-low rate against property.<p>The other problem, and one of the main reasons why the 40-60 hour anachronism lives on, is that companies aren't really buying (as they see it) 40 hours of time. They're also buying (in their entitled view of the world) single-minded loyalty. That's why they demand hours at such a level that a person can't possibly hold two jobs, even if she is easily capable of the work. The goal isn't just to get some quantity of the person's work, but to take that person off the market so no one else can hire her.",1359945213

With a lock guarding long tail or personal data, there isn't one lock to be broken just once. There are millions of locks. Sure, a cracker can get Jane Doe's data and post it to the Internet, but someone could also break into her house and steal her grandmother's old brooch. In both cases, the damage is done and can't be undone. The point is -- is there enough economic incentive to make it happen all the time? No, there isn't. The value is too diffuse to normally attract intensive hacking.<p>Instead of guarding something everyone on the Internet cares about, why not use the tech for guarding stuff only a few care about, in a context where the parties involved are largely trustworthy. There's still a need there, as evidenced by very weak physical locks used by small parties as deterrents to crimes of opportunity.<p><i>> Also, with cash, you don't hand over the entire box to someone and say ""you can only take a few dollars out and then must give us the rest back"", but that's what DRM does, to keep with pointless analogies.</i><p>You think you're being clever, but just have missed the point.

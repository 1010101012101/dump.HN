Plenty of Android apps use non-trivial amounts of C/C++ code, and Dropbox has a tool called Djinni that can automatically generate JNI glue code. My guess is that if it&#x27;s feasible to use pure Dex bytecode, then debugging is easier (because there&#x27;s only one kind of call stack), memory can be managed more effectively (because the Dalvik/ART garbage collector can manage everything), and performance isn&#x27;t impacted by the overhead of JNI. But I have nothing to back that up.",1444845594

I am taking that as being a fairly reasonable position. I just currently think it is probably at least incomplete. Now on to the actual response:<p>What would be your view of a tournament which only allows people to enter if they have a different <x> than the majority of the winners of the &quot;main&quot; tournament during the last 5 years?<p>(Example: If <x> is gender, then if 3 men had won the &quot;main tournament&quot; in the last 5 years, then only people who are not men could enter the alternate tournament, and if 3 women had won the &quot;main tournament&quot; in the last 5 years, only people who are not women could enter the alternate tournament.<p>(If there was no most common <x> then the alternate tournament would not be run, because there would not be any eligible participants. For example if one year, the two semifinalists refuse to continue.)<p>Would you say that there should also be another alternative tournament in which participants are only eligible if they have the same <x> as the majority of winners of the &quot;main tournament&quot; over the last 5 years?<p>I agree that there is not /inherently/ a problem if one gender (or other quality) is more common in an activity, and that the problems are in the causes or effects of such a situation. But I am not certain that trying to apply pressure to make the ratio closer to equal can&#x27;t be a good way to address whatever problem might be causing , or caused by, the ratio to be unequal. I&#x27;m not certain that doing that when there aren&#x27;t problems related to the inequality in outcome causes any harm.<p>If someone decides they want to give money to left handed, or to right handed, people, what harm does that cause?",1444844831

What a lot of bike activists seem to be missing is that bikes are just one part of this. Bikes are a means to an end. The goal is human friendly cities not bike friendly cities. Facilities for pedestrians are as important as facilities for cyclists. The relationship of cars to bikes is similar to the relationship of bikes to pedestrians. If you look at well designed cities they have a pedestrian focused centre, then around that a bike and car focused area. In Amsterdam you aren&#x27;t allowed to bike in shopping streets. (I&#x27;m using Amsterdam as an example because it&#x27;s known internationally, but as far as dutch cities go it&#x27;s not that good, neither for pedestrians nor for cyclists).<p>Beyond that the atmosphere is important. If you want people to spend time walking and biking around cities you need safety yes, but that&#x27;s just the start. Would you enjoy walking or biking around a city with massively wide and straight streets that go on for kilometers? I don&#x27;t think so. You need cosy streets with shops and squares with bars with terraces and trees and parks and nice architecture. The livable space of a city shouldn&#x27;t just be the <i>inside</i> of its buildings, and what&#x27;s outside is just a way of getting to those buildings. The outside should itself be a livable space.",1444844661

These color models are a trivially thin shim over RGB, and are not directly relevant to human color vision. Working with them is unintuitive and tends to lead artists to severe misconceptions. Itten’s color theory is no better: Itten was a dabbler and a mystic who ignored the known color science of his time and mostly just made stuff up without much apparent reasoning – in my opinion much less capable with color than other Bauhaus artists such as Paul Klee or Wassily Kandinsky or teachers such as Josef Albers. Albers was a great teacher because (unlike the didactic Itten) he didn’t try to impose his vision, but built his pedagogy around making students learn for themselves through direct experience doing studies with colored paper.<p>Better is to use a system more aligned with the dimensions of human color perception, such as the Munsell color system, CIELAB, or CIECAM02. If you want a Javascript implementation of the latter, I put one up at <a href=""https://github.com/jrus/chromatist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jrus/chromatist</a> a few years ago.

That&#x27;s one of the concerns that would be addressed by using directional antennas (if you&#x27;re receiving interference, rotate your antenna so that the source is in an antenna null). As far as I know, most civilian receivers wouldn&#x27;t have a directional antenna, they&#x27;d have an omni so that they work in any orientation; it&#x27;d suck if your iPhone could only receive GPS signals if it were sitting flat. On a military vessel, it&#x27;d make a lot more sense to mount an upward-cone-looking antenna high up on a mast to avoid sources of surface interference.<p>I&#x27;m super curious now though! I&#x27;ve got a software GPS receiver set up, I&#x27;d like to try injecting noise into the (virtual) signal chain and see how much noise power is necessary to lose lock. If anyone&#x27;s curious, GNSS-SDR works great with $20 RTLSDR radios: <a href=""http://gnss-sdr.org/source-code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnss-sdr.org/source-code</a><p>Edit: I did a bit more research, and it sounds like overloading the front-end is the most common approach to jamming. People are turning on multi-watt transmitters in their vehicles (e.g. to block fleet management GPS from detecting their location). Despite the amount of power they&#x27;re putting out, they seem to be limited in range to around 50 feet.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty satisfying to see <a href=""http://www.novatel.com/assets/gajt/pdf/gajt-white-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.novatel.com/assets/gajt/pdf/gajt-white-paper.pdf</a> which indicates that the solution I came up with (directional antennas with nulls pointed at the interference sources) is a solid strategy for mitigating jamming.",1444844232

R is much more regular and the documentation is better. Even complicated and obscure machine learning tasks have good support in R. <i>BUT</i> the performance for R can be very, very annoying. Assignment is slow as all hell and it can often take work to figure out how to rephrase complicated functions in a way that R can figure out how to do efficiently. I think being much more functional than Python works well for data. I mean the L in LISP stands for list! Visualizations are also easier and more intuitive in R, too, IMO. Especially since half the time you can just wrap some data in &quot;plot&quot; and R will figure our which one it should use.<p>I think the conclusion of the article is correct. R is more pleasant for mathier type stuff, while Python is the better general-purpose language. If your jobs involves showing people powerpoint presentations of the mathematical analysis you&#x27;ve done,you&#x27;d probably want to use R. If, on the other hand, you&#x27;re prototyping data-driven applications, Python would probably be better.<p>That said, I really like Julia, but can&#x27;t justify really diving into it at this point. :\",1444844000

Consider how many relatively successful life-forms cannot exist without a very specific other species of life. It is <i>also</i> a good strategy to be flexible with your dependencies - but I think nature proves it&#x27;s not required to survive and thrive.<p>Taking the long view, it&#x27;s interesting to consider the possibility (which I&#x27;m sure has already happened multiple times in tech and elsewhere) when a company has absorbed it&#x27;s dependency, and also when a dependency absorbs what was, at first, it&#x27;s host, and successfully so.<p>The one thing that throws a monkey wrench into all of this is centralized human control, and a single mind is notoriously ephemeral, changing, and emotional. The CEO of your dependency might wake up one day from a terrible dream of humiliation and failure, and decide that he can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t just exist to serve his wretched, ungrateful customers in some insignificant and petty way, and will instead take a completely different path!

But at this point maybe that says more about me than my neighbors :/<p>A general point that might apply to your situation (which I know nothing about): Speaking up can make a big difference. Human beings follow and get their ideas from the herd; if they see everyone making racists comments, they think it&#x27;s the way to do things and join in. If they don&#x27;t like it and see nobody else objecting (like you do), they assume they are alone and don&#x27;t speak up. It&#x27;s a self-reinforcing system.<p>If someone speaks up - respectfully and genuinely - then they greatly encourage others who feel the same and also they disrupt the idea that everyone shares these ideas; they show that there is an alternative. Even if the speaker gets some heat and little support at first, IME things often turn around (as long as they keep their cool). Many people just follow the herd without much thought; few are naturally hateful. At worst, the others who feel like you do won&#x27;t feel as depressed about the state of humanity.",1444843235

The project objectives were indeed rather humble, and it overall appeared to be a way of bringing the general gist of TimBL&#x27;s earlier hypertext research with ENQUIRE over the by-then established TCP/IP and DNS in the absolute quickest way possible.<p>Compare and contrast with Ted Nelson and Xanadu.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html</a>",1444842919

This is the biggest impact on ocean macrofauna, for instance.<p>3) Toxic pollution: point-source and non-point-source pollutants that depress biodiversity by either directly harming plants and animals, or by altering the local environment to make it less habitable (for example, when fertilizer runoff feeds algal blooms that reduce free oxygen in the water).",1444842442

But…<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m seeing the trends in gadgetry, software, and manufactured goods at work everywhere. The production cost (and often the price) of manufactured goods (used to be &quot;mass produced) has come down tremendously compared with average income. The trend is hundreds of years old. Underpants, sugar bowls, cereal commodities and almost everything else you can fit under a very wide umbrella of &quot;manufactured goods&quot; is heading towards free, or at least extremely cheap. We&#x27;ve seen it happen with a lot of things. Clothes pins & pencils used to be worth something, but I can&#x27;t remember cost ever being a factor. They&#x27;re basically free. Software also. I agree that a lot of things are headed towards &quot;abundance.&quot; The things that aren&#x27;t are often things that keep getting better, things where we have an appetite for (qualitative) more, iphones & whatnot.<p>The bicycles come into it at the points where there isn&#x27;t a fruitful trend towards more, better everything.

We still commute a lot, and we don&#x27;t enjoy it. It pollutes. It&#x27;s noisy. Expensive. Slow.

Their real estate leases and operations are surprisingly cheap when it comes to brick and mortar because the footprint is so small. And they have completely eliminated the most dangerous and costly aspect of B&M: inventory management. The more stores you have, the more fractured your inventory is. Every location adds incremental safety stock. Safety stock in fashion, where each color/size combo is a unique sku, tends to be at least an order of magnitude greater than the mean forecasted sales...much higher for the high end stores where an out of stock situation is a major hit to your brand image.<p>Pure e-commerce fashion companies have a huge advantage in inventory management because they aggregate their inventory in a single warehouse instead of spreading it out amongst hundreds of retail stores. But they have struggled because of concerns about fit. People tend to fall into two categories when it comes to buying clothes online: 1) Buy it anyway, try it on, and return everything that doesn&#x27;t fit, and 2) Don&#x27;t buy at all. #1 is extremely costly because reverse logistics is extremely costly (personal experience is 3-10x more expensive than equivalent forward logistics). #2 is a no-revenue situation.<p>Bonobos is doing something risky, sure...but it is novel and, in my opinion, has a lot of merit. They let people find what fits, and then they can buy as little or as much as they want, in any color, fabric, or print combination that they want online...and they have eliminated the reverse logistics and reduced inventory working capital by several orders of magnitude.<p>And sure, they can&#x27;t be everyone&#x27;s target market.

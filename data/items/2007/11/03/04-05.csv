What this means, is that a large part of the ""expertness"" comes from efficient retrieval from long term memory (a fast pipeline between RAM and HDD, if you will). Writing to HDD, in the brain at least, is usually an incremental process.<p>I am not a chess player, but in go, this makes perfect sense. You start with the most basic strategies and build on them as you advance. If the skill gap is too wide you'd probably drown in confusion trying to take apart what is going on.<p>Granted, it's not black and white. If you're smart you'd be able to take bigger jumps and piece together several steps with each jump, in which case, for you, playing somebody faaar better is simply a reasonable next step for you, but relative to your skill level it's still a ""slow"" process.",1194065738

75721,comment,75310,75408,0,0,vlad,,,"You would probably want to go for size, not just strength, so about 10 reps per set instead of 4 or 5, about 3 sets plus a warmup set, and about 3-5 exercises per body area, and repeat about once a week.  So, about four times per week.  You really want to take about 45 to 55 minutes, unless you do cardio for 20 minutes beforehand to build up cardiovascular strength as well, in which case you would spend about 1:30 at a gym, four times per week.  That's all it takes.  Tomorrow, I'll try to find some links.<p>But the main thing is to eat a lot of protein, drink plenty of water (to flush your kidneys), eat many meals throughout the day, and get lots of sleep.  That's what's harder to do than going to the gym.",1194064432

Hard-wiring of reciprocal altruism in the form of emotions like guilt and gratitude is one of the main reasons humans can form these large and mostly stable social structures.<p>EvPsych basically makes one important observation and asks the natural question leading from it: Just like our eyes and hands, our minds have also been developed in response to evolutionary pressures. What were these pressures and how do they account for the features we see in ourselves, like language, love, laughter, crying, etc?",1194064324

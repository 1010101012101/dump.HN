3170571,comment,3169678,3170442,10,0,kenjackson,,,"Actually the problem is deeper than this.  You can't have type safety w/o memory safety, and it has nothing to do with casting.<p>Here's an example.  You allocate a chunk of memory as type Foo.  You use it as Foo.  You hand out references to Foo.  Everyone is happy.  Then someone says, ""We don't need this instance of Foo anymore"" and deletes it.  Someone later comes and allocates Bar and the memory allocator correctly goes and grabs some of Foo's old memory and uses it for Bar.<p>All good, right?  Well, except there's this other thread that is using a reference to that old instance of Foo.  Suddenly you have a type safety issue at hand.<p>Now you can say, ""Don't write programs with bugs"".  And indeed that is just about the only alternative.",1319846210

Devices were generally jailbroken quickly and easily, but it's been getting harder. The iPad 2 <i>still</i> doesn't have a usable jailbreak despite having been available for half a year now. iOS 5 only has a tethered jailbreak (i.e. you must connect it to a computer when rebooting the device) and even that is only on certain devices, even though betas have been available since the summer. In fact, even iOS 4.3.4 and 4.3.5 don't have untethered jailbreaks.<p>To me, it looks like Apple is actively locking down the platform in a big way and trying pretty hard to shut down jailbreaking entirely.

Here is the transcript of the relevant parts:<p>""The problem with innovation in the TV industry is the go-to-market strategy. The TV industry has a subsidized model that gives everyone a set-top box for free, or for $10 per month That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation, because nobodys willing to buy a set top box. Ask TiVo, ask Roku, ask usask Google in a few months. The only way thats ever going to change is if you can really go back to square one, tear up the set top box, redesign it from scratch with a consistent UI across all these different functions, and get it to consumers in a way that theyre willing to pay for it. And right now theres no way to do that.<p>The TV is going to lose until theres a better  until theres a viable  go to market strategy. Otherwise youre just making another Tivo. Its not a problem with technology, not a problem with vision, its a fundamental go to market problem. And then it not like theres a GSM standard where you build a phone for the US and it also works in all these other countries. No, every single country has different standards, different government approvals, its veryTower of Bableish. No, balkanized. Im sure smarter people than us will figure this out, but thats why we say Apple TV a hobby; thats why we use that phrase.""<p>For video see the section on, ""On Apple TV and why television is balkanized:""<p><a href=""http://www.geek.com/articles/apple/what-you-need-to-know-about-steve-jobs-talk-at-d8-2010062/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geek.com/articles/apple/what-you-need-to-know-abo...</a><p>I've blogged about this subject before as well, but I'll include my thoughts here as well:<p>""Content producers like TV studios and stations control the entire TV industry because they control the content. Theyve created this market where customers pay for the content (subsidized by commercials) and get the hardware for free. But by getting the hardware for free, theyve stifled any innovation and advancement downstream from content production.<p>Only through the magic of open-source software has innovation happened. XBMC is an amazing piece of software and is getting easier and easier to use very day. At the same time, downloading TV is now easier than ever and still getting easier. Its only a matter of time before someone makes the 'Napster for TV shows.'

It runs DFU for its boot process, they have examples for various compile system IAR/Keil etc but no explicit gcc support.<p>Looks similar to the NetDuino space although frankly I'd love to see a microSD card slot for holding stuff rather than simply relying on the on-chip flash.<p>I'd love to understand the lowest cost HDMI compatible frame buffer interface one could put on these. I've got an idea/application that I started prototyping on a Chumby which would benefit from their price point.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp</a>",1319843227

That's a substantial thing to give up, IMO."""""" <- This is true only if you have poorly abstracted type casts. If you design your C++ program correctly, you simply won't ever be type casting or manually handling any of your memory. In fact, with a well designed system, this also solves your issue regarding centralized memory planning. I mean, it is as if you are assuming that once you touch C++ you are going to have a million little calls to malloc() with casts all over the place (which shouldn't even be true in a well-designed C program).",1319843042

The Gimp is absolutely horrible in that regard and completely ignores what the absolute majority of professional graphic designers are used to.<p>Font handling under X in general is pretty weak.<p>Color management has to work.<p>Vector Grafx<p>Inkscape is pretty good.  But in some ways not good enough.  It crashes to often with heavier files.  But ok.  I  actually use it but would like to have Freehand back, UI again.  Inkscape would be nice as native Mac App, yes, for UI reasons.  UI is pretty important because it drives workflow, speed, productivity.<p>Quark 3\nWas a classic.  Everything about it was done right.  Again, main thing the UI.  Font inspector.  Main window resizing.  How to create new pages, how to link Texts.  It was dam fast, with hundreds of pages open and links to database full of graphics.

I don't have anything against Adobe, I haven't ever spent a dime on their software, so who am I to complain, however:<p>Just about the only reason I need to reboot my Mac is whenever I watch flash video (southparkstudios.com) and forget to close it before I shut the lid down. When laptop wakes up, it's frozen and I can't kill the browser.<p>Buggy flash from Adobe is probably #1 reason stopping adoption of Linux right now. Not only it's slow, has numerous issues with sound, but it also crashes regularly and generally looks and feels completely fucked up: wrong font rendering, steals focus and mouse clicks form the browser, etc. Ughh..<p>Photoshop is the only Mac program I've seen that uses ""setup"" and ""uninstall"" paradigm, two idiocies from the Windows world.<p>And finally, their ridiculous Flash implementation burns my lap, I'm not kidding - whenever I visit a heavily flash-infected site, my MBP gets burning hot even for small video inserts on ESPN. BTW it also greatly reduces my battery time. Adobe software is probably the only reason why surfing the web on a 5 year old PC is a very unpleasant experience.<p>They are one of these old, big fat monopolies the world would be better without, but we have no choice.<p>Suggesting switching to GIMP isn't an argument.

485976,comment,485701,485701,0,0,physcab,,,"One aspect of ""selling"" that is often under-reported is the importance of making good presentations. I am constantly astounded at how bad some people are at conveying their ideas.  Even a brilliant mind can seem stupid if they do not master the way in which they convey that information.<p>Here are a couple tips:<p>- Stick with pictures.  If you put up a paragraph on a slide, then I have to choose between listening to you or reading what you wrote. Sometimes I get confused and end up thinking about my next lunch break.<p>- Tell a story. Don't jump into specifics and don't generalize. Make sure your content is a happy medium between the two and it flows in a way that makes sense to the average person.<p>- PRACTICE!!!! Oh god how I can't stress this enough. There must be a linear relationship between how many ""Um's"" and ""oh's"" and ""ah's"" in a presentation and how long you spend practicing.<p>- Improvise to social queues.  This is difficult to master, but when you give a presentation you have to be observant about what is happening in the room. Do people look bored? Try to relate the content to them.  Do people look tired? Keep them informed how much longer you will be presenting.  Are people squinting? Emphasize the concept and not the detail.<p>Bottom line:  If you can master the presentation, your chances of making a deal go up dramatically.<p>Who are good presenters?

This would affect some other features as well, for example filtering the project list. But it would allow people to find new projects more efficiently.<p>Also add a field for 'time to finish' once the project is done.<p>Allow sorting or filtering projects by est. time. If I don't have more than 4 hours, I don't want to see any projects that take longer. Additionally, in the 'New Here' section: <i>Clusterify: work on fun, small (~2hr) projects and meet other coders.</i> '2hr projects' is not very relevant - a lot of projects listed are est. time >2 hours, and it really depends on the quality/quantity of people who join.<p>Do you want to explicitly specify a limit on the number of people who join?

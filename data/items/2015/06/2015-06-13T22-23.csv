9712909,comment,9712267,9712489,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"For me (Delphi programmer until around 2001), there were several more important factors in the eventual failure of Delphi.<p>First, at the time Borland (or, briefly, Inprise) tried to move into the &quot;enterprise&quot; market, with expensive, nebulously defined &quot;middleware&quot; products like Midas. This is why they aggressively pursued failed tech like CORBA. It was a disaster, and had nothing to offer those who wanted to get stuff done. They also clung to BDE despite the fact that ODBC was much more mature and fast. Serious users used some ODBC components that someone built.<p>They forgot that Delphi was a tool to build great apps in, and didn&#x27;t figure out that Delphi was great on the back end. It was all about GUI apps, but it turns out that it was incredibly productive for non-visual apps, too. With a better strategy, Delphi might have competed with Java, but they missed a lot of what made Java great in the beginning. Support for web development, even sockets, was near-non-existent.<p>One problem with backend apps in Delphi was that it was painful to work with C libraries. One huge thing they could have done was to make it trivial to generate C bindings, but the best they had was a rather terrible tool to convert header files to Pascal files. (I wrote a much better tool that understood macros and could even translate complex C++ headers like Microsoft&#x27;s MAPI, but I&#x27;m sure Borland could have done even better.)<p>Delphi also tried to pursue COM (in addition to CORBA) as a distributed programming glue. Delphi 4 even had a typelib editor (which was buggy and horrible), which you needed to use to get any performance at all; the automagic &quot;OLE Automation&quot; support built into the language was awesome but really slow. It turns out that distributed programming with COM was not very mature, and trying to use it with Delphi was painful (though possible).<p>Borland also got distracted by Linux (not a good fit for a closed-source company) and by C++ (C++Builder could never be as successful as Delphi since they didn&#x27;t control the language and had to extend the C++ compiler with custom directives to make it work the way Delphi did).<p>In the end, it&#x27;s best summarized as: Lost focus, didn&#x27;t realize what they had, pursued the wrong markets. Being stuck with a proprietary language didn&#x27;t help, of course.",1434233784

That&#x27;s exactly what REPEAT is in Logo, and kids handle that just fine.  So maybe clojure-turtle can be used to smooth out the learning curve in Clojure curricula?<p>2. My talk at Clojure/West was about programming in Clojure in other languages, which could open up accessibility to programming to non-English speakers (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqjMZNwnYCY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqjMZNwnYCY</a>).  I think translating clojure-turtle shortens the first step to reaching a new human language -- the set of constructs you need to translate is much smaller and more tangible.  If Logo works for kids, it should work for anyone.  For those who have seen my talk, clojure-turtle is sort of my successor to clj-thamil (programming in other languages) in the sense that they can make programming and/or Clojure more accessible to much wider audiences.<p>3. Logo is used to teach kids programming, and it&#x27;s fun!  MIT&#x27;s Scratch is based on Logo -- it&#x27;s a visual version of it.  UC-Berkeley uses a modified version of it for its intro CS 10 class, and code.org uses a version of it in its projects to teach kids programming.  So we&#x27;re teaching Lisp (Logo) to beginners because it&#x27;s simple (and easy), but why is it that when they get older, Lisp/Clojure is all of a sudden hard and &quot;weird&quot;-looking?  That ought to be a short gap to bridge, right?<p>4. clojure-turtle uses Quil because the ClojureBridge curriculum uses it for capstone / advanced concept material.  But Quil is a great choice on its own merit.  Since Quil shares a codebase between Clojure & ClojureScript code, it easily compiles to Java and JS, meaning we ought to be able to make a try-X.com website out of this, too.<p>Let me know if you have any other feedback, thoughts, etc. about the code or anything else.",1434233435

I have no idea what Apple would do if this became common, though.

In fact I remember coding Delphi in an evaluation copy of the IDE given away on a cover CD from .Net magazine (not to be confused with Microsoft .NET). And then a few years later downloading a pirated copy of a beta release of Visual Studio .NET.<p>It was actually the web that introduced me to Borland&#x27;s Windows IDEs. I&#x27;d used Turbo Pascal extensively, but then got hooked on Visual Studio once I migrated away from DOS. Then I started seeing talk of these Borland development environments for Windows and thought &quot;<i>I love TP, so why not give these a shot</i>&quot;. I actually much preferred those IDE&#x27;s to Visual Studio as well, but alas my career and personal interest was switching to non-Windows technologies at that point and thus I never really found a practical use for Borland&#x27;s Windows compilers.<p>A few years back I did need to throw together a basic Windows app for some clients, but by that point Delphi was dead and I&#x27;d forgotten a lot of Pascal&#x27;s nuances anyway. So I ended up knocking up something in VB.NET; which was actually less painful than I remembered from the .NET 1.0 days. In fact almost pleasurable. But for all of Pascal / Delphi&#x27;s warts, I did very much prefer that language over any of the iterations of Visual Basic.

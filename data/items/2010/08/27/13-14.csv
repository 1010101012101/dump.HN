It works that way really well, except on the outside chance that you're trying to search for a URL, or something, but I think we can agree that's an edge case.<p>I agree that you need tabs, but I thought that the IE9 preview was pretty clever in floating the tabs next to the address bar, meaning it takes up one less panel than before.<p>Do you need a title line?  Really?<p>Do you need a status line?  I think the default behavior in Chrome is that the 'status' line floats onto the screen when there's something to show, otherwise there isn't one.  I agree that you need a favorites bar, but I disagree that it won't ever change.<p>As for your second paragraph, let's just say that I disagree with it both in premise and in practice.  Chrome's UI completely obliterates the points you suggest in the first paragraph, and again, I think the assertion that it won't ever change is as wrong as the (faulty) assertion that it hasn't ever changed, because clearly it has.",1282917591

As I was reading this morning I wondered how the largest video rental company (BY FAR) allowed a newcomer to become a serious threat to their business in a matter of 3-5 years, and force them into bankruptcy in about 10 years.<p>My conclusion after a bit of thought is that as the big player in the game, the incumbent has an incentive to be complacent.  In the case of blockbuster, doing business as usual seemed to be a pretty good option.  The owner (W. Huizenga) was a multi-billionaire and blockbuster was bringing in large profits every year.  Complacency was pretty profitable.  For Netflix howeverr, complacency would have meant non-existence.<p>On the global scale, I now see many countries that are as hungry as Netflix was in the late 90's.  The generation before them grew up dirt poor and this history is never far away from their minds.  They are now training their current generation to adopt the best from the U.S. and reject the worse.  But they ARE changing..rapidly. They're diversifying their economies to build a base of manufacturing for the working man, and research for the intellectuals. In the U.S., the working man is going broke, and the intellectually gifted are often going to finance (take a look at Harvard/MIT recruiting over the past 10 yrs).<p>Software development is the one area where I can say the US is on very solid footing relative to it's peers, but is that enough?<p>It's somewhat cliche to say that China is a rising power, but I wonder if the rise of countries, particularly China, India, Brazil will mean a radically different future for the U.S. There is large segment of the U.S that are nostalgic to a past perceived American glory and yearns for even more complacency than we see today , and I fear what will happen if they get it.",1282917367

I made the mistake of saying I had a girlfriend in London that I was seeing as part of the trip - after that I got extensive questioning.

Took a while to get used to, but now I keep my mouse in my desk drawer and only pull it out if someone borrows my computer.<p>First it starts with the setup. At work I have an external monitor and keyboard. I keep my MBP to the right so I can use the touch pad here and there when I can't use the keyboard for certain things.<p>Here are some tips/programs/plugins I use:<p>1) Vim (not macvim) and screen - This dynamic duo is the greatest invention. I recommend it to anyone who has the time to learn. Once you do, you'll never go back.<p>2) Vimperator - Firefox plugin - This one has changed my browsing experience for the better. Once you learn all the commands you'll be flying through pages.<p>3) Remap your CAPSLOCK key to ESC - Once you start using vim and vimperator, the esc key becomes more useful. I remapped my CASPLOCK key to ESC so its quicker to reach. I used the program called PCKeyboardHack.<p>4) Learn your keyboard shortcuts.<p>6) Try to replace programs you use often with console versions. For example I dont use any gui programs to access databases. Diffs/text search/file searches are all done through command line.<p>7) Spotlight - I don't use Dock, sometimes I forget its even there. I would disable it if I could.<p>8) pbcopy - command line program that you can use to copy to your gui clipboard. Try piping contents of a file to it. Becomes very handy.<p>Most of my day I spend using Vimperator and Terminal. So it's easier for me to not have to use a mouse.",1282914436

7711237,comment,7710733,7710953,6,0,mikeash,,,"The Space Shuttle was a political football whose design was dictated by the whims of Congress and the meddling of the military first, and by engineering second.<p>The Shuttle was required to be reusable as a political goal. However, it was not given the funding it needed to actually accomplish it in any reasonable fashion.<p>The Air Force put some tough requirements on it, such as the requirement for enough cross-range capability when landing to be able to launch into a polar orbit from Vandenberg, deploy a satellite, and land back one orbit later. This is purely a wartime requirement. No peacetime mission needs this. This required much bigger wings (and thus much more weight), even though the Shuttle never once launched out of Vandenberg, let alone on one of these crazy single-orbit missions.<p>Politics screwed up other stuff too. The solid rocket boosters, for example, were manufactured on the other side of the country, largely because of Congressional pork. The long and difficult transport process required the boosters to be built segmented, and that design directly lead to the loss oF Challenger.<p>Similarly, budget constraints dictated the cheaper SRB-plus-external-tank design rather than a more sophisticated and more reusable (and more expensive) reusable booster. This design directly lead to the loss of Columbia.<p>The net result was that the Shuttle had a very narrow engineering margin. The SSMEs are engineering marvels in terms of how light they are and how much power they put out. But putting out a lot of power for little weight is a really bad plan for something you want to reuse. Reusability means robustness, and robustness means extra weight and less power.<p>The Shuttle is what you get when you say, &quot;How much will it cost for a reusable launch system? $10 billion? Too much, we&#x27;ll give you $5 billion.&quot; (Numbers in the ballpark but mostly made up for illustration.)<p>On the other hand, the Falcon 9R is what you get when a for-profit space launch company wants to make more money. It&#x27;s not a prestige project, it&#x27;s not a political project, it&#x27;s not a military project dictated by thoughts of all-out war with the USSR, it&#x27;s not subject to Presidential grandstanding or Congressional pork. It&#x27;s just a bunch of smart people thinking of ways to save their customers money and turn a better profit while doing it.<p>The Shuttle was an extremely ambitious design that did everything differently. Ultimately, everything was too ambitious to be reusable.<p>Falcon 9R, on the other hand, is deeply <i>un</i>ambitious. The rocket is a pretty standard design. They don&#x27;t even try to use liquid hydrogen for any stage, even though it&#x27;s theoretically more efficient, instead favoring easier-to-handle kerosene. Their rocket engines are high performance but not on the bleeding edge. And when they decided to go for reusability, instead of building a whole new system with wings and ceramic tiles and all sorts of other extreme innovations, they just said, let&#x27;s slap some legs on the first stage and give it some extra fuel. It&#x27;s a completely different approach that pretty much only shares the word &quot;reusable&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Shuttle really has many lessons to offer when evaluating the potential of Falcon 9R.",1399481503

You get technical debt / bitrot instead.<p>If they keep component X too long, they&#x27;ll need to reimplement / rebuild X from scratch in a few years when the original factory/production line doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. This would require a lot of up-front cost that may be higher than just producing a new element of that type for every launch.<p>I don&#x27;t think the message was completely negative though: &quot;depending on the level of reusability&quot; sounds more like &quot;this is hard, but if you pull it off with cost of restarting production << cost of reusability over N years, that&#x27;s an achievement&quot;<p>Edit: many words",1399481487

Given your comment about &quot;I didn&#x27;t need a tuturial for Subversion&quot;, though, maybe you&#x27;ll find that inadequate, too.  As someone who tried using SVN before ever touching hg or git or its forebears, I found SVN baffling.  To me, the DVCSes make sense.  HgInit&#x27;s &quot;Subversion Re-education&quot; page says:<p>> Mercurial separates the act of committing new code from the act of inflicting it on everybody else.<p>The fact that this isn&#x27;t the case in SVN is mystifying to me.<p>I still struggle with git.  In fact, I don&#x27;t use it, largely because I still don&#x27;t know <i>how</i> to use it.  Note how I said that &quot;the DVCSes make sense&quot;.

Because,<p>a) it&#x27;s better (read: nicer to use), and\nb) when you use Mercurial, it comes with the benefit that you&#x27;re helping inoculate the dev world against a DVCS monoculture.<p>If it helps, know this: I write as someone whose use case is largely the one you outline.  I mostly find myself working alone, on a side project of mine where I&#x27;m the only committer.<p><pre><code>  # Crystallize your changes in a revision marked with your\n  # commit comment:\n  hg commit\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s it, pretty much.  Occasionally you&#x27;ll need to do an hg addremove to make sure Mercurial isn&#x27;t ignoring any new files you&#x27;ve introduced (hg add and hg remove if you want to do things manually), and an hg mv whenever you need to move things around.<p>Everything ramps up pretty sensibly and steadily from there, so that you&#x27;re really only spending the mindspace to pay for the features you&#x27;re really using.<p>For example, if you have a public-facing repo:<p><pre><code>  hg push # read as &quot;publish&quot;, if it helps.\n</code></pre>\nDo this, occasionally preceded by an hg out (when you find that you want to see <i>what</i> you&#x27;ll be pushing), and you&#x27;re good to go.",1399481483

That means you spare no expense making sure your payload is absolutely perfect. High costs of launch breed high costs for payload design and manufacture, which means you need to guarantee a high chance of getting your precious payload to orbit, which means you want a pristine rocket to carry it for the best chance of a successful launch. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle, driving up quality requirements and costs at every point in the cycle.<p>SpaceX is intending to break that cycle. If launch costs are low, then you can afford to put cheap payloads into orbit. If the payload fails, just launch another one. If the best chance of a successful launch matters a lot to you, pay a premium to launch on a virgin booster.<p>However re-usability of the first stage is only going to get them so far. If half the total cost of a launch (pure guess) is in the booster hardware, and they get just 10 launches out of each one, then the total cost per launch will be cut to close to half of what it is now. That&#x27;s great, amazing even, but it&#x27;s not 10x cheaper and certainly not 100x. To get down even close to 10x cheaper they need to recover the second stage as well.",1399481178

I&#x27;d hardly characterize it as a &quot;robust e-commerce operation.&quot;<p>The real competitor, at least on the web, is McMaster-Carr. Their product selection is vast; their prices are usually better than Grainger; their delivery is incredibly speedy, with orders typically arriving the next day, even with standard shipping.

7711127,comment,7710673,7710673,1,0,lifeofanalysis,,,"Let me answer the question you asked, and, then the question that you did not ask.<p>The fastest and dependably assured way to make a million dollars to build a product/service that is profitable and sell it. If you can project annual profits of more than $100K, you can sell it for a million dollars. Want concrete examples:<p>- There is this guy who provides &quot;Text Messaging&quot; service to his B2B customers. So, he will go to your local gas station, ask them to sign up their customers&#x27; telephone numbers, then sends texts to their signed up customers with their coupon special on non-busy times like &quot;20% off on oil change on wednesday before lunch&quot;. These coupons get pretty good response. If you use Twilio, it costs $1 to send 100 coupons. So he charges them $30/Month to send out 4 texts to 100 customers. Net profit: $26/month per customer. Spend this year, and, go around within your 30 mile radius, sign up a bunch of businesses and get rich.<p>- This guy built a profitable business in a very unsexy category: maidsinblack.com. He writes about it on Reddit sometimes. Check it out.<p>- A guy places, seriously, mylar balloons at flower shops, hospital shops, etc. And takes a cut of the sales. Makes $60K a year.<p>Ok. So now the question that you did not ask: to college or not to college.<p>I know there is an opinion floating around that in this age of easily accessible self learning, you can skip college. Here is the thing though: to be a successful business owner/manager, you have to make a lot of decisions. And that means a lot of analysis, data etc. Intuition/gut-check helps; but analysis is the foundation that can not be taken away. So working backwards from this, to do/understand analysis, you have to be pretty good at unsexy things like Math, Logical Reasoning, Model Building. Now, you can learn all that on your own. But will you have the self-discipline to do it on your own -- or will the structure/rigor of a college (even evening courses at a community college) be a better way?<p>Sometimes when you look around, you think people like Bezos just sit in meetings and make decisions while someone else does the analysis and presents them with alternatives. That could not be further from the truth; to make good decisions, 1-2 big ones and 10-20 small ones every day, you have to be able to quickly understand the &quot;insides&quot; of an analysis -- and for that you can not avoid at least the foundations of an numbers based education. And, don&#x27;t forget, there was a time not too long ago (1995?) when Bezos went around looking for money for his start-up; he did all that analysis/projections all by himself. It doesn&#x27;t hurt your persuasion skills if you are good with numbers and can counter with <i>numbers</i> when they have objections.",1399480609

BitTorrent, for instance, led to the development of uTP (micro transport protocol). One of its nicest features for torrent users is that it will slow itself down now in response to congestion and play nice with other network-using processes on the client side.<p>Putting this into the underlying connection like ATM did just means that you at least have to pick a default QoS and hopefully applications/systems pick a sensible assignment for the traffic.

You just need to know enough to know which questions to ask and then surround yourself with advisors who can help answer them.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever built a new product (doesn&#x27;t literally need to be a commercial product) from scratch and actually gotten people to use it, then you&#x27;re probably already capable of thinking strategically - that&#x27;s the first core ingredient for dealing with the market / product / economic challenges tasked to CEOs.<p>The second ingredient is the empathy and people-management part... This means being able to internalize concepts like e every employee is different, values different things, and therefore might need / expect different things from you - some employees might deeply care about working on interesting projects; others might care about being able to work in a specific time / location so they can maximize the time they spend with their family; some might care about money; but in my experience overwhelmingly most employees just care about feeling like their work is meaningful and appreciated.<p>Learning how to build an organization out of people who all have different personal priorities, levels of experience, backgrounds, and personalities is not trivial. You basically need to develop a high degree of self-awareness about your own needs and values as an employee first. And once you&#x27;re able to do that, it gets a lot easier to recognize and understand what others need.<p>TL;DR; - there&#x27;s a big menagerie of different things you have to learn to be a CEO, and engineering can help you structure the process of learning them but it&#x27;s not enough unto itself.

In the sense that it&#x27;s easily possible to design websites to display text and writings without needing js. So from a practical standpoint, I think js is mostly unnecessary. There are obviously services which wouldn&#x27;t be possible without js (e.g., openstreetmaps), and I do un-block js for those sites.<p>You are of course correct that js is not the only way users can be tracked, however it is one of major components in tracking.<p>Looking at the EFF&#x27;s panopticlick [0], with js blocked:\n> Within our dataset of several million visitors, only one in 57,814 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours. Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys 15.82 bits of identifying information.<p>With js enabled:\n> Your browser fingerprint appears to be unique among the 4,104,774 tested so far. Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys at least 21.97 bits of identifying information.<p>So even something as simple as disabling javascript turns my online fingerprint from being unique to being one of 5% of users who have used that site. So while disabling js doesn&#x27;t make one immune to tracking, it does make it more diffuclt.<p>In summary, for most of my use of the web, js is unnecessary and does more harm (tracking) than good (it&#x27;s not needed for consuming text). I enable it on a case-by-case basis for some websites, if it&#x27;s needed. But unless the js is truly critical to the presentation of the information, I won&#x27;t enable it and I&#x27;ll likely leave the site. Because, yes, much of the web is broken without js; but that&#x27;s frequently due to (in my opinion) poor site design which doesn&#x27;t fail gracefully in the absense of (usually unnecessary) js.",1399479326

Git is different from classical version control system, which makes it hard to learn (e.g., why first commit and then push?) But when you get the hang of it most of it actually makes sense and you start to become more productive with git then you have ever been before. The trick is not to stop learning before you get about 80% of what&#x27;s out there in your head.<p>People who spend less then 5 hours a week coding probably don&#x27;t need git and I think it&#x27;s stupid that people replace SVN everywhere with git. Git&#x27;s power is the power user and the shell. I can only suggest to use GUI tools in that case. They don&#x27;t allow you to do anything but its harder to break things as well. The problem here is not git though. At least not in my mind. The problem is that many people who don&#x27;t know git very well try to apply it to use cases which are not git&#x27;s strength.<p>In any case your concerns are valid.

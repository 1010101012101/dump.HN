B is cheaper, but has no advertising. Which one wins? A because nobody knows that B even exists.<p>However, everybody is worse off. Consumers got advertising displayed to them that they didn't want to see <i>and</i> they got to pay more for the privilege. The manufacturer of B lost totally.

What is the purpose of the electric car? The low/no emissions or the high MPG? If you ask people you will find out that almost all of them will say the MPG since that is the reason that has a monetary impact.<p>I recall when I was in England I had a Renault Clio Diesel with 1.5 liter engine. That car would give me 66 mpg on the highway and around 50-55 mpg in the city. That was back in 2003 and it cost brand new 9,000 GBP (less than $15,000). That car was small, comfortable and fun to drive. It did what it was supposed to and more.<p>Why do we see then a $41,000 price tag on a vehicle that cannot give us 66 mpg and that will be subsidized by the government (i.e. we will all pay for every car sold whether we like it or not).<p>Great!",1280505426

IATA, ICAO, ISO, all competing and separate, all with insane and bat-shit psychotic rules and conventions (eg, IATA lets multiple airlines have the same ""two letter designator"" [by the way, it's sometimes three, but you never know for sure] if they operate on different parts of the globe and 'rarely if ever will confuse an operator'). When the hell did computers need human-understandable designation short-hand codes for things? What the hell was wrong with 1 - American Airlines, 2 - Air Canada, 3 - Delta, 4 - SAS, 5 - That small one that flys between A and B once a year you've never heard of. Why the HELL do we have a system that has ""AA"" and ""AA*"" ? This is basically the worst thing you can do for normalization of global data. Travel GDSs are even worse, they don't actually follow along with these standards because they cannot, so while you take your ""AA"" flight number 123456 (oh, by the way, we recycle flight numbers instead of archive forever historical tickets) from airport zzz to xxx (by the way, depending on the standard they came from, your airport might not even exist), which are actually city codes for airports, so when you're flying to a city with multiple airports you have two cities in the GDS just to deal with this.<p>We can't even agree on how to measure distance, it's like we're stuck in the stone ages. What the hell is wrong with measuring in kelvin degrees? Why do we have MORE THAN FIVE separate standards for systems of measurme for what most people think is one (the metric system)?<p>Fact: We do not live in 1950 or any time before then, computers don't give a flying rats ass if the letters make sense to you as a short-hand abbreviation, you should just number them. That's what databases are for, to relate data. Major airports alone have several names people call them anyway, some airlines go by a few names (for example, SAS airlines is actually ""Scandinavian Airlines"").<p>Fact: We do not need to encode data about the data into the primary key of our data. For example, we do not need to generate employee numbers like ""Q100-5-TR-9"" where Q is the building they work in, 100 is their pay grade, TR is their last name's first two letters, 9 is that number we introduced for separating all duplicates of Q100-5-TR. This is just stupid, stop this insanity NOW.<p>People working on global standards, you should be ashamed. Do you have ANY idea how much time is wasted because we do not have UUIDs for so many things, even something as simple as an airport? There's only 50,000~ of them, and we have duplicates? Did we run out of beads on the abacus??",1280505125

In fact, when the iPhone was first released, all the pundits and bloggers were practically screaming that it was so unfair that Apple didn't allow developers to write native apps and that HTML web apps were a poor substitute for what you could do natively. They pointed to how Google got to write a custom app for maps, and how it was unfair to competitors who would be locked out.<p>It was like that for the entire first year of the iPhone. Then, once the app store was announced, it's like all the bloggers and pundits suffered coordinated, selective amnesia. The irritating thing about this article is that the tone suggests this is somehow something Apple would be upset about, when in fact, Apple promotes HTML apps as an alternative to the restrictions of the app store.<p>The success of the App Store is 80% linked to the fact that it's a frictionless purchasing environment. I can buy an app from some random person for 99 cents and not have to worry that he/she has my credit card number. Furthermore, you're likely to think twice as you go to purchase a 99 cent fart joke app and you're entering your credit card number into a web form. That feels like you're spending money. But punching your password into iTunes <i>rarely</i> (if ever) feels like spending money. Apple is excellent at separating consumers from their money. Developers of App Store apps get to use ""the hand of Jobs"" to ply your cash from your wallet.<p>I suspect that if Apple allowed web apps to bill against itunes accounts, you'd see a huge explosion of pay iPhone-optimized web apps that would otherwise go into the App Store. With a little bit of Safari integration, you could allow developers to put little ""buy now"" buttons on their web apps and it would feel just like an app store purchase. I doubt Apple would ever roll out such a feature, since it sounds like it would be minimal benefit but have a fair number of headaches.",1280504155

This I think is the source of all problems in the friction between open source philosophies and the general populace. At his heart, RMS is an economic theorist, not a social or technological one. This is because software takes time to make, and time = money. Yet he continuously fails to understand this because he's never personally had to feed himself with the fruit of his daily labors. In RMS's mind, making money from your effort = mistreating people.<p>The analogies between RMS and various communist thinkers all derive from the simple fact that none of them ever had to feed themselves in that way and simply don't understand how basic economics work and all come up with various economic ideals that simply aren't modeled on how the world works.<p>By his model, all people have to do is write software, give away all their labor for free to be ""ethical"" and then feed themselves off of reward payouts and speaking engagement fees (or some other mysterious source of money RMS has left unspecified because he simply doesn't know how people actually make money in the real world). This is clearly a model that doesn't scale beyond maybe a few dozen people on the planet. The rest of us need to eat, arguing that we are bad people because we demand our supper after a day of work is what makes RMS's arguments ultimately unethical. He would rather people starve to death than charge for software -- this is ultimately what his equation balances out to.<p>If I ignore this type of prattling nonsense, I have to say that RMS <i>has</i> been on the balance a force for good in the world. But he's fantastically out of touch and seems perfectly oblivious to it.<p>Now, if he changed his message and said ""it's a good and useful thing, it's 'nice' for people to release free software, and we all can benefit from sharing and pooling our labor together"" I don't think anybody would have a problem with him.

These professors slaved away in hopes for a number of things:  time off, freedom to research, being able to work with bright young students, etc.  They weren't the only ones who had dreams or who slaved away.  What about the grad student who drops out, wants to switch to a different field(a side effect of the system is overspecialization), who chooses the wrong advisor or institution?  What about the bright, but poor, undergraduate who would like to have a self-study option and a small fee for tests?  (Yes there is that option for some lower-level courses but is curiously absent for higher-level courses.  Similarly, universities within the same state often don't accept transfer credits from each other except for a few courses.)<p>If people should be paid for their hard work, then a lot of people are underpaid.  People though are paid for their productivity.  These professors and grad students who slave away are not productive.  They are not producing what our society needs.

Instead of doing one or the other well, both provide excuses for mediocrity.  At middle and bottom tier schools effective teaching is possible but faculty use their research as a justification for high salaries.  The students learn the material outside of class mostly.  There's very little in-class discussion and the only justification teachers have for their salaries is their ""research"".  A good teacher, as far as the students are concerned, is one who gives fair and/or lenient tests and isn't a boring lecturer.  The teaching part of their jobs could be replaced by a textbook, some video lectures, perhaps an online homework system, and tests at a testing center.  Such a system would make a good business model if the current system wasn't so deeply rooted in our society.

1561362,comment,1560835,1560835,0,0,ccc3,,,"This article is bullshit.<p>His main line of argument is the same criticism that's consistently leveled at Tesla: that it's too expensive to be a big seller. This is obvious. Batteries are still in their early days as the primary energy source in cars. Early technology is expensive (The original macintosh cost $5000, inflation adjusted). The obvious point of the Volt program was to develop technology and infrastructure for the future, not just to produce the first generation Volt. It's certainly fair to debate GM's efficiency in building electric vehicle capabilities, but the author of this article doesn't ever seriously acknowledge that GM has ambitions beyond just the first generation Volt.<p>A few smaller arguments I have:<p><i>For starters, G.M.’s vision turned into a car that costs $41,000 before relevant tax breaks </i><p>Bob Lutz said that the Volt would cost around $40,000 when he was on letterman a year ago, so the price shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who follows the industry. But as I already argued, we're in the early days of electric vehicles. Just like in the early days of personal computers, these cars will be bought by enthusiasts. As we've seen with every other new technology in history, price will come down over time.<p><i>And instead of the sleek coupe of 2007, it looks suspiciously similar to a Toyota Prius</i><p>It's a little difficult to take an automotive pundit seriously when he complains about a production model not looking like the concept. Frustrating as it may be, production models almost never look like the concept. This is nothing new. And the reason it looks like a Prius is physics. It turns out that there is an optimal shape for reducing aerodynamic drag, so cars that are built with fuel efficiency as a primary design goal will all be roughly the same shape. This also should not be a surprise to anyone who follows the auto industry.<p><i>It also requires premium gasoline</i><p>So what. It shouldn't use much of it anyway. For most owners this will not contribute significantly to the cost of running the vehicle.<p><i>seats only four people(the battery runs down the center of the car, preventing a rear bench)</i><p>I'm guessing most of the target market won't care about this.  This is also the type of compromise that has to be made in early technology.<p><i>has less head and leg room than the $17,000 Chevrolet Cruze</i><p>So does a Lamborghini. People buying a Volt are not likely to be considering how much interior volume they get per dollar.<p><i>No wonder the Volt’s main competition, the Nissan Leaf, forgoes the additional combustion engine — and ends up costing $8,000 less as a result.</i><p>It also forgoes the ability to go on a road trip. Best case the leaf will have to recharge for 30 min every 80 miles. GM was trying to build something that could fully replace gas-only vehicles, Nissan wasn't.<p><i>So the future of General Motors (and the $50 billion taxpayer investment in it) now depends on a vehicle that costs $41,000 but offers the performance and interior space of a $15,000 economy car</i><p>The author should be embarrassed of making this statement. GM is a massive company who's business units range from car parts to medium-duty commercial trucks. The Volt is just one, albeit highly visible, program.<p><i>Yet G.M. seemingly has no plan for turning its low-volume “eco-flagship” into a mass-market icon like the Prius</i><p>A quote from Bob Lutz:<p>""The Volt technology is very exciting, but costs will have to come down before it can become generalized, and U.S. fuel prices will have to rise to world levels, meaning $5 or $6 per gallon,""<p>That seems to suggest that the plan is to develop the technology until prices can be brought down and fuel prices go up (a bit of a gamble, but it seems likely that fuel costs will increase eventually).<p><i>and some significant portion of the $14 billion loan G.M. got in 2008 for “retooling” its plants</i><p>By putting the word retooling in quotes he seems to be suggesting that GM wasn't retooling their plants. If that's his argument, he should state it directly and give a source.<p>There's no shortage of legitimate reasons to criticize GM, but calling the Volt a failure before it's even been released is nothing but pointless speculation.",1280503048

I can tell you from experience (although mine predates the explosion of the WWW) that more than half of the people in MBA programs are robots. Having said that, isn't that true for any other degree? In the end, it's not the degree that matters, but the person.<p>Funny thing is that when I did my MBA, the professors were saying that MBAs in Canada (where I'm from) were nothing like the US. MBA's in Canada were taught to be middle managers, while MBAs in the US were taught to be more entrepreneurial (there's no ""American dream"" in Canada). When you read about the US tech gurus mocking MBAs you get the impression that's clearly not the case.<p>I don't think it's necessarily fair to judge people by the degree, but on the person as a whole - personality, geek level, work experience, etc.",1280502691

I see it all the time in my program - students take everything they learn verbatim and act like it is gospel.  In reality, they should always be questioning what they are learning, thinking about how it might apply in the real world, and what the benefits/consequences are.   For example, my Entrepreneurship class is making us write a business plan with the sole intention of gaining funding.  That's nice - but at the same time I'm using it as an exercise to also see what the plan would look like as a lifestyle or small (37signals-ish) business.<p>Secondly, MBA programs are just now beginning to (somewhat) teach that pure profit maximization is not the only goal of a business.  It will take a while for this to catch on, and not all MBA students are going to adopt this way of thinking, but there are some of us out there who do.  This is happening with both social ventures and sustainability-focused businesses.",1280502573

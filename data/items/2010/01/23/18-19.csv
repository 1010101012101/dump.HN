1072210,comment,1071558,1071874,0,0,elblanco,,,"Apparently HN is refusing to let me reply to you. So I'm doing it here.<p>The point of saying X.org/Linux is that I could form some ridiculous argument that would require a completely different naming convention. Why don't we call all cars Benz/Cars since Karl Benz holds much of the work that makes cars go? Or all helicopters Da Vinci/Helicopters? Because it's silliness.<p>Calling something GNU/Linux is silly nonsense RMS designed so he could get his beard stroked. If you notice he's never suggested the following:<p>-Linux (powered by GNU)<p>-Linux-GNU<p>-Linux/GNU<p>-Linux - With GNU utilities<p>-Linux - powered by GNU and Xfree86/X.org and the Mozilla foundation.<p>-Linux/GNU/Xfree86|X.org/Mozilla<p>- etc.<p>He's suggested only GNU/Linux. Notice GNU is in front (to remind us all how wonderful GNU is) and the '/' indicates it's interchangeable. Like ""do you want ham and/or cheese on your sandwich?"". Only GNU != Linux, the two are not interchangeable. The GNU Hurd is a failure. But I bet I could cobble together a GNU free Linux distro for the most part today, even rewriting most of the utilities in a couple weeks, and probably completely in a couple of years once LLVM gets up and going.<p>He wanted to co-opt the relative success that Linux became by formulating an argument such that the only resolution in his mind was to call it GNU/Linux. And instead of building his own system, he built a bunch of the crap for a completed system, then spent the rest of his years dwelling in Emacs and emailing himself wget harvests of websites because for ""personal reasons"".<p>Really, outside of maybe the compiler toolchain (which is looking to have a short lifespan in the face of LLVM and associated front ends like Clang, are any of the utilities that hard to replicate? (quick answer no, I had to build most of the GNU toolkit from scratch for a single OS course assignment in my undergrad, including a shell, everybody had to do that, it's pretty easy). I'm sorry, but a few dozen utilities like 'ls' and 'cat' don't allow somebody to co-opt somebody else's hard work.",1264272419

1072205,comment,1069818,1069818,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"It's another form of privatizing privilege and socializing cost.  A corporation is granted privileges of personhood, but spared the liabilities.  A corporation can't be imprisoned, and it's very difficult and expensive to criminally prosecute its executives (its brain?) and impossible to do the same to its shareholders (its body).  (It's also difficult to seek civil remedies; if you are not of comparable size, they can often effectively spend you into the ground or, financially, keep you from even starting.)<p>There's a reason we lock people away, other than to prevent them repeating a crime:  It's a form of punishment and control that -- for most -- exceeds financial penalties.  Corporations are, as an entity, immune from this.  And the bulk of the people who enable their activities are, as well.<p>In light of this, I see no problem with a reasoned limitation of their privileges.  They do not exist as living beings (I initially used the word ""corporeal"", but I imagine that would confuse some or my intended meaning be deliberately mis-interpreted in counter-argument); they are not granted the same privileges.<p>(For those who don't make the connection:  The ""socialization"" of cost means the costs incurred when corporations engage in criminal behavior.  This might be be seen to include the prevalence of such behavior, as a result of a lack of effective controls against it.)",1264272218

1072197,comment,1071434,1071821,0,0,ashley,,,"You're right to say that Citizen United does not change how we view campaign finance as protected speech for humans.  I definitely was wrong and unclear on that point, but I respectfully disagree about the implications of the Citizens United ruling: my point is that this ruling sets the stage for allowing undue power to corporations, both non-profit and for-profit.  Corporations are not living beings with unalienable rights, so we should not have worried that limiting their speech would have implications for us human beings.  For Scalia being such a conservative reader of the law, he certainly took a highly judicial activist position in this ruling.<p>excerpted from the article: In vivid contrast, the majority overruled a 19-year-old precedent (Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce) that had lambasted the corporation, when it entered the political arena, because of ”the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s suport for the corporation’s political ideas.”<p>The problem with treating corporations as if they have a ""right"" to free speech and freedom of association is that they have a disproportionate amount of influence arising from their sheer size and aggregated wealth.  We have other mechanisms to ensure that size and wealth do not override the voices of the small and poor in elections (look at how the Senate is constructed versus the House or how we have the electoral college to ensure that wealthier coastal states do not decide presidential elections).<p>And also, the fact that we grant any rights to corporations at all arises from a court stenographer's foot-note that later opened up loopholes for clever (although might I add shortsighted) lawyers in subsequent cases that eventually snowballed into granting rights to this nebulous entity.  As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent to the Citizens United ruling, ""A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.  Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it.”  And yet, we worried that limiting the financial power of corporations will potentially infringe upon OUR (human) 1st Amendment rights.  That is the problem for me.  We created the corporate entity like a machine to serve our purposes; it does not exist with unalienable rights as we human beings do.<p>Who donates the most to campaigns, 501(3)(c) non-profits and charities or Fortune 1000 corporations whose explicit purpose is to generate profits for stakeholders?",1264271725

This skimmer in particular seems like something they'd develop for a portable experience but I can't tell for what device.<p>All that is a roundabout way of saying in my mind there are two parts to the new business of news - what gets produced and how it's delivered.

But your email suffered from mixed messages.<p>In 1999 here in Toronto there was a huge snowstorm. We received 1.2 m of snow that month. We ran out of places to store the stuff (e.g., once it's ploughed in a city you can only pile it so high, it must be trucked elsewhere at some point). Everyone was beginning to get pissed at the city government for how it was handling a situation which, remember, was out of its control. All they could do was react.

They are collectively using 2000 pieces of heavy equipment including ploughs, ice melters, salters, and front-end loaders. That said, Toronto has 5600 km of roads and 7945 km of sidewalks. We cannot clear all roads and sidewalks instantaneously and it will take some time. We believe we can clear the highways and main arterial roads in the next 24 hours. If needed, military personnel in Bison vehicles will respond to 911 calls in order to transport victims to the hospital. It will take several more days to clear side streets and we will need your help. You will be notified when your street will be ploughed. Please remove parked cars so that we can accomplish this task more easily. You will not be ticketed for parking elsewhere during this time. If you do not move your car, it may be towed to an adjacent street at no charge.""<p>The mood seemed to change after that. The statement single-handedly accomplished the following things. It:<p>-clarified the scope and magnitude of the problem we were facing in a manner that everyone could understand<p>-reassured people that the government was on top of things by <i>providing specific facts</i><p>-set manageable expectations<p>A statement like the following would have been way better received I think (I'm making up some facts of course):<p>""Wakemate launched 75 days ago as a 2 person startup. We began pre-orders 50 days ago to incredible demand. In fact, we have received over 5000 pre-orders which is above and beyond our wildest dreams for initial demand. We are currently working 7 days a week around the clock in order to get you your Wakemate as quickly as possible. But we are sorry to inform you that we will not be able to meet our original deadline of January 25th. Instead, we anticipate that we will be able to fulfill our pre-orders over the course of the next 90 days. So that we may more effectively address the orders, we need to know what device you will be using the Wakemate with and who your service provider is (link to survey). This information will allow us to prioritize shipment and provide you with more specific shipping dates. You will receive another email by February 15th detailing such information. Should you have any questions or concerns about your pre-order, please email us at...""

Stacy McCain as a starting point (CJ claims he's racist), and you'll find plenty of others.<p>Or are you questioning my ""as the jihadist threat receded""?  In that case, I mean that it's receded in the  minds of Americans due to a lack of successful attacks in the West or on Westerners (e.g. Bali).  India, for example, has a rather different interpretation on that, and of course we in the US have seen at least three serious attacks in 2009, two successful (at that Arkansas recruiting center, Ft. Hood and of course the Knicker Bomber).",1264270441

Status as a patron saint, on the other hand, is bestowed by popular acclamation and use among the laity: if enough people involved with the Internet ask St. Isidore for intercession regarding it, then he is the patron saint of the Internet, but it could just as easily be St. Patrick (or the two of them simultaneously, for that matter).<p>(St. Patrick is popularly held to be the patron of a few dozen things of things, including -- totally not making this up -- engineers, expatriates, and the Irish, so I hit the trifecta there.)",1264270188

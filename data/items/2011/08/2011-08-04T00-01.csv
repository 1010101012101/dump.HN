Seriously, it is <i>awesome</i>.<p>But, being realistic, an incredible amount of value is currently being created by software <i>engineering</i>.  Value to society, and (hence) value to those who can practice the craft.  I'm not surprised that so many schools are teaching software engineering, instead of computer science.",1312419549

2844024,comment,2840062,2844016,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part II<p>Sadly, last year I did have at least three infections, my first ever.  All three were from Web browser usage.  I don't know the sources of the first two, but the third infection was from one use of the Akamai download manager software to get a PDF file from an Asus Web site.  As I since discovered, that Akamai program is a common source of viruses:  There are some obscure parameters in the program with some bugs, and passing the right string from an HTML page to the program can infect a computer.  So, again, the problem was that the Web browser and the Akamai software permitted software from an untrusted source to execute.<p>My solution:<p>(1) Except for a few, essential, explicitly trusted Web sites, do Web browsing only in Windows User mode and not Windows Administrator mode.<p>(2) Severely restrict what Web browsers can do.  For each browser, spend hours or a few days going over each browser security option in detail and block everything at all questionable until have a browser that barely works on common Web sites.  When on some Web sites the security options are too severe, f'get about the sites.  For the options, document each click.  Of course, must block Java and Active-X as if they were bytes of Anthrax.<p>(3) Disable all Web browser plug-ins except Flash.  Due to the security threats of Flash, restrict Web browsing only to 'mainstream' Web sites and hope and pray.<p>In particular, never even entertain enabling anything like the Akamai download manager.  If want a PDF file from Asus, then try to get one sent as an e-mail attachment instead of via a browser plug-in.  For now and into the future, regard essentially all browser plug-ins as never to be used.  Period.<p>(4) For PDF files, let Adobe Acrobat read only files from relatively trusted sources.  Disable the ability of a Web browser to call Adobe Acrobat automatically.  That is, do not let any PDF reading software be an enabled browser plug-in.<p>(5) After any software changes, review again what browser plug-ins are enabled and again disable all but Flash (many software installations install and enable browser plug-ins without permission or notification).  Swat back all those plug-ins like infected insects.<p>(6) Once a month download and run the latest Microsoft Malicious Software Removal tool (MRT).<p>(7) Keep a copy of the boot partition when all the software on it was freshly installed and still virus free, and be able to restore that copy of the partition given any symptom of a virus.  With some effort, some careful usage of options, 'decoding' some really obscure Microsoft documentation, some experiments, some guessing, some detective work, and a few days of work, maybe two weeks full time, this saving and restoring are possible via the standard Windows program NTBACKUP.<p>(8) Of course, block all automatic software updates and downloads, and minimize all software updates.  When the system is working, essentially FREEZE it -- if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<p>(9) Try hard to block any automatic execution of any software on removable media.  Here, Microsoft tries really, really, really hard to keep people from blocking such automatic execution.  Microsoft really, really, REALLY wants such automatic execution and wants to sweep under the rug the outrageously obvious security threats.  So, have to be very careful about what removable media insert into a Windows system.<p>(10) Have Windows Firewall enabled with severe restrictions.<p>(11) Be very careful about any software source where permit its software to execute.  This means, permit third party software to execute only from essentially impeccable sources, e.g., with signed software, etc.  This also means, for nearly all third party software, f'get about it.<p>So far these steps have worked.<p>For infections as in the article, that is, via e-mail, I am not concerned.  In particular, for some progress on PC computer security, pay attention to my 11 steps above.  Also pay close attention to the first rule of computer security.  For the article and its ""unwittingly"" via e-mail and downloads, f'get about those.  I'm passing out stuff that is from good up to great; the article is passing out nonsense.<p>You wrote:<p>""It is a fact that there are very competent people behind these attacks.""<p>That statement is true but a 'non sequitur' in this discussion and, thus, off the subject.<p>The issue from the article is getting infected ""unwittingly"" via an attachment via e-mail, and, with anything like a decent e-mail program used in anything like a decent way, that's nonsense even for ""very competent people"".<p>In particular, the article is pointing people in the wrong direction:  The problems were not from e-mail or downloading but, presumably, that is, taking the minimum from the article, from 'opening' a spreadsheet file.  That distinction is key, crucial.  There's nothing ""unwittingly"" about it.  The problem was that word you claimed was there but was not -- OPEN.<p>""The whole scenario seemed quite plausible to me, without my having to assume that RSA employs a bunch of idiots.""<p>It's not ""plausible"" to me:  The problem had to be ""open"" and not e-mail or downloading.  And ""unwittingly"" had no role.  Again, once again, still again, over again, once more, the first rule of computer security is:<p><pre><code>     Never, ever permit data from an untrusted\n     source to execute as software.\n</code></pre>\nThe problem in the article was a violation of this rule.<p>Just what is it about this rule you are having such a really difficult time understanding?  Why are you so determined to believe in ""unwittingly"" instead of rationality?<p>This rule is really good news; why are you being so determined to keep struggling in the 31 F waters instead of reaching for the lifeboat and warm, dry blankets of this rule?<p>""As for your gripe about the quality of the article, think about the target audience.""<p>I am:  The audience needs to f'get about the article and ""unwittingly"" and pay close and careful attention to the first rule of computer security.  For that rule, did I mention:<p><pre><code>     Never, ever permit data from an untrusted\n     source to execute as software.\n</code></pre>\n""That said, I thought it was a pretty decent article.  It explained in relatively easy to understand terms how the attack worked and the possible rationale behind it.""<p>No:  That is definitely what the article, deliberately and/or incompetently, did NOT do.  The article claimed that ""how the attack worked"" was via its ""unwittingly"" and downloading, which are nonsense.  Again, once again, to repeat yet again, still again, the problem was OPEN and, in particular, violation of:<p><pre><code>     Never, ever permit data from an untrusted\n     source to execute as software.\n</code></pre>\nThat's enough.  If I continue to respond to your writing from not having read what I wrote, I will be just repeating the same, simple, on target points over a dozen times.",1312419521

2844022,comment,2843533,2843533,3,0,lsc,,,"Ram prices recently fell dramatically. (the really dramatic drop is that 8GiB modules are now priced reasonably;  it used to be you'd pay 2x or more per gigabyte for higher-density modules, and now the price per gigabyte drops slightly as density increases, I mean, until you get to the 16GiB modules, which are still ridiculous.)  This change has triggered a surge in ram density in newer servers.<p>It looks like VMware is trying pretty hard to capture most of the surplus value created by the cheaper ram.<p>I mean, it's been long said that VMware will look at how much money you can save by virtualizing and consolidating your old hardware, then they try to charge just enough less than that number to make the project still worth doing;  In the past, I think, this has been seen as more reasonable, as vmware is helping to create some of that value.<p>Moving to grab some of the surplus value created by cheap high-density ram, something VMware has nothing to do with,  I think, has been seen as unjustified and greedy in the SysAdmin world;   it remains to be seen if still charging by the gigabyte of ram but just charging less will be accepted.",1312419500

2844016,comment,2840062,2842881,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part I<p>Please seriously entertain my claim that the article is not to inform computer users about how to avoid 'malware' but, instead, is just a case of a standard practice in journalism to distort a real situation to create uninformed fears to grab people by the gut to get their eyeballs for the ads.<p>In particular, the article is very far from reality about computer security.<p>Next, you are just not reading; instead, you wrote:<p>""You are sorely mistaken.  First, the article clearly states that the user downloaded and opened the file.  It was not some automatic process put into motion by the mere fact that someone emailed him, as you suggest in your rant.""<p>Totally, flatly, clearly, absolutely wrong.  Your ""and opened the file"" is just wrong.  The article never said any such thing.  I just went through the whole article and looked at every case of the string 'open', and at no point did the article mention that the file was open or opened.  And in the first paragraph with the start of the story, nothing like 'opened' was described or even implied.<p>Instead, the situation in the article was just as I quoted in the key statement from the first paragraph of the article:<p>""The man clicked on the message, downloaded the attached Excel spreadsheet file, and unwittingly set in motion a chain of events allowing hackers to raid the computer networks of his employer, RSA.""<p>There is nothing here about 'open' in any sense.<p>Indeed, if this sentence were correct, then with any decent e-mail software his computer would have been quite safe.<p>Of course, ""downloaded the attached Excel spreadsheet file"" has to be wrong:  The e-mail message would have already been received, in total, with the ""attached"" file so that the file did not need to be ""downloaded"".  Of course, if the file was ""downloaded"" from just a URL in the e-mail message, then the file was not ""attached"" to the e-mail message.  So, either the spreadsheet file was attached or downloaded but not both.<p>With irony, your:<p>""It was not some automatic process put into motion by the mere fact that someone emailed him, as you suggest in your rant.""<p>gets at the main bad point in the article:  The author is interested in drama, just drama, to grab readers by the gut, and in the special case of drama as some threat from some inexplicable, unfathomable, hidden evil forces of darkness.  In particular the article did NOT include your ""opened"" the file and, instead, just had its:<p>""unwittingly set in motion a chain of events allowing hackers to raid ...""<p>So the threat was not from your ""opened"" but from its ""unwittingly"", that is, synonymous with my ""inexplicable, unfathomable, hidden"" and, with irony, also with your ""some automatic process ..."". The author IS claiming that the 'infection' was from some ""automatic process"" which, of course, is nonsense.<p>Again, the main claim early in the article is that any computer user is vulnerable to a massively destructive infection and security breach MERELY, ""unwittingly"", from an ""automatic process"", of receiving a bad e-mail and then downloading an attachment.  This claim is nonsense, total 100% fuming, flaming, reeking nonsense.  It's wrong, and from an effort to create confusion to scare people.<p>For your<p>""Second, I suggest you take a moment to reconsider your position that 'a virus, a root-kit, a Trojan, malicious, malevolent, nasty, etc., but STILL is just 100% harmless, safe, and innocuous' unless the computer is being operated by an idiot.""<p>No, my statement is correct, a nice contribution, and fully appropriate for the subject of computer security for users of e-mail and personal computers.<p>To repeat, the key point for the target audience is not some ""unwittingly"" but just what I wrote:<p><pre><code>     Never, ever permit data from an untrusted\n     source to execute as software.\n</code></pre>\nThat's the key rule that everyone using a personal computer today needs to commit to memory, tattoo on the back of their right hand if necessary, pray to God each day at bedtime if necessary, and follow in all computer usage without exception.<p>The rule is simple and plenty within the ability of nearly any computer user.<p>And the rule insists that computer users know the difference between data just sitting in a file and data permitted to execute as software; this difference is just crucial.<p>Of course, the article, out of convenient ignorance or deliberate confusion or both, wanted to avoid mentioning your ""opened"", to avoid saying that the problem was not receiving the e-mail with an attachment, was not downloading a spreadsheet file, but WAS 'opening', and thus executing as software, data from an untrusted source.<p>The poor computer user was fine, safe, secure, etc. up to the moment they 'opened' the file.  Again, the problem was 'opening' the file and not just receiving or downloading, unwittingly or not, the file.<p>""That is, unless you have never, on any occasion, been a victim of malware yourself.""<p>The usual approach of the losing side of an argument is to attack the other person, not the other ideas.  So, you are now after me, personally.  I'm not the subject here; the article and computer security are the subject.<p>I've never gotten an infected computer via e-mail.  With any decent e-mail software used in any decent way, it's essentially impossible for anyone to get an infected computer via e-mail.  Again, as I explained, all standard SMTP and POP 3 e-mail is is just some lines of text of 8 bit bytes.  This data is super simple to handle safely.  To get an infection from such data, have to work at it.  I made this point clear; it's good news; apparently you missed it.",1312419422

Phrases such as ""predatory pricing"" exemplifies a fundamental misunderstanding of how pricing works, or markets in general.<p>People forget the whole point of the market is to serve the consumer. The point of the market is not to protect the interests of old tech giants because they can't compete with free. They're willing to prevent consumers from enjoying the satisfaction that Android has to offer because they want money for doing what Google offers for free. By this logic I should start a search engine that charges $10 a search, then sue google for anti-competitive practice.<p>Everything about business is predatory. Every time a company releases a better product it is predatory to their competition. Offering an edge your competitors can't handle is kind of the point.

It is not a position that varies based upon the actors.<p>The pro-Apple lobby, however, has a position that essentially holds Apple's patents as legitimate and righteous to enforce, but everyone else's as illegitimate for various reasons. It is farce to criticize lodsys and others for entirely legal IP protections -- as the system supposedly encourages -- while supporting Apple and their like behaviors. Whether a company is open to counter-attacks is irrelevant to the legitimacy of patents.<p>Virtually everyone who interacts with HN relies upon Linux (for instance as the foundation of their startup). Linux infrgines on countless Microsoft patents.

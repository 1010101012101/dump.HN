Ugly code can stay ugly and I sleep fine at night.<p>But whenever I wade into the code for good reason, I reward myself by refactoring whatever areas I happen to touch.  It's like throwing a fish to a seal.  That way I always get a chance to do fun things like unifying similar code or making code more data-driven.<p>I'm still a perfectionist, but I'm also a strategic procrastinator.  So while I'm working on code, whenever I think of <i>anything</i>, however small, that might improve it, I'll throw in a comment such as ""TODO 0703 might want to tighten this up"" or ""TODO 0703 you need to test this case before releasing"".  I am so relentless and unforgiving that sometimes the TODOs multiply like rabbits.<p>Before I release anything, I grep on ""TODO"".  As long as any TODOs show up, I can't release.  If I need to put off something until later, I'll change that ""TODO"" to ""LATER"".  Occasionally I'll make a point of revisiting my LATER entries, converting some of them back to TODO.

When the crowd goes one way, I look to see what the other way looks like.<p>I find articles like this -- where the underlying premise seems to be ""people are stupid, science is not"" to be deeply flawed. People use the word ""science"" to cover all sorts of things. In this example, it was used to cover the results of a study. Guys? Studies are inherently non-conclusive -- for lots of reasons, including the correlation and causation problem. I can show you studies that will show correlations between about any two things you would like. What's the old saying? ""If you torture the data enough, you can get it to confess to anything"". The stats on medical studies, in particular, are very concerning. The proper response to being presented with <i>any</i> study is to say something like ""That's interesting. What other pieces of data do we have?""<p>It's not to change your world-view. If your world-view is so flimsy that you'll change it on a dime, you're not exactly being a critical consumer of information.<p>Secondly <i>scientists are people too, just like the ones studied.</i>. Everybody seems to overlook this fact. We all have these wonderful gems of how people act irrationally, self-reinforce in groups, are slow to change opinions, etc., and nobody asks ""wonder how all of that affects the study of science?""<p>Why? Because the purpose of such self-congratulatory bullshit like this is to tell ourselves ""I am a creature of reason and science. These other people are primitive non-thinking dweebs""<p>It's all just so much intellectual self-stimulation.<p>I'm all for studies in human irrationality to continue. This is a very interesting and fruitful area of research. But the picking it apart and trying to make social or political observations out of it? Not so much.",1278163363

But what we can do is exercise a measure of intelligence and free will to anticipate the relationship between stimulus and response, and alter our environment accordingly.<p>I.e. if you're trying to lose weight, don't allow yourself to be exposed to fast food advertising.<p>Our brains may be heavily influenced by our environment in ways that we are not normally aware, but the existence of studies like these shows that we can begin to understand the dynamic of influence. Once we have understanding we can take appropriate measures.<p>As I see it, that's the true power of intelligence and human agency.<p>After all, as you point out, animals also have certain powers of inhibition.

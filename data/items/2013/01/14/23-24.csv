I thought your point was that flexible control flow structures like if-else allow you to change code quickly and more easily in the future.  Wasn't that the point?<p>Assuming I have understood your preference for flexible code, I am simply stating my belief that it is useful to balance this with rigid code.  Sometimes the flexible code is simpler, easier to read and write, and more maintainable, sometimes the rigid code is simpler, easier to read and write, and more maintainable.  It depends on what you are trying to do.  In this particular case I prefer the ?:.<p>The assembly argument was based on a notion I had that any time you use something more complicated than test and branch for control flow you are introducing rigidity into your code.  Often this lets you be productive too; switch statements are a good example.<p>And lastly, let's assume I am 14 years old.

For example, consider that we have our application, and it uses the ""foo"" library (which provides a ""bar"") method, but it might also use the ""baz"" library (which provides an optimized ""bar"") if baz is installed.<p>Currently, you have to attempt to load baz before you load foo, and then not load foo's implementation of bar, if baz loaded successfully. In the future, you could just prepend foo, and so if baz was already loaded, it doesn't overwrite its optimized implementation. If baz wasn't loaded, then when it does load, it would overwrite the prepended implementation properly.<p>This just frees you up from having to worry so much about load order.

""Fuzzy"" always helps prosecutors (unless the defense can argue that it's so fuzzy it's unconstitutional, which is pretty hard), because the prosecutor gets to choose who goes to court in criminal cases of first impression. They find someone with insufficient resources to mount a vigorous defense who happens to be wildly unsympathetic and the judge and the jury will make the contortions necessary to put them in prison -- and then that precedent sets the stage for the next prosecution.<p>Make the law clear and some defendant will get off on a technicality, but only once, then you fix the loophole. Over time the law evolves to more accurately reflect congressional intent as they pass patches to fix bugs, instead of leaving it to the courts and the biases (like prosecutors choosing who to prosecute when they want a precedent) that come along with that.",1358207383

It makes it very artificial and staged somehow.</i><p>Agree. What if they were actually private conversations, but with the same model of inviting people in?<p>I thought of Branch recently when I was reading the intro of Shirky's ""A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy""[1]. He mentions that before the internet, technology only enabled two-way, one-to-one communication (telephone, telegraph) and one-way, one-to-many communication (newspapers, radio, TV). The pattern of many-to-many, starting with BBSes in the 70s and becoming fully ubiquitous only now with Facebook, is new.<p>It got me thinking about how the many-to-many communication models online don't match those we have offline. When you have many-to-many communication offline, you sit down at a table with a small group of friends, family, or colleagues. Everyone at the table can listen and speak. People can leave, or new people can be invited to join. And the group is an ad-hoc one, formed <i>for</i> the conversation, which doesn't persist after the conversation is over.<p>There's no form of online conversation that has these characteristics  no remotely mainstream one, anyway. And Branch is interesting to me because it's sort of trying to tackle that, except by allowing everyone in the world to read the conversations (or ""listen""), they turned it into something completely different.<p>I don't think many-to-many communication online is a solved problem. We may still see new, better models that will displace the current ones.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>",1358206603

He should be remembered as a well-meaning, curious dreamer, someone who later in his short life wanted to organize others politically for the public good. An unusually sensitive everyman. He's being portrayed instead as a technical genius or some other kind of elite. He always sought to be involved in technology, but he never really accomplished anything technological; he did not invent RSS or even work on what people think of when they hear RSS. (His involvement was with a minor offshoot of the real 'RSS.') He contributed almost nothing to Reddit. He wrote a few minor open-source libraries, like thousands of others. I do not mean any of that as a criticism; obviously most people don't achieve much new technologically. The key here isn't ""genius"" but ""public-spirited."" Not ""analytical power"" but ""playfulness."" Not Gandalf but Frodo.<p>Of course, his death is a horrible tragedy. It is even moreso a horrible tragedy if it actually resulted from the JSTOR incident, rather than from personal pressures he felt or from mental illness. The JSTOR stunt accomplished nothing. It would barely have helped anyone. It was purely symbolic. That is one reason the prosecution of him was so misguided, but it is also seemingly leading to a majorly misguided reaction by people who really have no idea what they're talking about.<p>This caricature of him after his death feels grotesque and manipulative. Lessig and others should be ashamed of themselves.

There is a small charge to publish events (there are few features that justifies the price) but it's completely free to use. It' s relatively new so there is nothing much I can tout about revenue. It's getting decent traction but what I've learnt is that the Islamic world is something really hard to reach out to for these online, tech stuff; many of the organizers don't get it.

I think it behooves programmers to really think about the interfaces their code offers; don't just expose something through setters and getters because it's there, ask yourself, what is this class really offering that you couldn't get with a struct?

Just consider this: most games ""think"" of the bits of art that are in them as ""art assets"". And in many cases the music, the textures, the voiceovers; you could replace those with something entirely different, or at least something generic, and the game mechanics would still work exactly the same.<p>I mean, we are talking about games here - well, I am, the article kinda isn't - not about ""stories"". Yes, games are accompanied by stories, they used to have title screens and now have backdrops for the options menu, they had cover art and now have thumbnails in the steam store, etc., there is an intro, an outro, and while you play you also are exposed to lots of little artsy pieces.<p>Does singing while driving your car turn car driving into art? In the same way I argue adding art to games doesn't automatically make them art, either.  Which doesn't mean you couldn't theoretically make art with your car, and sing while you do it. But if you're just commuting, that ain't art (unless it's the opening sequence of Office Space :P). And that's on the level of creativity most AAA games are made.<p>Looking at the gameplay, they are more or less the same. What little art is in them they borrowed from movies, which still do that part so much better I really wish games could go back to actually being games, instead of just bad kitsch. Then we could find out what we still don't know; if a <i>game</i> - the mechanics, not how those mechanics are dressed up - can be art. We're still at the stage were anything that makes you feel something, <i>anything</i>, gets wildly applauded, which seems kinda of sad. Instead of being honest and just saying ""hey, this one is not pure shit, which is a welcome change to the usual"", people get super emotional and attached. To me that's just Stockholm Syndrome. I'm sure on this planet there is also a person who has the facebook ""like"" thumbs up tattooed on their body, because it means so much to them. Would it make that symbol art? Not for me. That would just make that person a really sad one in my eyes.<p>Again, definitions vary, but I also wouldn't call anything that obsesses about statistics, sales, and how to addict people to your product even more as ""art"". As in, the exact same product I might consider art or not art depending on why and how it was produced. I'm not even sure I'd allow anything produced while wearing a tie <i>period</i>. Artists are rare, they're kinda the original hackers if you think about it.. and just like everybody and their dog considers themselves a hacker, so it is with art. That's fine, but so is being a jaded critic.<p>Yes, violence can be used to tell a story about courage. But when it comes to games, and even many movies, the stories about ""courage""* are actually just a pretext for violence.... duh! I doesn't take Albert Einstein to notice that, either, so it's really hard for me to assume ignorance instead of malice here. That crap hiding behind what precious few of truly great things humanity created, just bah!<p>* I put that in quotes because it doesn't take courage to be shot at by 20000 people and not get hit once, even if the actor pants and acts all tense.. same goes for most games, where loosing, or not getting a hint what to click within 5 seconds of starting, might loose potential customers and therefore gets cut from the game, where every slightest challenge is after a checkpoint, unless it's a roguelike or bullet hell shooter. Courage, pah. That's just dreaming. Every game has a wiki dedicated to them and in general, most gaming is about trying to avoid challenge while getting to see the art assets.<p>People are min/maxing because that's the best you can do with this stuff. They don't play games to grow as persons or see life from different angles; who the fuck does the article author think they're kidding? Games are played to kill time. I think it was Thoreau who said ""as if you could kill time without injuring eternity"". I wasted a lot of time on games in my life, but I will not waste even more by standing idly while such hideous crap as the article linked here is spouted... I can at least take all that wasted time and turn it into venom. I'm a former hardcore gamer warning casuals of the vampires that are indeed lurking. Don't believe a word these assholes say, don't even bother to pirate their products, and don't you dare paying for that cycle to continue. Just look at them, point, laugh, and move on.",1358205004

5057277,comment,5054618,5054856,20,0,SiVal,,,"Tokenadult, I always enjoy your well-informed comments on topics such as this. I think you may have misinterpreted Stigler's 1999 ""The Teaching Gap"", though, as many of us did. In that book, he reports on a study of math teaching in the US, Japan, and Germany, and finds Japan's results to be far superior to the others and their teaching methods very different, and different in exactly the way you describe.<p>But he did a followup study involving more countries to see if most or all high-performing countries used the Japanese approach. It turned out that they did not. Some were more like the US than the US.<p>Here (<a href=""http://timssvideo.com/sites/default/files/Closing%20the%20Teaching%20Gap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timssvideo.com/sites/default/files/Closing%20the%20Te...</a>) is one place where Stigler reports his updated findings and attempts to debunk your (and my) initial conclusion---a conclusion that seemed strongly justified by his 1999 book---that, as you posted above, ""The more important difference between mathematics education in Japan...and the US is...the encouragement to pupils in Japan to try to figure things out for themselves.""<p>He points out that another high-performing country in his second study, Hong Kong, was more US-like and less Japan-like on this spectrum than the US itself. On the dimension you're calling ""more important"", the low-performing US is between the high-performing Hong Kong and the high-performing Japan.<p>His conclusion was that the main factor was not having kids figure things out for themselves but having teachers carefully teach kids the relationships among things. It didn't matter if the US kids spent time practicing procedures. The Chinese kids spent MORE time practicing procedures and did better, but then the Chinese teachers spent time directly pointing out important relationships, which the US teachers didn't do much of. The Japanese kids had to spend a lot of time figuring things out for themselves, but then the teachers would gather them together and carefully lead them to see relationships that they hadn't seen when working by themselves. The US teachers would tell kids to figure things out for themselves and basically leave their learning to whatever they managed to figure out.<p>Given equal IQ, time on task, etc., it's the effectiveness with which mathematical relationships are made clear to the students (part of which requires significant procedural drill, which Japanese kids do after school) that matters most. A lot of time is wasted in the US doing procedural drill with no conceptual understanding, with even more wasted on constructivist ""discovery"" methods whereby kids are supposed to somehow teach themselves and each other the mathematical relationships, and all of this led by teachers who aren't required by their union to even <i>know</i> anything about mathematical relationships much less teach them.",1358204848

But this only applies to high performing athletic schools (the ones you read about in the local paper that win county/state/regional titles). Other schools are purely volunteer efforts. The coach may be a teacher willing to give up free time everyday before and during the sports schedule.<p>For example, my history teacher was also the soccer coach. He wasn't great at it but someone had to wrangle a bunch of wiry teenagers and make them practice. He got nothing from it except the respect of his players.<p>The only teachers that get to chose their students are in governor's or magnet schools. Here students have to apply every year to be considered for the rigorous programs. Many teachers also apply for the job because of better pay, better students, and better curriculum. Teachers that don't perform can be fired.

2074627,comment,2074044,2074342,0,0,nostrademons,,,"He acknowledged the flaws in the data collection in the blog posts.<p>Anyway, this particular flaw doesn't quite work itself out the way you describe.  If you want to do out the numbers precisely, you'd multiply out the probability that a person enters a particular occupation given their degree by the lifetime earnings of that occupation, and then sum over all possible occupations.<p>So say (made up numbers) a CS major has an 80% chance of being a computer programmer ($1.5M), a 10% chance of being a quant ($5M), a 5% chance of being a successful entrepreneur ($20M), and a 5% chance of being a housewife ($0).  The expected value of the degree would be .8 * 1.5M + .1 * 5M + .05 * 20M + 0.<p>Then to find the baseline you'd do the same for lifetime earnings and occupation probabilities of someone who didn't go to college.  If they had a 10% chance of being a computer programmer, a 30% chance of being a barrista ($500k), a 40% chance of being a construction worker ($800k), and a 20% chance of being a househusband, that'd be .1 * 1.5M + .3 * 500 + .4 * 800 + 0.  Multiply out and subtract to find the value of the degree.<p>Remember that statistics is about making statements about <i>groups</i>, not statements about any particular <i>individual</i>.  That illustrates another pitfall of the data: the question a prospective student really wants answered is ""how much will the degree be worth <i>to me</i>"".  There's at least one study out there that suggests the answer is ""zero"": all the difference in lifetime earnings is due to correlation and not causation.  People succeed because of inborn traits like intelligence, perseverance, and the ability to delay gratitude, all of which also result in someone being able to get into an elite college and pick a challenging major.  But controlling for that effect opens up a whole other can of worms, one that you could bill your client another few thousand for writing about. ;-)",1294303205

Sorry couldn't resist some good will punning.<p>Anyways, I've always said (even when I was in high-school) that I'd just get a bachelors degree from the most reputable University I can afford without going into debt. These days I'm still missing one year of a Financial Engineering degree, but I'm earning almost twice (and quite a bit more in some cases) what most of my high-school graduating classmates are making after getting their Bachelors and Masters, and I just took a new job paying 22% more with an awful lot of benefits as a Lead UX/Systems Developer (yeah I have a weird mix of responsibilities, but they're exactly the responsibilities I wanted to have, as I quite enjoy both sides of the equation) for a big software company in my country. Take in account that I went to a recognized private school, so you could say my classmates where predestined to at least make a modest living without having to resort to flipping burgers at McDonalds.<p>So there. I learnt everything I know by reading, programming, and designing on my own. I was able to secure my first job pretty easily (I was 19 at the time) since I was one of the three persons out of a pool of 85 people who passed a simple test for a job working for a company that made shopping cart and merchant software. They hired me because even though the other two had degrees, I had done significantly better than they had on the test and trust me, I wasn't/am not a genius or anything or that sort.<p>I guess my point is that a degree is a must have because it's a great thing to fall back on if you ever need it and it can help your formation and tune your thought process, but it is by no means a silver bullet for actually achieving a great education nor does it make it a given that you'll do better in the job market. Make sure you learn what you need to learn, regardless of where you learn it, and make sure that you really learn to sell yourself instead of letting a piece of paper dictate how you do in life.<p>Oh and by the way... bachelor degrees are so passe this days. If you want offers based on your degrees more then your proven experience, opt for a masters degree as fast as you can.",1294302174

The basic idea is that you look at the median achievement scores for students the year before they enter a teacher's classroom and the year after and see how they compare (of course this is vulnerable to schools with students who transfer frequently).  Then, you can say for example, on average does a student who was below grade level, stay below grade level, or improve?  This allows one to get some handle on what the impact is of the teacher--for good or worse--the LAtimes study found that the differences in teacher impact were rather high--within the same school.  Also, some teachers were happy to learn about the results--for example, some teachers were enthusiastic, but were not aware that their overall impact was not so high and wanted to know how they could improve.  Now, I wouldn't use this as the only metric because it might not be linear--for example, perhaps it's harder to get a large improvement for say a group of gifted kids (relative to their previous scores), compared to moving students who are somewhat below grade level to slightly above grade level--but at least it indicates the direction that the teacher is (on average) sending students.

One quote from a while ago: ""There are no aims of education. The aim is education. If -- and only if -- you seek it... education will find you.""  From what I know of my UChicago friends, they really downplay majors and emphasize their liberal-arts core.<p>In other words, it seems that education is generally a pursuit for personal enrichment, unless you happen to love whatever field will make you money (I thank my lucky stars that I'm in computer science and my internships are quite well paid; my friends in other disciplines like journalism are not so lucky).<p>I have generally judged people who major in economics here but hate it (it's a big thing at Northwestern, since we don't have undergrad business).  It always seemed like those people are saying ""I want to get into a good business school and then stuff myself into a suit for the next 40 years""; it's a depressing analysis of one's own strengths.  But then again, maybe those people are just smart and I'm just lucky.<p>I also wish we'd work with kids on finances before they pick a college.  Here at Northwestern, student loans are capped at $20k.  It's one of the most expensive schools in the US, but the financial aid office does try to keep its students from drowning in debt.  Other schools, though, don't really care how much debt students rack up, and they're the ones with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to work on.",1294300848

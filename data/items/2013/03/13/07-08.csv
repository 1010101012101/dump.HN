5367312,comment,5366154,5367145,6,0,nitrogen,,,"May I ask whether you have much experience as a sole proprietor or solo founder?<p>As a solo founder of a startup that I've been running for almost the past four years, if I had anyone in my network that wasn't scared to death of leaving the comfort of a full-time job behind to join me as a cofounder, I would have brought them on board in a heartbeat.<p>One reason a technology startup is significantly more stressful than a standard business is that, by definition, you are in uncharted territory.  Traditional businesses have loads of successful examples; the business model and value proposition to customers are both largely consistent.  With most tech startups, you have to <i>invent</i> a new business model, create new technology fron scratch, and convince customers that your never-before-seen product or service is something they should spend their hard-earned money on.<p>1. The business model: Though there are a few general patterns available for web startups to use (e.g. freemium, ad-supported), every startup has to figure out how to become profitable within its particular niche.  It's unlikely you'll find success by copying someone else's model exactly, while you can do exactly that in the small business world.  Startups selling physical products (such as mine) likely don't even have freemium or advertising as options for experimentation, though there are some product startups exploring variations of those options.<p>2. The technology: Writing code and designing user interfaces is <i>nothing</i> like repairing cars.  There's no doubt that there are a lot of intelligent, knowledgeable mechanics (even some who are also software developers), but there's a very large difference between understanding an existing system, and creating a new system from nothing but keystrokes.  The common tasks of the mechanic can be done almost by instinct and memorization, leaving sufficient mental horsepower available for the few particularly tricky problems.  Most startup-worthy software projects will involve intense creative effort at every step of development, which is far more mentally taxing.<p>3. Value proposition: Consumers already know they need a mechanic, or food, or a dentist.  As a restaurateur, for example, you mostly need to convince willing consumers to come to <i>your</i> restaurant instead of your competition.  A tech startup has to convince customers that they need to spend money on an entirely new category of product.  Most people will agonize over the smallest expenditure if it's not part of their traditional purchase sphere (purchasphere?).<p>In summary, the stresses of running a tech startup, <i>especially</i> for someone in their 20s with <i>at most</i> a couple tens of thousands in savings, are far beyond what most solo founders can bear, and only those who are determined beyond reason (or already rich) should dream of going it alone.",1363160365

It makes more sense to think about it as a form of advertising/marketing. You see, media companies NEVER have sales. The closest you'll get is watching 20 minutes of ads per hour on cable TV while footing a pretty intense bill in addition.<p>For over 100 years, it's been sound business sense to give things away to increase market penetration and drive increased sales. Sales bring buyers who also tend to make other purchases, which leads them to advertising to their friends. Giving things away to people who broadcast the products to a large audience is advertising 101. Loss-leading is a modern strategy that is working very well for expensive electronics. It works by essentially giving people technology so that they can consume more easily, expecting them to compensate you for the difference over time.<p>This is all identical to how I have actually seen piracy affect the media industry. It's literally just marketing. People who pirate stuff typically aren't people who would buy it anyway. I really do not see a negative impact whatsoever. There's so much evidence to the contrary that I find someone making a claim that ""piracy made more difficult, content sales up"" is anything other than a context-free juxtaposition of facts absolutely inane. Piracy is easier today than it ever has been. For < $200 in hardware you can have your own personal Netflix but with all the latest movies and TV shows. Yet sales continue to rise, and the failed and hassle-filled pre-internet business models are falling away, leading to a minimal-cost sampled environment where the need for something like piracy is growing smaller all the time.<p>Then there are some industries that are devolving and paying for it severely. Remember demo disks when we were all kids? I could, every week, get a demo disk with all the latest games on it. Maybe I got to play 10% of the game, but I didn't have to go pay $60 to see if I liked it. Now that digital purchases are non-resellable, fewer and fewer companies offer demos of their games to people so they can try before they buy. Piracy is useful here, and still tends to be an advertisement rather than a hindrance. And these companies want us to buy into always-on, in-your-face, and anti-consumer DRM? They're making it harder to consume legitimately! That's the exactly wrong thing to do! I haven't pirated a game in a long, long while. But I haven't bought any either (except a few indie games and the humble bundles) because the industry seems to be incapable of making any good business decisions.<p>So yes. It really is so far-fetched that closing down a ""major"" (what, <5% of all piracy?) piracy site would increase legitimate downloads by even 1 sale.",1363159793

Getting into a debate as a scientist would suggest there is something to discuss scientifically, there is not. Richard Dawkins voiced this publicly many times.<p>Furthermore, and more importantly, avoiding public debate is very different from changing the results of your research. If you are implying that some people have results that support creationism and keep it to themselves, I would like to hear more about this. I cannot even imagine how you would conduct scientific research on creationism.<p>Another point: you are using the word ""confess"" which has negative connotations. It is perfectly normal for a funding agency to voice their concerns on, e.g., the design of an experiment, if they can think of an improvement. There is nothing wrong with this, there is nothing to ""confess"". In some cases the agency might be altering the design to game the results. That <i>is</i> wrong, of course; but your phrasing is too general.<p>If noone really knows, than maybe nothing substantial is happening. ""slightly threatening phone-call from the funding agency"" sounds near paranoid. And again, your wording is way too general.

Now, the trick to achieving and maintaining that caloric deficit over a period of time is an effort that is psychologically demanding, absolutely.

You have to take into consideration many factors and you can't just automatically ascribe declining or increasing revenues to one fact, even if it seems plausible. You can't just make up a model full of assumptions and attach fancy names and mathematical symbols to it. No decent judge would fall for that. To start with you would have to make a year-on-year comparison spanning 5-10 years. Then you would have to make a convincing argument why the revenues didn't just decline or increase due to one of the many other possible factors such as popularity of the movies, internet penetration, broadband access, weather, macro economic trends, changes in taste, normal seasonal changes, supply of alternatives (cable tv shows, sport games etc.), changes in payment options for the legal movie outlets, other changes in business model or marketing that could explain why the legal movie outlets sold more after the shutdown.<p>If the product had been more generic that might have been possible but with movies the popularity of the supply varies so much that changes could often be ascribed to differences in popularity.",1363159173

Prison population is as always growing.<p>My conclusion:<p>We need to deal better, more honestly with inflow of unemployed that will not subside. 50% (or higher) unemployment is perfectly fine and eventual inevitability.

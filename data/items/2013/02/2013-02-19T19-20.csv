The control problem is very hard, but the perception problem perhaps even harder, Especially when most of the processing needs to be done onboard because you need the perception to be part of the control loop and work at reasonably high frequencies. Higher-level perception tasks such as identifying power lines or people are even further out.",1361303974

5246659,comment,5244192,5244192,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"It seems that the NYT article misunderstands what online courses are for. The purpose isn't to <i>replace</i> four-year undergraduate college, but to serve the vast majority of people for whom that model is impractical. There are a lot of people who want to learn things who can't afford this American institution of playing aristocrat for the 4 years in which society judges them to be economically marginal.<p>The 90% attrition rate of MOOCs, by the way, is the result of a course model that's still being fleshed out and the fact that, absent a high degree of previous investment, social expectations and abundant free time, very few people are going to stick with a long-term program. Ten percent yield for a free MOOC is great! For my part, I think the question of whether these courses should be served synchronously (with schedules and deadlines) or asynchronously is unclear, and I'm not sure how the trade-offs of each will be balanced. It's an exciting space, though.<p>I don't think online education will replace the university, but it might replace the institution of four-year college. Academia brought this on itself. The majority of the leading professors have long held the attitude that teaching is commodity grunt work and research is what they really do. Technology is responding, by bringing teaching to the masses. If the result of this is that middle-class families stop dedicating 850 millihouses per student to tuition, then I can't see how that's a bad thing. I'd like to see undergraduate college live through this, but I wouldn't mind seeing it shrink back to something for people who are genuinely interested in learning the material, and something <i>affordable</i> for people of average means.",1361303900

As for training, invest in a high quality foam roller and get ""The Stick"".  Learn to enjoy the pain you inflict on yourself with these devices. They will help, and it hurts less the more you do it.  Don't try to run through pain, well, most pain. That's your body telling you something is not right! Could be a muscle imbalance that can be fixed by stretching and some simple exercises.  Find a good massage therapist and let them introduce you to a new world of pain.  A good one can read your muscles like a book and tell you that your ankle pain is actually being caused by an unhappy muscle in your butt.  Remember, the foot bone is connected to the leg bone, leg bone is connected to the hip bone.  If something is wrong in one of those spots, it will propagate to other areas.<p>Probably the most important thing, don't be concerned about time.

As a general rule, COBRA will be a lot more expensive than an individual plan, unless pre-existing conditions are involved, especially if you are young.  In all likelihood it will also be more expensive than a group plan in your case.  I don't know how New York works, but in Maryland small businesses can enroll in a small group health plan.  Costs are based on the average age of the employees in the company.  Can pick the level of benefits.

Now I don't need to panic when the whole screen stops updating.<p>The ""snap"" window dragging feature is broken in the presence of multiple monitors; as you drag the mouse across the monitor boundary, the mouse pointer becomes momentarily disconnected from the window location, so that you are moving the window as if by a long invisible stick, not by its original grab location.<p>The overlay scrollbars don't interact well with Eclipse; JUnit running tests outputs file paths that Eclipse turns into hyperlinks, and the hyperlink mouseover stops the scrollbar from from being triggered when the pointer approaches the child window border.

With some difficulty and playing around with preference managers that come with warning labels, I've rebound the keys to a slightly more usable window switcher.<p>Oh, and the fun I had when I tried to bind Ctrl+Alt+F12 to a command in Eclipse; took me back decades to switching terminals with Alt+F keys.<p>In short, Ubuntu Unity is horrifically bad.

In descending order of payoff, they must be (where ""I"" describes the player whose payoff is being considered, and ""you"" is the other player; this is the same for both players):<p><pre><code>  I defect, you cooperate
  I cooperate, you cooperate
  I defect, you defect
  I cooperate, you defect
</code></pre>
There are two important features that come from this set of payoffs: (defect, defect) is the only Nash Equilibrium -- the only point where a unilateral strategy change by any player makes their payoff worse, and defection is a dominant strategy for each player (that is, without knowing the other players chosen strategy, each player knows they can maximize their own payoff by defection.)<p>The actual ordering of payoffs for this exercise is:<p><pre><code>  I cooperate, you cooperate (I get 100% on test with no risk)
  I defect, you cooperate; or I defect, you defect (I get whatever score I would get from taking the test, which is never better than 100%, and could be worse) 
  I cooperate, you defect (I get 0% on the test)
</code></pre>
In this case, both cooperate/cooperate and defect/defect are Nash Equilibria, and, unlike in the Prisoner's Dilemma, and there is no dominant strategy. This is a game that has much more room for cooperation than PD, because cooperation in PD always means giving up a gain that you could have realized, where in this case cooperation is the ideal self-interested behavior if the other player is cooperating.",1361303492

We all ate a ton of food and lost fat and almost all of us lost weight.  If anything, our caloric intake stayed the same or went up.<p>(BTW: the goal wasn't to lose weight.  It was to become healthier.  Last month, someone improved their cholesterol numbers by 93 points by eating that way.)<p>Assume there are 3,500 calories in 1 pound of body fat.<p>Then cut, say, 300 calories daily out of your diet for, say, 3 years.<p>That's 109,500 calories a year or 328,500 calories over 3 years.<p>328,500 calories divided by 3,500 calories/pound is 93 pounds.<p>The math isn't that straight forward, but many people use the very math to explain weight loss, at least in the short term.  I just can't buy into the math that 'calories in' equals 'calories out'.<p>That said, I've done the 30-day challenge three times, not restricted my caloric intake, and still lost weight (lost fat quicker than I gained muscle mass).  So, even in the short-term, you can lose weight without restricting calories.<p>* Cutting carbs typically means people end up eating less calories*<p>Mostly true, but ore specifically, cutting carbs means that you are sending less sugar into your body.  Less sugar means it is more difficult for the body to produce fat.  Fat is more dense than muscle and the reason most people diet is to lose the fat.<p>I am not sure this is scientifically accurate, but this is how I make sense of it:<p>When I eat Paleo, my body thinks it is surround by high quality energy sources.  It gets fed those energy sources frequently.  The body recognizes that there is low risk that it will go a short period of time without high quality energy.  It determines that it has little use for the fat it has stored on the body.  The body then converts the fat into energy.  Your body enters into a phase where you go for weeks (or months) of high energy because of all the fat you are burning by eating a lot of high quality food---food a caveman would eat.",1361303396

5246456,comment,5245086,5245821,1,0,hsitz,,,"I agree that ""just get out and run"" isn't really helpful for training for a marathon.  It helps to have a plan and to follow one of the many training plans.  For example, you can do 25 mile weeks by running 4 miles a day 7 days a week or by running 3 or 4 days a week with purposefully different workouts (e.g, long run, tempo run, recovery run, etc.)  The purposeful workouts are going to give far more bang for your buck.<p>Also, one long run per week -- building up to 20 miles or so a month before marathon -- is the mainstay of most good marathon training plans.  It's foolish to run a marathon without having prepared with some ""long runs"".  And you'd be surprised at how slowly you can run the long runs in order for them to be beneficial.  In fact, pushing yourself too hard on them is more likely to do harm than good.<p>It also helps to look over the various training plans to find out what works, specifically regarding training mileage and training speed.  You don't need to do much if any ""speed work"" for a marathon, certainly not if you're not planning to do at least sub 3:30 or so.<p>Finally, people should be aware that based on your training runs and a practice 5k,10k, or half-marathon, you should be able to gauge your likely performance in a marathon quite well.  This is of paramount importance, because you have to know what you're capable of and pace yourself properly in a marathon.  Many first-timers (and many who who have run multiple marathons) run the first 13 miles of marathon way too fast, which is partly understandable because the proper pace feels quite slow and easy in first half of the race.  But it has bad consequences.  There is a saying that ""For each 10 seconds per mile faster than your goal pace during first half of marathon means you'll be running 60 seconds per mile slower than goal pace in second half.""  Or hit the wall and not finish at all.  Even pacing is the key.",1361302019

Now it is a fatter HTML(+Haml), along with CSS(+Sass/Less), JavaScript+jQuery+Backbone(+CoffeeScript), Ruby+Ruby on Rails+RSpec/Python+Django, and potentially others, none of which are getting any simpler. It's already become impractical for neophyte developers to learn the ways of the web versus Android/iOS.<p>The main issue is that we would have to design a successor to the web that is so much better that it's worth jumping ship and obsoleting the huge amount of work put into building the web, and worth the work of creating and maintaining ports for every platform and convincing millions of people and thousands of developers that it's the future, in the midst of a cold war between the open web and walled garden platforms.<p>I plan on writing a post with my design for such a successor :) This is something more people should be discussing.

In fact, sensitive industrial information is primarily to be found in the firms themselves, which means that industrial espionage is carried out primarily by attempting to obtain the information via employees or infiltrators or by breaking into internal computer networks. Only where sensitive data is sent outside via cable or radio (satellite) can a communications surveillance system be used for industrial espionage. This occurs systematically in the following three cases:<p>- in connection with firms which operate in three times zones, so that interim results are sent from Europe to America and then on to Asia;
- in the case of videoconferences in multinational companies conducted by VSAT or cable;<p>- when important contracts have to be negotiated locally (construction of facilities, telecommunications infrastructure, rebuilding of transport systems, etc.), and the firm's representatives have to consult their head office.<p>If firms fail to protect their communications in such cases, interception can provide competitors with valuable data""",1361300721

Cut out all the simple carbs (which includes the bags of sugar we've cultivated as most fruit) and focus on fats, protein and very complex carbs and you will lose weight. More importantly, nothing has been shown to affect metabolic disorder[2] as positively.<p>I look at it like this: what do we use to fatten cattle up before we slaughter them? It's corn. Now look at every nutrition label to see what is in it. Is it surprising we are fat, too?<p>1. The body is incredibly complex. There are people who will respond better on other diets.

The key technologies behind the industrial revolution (from the steam engine onwards) were invented in England, then imported to the USA, which improved them further.<p>If you trace backwards, part of the reason why England had the economic foundation for that was a major importation of artisans from the Netherlands after William of Orange became king of England.<p>And the Netherlands gained the foundations for its wealth from skills that the Sephardic Jews took to the Netherlands as they fled the growing religious intolerance in Spain as the Inquisition got under its way.<p>And so for hundreds of years each top world power has seen the major foundations of its prosperity be based on knowledge and skills gained from the previous one.  Is it any surprise that the cycle would repeat again now that the USA is the top world power?  It may feel like history inevitably leads to now, but there is no reason to believe that the economic dominance of the USA will last longer than previous world empires.",1365479883

It sucks to have to make a meal out of sides, and it seems like the meals are structured most of the time such that quinoa salad or mac & cheese are perceived as being sides. And I don't think the solution is to tell meat-eaters not to eat vegetables - everyone deserves them. Anyway, I have to be very aggressive about getting to the front of the line for food. Also, sometimes the vegetarian option is just lo mein or a green salad - it rarely meets what I would consider a minimal nutritional standard of ~10-20 grams of protein. I pack protein powder to supplement my lunch. To be fair though, it is tasty!",1365479691

The Wikipedia article gives an accounting of other areas of technology that were home built, even in the early days of the republic. The US was technologically self-sufficient along many dimensions, from agriculture to transportation. It had certain gaps in manufacturing technology because of the nature of British mercantilism (raw materials were exported to Britain and reimported as finished goods into America, which suppressed the development of native manufacturing).<p>In any case, stealing technology has been a much more fundamental part of the recent prosperity of China and India. Their societies are almost wholly dependent on Western technology. In comparison, the U.S. was always a prosperous country, even during colonial times.",1365479679

The only ""FE"" development I've done with Access is simple database maintenance tools usually only used by the developer(me) or a trained maintainer.<p>Also, most people are comfortable with Excel. Access userforms can scare the crap out of some users, but they're able to manipulate Excel just fine.<p>I was able to whip up a tool for my boss where his direct reports could log the time they spend on a particular project each day (ridiculous, I know). It's a simple Excel spreadsheet with  Excels built in calendar selector, and two columns: Project and hours. Clicking a button writes to an Access database, which my boss can now pull the data straight into Excel with a couple canned reports. No one ever sees anything but Excel. I get that this may not be ideal but:\n1. Took a morning to get to production\n2. Quick user uptake because they're already comfortable with the system\n3. Gets the job done, and my boss can still mess around with the numbers in excel all he likes<p>So there are use cases.<p>Another one that I've used successfully is utilizing Access as a middle-man to join two discrete systems within a corporation by using the Import Linked Table feature and building a join query.

Nearly every large corporation in the world uses VPNs for employee computers. The ""majority"" of VPN users are not people trying to ""hide"" illicit activity, the majority are highly security conscious or they're road-warriors on questionable hotel connections among a variety of other non-criminal use cases.<p>When we started icouch.me while in Shanghai, China, PayPal flagged my account and constantly locked it even though I jumped through their hoops ""proving"" our legitimacy and that no transactions (at that time) were actually China-originated. Just the simple fact that I logged on from China caused us to get locked out of our payments for up to weeks at a time (even though they still had no problem collecting the fees from our still-incoming transactions.) Then once I got that nonsense sorted, I started traveling more frequently for the company. So when I arrived in New York City, once again I was locked out of my account for 5 business days for ""security"" reasons, even though we've never had a single chargeback or any sort of security complaint or issue. Then I worked out of Texas for several weeks and once again, my account was locked. Despite the fact that we had the same US corporate bank account since 2010 (when the company was first founded.) By using a VPN, I was able to ensure my US ""presence"" to manage our business without PayPal's ridiculously retarded IP-detection security lockouts. I've since told paypal to go suck an egg and we use Stripe for everything.<p>When a company like PayPal can hold my operational funds hostage for weeks at a time with no way to clear it up expeditiously, then they just became thieves. They're making interest off of MY money while I can't access it. If they were ""really"" worried about security, then they'd block all transactions as well. But no, they have no problem taking money.<p>Interestingly, the credit bureau websites are locked to US only IPs as well. So if you have a subscription to some credit-monitoring service, they'll gladly take your money even if you can't access their services with a non-US IP address.<p>Those folks can all go to hell. It isn't my problem that some russian and nigeria scam artists have a tendency to cause problems. The IP address isn't the issue -- it's the security of their overall application. They're using geo-location as a shorthand for actually doing their job in securing their site.<p>Interestingly, I can access my US Chase bank account, my Simple account, Fidelity Investment account, Stripe from around the world without any sort of of VPN, yet somehow PayPal can't seem to figure out how to get security or customer service right.",1365477668

A quick look at that link and I can see that many of the issues you highlight are related to citation styles. We have made some good progress there with our citation style editor. We have also made plenty of improvements since that post. If you felt that some of the problems were limiting your research, we have a support team (support@mendeley.com) and also points of contact on twitter (if that's your thing).\nAs for software engineers, we have a very talented and expert team but we are proud to say that we will be adding to the team soon so that we can improve and iterate more rapidly and solidly.",1365477297

5516219,comment,5511863,5514571,1,0,philwelch,,,"> Unless you like manually tracking parents of a commit<p>Git tracks the parents of a commit. There are ways to visualize that, even with command-line git. When you do this, it's usually clear which branch is master and which branch was the feature branch, and since the merge commit has a default commit message like ""merge <<branch-name>> to master"" it's even easier to figure out.<p>It's also entirely possible to use a Git workflow where you rebase your branches onto master before merging then in with a fast-forward, which means there are no merge commits. This workflow usually involves squashing. Conversely, you can use a workflow where you never fast-forward merge to master, in which case master is the branch that consists of a series of commits called ""merge <<branch-name>> to master"".",1365476956

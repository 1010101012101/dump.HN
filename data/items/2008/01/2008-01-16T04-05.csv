When I have a budget for advertising, I tend to use it up quickly; but when I don't, I spend a lot of time thinking of ideas to get free promotion in other ways. Lack of resources does push you to be more innovative. The only downside is if you find your fundded competitor spending on marketing and getting all the buzz and attention while no one ever talks about you.",1200459363

99080,comment,98836,98836,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"what do you think of the book itself (Programming Collective Intelligence)?<p>It might be just me but I found the book fairly useless. All the author does is take some ultra basic AI/Machine Learning algorithms and build some bare bones web 2.0 type scenarios around it. The chapters on neural networks, svms and decision trees struck me as particularly primitive. A lot of additional work would need to be done (e.g: nomalizing  data for the NNs) before those algorithms would be useful in a real world context.<p>An ok  book if you know nothing at all about AI/machine learning. I wonder how much value it actually provides. I might be missing something. If you think so feel free to correct me.",1200457578

It'd be sweet if they could combine the new Time Capsule (terabyte hard drive + Airport Extreme) with the Apple TV.  That would be a really nice device.",1200457416
99078,comment,99053,99053,0,0,utnick,,,"to be honest i'm tired of all this language talk. The fanboism  surrounding lisp, haskell, arc, scheme, erlang, and other less popular languages is getting to be a little too much<p>Languages don't matter!<p>When I first started programming, I was so impressed by superhackers who knew like 10 languages or were experts in obscure ones like Forth and whatnot. Then as I learned more languages, I realized that languages are just interfaces into the computer system. Thats it.<p>Arc won't be able to do anything that binary code can't do.<p>This is nothing against pg. If you want to create a language because that interests you. Great! I'm just tired of all the elitist fanboys mentally masturbating over how great their language is. maybe i just read programming.reddit too much tho ;)",1200457322

You don't add<p>> anything... you only take away. Dignity is deadly.""<p>I'm a Dreamhost client, and I've been pretty happy with their overall service.  This isn't the first time they've admitted doing something stupid.<p>Before Dreamhost, I was a client of Westhost.  They were fine too, until they instituted a major migration to virtual servers.<p>It was a disaster.<p>Site response time slowed to a crawl, and their forums were saturated with angry customers.  Trouble ticket response time went from hours to days.<p>Westhost handled the situation ""professionally"".  By this, I mean they did not acknowledge the problem for several days.  They eventually posted apologies and explanations that contained no information about the root cause - just empty words.<p>""Professional"" can mean a lot of things.  It usually means ""Cover your ass"".<p>The problems persisted for weeks.  I'm sure Westhost has since resolved the technical problems with the virtual domains (since they are still in business).  But their ""professional"" communication with customers made me leave.<p>The deal with Dreamhost is:<p>1) When they do something stupid, they admit it immediately and take their lumps.<p>2) They come across as a bunch of clowns sometimes.<p>I don't think you can have (1) without (2).  Maybe it can be done, but Dreamhost won't be the company to do it.  Their company DNA is pretty well fixed.",1200456821

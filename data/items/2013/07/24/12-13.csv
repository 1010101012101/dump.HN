6095792,comment,6094486,6094486,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"The problem is how permissive PyPI is. I can upload a package called django2 with the description that this is the new generation of the Django framework and run arbitrary code on a whole lot of machines of many unsuspecting developers. The reason Linux distributions do not generally have this problem is that there is an air gap between the upstream developer and the repository in the form of a maintainer who reads the code and verifies that it is not malicious. Incidentally, GitHub has the same problem as PyPI. With good SEO I can create a repo called django and have it be the first thing that new developers find.<p>One possible solution to this is to have a core group of maintainers verify the most popular packages. I place my trust in the maintainer and the maintainer signs a specific version of the package. This will not scale to 100% of the packages, but that is fine. As long as django, flask, psycopg2, etc. are signed I can take responsibility for reviewing django-pretty-snarfs-with-smiles myself. That is essentially our trust model with GitHub already: you blindly download large official looking projects but read through the code of small stuff (right?). Perhaps after a while some developers become trusted and get to have their signing process fast-tracked.<p>At the end of the day if I could have one improvement it would be a big fat warning that pip gives you that says &quot;what you are about to install is likely malicious code. Do not do it without verifying that it is not by manually downloading it and reading the source.&quot;<p>BTW, simply running &quot;pip install foo&quot; will let foo&#x27;s setup.py run arbitrary code on your machine. It is such a giant security hole by design that I cringe every time I have to use it.<p>Edit: another potential model is for PyPI to punt the verification onto outside entities, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. Basically instead off building my packages on my (potentially compromised machine), I would tag a version of it on GitHub and instruct PyPI to build it. It is easy to establish trust between PyPI and GitHub, so the guarantee you get with PyPI is &quot;this package came from exactly this source&quot; where you can read the source before installing it. Like I said above, GitHub also has a trust model problem but this would reduce the amount of work one would need to do to verify a package from two places to one.",1374669495

There are plenty of little pieces of advice in this book, a couple of which I highlighted in my reply - those I&#x27;d indicate are good rules to live by if you don&#x27;t want to have to dig deeper. They don&#x27;t answer your question directly, because choosing a font is only <i>one</i> choice amongst many important choices you make in presenting information, and probably middling in importance. So don&#x27;t only ask that question, and note that it&#x27;s only one chapter in this book - there are lots of little decisions which go into typography which I&#x27;d learn first.<p>To say that isn&#x27;t to imply that it takes a lifetime, or that no-one should learn, or that non-designers somehow threaten designers (!), just that it&#x27;s a complex topic which rewards study. I&#x27;d absolutely encourage you to learn a little about typography, designer or not, it&#x27;s a fascinating subject, but like most subjects rules of thumb vary depending on who you ask, and it&#x27;s hard to condense it into just a few rules (though this book is one such attempt). Here&#x27;s some refs on typography:<p>Just My Type - a fun introduction to the subject for the layperson<p>Counterpunch by Fred Smeijers - perhaps a bit dry, but I found it engaging, a history of type<p>The Elements of Typographic Style - perhaps a bit dry, but informative<p>Those books go into detail about different types of fonts and their meaning (which is tied up in their origins), but also all the other little things that dictate the form of our thoughts on the page.<p>If you want a more superficial guide, then I&#x27;d simply say just pick one mainstream sans and one serif, and you won&#x27;t go too far wrong in your font choice. You&#x27;re unlikely to find a more useful summary of where to use which fonts without lots more detail, because the right answer is <i>it depends</i>, and there are other more important choices you make when styling text.",1374669492

A goal would help a lot.  I searched the article and the comments for the word &quot;goal&quot; and found nothing.  It is an OK laundry list of several tools and techniques and their strengths and weaknesses in general.  Most of the tools listed do pretty easily solve certain problems; however how those easily solved problems relate to the undefined problem is apparently inadequate.  That is not the fault of the tools.  Also it is not an exhaustive list of all possible techs/tools.  Perhaps the topic he has not googled for yet which meets the unspecified goal is &quot;SSL certs&quot; or &quot;SSH host keys in DNSSEC secured zones&quot;.<p>Without a defined goal, rudderless drifting is unavoidable.  This applies to a lot more than computational system designs.<p>Reading between the lines and doing some creative writing about something I find interesting, I am guessing what he&#x27;s asking for is some kind of mandatory peer review/code audit of git commits aka the dude who writes code is never allowed to merge the code, at minimum, and the dude who writes unit tests is never allowed to write code, and all devs have to be in the &quot;big&quot; GPG WoT off a major public keyserver not just one little project.  Because I have no idea what problem he&#x27;s trying to solve, this particular solution to a problem, although somewhat interesting, may not have anything to do with his actual goal.<p>The irony is hilarious because there is at least some disagreement on what the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; really is, outside this discussion.

Being a mass publishing medium is what has kept the internet in anarchy thus far. In some cases, I think it will be possible to regulate publishers with some success. If you can get 10-20 companies to comply, you&#x27;re covering most of the web.<p>For porn, that&#x27;s not going to work. But, a filter probably will.<p>Censorship and contend restrictions don&#x27;t need to be airtight. They never are. It&#x27;s enough to just move things from mainstream to marginal. Seeing breasts, arses & fleeting (preferably comical) glimpses of balls is normal and OK, but unadvisable for young children. Genitalia in non sexual contexts is new, but now OK too (thank you embarrassing bodies). You can watch that with your friends or teenage kids. Genitalia in a sexual context is not OK. You look at that alone with a laptop in shame. You have to buy it from licensed sex shops with darkened windows.<p>Regulations & mainstream public opinion cross influence each other but actual line is more or less defined by TV standards and practices.<p>All internet porn (or political opinion or any subject of cencorship) filtering has to do is reclaim the control of that line. If you have to call up and ask for porn access or use tor to get it, it might let them do that.",1374667219

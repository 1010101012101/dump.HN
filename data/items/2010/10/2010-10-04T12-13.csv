1755480,comment,1754239,1754718,0,0,ekidd,,,"Interesting! How do you know your algorithm handles the tricky corner cases? I'd imagine you need to write down all the corner cases, write a formal proof for each, and hope that (1) your proof is correct, and (2) your code actually matches your proof. Could you elaborate on how you do this?<p>Here are a few corner cases I can think of for word-wrapping:<p>1) The line is empty.<p>2) The line is 1 character shorter/1 character longer/exactly the same length as the wrap limit.<p>3) The first break point for the line falls before/after/on the wrap limit.<p>4) The first character(s) of the newly-wrapped line are spaces.<p>I don't think that I could just eyeball a word-wrap algorithm and know that it handles all these cases correctly. I would, at a minimum, need to check each case. But at that point, I'm just as well off writing test cases, and allowing the computer to verify that my algorithm does the right thing for each. Of course, that's not as good as a proof by induction for each desired property, but it's a _lot_ less work, and it's almost always adequate. And I don't need to worry about mistakes in my proof.<p>Am I misunderstanding something about your approach? How would you handle this?",1286196904

But the payoff is so lousy. From what I can see, you'll tinker and tinker with the DIY scanner just to get it to keep the pages in focus and well illuminated, and to get the software workflow pieced together. Then, because you probably don't have a big budget or a machine shop, you won't get a robot that turns the pages, even an imperfect one that skips pages and occasionally mangles a book. ;) You'll have to turn the pages yourself, by hand. That labor all by itself is more expensive then 90% of my books.<p>Meanwhile, the Scansnap is the real thing. My favorite piece of tech gear in years. It just works. The images come out nice. My magazine pages fit perfectly on the iPad screen.<p>Google has done all the hard work, of course, robotics, professional book-handlers, and all. Pity that I can't access most of the fruits of that.<p>So at some point you just have to try and convince yourself that it is no longer 1500 and printed books are a cheap commodity. As the article points out: Publishers routinely destroy printed books. They're just ink and paper. Even most of the books you think of as priceless collectibles are not particularly priceless. The really expensive part of an out-of-print book is the ability to read the words. If you want to decorate a room in beautifully bound old books, any old book will do.<p>And, thanks to the economics of publishing, most of my really hard-to-find out-of-print books are old trade paperbacks printed on cheap paper. It will be a challenge to preserve these books through my lifetime anyway. Rather than wait until the things age and fall apart, I might as well take them apart myself.<p>And this is how I argue to myself. But still, it's hard to bring myself to use that saw. What we need is a market in sawn-up books. Just rent a copy of your rare book that's already unbound and ready for scanning. Sell it on to someone else when you're done with it. Then you can keep the original rare book (in storage, somewhere upstate) but read the text whenever you want. The fact that this (AFAIK; IANAL) is legal but simply Bittorrenting a book you don't own is not is a very clear example of the brokenness of our legal system.",1286195766

And I'm not talking bars, I'm talking those who are busy actually doing stuff, especially if it's stuff they're working on in their own time (a passion for something).<p>And the answer to myself was in the community channels for a given tech. For the most part this was freenode IRC rooms, but sometimes it's Google Groups.<p>The important thing with approaching people through these channels is not to go in cold or piss them off. But as this should be an area which you know too (or your CTO does, or other devs you have does), then you should open the dialogue in their comfort zone.<p>Encourage use of the channels and just watch for a bit to see who is giving answers to other people... they're the ones who know what they're doing, and they're the influencers.<p>Once you know who they are, ask them if they're looking for work, where they're located (timezones help here, if you're in the UK go in early in the morning and you mostly have europeans, and if you're in the US go in late as you mostly have Americans). Even if they're not looking, they may very well know someone in the channel who is looking and they will recommend a good person.<p>Does this method work? Yes, for me it has done.<p>Using HN to hire is one example of this (and we found a terrific graduate who started today), and I did the same with the android-dev IRC channel to get a great Android dev.

But that's because the problems I work on are far more complicated these days.<p>Back in the day, 320x200 - 40 columns x 25 rows - Commodore 64 seemed OK, until I saw the hires mode on an Amstrad CPC 64 - with 640x200, giving 80 columns. All these were huge luxuries compared to the 20x1 LCD character screen I mention in another comment here, of course.<p>But the point is, the problems you'd tackle are smaller too. Just ad-hoc things: probably simple mashups using maps, GPS and connectivity; algorithm implementation to satisfy curiosity, or to learn in idle time, or even to brute force a puzzler in a newspaper column. There was an iPhone game, Fling, which I spent 20 minutes writing up a solver for, on my laptop. I'd have liked to do it on the phone instead.",1286195459

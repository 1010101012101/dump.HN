You realise this, yet it's never enough and you compare yourself to the cream of the crop or 'what you could be'.<p>You need to stop this. Constantly wishing for something more while feeling unhappy with where you are 'in the moment' is a bad state of mind. It is not how you want to experience your life and it is certainly not reflective of what you have already achieved. (Many happy people achieve a lot less!)<p>There will always be people that are more intelligent or more successful, and so on. No matter how hard any of us try, there will always be something more to attain and, truly, if you wished to feel superior to your peers then Hacker News would not be the best place to be. Other than at a few elite universities and companies it is difficult to find people as intelligent, refined and ambitious as those found here. (This is not a bad thing! Being around these kinds of people lifts you up.)<p>I am not saying 'give up on trying to attain', and the advice which has been given by many  in this thread on how to do so or how to free yourself from tedium is brilliant. But remember that life is not a journey in which the only thing important is moving-up and getting to the 'end'. There is not going to be a top to the ladder you're climbing, and the only 'end' is when you die. [1]<p>As for: gaining confidence in your abilities, feeling better about yourself, having a better thought process, and overcoming whatever real or perceived obstacles you feel lie in your way; my suggestions are that you:<p>a. Stop considering your life as a giant examination in which you must constantly seek ways of evaluating yourself. Make your life about finding the people and projects that truly engage you and bring you happiness.<p>b. Consider life a learning experience: embrace change [2]; embrace failure as a neccessity; embrace as much as you can: whatever you do, remember that this might be the last time that you do it. [3] The experience that you get from your life is all you have: make the most of it.<p>c. Do not let others approval dictate how you feel you must live your life; know this: the choices you make today will create the person that you are tomorrow. Be happy with who and where you are now. You are the result of the convictions and hard work you had yesterday. Take responsibility and find happiness within yourself.<p>Anyway, hopefully that perspective helps you find a more pleasing direction to your life.<p>Good luck! :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbvKrH-GC4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbvKrH-GC4</a><p>[2] I actually live in London myself, and I am sure there are startup companies around that would be interested in someone like you if you wanted to get a job here.

Who exactly is being hurt by the ""filter bubble""?<p>The end user is fine - they are more likely to see results they are actually interested in. If a user doesn't trust a source and won't click on their links, they'll soon not have to bother scrolling past them.<p>The sites themselves actually benefit as well. Sure, they may be bumped from the first page of results for users that are unlikely to visit their site, anyway, but the tradeoff is that they get a higher position for the users who may actually visit their site. It's an ideal trade for those being filtered.<p>I suppose that leaves the idea that the end result is a ""biased"" internet. I don't buy it. Google is not removing sites that disagree with them, they are re-ordering them for different users. If your profile wasn't factored in, then what options do they have?<p>They could order on popularity, but biasing towards popular opinion isn't any better than biasing towards my opinion.<p>They could randomize the order, this would be without bias, but absolutely useless to anyone.<p>They could judge the objective truth of sites, but that's far more biased than any of the other options.",1308588518

By this I mean stuff like not having to go through the whole file to generate a zoomed view of it, etc. Of course this is just an assumption based on the fact Paint.NET isn't in the same class of application as Photoshop, so I wouldn't expect handling massive files to be a priority to the authors.

That old cliche 'nothing is totally secure' is almost right: the reality is, everything is mostly-not secure.<p>Tips on never getting caught with your pants down by a 3rd party service:<p>1. Never ever rely on a service maintained by a 3rd party to remain secure. Just assume they will be compromised in the near future (including your password).<p>2. Make your password strong but don't reuse it; save it in your browser password cache or keyring. Use a memorized really-freaking-difficult master password for the browser cache/keyring.<p>3. Use NoScript and updated browsers to help prevent XSS and other simple attacks from compromising your cached cookies.<p>4. Encrypt all sensitive stored information yourself using a well-vetted tool such as gpg, openssl, etc and store the encrypted files on the 3rd party service.<p>5. Keep hard copies of your secure files, keys, etc in a secure location. 'The Cloud' is not a backup, it's a trap.",1308587583

At that point that government will start looking like a really bad deal.<p>If this government wants to survive this coming era, it will not do what's feared. If it does do the sort of crackdowns people are fearing, it will not survive. Either it will be broken outright by the hackers and those who still care about freedom or it will fair to accomplish security and be broken by the people that still aren't safe.<p>The best chance is to actually address the issues by developing better technology in dialogue with the hackers and the security minded.

""Cross-platform"" can mean lots of different things.<p>We had a native app developed in Android. When we decided to create an iOS version, we selected Appcelerator after reviewing a few different options and seeing what we perceived to be good adoption of Appcelerator (and after talking to another firm that chose the same thing). And, we (mistakenly) thought that it's ""generating native code"", so, if anything goes wrong, we can always debug in the Objective-C. Right?<p>Wrong.<p>About 6 weeks into the development process, we were doing a round of testing to get a version out to Beta testers and found that we simply couldn't debug the code and get it to 100% stable. That's when we dug deeper (yes, a bit late for that...) and found that Appcelerator is essentially a VM running on top of the native stack. So crashes get logged to the same few lines of Appcelerator interpreter code--which is pretty much useless for debugging. For prototyping, it's great, but for production quality code, I would say stay away.<p>Shortly before we finalized this decision, we reached back out to the other firm whom we had originally spoken to before making the Appcelerator decision. They told us that they were in the same spot and had just made the decision to move off Appcelerator a couple days previous--for the same reason: stability and lag issues and no way to get to zero defects.<p>We moved to native Objective-C and the dev team is much happier. Crashes have full stack traces and we can identify exactly what to fix.<p>We got some benefit out of Appcelerator because the second round of development took less time, but given the choice (and knowing that we weren't just prototyping--we had a native Android app and we were generally happy with the screen flows) we would have gone native to begin with.",1308586148

Google is, and always has been, a filter.<p>If I type in ""Barack Obama"", it will not show me links about The Green Bay Packers NFL team.  This is not because Google is conspiring to keep me from reading about the Green Bay Packers.  It is because it is most likely that I am not looking for Packers links and will not click.  The general idea is that Google starts with every single piece of content on the internet and filters to get the content it thinks I am looking for.<p>Now, this article complains that Google is flawed because it will more likely show some MSNBC over Fox News, or vice versa.  The implication here is that <i>you never click on Fox News when it is presented</i>.  Because if you did click on Fox News and its ilk from time to time, Google wouldn't start filtering it in the first place.

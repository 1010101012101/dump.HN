""But you enjoyed the evite, right? That was an ACTUAL picture of my pants."")?<p>In all seriousness, however, I'm a big fan of Facebook event creator. And as most of my friends are on Facebook, it saves me a lot of time and hassle to try to figure out everyone's phone number/address/email--just type in approximately the first four letters of their name, select them from the now extremely narrowed down list of friends with those four letters in their name, and tada! You have just completed what used to be several hours worth of work.<p>Now if only we could get our parents and distant relatives on, so we don't have to send all those wedding invitations by mail.",1207788907

159407,comment,158939,159389,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think this is really the wrong way to think about blogs in the context of your startup.  Sure, you could make yet another useless blog to brag about your startup...or you could make a blog that provides useful information in your field, thus proving your expertise and spreading around good will that's bound to come back your way.  You obviously shouldn't create another useless blog about your product, and no one is suggesting you should (at least, I hope no one here at news.YC is).<p>Wufoo gets a significant portion of their traffic from their (excellent) blog.  37signals got pretty much all of their initial uptake from people who read their blog.  Not because they talk about how awesome their product is...but because they help people learn new things, solve problems, and enjoy their time on the web a little more.<p>If you want to call a blog a ""PR firm"", that's fine.  Most of us are doing our own PR, as well, and if blogging fits into that line item on your budget, that's fine.  The OP wants to take advantage of blogs without blogging, and people are telling him that it doesn't work that way.  Nothing you've said counters that advice.",1207788859

159402,comment,159335,159335,0,0,iamwil,,,"I hear this sentiment about eVite alot.  I personally hate that they don't put the contact info in the email for me either, and people keep using it to send me invites.  And their iCal import is provided only as a file, doesn't hook in to google calendar, 30 boxes, etc.<p>That said, lots of people have tried (and failed) to topple eVite.  Maybe people keep using it because it caters to people that send out invites, and not to people receiving them--and there in lies the dissonance.<p>The only thing I've seen that circumvents eVite is facebook's own event inviter.<p>Anyone have a good strategy to topple eVite?  (I'm not in the invitation business)  It'd be an interesting thought experiment.",1207788564

159395,comment,158831,159329,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It could very well be a bit of a situation where, ""We don't offer a scaling solution, so customers that need to scale don't come our way, so we don't hear from customers that they need to scale.""<p>But, it's worth noting that my previous (now defunct) company was entirely devoted to web performance and scalability.  It's not a volume business--the folks who need it spend a lot on the problem, but their just aren't that many who need the extreme solutions.  I've often chuckled when the few Virtualmin customers who do want scalability have explained their requirements and they match to a great degree the products I was building five years ago (and found to be a niche that wasn't worth continuing to expend effort on).  If I thought it would be profitable to pursue, I could certainly revive some of those products in the context of Virtualmin...but I think there are far more profitable areas for us to work on.<p>Everything related to the web is growing, so all ships are rising, including scalability issues...but I believe several others are rising much faster.",1207787555

A checklist gives you a bunch of tests that you can quickly run to see if the developers were paying attention to XSS issues or not.  You can decide whether or not to use the library based on the results.<p>Spez said recently that over half of Reddit's XSS issues were caused by Markdown.  It's not unusual for websites to require 3rd-party forums or comment engines or skinning systems, too.",1207787026

I think the primary concern is that typing speed simply isn't the bottleneck for most users.

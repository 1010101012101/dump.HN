If I want to endorse my likes for real, and actually want people to hear about this great product or this great mission on FB, I would have just make a bunch of status update myself.<p>But FB seems to think differently: let me take care of that for you. Instead of the user (me, I) doing all the selective publishing to tell my friends what a great product I think foobar is offering, FB will automate that process and put it in my friend&#x27;s newsfeed and sidebar regularly when that product/group is on some ad campaign. In essence, I think FB is doing too much on behalf of the user since &quot;endorsement&quot; is a serious legal matter. Not entirely a bad thing.

I&#x27;ve had periods when I&#x27;d stay awake at night because it would scare the hell out of me. Lonely people will inevitably start questioning themselves. They&#x27;ll start thinking that something is wrong with them. They&#x27;ll start ripping chunks out of their soul. Eventually the confidence diminishes and things go downhill from here.<p>I said earlier i am a loner by definition. However, I don&#x27;t consider myself one. A few years ago I decided to change things. I pushed myself to do something outside of my comfort zone. In an attempt to lift my confidence I decided to fly out to France and walk all the way across Spain to the Atlantic coast on the trail of El Camino de Santiago. After a little over a month of walking in all kinds of ungodly conditions with nothing but a backpack full of essentials and meeting and hearing amazing people and their stories, i came back with an entirely different outlook on life. I came back with my life priorities figured out. I stopped worrying about life. But most important of all, i gained my confidence back and i knew that no matter where i am tomorrow - i will be okay. As a result of all this, i started traveling more and soaking in as much of the world around me as i could. I decided to live healthy and entirely transformed my body. Recently, I picked up paragliding and I&#x27;m now working on a paraglider pilot license and hopefully start flying solo this summer. I wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed about any of this a few years back.<p>Alone? Fuck alone! Look at the world around you!!

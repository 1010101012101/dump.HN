A lot of other people with a similar level of education were in the same right place / right time situation as Gates and Jobs were back in the day, but many of them (particularly in large corporations) failed to recognize the opportunity even when it was poking them in the eye.<p>And on that note, unless one is superstitious, &quot;luck&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;random or unpredictable variables favorably aligning with your goals&quot;. If it&#x27;s coin-flip-like random, then there&#x27;s nothing you can do to foresee it or influence it. But in technology and business, many things are <i>not</i> like that. The fact that you cannot predict something usually means you have insufficient information (even for a coin flip, if you knew the exact force vector your thumb imparted on the coin, you can in fact predict the outcome). Or, more likely in the case of startups, the information is already available, but you fail to recognize its significance because it&#x27;s buried in an avalanche of information.",1389329886

Another source claims Release 8 requires the UMTS AKA (authentication and key agreement) procedure to support AES and no encryption options as well.<p>But is SNOW better than KASUMI aka A5/3? Why not just use AES? When I see non-standard and untested encryption algorithms, I think of the NSA and GCHQ. In any event, that&#x27;s why I want E-ULTRA (the LTE communications protocol) implemented in GNU Radio: to disable SNOW 3G and null ciphers.<p>I should also note that, from what I can tell, in GSM/LTE all keys (including that for the link between the cell and the tower) are (statically/algorithmically) derived from the symmetric private key shared between the SIM and the service provider&#x27;s Home Subscriber Server. Which, if I understand correctly, means it would be trivial to decrypt any surreptitiously intercepted but encrypted communications by using a NSL or subpoena to obtain those keys from the service provider <i>or</i> the access provider (assuming it wasn&#x27;t already lawfully intercepted by the access provider of course). I assume that also holds true for any Joe Blow with subpoena power and the ear of a sympathetic judge (think &quot;Doe subpoena&quot;). So make sure your <i>service</i> is from a company located in an unfriendly nation, even if your <i>access</i> already is!<p>But if they would have just used (ephemeral) Diffie-Hellman for the cell-to-tower communications, they couldn&#x27;t do that.

I need no lessons in Bitcoin from you, I hold them and actively trade them, you don&#x27;t know anything about them I don&#x27;t already know.<p>A strange comment.  I read a lot on the history of monetary systems and currencies, and I&#x27;m yet to come across an instance where widespread inflation (and a severe decline in economic activity and living standards) wasn&#x27;t caused by a ruler or a government deciding to debase a currency to either fight a war or an attempt to fix mistakes they had already made with public spending.  That was true 2,000 years ago, it&#x27;s been true in most centuries since, and it&#x27;s certainly true now.  It would take a particularly odd view of history to conclude that rulers and governments manipulate currencies to help out their citizens, rather than to appropriate from them.<p>Note that I am interested in Bitcoin precisely because of this history, because it represents something genuinely new.",1389327013

Ignoring the third of the world without electricity. So the singularity is the nerd way of saying, ""in the future, being rich and white will be even more awesome"". It's flying car bullshit: surely the world will conform to our speculative fiction. Surely we're the ones who will get to live in the future. It gives spiritual significance to technology developed primarily for entertainment or warfare, and gives nerds something to obsess over that isn't the crushing vacuousness of their lives.""<p>Although in my mind that's more of a criticism of the adulation of the Singularity by its adherents than of the actual Singularity itself.",1355338712

What of a contemporary web app is impossible to degrade?</i><p>I think there are two major downsides.<p>Firstly, there is the opportunity cost. Any time and money I spend catering to a niche group who choose not to support modern technologies properly is time and money I didn't spend improving the experience for everyone else.<p>Secondly, a lot of web apps are about convenience or entertainment. Beyond a certain point, a degraded experience isn't quantitatively worse, it's qualitatively worse, possibly even to the point of effectively making the entire service worthless.<p><i>As far as penetration of these plugins go, a comparison of Google Analytics numbers with raw logfile analysis makes that very clear.</i><p>Yes it does. Having done that analysis for the businesses I run, the people blocking Analytics specifically are a small but noticeable minority, but the people blocking JavaScript entirely are noise, and quiet noise at that.<p>Based on that data, when it comes to so-called graceful degradation, we are far more interested in supporting the significant minority of visitors who have older versions of IE that don't support things like HTML5 and CSS3 well than we are in supporting those who nerf a perfectly good modern browser.

That is the exact opposite of reality.  With the ""cloud"" route, you are limited to absurdly inadequate servers, which is a large part of what drove the ""nosql"" fad, you need to shard if you are on EC2, because they offered nothing with reasonable IO.  Even now they have an SSD option, but it is a single crappy SSD, and barely any RAM.

Plutonium has numerous allotropes, and the allotropes have different material properties such as hardness and density. Given that creating super-criticality in a fission weapon is highly dependent on density and that the implosion dynamics are dependent on the properties of the fissile material this has a significant impact on weapons design. Given that an allotrope of Plutonium can change into another over time this makes keeping an eye on Plutonium based nuclear warheads quite necessary.<p>Additionally, radioactive decay releases Helium gas (alpha particles) over time which will lodge in the crystalline structure and cause disruptions over time.<p>Either of these factors can result in a change in the reliability and yield of nuclear warheads kept in storage for a long period of time.",1355338327

This makes creating a self-sustaining magnetically confined fusion reaction more difficult but it also makes building a fusion reactor slightly challenging. But far from impossible. Neutrons can penetrate fairly deeply through many materials but fortunately ordinary water serves as a robust shield.

4911541,comment,4909942,4911264,1,0,mjn,,,"The bigger problem is verifiability via citations to third-party sources, not really notability. If you can cite a good reference, in some kind of scholarly or otherwise decent source, and not written by the actual subject of the article, it typically stays in. I've written articles on some <i>very</i> obscure things, but they were well-cited, so nobody challenged them. My usual methodology is actually to start from a good source: pick up a book like Knuth's TAOCP, find algorithms he discusses that have no article, do a little searching to find a 2nd or 3rd source on the algorithm, then write a little article cited to those 2-3 sources. Haven't run into any problems doing things that way.<p>There didn't used to be as much emphasis on citations, but a mixture of hoaxes, libel controversies, and an influx of fringe-physics people led to a significant clampdown on unverified material around 2005-06. The good side of it is that the previous focus on notability is mostly gone: if you have good sources, it's ipso-facto notable, due to having, in fact, been noted in good sources. This is quite nice when I write articles on obscure subjects which will get only a handful of visits, but which are well-referenced. The downside is that subjects which are notable <i>but</i> for which there isn't good material to cite end up in an awkward place.

I think you are seeing in the wrong way, Newspapers are getting less and less influential as time goes by, who wants to read news from yesterday? So, the best move is to leverage the actual authority WaPo has, and give them more relevance in the actual world.",1375797576

I see the final encrypted message size is 500 bytes.<p>Then, I redo the experiment, but this time, I append the string &quot;cschmidt@example.com&quot; to the message.  The final encrypted message size is now 480 bytes.  The string I injected was the same size, but the compression worked better this time, and I can guess it&#x27;s because the string I picked is redundant with something in your plaintext.<p>Mix in a bunch of complicated math and a bit of javascript, and you&#x27;ve got an exploit.<p>This threat isn&#x27;t specific to Django: it&#x27;s being billed as a TLS attack, but any encryption system that uses compression the same way is vulnerable.",1375797516

6166564,comment,6166113,6166384,11,0,vortmeester,,,"It&#x27;s true that increasing trail and rake both increase stability. But curiously, a bicycle can be made stable with both negative rake and negative trail.<p>An interesting take on this, with both mathematical modeling and real prototypes, can be found at [1]. Note also that gyroscopic stabilization is not necessary: in the prototypes, a counter-rotating extra wheel cancels out the angular momentum of the front wheel.<p>According to the authors, it&#x27;s not yet even proven that a stable bicycle must turn towards a fall. Almost the only sure thing, so far, is that &quot;at least one factor coupling lean to steer must be present&quot;. We know a lot of sufficient conditions for stability, but not what is necessary.<p>The conclusion of the paper: &quot;As a rule, we have found that almost any self-stable bicycle can be made unstable by misadjusting only the trail, or only the front wheel gyro, or only the front-assembly center-of-mass position. Conversely, many unstable bicycles can be made stable by appropriately adjusting any one of these three design variables, sometimes in an unusual way. These results hint that the evolutionary, and generally incremental, process that has led to common present bicycle designs might not yet have explored potentially useful regions in design space.&quot;<p>EDIT: here&#x27;s a not-paywalled version of the paper linked in the submitted article.<p>[1] PDF link: <a href=""https://scholar.vt.edu/access/content/group/141943de-4222-4681-8e93-07454e806e01/Podcasts/kooijman-meijaard-papadopoulos-ruina-schwab-2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.vt.edu/access/content/group/141943de-4222-46...</a>",1375797367

For example with OpenSSH you can authenticate with a preshared key and challenge response or with PAM integration, or with a regular unix password. It also supports several types of encryption. All these things are useful but requires more code.<p>Some people would argue that a very simple daemon with fewer features might be more secure because it has less attack area. For example Colin Percival of Tarsnap created spiped which essentially replaces &#x27;ssh -L&#x27;. It only supports shared key authentication and AES-256 and consists of only about 4000 lines.

Decreasing rake angle is the primary way of making a motorcycle turn faster, with the known risk that it makes it more likely to head shake or even tank-slap.<p>It&#x27;s fairly clear that common two-wheelers are stabilized by the rake and trail inducing a counter-steering effect when pushed horizontally - try to shove over a bicycle and the front of the front wheel will turn in the direction of the push because the point of contact of the tyre with the ground is behind its axis of rotation (the amount of which is the trail). And if the bicycle is moving forwards, this turn of the wheel will cause a torquing effect to roll the bike in the opposite direction of the shove. So long as the correction is somewhat less than the overall shove, the system should be self-damping.<p>But if the dynamics were fully understood, we&#x27;d be less likely to get motorcycles with issues like the well-known Pan Weave[1] and other high speed stability issues. At the limit, things like aerodynamics, chassis rigidity etc. start coming into the equation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_ST1300#Pan_weave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_ST1300#Pan_weave</a>",1375795389

Connecting the windmill to an engine is much more useful, and after a while all the movement will get transformed into heat, but the process is still is global warming neutral.

I built a very location-specific wardrobe recently[1] that has a pretty unusual design, and would have loved to have a library of similar stuff somewhere that I could grab ideas and subassemblies from. In this case, all components except the custom-printed ones are straight from the hardware store, anyone who feels like it can build it, and it costs less and performs better (given the unusual location) than anything you can buy. It&#x27;s exactly what I would want OSHW to be. I&#x27;ll be happy to scan in and share my design sketch for it and the BOM if anyone is interested. It&#x27;s technically GPL licensed because the rollers are derived from a GPL-licensed 3d printer extruder design, but I can&#x27;t very easily distribute the resulting product.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/HLbWF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/HLbWF</a>",1375794685

There are close to zero cases where someone can legitimately justify such an exercise.<p>In any case, your benchmark is flawed (as virtually all benchmarks are). The reason Go <i>the client</i> is slower is because it tries to pervasively &quot;thread&quot; via the M:N scheduler -- every wait check causes it to yield the actual thread and switch goroutine, creating a large amount of overhead. The Scala cases, on the other hand, is dramatically more limited and will not yield this overhead.<p>The Go server does not have this fault, and is likely top performance. And aren&#x27;t we talking about a server anyways?<p>Now as to the client, while we could naively criticize M:N scheduling based upon this, try giving it a more realistic workload (unless you seriously plan on load balancing pongs): Instead of ping/pong, return larger lengths of data preferably over actual network connections (not localhost) -  e.g. 32KB.<p>The Go client will catch up if not shoot into the lead. M:N scheduling is optimal for most real-world workloads, though it is less optimal for spin-off-a-million-goroutines that do nothing type tests.<p>This is not a test of TCP overhead, or a realistic test, but instead demonstrates the small overhead of goroutines when you give each a minuscule amount of wait work.",1375794132

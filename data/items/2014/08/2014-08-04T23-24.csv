8134766,comment,8133835,8134045,4,0,Daishiman,,,"When I look at SQL through the lenses of hindsight I see a language that&#x27;s not amenable to IDEs (it&#x27;s harder to autocomplete columns if you must write those before the table name, as an example), and has questionable and verbose syntax.<p>While straight relational algebra is actually quite readable, despite all the efforts of most the anti-ORM crowd, at the end of the day the business logic that works on business objects is <i>much</i> more important than the storage backend, and thinking in terms of objects seems to be the preferred alternative when reasoning in that context.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing backend logic for quite a while now, and I have to say that the special features RDBMs offer are great for reporting, but reporting is a very, very small part of what most code that interacts with the business domain does. And while that may be because SQL is <i>great</i> at aggregating data, the fact that it can&#x27;t easily be plugged with the rest of my business logic is a huge impediment.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if my entire business logic were to reside in the database, but real world applications interact with external APIs, regular files, and a whole other bunch of stuff. So the fact that ORMs speak the language of my business logic is a far greater advantage.<p>I also find the argument of inefficiency to be a strawman. Well-written ORMs are quite explicit (and lazy) about what they&#x27;re doing, and standard best practices would dictate that you should be properly describing the scopes and fields you&#x27;re fetching when your rows become wide enough. But SQL demands that too; you can trivially fetch * from a table. And SQL&#x27;s limitations mean that you don&#x27;t have access to all the sweet abbreviations ORMs provide such as scopes, custom query managers, aliases, built-in result caches, and being able to avoid the worst cases of vendor-specific SQL.<p>I started using ORMs because I was tired of writing the same SELECT statement with 10 slight variations, stored in a source file for a different language, having to deal with row casting, and being unable to plug in simple code to fetch related entities. SQL thus far has not advanced <i>one bit</i> in this area, and until someone comes up with a way to modularize the language so it can provide those features, purists will still complain while most of us keep using ORMs to avoid verbosity, bugs, and compatiblity problems.",1407196583

8134764,comment,8134323,8134713,8,0,aetherson,,,"Well, maybe.  Nothing Kim is doing is going to directly lessen demand for medallions from the city.  In San Francisco, to own a medallion, you must work 800 hours per year as a taxi driver (source: <a href=""http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/07/is-san-francisco-taxi-medallion-good.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/07/is-san-francisc...</a>).  So Kim himself is not a medallion holder at all.<p>(I gather that in other cities, this is a whole different story.  But in SF, in theory as well as as far as I can tell in practice, medallion holders are themselves pretty committed cab drivers).<p>What Kim owns are the cars and the infrastructure to support the cars, plus a dispatching system.  He rents the medallions from their owners, who drive his cars and also allow their medallions to be used by other drivers in the DeSoto fleet when their owners are not using them (this is legal, to be clear).<p>So in the short term, if Kim goes to a livery service, those medallion owners will by-and-large just rent their medallions to other taxi fleets in the city.  The city won&#x27;t lose any business directly from Kim, because he&#x27;s not a customer of theirs anyway, and in the short term, as the article states, they have a waiting list of cabbies who want to buy medallions.<p>Now, it is true that fleet owners all over the city are reporting that they are having more and more trouble getting their cars to full utilization, as the profits from being a taxi driver decrease.  And presumably at some point if current trends continue, there won&#x27;t be people willing to throw down $100k+ for a medallion, and the city will be hurt by that.  But that was a preexisting trend to Kim&#x27;s hypothetical movement to being a livery fleet, and if he does end up contributing to a lessened demand for medallions, he&#x27;ll be a pretty small part of the overall trend, which is mainly a result of Uber and Lyft undercutting taxis.<p>Source and disclaimer:  I work for Flywheel, mentioned in the original article.",1407196568

8134746,comment,8134165,8134214,4,0,keithwarren,,,"I have come to the conclusion that people A) this sentiment is an edge case and B) people will never be happy.<p>The last time there was a thread about Xamarin on here the top comment was complaining about the cost of a license, several weeks later they announce monthly pricing.<p>Now the complaint is we don&#x27;t get Visual Studio support with indie pricing. Seriously folks? I am not trying to be a Xamarin apologist but the company has to make money and find a model somewhere that makes sense - putting VS support in an up-level SKU makes all the sense in the world if you follow the trends.<p>Look at it this way, the majority of Xamarin customers who want Visual Studio support are businesses for whom the cost of the licenses is irrelevant in the larger picture (I dont want to provide a math lesson but if they x-plat savings are manifest, the ROI on the licenses is near immediate). That is where Xamarin can find the margin to support the lower tiers. If they had the ability to support the entire company on $25/developer/year then I venture they would because there is value for them right now not in taking profit but in growing the developer base. Alas they are not doing that which tells me they are finding customers in the enterprise more than willing to pay for their product. In order to get TRIPLE the revenue per customer they add one specific sweet spot that they know nearly all those customers want - Visual Studio support. If they put that in the lower tiers they nuke their margins because it is the feature that matters most to the enterprise dev teams who are often filled with people who know and enjoy visual studio above other environments. It also enables them to not purchase a secon machine (mac) for each of these developers which gets beyond the hardware and licensing costs and has an effective cost on IT operations.<p>So yes, it would be nice if Visual Studio support were included in the indie tier - but it would not be prudent. Besides, how many &#x27;indie&#x27; developers do you know are actually completely dependent on Visual Studio? I love Visual Studio and half my consulting revenue comes from the hours I spend in it - but the other half of my time which is usually spent doing mobile development is done in Xamarin Studio because - surprise, it is really pretty good.",1407196242

So my class might be something like:<p><pre><code>  # Example is Ruby+ActiveRecord but concepts should be applicable elsewhere\n  class SomeClass < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n    def some_simple_method_that_uses_activerecord\n      SomeClass.where(foo: bar).order(:baz)\n    end \n\n    ...\n\n    def some_method_that_needs_sql_magic\n      SomeClass.find_by_sql &quot;select a,b,c,d,foo,baz from some_crazy_view_or_table&quot;\n    end \n    \n  end\n</code></pre>\nThis has been working pretty well. For the simple CRUD stuff that ActiveRecord is good at, I use ActiveRecord&#x27;s built-in query interface. For the other stuff, it&#x27;s easy to write a SQL view/function and simply reference that. It&#x27;s not <i>perfect</i> because obviously you risk having too much of your app logic live in the database layer... although, then again, I feel equally icky about having too much of the data logic live in the app layer.",1407195822

For one project I&#x27;m currently using an ORM (NHibernate) with several patterns depending on the requirements and the context:<p>- With single-table queries and simple joins, having a repository available means that these are a joy to write and maintain with LINQ. And with some preparation the mappings can prevent all sorts of runtime issues.<p>- Complicated queries which might be tricky to generate optimized SQL for can be written in HQL, meaning that the data access code does not have to be coupled to one brand of persistence store.<p>- Really quirky stuff that only works in Oracle, for example, can be written raw with CreateSQLQuery(). Here the ORM is basically functioning as an extremely bloated DB session manager, but this is not very often.<p>I definitely agree that familiarity with the database query language is needed to build non-trivial applications, but at the same time I would not enjoy building many of those applications without the option to query a table in one line of type-safe code. Some folks might say that I&#x27;m not using all the features of the ORM unless I have every single foreign key relationship mapped out to lazy-loaded collections and such, but I&#x27;m not really comfortable enough with the technology to want to do that, and I don&#x27;t really mind the extra bit of housekeeping required to handle those cases.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you must prioritize raw performance or need all the flexibility of your query language, the right decision might be to ditch your ORM. With my current project, stability and maintainability are much more important, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with the convenient tools for now.",1407195026

This is mostly due to the facts that in the US everybody is driving about the same speed; in Germany, as mentioned above, if you want to drive faster than the trucks but not fast enough to stay always left, you are constantly switching lanes to overtake people in the second lane. If you want to drive a speed that is lower than the &#x27;general&#x27; second lane speed, you even need to go in and out from the truck-lane.<p>Furthermore, since it is OK to overtake on the right in the US you don&#x27;t need to change lanes if your lane now goes a little faster than the lane on the left. Even though you shouldn&#x27;t stay left for a prolonged time if you are [much] slower than the rest (even in the US), it is OK to be overtaken on the right.<p>Though, I am faster on German freeways (driving around 160-170km/h), I enjoy driving in the US more as it is generally more relaxed.<p>I somewhat doubt that the German autobahn rules are better with dealing with medium-high-traffic situations than US rules.

Even then, we use memcache for &quot;simple&quot; data structures and when we need more complex data structures, will use Redis.<p>Redis is great if you need some kind of persistence as well (and it&#x27;s fairly tunable), where as memcache and varnish, are completely in memory (varnish 4.0 I believe is introducing persistence). So you kick the process, and that&#x27;s all she wrote for your cache until it gets warm again. (Which has its own challenges).<p>Varnish also gives you a language called VCL to play around with to maximize your caching strategies and optimize the way varnish should be storing things. It&#x27;s got an easy API to purge content, when you need to purge it and it should support compression for your pages out of the box without too much tuning.<p>If you&#x27;re having issues just speeding up static content, give varnish a whirl. Spend some time with it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.<p>I believe you can also look into using nginx as a caching alternative to cache responses, but I don&#x27;t have too much experience with that.

This is true.  For example, we manage lists of former users that should not exist on systems, this gets quite slow.  I think that the slowness is mostly due to SSH, but it could be smarter about bulk operations, I suppose.<p>- Custom DSL looping and conditionals.  This was intended to make the system simpler and easier, but I agree with the author that I also have to revisit the documentation since looping in a template (jinja) is different than looping in a task (with_ directives).<p>- Task variable registration opacity.  Yup, lots of debug: actions.<p>People in IRC are pretty friendly, but I did get a tone of &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&quot;  This is exemplified, I think, by the author&#x27;s &quot;global ignore_errors&quot; feature request.  I made a suggestion that ansible-playbook should be able to run a role without having to create a stub playbook that calls the role.  I ended up creating a bash script for it, but the response on IRC was in the vein of: I don&#x27;t use it that way, you are doing it wrong.  To me, Ansible is another tool in my sysadmin chest, I am going to use it in the way that works best for me.  It&#x27;s nice if the tool supports my workflow.<p>The remarks about the friendliness of the Salt community are enough to get me to take another look... Oh, and also that Salt released its webUI (Halite) to the community, but Ansible&#x27;s AnsibleWorks is closed.

This is practical and will save lives, and the evidence supports this.&quot;<p>If I&#x27;m reading you correctly, I have a number of problems with it:<p>1.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in any way practical to re-engineer roads on the massive scale that would be necessary to do this.  If, as asserted, the majority of people exceed the speed limits the majority of the time, you&#x27;re talking about re-engineering the majority of roads.  That&#x27;s an enormous project compared to resetting the speed limits.<p>2.  You&#x27;re a bit light on details about what you would do to make people obey the speed limits, but you list as contributing to speeding &quot;wide lanes, big setbacks, and homogenous environments.&quot;  Leaving aside homogenous environments (are we now talking about re-engineering not only all of our roads, but also all of our cities in general?), I&#x27;m sure that making lanes narrower and setbacks smaller would in fact make people drive slower, but would it actually increase safety compared to the counterfactual of not re-engineering and increasing speed limits?  I doubt it.  Certainly, I don&#x27;t see evidence for it.<p>3.  Hidden in here is a question of legitimacy.  Are current speed limits a result of a social consensus about the speed/safety tradeoff made by an open society?  I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s any convincing evidence that they are.  They appear to be a reaction to OPEC and a revenue model for local governments at least as much as they are about a democratic consensus -- and to the extent that they are about a democratic consensus, they seem to be based on one in which the democracy in general was not aware of the deleterious effects of low speed limits in terms of speed differentials.<p>So, look, the situation right now appears to be:<p>a.  Roads designed for speed, but with artificially low speed limits leading to inflated danger.<p>And a couple of possible future policies could be:<p>b.  Roads designed for speed, with higher speed limits leading to reduced danger compared to a.<p>c.  Roads designed for lower speed, with the same or lower speed limits leading to reduced danger compared to either a. or b.<p>It seems like you&#x27;ve jumped to the conclusion that option c is the right one, but I don&#x27;t know that it is, even granted that it is the safest option.",1407193560

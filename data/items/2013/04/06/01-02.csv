5502293,comment,5501423,5501637,3,0,kstenerud,,,"> App should just save automatically.<p>Oh god please no. Apps that save automatically are the worst idea ever. I want to be able to make exploratory modifications, and then commit to disk AT A TIME OF MY CHOOSING. The computer doesn't know what I'm thinking, and it can't tell the difference between ""messing around"" content vs ""serious"" content.<p>I can see it now: I hit undo a bunch of times to get back to a previous state, copy some content that I wanted to bring back, then redo a bunch of times to get back, except I fatfinger it and hit paste by mistake. Now my whole redo path is gone, and I can't even reload to the state I was at before hitting undo thanks to the braindead program that ""helpfully"" saved my document behind my back.<p>Or even worse: I make some exploratory changes, then decide after changing a LOT of things that it won't work. The app crashes/the computer dies, whatever. I reopen the app and it's saved all the changes I don't want anymore. Maybe if I'm lucky it would have saved an undo path (unlikely), but even then, how far do I have to undo to get back to the sane state I was in?<p>Save means ""I'm sure this is what I want. Persist these changes"".",1365213400

5502286,comment,5502033,5502033,6,0,dvt,,,"Most of the comments have (thus far) had quite a snotty attitude regarding the OP's very directed attempt to try and <i>get into</i> YC. I have a different opinion.<p>I don't buy the ""do whatever your passion is"" bullshit. I just don't. I think that people that win are people that WANT to win. Of course, some times you see some guy who's passion was building boats all his life (or something) and he happens to get on CNN and get some major coverage and his business booms (when he's like 60); my argument is that those are largely exceptions.<p>If you want to win, you need to focus on winning (like the OP is/was doing). Winning in the start-up world is largely contingent on two things: VC and media coverage. YC can bring both home. I see absolutely nothing wrong with OP's attempt to enhance his application (heck even ""leveraging"" a woman co-founder is fair game).<p>Here's a (somewhat poor) analogy: I have a large number of friends that go to law schools (or have already graduated). In many cases, the most ambitious ones will not even consider a sub-T14 school. If they don't get into a top law school, what's the point of paying for a degree and practicing law at some sub-par firm?<p>Of course, the romantics in us don't really appreciate this cold-hearted realism (if you really really like law, you can succeed! see Erin Brokovich!) But real life doesn't work like that. YC is, in many ways, prime real-estate for new start-ups. I see no reason why you WOULDN'T cater your application and idea to trying to get in. Heck, that's exactly what people to do when trying to get Fullbright scholarships, Ivy league acceptances, etc.",1365213267

I think I am most likely missing something here, but I've thought about this a lot and can't figure it out. Overall, I think YC and friends provide a net gain to society, encouraging entrepreneurial ideals and bringing a few really great ideas to fruition. But for the rest... I don't know.<p>This is certainly not universal, but it seems like a bunch of YC funded startups exist solely to attempt being acquired. I understand that 'exiting' is a marker of some form of success, but doesn't this notion sort of contradict some of the hacker mentality and startup culture that created it in the first place? I mean, you just poured your heart and soul into a company for the past several months, if not years, and you're just going to let some mega corporation purchase it and grow even larger?

But the same could be said for, say, the death of Steve Jobs. If we can mourn Steve Jobs for a week, we can ponder the Arrington accusations for a couple hours. In other words, using this bureaucratic justification for removing those stories, whose relevance is to the community, is inconsistent with the way HN is typically run, and thus intellectually dishonest, something that good hackers should not like.<p>In other words, censoring these stories is a form of lying.<p>I'd also like to say that while a controversy of this nature can generate a lot of <i>bad</i> discussion, it can also generate <i>good</i> discussion: I'm willing to bet it's possible for the average HN'ers to contribute in a constructive manner on a topic like this if they really want to. Or, to be more precise: one should not be afraid to discuss a controversy <i>iff</i> they can contribute to the discussion in a way that is not causal, i.e. intended to affect the outcome. That is a nice rule to keep in mind: pretend what you're saying doesn't matter before you say it.<p>Dishonesty, Kant tells us, results from using the audience to achieve your aims. So don't do that.<p>The point of the above two paragraphs is hopefully to inspire moderators not to censor future controversies, either.

In 'normal' cases, people start with a cap-based H1B (with some profit making company) and then change employment to another profit making company. Their new H1B application isn't transfered, but it's not subject to any cap as that applicant has been already counted in the cap. \nThe rule says that, ""an applicant will not be counted towards cap if he/she has been subject to cap in last 6 years"". Most cases fall under this category and hence it's commonly perceived as 'H1B transfer (without going through cap again)'.<p>If one starts with a non-profit H1B, then he/she needs to go through a cap-subject process to join a profit making company. While it's not impossible, it's extremely difficult  to find an employer who will apply for your H1B in April and wait until October 1'st (when new FY begins) for you to join the company. There is a way out here - you can start working before October if you do concurrent employment at both places, but again that's difficult to achieve (both employers should agree as well!).<p>IMO:<p><pre><code>   * the wait time from April to October should be eliminated\n   * allow work as soon as visa is approved\n</code></pre>\nThis will reduce the application rush and companies can pursue good candidates all round the year.<p>Also, keep in mind that not all H1B holders will enter US. It can be a carrot stick to curb attrition as an H1B holder employee won't switch a company in the hope of being 'on-site' some day.

We've acquired beloved game developers, we've put storied franchises to rest, and we've sheparded evolutions in gameplay and game design that have been met with skepticism and rejection.<p>But please believe, we're on the player's side.<p>Tens of thousands of EA employees show up to work every day to create incredible new experiences and polish fantastic new things that the world has never seen.<p>You, your family, and your friends entrust us with time, attention, and money in return for fantastic experiences with characters you love and places that are realer than real. It's an honor to work in this industry.<p>We love these shared stories and adventures, and truly understand what makes videogaming special to hundreds of millions of people every day.<p>That said, we are a business, and all businessess will make mistakes, fail to meet expectations, and poorly communicate. We're no different.<p>XXX EXAMPLES XXX<p>Videogames are unique in that the business environment changes more in six months than most other industries change in decades, and we've struggled to adapt to the new realities just like hundreds of other videogame developers.<p>We feel it's essential that we have an online content distribution system of our own, called Origin. It's clear that we've fallen painfully short of industry standards in terms of technical execution and customer service, and we most certainly are not meeting our own expectations.<p>XXX INSERT HONEST FIXES HERE XXX<p>We also feel that we're failing to incorporate our customer's frustrations, concerns, and desires into the development of our franchises.  When some player were disappointed with Mass Effect 3, they had nowhere to voice their opinions where they felt they would be heard.<p>Thus, as of this week we will be employing ombudsmen for each of our major franchises. They'll be superfans who know the games inside and out, and their sole responsibility will be to communicate with you about what's happening with the development and care of your favorite series and franchises.<p>FIFA - @Matthiew\nMass Effect - @Jennifer\nSIMCITY - @Alyssa<p>XXX ETCETERA XXX<p>Feel free to vent, praise, be angry, you name it. They'll be listening. But always be respectful. We're here to have a good time together.<p>Finally, we understand that server shutdowns are a necessary part of the life of any game. No party goes on forever. But we don't want to shut off the lights too early, and we don't want customers to wonder how long the game they've just purchased will be fully functional and connected.<p>So today we're instituting a 3 year server guarantee on every network-aware and network-based videogame we sell. You can purchase an EA game and rest assured that you'll have friends to go on adventures with for a long long time.<p>For what we've failed in, we are truly sorry. We strive to delight one and all, but we can never be perfect. For those who feel we can never do right, you'll find dozens of other talented studios who you can have a more fruitful relationship with.<p>We don't feel there's any shame in being #1, but we do feel there's a great responsibility in it.<p>Let us bring you the best games on Earth, tell us plainly and clearly when we're not meeting that expectation, and let's all have fun together.<p>- EA CEO WHATEVER""<p>I wrote this in literally twelve fucking minutes.

Their otherwise interesting products are made far less compelling in order to satisfy business requirements. It's just dumb business. Meet your business objectives in smarter ways while creating smarter products and people will like you more.<p>In the field of entertainment software, the user experience is paramount. There's also something to be said for letting customers feel like they ""own"" their games rather than simply leasing them until you close your servers. If you take this away, you'd damn well better provide some fantastic value in its place.

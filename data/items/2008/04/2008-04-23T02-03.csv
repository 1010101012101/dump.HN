It's a fad and it should be over soon.<p>For me, the biggest issue was making sure I had a .com to go with it. Go to instantdomainsearch.com and just start typing as things come to your mind.<p>There are other sites that automatically mash words together and check their availability, so search for these generators. There are a few generators already posted here, so be sure to check them out.",1208919562
171225,comment,170772,170882,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Some colleges encourage something similar. The Acton MBA program encourages alumni to sponsor new students so that their education is free (and based entirely on their ability to be accepted into the program). Once these students graduate, they are encouraged to turn around and to the same thing for the students behind them (out of a percentage of their earnings over the following years, until it is repaid).<p>It's not exactly the same model, but it does represent a take money now and payback out of future earnings template.The thing is A: repayment is encouraged, but not required, and B: the amount taken out of your future earnings is fixed and will end once paid.",1208919134

171212,comment,171111,171111,0,0,dshah,,,"Although $30,000 seems like a lot to spend on a domain name, it's a much better investment than a lot of the marketing expenses that venture-backed startups spend money on.<p>The key is to have something simple, memorable, unambiguous and differentiated.  You don't have to spend $30k to get that, but at least they picked something that works.  Cheaper than hiring a high-and branding firm too.",1208917835
171211,comment,169295,170037,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think people have fewer expectations than you might assume. Most people spend too much time judging themselves when interacting to bother doing it to others. But the way you judge yourself makes you assume others are judging you, but they're not, they're focusing on themselves. If that makes any sense, which it may not.<p>I'd say work your way up to attractive women. They're the hardest for a number of reasons (you're afraid of them due to approach anxiety, they're used to approaches and are more on their guard, etc.) Start off talking to guys and less attractive females. People are always most receptive toward people who appear to be in their own demographic and social status level, so start there and work your way out.",1208917748

171209,comment,170838,170838,0,0,lux,,,"I'd lean towards the ""carrots"" myself, and there are lots of potential ones (user customizable profiles, more simultaneous games, ""pro"" games, etc).  Look at what other successful startup multiplayer game sites are doing and try some out.  With carrots, you can still offer a compelling free service but there are lots of appealing things that dedicated users will pay for.  weewar.com seems to have succeeded in this, for example (I've taken my wallet out for them in the past, just don't have time for games these days otherwise I'd still be on there).<p>I would think the key to retaining free players is the quality of the game(s) themselves, and the network effect of having enough players to play against.  Checkers probably wouldn't retain me for more than a game, but some of the others on your site seem like they might.  Scrabulous seems to be exploding on Facebook for example, while only one or two people I know play Chess... (unfortunately ;)<p>Maybe a unique game like Lost Cities from flexgames.com -- that was a neat game for a while that you can't find anywhere else...",1208917616

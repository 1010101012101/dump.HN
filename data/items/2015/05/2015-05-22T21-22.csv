9591054,comment,9587772,9590974,0,0,themeek,,,"I agree that the US was a colonialist nation leading up the 1900s. The tribal peoples of Mexico, South America and North America were not recognized as nations of their own. I know that isn&#x27;t a very satisfying distinction, but you can see the point.<p>The article on the Embargo Act itself reads: &quot;The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general Embargo that made illegal any and all exports from the United States. It was sponsored by President Thomas Jefferson and enacted by Congress. The goal was to force Britain and France to respect American rights during the Napoleonic Wars. They were engaged in a major war; the U.S. wanted to remain neutral and trade with both sides, but neither side wanted the other to have the American supplies.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly in line with the thesis.<p>Regarding Samoa and Germany/Phillipines and Spain - this is when these policies began to change. They bubbled from the late 1800s and broke in the early 1900s.<p>I think there&#x27;s a narrative difference here: the US broadly did not align themselves with other nations into treaties of peace and of war. The &quot;founding fathers&quot; specifically discussed the danger of political entanglement with other nations - the danger of allowing them to say &quot;yes&quot; and to say &quot;no&quot;.<p>I feel like your interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, of the Embargo Act and of Manifest Destiny are not charitable for these reasons. Of course the US was not &#x27;isolationist&#x27;. I termed it &#x27;non-interventionist&#x27;. Even that is not a good term, but what was meant I think is clear.<p>Yes the US engaged in colonialism and in trade. But it did not involve itself in the spirit of the top post: allowing other nations to have a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; say. It made declarations like the Monroe Doctrine. It did not make treaties like NATO or like TTIP. Categorically these are different in kind than what happened before the 1900s.<p>Part of that is due to a changing world (I say this in my top post). But the US was also under a different international political disposition.",1432331864

Calling out to the Europeans and saying &quot;Stay out of America&quot; was really Americans preemptively claiming all land West of the Mississippi River as US Territory.<p>Keeping Europeans out of &quot;The Americas&quot; was a major land grab opportunity. Which was then followed by decades of American conquest (and Native American genocide). The Monroe Doctrine, together with &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; demonstrates American ambition to form the largest country the world had ever seen at that point.<p>Our war with Mexico (which allowed us to grab and annex Texas, New Mexico, and California), and British Politics (54/40 or Fight + Various other disputes) led to the establishment of the US North and South borders. The East and West boarders expanded with basically infinite ambition, in part because of the Monroe Doctrine.<p>In any case, when we ran out of land to conquer, that&#x27;s when we started looking overseas. I think it is clear that America has always been a rather ambitious nation. Ret-conning the concept of isolationism is a mistake IMO.<p>-------------------<p>In fact, why don&#x27;t you take a look at what Mexico looked like in 1840.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralist_Republic_of_Mexico"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralist_Republic_of_Mexico</a><p>And tell me, do you think the US was &quot;isolationist&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t mettle in other nation&#x27;s affairs&quot;?

As these features change on a global scale: as rivers are redirected, water levels displace populations, as deserts expand and forests move these boundaries are shifted and so conflict can bubble between regions regarding their territory.<p>On a similar tact changes to the resource supply chain also causes territory disputes. In some places (e.g. Yemen), water shortages fuel conflict that can only get worse as water dries up. Resources move and ecological changes shift country&#x27;s resource supplies. Large changes and migrations to game or fish populations force regions to renegotiate rights to territory for hunting and fishing.<p>Furthermore climate change makes some previously unavailable resources accessible. The elephant in the room here is the Arctic, which contains roughly 20% of the world&#x27;s oil and huge amounts of minerals and other resources - as well as it being a natural and valuable geostrategic location for missile deployment and satellite communication.<p>Some months ago a new executive order was published for the purposes of developing a steering committee to unify agencies across the United States government to implement goals it describes as:<p>&quot;... critical long-term strategic, ecological, cultural, and economic value, and it is imperative that we continue to protect our national interests in the region, which include: national defense; sovereign rights and responsibilities; maritime safety; energy and economic benefits; environmental stewardship; promotion of science and research; and preservation of the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea as reflected in international law. ...&quot;<p>The steering committee is responsible for a few things, and first:<p>&quot;Sec. 3.

These interests include such matters as missile defense and early warning; deployment of sea and air systems for strategic sealift, strategic deterrence, maritime presence, and maritime security operations; and ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight.<p>The United States also has fundamental homeland security interests in preventing terrorist attacks and mitigating those criminal or hostile acts that could increase the United States vulnerability to terrorism in the Arctic region.<p>The Arctic region is primarily a maritime domain; as such, existing policies and authorities relating to maritime areas continue to apply, including those relating to law enforcement.[1] Human activity in the Arctic region is increasing and is projected to increase further in coming years. This requires the United States to assert a more active and influential national presence to protect its Arctic interests and to project sea power throughout the region.<p>The United States exercises authority in accordance with lawful claims of United States sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the Arctic region, including sovereignty within the territorial sea, sovereign rights and jurisdiction within the United States exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, and appropriate control in the United States contiguous zone.<p>Freedom of the seas is a top national priority. The Northwest Passage is a strait used for international navigation, and the Northern Sea Route includes straits used for international navigation; the regime of transit passage applies to passage through those straits.

The current resource and land distribution of the world benefits the United States - in the sense that it is uniquely able to feel secure from the imperial ambitions of its neighbors (like the Britannica that bore it it is surrounded by weak neighbors and by geographical features that protect it). It is in the US national security interests that boundaries do not shift - both because it is a garunteur of static boundaries so that shifting boundaries undermine its legitimacy, and because it opens the opportunity for nations to become regional hegemons that can &#x27;grow up&#x27; to play global power games against the US (I&#x27;m channeling the leaked DoD Wolfowitz Doctrine here).<p>The US does not want power projected or ballistic missile systems on its northern flank. In turn it enumerates &#x27;strategic deterrence&#x27; as a national security issue in the Arctic: the US feels the need to deploy its own missile systems aimed at other nations as a retaliatory measure to deter possible future hostility.<p>Finally, the global ranging security pacts of the US will force it to intervene if conflict arises nearly anywhere over this changing world. If the world erupts into territory dispute caused by geographical changes and resource contention the US is obligated to be a part of that conflict.",1432330039

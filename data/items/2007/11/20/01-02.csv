Total energy consumption will increase.<p>My point is not that climate change is unimportant.<p>My point is that carbon offsets that invest in the current generation of hopelessly expensive alternative energy approaches will NOT help the situation. <p>While you think research takes a long time, how long will a net harmful solution take to solve the problem?<p>Investing in research will help. It is the only long term solution.",1195523073
81775,comment,81652,81769,0,0,mkull,,,"It isn't weighted properly you are correct, however it is a good guideline to cover your bases.<p>I appreciate the tips, but at the moment we have pretty much all of your points covered<p>- We are currently using asset hosts (assets0..assets3.revzilla.com) (Rails provides this functionality out of the box with 2.0)<p>- All static content IS served by nginx, only the rails requests are being served by mongrel.  All static assets are also sent with the appropriate cache headers<p>- css sprites are used sparingly where appropriate, however they are not a silver bullet, and you run into cross browser issues pretty quickly (namely safari)<p>- We are working on reducing the number of images at the moment.  In general I would rather have a site which is true to the original design and then optimize from there, rather then cutting corners early on.",1195523003

81769,comment,81652,81714,0,0,nickb,,,"YSlow isn't weighted properly and offers you a false sense of security. <p>Your site, in current setup, wouldn't last very long if you had hundreds of concurrent requests since you have so many requests. You do realize that most browsers allow two concurrent downloads per IP? You should distribute all these images across many subdomains (just make up subdomains; they can all point to the same server).<p>assets1.revzilla.com, assets2.revzilla.com etc.<p>Also, why aren't you running a real server for static content?! Mongrel ain't gonna cut it. Use Mongrel for dynamic stuff (i.e. Rails pages) and use Nginx (or apache or lighttpd) for static content (css and all these images that you have).<p>Finally, google for ""css sprites"" and optimize these images.<p>PS: Site looks good but it's just horribly assembled. You should replace 90% of those images by using CSS colors.",1195521795

Are there any real interactive apps that aren't just glorified databases or passive?<p>I've been thinking that the browser sucks for interactivity (no, Javascript abuse isn't acceptable), thick client applications are too much work but something in between could be golden.<p>Thanks<p>Update: I guess games could count but aren't what I am looking for.

Most people do not want to carry around a tablet when a paperback is what they want.  All the gizmos are a waste.  <p>Also, why add dumb features like wireless?  Simplify, the ebook has a built in mp3 player, guess how many people use it?<p>The sony could be improved by upping it's resolution to 300dpi, make the screen a little bigger.  Keep the same cool form factor and remove some useless buttons.  Put a front light on it.  And remove the DRM, DRM will keep killing ebooks until publishers get a clue.<p>I also think there is room for an ereader with a 300dpi letter sized display, panasonic had really cool looking prototype.  Give me that in a sony style package with a pdf reader and I'll gladly fork over $1K for it.<p>Currently working through Guttenberg, amazing how Mickey Mouse has totally corrupted the idea of public domain.<p>",1195520942

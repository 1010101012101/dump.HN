If you haven’t heard yet, he tried to pick a fight with Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, and got the wings shot off his ego in front of the entire online world. That’s almost as bad as getting date raped by Chuck Norris on prom night. Getting to the point, Steve asked Ryan a simple question, ‘Do you create anything, or just criticize others work and belittle their motivations?’. Ryan’s response doesn’t matter to you or me. Just ask yourself that same scathing question. Are you creating something for society or just sitting on the sidelines watching? Deciding to create is more than just creating something, it’s deciding to create a higher consciousness and a greater existence.<p>Creators blaze new paths with their child-like enthusiasm, their drive to challenge existing ideas, and their dedication to quality. Don’t worry if you haven’t yet fully lived up to the creator in you yet, anyone can become a creator. In fact, every great creator you can think of was once a devout follower. How else could have learned to create on their own? Even Da Vinci started out as a follower. The process of becoming a creator requires ample time but, once you find a medium that resonates with you, the path is much less daunting and much more fulfilling. It’s never too late to look yourself in the mirror and ask; Who am I? What makes me happy? How can I help the world?<p>I had to face the music just like Steve Jobs before me and countless other dreamers of past and present. It was tough but it becomes easier every day and every step forward is emancipating. Steve found computers and went on to lead Apple through a few revolutions with the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and the iPad. What will you create and how far will you take it? Anything can be made art with enough attention to craftsmanship, that‘s the essence of creativity. Emeril is an artist of food. J.K. Rowling is an artist of words. What’s your creative outlet? It is possible to have many different ones over the years but, it‘s more important to master just one first. The greatest creators see no borders between work, play, learning, and life. It’s all one seamless endeavor in their eyes. It’s not always happy and peaceful, it can be chaotic and stressful but, just think of the long-term benefits instead of the short-term frustrations.<p>Some discover their creative reservoir during their school days and others discover during their retirement days. It’s never too early or too late. Just don’t assume you have nothing to create. You really don’t know what is inside you until you start creating it out. Maslow, the founder of humanistic psychology, called this process self-actualization and placed it at the top of his infamous Hierarchy of Needs for a reason. A sweeping self-inventory can be painful but old ideas must be abandoned for new ones to grow. Just think of the once widely accepted Earth-centric universe.<p>You really don’t want to get left behind, do you? You also don’t want to blame the creators while there is a world of knowledge, experience, and wisdom open to any who dare to create instead of follow. Imagine the possibility of creating something that connects to people, doesn’t matter if it’s one or a billion, and convinces them to start creating too. It is a magical feeling that words can’t describe. If money is on your mind, don’t worry, if you are creative and focused enough, it will just come to you. Just ask Jay-Z, who started his own label when the industry turned him down and he did all this without a college degree. Today, he is one of the most influential people in the world, not just rap music. If you are not convinced yet, just try it. Start creating today and start building a new life. The simple act of creating itself has been liberating for countless humans of past and present. Why not you?",1274244813

Also, draws are common, even when there is a clear imbalance between the skill/ability of the teams. I've heard it concluded that the reason football fans are seen to be more 'thuggish' (media hype aside) is that the game often does not satisfy the primal urge to defeat someone/something.<p>True, the 'one lucky kick' possibility also means that your team wins when it really shouldn't have.

The reason is that most people will be adding to retirement investments on a monthly basis, and if you do that with ETFs your transactional cost to buy shares will dwarf the ETF's management fees for quite some time.<p>Although if my memory from several years ago is right, Vanguard charges a sale fee for the fund equivalent of their emerging market fund, to discourage people from trading into and out of it frequently.  You can check that on their website -- it would tend to change the above result for most people here.<p>Disclosure: Upwards of 60% of my retirement accounts are ETFs, including the Vanguard ones mentioned.

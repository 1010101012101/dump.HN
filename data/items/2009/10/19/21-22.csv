Even assuming that you're using the shorthand notation to compact the properties vertically and that you're listing out each one here because they need to have different properties, grouping the related ones together (all the margins, paddings, etc) would make it much easier to scan.

From my (limited) understanding of Clojure, the implementation in the article is counting up by one at a time, thereby doing twice the work and making the even check redundant, since you could otherwise simply write:<p><pre><code>  def is_prime(i):\n      return (i > 1 and all(i % x != 0 for x in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1)))\n</code></pre>\nEdit:  The conditionals can be collapsed further, but it's starting to get silly:<p><pre><code>  def is_prime(i):\n      return (i == 2 or (i > 2 and i % 2 != 0 and all(i % x != 0 for x in range(3, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1, 2))))</code></pre>",1255989435

The ability to charge a premium also enables innovation, however.  You can charge more for your new, different thing, and if it's truly different then it probably does cost more since economies of scale aren't fully in play.  Also your new thing can be truly new and different -- this enhances the caché and lets you tap into status-seeking early adopters.<p>Apple seems to be in the space where Mercedes used to be -- able to charge a premium for well engineered and truly (though conservatively) innovative high-quality products.  The danger is in <i>too much</i> power in the marketing arm.  If the company succumbs to the temptation to sacrifice quality and innovation for better marketing, then it is done for.  If that happens, Apple will become a vacuous status symbol, and the real engineering innovation will come from someone else.  A clear and present danger!

While Apple is long touted as a company built on innovation, they can probably extract profits without any new innovations for a while. (A while being 2-3 years, doesn't mean to stop trying though.) And it's true that iPod sales decreased 8% over last year's Q3, they expected this because of increasing iPhone sales.<p>I believe while other hardware companies are racing to the bottom in prices, Apple is able to extract premium on its hardware and this is really reflected in the gross margin and bottom line.<p>Could Apple produce a 600$ laptop? Sure. But it is not worth the temporary gains they'd see. A low end line would cannibalize the margins of their other computers. The quality would probably suffer and it would hurt their brand equity. Apple could introduce an economy line of computers and take over way more of the market, probably grow their sales by 25-40% in a year. To me, that is a strong statement... in that they could but they don't.<p>I think one thing that Apple will have to contend with is the image.

We reached a level of audio quality that the majority of people are basically happy with some decades ago.  (I'm talking about amplification and transduction here.)  What ""progress"" we've made in the meantime that hasn't had to do with new formats (both in the sense of media/input format and output format) has had mostly to do with making sound amplification and transduction more <i>convenient</i>.  So big stacks of components are now tending to disappear into convenient all-in-one forms.  A very high-level diagram of this progression could be:<p><pre><code>    Innovation -> Optimization -> Standardization -> Convenience\n</code></pre>\nWith audio, standardization was instrumental in optimization.  Since one could swap-out their crappy amplifier for a better one, standardization enabled competition in audio components.  So perhaps these are better represented as happening together.<p>In the convenience phase, standardization doesn't go away.  It just becomes invisible to the end user.<p>Seen this way, it's obvious that there's a <i>lot</i> of desktop development left to do, even if OS are already seen as commodity, just like audio equipment became commodity decades ago, but still came in rather inconvenient forms.  A lot of the desktop experience is still quite far from being completely seamless.  Users still have to be aware that one program does their IMs, another does stuff on the web.  Yet another might be used to publish their blog.  Another one lets them read PDFs.  Another lets them edit their photos.  It's just like the 80s and 90s when a lot of people still had to puzzle over the manuals and plug dozens of cords to hook up the 4 or 5 components of their home theater.  (Instead of buying some all-in-one thing and just plugging in 6.  Soon, it may get to the point where no one plugs in anything at all on their home theater, except to power outlets.)",1255987195

It's only a bad idea if you're doing it wrong :) The source/conceptual tables can be normalized, while the join views can be materialized/implemented with Bigtable like sparse columns, which are dynamically updated if the joins happen a lot. Any subsequent join queries hits the views but the source tables. Manual denormalization should be allowed but not required.<p>GAE has nothing to do with this, it's a shared cluster, such that any benchmark is not reliable and comparable. It also has nothing to do with the SQL discussion, as it doesn't support joins either.",1255986130

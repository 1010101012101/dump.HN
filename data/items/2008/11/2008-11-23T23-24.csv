Barely anyone had <i>access</i> to computers then.<p>I don't know how you'd measure this, but the profiles, to me, certainly aren't broad and vague. They make very specific and very falsifiable claims about personality, and all out of a mere 4 bits of information. The first time I read my profile (ENFP) it was like a bolt of lightning shot through me. It had me to a 'T.' My <i>parents</i> couldn't describe me so well. And my experience is far from atypical.<p>There are a bunch of other major statistical discoveries about the different groups. For example, INTP's have the lowest level of emotional coping resources, while their cousins, the ENTP's, have the highest! INTJ's have the highest college GPA's, while the adjacent INTP's have much lower, scoring far below what their aptitude tests would indicate. There is a lot of real information in those few bits!<p>Sources:

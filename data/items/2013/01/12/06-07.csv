Does not really remove a tumor so much as it stops growth without having to make an incision.  Common for cranial tumors.<p>Other radiation:  Can be devastating.<p>Desirable future solution:<p>Engineer molecules that are precisely designed to affect the tumor and spare non-afflicted structures.  Perhaps this takes the form of a molecule that simply becomes a marker of sorts that some other technology (gamma knife?) can use to guide the ""attack"" with great accuracy.<p>In an ideal sci-fi world one would be able to administer a substance containing molecules that can bind to the tumor and actually dissolve it.<p>Take the example of something like an acoustic neuroma (my wife is a doctor, she suggested this example).  This is a tumor that grows within the cranial cavity and around the acoustic and facial nerves.  Mechanical removal usually means certain damage to the auditory never (causing deafness on that side) and potential damage to the facial nerve (causing that half of the face to drop and have not muscle tone).  This type of tumor is usually either cut out or stopped in it's tracks using gamma knife.  In most cases the person ends-up deaf on one side.  This means the loss of acoustically locate sound, brain-computed noise reduction and even balance problems.<p>It'd be interesting to see a molecular ""attack"" type solution that could dissolve the tumor while staying away from the brain and not impacting the nerves at all.  The treatment could also take the form of a substance that is actually injected into the tumor (rather than the entire bloodstream).<p>Don't know if this is the kind of problem that could be tackled with molecular dynamics on a supercomputer.  Even if you could, there might not be enough data available or commonality in tumorous cells to develop ""key"" molecules that could target them.",1357971376

I would recommend getting an AVR Dragon JTAG interface, being able to debug at the hardware level is invaluable when you are learning or doing ""real"" development in assembler.<p>Note that a good portion of the learning curve for AVR or other microcontroller assembler is learning the hardware environment and learning about interrupts, execution environment setup, etc etc.  None of this is particularly useful for malware analysis on x86 hardware.<p>If you are going to analyse malware under Android/etc then ARM is not such a bad idea.

The flag is set if the sprite #0 contains non-transparent pixels, and it overlaps something on the background. When the PPU hits the first pixel where those conditions are true, it sets a bit and fires an non-maskable interrupt. This way you could do once per frame scanline detection for split screen effects, but you still have to time your code correctly, as NMI handling is not clock accurate, and neither is the actual sprite #0 hit detection.<p>For more advanced effects, Nintendo developed mappers for their cartridges, calles memory management controllers, which increased cartridge memory with banking, and also added custom interrupts and features. MMC3 contained a scanline counter which makes it possible to do fun effects with NES. Megaman 3 to 6 used MMC3.<p>I'm really just a beginner with NES programming, so I hope there is no significant factual errors in that.",1357970402

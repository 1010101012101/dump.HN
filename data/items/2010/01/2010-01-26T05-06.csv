1077152,comment,1076936,1077083,0,0,crux_,,,"Sure. But this is all supposition dressed up to sound convincing. Here's some of my own, hopefully somewhat convincing as well:<p>Why can't our girls learn math? Because they are surrounded by a society where math is frightening black magic, a society which largely looks down upon anyone who is good at math, and particularly so those who specialize in it. This is emphasized for girls; the linked article provided evidence that their math abilities declined in proportion to the amount in which their teacher reflected those societal pressures.<p>Why do their teachers have math anxiety? See above.<p>Why are their teachers incompetent at math? See above. Also, <i>their</i> teachers were incompetent at math. (See the exact same referenced article.)<p>Why do schools hire teachers incompetent at math? Most of all, because math is not valued. But also: Because there aren't enough teachers available to only hire perfect ones. Because the ways of measuring ""good at math"" are quite brittle, let alone measurements for ""good at <i>teaching</i> math.""<p>----<p>In other words, you have your axe to grind (unions) and I have mine (a thoroughly anti-intellectual culture); personally I find mine rather more convincing. Neither was really directly brought up by the article.<p>[Also, my axe doesn't conveniently align with over-repeated, loudly shouted political talking points, which is nice. ;) ]",1264485118

1077126,comment,1075865,1076963,0,0,randolph_carter,,,"Also not wanting to sound like a mouthpiece, but choice of log management system is a very interesting topic to me... scalability is only one concern and may not trump everything. We actually looked at both LogLogic and Sensage during our initial evaluation both of which scaled better than Splunk did at the time. My memory of the evaluations is dim (2+ years ago), but I recall that both products seemed more brittle in our environment (education), where we have very little control over incoming log formats due to somewhat chaotic organizational structure and infrastructure. Splunk seemed more able to accept unstructured or unexpected data without complaint and to deal with the parsing at search time rather than index time, and was a more natural fit. The other decision points/tradeoffs we ended up making were a) no additional licensing cost for Splunk agents, b) prioritization of real-time perusal for troubleshooting purposes over long-term reporting and canned reports. Sensage excels at the latter since it amortizes the cost of reporting by caching periodic results, and provides a large set of prebuilt reports, if I recall correctly. Splunk's ""summary indexing"" serves sort of the same purpose as the cachign feature of Sensage and has been improved in v4.0. And c) no additional cost for users (we have over 50 people looking at data indexed by Splunk). The ""search"" metaphor is also very easy for people to grasp which was an added benefit of the Splunk GUI.<p>My sense has been that at least the low end of the market is increasingly preferring a search-oriented log management architecture versus a database-backed, query-heavy architecture because organizations are familiar with the search metaphor, the overhead of managing a search index is less than the cost of database administration, and the unsophisticated use case (i.e., free-text search rather than advanced query syntax) is increasingly common. Smaller organizations also rarely have the maturity to deal with logging systematically since it requires a pretty systematic approach to infrastructure. That said, the tradeoffs we made may or may not apply in a terabytes-per-day environment, I unfortunately can't speak to it directly.",1264484073

Yes you can use proxies, but the government can find out you are using proxies. It is easy to encrypt the information, so the government may not know what you are accessing, but they do know that you are encrypting your communications.<p>The thing is that if you are using proxies then you can get into a lot of trouble. Then you cannot claim innocence, you cannot say that you were led astray, or you were just curious, etc., because you took active and complex steps to avoid a government security measure. And if you were stupid enough to use very strong encryption, then you are in even more trouble because the police will not know what you did, so they will assume the worst.<p>So no, ""just use Tor"" is not an answer.<p>Regarding about how you think China is run, well I have not been to China, but in my experience with the other communist country that is not the case. That is probably the ideal a communist country strives for, and they often believe they are ran that way, but what usually happens is that there is some kind of test used as a gatekeeper, and after that the people that are just good at politics win out. It is the same as any large organisation, such as most corporations. The corporation likes to think they only promote the smartest and most able people, but really the people that are best at office politics usually climb to the top (although there usually is a minimum intelligence they must possess).",1264482264

One of the article's central elements is the widespread nature of teachers who do not have a firm grasp of the very subject matter they teach, even at an elementary school level. That's a very serious and fundamental failing of the public school system and relevant to the discussion at hand even if the underlying reasons for that failing were not brought up in the original article.<p>Indeed, I think moving the discussion one or two levels deeper is worthwhile. As in software development, there is almost always a tendency to discuss defects at a superficial level, often resulting in superficial fixes which mask symptoms instead of fix the underlying root causes. In this case the urge to paper over cracks in an increasingly fundamentally broken system is a mistake, better to find out what's at the root and fix the problems there.",1264482218

The GFW uses deep packet inspection, so not only are there blacklisted websites but they also analyse the content your viewing.<p>People say there are trivial methods to get around the GFW but I haven't found any that work(short of buying access to a VPN, and currently unless you have an international creditcard you can't). Where are the trivial methods that work if there are so many of them?<p>This is a censor-ship net where the gaps are constantly being closed, a few years ago it WAS trivial to get around, not anymore, and it's becoming more difficult as the GFW systems and methods advance (using technologies provided by western companies such as Nokia, Motorola, Microsoft etc)<p>note-formatted so post can get through the GFW",1264482179

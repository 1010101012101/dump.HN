My girlfriend lives there, and besides being the powerhouse economy of the Eurozone at the moment, they seem to have more or less successfully blended a highly successful capitalist economy with realistic and humane social initiatives.  To broadly generalize, the people here have a strong work ethic, are highly educated by average US standards, and take pride in what they do.  They have a strong outdoors tradition and have highly progressive (again, by US standards) green-living initiatives.<p>While I'm not yet that well educated in Germany politics and policies, my initial vague impression is that while they're not as big on certain civil rights as people ostensibly are in the States (open government censorship and sometimes discriminatory hiring practices, for example), neither do they have any illusions about those policies.  If you do cross the law, punishments appear reasonable--not $3 million and a lifetime of bankruptcy and lawyers if you share 5 songs on Kazaa.<p>Lots of other countries like to poke fun and point out the flaws in many of Germany's policies, and they certainly may be right, but Germany as viewed from the lens of a self-employed American engineer unable to get even basic health insurance is, at times, seemingly a progressive paradise.",1318251470

Much like Google, Netflix has such a huge lead nobody wants to give it a fair break anymore. In many cases, companies won't even give it an unfair break.<p>Without the support of content providers, Netflix went from disrupting the cable TV industry to playing catch up with HBO. Its only hope now is to produce some killer original content, license what it can, and sell its premium ""channel"" as a supplement rather than a replacement. All of the upside from its slowing DVD business will have to go into content production, which will eventually put it on even footing with HBO, Showtime, NBC, CBS, Fox, et al.<p>If I had to guess, the original plan was to sell off Qwikster.

Honeycomb's source (and only the ONE revision of Android) was not released and I can spout off the three most popular theories, but it doesn't really matter. We've been round and round this many times. If Google chooses to skip releasing 3.0 source, why is that particularly different than me choosing to develop on my own private Git repo and jump from version 1.0 to 3.0 while only releasing 2.0 in binary form. Is it ""less"" open source? Depends on how you want to define ""is"" and ""open source"" I suppose, but I'm inclined to enjoy it. As far as I'm concerned it's ""open source enough"", in that both my D1 and Fascinate are running fully open source operating systems (aside from proprietary drivers obviously).<p>>is tightening the licensing agreements to exert control (and doing so in such a way that anyone who isn't a proper licensee will struggle to compete).<p>Um, no they're not.

I got to play with the Planck alpha, and Plink ""feels"" similar in certain ways. The way the notes are displayed as ripples, the way motion across the play area triggers notes on a scale with different instruments (which in Planck are ""weapons""), and the way the notes are quantized. In Planck, the notes/loops happen when you hit something you're shooting at, but the point isn't so much to hit things as it is to create rhythmic loops between the gameplay and the music you're generating. It makes some interesting compromises to keep the music on tempo and still give the sense of hitting the targets instantly.

Turning loops and so on into a giant, inflexible (unless you want two wide-screen monitors) daisy-chain of methods does not improve the readability or maintainability of code. It also encourages programmers to perform actions that should otherwise be in ""repository"" classes, in inappropriate places.<p>The from item in blah syntax is just SQL rearranged, and SQL isn't as expressive as programming language constructs, so why try to emulate it?<p>It encourages you to write the grain of salt statement I mentioned earlier, which requires programmers to read through and understand the implementation of what you are doing, instead of it being embodied in a meaningful method and called. Of course you could just wrap that in a method, and slowly grow the line to 2-3 wide-screen monitors as you add more conditions.<p>The more tools you add to the core of a language, the more of a monstrosity of a kitchen sink it becomes (c#/.NET). Now you can loop over a list in 6 different ways! Hooray! That is why Dart looks good - a few basic concepts that can be used to build things suited to a particular problem.",1318249960

If you are compiling from the command line it takes a long time (I know this is caused by the jvm startup time, but it still is a little annoying). I know there are workarounds such as cljs-watch but setting everything up right definitely takes some time. The browser-based Repl is awesome but sometimes breaks, I don't always understand why. I do think there could be some improvements in terms of tutorials but those will surely come (I might write one...)<p>So if you are using it on a daily basis then all of this probably doesn't matter but it does take a bit to get started.

I am not using it for billing nor for monitoring employees, but for monitoring how I spend time. The purpose is to balance work between my several projects on which I work concurrently, and also to avoid procrastination and wasting time on distractions.<p>I spent a lot of time (pun intended), i.e. about half a day, on searching a time tracker that would fit my needs. I was not interested in features related to billing clients, and thus I found too expensive the services that seem to be most popular, like Harvest, whose pricing starts at $12 per month if one works on more than 2 projects. I would not pay more than $1 per month for a simple time tracking service. I needed a web application / service, as opposed to client software, since I work on multiple computers. Also, the ideal service that I was looking for would have an Android app such that I could track time when I'm not using a computer.<p>Toggl does all of these within the free plan, however it is somehow buggy - the Android app, the desktop app and the web service do not synchronize well and I am kind of forced to use just the web service through a browser.<p>I would be interested to find out about other apps that would do the job.",1318248957

Since I was using Netscape, everything worked fine and I didn't care. Some time later, I began to see images saying ""Best viewed in Internet Explorer"". Everything still worked fine, so I still didn't care... but as time went on, more of those images popped up, and the pages they appeared on began to look much, much scrappier in Netscape than they did in Explorer. While most of them still worked, more or less, Explorer made a noticeable improvement.<p>So, three cheers to Explorer for defeating Netscape and improving client-side development for everybody, right? Find a web-developer who still has to work with IE6 and ask them what they think.<p>Right now, Dart is freely-licensed and available to everybody, but who can contribute to it? Who will be allowed to veto compatibility-breaking changes? What happens if Apple announces some new hardware platform, and then Google coincidentally decides that supporting that platform in the Dart VM is no longer a priority, refuses to accept patches for it, and later refactorings happen to make it very difficult to maintain outside the official tree? What if the Dart VM becomes strategically important like Android, and current releases are only available to approved partners?<p>Sure, it's very unlikely that all those things would happen, and fairly unlikely that even one of them would: up until now, Google has stuck pretty close to the ""do no evil"" thing. But if we stick with openly, collaboratively created technologies, those things are <i>impossible</i>, and ""impossible"" is better than ""unlikely"" in my book.<p>If Dart were some kind of server-side thing Google wanted to use to increase the responsiveness of their sites, or something else internal to their systems, I wouldn't care  they're allowed to do whatever they want in the privacy of their own servers. It's only because the value proposition of Dart is ""give Google an inherent advantage of control over the Web, and in exchange you will get shiny things"" that I'm concerned. There'll always be more shiny things, but (so far) there's only one Web.",1318248943

And as far as tooling goes... well Google's history means they're unlikely to be those handling that, who's going to build tooling for Dart, and why would they have any reason to make that investment instead of improving their JS support further, or adding CoffeeScript support?",1318248615

How many of us have sloppy handwriting and after how many hours of us being ""taught""? Handwriting today is much more often for personal use. My handwriting is good enough if I can read it.<p>Teach typing instead. The child will learn a much more useful skill and with many more applications. They'll pick up handwriting as necessary (just as they do typing now). Invert the priorities.",1221407769

Yet evolution also means that most participants, be they organic or electronic, <i>fail</i>, in the sense that they don't lead to descendants which carry on their code. Only a tiny fraction of all organisms/software have living/executing progeny today.<p>The article says Gall noted: ""A simple system may or may not work."" I'd add: ""A simple system that works isn't necessarily any good.""",1221407016

If this fellow had clearly identified his market before specing out and ordering his product he would have completely avoided his first-iteration fiasco.<p>I also suspect a bit more research would have shown that empty cases (which the customer would fill with their own product) would sell just as well.  Instead, he plowed on through to obtain more inventory (wasn't discarding expired inventory the inspiration for the product in the first place?) and meet regulations (instructions, etc.) that he probably didn't even need.<p>Do your marketing up-front, folks.  A well-designed product that doesn't address a market isn't much better than this guy's box of greasy, plastic-covered condoms.",1221406132

303813,comment,303720,303720,0,0,rml,,,"As someone who has tutored a number of dyslexic young people, I have seen this pattern repeat itself over and over. The teachers at most schools just don't get it. They seem to think that trying to manipulate children emotionally with ""interventions"" and the like will magically fix their awkward/sloppy/inverted handwriting (letter inversion, as others here may have mentioned, is a classic dyslexia symptom). It's cruel and unnecessary, and reflects a lack of competence.<p>Having said that, I mostly disagree with this writer, though I understand her reaction as a parent. In the course of my training, I was told that handwriting, and cursive handwriting in particular, are important to learn because when done correctly, they reinforce the brain's neural pathways associated with particular letters and sounds (1). For example, we had students stand at a whiteboard and write large cursive letters while reading/saying them at the same time (2). The acronym was V.A.K.: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic. The idea was to associate lots of information (from the eyes, ears and muscles) in the brain with the different letters and their sounds.<p>Of course, most schools don't do that, so the lesson of this article seems to be this: teaching handwriting to kids is bad for them if you're doing it wrong.<p>(1) I'm not a neurologist, so this might be the wrong way to describe it.<p>(2) The students worked one-on-one in private rooms with tutors that they trusted, NEVER in open classrooms. This is an important point.<p>(edited for formatting)",1221405837

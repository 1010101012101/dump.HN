2689849,comment,2686580,2689721,1,0,yaakov34,,,"I apologize that I got testy, I just don't think there is a need to paste the whole valgrind run into the message.<p>Anyway, problem #1 is that valgrind is not a code-coverage tool - it only sees the execution path that just happened. You can, of course, combine it with a code-coverage tool, and people do, but code coverage is an incredibly difficult thing, since a huge number of code paths just don't happen in any normal execution. And those are the dangerous ones, both for malware attacks and for reliability.<p>Problem #2, which is smaller, is that valgrind is just not that perfect - for real-life code with foreign-language interfaces, real-time driver accesses, and so on and so on, it will give false positives and false negatives. This is why it has a feature where it takes a humongous error-suppression file to stop it from showing you things that you're not interested in. That's not a perfect solution.<p>I'm not saying there is nothing you can do - of course you can, and for well-defined projects with strong security goals and very large resources, you can get to excellent security. But even the Sun JVM had buffer overflows, I seem to remember. Those guys have heard of valgrind.<p>If there was a button that someone could push to make C/C++ lack of memory safety stop mattering, it would have been pushed by now.",1308862589

2689847,comment,2689375,2689375,0,0,webjprgm,,,"First, you wouldn't get all programmers.  You'd still have customer service. You'd probably also have executives, teachers, scientists, mechanics to work on robots, doctors, cooks, and then your smattering of people mixed in to help with robotic and computerized tasks.<p>Second, many people are not skilled enough in math and logic to program well.  If programming became as pervasive as math education, lots of people would forget it after high school or never really learn it.  If it became as pervasive as writing (as some commenters mention), then it would exist in a similar state: a collection of highly talented authors and a mass of untalented writers (with some in between). So you'd have to have newer programming environments that let unskilled people get some useful tasks done reasonably well.  We have a lot of work to do before programming environments get there, but some people can make interesting things with mangled Excel spreadsheets or spaghetti code in PHP or copy-paste-modify JavaScript hacks.<p>Third, also as some people mention, labor is cheap in certain parts of the world, so robots aren't economical. Contrary to what some claim, I don't think that will go away.  There will always be some portion of humanity that is not sufficiently educated to be programmers. This could be due to socio-economic circumstances, or it could simply be because they don't want to learn it. Some people go through high school refusing to learn, others drop out. How do you fix that? If they can't get customer service jobs, then they have to sell their manual labor cheap enough to compete with robots. You'd only replace all that if you eliminate poverty on a global level and have excellent education globally too.  Then there won't be cheaper labor, so those jobs will move to robots, and then there won't be enough people wanting to hire humans for labor and so finally that market would cease to exist.  I'm not counting on that happening, not even in a hundred years and possibly not ever.  With a concerted effort we might have a chance at a utopian-like society world-wide in a couple hundred years, but that's plenty of time for wars, natural disasters, apathy, tyrants, terrorists, or any number of things to mess it up.<p>Conclusion: Sure let's make programming environments more accessible to less-nerdy people, and let's improve education about programming, since these things will improve lives. But we won't end up with all programmers.",1308862587

I own a small start-up, so I know how nice it is to operate at a small scale. I let my employees chose their own browser, but I require that they keep it up to date. I can do that because I don't have to worry about supporting 500 people.<p>I've also consulted for very large corporations. The same disruptive ideology that applies to start-ups falls flat with large corporations. The biggest mistake is to take a unilateral position with them. They <i>will</i> fall back to IE. They <i>will</i> stagnate on old versions if we don't work with them. Is that what you want?<p>Maybe your product can avoid the corporate space altogether, but there are a lot of us who rely on them. I don't want to re-live IE6. I want browser makers to acknowledge that changing the corporate world isn't the same as creating Google or Facebook. It's far less glamorous and usually means doing shit in a way that you don't like for longer than you like. Change is coming, but it's coming slowly.<p>I hate line-item rebuttals, because they just turn in to pissing matches, but I did want to offer some clarification on these two points.<p>> Asking for a release timeline and asking for 3 years of support on a dead branch are entirely separate things. It's not unreasonable to ask the Mozilla keep users informed of the release schedule (don't they already do this?), but asking them to support an old version for 3 years seems silly. It takes a lot of manpower and there's no value in it for probably 95% of their customers.<p>Let me clarify: I don't think 3 years is a viable LTS schedule for browsers. I don't know what the time frame is, but I'm sure it's not 3 years, and I'm sure it's not ""We release continuously."" I should have been more clear about what ""similar"" means when referencing Ubuntu. By similar, I mean that they should continue their march forward, but that there should be an occasional LTS release that is maintained for a longer, more planned interval.<p>> I would say it's practical, not naive. If you want a browser that allows you to stagnate while enjoying long-term support, then either start paying someone for support, or start using IE. You agree that web browsers and word processors are different, so why should Mozilla bend over backwards to allow corporations to try to treat them the same?<p>I'm saying it's naive (showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment) to expect that this new development cycle won't have ramifications. Mozilla is free to do what they wish with their product. What I'm claiming is that it will come at the cost of market share in the corporate world. If they don't care about the market share, then go ahead and walk on it.",1308862377

A communal bus departs as soon as it can.

There are a few things I should reply on:<p>> MongoDB stores ALL of the data for a database in a single set of sequentially numbered files.<p>Correct. But are you under the assumption that this means documents are spread randomly inside the files? MongoDB database files work with extents. Each collection consists of multiple extent. The extents may be scattered across the database files but each extent is contiguous.<p>> write-ahead log (WAL), in which the database will group several transactions together to make this a mostly sequential I/O operation<p>Very informative, thanks. I thought the WAL was only a durability feature. Indeed, all the resources that I've read on WAL so far only mention it in the context of durability. I had to read your post a few times to understand that it can be used for optimizing I/O.<p>That said, MongoDB relies on the operating system's I/O scheduler to perform the reordering. It just performs the write without fsyncing, allowing the writes to end up in the OS page cache. The OS is then free to reorder the writes however it likes.<p>How useful is the WAL for reordering I/O compared to what the OS already does? Do you think one is superior to the other? Other than bulk index updates of course.<p>> Only random reads actually become slow in this case, instead of practically every kind of I/O like it does in MongoDB when used in real-world scenarios.<p>Actually after fixing the _id problem my MongoDB database became insanely fast again. I/O reordering <i>does</i> happen in with MongoDB, just not in MongoDB itself.<p>> MongoDB can't give you this indicator because it's dependent on the OS cache entirely.<p>Your technique for measuring the working set sounds not too far off from what I do with MongoDB although I use a few more tools. The 'mongostat' utility shows how many page faults MongoDB gets; this is similar to your buffer miss rates. You can use Linux cgroups to limit MongoDB's page cache size. I also use mincore() and fincore() to see which places in the database files get paged in.<p>All in all, I have to change my opinion and admit that PostgreSQL does do many things better than MongoDB. However I think MongoDB doesn't do as bad as you think it does, and the automatic sharding feature in MongoDB is still something I really need.",1308862277

The only people I see bringing IE6 up in this discussion are those trying to create a false dichotomy between the now-trimonthly release schedules of Firefox and Chrome and something bad.<p>> They want to install software and forget about it for a decade. This is not a realistic model for a browser.<p>Well, if you want browsers to be taken seriously as a platform for running software applications and not just viewing static sites with occasional interactive features, then browser had better become that long-lived.<p>Do you have any idea how much investment Microsoft makes in keeping each new version of Windows backward compatible with software and drivers from the last version (or, more likely, the last several versions)? There is no way they would be the dominant force on the desktop today if they had gone around releasing point updates to Windows every few months and arbitrarily breaking other people's software that was built on their platform.<p>Even your three year figure is telling. If Windows 7 hadn't been able to run existing applications written in the XP era, Microsoft would probably be toast today, having blown two big OS releases in a row and lost the confidence of the developer market. Three years is within the typical lifespan of a single PC in an office environment, particularly these days when IT departments are seriously questioning the value they get from spending time and money on the upgrade roundabout and paying for all these subscription plans. Everything else that came with the PC still runs three years later and still lets people get their jobs done. Why should browsers be anything special?<p>Your final paragraph is just outright denial. Microsoft can and do patch security and compatibility bugs in Word all the time. They just manage to do it without changing the UI, introducing new file formats while obsoleting ones that were fine just six months ago, and breaking a couple of key features that they don't care about because only 5% of users need them.",1308861547

I think what causes so many sentiments against PHP is due in part to the mass adoption of PHP.<p>These days, you find PHP almost everywhere. And how do you get to PHP? Let's assume we are in collage and want to write that next big website that's surely going to rule them all.<p>Now, we don't really know that much about all this ""tech"" stuff. But hey, I can hit ""show source"" in the browser. This must be easy. After a few baby steps with a WYSIWY(WishYoud)G tool, you decide to learn /some/ HTML for good. Once you figure that HTML alone can't do a lot, there's a somewhat native path to PHP.<p>You keep on reading tutorials written by others, who know as much as you or a little more. You are still on the cheap side, and need to keep tight on your money for that next big website you are going to write.<p>And the more you read the more enlightened you feel. Wow! I can actually do that and my dead cheap webhost offers PHP as well. Life is good.<p>Because you don't lack any minimal intelligence, you figure out how to write your next (big) website. You probably didn't succeed in writing the next FaceBook, but hey, you are now /one/ of the /web guys/. You probably think what you are doing is real fun.<p>There are then two paths you can take:
- A: stick with PHP and feel enlightened all the way, when ever you learn some new trick, or
- B: wonder if PHP is the only true real thing. You don't know C or some other ""ancient"" language, so you are still a little afraid. Perl seems to look a lot like PHP but it's syntax is confusing and no one of your friends on the forums you are frequenting is using it anyway. Then there is Python or Ruby. Wow those look strange. No curly braces for function bodies. Why do people here talk about templating? What's this about? Do I need that? PHP was so easy... Anyway, you are still curious and learn about this ""other"" way of writing webapps (that's what we are still primarily concerned with). Once you start to figure out that variables do /not/ have to start with $ to be valid, you wonder what else PHP might have hid from your novice learning? There is a lot more. Not necessarily PHP's fault. Just the lockin in that PHP mindset.<p>----<p>The basic problem with PHP (to me) is that I've seen it to be more a motel on the way to enlightenment.

The global investment in this technology is probably rather large, and you are basically asking that everyone who has spent time and money on the technology should throw it away because your pet browser can't manage a point release without breaking it? Well, sorry, but other people's browsers can, and you just look like your quality control is broken with that argument.<p>> And yes, my point is: move faster.<p>Why? Quite a few of these tools just work, and need little if any maintenance, because the systems behind them also just work and are still in use. You are arguing that people should completely rewrite systems that are working fine and have no current issues, so your browser can advance into untold new territory without bothering about backward compatibility.

Amazon never works, Google.com is always down, ebay doesn't render in half of the browsers.<p>You do realise that both Amazon and Google have had major outages recently, taking down huge numbers of sites that rely on their service infrastructure, right?<p>In fact, contrary to all the advocacy about how cloud-based computing is less risky than doing things in-house because the Internet giants have redundant this and scalable that and on-call the other guy, the record so far is pretty poor.<p>As far as their front-line services, of course the real giants manage to keep something up pretty much all of the time, but even then Amazon has suffered from several obvious bugs in recent months, which must be hitting them in the budget for both the PR and customer support departments.<p>Google aren't much better. Their main site works fine, but for example one client of mine uses Google Docs and I'm not sure we have ever managed to get a meeting together when one of the team's systems didn't have basic access or drawing bugs while trying to use it.

Did their goals fit our goals? There is nothing wrong with using classes. In almost every case, classes work well and have fewer unintended consequences than either IDs or element selectors.""<p>What happened is that CSS was two things at the same time: It was a way of refactoring HTML to remove massive amounts of redundant style information, and a way of trying to bring more ""semantic"" meaning to HTML, for a suitably ill-defined definition of ""semantic"". It was way more successful at the former than the latter, but the latter is what made it the toast of the town and what all the sales pitches were about. You might say the goal was ""semantic"", but especially in the earlier version the <i>result</i> was merely the ability to refactor common styles.<p>As I like to say, goals aren't results. But they are very commonly confused by, well, almost everyone. It is this confusion that got the parts of CSS that were ""merely"" enabling refactoring but weren't ""semantic"" labeled <i>bad and evil</i>. Adding an element like a div to refactor styles is one valid choice that may be useful; adding a ""non-semantic div"" is evil from the semantic point of view.",1308860242

XEP-166 and XEP-167 for Google Talk calls to and from Gmail, iGoogle,
and Orkut.  We have also added the same level of support to libjingle
(<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/libjingle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/libjingle</a>), which is used by many native
clients.  From this point on, it will be our primary signalling
protocol, and the old protocol will only remain for backwards
compatibility.  We also plan to soon update Google Talk on Android to
speak Jingle, but we do not plan on updating the Google Talk Windows
application.<p>We suggest all clients that interop with Google Talk to switch to
using Jingle rather than the old protocol.  We will remain backwards
compatible with legacy clients by continuing to speak the old protocol
as well.  If you wish to continue working with legacy clients, such as
the Google Talk application for Windows, you may also wish to continue
speaking the old protocol.  But the future is Jingle, and the old
protocol will eventually go away.<p>Finally, we are still working on implementing XEP-176 (ICE-UDP).  In
the meantime, you'll need to use our draft-06 version of ICE, which is
implemented both in libjingle and in libnice, two open source
libraries.<p>I hope that this will be a support to the Jingle community and futher
our efforts to have open standards for voice and video communication.",1308860099

Either that or we need a mixed system between what we have now and the public being able to vote on some laws, even if the final decision is not taken by the public. But it would be great if people could have a more direct influence on the laws being made, even if it's just only a few of them where the public can participate.<p>For example it could be a 2 step process where for laws that <i>could</i> be very important and they think the public might want to weigh in on the matter, they could vote whether the law should be voted by the public or not. And even then if say 60% of the public vote NO and are against the law, the politicians could still decide to pass the law, but obviously they could get a lot of bad press if its considered they didn't respect the people's wishes.<p>I think a mixt system like that or something similar, could be better than what we have today because then we wouldn't have politicians do everything regardless of what the public says, and it also not go to the extreme where you'd have a completely liquid democracy and all votes would be voted by the public.<p>I'd like to see a system that takes the best of both worlds. I don't know what the exact balance should be, but it could be debated and eventually we could come out with a realistic formula. For example it could be decided that if 51% says NO, then the public has the final decision.

Last I shopped for broadband the best you could get was a vague ""up to x mbps"" number, without any information as to reliability, not to mention minimum speeds.<p>(And with a wired connection you ought to be able to say pretty easily what the minimum speed is going to be 90% of the time.)",1308859393
2689620,comment,2688788,2689543,3,0,jessedhillon,,,"Possibly.<p>I like to think -- informed by my own experience -- that PHP collects a disproportionate share of bad programmers because it's the easiest for bad programmers to use. Chiefly, it is possible to start writing scripts with not even a modicum of planning and forethought; you only need to know what your filename will be. So it stands to reason that they would move on to the new easiest language for bad programming.<p>Or maybe they would rediscover their passion for something other than web dev, go back to school and get English degrees.<p>I can hope, can't I?",1308859350

Sure, there are still criticisms for JavaScript but for the most part people have settled and realized that to make JavaScript good you have to write good code. Which is exactly the case for PHP.<p>The trendiness of PHP bashing exasperates the actual issues of PHP which can easily be abated with good practices.<p>We need a call for someone to get up and preach the best practices of PHP. And with that, a call for PHP Lint based on those best practices. There are a few individual attempts at providing JS Lint type analysis for PHP files but nothing from anyone with clout. We could use an official analyzer supported by recognized field leaders pushing quality coding practices.",1308859285

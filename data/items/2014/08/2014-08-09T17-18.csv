I said &quot;Because if we keep on increasing velocity, soon we will hit the speed of light.&quot;  I had no better response.<p>Also, they tend to compare velocities between teams.

8157502,comment,8156786,8157085,4,0,jahewson,,,"There are costs to sticking with the imperial system. Non-US buyers want metric products which fit with their existing tooling. The factories of the world want all-metric manufacturing, which reduces costs. Error from unit conversion is a real problem.<p>Designing new products in metric wouldn&#x27;t require old products to be replaced with imperial. Each product line has it&#x27;s own special repair kit, spare parts, already. It&#x27;s not like the suppliers who actually make parts aren&#x27;t equipped to do metric if they&#x27;re selling parts worldwide.<p>The UK went metric in the 1960s and it managed just fine, so there&#x27;s no reason why it can&#x27;t be done. Some pragmatism can be involved, for example road signs in the UK are still in miles, and one can still buy a pint of milk or beer (though the latter are technically labelled and sold in millilitres).<p>A move to metric wouldn&#x27;t dictate the internal practices of a company like Lockheed, they could still require their suppliers to build parts in inches (even if that means that formally they purchase 2.6234cm sized screws or similar) and they can continue to do everything in inches.

8157499,comment,8156267,8156267,6,0,rgbrenner,,,"<i>For every copy an e-book would sell at $14.99, it would sell 1.74 copies if priced at $9.99. So, for example, if customers would buy 100,000 copies of a particular e-book at $14.99, then customers would buy 174,000 copies of that same e-book at $9.99. Total revenue at $14.99 would be $1,499,000. Total revenue at $9.99 is $1,738,000. The important thing to note here is that the lower price is good for all parties involved: the customer is paying 33% less and the author is getting a royalty check 16% larger and being read by an audience that&#x27;s 74% larger. The pie is simply bigger.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t prove what Amazon wants to claim it does.<p>1) Authors don&#x27;t just earn royalties from ebook sales. They also earn royalties from hardcover/paperback sales.. and if dropping the ebook price causes lowered paperback sales, then the authors could earn less.<p>So merely showing that lower ebook prices increase ebook sales does not prove Amazon&#x27;s claim that lower prices increase authors&#x27; royalties.<p>2) Amazon&#x27;s test may not even prove that it would increase ebook sales. Hachette earns money from the sale if the book is sold at BN, Amazon, or any retailer. If only Amazon lowers it&#x27;s price to $10, then Amazon may just be getting additional sales that would have gone to other retailers. So the only thing Amazon&#x27;s test proves is that Amazon would be better off in a fictional world where Amazon has the lowest price in the market -- 33% lower than any other retailer.",1407606893

Some of my co-workers would kibitz or play chess in the park, and I began playing as well.  I became very focused on improving as I felt it was keeping my mind sharp, as my day job was not doing that.<p>One way to improve your chess skills is to play tournament length games against opponents at or slightly above your skill level.  Then you go over the game with a better player (or a chess engine) and see where you made your worst mistakes.  Then you look at those positions and remember what the proper move to do is.<p>So that&#x27;s what I did.  I ran crafty against my online tournament games and had it find what my worst moves were (missed opportunities and blunders).  Then I ordered the moves in terms of how bad the mistake was.  Then I kept looking at the boards over and over to train myself in what the right move was.  If I did it long enough, I&#x27;d memorize the boards and instantly know what the right move was.  Doing this improves your game.<p>I put the results here - <a href=""http://blunderchess.sf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blunderchess.sf.net</a> .  It requires a LAMP setup.

If you don&#x27;t like how it tastes, it&#x27;s not good wine. That&#x27;s it.<p>The wine world is notoriously pretentious.<p>It&#x27;s good to know locations, varietals and aging a little because it can help you narrow the window down to find a wine you&#x27;ll probably like well enough vs ones you won&#x27;t. I for example, tend not to like Malbecs. Why? I dunno, just something in the flavor. I also don&#x27;t like Mountain Dew.<p>Wine can help accent or suppress flavors in your food as well. Just like drinking beer with pizza tastes good, you probably wouldn&#x27;t drink coke with your morning cereal.<p>If you really want to get into wines, there seems to be a correlation between rating and flavor complexity. And there&#x27;s all kinds of ways to taste (or miss) complexity in wines. Just like a good bbq sauce has elements of sweet, sour, spicy, etc., wine can be more or less complex in flavors. But not everybody likes complex flavors and that&#x27;s fine. That&#x27;s <i>easier</i> in fact since complexity is <i>usually</i> a result of more expensive wine making processes like aging so your local Two-Buck Chuck might make those people happy. But detecting the differences or preferences for flavor complexity is like detecting the differences between two different batches of your grandmother&#x27;s home-made Spaghetti sauce. You can probably describe it (the first had more garlic, the second more basil), but absolute comparisons are really impossible and don&#x27;t really matter all that much. It&#x27;s like asking &quot;which is better a sponge or the number 7?&quot;<p>Something revealed to me during trips to various places where a glass of wine with lunch or dinner is normal, is that wine is just another drink. Some of the better meals I&#x27;ve had were had with a 2 euro 1/2 L carafe of the local watered down table wine. In these places, wine is just a drink, like juice, water or soda. People who drink wine with every meal really don&#x27;t care what the wine is so long as it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.<p>You can probably find more than enough wines anybody will like for under $10 a bottle.<p>It&#x27;s just a drink.",1407605396

It divides into 3rds far more easily, divides into 4ths slightly more easily, and still divides into 5ths with only one digit after the decimal.<p>Just like computer programmers have no problem immediately recognizing that 256 is 2^8, it became intuitive when working with the Imperial system (at limited scales) that 48 inches is the same as 4-feet but that it is also 3-stud-distances long (studs in walls are often placed 16 inches apart).<p>Even if you don&#x27;t work in crafts where dividing things by 3 is more frequent than dividing by 5 it is easy to imagine how certain things might be more difficult if we used base-10 for time (as, it has been pointed out, has been attempted)- and thereby using the ability to easily divide an hour into 3 parts (for example).<p>Consistent base-10 and international standardization has advantages that far outweigh these minor things- but I think it&#x27;s important to recognize that there is, surprise, a rational practical reason for sticking in some cases to Imperial units- it&#x27;s not purely tradition or politics or their &quot;organic-ness&quot; (anymore).",1407604742

How about instead of quoting random opinions, let&#x27;s look into what actually happened in the real world? For one thing I don&#x27;t think the book industry has suffered much since the introduction of the Penguin books?<p>This reminds me of the piracy debate. Was Microsoft helped or hurt by the rampant piracy of the Windows OS? I&#x27;m pretty sure they were helped a lot (how else achieve 99% lock in), but presumably the point could be argued back and forth indefinitely (people who would argue either point would be plentiful to find).<p>Also the discussion is completely besides the point. Two businesses can&#x27;t agree on a price. Neither of the two has a moral obligation to sell books for a certain price. If they don&#x27;t agree, they simply don&#x27;t sell books to each other. Why does that even concern anybody else?",1407603639

He&#x27;s laying out a restriction on ANY action by the US government against a US citizen outside of the US... the restriction against the US government has nothing to do with her detention]:<p>the Court held that American citizens outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States retain the protections guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the decision below granting Mrs. Covert’s habeas petition was affirmed. Black wrote: “[W]e reject the idea that when the United States acts against citizens abroad it can do so free of the Bill of Rights. The United States is entirely a creature of the Constitution. Its power and authority have no other source. It can only act in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution. When the Government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad, the shield which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land.”",1392087554

Yes it never went live, and yes it&#x27;s new people now; both of those things are irrelevant unless there was a complete code re-write at some point.<p>On to your next point, there certainly is a problem with being in over your head if you&#x27;re dealing with financial trading. Some industries are not suited to amateur attempts, period. Think of the amount of litigation MTGox are opening themselves up to, not just in terms of people who use them, but based on the wider impact to the BTC community if they really stuff things up.

Mostly because of corruption, evil financial institutions, inflation is bad, technical superiority, ...<p>At the end of the day, it does not really matter. The people that have the power to adopt it listen to different arguments. Although a lot of them recognize the same problem as people on HN, they share the same opinion as you do. The others have no interest in changing a system that favors them. So the point is mood regardless what my opinion is.<p>The only other option is to have the population impose its currency. In a lot of third world countries, the USD has been adopted as a alternative to the local currency. They could adopt bitcoin. To them, the possibility to build complete financial services outside the official channels is good. Having a currency controlled by few rich people rather than the US government and few rich people could be perceived as an improvement.<p>Difficult to see that happening in the biggest economies though. The balance between corruption and general interest is good enough, and there is just nothing for the consumer.<p>The key to bitcoin success is the balance between popular interest in emerging nations and the games the financial institutions of the first world nations extracting as much profit out of it. Significant success in that area could force first world economies to deal with bitcoin as a currency, despite its flaws.<p>After that, eventually, I guess there is the extremely remote possibility that bitcoin proves a better currency in the long term and gets adopted (for example, in a world where growth and recessions alternate all the time, it may become beneficial to rely on a currency with predictable deflation / inflation curve rather than a man being a printer )<p>That&#x27;s an awful lot of ifs.",1392087314

I don&#x27;t have any easy answers, but here&#x27;s some of the tools that helped me:<p>- Exercise. I know, it sounds dumb, especially when you&#x27;re depressed and have no energy, but it&#x27;s an incredibly effective way of hacking your brain chemistry. Run, swim, bike, hike, just pick one and pour all your frustration, anger, and sadness into it.<p>- Get a hobby. I spent a lot of time worrying about being interesting to others, which guaranteed I wouldn&#x27;t be. Being interesting is a many-body problem with lots of unknowns, but being interested is way more solvable. You can figure out what you like a lot more easily than you can guess what might make other people like you. Don&#x27;t rule something out because it seems dorky, I guarantee you&#x27;ll find other people who enjoy it too, even if it&#x27;s Lego or collecting old maps. It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to understand what you actually want though, especially if you&#x27;ve been focused on what other people think.<p>- Beware of magical transformations. I got married at 19, driven by an overwhelming desire to completely change my life to find happiness. It didn&#x27;t work. I also took a lot of drugs. That didn&#x27;t work either. I saw people get pulled into cult-like religions or extreme political groups. Drastic exterior changes don&#x27;t alter who you are, you&#x27;ll still have the same problems, no matter what anyone tells you. Focus on boring incremental improvements, like exercise and hobbies. I hated that idea, because I was in love with my life being dramatic and the basic stuff seemed so mundane, but it&#x27;s what ended up making a lasting difference.<p>I doubt I&#x27;d have even listened to my present-day self when I was 19, but I hope there&#x27;s something in there that helps you.

My guess would be that the average age of published and active writers skews higher than 20s, and maybe even above the 30s. So it would put most writers in line with publishers who are used to dealing with B&N as a distributor.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in variety. I can&#x27;t really recall a situation where there was something available on Amazon that was not also available on B&N. The exception could be for self-published authors who have foregone options to make their books available elsewhere. (I just looked up one self-published author I know of and it was available for the same price on B&N.)<p>It might be an age thing where younger people, who are more likely to self-publish, coming up will probably not strongly associate B&N with books. Borders(RIP) and B&N are older national chains.<p>But my own bias pushed me toward getting a Nook. I have a slight distrust for Amazon&#x27;s platform being less open, and Amazon becoming too powerful because they&#x27;re so good at what they do. I think consumers , writers, publishers, and even the economy are better off if there is more competition.

The psychology of sex differences. Vol. 1. Stanford University Press, 1974? And the additional analysis by Janet Hyde in papers like &quot;How large are cognitive gender differences? A meta-analysis using! w² and d..&quot; American Psychologist 36.8 (1981): 892? (Plus more recent work. Those citations come from the full paper behind the link I posted previously, which lists many more references.)<p>There&#x27;s a century of work on this topic. Some say there are differences, others say there aren&#x27;t any. The ones that say there are differences don&#x27;t seem to be that reproducible. There&#x27;s publication bias as well - someone finds a difference, but when the test is repeated the difference decreases or even disappears. This is expected for the reasons behind <a href=""http://xkcd.com/882/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/882/</a> and elaborated in that 1974 reference as:<p>> We shall return now to the importance of the null hypothesis - to point with some alarm to the tendency for isolated positive findings to sweep through the literature, while findings of no difference, or even later findings of opposite results, are ignored. Studies with nonreplicable[sic] positive findings are reprinted in books of readings, cited in textbooks, and used to buttress theories about the nature of the development of sex typing.<p>along with a quote about their hypothesis for why beliefs about cognitive sex persist:<p>> An ancient truth is worth stating here: if a generalization about a group of people is believed, whenever a member of that group behaves in the expected way the observer notes it and his belief is confirmed and strengthened; when a member of the group behaves in a way that is not consistent with the observer&#x27;s expectations, the instance is likely to pass unnoticed, and the observer&#x27;s generalized belief is protected from disconfirmation. We believe that this well-documented process occurs continually in relation to the expected and perceived behavior of males and females, and results in the perpetuation of myths that would otherwise die out under the impact of negative evidence.<p>Or there&#x27;s papers like Feingold, Alan. &quot;Cognitive gender differences are disappearing.&quot; American Psychologist 43.2 (1988): 95. If cognitive gender differences are innate, and easily measurable, then there wouldn&#x27;t be a change over time. That there&#x27;s a decrease says they are either not innate or not easily measurable.<p>You wrote: &quot;So, we can see that the mainstream is in error: even if it turns that there is such evidence, the mainstream doesn&#x27;t generally demand it. (Indeed, those who do demand it risk censure for their beliefs.)&quot;<p>Are you kidding me? There&#x27;s a bajillion people who say there&#x27;s evidence for cognitive sex differences. Here&#x27;s one citation:<p>> &#x27;&quot;Educational systems could be improved by acknowledging that, in general, boys and girls are different,&quot; said David Geary, MU professor of psychological science. &quot;For example, in trying to close the sex gap in math scores, the reading gap was left behind. ...&quot;&#x27; Quote from <a href=""http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2013/0313-international-gender-difference-in-math-and-reading-scores-persists-regardless-of-nations%E2%80%99-gender-equality-levels-says-mu-psychologist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2013/0313-internati...</a> . Author&#x27;s home page <a href=""http://psychology.missouri.edu/gearyd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychology.missouri.edu/gearyd</a> .<p>How has this person been censured?<p>The paper is freely available. It points out that there are measured sex differences, and in hypothesis #3 that it might be &quot;biological in origin, see pp.291–294, pp.411–412 of [10]&quot;, but &quot;At this point, we have no definite answer to what can explain the correlation, which means that it requires further study.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the issue - there is evidence of differences, but there isn&#x27;t strong or significant evidence that those differences are biological in nature. But it&#x27;s very easy to see the difference and assume it must be biological.<p>I see that you reference popular science books and lectures as basis for your decisions. Moreover, all of those resources came from a single person. That is not rigorous. Pinker could be misinterpreting the data and you wouldn&#x27;t know.<p>Where is the primary data? How are the experiments done? What confounding effects might be in the data? How reproducible is it? Can you point me to some of the peer reviewed literature?<p>I looked at the &#x27;human universals&#x27; link. It immediately made me distrustful, since the first one is &quot;environment, adjustments to&quot;. <i>All life</i> adjusts to the environment, so this isn&#x27;t particularly special for humans. It&#x27;s like saying that eating and defecating are human universals; while true, I note they aren&#x27;t on the list.<p>But there&#x27;s easily things in there which are not universal. My cousin doesn&#x27;t prefer sweets. There are people who feel no pain (congenital analgesia). Those without thumbs/hands/arms have no thumb sucking. Yet those people are obviously human. More likely, these &quot;universals&quot; are not actually universal, no?<p>Or take &quot;males dominate public/political realm&quot;? How universal can that be given that Andorra and Rwanda have respectively 50% and 56% female parliamentarians? If there ever is a country with a majority of female politicians across all levels, would this mean Pinker&#x27;s universals hypothesis is completely false?

It&#x27;s always Asteroids, or Moon Lander, or Nanacara Crash, or Pac-Man, or Flappy Bird (OMGWTFBBQ!?). Generally the best advice I can give you is to drag a roomful of kids at computers through the Scratch cirriculum MIT has created, and feel free to skip ahead if they get bored. MIT tends to be all engineery about the curriculum, and leaves no corner unexplained.<p>We find that if you ask kids 8-14 &quot;Wanna learn to make videogames?&quot; the answer is always yes. Then you just have to walk them through it in Scratch. It&#x27;s super easy for them, and it does exactly what MIT designed it to do: teach kindergarteners how to code.",1392084245

7215231,comment,7212919,7212919,1,0,nswanberg,,,"It might have been helpful to distinguish between anonymity within small groups (Secret) vs anonymity in large groups (4chan).<p>In 4chan, particularly on /b/, there are so many anonymous participants that it&#x27;s very unlikely that one person would recognize another. Someone could write something personal about another person, and it seems unlikely that anyone would care, and certainly no-one would remember. There are few real-world consequences. (I found a fun paper on anonymity in 4chan by merely searching for &quot;studies on anonymity&quot; <a href=""http://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf</a>)<p>But in Secret, part of the point is to exchange information about the real world. This seems to be much more likely to have ill effects, possibly like the ones gruesome referred to in the &quot;Rumor Monger&quot; software at Apple that he mentioned elsewhere in this thread.<p>Has anyone found anything interesting about small group anonymity? Is that a useful distinction?",1392084211

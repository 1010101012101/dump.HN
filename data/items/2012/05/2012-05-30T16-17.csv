There is usually a bunch of shares to cover options you're giving your employees, though (""option pool"", something like 20% appears to be common); you may or may not be able to defer giving options until you raise money. (In the case of funding, you keep n% of the pre-money value of the company; in the case of options, you keep n% of the value of the company.)<p>Equity vesting for founders is a good idea, and very common. (If the developer quits in a month, you don't want him to own 25% of the company.) The business guy can make a case that he should have accelerated vesting, since he's been at it for longer. Cliffs are possible (""no shares for the first year""), as is accelerated vesting on change of control (basically, you get your shares faster if the company is sold; this makes it easier to leave, which is bad for the buyer, which lowers the price (s)he'll pay; so this is somewhat hard to negotiate.)<p>The ""fair"" distribution of shares depends very heavily on what everyone brings to the table; you may want to ""Ask HN"" with more details.

Education, for instance, if there is no state-sponsored alternative (it is an alternative, we have private and home schooling in every state as far as I know), the people who have to work for a living often do not educate their children (my wife has an aunt who cannot read or write because her parents worked and she was put to work at an early age, so that's what has always happened in history).

A large part of math is pattern matching: recognizing a common relationship between variables (a common pattern or ""theme"") and investigating that relationship further. This ability is critical to mathematical ability. Visual compactness is crucial here. Using descriptive names will completely bog down your visual system with reading words rather than identifying patterns.<p>Pattern matching is a critical skill when one becomes an expert in any field; in math its of utmost importance. Math is optimized for reading by other experts who have those same visual patterns committed to memory. This is the optimal approach for the work's target audience.

4043457,comment,4042007,4042007,7,0,kamaal,,,"Well as a note regarding outsourcing and Indian IT Bellwethers.<p>I can tell you that you are likely to hear extreme management bashing in this case. But after personally working in a very famous IT bellwether here in India for 5 years, and now in another famous global web company. I can tell you half the people who crib, complain and whine are basically people who expect to get rich by 'getting lucky'.<p>The most common complain is <i>They didn't give me good stuff to work on</i>, yet when you ask the same people what exactly stops them from downloading <insert their favorite programming language compiler/tool>, or why they didn't work on their favorite database while all of it is freely available on the internet- The answer is generally a blank stare. Tons of automation opportunities exist in almost all projects that these big companies take, yet most people you are likely to meet still expect work to be <i>given</i> to them. I have seen this attitude among all freshers and even among some very experienced people. The fact is most of these people arrive at a software industry after having the heard 'Get rich quick' stories from the 90's while somebody joined a IT services company, went to an foriegn onsite location for 5-6 years, became a manager in 4 years and made tons of money in the IPO.<p>In fact most complaints of 'Indian IT sucks' generally smells of 'I could not get rich quick'. With no real desire to make a career in software, and waiting to jump to a management role at the earliest is the hallmark of Indian IT. Getting promotions and holding fancy designations is considered extremely honorable. Let alone most technical leads who managed to win corporate politics race, I know- Can't write a 100 line program. Not getting promoted to managerial role by 27 is considered a sign of incompetence, Not being able to go to a foriegn onsite location is considered a sign of incompetence. Its almost like a blind rush for money, money and only money. I know of many so called Technical leads who boast that they <i>don't write code anymore</i>, trying to imply that people who write code or who are good at tech stuff are generally incompetent people not deserving of progress. How do you expect to make progress or do anything big, with this kind of people stacked from top to down?<p>After doing a lot of analysis, I have finally realized these people never wanted to be programmers ever. They have 0 interest in learning, building and making stuff. They don't have what it takes to make a career in software. These people just arrive at software companies thinking they will get rich very quickly, when they don't, they find every reason under the sun to justify how worse career options in software are. Those who do get rich by usual promotion->onsite cycles, generally go on to become managers and then ulitimately glorified supervisors, who seem to hold very high opinions about tech without knowing a jack about it. Regional and liguistic politics is too common, being the managers best man and bootlicking helps to get better appraisal ratings, promotions and onsite chances.<p>Having said all this, I still meet some very good technical people from whom I learned a lot(In the same big companies). I continue to meet such people.<p>As a last note, the rewards vs efforts system is all messed up and needs immediate fixing. These companies need to bring back meritocracy.",1338394894

His ideas (mostly applicable to factories but easily applied to all companies) helped bring Japan out of its post-war recession and give it the respected reputation for high-quality goods they have had for some time. His concepts have been largely ignored since (partly due to his horribly dry writing style) but I think they're very valuable to our current economic situation in the west as well.<p>The focus is on quality, and the path is through process-based management. You have to realize your employees are a system just like your software is: mostly understandable, and statistically predictable. You can shape your system of people just like you can a manufacturing line, and traditional beliefs about punishments and rewards simply do not apply if you look at what's truly effective in improving quality and improving production.<p>It was remarkably successful in Japan partly because their philosophical backgrounds are so completely different: it is easier for someone brought up with ideas of Zen buddhism or other eastern religions to think of the whole rather than the individual; the process rather than the part.<p>In the US, where we're very much an individual and self-focused society, we track immediately to individual motivation without thought to how it affects the whole company. The unsubstantiated belief that ""what's best for the individual is best for the whole"" is embedded in us and very difficult to shake. Indeed, it's fairly core to our democracy and has ties to political beliefs as well. Deming himself had the breaking of this habit as one of his prerequisites (his System of Profound Knowledge): that everyone in the entire company must understand this holistic way of thinking, not just the management. Surely there is a balance to be struck, but Deming covers that as well, focusing on the psychology of personal motivation and work quality rather than belief systems. And it's all backed up by great process engineering and experience.<p>Honestly I think it's better if you completely ignore the monetary rewards and simply focus on what makes people work the best; the process of work.

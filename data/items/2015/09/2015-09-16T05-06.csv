So common content in the initial 2.2GB and the rest in the swappable chunks.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is for a few reasons, one would be to get debs into the habit of creating these downloadable slices for something down the track.

Your local state senator may have much better access to your federal senator and that level of access can turn into opportunity for them to influence them. If your state representatives know how important their behaviour with regards to federal issues is to you as a voter, you stand a much better chance of the system working how it&#x27;s intended.<p>It&#x27;s systemic lack of involvement that&#x27;s causing the most issues in American politics.

This is great during the good times, because everyone is able to squeeze out that last 5% of performance (or whatever other metric they&#x27;re optimizing for), and this combined effort allows them to keep their lead over the competitor.<p>But it&#x27;s terrible during bad times because of the overstaffing. And firing people just makes things worse because the company loses important parts of its organizational memory. Because of the hyperspecialization, no single person/organization knows how to do all the things that need to be done to get the product out the door. And if you fire 10% of your workforce, you&#x27;re going to forget 10% of the stuff you needed to know to build your products. In fact, you probably lose much more than  10% because people who are actually good see the writing on the wall and leave, taking a disproportional amount of the organizational knowhow with them.<p>I feel like these companies get caught in a death spiral. They can&#x27;t do things the old way because they don&#x27;t know how to any more, and they can&#x27;t do it the way their competitors are doing it either because they never knew how to do that!

I want to be able to tell my team that, if they did a solid week&#x27;s work on it, and it&#x27;s not done then that means our estimates were out and we&#x27;ll adjust the plan. But <i>that</i> is measuring time - they did a week&#x27;s effort even though they didn&#x27;t get the intended result.<p>The flip-side is that if something is estimated to be &quot;a week&#x27;s work&quot; and they get it done in 3 days, then I don&#x27;t expect them to take the next 2 days off. Rather, it means that our estimates were off (in the opposite direction) and we&#x27;ll pick up some additional work this week.<p>To me, &quot;taking 2 days off&quot; and &quot;only working 5 hour days&quot; are essentially the same thing. So if I had a team member who told me &quot;the task I was assigned for this week is actually pretty easy, so I decided to just finish at 2pm each day&quot;, then I&#x27;d consider that wildly inappropriate and tell them so.<p>In the same way, if a manager told an engineer &quot;the task you were assigned this week is really hard, so you&#x27;re probably going to need to work until 9pm each day&quot; that would be wildly inappropriate.<p>I don&#x27;t care very much <i>what hours</i> my team work, as long as it&#x27;s effective - which includes having enough overlapping office time do have in depth technical discussions, and so they can provide mentoring and advice to junior team members (or get advice if they are the junior).

That will probably be impossible to find.<p>I think the trick is to find a different (yet related) role with a company that is expanding rather than contracting their business.<p>Datacenter tech springs to my mind -- a fair number of tech companies have midwest sites (mostly Chicago, sometimes Minneapolis or Nebraska or elsewhere) that don&#x27;t have local techs. Issues are often handled by the east coast team flying out, which is less than ideal. Someone with that many years of hardware experience is pretty hard to find for those types of roles.",1442379878

I live in Italy, and in the last years we have get accustomed to news like &quot;four hundred refugees reached Sicily last night&quot;, &quot;50 Syrians died yesterday when their boat sank near the coast&quot;, etc. Reading this helps in preventing me from thinking of these people as just numbers.",1442379873

It&#x27;s a natural thing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure of the papers he&#x27;s signed (non-competes...), or the contracts that HP has with their customers (there must be some), but... he could definitely &quot;get the band together&quot; and pull off such a feat. Again, I think this goes back to the contracts he had.<p>He&#x27;s one of 4 remaining from the &quot;blue days&quot; (time with Digital); I think they&#x27;d be able to pull it off if they did go this route.

Made a beautiful whooshing and humming noises. Kept it for more than 10 years. When they discovered a tendency for premature wear on the pickup rollers, HP sent me a maintenance kit: one day it just showed up with instructions. I had a zd7000 laptop in the early oughts. It was pretty badass for it&#x27;s day. Lasted until my boy closed the top with a pen on the keyboard and cracked the screen.<p>HP was a different company that made good stuff.",1442379797

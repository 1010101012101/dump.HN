For example, in Germany such companies could potentially have terms similar to a contractual agreement (called AGB) that apply as soon as you post a letter.<p>The underlying point is really this: the current status quo (good protection for physical mail, no protection for electronic mail) is not something that makes sense if you start reasoning from first principles. It simply developed this way for historical reasons (mainly: webmail providers were created in much more lawyer-happy times, and the rules for physical mail developed over a longer time, during which respect for privacy was valued higher for whatever reason).<p>I believe that it is a fairly safe bet that, if the internet still exists 100 years from now, most places that will be considered civilized in that future will have laws to protect their citizens&#x27; privacy no matter what companies would like to write in their contracts.<p><i>Whose moral considerations would these be?</i><p>In a democratic society?

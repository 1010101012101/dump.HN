Risky because academia is only loosly connected to the working world - so much of what is taught will turn out to be irrelevant.<p>While still unproven alternative education techniques such as online or internships/apprenticeships may turn out to be more effective and much less expensive. If employers become convinced traditional diplomas and degrees are unreliable indicators of quality and better alternatives exist, we could see a sudden shift away from traditional education.<p>Would you rather hire someone with a middle ranking college degree or two years experience and a letter of recommendation from their boss?

Maybe you should consider that the purpose of copyright law was not to provide you and your kids a revenue stream for life but rather to encourage free thought and exchange of ideas by providing a limited period of protection before a work became public domain. The original copyright term when congress passed the first copyright law was 14 years. But greedy entertainment industry attorneys have been able to pay off congress over the years and have the terms extended, until now, thanks to the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act, the expiration of copyright is effectively gone.  In fact nothing will enter the public domain for decades now.<p>So maybe instead of complaining that the average Joe&#x27;s of the world need to listen to more commercials or pay you more for something you did 20 years ago you could put that energy into something new.

I went to grad school in Industrial Engineering/Operations research because I wanted to study a field where engineering type thinking is applied outside the traditional engineering fields.<p>The things I&#x27;ve learned in engineering and science classes constantly influence my thinking outside these fields. For example, I recently did a computer science programming assignment (coursera data structures) about percolation and phase transitions.  Immediately, I started seeing the model in so many things - vaccine coverage in a population where people start to opt out, availability of housing, the dating scene as people start to pair off and get married.  Any probabilistic process where things seem steady state until the last moment, and then a sudden shift occurs.  I know my example may be a little trivial, but that&#x27;s the point - some of these are silly, and probably very misapplied, but other times, they lead to extraordinary insight.  My thinking about a very wide range of things is deeply influenced by may background in math and engineering.  I constantly build math models in my head when I read the news.  I see it as a basic form of literacy - and you only get it if you really engage with the kind of difficult math typical of STEM fields.<p>I really think that humanities students are in greater danger of ending up narrowly focused than science students.  Even if I hadn&#x27;t majored in literature, I (like most STEM students) would have had to take a substantial amount of history, art, literature, foreign languages, and so forth as part of my GE requirements in college.

You need an IDE to even be remotely efficient, an IDE that Apple also controls.<p>- More work to port anywhere else. Popular app on iOS and want it on android? Time to rebuild the entire thing from scratch in another language!<p>- More expensive. Want to sell your app?

5948866,comment,5947584,5947584,2,0,chinpokomon,,,"It seems the biggest problem is the metric used to establish royalties. Broadcast mediums like radio can&#x27;t accurately account for how many listeners they have, and so their licensing terms are based on plays. Pandora on the other hand knows exactly how many listeners it had, because the stream is per individual, nit broadcast. Neither medium accounts for inactive listeners, but I would expect the distribution would be similar. The bottom line is that Pandora is closer to every individual having their own radio station and so of course you cannot evaluate their worth the same way, despite what the original article was trying to do.<p>Pandora&#x27;s model actually works better for the artists, since there is metadata that could be used to spy on American citizens... whoops, wrong story; that could be used to connect to fans in markets the artist may not have had access to previously. Maybe Pandora should be selling that information to the artists and labels, although I don&#x27;t know that they don&#x27;t do that already.<p>Both radio and Pandora are more appropriately described as advertisement. Playback restrictions of both formats means that listening to something is not purely selective in the part of the listener. I can&#x27;t request that Pandora play Cracker&#x27;s Low, anymore than I can shout that request to my radio. However both give me exposure to music that I might not otherwise hear. Extra credit goes to Pandora for giving me easy access to the Artist, Album, and Song Title, as well as up sell links whereby I can purchase the music I&#x27;m listening to.<p>Pandora provides much more value than terrestrial broadcast - value for which the music industry should probably be paying Pandora. I fully appreciate the positron Pandora finds themselves in, but they aren&#x27;t in a fair fight, and the artists that should be supporting them don&#x27;t seem to understand that distinction for their own good.",1372279209

There are a lot of people who have taught themselves to program as a means to an end, and I think that makes them &quot;better&quot;, in some sense, than someone who started their CS degree in search of a paying job without ever writing a line of code.<p>Of course, the above is very binary, and as comfortable as we programmers might be with that, (and if I may issue a blanket cop-out at the last second), I think &quot;self-taught&quot; is a small facet of the whole that makes a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; programmer.",1372278788

5948741,comment,5939498,5939498,1,0,graycat,,,"This thread does a lot on asking what is a <i>start\nup</i> and what about taking equity funding, e.g., from\na venture capital firm, versus remaining a company\n100% owned by the founder(s).<p>The discussion keeps trying to find simplistic\n<i>patterns</i> that cover most of the cases.  I claim\nthat such <i>new businesses</i> (<i>start ups</i>) are so\nvaried that we should not look for simplistic\npatterns and, instead, just look at the businesses\nthemselves.<p>Here is an approach to some insight into the growth\nof a new business:  Commonly the intended or\n<i>expected</i> growth is modeled with a spreadsheet\nwith, say, one column for each <i>planning interval</i>\n(maybe one month) in the plan of growth, but long\nago I decided just to use an interpretive procedural\nlanguage with, essentially, a Do-loop with one pass\nfor each planning interval.<p>So, of course the Do-loop has some variables.  So\nmaybe we have some variables for business decisions,\nfor random exogenous inputs, and for the <i>state</i> of\nthe business.<p>Considering all of these variables and the <i>business\ndynamics</i> during each planning interval, we see that\nwe can have a lot of complexity.<p>In particular, in some of this complexity, we can\nsee that the business can run short of various\nnecessary <i>resources</i> such as management time,\ncapacity of the server farm in users served per\nsecond, disk space used by the database software,\ntime to hire and train staff, floor space used by\nthe staff, rate of writing software, ads served per\nsecond, revenue from the ads, delays in getting paid\nby the companies running the ads, etc.<p>So, there are lots of &#x27;constraints&#x27; or limitations\nwhich can slow the growth of the business.<p>Generally, if usage and revenue are growing slowly\nand the free cash is low, then we react by slowing\ndown on hiring, buying servers, etc.<p>Yes, it can be that a big check of equity funding\ncan open or <i>relax</i> many of these constraints.  But\nit may be that margins and free cash flow are nicely\nhigh and the constraints that are &#x27;tight&#x27;, e.g.,\nmanagement time, rate at which can bring on more\nsoftware engineer staff, are not <i>relaxed</i> by equity\nfunding.<p>Programming a multi-interval growth model makes\nthese points quite clear.  Just envisioning such\nsoftware should, for the HN audience, also make the\npoints plenty clear.<p>So, net:  We can&#x27;t generalize.  It might be that for\nsome start up, equity funding cannot help its growth\nbecause cash is not nearly one of the tight\nconstraints and, instead, the start up might be able\nto grow as fast as possible just <i>organically</i>.\nCommon?  No.  Possible in principle?  Yes.  Possible\nin practice?  Maybe, but don&#x27;t try to generalize or\ntheorize.  Instead, if have such a case, then\nrecognize, accept, and run with it and tell the\npeople with equity capital &quot;no thanks&quot;.<p>So, really, we can&#x27;t generalize: <i>Organic</i> growth\nmight be for a business that has just one pizza shop\nand will never have more, a business selling donuts\nthat opens a new location once a quarter, a Web site\nthat is a <i>lifestyle</i> business and gives the sole\nproprietor and owner $5 million a year in income but\nis not growing very quickly, or a similar Web site\nbusiness that is growing rapidly, as fast as the\ntime of the sole proprietor permits.<p>Such an organically grown business might be the next\n&quot;big thing&quot;, worth $400+ billion, depending just on\nthe business, say, the Web site, how many users like\nit how much, and how much free cash flow the revenue\nfrom the ads generates.  In general we can&#x27;t say and\nhave to look at the particular business.<p>But, we can draw conclusions from what was common in\nthe past?  When looking for &quot;the next big thing&quot;\n(NBT), mostly just simple empirical patterns from\nthe past are next to useless, deliberately, even\nnearly necessarily, so since the NBT might be --\nshould be, likely is -- quite new and different.<p>So, again, when looking for NBT start ups, we have\nto consider them one at a time with little hope of\ngood help from past, simplistic patterns.",1372278035

[1]  And then, a month or so later, I found that the ad copy was making rounds on the usual job sites, having been adopted by a number of recruiters and companies wanting to hire programmers skilled at functional programming.<p>At first, I was angry.

If you write something and it&#x27;s on the Internet, it&#x27;s going to be plagiarized.<p>Unless it&#x27;s not worth plagiarizing.<p>But that bar is so low that, if you&#x27;re not hitting it, ...<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2011-07-10-good-enough-to-steal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2011-07-10-good-enough-to-stea...</a>",1372277154

A lot of this is anecdotal so take it for what it is.<p>Let&#x27;s rewind a generation or so and pretend to be our parents.  At a very basic level, looking around, I see a pattern of &quot;X went to college, and X has a better standard of living than I do&quot;.  Easy answer: college makes life better.  I want my kids to do that well, so I better get little Sally to go to college.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s entirely true or not, but I think that college has been the &quot;easy answer&quot; for a generation.  Somehow things like work-ethic, realistic career goals, etc. got lost along the way.<p>I hate the idea that &quot;if we go through college and get the degree, we&#x27;ll be all set in life.&quot;  Who has been saying that?  Anyone saying that is either lazy or worse.  All degrees were not created equal, and it seems that a surprising number of people either honestly thought all degrees were equally valuable or people simply didn&#x27;t put any thought into their career or life before signing up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans.<p>If we use the same analogy I had above, I think the &quot;if you go to college, you&#x27;ll be set&quot; is completely wrong.  20 years ago, the people who went to college were, in general, the more motivated set of people who actively sought to go to college.  They weren&#x27;t just following the prescribed plan, they actually were thinking about what they wanted to do with their lives, what they loved, how to achieve their goals.  Now that college is the &quot;default&quot;, everyone goes to college, it&#x27;s just expected.<p>Anyways, this whole thing wasn&#x27;t a bash on people who do and don&#x27;t go to college.  Of <i>course</i> there are going to be more taxi drivers with college degrees now:  a much higher percentage of people have college degrees now.  <i>Everyone</i> is expected and encouraged to go to college.  There are still going to be taxi drivers, bartenders and other such positions.",1372277050

A cnc system must have a timing resolution much finer than is available in traditional general purpose operating systems.<p>In general terms, a cnc system must convert high level instructions, like G-code, in to voltage pulses that are fed to either stepper or servo motors.<p>Some of these calculations are performed on the PC, others are performed on the dedicated hardware.  Do steps 1, 2, and 3, send step 3&#x27;s result over usb to the controller, then perform steps 4 through 10.<p>Not everyone agrees where to place that barrier.<p>In the case of GRBL, which is the firmware that runs most of these hobbyist level 3D printers, the entire process happens on an 8 bit microcontroller, from G-code to steps.<p>Other cnc systems perform almost all of the calculations on the PC, and sends a representation of the timing information to the controller.<p>Still other systems decode the G-code into vectors and other intermediate representations, and let the controller do most of the heavy lifting.<p>Some systems transmit their data over USB, a standard ill equipped for industrial environments or cable lengths more than about 10ft.  Others use ethernet.  I&#x27;m sure there are others that use RS-485, or even proprietary protocols.<p>Is Microsoft accounting for any of these variations, or are they going to standardize everyone to whats popular today, which is usb and 8 bit microcontrollers that can&#x27;t even create 50,000 steps per second?",1372277012

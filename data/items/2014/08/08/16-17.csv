It&#x27;s an essential feature -- imagine being the manager of 20,000 desktops when they all auto-update at once, consuming all the bandwidth, simultaneously stopping the work of every employee in the enterprise, creating hundreds or more support calls, and breaking the corporate intranet.<p>And yes, ESR editions update only to other ESR editions.",1407517183

When trying to learn some c++ and opengl, i totally see the need for good libraries, which abstract some of the initial verbose window and shader setup, its good to directly jump into manipulating\nvertices and stuff. They are needed because they hide the initially complex setup. \nBut in case of Javascript I really dont see why there needs to be another abstraction layer. The language itself is so easy, setting up a canvas is already handled well, and drawing to it is documented extensively.<p>Also in regards to the goals of p5.js (<a href=""https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js#how-is-this-different-than-processingjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js#how-is-this-different-than-...</a>):\n&quot;It is easy to translate a sketch from Processing to p5 and the process of doing so begins to teach people the basics of JS&quot;\nI dont really see how it would help teaching the basics of js, when the &#x27;framework&#x27; itself introduces stuff like global functions, constants and so, which are considered evil in js. On top of that i think that if you try to teach someone js by porting code from java, you have to teach the fact that js itself is total different beast. Just like u said, no classes in a traditional sense,\nwhere have all the types gone?... That fact that js is so perfect for &#x27;creative coding&#x27; is because of its dynamicness, the same reason why bindings for scripting languages are so popular in lower languages, you can just express an idea much faster and see changes immediatly. Yes a good framework can help with that, but I think that when learning js as a first language you have to be\naware of its advantages right from the beginning, and not by translating it from another language.<p>I just love paper.js way of dealing with javascripts dynamicness, paperscript introduces some neat additions to the language like operators <a href=""http://scratchdisk.com/posts/operator-overloading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratchdisk.com/posts/operator-overloading</a>\nI could totally imagine p5.js going the same way, accepting that the environment changed, not trying to port one opinion from another language to js, but instead think about the way\njavascript and its advantages can be used to create a new tool.",1407516336

I had a friend who took a 300-level (Junior) class as an elective and they introduced Vim/Emacs halfway through and tested on it...we were both amazed at that level many of them hadn&#x27;t even written much code, worked on a large code-base, or had a grasp on any programming paradigms/design patterns yet were getting a degree in a computer field in less than a year.

Probably not, especially if you have some projects under your belt to demonstrate your skills.

There is a reason these are 2 different programs at your school because they are aiming at teaching 2 different things. CS dives into theoretical components such as OS design, programming paradigms and design, algorithms, ect. Now you can learn all these on your own of course, but I find it far more difficult especially at a higher level of understanding. &quot;business informatics&quot; (as I understand it), is about putting software in place which is going to aid business in some way or possibly train you to be in some sort of &quot;software management&quot; position.<p>Just my 2 cents though.",1407516259

Instead of sharing that cost saving to the benefit of society they swallow it and add extra charges which undoes the benefits that the technological move has created. The only reason an ebook costs more than a paperback is greed; allowing the greedy to dictate access to arts (eg fiction books) and informational sources is not right IMO.<p>I&#x27;m not at all arguing that publishing houses can&#x27;t abuse the power but when they do like this it makes it hard to side against Amazon coming along to whip them in to line. The publishing houses could have set less greedy ebook prices first and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t then get to do their knight-in-shining-[consumer-championing]-armour act.<p>Ebook sellers may think you can&#x27;t resell but first-sale doctrine disagrees. Of course media companies are lobbying to ensure that such established doctrine get reinterpreted to their favour but that again is not acceptable.

If he sues for emotional distress, then it looks like a frivolous lawsuit (and his odds aren&#x27;t good). If he sues for detrimental reliance and can prove that he incurred expenses or lost job offers, it&#x27;s less damaging. It hurts your reputation to sue if (a) the suit can be made to look frivolous (which doesn&#x27;t mean that it is so; see &quot;Hot Coffee&quot;) or (b) embarrassing material would come into the public, as usually happens in a termination suit (even if the employee is in the right).<p>The reputation risk involved in a wrongful termination suit isn&#x27;t mainly the fact that the suit occurred. (That&#x27;s part of it.) It&#x27;s also the fact that the company is going to have ex-colleagues testifying (&quot;character witnesses&quot;, still employed by the firm being sued) and saying that the plaintiff&#x27;s work wasn&#x27;t any good.

Spain outlawed all forms of secret organizations, including the Freemasons.<p>The Mason’s plan was to redirect a fortune to the “New World” (North America), to enable the transfer of the Masonic organization, if and when these fears materialized.\nTheir plan entailed the capture of Havana in 1762.\nHavana’s Morro Castle was the Fort Knox of Spain, holding the South and Central America’s gold supply prior to its shipment to Spain.\nThe invasion of Havana was under the command of George Keppel, with Admiral George Pocock and Keppel’s two brothers Augustus and William Keppel, commanding the actual attack. They were successful with the capture of Havana and Fort Morro and its unprecedented amount of treasure. They also captured a number of the Spanish Fleet, which was needed to accomplish their plan. Accordingly, Admiral Pocock returned to England with the main English fleet carrying a portion of the treasure, while Augustus and William Keppel along with their crew and Masonic engineers all sworn to secrecy, manned the 8 Spanish Galleons and the 2 British Man of War. This treasure was diverted to a small island off the coast of New England and Nova Scotia now called Oak Island.<p>At Oak Island the treasure was buried based on the Masonic “Royal Arch” (Enoch’s Temple) consisting of nine arches going down nine levels by way of a main shaft (The Money Pit) which was dug down to the bedrock. From the ninth level another tunnel was constructed which ran back up to a point above the known water level, roughly 20 feet underground and at this point an enormous cavern was built to hold the treasure. The treasure was carted down the main shaft and placed up into this cavern. To conceal their plot they had the 8 Spanish ships dismantled with all the wooden parts not used in the construction of the shaft, tunnels and cavern burnt and all the metal parts (canons, anchors and bolts) were placed at the bottom of the main shaft. Flood tunnels were built out to the ocean to booby trap any treasure seekers attempts to follow down the main shaft. A large stone was placed at the air lock (8th level) as bait to activate the flooding. This stone had strange engravings on it to entice any unworthy treasure seekers to pause and take the bait (stone) away for deciphering, thus allowing time for the tunnels and main shaft to fill with water and be destroyed forever. The Masons knew exactly by their calculated mark above ground where the treasure cavern below ground was located, and could access it by digging down 20 feet.<p>Once the treasure was secured in the cavern and all the evidence was hidden from the island, it was documented that the Keppels sailed back to England with 2 ships and a small portion of the treasure. They claimed that the remainder of the fleet had sunk in a hurricane on route.<p>The Masons left several markers on the island to relocate the treasure.\n1 large triangle or more precisely a crude Sextant\n2 drilled holed stones\n1 large stone cross\nThese combined markers along with the Star Map are used to cross triangulate and a set degree on the sextant point to the “X” where the cavern is today located.<p>Is the treasure still in this cavern?<p>I believe it was removed in 1795<p>One of the three original discoverers of the Money Pit was Daniel McGinnis, who stated he was drawn to the island when he noticed strange lights appearing on the island just prior to his discovery. \nThese lights were made by the Freemasons when they returned for their treasure.\nThis Masonic party was headed up by George Washington, President of the United States – acting Grand Master of the Washington DC Masons.<p>The treasure’s vast fortune was used, as planned, to further the power of the Freemasons in their new world, with them becoming “The New World Order”.",1407515237

There is also a very interesting contrast between following a link (so the previous page is available on the Back button, and therefore either accessed right away or soon forgotten) versus opening it in a new tab (so the parent remains visible as a remainder of an interesting place or a branching point in the navigation).<p>I can&#x27;t even operate without tree-style tabs anymore. They make it really easy to organize my thoughts, activities,  and the current state of any investigation that I&#x27;m on.<p>They tend to start with a search, then all interesting links opened as leaves, then pruning happens, then finding the most comprehensive leaf and promoting it first leaf, then deleting the (search) root to make the most general leaf the new root.<p>Some leaves then end up becoming branches as I move leaves beneath them, and I may find old tabs or trees than may get moved into this tree. The final leaves usually end up being the most concrete pages - manual pages, product listings, specific vendor options, etc.<p>I keep these open until whatever I was working on or investigating is complete, or if other things get in the way, I can archive them by bookmarking the <i>entire tree</i> and giving it an appropriate folder name.<p>I get the suggestion that window managers could handle this, but I don&#x27;t know of any window managers that handle tree-style tabs and bookmarks like that, and anything else at this point feels like a step back.",1407514878

It seems to be context dependent. (I&#x27;m using what I consider the &quot;standard&quot;, loose definitions of safety and progress: safety means the program will not go wrong, bad things won&#x27;t happen; progress means the program will perform correctly, good things will (eventually?) happen.<p>For example, consider a program involving binary search on an array. Clearly, &quot;does not access elements outside the bounds of the array&quot; is a good safety property, but what is the status of &quot;if the array is sorted, the search will correctly find a matching element or report that none exists&quot;? It looks like a progress property, but depending on how the results are used I can see how it would become a safety problem. (I think; I&#x27;m still undecided on that point.)",1407514355

This can look at lot like &quot;you will still fail&quot;.</i><p>Seems to me you&#x27;re saying pretty much the same thing as the post I replied to earlier.  The point, as I see it, is that while what you say is true, it is still the case that some kids who see evidence which would <i>seem</i> to support a conclusion of &quot;you will fail&quot; still manage to go on to greater success than their parents.<p>The question in my mind, then, is &quot;why&quot;?  What results in the &quot;unreasonable&quot; kids who say &quot;screw the odds, screw fate, I&#x27;m doing this anyway&quot;, despite the evidence?<p>As far as looking at it from a parent&#x27;s perspective... I don&#x27;t have kids, so I haven&#x27;t thought about it much from that angle.  But I think if I ever have kids, I&#x27;ll want to teach them a lot of the same basic lessons my parents taught me, including &quot;work hard and you can achieve anything you want&quot;.  Note, of course, that &quot;can&quot; != &quot;will&quot;.  But I think kids are smart enough to understand that sometimes bad/unexpected things can happen, and that sometimes even when you &quot;do everything right&quot; external factors can knock you off the rails.   The important thing there, IMO, is the attitude of &quot;it&#x27;s not how many times you get knocked down, it&#x27;s how many times you get back up&quot;.",1407513731

Barely enough time to load up a stock file, slap some text on it in Illustrator, make some default gradients, and call it a day. And that&#x27;s exactly what you get.<p>Cheap things are cheap because 1) they take very little materials/labor to make, or 2) they cost a lot to make, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and the cost is spread over many duplicates.<p>In this case, you&#x27;re getting the latter, obviously. And you get what you pay for. I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re the kind of person who thinks paying for a $5 logo or $300 logo is good enough, you might as well learn Illustrator yourself and whip something easy out, since it will satisfy your two constraints: 1) it&#x27;s cheap/free, and 2) it looks okay to you but not to anyone else, but that&#x27;s fine, because the $5 logo would have performed the same role anyways.<p>This is like asking: &quot;What kind of branding do you get for $5?&quot; &quot;What kind of a PR rep do you get for $5?&quot; Etc, etc.",1407513695

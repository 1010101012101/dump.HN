It's never taken off on a large scale; I'm guessing the economics don't work. With cameras, at a store like B&H, you do see employees who are at least nominally more knowledgable about specific brands and won't, in fact, give you opinions between brands. And large photo stores often have days when manufacturers' reps are on hand to answer questions. Of course, this sort of model is far more the exception than the rule. Sales specialists are expensive and it's hard to justify them on low-margin consumer items.",1323207813

3321210,comment,3321054,3321054,24,0,jerf,,,"Opinion: The thing that has saved the American school system is that everyone around the world has fully copied the deeply flawed Prussian schooling model, and in many cases has doubled down on the flaws. Higher performing schools are often ""teaching to the test"" <i>even worse</i> than we are, which is how they get measured as ""higher performing"" in the first place.<p>If the Prussian model is soooo spectacularly wonderful, then you have nothing to fear from it being exposed to a competitive environment. It'll win. No worries.<p>On the other hand, if the Prussian model is, shall we say, <i>less than optimal</i> for the 21st century, the fastest way to find out is free market experimentation, and rather than giving ourselves the same cultural shackles that everybody else has, the American exceptionalism that will justify our salaries will be our willingness to experiment, learn, and refine from there where everybody else insists on the Prussian model. Unless, of course, a 19th century schooling model is just <i>so damned perfect</i> that it will admit of no significant improvement. In which case we'll still find that out pretty quickly. The maximum downside is sharply bounded and the upside of cracking open the monopoly on education is hard to bound. (I can't call it ""unbounded"" with a straight face, that's hard to justify, but it really is hard to know how much better truly 21st schooling could be.) Failing to at least <i>try</i> some innovation isn't even remotely justified with a cost/benefit risk profile like that.<p>Had some other country beat us to the punch and exposed their schooling system to free market competition before us, we really <i>would</i> be up the creek without a paddle.",1323207760

They insist that all teachers have in-depth knowledge of the subjects they will teach, apprenticing new teachers to master teachers and raising teacher pay to that of other high-status professions."" This is a basically correct description about teacher selection and teacher professional development in several countries with schools that outperform schools in the United States. One way that teachers have the time to meet with more experienced teachers during the school day for mentoring and discussion of lesson plans is by setting higher class sizes. If the staffing ratio of a school (total teachers hired per enrolled pupils) is roughly the same in two countries, but in one country class sizes are larger, the teacher will have time during the school day to do lesson preparation in collaboration with other teachers.

I was trying to suggest a vengeful motive after they had been fired.<p>> What is your basis for estimating the probability of such blackmail as ""very likely""?<p>Basic human nature. If you're directly employing people whose job is clearly unethical then you're painting yourself into a corner. Either they do in fact <i>actively</i> blackmail you or else you will feel unable to fire them in case they start telling people what you're up to - I'm regarding this implicit threat as <i>passive</i> blackmail here.<p>I agree with you that there are lots of people who seem perfectly happy to do unethical or illegal things in order to make a living. They calculate (if not always very accurately) that the potential gains outweigh the potential costs.<p>However, a lot of these people make such a decision in light of particular circumstances e.g. their low intelligence, or their lack of employability (due in part perhaps to an existing criminal record), or their unwillingness to work.<p>Someone who has established a business that is making enough money to pay the bills should clearly be reaching a different conclusion to these sorts of people (at least most of the time). Their potential losses are much higher (i.e. loss of the business) and the potential gains are actually not all that favourable compared to doing things the ""right way"" - for example, by hiring a developer who can boost your business in other ways.<p>> But even the business receives many positive reviews in a short period of time, that's not proof the reviews were fake.<p>It's evidence. What a business owner might do if they suspected a competitor had hired someone to ""opinion spam"" is up to them. If they though a competitor was paying someone to post negative reviews of their own business then they could very well sue, and request access logs etc. from the review site in order to further the investigation.<p>> Are there any such services which claim to be able to detect fake reviews?<p>I haven't looked.

However, everyone take the easy way out by closing down on mission critical and open source the rest.<p>I thought of a possible solution that allow everyone to charge an arm and leg while still being open source, or even public domain. Mainly, I am inspired by the kickstarter idea, but I am less interested in curating projects for one time event and more interested in business model automation.<p>Here how it would works:<p>You have a webcomic and you have an ever expanding archive of past comic strips. However, the next comic strip, already finished, is not available. To make the comic strip available, you ask for a collective donation of 100 dollars. Some donate 1 dollars, others 20 dollars, until the money is raised. This ensure that you will get paid every step of the way while your comic archive acts as advertising.<p>The value for my users is the automation of numerous drudgery involved with the business model. That included tracking who donate what, tracking the deadline, the release, and so on. With an API for the service, people can get especially creative with how they release, or how they incentivize their customers.<p>Another twist to this idea is sponsorship by advertisers and allowing advertisers getting involved with the fundraising process. They can aid the fundraising in either matching user donations or offering discounts.<p>Of course, this will be just another idea if nobody took any effort in building the service and nobody will attempt this business model, easily. I am working on it, but it's more of a half-baked project on some private repos somewhere rather than a serious startup.",1323206468

Even in the good OpenCourseWare lectures, or similar videos from Stanford, at least half the video is wasted time.<p>I was pretty excited when videos of real classes from respected universities became available online for free. I have watched quite a few from places like MIT and Stanford. One unexpected result I've had is that I have been mostly unimpressed. The lectures were not better than the lectures I went to at the no-name college I attended. My conclusion is that college lectures really aren't an efficient way to disseminate education, and they are even less so when they are recorded on video.

For much of the world, $500 is a lot of money to spend on a tablet, especially for those outside the United States.

Granted, they're basing it on DNSCurve so at least a few other people have looked at the design, but the implementation is custom... I wouldn't touch this with a 50 foot pole until a dozen PhDs vet it.<p><i>edit</i> I didn't notice libnacl is provided, so I assume a good chunk of the crypto work is done by this. My comments were probably too harsh. But I would still like to see a professional look over the rest of their code to make sure there's no glaring problems.",1323205221

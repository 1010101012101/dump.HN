9485558,comment,9484939,9484939,0,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"> Well, after a little over six years of development, we discovered that we were never going to see a PHP 6 at all. Having seen how long Perl 6 had taken, and how long PHP 6 was taking, the number 6 is associated with failure. So they cancelled PHP 6 and voted to change the name to PHP 7.<p>Uh, what? Did the author do the most <i>basic</i> of research?<p>PHP 6 was a real thing, a development branch. But it dragged on for years.<p>Due to delays, they made an interim release in the 5.x series, PHP 5.3. It backported some stuff from 6.<p>Eventually, PHP 6 was killed off because it just wasn&#x27;t going to work. So they made another 5.x release, PHP 5.4, backporting more stuff from 6, and adding some other features.<p>After that, with PHP 6 dead and gone, work focussed on the PHP 5.x series again. So out came PHP 5.5 (2013) and PHP 5.6 (2014).<p>During this time, some people did some experiments and realised it was possible, by breaking internal (not userland) compatibility, to greatly improve PHP&#x27;s performance. This project became phpng. Since it would break so many (internal) things, they decided that if it should be merged into PHP, it needed to go into a new major version.<p>It was after this that the ridiculous version number vote was held. I don&#x27;t see why we ever had that debate, really. PHP 6 was a thing and was killed off, re-using the version number was silly. Anyway, the number chosen was PHP 7.<p>Fast forward to the present day: PHP 7 has gone into feature freeze and should be released in a few months. Alongside the performance improvements of phpng, it has some other new features developed independently, and includes a few deliberate backwards-compatibility breaks.<p>tl;dr: the time line goes: 5.2 release, work begins on 6.0, 5.3 release, 6.0 killed off, 5.4 release, 5.5 release, 5.6 release, 7.0 in development.<p>Edit:<p>> JIT to the Zend engine<p>...what? No, PHP 7 does not have that.<p>> Asynchronous IO and functions<p>...PHP 7 doesn&#x27;t have that either?<p>> Standalone Multi-threading Web Server (HHVM)<p>...huh?<p>> phpclasses.org<p>Oh, so that&#x27;s why the author is so confused.",1430740178

9485556,comment,9484939,9485361,0,0,SudoAlex,,,"Libraries are a problem - it&#x27;s difficult to switch unless <i>all</i> your dependencies are Python 3 compatible. The only ways to fix it are to either use an alternative, or perhaps to fork or contribute patches to the project - both of which take up valuable time when your code is still functional under 2.7.<p>I&#x27;m currently creating 2.7/3.3+ compatible code in whatever I create, but I&#x27;m still deploying to 2.7 hosts. For most of my projects this is due to just one package which has some Python 3 related bugs, so hopefully I can just flick the switch soon and use 3.4.<p>It&#x27;s only easy when your project depends on a few popular packages (eg. the top 200 where 86% are currently Python 3 compatible [1]), it&#x27;s much more difficult if you&#x27;ve got a long list of dependencies.<p>[1] <a href=""https://python3wos.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://python3wos.appspot.com/</a>",1430740112

In the real world, adoption is not only driven by how cool a language is, but the ecosystem of tools and developers around it. There are lots of Perl 5 codebases which won&#x27;t be migrated because it&#x27;s too expensive.<p>The true lesson learned for language developers is: Don&#x27;t break backwards compatibility. Ever.<p>The Python community made this mistake, and they acknowledge it. Guido said this won&#x27;t happen again. But at least for the case of Python 3, the number of breakages is relatively small, and the migration from 2 to 3 while tedious, it&#x27;s not that hard. Even so, the migration of the whole ecosystem has been really really slow. But I think in the end the community will move.<p>The Perl case, on the other side, is much worse. Migrating a relatively complex project from 5 to 6 is extraordinarily hard. It&#x27;s probably the same as a whole rewrite. Also, the community is divided, with some developers keeping the improvement of Perl 5, fixing bugs and adding new features. There is no incentive for migration.<p>If the migration has been so slow for Python 3, which had a much smaller barrier, I don&#x27;t see how it could be better for Perl 6.<p>New languages are able to develop a new ecosystem when they introduce innovative features, e.g. Rust. But Perl 6 while being a nice language, doesn&#x27;t seem to have any killer feature compared to mainstream languages.",1430740059

SQL projects are stored in source control as though they were C++/C#/what-have-you.

A policy of using SPROCs only is a good way to significantly reduce the risk of SQL-related vulnerabilities.

In a previous post I have worked out how to articulate my concerns: A lot of the time posts with an overtly negative tone that claim to come from a place of rationality, are in fact reactionary. They claim to be defending a core of rationality from encroaching confusion, when in fact they are a symptom of irrationality, a result of the innapropriate application of emotional reasoning to areas of life where it has no explicative power. I believe that the rigidity of the models to be found within the minds of certain kinds of folks has less to do with the defense of rationality and more to do with the defense of identity. I find it extremely irritating to deal with people who are irrationally certain in an uncertain world  - especially when they justify themselves by claiming they are just being more reasoned than the next man.

Then saying I found their observations to be inconsistent with how I expect the world to behave given my model. A natural follow on step from this is to conclude that they have missunderstood how their experiment is constructed - there is something about the way they are performing their experiment which is not accurately reflected in the model of their experiment. For instance there might in fact be conventional exhaust escaping from the device in a manner they had not anticipated. This is fine, this is also my interpretation. But where we differ is that I am very able to imagine a world where my model is innacurate and I appreciate that sometimes things that appear to require radically different models can in fact be produced by relatively minor ammendments. And that many people I meet seem to be very unwilling to question their own models and ammend them where necessary, upsets me. It upsets me because I believe in many instances it is born of the same kinds of irrationality that the whole enterprise of rational thought was designed to fix in the first place. At times, to me, it feels like it has become just another church for people to cling to. The rigid models I percieve within public discourse on these topics are a symptom of the very same creeping irrationality that they are purportedly defending against.",1430737392

Are you going to change them all at once again and take another 15 years for Perl 7?</i><p>Learning from experience, one of the design goals of Perl6 was the ability gracefully evolve. Thus you get an object system with meta-object protcol, and you can extend the syntax through user-defined grammars. This probably also factored into the decision to have Rakudo support multiple backends.",1430737308

8871282,comment,8870934,8871153,0,0,crdb,,,"My first &quot;startup&quot; was a Rocket Internet company where I knew I&#x27;d have little career future, that my pay would be way below market, and that I&#x27;d get no equity (I was fortunate that the person who recruited me was upfront about it). Three years and two more RI ventures later, I&#x27;ve observed enough and figured out what to learn, learnt it and even found both my market and co-founders. This happened because of the breadth of work that needs to get done in a startup/&quot;small underfunded mostly online company&quot; and the lack of people available to do it, meaning little bureaucracy and much more responsibility, with immediate feedback from the real world on your performance.<p>Career switches are hard and sometimes, starting at the bottom again, risk included, can be worthwhile. I do agree with you that few people hired as &quot;employees&quot; should expect to &quot;get rich&quot;. But provided you are willing to observe and learn, especially learn what to learn, it can still be worth it, even just to see what a hyped up &quot;5-at-a-time&quot; startup looks like from the inside and the signs of what to avoid.",1421009951

That way the network can be trained to do different tasks and then put back into those modes by setting those training connections to various values during runtime:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIURAu1-aU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIURAu1-aU</a><p>Eventually another neural net could be trained to know which values to hold to get different behaviors.  It sounds like one of the goals is to reuse logic for similar tasks, and eventually be able to adapt in novel situations like our brains do.  I believe there was also a bit about how time figured into all of this, but I haven’t watched it for a while.<p>Anyway, I’m thinking that a lot of what we’ve learned about version control systems like git could be used to let an AI brainstorm in a sandbox and replace its own code as it improves, and always be able to revert or merge if needed.  Throw in some genetic programming and decent lisp machines with 1000 cores and we could really have something.<p>When I think about this sort of “real work”, as opposed to the daily minutia our industry gets mired in, it makes me sad inside.",1421009945

That, or she wishes she&#x27;d had better challenges out of college, ones that she still could have completed, though (rather than just taken a job at a startup yet failed to be productive at it). The problem is that the former is impossible to pick, and the latter isn&#x27;t guaranteed just because you joined a startup.<p>You should be picking a job at a startup with the assumption that the startup will fail. Is this particular startup opportunity you&#x27;re looking at (not &#x27;it&#x27;s a startup!&#x27;, but, &#x27;it&#x27;s a chance to work at X, using technologies Y, with team members of Z, management seems good, the environment seems good, the compensation is good enough&#x27;) worth it, given that?<p>And if you take it, periodically ask, given this startup will fail (take that attitude, even if things are beginning to look positive), is the environment still worth it?<p>The fact it&#x27;s a startup, the fact it includes equity, are -terrible- reasons to stay at a job that you aren&#x27;t growing in and learning to enjoy.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced good enterprise jobs, where I felt I had a massive say in what technologies were used, in what tasks we prioritized, and felt extremely responsible to get things done, to where I felt I was constantly learning, and better yet, felt incentivized to go learn more on my own. I felt that my efforts were recognized, that my management gave a damn, and that collectively my department was effective, and supportive, and that my time was respected.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced bad startup jobs, where I felt micromanaged, that I had no say, that my tasks were constantly shifting and never under my own control, and that the existing cruft from prior pivots was so large that I had no real freedom to experiment or expand into the areas other people, who were more knowledgeable about the code, were working in, and by the time I left I felt I had learned nothing, and felt so drained at the end of the day I had no inclination to do anything on getting home. I felt unrecognized, viewed largely as a useful code monkey, that my time was not respected, and that collectively everyone was just in it for the paycheck and the hope of an eventual payout of their equity.<p>Take articles like this as reasons to consider a startup, but NOT as &quot;startups are better&quot;. Just because something is a startup is not a reason to take it, just as it&#x27;s not a reason to dismiss it.

1802668,comment,1802203,1802562,0,0,dhess,,,"I was just reading about extrinsic motivators today in the book, <i>What the Best College Teachers Do</i>. The research cited there dates back to the 1970s and the work of Edward L. Deci. Apparently what he and his colleagues found is that most extrinsic motivators (money, prizes, grades) actually do work as long as they continue to be applied, but their effect on motivation or engagement is lost once the extrinsic motivator is removed; and, in fact, application of an extrinsic motivator appears to weaken any intrinsic motivation that existed before the extrinsic motivator was applied.<p>This theory has ramifications not only for paying students to go to school, or for good performance, but also whether grades are ultimately harmful to long-term student learning and comprehension. The research suggests that students who perceive getting good grades as a reward for studying tend to view learning as a performance or competition, not as a quest for mastery or self-fulfillment. When they graduate into the real world and are no longer rewarded with grades, they tend to stop learning, because the extrinsic motivator (grades) is removed. They also tend to ""study for the test"" and forget the lessons soon after, as the goal is always to perform well on the next exam, not to retain knowledge.<p>Not all extrinsic motivators appear to be damaging to intrinsic motivation. For example, the researchers (and those who have continued Deci's work) found that encouragement and praise were extrinsic motivators that often reinforce, or at least sustain, intrinsic motivation. The theory is that people (especially children) lose intrinsic motivation if they think they're being manipulated by the external reward: verbal encouragement and social acceptance are supposedly less transparent means of motivation than, say, money or grades.<p>Before reading this part of the book, I had thought that perhaps paying students for good academic performance was a good idea. Now I wonder if perhaps paying <i>parents</i> for their child's good performance is the right way to go, accompanied by a short course on developmental psychology for the parents.",1287387850

I learned a lot of interdisciplinary stuff, and I thought those combinations would easily land me at least a ~40k job doing something (programming, electronics stuff, whatever).  Turned out I was wrong, and I couldn't find a job anywhere in my hometown (even though I could run circles around any of the new CS grads in most languages)  I learned a hard lesson that I thought would haunt me for the next decade:  People don't want to hire scientists, they only want engineers.  I got a shitty $15/hr part time job as a test tech, got sick of that and then realized I couldn't get into grad school for financial reasons.  I had a bit of money so I applied only to physics jobs at high profile schools or labs across the country (partially motivated by this site, actually).  Within a week I got an email back from Stanford (SLAC) to do an interview for a developer.  It turned out that I had all the right kinds of experience, and I just started last Thursday at what can only be described as the perfect job for me right now.<p>I think most companies these days just overlook the value of research, basic science, and scientists in favor of marketing, products, and engineers.

You said ""How many husbands have killed their wives (or vice versa) in the last 9 years? We should ban marriage and investigate the religions that promote it!!"". You were clearly trying to make me look bad by using heavy sarcasm to draw a parallel between the number of deaths caused by spousal murders vs the 9/11 attack.  But it's a very bad comparison because murder is not a fundamental property of marriage. No one gets married in order to murder their spouse, or murders their spouse to bring glory to marriage.  On the other hand, jihad terrorism is a defining property of the brand of Islam practiced by the 9/11 attackers and thousands of other people throughout the world.<p>Nihilism is the rejection of meaning, and if you can't see that the 9/11 attacks had meaning well beyond the death toll, both to the attackers and the victims - and I'm not talking about the reactions to the event - then you're a nihilist.  It was an unprecedented military-style mass murder of civilians by organized, motivated enemies who also had their own set of beliefs.

The point in the article about how they desire to foster intrinsic motivation with extrinsic rewards made me do a double take. Yet the solution still isn't ""let the students do what they want"", because most will do the minimum, and then schools will cut budgets and staff, and with only ""generalist"" teachers you get generally shallow teachers across all subjects. I'll agree that some teachers can teach more subjects than one and many classes can benefit from a mixture that only a special generalist could adequately teach (it always bugs me when math teachers admit their ignorance on the uses of complex numbers), but we really need specialists.

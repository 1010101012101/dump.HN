2855109,comment,2848239,2854372,1,0,sausagefeet,,,"Nobody said C10K is the end-all-be-all on scaling, nor should it be.  It is also false that it doesn't present any arguments for why threads don't scale well.  According to the change log the latest change was 2011 which added information on nginx, but the last change prior to that was 2006.  That version of the document talks about memory limitations on using threads because of the stack size.  While not extensive it also includes a quote from Drepper about context switches.  It even points to documents that are pro-threading.  My point is that it's been around for 12 years and is easily found and read by anyone.  It also contains a plethora if links to more information on the subject.  To claim that C10K is not a useful educational document is absurd.  But C10K is one document, there are numerous ones out there, a google search away, our knowledge of scaling has anything but stagnated in the last 12 years.  Your options aren't C10K or read the kernel source for your favorite OS.<p>If you're going to argue that those with knowledge need to distribute that knowledge better, that's fine.  Knowledge can almost always be distributed better, perhaps someone could make a nice centralized website that has better information than highscalability.com.  But at the same time you've just told me that a document that is a great introductory resource on scaling connection handling is not a ""useful educational document"".  You may have better things to do with your time than read kernel source, but is your time so precious you can't do some google searches?  Perhaps read an industrial white paper or academic paper on the subject of scalability?  You can write all the software you want but if you're ignorant of how to overcome scalability problems are you accomplishing much?  And if you're doing tests and learning about what scales but keeping it to yourself you are just as culpable of not educating people.",1312671068

Googrosoft-style interviews are great for selecting people with raw intelligence, a competitive streak and some level of arrogance.

2855098,comment,2853652,2854408,3,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>An environment shouldn't enforce thinking for the sake of learning.</i><p>I agree.  However, I'm not sure the environment should bend over backwards to not make you learn.  Probably depends on both the task at hand and the user. If only I could extract some generally useful heuristic<p>Photoshop is an inherently graphical application, because (i) it works on images, and (ii) it is essentially an interactive program.  If however I suddenly wanted to do <i>automatic</i> image processing, I would very much like to have access to some programmatic interface, most probably batch sub-programs that one could pipe together from the shell.<p>> <i>Your subtitle editing case is specifically a command-line one</i><p>Yep.  My point was, those cases exist, though I recognize the GUI is sometimes equally useful, if not outright superior.  But the problem of GUI-only environments (and Windows specifically) is that if you don't even know what is a command line, you can't think of CLI tasks as CLI tasks.  In my example, my first reflex was ""sed"", followed by ""crap, Windows"".  On the other hand, a purely GUI user would have a ""does a program does this?"" reflex if he has any reflex at all.<p>GUIs make it very hard to combine programs.  So in practice, they don't.  They don't even tell the user about this concept.  Instead, they tell the user that functionality is <i>given from above</i>.  If no program does this, you're out of luck.  I fear this contributes to the sense of helplessness of many users.  CLI, on the other hand, quickly makes very clear that programs can be combined, that 5 lines scripts can be very useful.  Sure, there will be a point beyond which one will need the help of a geek friend.  But he would at least <i>think</i> of calling her.<p>Another point where GUIs easily fail hard is user customization.  GUI programs tend to embed every functionality, leaving very little for external programs.  For instance, Emacs or vi won't replace the built-in editing functionality of Thunderbird or Firefox (barring dedicated extensions).  So I'm kinda stuck with the defaults.",1312670711

If you make cuts on larger expenditures, the end result will be a discussion of really tiny posts.<p>As an example, let's say you decide to cut 30% on defense. You cannot realistically do that by deciding to drop, say, the navy. There are lots of dependencies to consider (does it make sense to have marines, but no navy? Should we perhaps keep a small part of the navy for supporting the marines? What part? Can the air force maintain a global presence without carriers? If not, how many carriers do we really need? Can those carriers do without other ships for protection? Etc) People in charge will delegate filling in the details and suggesting a coherent set of cuts to subordinates.<p>After a few levels of such delegation, people will be talking about such 0.5% items.

And don't even get me started on non-technical skills, like being able to organize and plan the work, communicate with non-technical people etcetera.<p>Basically, I don't see this kind of testing covering more than 5% of the screening effort.",1312668897

We tend to be like cats - very fascinated for short periods of time but unwilling to listen to non-technical direction issued by a bunch of MBA's.<p>It's far easier - for a non-technical person - to assemble a horde of average developers using a pre-packaged toolkit (Java, Microsoft, SAP, or enterprise software packages) and boss them through some form of digitized process map. Let them hire a bunch of their B-school buddies at ACN or Mckinsey to ""faciliate"" the deployment, for $300 - $500 per hour, and it's a lock.<p>Big companies don't care about technical excellence  - they care about ensuring the company, not the developer, controls the code. The truth of the matter - developers are not created equal and you will get a lot farther in a small group if you let your best person carry the ball.<p>Unfortunately we're comparing archers and crossbowmen - the archer took YEARS to train but delivered (for his time) an awesome rate of fire with good accuracy.

 - Allow the recruiter to decide what he's looking for in the code. e.g. Complexity / Efficiency / Clean maintainable code / OO Principles, etc.<p>The biggest problem I have with job interview style 'coding puzzles' - is that the code that is optimum to solving the solution is actually not code I would want to write day to day and wouldn't be code I would want to work with day to day.<p>The reason is because in my line of work, we are working with good clean, maintainable code, using good OO principles. This includes naming of variables, naming of functions and accounting for extendibility and maintainability from the ground up.<p>However, most of these coding puzzles, will be looking for people to write the 'simplest' / 'most elegant' solution to the problem, often leaning towards efficiency or using the least number of lines / characters.<p>For example, the variables will be 'x', 'y', 'a', 'b', everything will be manipulated through integer 'index' and complex reg exp's may often feature as short cuts to longer code.<p>- Now there's nothing wrong with the solution this produces. However, overall coding style I prefer is maintainable and easily readable. Variable names have meaning, we work with concrete objects and each piece of complexity is broken into separate functions / classes.<p>Neither solution is wrong, but the approach to either is completely different and for a interviewee it's often hard to know which path I should be treading when writing the sample code.<p>On the one hand, the interviewer may think I lack any forethought of maintainability / readability, if I just hack together something quickly using single character variables.<p>On the other hand, the interviewer may think I'm adding too much bloat / taking too long by using full naming and creating my objects to handle what I want to achieve.",1312668752

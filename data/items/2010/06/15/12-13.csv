Which would make the trade a horrible one. Consider, 188 young hungry twenty to thirty five year old men and women, for 151 forty to fifty year old men and women. I think if I'm Atlanta, I'm comfortable with that trade.<p>I think the Southern cities are doing a good job attracting a more youthful demographic. Click on Harris County in Texas, (Houston). I think it is probably the 'blackest' on the map. Most of the people moving there have lower incomes. Yet at the same time they just elected an openly lesbian woman, with an adopted black daughter as mayor. I think there is a lot of evidence like this that massive numbers of young, hungry and educated people are probably moving in to Houston.<p>And yet.<p>I think the best places to move to, are probably the ones that everyone else is moving from. For instance, I would wager that the blacks and whites moving in to the Detroit area are of a higher economic quality than the blacks and whites moving out of the Detroit area.<p>Your material point is correct however. We need more information to make any determinations about whether what the map tells us is promising or troubling in economic terms. I would just expand the information you cited to include more than just income. In fact, I think it is more important to know age and educational level.",1276606417

But the impression they make, as a whole, is one of parents who failed to set limits for their child, either because the weirdness of his syndrome (and possibly guilt) made them afraid to intervene, or because they were so taken by his hormonal and intellectual maturity that they didn’t recognize that he had the social skills of, well, a nine-year-old.<p>Yeah, limits can be negotiated, and testing limits is a normal part of adolescence, but the parents have a right and a duty to negotiate from the other side, not just surrender.<p>(I have three sons, aged seven, five, and three, who don’t know how lucky they are to be cute.)",1276606310

When I logged into my Paypal account, the system thought I was someone else and blocked my account to prevent stealing.<p>No problem with that for me, it's a security measure I can understand. I had to unlock the account and here is where the pain began.<p>Logging into my account to provide my information (ID, proof of residence, etc) I was always brought to a page asking me to verify the IBAN of my bank account.

But trying later never worked, the error was always there, preventing me to unlock my account.<p>I started writing the support. They answered that I had to fill in my information to unlock my account. I told them that I could not do it because there was an internal error. They kept answering that I had to fill in my information to unlock it. This went on for a couple of weeks. What really pissed me off was that every time they answered (the support guy was always different), they always told me the same things, like they were not reading my emails at all.<p>I tried to call the support phone number for my country. There was an automatic voice with some steps to follow, including getting some authentication code for my account from the website. After all that, the automatic voice reminded me that my account was locked, as if I did not know that already. I never managed to speak with someone in person. That was the last drop, since loosing those 300$ would not have ruined my life, I switched to Fastspring never to come back.

Ahh, pieces are falling into place: 700 orders shipped out of a few thousand, some customers complained (love that tech induced ADHD), Google froze the money.<p>While it isn't immediately helpful to you, a little bit of craftiness here will kill two birds with one stone.  First, <i>don't let orders queue</i>.  Customers, particularly ADHD tech types, are <i>very</i> sensitive to shipping delays.  Instead, if you don't have the inventory and you're at your (low) maximum queue size, turn off orders on the website.<p>The key, though, is how you do that.

This is a luxury status item.  Tell folks that if they didn't buy in time, they're simply not worthy of your magical goodness.  Then three weeks later, you produce some more, and open orders again.  You will be stampeded, and have to close again within a day.  Folks who didn't hear about it in time, well, not everybody can be cool enough to own this.  (Every time you open up orders, expect a burst of Twitter/links/etc, as folks try to get in and then lament that they missed it again or primp to their friends that their faith has been rewarded.)<p>(I'd suggest making the batches distinguishable in some way -- any way, heck, you could just say ""Our artists whispered the words 'Made in the second batch' over these"" and that would have the desired effect on your target customer.

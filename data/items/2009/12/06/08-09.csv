979344,comment,978910,979117,0,0,amackera,,,"The ""orthogonal core"" is <i>not</i> only of interest to the language implementer, it is what determines the suitability of the language for the particular task. To use your analogy of harmonic analysis, a complete basis is not only useful as a method of representation, but also a method by which to ease the process of calculation.<p>Regardless, I think the post is postulating that a large, overcomplete ""basis"" is the new beauty de jour.",1260089830

This is absolutely true, and might be the reason Android gets some traction in Japan. But consider the implications of this for the user -- why is it that you think that Android is a ""good"" OS, something that you'd want on your own phone? ""It's open and I can do whatever I want with it""? Well, not after the Japanese carriers have their way with it.",1260089095

It's also the language that people feel they can code without knowing -- hence all the shoddy JS out there.

979321,comment,978156,978732,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"As a musician (one who, admittedly, wound up owing money when the bar tab was subtracted from the gate) I can't think of a better place to put them. They actually live on a line just south of the Sinatra-Beatles meridian. If you look just southwest of Sinatra, you'll see that Cab Calloway lives on the true line, with Count Basie just to the left. This would be the ""dirty"", less polished, and less, well, white version of the Sinatra-Beatles line (which would probably extend westward to Paul Whiteman if he appeared on the map at all).<p>No, the one that puzzles me is Sarah Brightman. I can understand them trying to keep her away from the cool kids, but she's got to be feeling like she got off the bus in the wrong neighborhood.<p>The style of music the Blues Brothers played, the Stax sound, cuts the continuum running from jazz-influenced big band risqué pop to straight-ahead risqué rock and roll. The rhythm section is from the rock world -- electric bass, guitar and piano, with foursquare beat-keeping drumming (as opposed to the sort of thing that, say, a Buddy Rich would do) -- the vocal performances are clearly in the Calloway-Prima-Charles lineage, and the horns are pure big band pop.",1260087103
979320,comment,979293,979293,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"Interesting article. The author would benefit from reading (if they haven't already) some of Jung's (C.G. Jung) work on the collective unconcious and the archetypes that our psyches interact with. Artists do nothing more but tap into collective archetypes, symbols, and motifs - shaping them, clothing them, and casting them in the light of that craftsman's psyche. This is why people find such work captivating, both intellectually and emotionally.<p>Old mythos were no different but simply a facade over the fundamental (archetypal) drama that plays out within our psyche. The emotional power of Romeo and Juliet or Tristan and Isolde are other good examples too.<p>Genius is, to me, the ability to <i>gen</i>erate from one's own unique psychic (mental) configuration a model of their interpretation of a pattern, system, archetype, or motif true to the valuing meme their mind operates within at that time. Many see it as ""exceptional"" (the dictionary even uses it that way), something measured by the precepts of what is considered average; I prefer the concept of true self-expression as guided and judged by true self-knowledge. Genius is then innate and accessible to anyone willing to cultivate a defining personal purpose, skills, and talents; to introspect upon the questions of ""who are you"", ""what do you want"", and ""why are you here"".<p>I know this comment is a bit of a tangent for Hacker News as it has delved into psychology and a bit of philosophy. I find it relevant though, even if tangentially, because we programmers (esp. hackers) have a knack for holistic and systemic thinking. The two qualities that comprise genius.<p>EDIT: In my first paragraph, I don't mean to down-play the artist's creative ability, toil, and skill that goes into creating a piece of work.",1260087103

But, like I said, it was just the last straw.<p>And if I am going to have a last straw, the thing that removes that piece of straw must be eccentric. Yet, vaguely resemble truth. The point is to have prepared a retort to ""why don't you use Google search?"" Because people will ask with the intent to condescend.<p>I find myself smug about the robotic eye logo because I think it is ironic. It is as if a totalitarian government plastered posters onto drab brick walls. The posters say: ""big brother respects your privacy."" And on the poster, above those words, is a picture of a robotic eyeball staring at the citizens who stopped to read.<p>I'd much rather have a fun reason to change loyalties, so I don't have to go into the many details.<p>It'll keep me from receiving the same flak as when I switched to Linux.",1260086864

It's certainly easier to declare a function in LuaJIT - you can take the definition directly from the header file, rather than transcoding it into s-exps.<p>Compare:<p><pre><code>  (define memcpy\n\t       (let ((this (dynamic-link)))\n\t         (pointer->procedure '*\n\t                             (dynamic-func ""memcpy"" this)\n\t                             (list '* '* size_t))))\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>  ffi.cdef [[\n\tvoid * memcpy ( void * destination, const void * source, size_t num );\n  ]]\n</code></pre>\nYou also get the ability to add metamethods and finalizers to returned C objects (so you can use Lua's built-in GC to clean up after, for example, your FILE*).<p>As for the speed, there's no reason that a lot of dynamic languages couldn't be as fast as LuaJIT. But none of them are even close. I wish LuaJIT was still up in the computer language shootout. The LuaJIT interpreter (with JIT turned off) is 3x faster than V8 on the PC, and faster than Java on Android.  And that's the interpreter - the JITed code is way faster.<p>Of course, macros are awesome, and a huge point in Guile's favor. On the plus side, Lua is very easy to understand, especially if you're coming from Javascript.",1328057989

Thanks.<p>Edit below in response to your edits.<p>In the US, options can be written from the day of an IPO and in the case of the Facebook IPO would likely be from existing retail (employees) and institutional investors looking to make revenue on the shares they own by loaning them out for options trading. Though not from the IPO's underwriters who can not loan out shares for options until 30 days after trading begins.<p>For the valuation I was writing about the up and downside risk of investing at those valuations. It might be obvious to you, but not to others. Actually a lower valuation in some cases could deter investors who had initially heard it would be much higher and they may not understand why an initial prospective valuation decreased.<p>There are a range of trading strategies that can be used for an IPO. The example I gave was to cover both increases and decreases in the initial trading price that would (usually) allow the investor to capture a (mostly) risk-free profit.",1328057755

Yes, that is a harsh thing to say but then reality can indeed be harsh.""<p>No one would deny that reality can be harsh.  At the same time, you can't deny that Apple - and, of course, the other electronics companies - does not truthfully convey that reality to its customers.  Doing so would not be in Apple's best interest.  However, if this boycott succeeds, it would demonstrate that having this tension between reality and image is also not in Apple's best interest.<p>The article also makes the standard corporatist argument that the behaviour of corporations is outside of their control, because they are subject to market forces.<p>This tact ignores the human factor.  Apple is made up of humans.  It is not humanly impossible to demand that a supplier adhere to higher standards than are prevalent in the rest of China.<p>Setting that aside, let's examine the issue purely from the standpoint of the marketplace, but rather than looking at the Chinese labour marketplace, let's look at the American consumer goods marketplace.<p>Humans respond to a variety of different factors when making purchasing decisions.  It is not just about price and quality, but can also be about morality and emotion.  In this instance, Apple's customers may be persuaded to boycott Apple because of these subjective factors.<p>That may seem unfair to some, but isn't that just a risk of globalization?  After all, a global company must deal with market forces everywhere it operates: both market forces affecting who makes its products, and market forces affecting who purchases them.<p>Apple will be forced to balance these market forces, and when it does so, it may result in lower profit margins but better working conditions at its suppliers' factories.",1328057072

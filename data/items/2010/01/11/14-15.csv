For everybody else that is just as alien as an electronics person that insists to build a complicated piece of equipment out of individual resistors, diodes and transistors.<p>When the first thin film circuitry appeared in the mid 70's (or at least, when I saw it for the first time, I must have been 10 or 11) the only thing other electronics hobbyists were wondering about was how they were going to repair them.<p>That's just as inconceivable to me today as it would be to perform surgery on in integrated circuit.",1263220923
1045137,comment,1043733,1043733,0,0,mbubb,,,"I love these systems.<p>The main branch of the New York Public Library had (still has?) a nice shiny brass system in the research room. You filled out a request on a little card and the librarian would put it into a metal canister and send it down to the stacks. I last used this in 1993 or so when I was a grad student in a literature department.<p>Then you would go to the big reading room and wait for your number to comeup on the big board. Some wonderful books there ( I remember getting a version of Vincente Huidobro's Altazor that looked like it had a dedication from the author.) And a beautiful old building to sit and read in.<p>The pnuematic tubes added a nice 'steampunk' feel to the experience (although that word didn't exist yet). I would have been reading William Gibson at the time I am sure though. I know that I  read the ""Difference Engine"" about this time.<p>It is so remarkable how these systems still exist in the 'older' modernist cities. I say older in reference to NYC because of the fact that it hasn't gone through a war so the intfrastructure is quite a bit older than the larger European or Asian cities. It is different in other cities. When I was in Seoul I would frequently visit a market that was near one of the old city gates. A freestanding market a few thousand years old. That's old - there is nothing in NYC that can touch that. The old stuff in NYC is a few hundred years old at most.<p>In NYC, the subway is still switched by hand at some places. There is a steam heating system under the streets that, on cold days like this billows up and forms impromptu clouds. And the brass pnuematic tubing at the NYPL.<p>These systems - especially the older bridges, streets and the subways - are crumbling. And in some ways the ""must have exposed brick in our apartment"" nostalgia for an older verdegris patina-ed existence is a false desire for something that never ways.<p>But you can't help but marvel when crossing something like the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey (think the Soprano's opening shots) or taking the subway under one of the river tunnels or walking up over the Brooklyn Bridge - that so much was possible with relatively little.<p>An idea that was beautifully expressed in some of the writing around the recent open-sourcing of the Apollo Lunar Module code from the first moon landing.<p><a href=""http://atlasobscura.com/places/pneumatic-system-new-york-public-library"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atlasobscura.com/places/pneumatic-system-new-york-pub...</a>",1263220900

There are plenty of self-replicating machines on earth that have been extremely successful at colonizing their environment, but we would not typically view them as ""rival life forms"".<p>> What functionality would you build into such a probe and by what means would you prevent a ""boomerang"" effect wherein it comes back and causes problems in the home system?<p>The simplest method would be to have them accept any order signed by a standard public key. I'm not sure why people tend to assume that a self-replicating machine cannot be controlled. There are plenty of self-replicating programs that are controlled very effectively.<p>> Additionally, if all you are talking about building is a device that would, encountering our solar system, take up residence in orbit, take pictures, and report ""back"" - how do you know there aren't already several of them present?<p>Because if have been many intelligent species in our galaxy over the past billion years, it seems unlikely that all would be careful to remain undetected. Certainly our species has little interest in hiding its activities.<p>> Colonization, as opposed to mere migration, was pretty much always, more or less by definition, for resource extraction.<p>Plenty of species on Earth colonize new environments without bothering to send resources back to their origins. And there have been plenty of human colonizations not linked to a controlling empire, especially when we were just hunter-gathers.",1263220655

This guide looks like a great improvement/accompaniment to libevent's docs.<p>One problem with using an event dispatcher like libevent is that libraries that make their own blocking calls won't cooperate. That means you'll often be stuck with limited capabilties, unless you write your own libraries or hack up existing ones.<p>There's a Python project called gevent (<a href=""http://www.gevent.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gevent.org/</a>) that works atop libevent. It monkey-patches the python socket module with a version that automatically cooperates with libevent's loop. It uses greenlets to make code written sychronously run asynchronously behind the scenes. If, for example, you want to use an Amazon S3 library that makes use of python's httplib (which would normally block and choke your event loop), it'll automatically work with gevent/libevent.

I honestly think that that this is one of the main reasons PHP is popular and is able to power even the most complex websites with ease.<p>Before PHP I did Basic (Atari), 6502 Assember, Logo, ACTION!, Pascal (Kyan, Turbo), C++ (Turbo, Borland) , Java, C#. After PHP I did JavaScript and Python.<p>First I've met PHP-like arrays in awk and was astonished with its versatility.<p>I still believe that data structure that allows person to make a queue, stack, tree, even graph easily without knowing any theory and planning anything is one of the greatest things I've encountered in programming languages.<p>I am very dissatisfied that python does not have standard ordered dictionary and strongly differentiates between tuple, array, set and dict even though they provide just overlapping subsets of odict functionality.",1263218452

8704796,comment,8704303,8704303,0,0,gk1,,,"I was nodding my head in agreement… All the way until the “How much would I charge?” part. Here’s something to consider for other freelancers reading this:<p>1. We all know what a pain it is to bill hourly. The way-off estimates, the tracking, the reporting… Why not bill on a daily/weekly/monthly rate? I know what you’re thinking: “But how will my client know how much work I’m doing?!” In the past year that I’ve been doing this, the ONLY people to ever ask me that were other freelancers, NOT clients/prospects. Clients–the good ones, at least–don’t CARE how many hours you’re spending to do X and Y, as long as you’re doing a damn good job at X and Y and adding significant value to their company.<p>2. Why tie your rates to your cost of living? (And number of vacation days, and tax rate, and other arbitrary multipliers/divisors…) Your rate should reflect the value you bring to a company. (Yes, figuring the value of your work for a company could be tricky, but that’s another matter…) Using living expenses to calculate your rates makes as much sense as pricing milk by the size of the cow that produced it. Charging based on value will almost always get you more than charging based on your thrifty living expenses. (And if it doesn’t, then either you’re underestimating your work’s value or your clients are way too small.)",1417791541

Sometimes they are necessary but commonly they are not.<p>There are specific cases where it&#x27;s better to pass a value rather than a reference, for example if you have an integer in a register, and your parameter passing conventions calls for passing parameters in registers, then passing that integer as a value, rather than a reference (const or otherwise) avoids the use of memory; it also avoids the use of the memory cache, which is likely to be a more serious problem.<p>In general, for a C++ program to make lots of allocations of just one class isn&#x27;t such a bad thing.  If your default implementation is slower than you like, you might be able to speed things up considerably, as well as save memory, reduce disk paging and so on by using a custom memory allocator just for that class.",1417791374

Because Apple was founded in 1976 and I&#x27;m guessing they aren&#x27;t going anywhere. Google was founded in 1998 and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going anywhere.<p>Your assertion is really flimsy, and I think based on seeing a large number of mismanaged companies that flare up and die quickly and then concluding this is normal or even unavoidable. While it may be common, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s what has to happen.<p>Rovio took their success and drove it into the ground. They absolutely saturated the market, coming out with new Angry Birds games and tie ins almost constantly and flooding store shelves with very low quality (and in my area, often dingy) plush animals, further lowering public perception of their brand.<p>I&#x27;d argue that if Rovio had been more judicious with their successful IP, that public interest in it wouldn&#x27;t have disappeared so completely.<p>You seem to be arguing that the fade was unavoidable since Angry Birds is just a game where you launch birds at pigs with a sling shot. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the follow up games needed to be. Super Mario Bros was just a game where a guy jumps on things. Now I&#x27;m not really saying that Angry Birds was necessarily an IP with as much legs as Mario, but I think they burned it down.<p>Rovio chose the short term, maximum immediate profit path, and now we&#x27;re seeing the result of that. Zynga did the same thing. When you go all in immediately, and don&#x27;t think about what is best for your long term, you burn out public interest in whatever you have to offer. When you don&#x27;t take the time to make what you&#x27;re putting out compelling, people will start to conclude everything you have to offer is just going to be more of the same. And they&#x27;ll be sick of it.<p>This is not the only path available, and asserting that it is just the way things are now is ridiculous.",1417789280

From reading quite a slew of articles (most of them talking about abandoning academia, few of them happen to be positive), I would cynically summarize: Do a PhD if you are either a) doing it for the prestigious degree or b) because the subject really interests you. Don&#x27;t do a PhD if a) you are hoping for a tenure or b) expect to earn more. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently &quot;noble&quot; in doing a PhD, so I think the outcome of the decision should entirely depend on how realistic your expectations are.",1417788016

On the contrary. While I think there were some very good reasons why the US ought to have intervened in World War II earlier, I also wish the US had learned more lessons from some of the wars mentioned above (and a lot of other foolish wars the European colonial powers were involved in).<p>Instead the US seems to have seen the way the waning colonial powers acted as a recipe for how it needed to behave as its own power grew, with - for anyone paying attention to the outcomes of the colonial wars - predictably horrible outcomes.<p>> Even the rest of Europe abandoned Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Germans before Poland fell<p>It&#x27;s easy to look back and regret those. But the politics around them, and the patchy history of Europe, made them politically &quot;tricky&quot;. The Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; happened on the background of the German Austria&#x27;s  previous <i>attempts</i> to merge with Germany, which was denied it by treaty, including the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938 Austria was under a semi-fascist dictatorship, and there was then pressure for a referendum on the issue (with extensive support and threats from Hitler). Facing lack of support from Mussolini who had previously protected them against Hitler, the Austrian government accepted a large number of nazis into government, who then used their positions to prepare and conduct a coup against the austro-fascists supported by threats of force on the basis of allegations of plans to rig the referendum. It was then the Austrian nazi government that handed control over to Germany in a manner designed to effectively be a <i>request</i> from the Austrian state for the Germans to enter Austria. They then carried out a vote to legitimise the takeover.<p>The combination of events made it politically extremely hard for outsiders to do much more than complain. Europe should go to war because a government asked for military support from a neighbour following allegations that the previous dictator may have tried to prevent the will of the people, in the face of widespread public support for the nazis? In retrospect, probably. But without the knowledge of what Hitler went on to do, it was squabbling between two authoritarian governments over control of an artificially created country with a history of wanting to merge, where the new dictator likely had as much or maybe even more support than the old dictator.<p>In the case of Czechoslovakia similarly, the state was an artifical creation from parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, that included a substantially ethnically German population in certain areas (Germans made up 23% of the population of Czechoslovakia) that had genuine grievances of oppression against the elite of the country, and the government also purposefully moved parts of the German population to the West, making it even easier to make excuses.<p>So Hitler was similarly able to play the role of someone who at least plausibly wanted to &quot;liberate&quot; the German population, and present the whole thing as &quot;rectifying&quot; a situation that was only 20 years old and an outcome of a previous war when the will of the people in question had been largely ignored when the borders were drawn up, and so got Sudetenland. When Hitler went into the rest of Czechoslovakia, he got the support of Slovakia, and both Hungary and Poland used the opportunity to annex area - he was not the only agressor, and support for going to war over Czechoslovakia when even the government over a substantial part of the twenty year old country took part in the aggression against the rest and supported the German invasion was not an appealing proposition.<p>While there were certainly fears and lots of people who had concerns about it, Hitler played people up against each other, and was dealing with governments who all had gotten their hands dirty in drawing up fairly arbitrary borders without the involvement of the affected people and/or through wars within the last few decades. Combine that with a strong degree of denial - nobody wanted to rush into a new war - and a lot of admiration for what Hitler had achieved domestically in Germany, coupled with a grudging acceptance that perhaps giving these people what they seemed to want might not be such a bad idea if it resolved some of the remaining tensions created by the Treaty of Versailles.<p>In retrospect, of course, that was stupid. But then in retrospect it was stupid to not intervene when Hitler remilitarised areas Germany was not allowed to militarise and in a whole host of other situations leading up to the war.<p>But the cases of Czechoslovakia and Austria were still substantially different than the case of Poland, both because they came first, but also because they were clouded in politics and could be &quot;explained away&quot; as something other than naked aggression. By the time of the invasion of Poland, though, there was no denying that Hitlers ambitions did not stop at &quot;liberating&quot; German speaking groups in weird little newly created states, and with the rapid fall of further states",1372757968

They were looking for some story no doubt hoping to hear that she had gone to meet someone.<p>This was a scandal that ultimately would lead to the closing of the tabloid.  It was a shame though, because the Guardian made a claim too many, they asserted that the tabloid journos deleted voice mail messages, as the mailbox was full, and they wanted to hear more gossip.  According to them at the time this lead to the family being given false hope about their daughter been alive.<p>Now, when you consider the questionable value that this untruth added to the story (it is frankly immoral and shocking enough that the tabloid hacked the phone) and ask how was it acquired?  Why was no standards of integrity followed, but mostly, why did they not think of the effect it would have on the friends and family of the murdered school girl.

I was born and currently live in Europe.<p>Funny thing is, while I absolutely loved learning and still do -- to the extent that an important factor in my choice of avoiding large corporations (after getting burned twice) was that a job there would leave me too little time for history, philosophy and programming of my own -- I didn&#x27;t go to school that much. I was one of the top students in the class (I even unintentionally ended up as a valedictorian, so besides my BSc in Instrumentation Engineering they also handed me a badge of nerd shame or something), but I was regularly getting into trouble for skipping classes, faking illnesses and, every once in a while, challenging the professors&#x27; authority.<p>Fortunately, I actually had my parents behind me on this, and both of them are teachers (high school and university level, respectively). I&#x27;d literally tell my dad I was too hung over to go to school this morning, he&#x27;d shrug and tell me that as long as I think it&#x27;s best to stay at home, I can stay at home.<p>And it was ok. I&#x27;m not starving -- I&#x27;m actually quite well off -- I have a job that I love, I do what I like and what I am best at. Despite my trouble with authority, my academic credentials are fairly good (to the extent that I am a published author -- my work ended up in IEEE journals -- but that was before I got my BSc, and I didn&#x27;t push for an MSc after that).<p>Quite frankly, I&#x27;m horrified at the amount of work we put children to. I managed to dodge it because the system in my home country is shaggy enough that, as long as you&#x27;re blunt and cunning enough, you can get away with anything. The sheer thought of actually having gone to school all that time is simply unrealistic, I&#x27;d have broken down.<p>I think this is a typical case of &quot;when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot;. No one bothers to think what the problem is, and appears to put it strictly in terms of MOAR SCHOOL MY LITTLE MINIONS! This is woefully unproductive. I swear, if I&#x27;ll ever have kids of my own, I&#x27;ll do just like my dad did with me -- encourage them to think for themselves and learn what&#x27;s interesting for them, treating school as the necessary diploma-producing evil it seems to have ended up in our days.",1372755770

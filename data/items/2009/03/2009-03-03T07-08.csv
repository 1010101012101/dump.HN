501188,comment,500781,500952,0,0,thesethings,,,"Can I ask you (and others in a similar boat) a question about your work environment? When you say ""I have to use IE at work,"" do you mean at the exclusion of other browsers? I too have to <i>have</i> IE6 at work (many old business apps require it), but I can also run Firefox, Chrome, Flock, Safari, etc. And I don't mind having multiple browsers open, in fact, I just usually do naturally, without any impetus.
Does you workplace lock it down so you have only one browser?",1236066207

501185,comment,500919,501083,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"When I worked in college admissions we'd get a report from one of the standardized testing companies every year that basically showed that black and hispanic people scored lower than whites and asians across the board, everywhere.  You hear about this stuff on the news and assume it's true.  But then you see graph after graph after graph displaying the gulf and it's a still a shocker.  We'd probably not have standardized tests anymore if the average Joe was able to see at a glance how much worse blacks and hispanics do on them in every part of the country and under every possible set of testing conditions.<p>That said, I'm white, and I also learned about regattas by reading about them in a book somewhere.  I was bummed out when they got rid of analogies on the SAT.  I studied hard to learn new words so i could do well on that part, which I found difficult.",1236066122

These biases - financial, psychological, etc - will have a significantly larger influence on how children perform than what you're testing for (genetic differences).",1236065771

This would make the statement above equivalent to ""the recent drop in the market shows that there is a risk of a much larger drop"", which seems sort of obvious.<p>Am I missing something deeper?",1236065454

That's the wrong way to go about web development.  Run IE7 on your dev box and build everything against it.  That's what your users will have, so that should be your first priority.  Step two is making it work for FF.<p>The added benefit to that approach is that you'll find less cross platform issues.

   - Dates. Education level is one of the main filters

   - Parents of women you're dating

   - Universities, if you ever want to hang out for a year doing research between startups

Lol IRC troll warzzZ<p>Because he was never able to defend his xp winbox against me getting inside his home lan by constantly falling for obvious side channel attacks (I'd pretend to be a girl interested in him, link him to my fake personal blog which was actually full of IE exploits back when they went unpatched for months) I had a lot of time to poke around his home lan and eventually I discovered he was stealing his neighbours wifi for some of the harassment against me so it wouldn't trace back to him.<p>This neighbour had a VNC port open, which at the time was exploitable so I started it up and enabled my xp backdoor on that system too as another attack vector. The original plan was to start doing some MITM attacks I was just learning about he wouldn't notice while thinking he was untraceable through stolen wifi, but then I got stupid and impatient. Note: I was no master hacker, the exploits I had were merely downloaded off shady forums like shadowcrew. I was an idiot with just enough knowledge to be dangerous at the time.<p>When he changed ISPs under a new name so I couldn't track him I just logged into his neighbours network where I left the door open and waited for him to connect to the stolen wifi. Re-owned his fresh system with a new permanent backdoor, set up a whole toolbox of spyware, and proceeded to do a bunch of illegal shit under his name like using his card which I had gleaned from a keylogger to buy illegal sex tourist vacations from very obvious fake FBI sting sites so somebody would start monitoring him (i have no idea if they did, I assume they did). Interesting note, when I stole his card, he was using it on his fresh install he thought was secure to pay for a data report on me from one of those information clearing house sites.<p>The emergency system attack was just using the same VNC exploit. Somebody on shadowcrew discovered they were using it and was daring other hackers to break in which pretty much guaranteed an instant bust if you were stupid enough to do so. This was E911 with admins using printout logs and checking them daily not a restaurant to fleece credit card numbers from where nobody will notice you for a year or so. We all made our own temporary vpns and used disposable sim card dongles and wireless hacking but still you'd be playing with fire screwing with E911.<p>Naturally this was perfect for what I needed and when I assumed the feds had started watching this guy I accepted the 911 bounty, logged into his system, connected through his neighbors wifi leaving a huge trail of identifying cookie crumbs to follow back to him like opening up his hotmail and yahoo accounts which would've all been logged when they looked at his neighbour for the breach, and proceeded to absolutely trash around their network trying to get somebody to notice and yanked some database tables.<p>Then I left a nice package of evidence for the cops to find in his system that was poorly hidden, cleaned all traces of me being on his neighbours system, cleaned all traces of me being in his network, and for good measure went online using his browser to attempt to sell the info on every carding forum there was to attract even more authority attention.<p>When I heard on the same game channel where the troll battle began that the reason he disappeared for almost 3 months was because he was in jail, I gloated my victory like a fool to my hacker friends on IRC who told me from their own experience he was probably looking at being transferred to federal and doing serious time in the double digits, which I could not let happen in all good conscience, even if I absolutely hated this guy so turned myself in figuring since I was underage I could probably slide on my stupidity by transparently admitting to everything and hoping for the best. Thankfully I received the Cosmo of UGnazi crew sentence and not the Kevin Mitnic solitary confinement revenge sentence.<p>Now when I google my name I just see the crazy baiter troll battleship nonsense he's written over the decade in my name with obvious references he knows I would understand to let me know it's him and to pick up where we left off. There's a hundred posts the latest one was Sep 2012.",1359352296

When I learned the Visitor pattern at the University I attended, it was one of the hardest things to wrap my head around initially until it finally clicked what it was while writing the code. It's just so counter intuitive to what most would think imperative language design is initially that it can take a bit to sink in. It seems simple enough, but trying to understand it and implement it are two different beasts. I would have gladly done it in a functional language or a Lisp variant if given the option.<p>Having to explain the Visitor pattern though to someone else would be much more painful than that I imagine versus just writing and explaining it in F#.

Juries are people of good will and have common sense.""<p>This system ""fundamentally works"" if you have the money to make it work for you.  Most individuals, small and medium businesses simply cannot afford the cost of seeking justice.  In my opinion this is true of civil, business an criminal law.<p>Example:<p>Back when I was younger and far dumber I client stiffed me for about $125K of work.  Of course, off I went to a lawyer.  By the time I spent about $8,000 in legal fees I realized that all I was doing was paying for my attorney and their attorney to write what I came to call ""love letters"" to each other.  I called them ""love letters"" because every time they wrote one, regardless of content, they got paid handsomely by both parties.  I decided to lick my wounds and move on.  Good thing I did.  The client ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection and stiffed a bunch of other businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  They formed a new corp pretty much in parallel and have been operating ever since.<p>Would money have made a difference here?  Maybe.  Don't know.  I had a similar situation with a large (multi-billion dollar global corp) that cause us huge damage.  There was simply no way to go after them without putting-up at least $500K in the bank for legal fees.  Not a fight I could have considered.  And so, even though they were decidedly in the wrong, they, effectively, ""wrote their own laws"" or were able to ignore them because they could fight a fight I couldn't even begin to consider.<p>What I do know is that it sure felt like there was a huge asymmetry in justice.  It's almost like one can exist in this parallel universe where the practical result was that laws simply were not applied in the same way to those with less money to ""buy"" justice.",1359350778

5127238,comment,5124476,5125474,2,0,gizmo686,,,">Hell, even last week, I've upgraded a server on Archlinux and it totally broke my system without any warning. I really needed help so I went on #archlinux and I've been told that I should have read the archlinux news before tempting an update. Fair enough, I guess.. but I can understand that on a extremely tight schedule, games developers can't waste time on stuff like that. Compared to say, [next] [next] [finish] windows install where everything just Work.<p>I don't think Arch is a fair comparison to make. The Arch wiki describes it as:
""Arch Linux is an independently developed, i686/x86-64 general purpose GNU/Linux distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is installed as a minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal environment is assembled by installing only what is required or desired for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not officially provided, and most system configuration is performed from the shell and a text editor. Based on a rolling-release model, Arch strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers the latest stable versions of most software."" [1]<p>I use Ubuntu primarily, but use Windows exlusivly to use LabView for a local robotics team. I have had issues with both systems. The difference for me is that when the issue was with Ubuntu, I can norally get it back to a workable state withing 10 minutes, or if desperate do a full reinstall in under an hour after which point I have all of my same programs installed, and my configurations/user data restored. When my problem is with windows, solving it is a full days work (or more).

You can take a sufficiently intelligent 17 year old and give them a top notch medical education in five years. In Ireland and the UK Medicine is an undergraduate degree and takes five or six years depending on the university. If you got rid of summers off you could do it very comfortably in four. Making medicine a second entry degree is a giant waste of social resources.",1359349642

55872,comment,55720,55720,0,0,kcl,,,"Pleasant article. It's easy to relate to the feeling of wonderment the non-programmers have, since, in a sense, on our first big project we're all non-programmers. I wish I could generate the amount of code I used to in those days.<p>The problem now isn't overcoming the language, or figuring out what to do, it's staying focused on what's really the same boring implementation you've been doing since the beginning. I know exactly what my next thousand lines of code are going to be. I just can't bring myself to sit down and type them out for hours on end.",1190058858
55871,comment,55794,55794,0,0,tdedecko,,,"The article did not go into a lot of detail about how the development of the geologic timescale contributed to the science of geology. One of the most important contributions of the timescale was giving scientists a framework to correlate geologic events. For example the KT boundary groups the events of a mass extinction, elevated trace amounts of iridium, and the impact crater in Mexico. Before the timescale and radioactive dating, geologic events such as these were witnessed across the globe, but never correlated to be one single event.",1190058835

It creates a simple procedure for accessing and executing any C++ functions or objects from an xml file Awa allows developpers to export any of their given C++ code to an xml format.The exported elements can then be loaded and executed.There are no constraints imposed on the objects or functions you wish to export.You only create a MetaObject that describe the different properties of the object(public member fn, public data) . Awa is intended to be used for developping zero install type applications by accessing and running the client native graphic capabilities remotely. Awa is very easy to use, flexible and portable. Awa is still at a very early stage(though functionnal).Mass feedback from the community will be appreciated. <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/awa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/awa</a>\n",1190057774

55857,comment,55660,55840,0,0,brlewis,,,"Even worse, I'm using md5 as my hash, just because it was built into postgresql.  I should do more to protect users who choose weak passwords, as I feel they should be allowed to do so for my site.  (They also have the option of never choosing a password and always logging in with a one-time link.)  What tends to bother me more is the idea of someone choosing a reasonably strong password, one that isn't vulnerable to reasonably-expected brute-force attacks, and having some new dictionary attack crack it just because I was stingy with my salt.  The other reason I worry about the cracking of strong passwords more is that it's more likely that a strong password would be shared with banks, etc.\n",1190057026

They also had a leg up, by being Blake Fucking Ross and Joe Fucking Hewitt.<p>Versionate is a big project, but they were well-started by the time of application.<p>Octopart is a big project.  They faked it until they made it, and did so beautifully (their presentation was among the best on Demo Day for WFP07).<p>Loopt is a big set of problems, most of them non-technical, and pg considers it the best thing out of YC to date (and I see why...Sam's kicking ass).<p>Zenter was hard.  But they broke the rules and pretended like it was easy and actually produced something that mostly worked in a few months.<p>So, yeah, while the majority of YC companies are pretty small ideas that can be executed by a very small team, many success stories (or success stories in the making) out of YC have been big ideas.",1190056995

Despite all the greatness we think that we built, most people simply won't care.  And spam is the evil that doesn't think it's evil because it thinks it's doing everyone else a service.<p>""And I'm not saying that television is vulgar and dumb because the people who compose the Audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests."" X David Foster Wallace<p>While the guy is a novelist, and not in television, he's done work in observing the effects of television on fiction.  But, I think it makes sense.<p>Given that, unless your service is pretty basic, like water and sun of the internet, or pretty vulgar, like porn (also appeal to basic affinity towards sex), it will probably only first appeal to those that are interested in that particular niche.  <p>This is why finding those people that are fans or first movers in that particular field/industry is important, and especially if they're obsessed enough to keep a blog on it, due to a need they have to tell other people.  For a new market however, you'll need to find a cross-section that cuts across other groups--this, I have no idea how to do.<p>Anyway, that's why it's usually considered a good idea to pick problems that are your problems to work on for a startup, because in addition to scratching your own itch, you'll know where to find other complaining fools (besides yourself) that have the same problem.  If you can do it well, they'll tell others.\n",1190056806

For users that choose a password of only 7 characters, that's only 11 characters hashed.  The rainbow table covered a significant chunk of all 14-character strings.  Even if I switch to a hash function that runs slower and produces longer values, I still think that 4 characters is too short a salt given the way things are going.<p>If I move to, say, a 16-character salt, after that I'll agree that making it longer is pointless.",1190055651

The diagnostic tool is connected to the car and then phones home to a central system to get vehicle-specific codes required to perform some actions. One such action, oddly enough is getting the car to recognize a new ECU[a].<p>[a] you can circumvent this by reflashing another ECU with special firmware to become a 'clone' of the original but this would be very analogous to having to 'root' your phone to install different software.",1322848751

There's far less risk in doing it that way than the reverse. Even if you make mistakes while small if you are profitable or even on the bubble of profitability you can overcome them. Just about any mistake on timeline, acquiring investment funding, ""monetization"", or budget can easily sink a ""grow then make money"" style startup.

I think it is clear-headed: whatever rules we make about copyright, we have to justify them in terms of public benefit, not some intrinsic, inalienable right to intellectual property.<p>Practically, though, if you could make any law you wanted: what would you do? How would you manage the transition from the current regime to some more permissive regime? From the perspective of copyright owners, that will look like a legislative taking, like seizing a piece of real estate or canceling a pension.<p>Would you grandfather in the current IP holders, or give them some kind of grace period?

Their support requires either a pin or last 6 of a CC used on the account to validate callers, if you can provide that they'll update the email on file and help reset the password, but he said his account email is unchanged. So the person taking the name would either have to know the account password, or have access to the email address on file where the reset requests are sent.<p>Given that this would have to happen from inside the customer account, I can understand why Go Daddy would want to confirm that this was indeed a nefarious act and not something like a domain being sold, transferred, then reported stolen to keep the cash and get the domain back.

3304809,comment,3303352,3303548,4,0,breckinloggins,,,"For some reason I found it was easier to learn a little Common Lisp first before moving to Clojure.  There are a few reasons for this, I think:<p>- CL has been around so long, there are TONS of good books and online documentation.  Clojure literature is just starting out, really<p>- Clojure places a strong emphasis on functional programming.  I have no doubt that this was the right decision, but trying to wrap your head around Lisp AND FP at the same time is... well... I hope you have plenty of headache medication because your brain's gonna hurt.  CL is at home in the imperative and  OOP style, so you can get your Lisp on first, then get hip to the functional jive.  A good thing about all Lisps though is that you naturally end up writing most things in a functional style anyway.  It just kinda happens.<p>- It's a bit unsettling to learn lisp by learning Clojure if you still have a bad taste in your mouth when it comes to Java.  When you use CL, you know you're on a pure Lisp platform, so when it comes time to learn Clojure you'll just ""know"" when you're doing something in idiomatic Clojure/Lisp vs punting to Java.<p>- Clojure has more native data structures than Common Lisp (by that I just mean more homoiconic data structures, I'm aware that CL actually has arrays and hashtables and such).  This is much better, IMO, from a practical perspective, but might get in the way when you're trying to grok the philosophical purity of Lisp.<p>So my advice is to start with Common Lisp and then move to Clojure.  Specifically:<p>1. Read ""Land of Lisp"" (<a href=""http://landoflisp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landoflisp.com/</a>).  It's a gentle introduction to Lisp and it's fun.<p>2. Read ""Practical Common Lisp"" (<a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>) and have fun with the ""practicals"".  I really love this book because you build kind of ""real stuff"" and it helps tie all the concepts together.<p>3. Read and try to understand pg's ""On Lisp"" (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a>).  It gives you a much better take on what makes Lisps so much more powerful than other programming languages.<p>4. Watch Rich Hickey's talks on blip.tv (<a href=""http://blip.tv/clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blip.tv/clojure</a>).  I would recommend watching the ""Clojure for Java Programmers"" talks first, then the ""Clojure for Lisp Programmers"".  You'll need to budget about 5 - 6 hrs to watch all four videos.  You probably don't want to watch the latter until you know things like what a Lisp-1 is vs a Lisp-2, what ""homoiconic"" means, and the difference between a macro and a reader macro.  I'm not saying you need that knowledge specifically for the talk, just that if you know what those all mean then there's a good chance you'll get a lot of value out of the talk.<p>5. Install Clojure and play around with it.  I liked trying to port the stuff from Land of Lisp and Practical Common Lisp to Clojure as it got me on firm footing quickly.  For the former, take a look at this StackOverflow post: (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5363393/rewriting-wizard-game-of-land-of-lisp-in-clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5363393/rewriting-wizard-...</a>) to get started.  Then, head over to PCL->Clojure (<a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2008/09/16/pcl-clojure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2008/09/16/pcl-clojure.html</a>) for help in converting the CL practicals over to Clojure.<p>6. Get idiomatic by reading good Clojure code.  I recommend the [Clojure source](<a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojure</a>) itself as well as Compojure (<a href=""https://github.com/weavejester/compojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/weavejester/compojure</a>) to get started.<p>Finally, a note on development environments: just use whatever works for you.  I prefer Emacs, but note that getting Clojure working well with Emacs is slightly more difficult than getting CL working well with Emacs.  This is mainly because you can run into dependency issues and out of date packages fairly easily.  However, if you get Emacs up and running with Common Lisp through SLIME (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/</a>) and enable paredit (<a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit</a>) and all that good stuff, you'll have almost zero learning curve developing Clojure in Emacs using swank-clojure (<a href=""https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure</a>).<p>If you just want to play around with Clojure quickly and still have SOME semblance of an IDE that understands Lisp, try clooj (<a href=""https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj</a>).  It's a bit bland on the looks side and low on features, but it gives you parenthesis matching and a nice REPL so it's a good way to play around with Clojure without feeling committed.",1322847259

And that would be in the public's interest.<p>By comparison, implicit in your argument is an endorsement of the current system, wherein 77 years of copyright is just fine. From a deontological perspective, perhaps. Certainly lawyers make their money perpetuating a purely deontological view of the world, claiming they're the only ones who can parse the ontology of duties.<p>This divide between the deontological position to a consequentalist position is exactly the bridge Lessig believes the Supreme Court wanted him to cross, and he failed to realize it. Free Culture was his mea culpa.<p>I'm not sure how old you are, but my personal observation at 35 is that the quality of public discourse has improved since the advent of the internet. It would be a tough sell to claim that more information is better, but more access to high quality information is worse. Fundamentally, it's not about honoring the terms of scams corporate lobbyists perpetrated as we awoke from a 50-year TV-induced coma. It's about the public interest. In that paradigm, a consequentalist paradigm focused on the public interest, more access to high quality information is better.<p>Building the quantitative body of evidence to examine the consequentalist position is exactly what scholars have been laboring at for the last decade. And arguably the most advanced, sophisticated, educated society on the planet has examined the evidence and found it sufficient to directly, explicitly, reject in whole and in part, the deontological arguments of the old business model.<p>I will stretch this a bit further: if you look at history, I think you will find progress is often a story that starts with a deontology, a consequentalist argument forms, which is then backed up with evidence, adopted, and then forms the foundation of a new, hopefully less misguided deontology. If you can identify a deontology, look for consequentalist arguments that oppose it.<p>edit in reply to geoffschmidt: How to implement? I think we have seen that grandfathering current stakeholders has historically been an effective path to progress in the long term. As the new rules apply to more people, the old rules enjoy progressively fewer supporters, and eventually the new rules prevail. In terms of defining their copyright as ""property"", we're getting into the merits of the term ""intellectual property"", which is a red herring. There is no such thing under the law, but it is a very useful conflation of ideas for patent lawyers who need to pay off their Maseratis. The facts will set you free.",1322845815

I find the coder ""puritanism"" leaking into startups and I can't say I agree with it.<p>Starting a business <i>has</i> been done in many ways.  Having been in business for 15 years I have gotten to meet a lot of other small business owners and there is as much variety in how established businesses came to be.<p>Having this delusion of its only a ""real"" startup if you do it this way is hogwash.  So many great businesses were built on hard work, sacrifice, long hours, juggling more than one thing at once, until the new business could stand on it's own two feet.<p>Knowing when, and what your new business needs (more time, stepping away from other obligations) is a critical skill.  Simply committing all of your time to one thing without a wider business, or varied experience can in some cases be a detriment.",1322845455

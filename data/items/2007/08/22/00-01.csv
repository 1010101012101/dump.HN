45043,comment,44876,44896,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"Interestingly, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, spent quite a lot of time teaching in schools, and writing textbooks and articles aimed at that level of audience.  This was especially true later in his career.  As arguably the greatest mathematician of his time, he inspired many Soviet mathematicians and physicists to make a lot of time for teaching in Schools.  Paul Erdos also made a great deal of time to meet with students.  More recently, Physics Nobelist Carl Wieman quit the US because his work on physics education wasn't being funded.  Of course, these examples don't contradict your statement, but they do make one wonder what is possible.\n",1187743725

45041,comment,44876,44936,0,0,Keios,,,"Hi Palish,\n Thanks for your response. Some more thoughts...<p>The challenge is that the current system is generic, it allows you to choose any field of work or study and that choice can be postponed. In your school, that choice is made early and that brings with it a risk.<p>I think your pain was that 'you' felt mentally caged in the current educational system and that 'you' fixed your pain by making a change. What you seem to be doing now is applying a 'mass fix ' by generalizing/abstracting your problem, and while that works in most cases it may need additional fleshing out. Perhaps the fix for each individual might be more effective, perhaps everyone who feels caged needs to apply an individual patch just like you did rather than fix something which isn't broken when they are in 6th grade. Are we fixing before there is a pain?<p>Hope these thoughts help you develop your idea. Best of luck.",1187742898

It still seems like a mistake to not transition to their new system piece-meal. I've witnessed this first hand a few times already in doing contract work. I'm pretty gun shy about it now and I definitely buy into what Joel said a lot more than I did before.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/fog00...</a>",1187741975
45038,comment,44876,44896,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I dont like the idea of selecting kids for anything at age 5. But I'm not sure its impossible. <p>One of my most vivid memories of childhood is from about 7 years old, when my brothers class (he was 9 or so) was doing an entrepreneurial project. The premise was a company to build the best paper aeroplane, where longer flights would earn more money which you could spend on more materials. Or something. I remember being obsessed by it, and begging to be allowed to do it as well. The same things I love about startups now (having come back to that realisation after a detour to phd land) is exactly the same as then.<p>What I love about startups is sort of hard to explain. Its not exactly running my own company, I find little excitement in the idea of a consulting firm. Its really being in that feedback loop of making, selling, reinvesting and growing. Its plugging the outputs back into the inputs, optimizing your clever piece of technology and scaling out of sight.<p>I desperately want schools to include more of these sorts of projects when my kids (first one on the way, yikes :) go to school. I think entrepreneurship and creativity are deeply linked.",1187741348

To make it worth their wild the string could be, say, a link that resolves to a map of their location on hackrtrackr. ",1187741153

Being first in your class, getting accepted to a good school, etc. There are definitely pros and cons to doing things alone vs a group.",1187741038

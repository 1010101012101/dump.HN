3172788,comment,3169475,3172276,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Some of what you say makes much sense. I went to a school with about 20% blacks. Although I have heard from others in more homogenous schools that its not much better. You are also right it is not limited to blacks but I could not think of a term that succinctly captured a minority but from a less affluent demographic and more likely to be of a culture that has fractured from its roots.<p>But part of what you say is a symptom of the chronic heuristic I spoke of. To perpetuate ignorance just because those who do not appreciate it will leave? makes no sense. Why, leaving is almost part of the job description of a sports or entertainment job and they don't get ostracized. Plus part of the problem is a lack of availability of models. The more that achieve the more it becomes okay to try an intellectual avenue as a way out and the less and less notable it becomes to be interested in say math. Plus as a matter of numbers some of them will come back to try and better things, the spaces in entertainment are much more limited than in technology.<p>Finally, ""acting white"" exactly exemplifies what I mean. Just because I am not fluent in ebonics, like music with guitars in it, like to read scifi by Egan and books on information theory does not mean I am acting  white. Nor does my like of chicken, basketball, funk, hiphop and bboying mean I am acting black. It is a cultural and personal lifestyle choice not predicated on color in deciding what I wish to identify with.",1319921859

(I'm extremely intense and opinionated, to the point of being moralistic.) I was a lot worse when I had no spiritual path. The fact that I still have personal difficulties (as nearly everyone does, including most Buddhists) does not mean that my practice has been without value.<p>Spiritual progress is intensely personal and hard to measure, but the existence of anger in a person doesn't make that person ""a bad Buddhist"". It's not like Western concepts of religion where you're a bad $RELIGIOUS_DEMONYM or a good one. There are skilled people and unskilled people. Steve Jobs was using Buddhist teachings and practices to develop skills that most people don't have and that he probably lacked, to some degree, even unto death. No shock there.

The only thing that I don't see coming from today's tech is the holographic projects. Oddly, most of the design seems to look like Apple-inspired tech. Does Apple consciously design to look like a sci-fi future? Or do their views of the future become shaped like Apple?<p>* In the cubes, there are no walls. The cube-dweller did not have headphones. Major, major ""graaah""<p>* There are a ton of animations between slides in the screens. This is a waste of time.<p>* I didn't see any ""stupid"" activities like reading Failbook, watching MTV, any of those very popular mental cheetos activities. The future has ""stupid"" entertainment.<p>* Transparent fridge door = win. Where do I get one? I like that future!<p>* Also, one curious thing about this is that this is a presentation of <i>rich</i> people (that's not an indictment). The wealthy people whose houses I've visited who are rich in the US seem to have large amounts of space and everything seems to be insanely tidy (maid service? I don't know).  Most less wealthy people have less space and things are a bit more jumbled up and around.  This seems to be a conceptualization of a junior executive and her family.",1319921469

Sending a user request to a JVM to be run in an interpreter with cold caches is not good for user satisfaction, so a newly restarted JVM needs to be given mock requests to warm it up (like a script for PGO static compilation). A JVM doing a full GC does not need all that to become fully ready, and if it has enough free RAM to defragment quickly, the process should be much more efficient.",1319921127

And <i>the large majority of research projects take five or ten years and then fail to discover anything noteworthy.</i> Learn to be perfectly happy with that, or do something other than research.<p>Do not underestimate the fundamentally slow and boring nature of research. It is a long, long game, the kind of game that started before you were born and that may make only a handful of moves in your lifetime. Your field may go <i>backwards</i> for decades at a time. Don't worry, do good work, all will sort itself out eventually.<p>You will spend literally <i>decades</i> getting it right, exploring all the important side tracks, perfecting the difficult techniques. Going to school in science, <i>reading</i> other people's science, is about novelty, because you discover new things as quickly as you can read. But your own science is about consistency. Think of Knuth, who started his grand project nearly fifty years ago and who is up to volume 4 of 7.<p>Remember that, by the time you are the world expert in some fundamental and ground-breaking field, it won't seem that special to you. It's like being the world expert on your own backyard. You will know more about <i>half</i> of the plants in your yard than mankind was meant to know, but you'll also live in secret terror because people <i>expect</i> you to know about the <i>other half</i> as well, and you know that you really don't. And, unless you're lucky and the soil in your backyard turns out to contain the cure for stomach cancer, <i>you will never meet anyone who particularly cares</i> that you're the world expert on your own backyard. It will bore people almost as much as talk of PHP applications bores people. [1] Except at the annual convention of backyard fetishists. There's a couple hundred of you in the world. Those conventions are the highlight of your professional year.<p>Read the life story of Gregor Mendel. That's you. Now, by all accounts Gregor Mendel had a pretty good life, puttering around in the pea patch, but he was out of biology, and dead, before people figured out he was on to something. That's fundamental research for you. Don't go into research because you want to be a superstar. Go into it because you like puttering around with peas and hanging out with the other smart gardeners.<p>Start writing a research grant today, even if the first draft sucks, even if it takes you <i>months</i> to read the existing literature and figure out something new and interesting to propose. I used to think it was torture for universities like MIT to force first-year grad students to pick an adviser at the time of admission and propose their own research. Now I'm not so sure. Practice grant-writing now, because that's really what your future in research is about. If you can't sell your line of research to the customer in advance, you don't want to be a researcher.<p>Read <i>A Ph.D. is Not Enough</i>, read Hamming's <i>You and Your Research</i>, and good luck to you! Grad school in science or engineering may or may not be a mistake in any particular case, but at least it's one of the most survivable mistakes you'll ever make.<p>Oh, that's right, I almost forgot: For god's sake, survive. Be alert for signs of depression. First-year grad school is overwhelming, and actually getting <i>out</i> of grad school can be even harder.

AFAIK, Apple, Inc does not own their trademark in the business of cafs. I'd generally spout about protecting one's trademarks, but in this case, my opinion is that they've stepped outside of the area where it's even questionable whether they have a case.

I knew this existed in classic GPS devices but never realized how useful it was until I actually used it. Plus it does not require a signal which is actually really useful when you travel to Canada (from the USA) where you cannot use the local telephone service unless you are ready to pay a lot of money.<p>I think iPhone with Tom-Tom is fine. It costs $60 dollars but you can share it with 4 other devices which means you can spread the cost.",1319918643

3172665,comment,3171665,3172011,7,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>The core of the problem is that there are public officials, ""public servants"" as they try to call themselves, that come to work and say ""Gee what am I going to do today? I know I'll go harass some little girls. Yeah, they're breaking the rules, after all. Good job! Go me!"" and are completely ok with it.</i><p>Not so. A lot of times, in fact probably the majority, they are responding to complaints from other vendors.<p>This is especially true at events; vendors pay a <i>lot</i> of money (often a few thousand a day, paid months in advance) to the organizers for the right to set up a food or refreshment stall, and are subject to safety inspections themselves. So they object to anyone else coming along and doing the same thing for free, even if they're only selling small amounts. Event vendors live on fairly thin margins; since they're transient they can't count on repeat business of any kind. If it's a kid that's cute, but if the kid is selling commercial beverages rather than home-made lemonade (as shown in the photo accompanying the article), then professional retailers see that as a front for the parent who is buying the stuff in bulk at Costco. Having worked as an organizer on a few musical festivals, I regret to say that they're sometimes correct about this.",1319918610

If so, wouldn't that mean that saying ""less dense"" and ""colder"" mean basically the same thing at that scale?<p>Maybe I'm asking something stupid and obvious, but I keep thinking that energy can't be destroyed, ergo, there's exactly as much energy (and thus heat?) as before. Or is heat energy density? But doesn't that make ""less dense and colder"" a redundant statement, since they'd be the same thing?",1319918483

Yes, in an interview saying the thing you quoted would obviously be a red flag, and something I would never say.  I understand the need in interviews to impress using your problem solving skills.
However, I believe that in your day to day job as a programmer, that quote is more appropriate - that you understand how particular data structures should be used rather than it's inner workings.  
In this case, if we assume that the reason you're being interviewed is so you can do well at the day to day stuff, then my quote makes more sense.<p>I get you though; you want someone who can solve many new problems but it highly unreasonable to put a programmer in an unrealistic situation like an interview and expect them to perform just as well as they would on the job.

One way is to be incredibly good at one thing - like Roger Federer.  The other way is to keep combining interesting and related things until you're there - ie., someone in the top 10% at coding, design, sales, biology, and construction.<p>Here's the thing - recently, we've been discussing the willingness of companies trying to hire to accept ""false negatives"" because the impact of a bad hire is so detrimental to a team.  But I think a lot of ""false negatives"" may be coders who do <i>pretty</i> well in the interview but not quite well enough to get past the filter.  The interview process almost never gets at their other skills.  So the company fails to hire someone with exceptional domain experience and good design skills because he or she struggled a bit finding cycles in a linked list.<p>There are solutions for people like this.  One is to be a founder - get an idea, start coding and designing, create an initial app, and see what kind of traction you can get.  The other is very similar - you'll managed to get hired somewhere eventually, and you can start proposing projects.  Eventually, you'll get to run with one, and you can be entrepreneurial about it (well less upside but at least you'll have a salary).<p>It's much easier to do this on your own or once you're established with a company.  It's tough to get this across in an interview process.",1324407153

That was never its intended used and most people understand this. Not every HTTP server is a public web server however. It is very convenient to fire up one as a test server and to get around some of the browser security constraint on the file:// scheme. It is also useful for a lot of light weight internal integration and configuration UI. To deploy SimpleHTTPServer for production web server is not a correct use. But neither is deploying a heavy weight HTTP server like Apache for testing or light weight integration appropriate.<p>I agree JSON is preferable to pickle in most situations. But you have to understand the history context. Pickle was the standard way to serialize object well before JSON is popularized. Serialization is an important topic in general and you will find many other computer language provides similar facility. Also JSON only address a subset of the serialization problem.<p>The array module is used not only for performance. It also support tight packing of data. If you have a million integer, array pack them tight as 1 million x 4 bytes. To store them into a list will have a much larger memory footprint because the are stored as 1 million individual objects plus the data structure of the list. I happen to have written a proprietary database engine in Python where memory, disk and I/O footprint matter hugely. Go easy on berating it because there are use cases you are not aware of.<p>It is sad that the author do not understand namedtuple but choose to mock it. I studied the code extensively and emulated it in a my application. To appreciate namedtuple, think about what is the alternative to this implementation? Try to write your own that serve the same function. Yes you can more easily and the code more readable by doing it with __setattr__ and __getattr__. The only problem every time you access an attribute you get hit with a big overhead. The use of exec is not a hack but a deliberated decision to provide attribute access at a speed comparable to standard attribute access. I agree with the author, ""do not do this at home"". Leave the heavy lifting to the experts unless you really known Python inside out like namedtuple's author Raymond Hettinger.",1324406681

3374517,comment,3373702,3373702,2,0,sp4rki,,,"In my case I'm a designeer because of the circumstances of my interests at diverse times and the way I learned such interests. I started to get acquainted with linux when I was 7 or 8. I was coding C when I was 13 and then at 15 I was really interested in everything design. I ended up doing Web Design at 17. At 19 I opened a company making web applications. I then moved on to corporate software where I was in charge of coding commerce and enterprise applications. At 23 I was doing full sys admin work. I'm now 28 and I'm working doing UX, Design, Web Dev, Backend Dev, and little Sys Admin stuff. I'm rusty in the Sys Admin area, but I'm definitely more productive than the average CompSci graduate with a few years experience.<p>I'm pretty sure there MUST be a person better than me in all those areas, but not because I'm not a master of my skills, but because there is just always someone better. Becoming a Designeer happens only if you have the time (a decade?), and the inclination (interests in the right fields and skill sets at the right intervals in time) to learn the things you need to learn to do the job. Of course, there's also the fact that you need to be lucky enough to have people to hire you to do those things so as to get enough quality experience performing the tasks you need to perform.<p>Interestingly enough, I'm in the office right now... and this is the list of stuff I've done today: 
1) Finished coding a Windows service that acts as a data bridge between an two applications and three types of databases.
2) Worked a UX prototype for an IPad app (made in Keynote) that integrates with an in house product.
3) Finished a redesign for another in house app (this one is a ERP type WebApp).
4) Modified a series of E-cards the in house designers made because they where not optimized for email and had some alignment, whitespace, and typography mishaps.
5) Worked on integration of commerce hardware with 'special printers'.
6) I'm currently designing the visual aspect of an interface for yet another of our in house products.<p>BONUS: Yesterday I spent 3 hours securing the web servers for our website and a ticketing tool that our customers use.<p>I am by no means the best programmer, sys admin, designer, or UX architect, but I find all those roles are second nature for me and I have no problem getting a job (I literally get a call every couple of days by recruiters or companies offering me positions), and I only work in places I know I'll be having loads of fun and interesting challenging work. Designeers are not hard to get because they don't exist. They're hard to get because they want to make their own rules and work in things they actually want to work in. Offer them this and you'll invariably be able to score someone that will fill this often looked for but generally not realistic position.",1324406064

But the problem with the concept of a career track is that you are on a track defined by other people.  I'd say the only way out is go your own way as you have - career tracks all eventually end somewhere.  As a generalist you have a much broader perspective on how to create your own track and a much better vision as to what direction best suits you.  I think probably the best way we can encourage up and coming tech generalists is to encourage them to get frustrated with the status quo and to become entrepreneurs.

(I managed to find <i>one</i> job that would, and for that I'm forever grateful.)<p>Once I picked up some experience designing UIs, the top companies wouldn't would take me seriously until I had some formal design training and credentials. So, I went back for a degree in Interaction Design.<p>Once I finished my degree, the top companies wouldn't take me seriously until I shipped some code that had my own designs in it. So I did that for a while, in a few hybrid dev/designer positions.<p>Once I shipped my code, the top companies wouldn't take me seriously until I had shipped a design of my own creation that was also my own (so, owning the UI, UX, code and business strategy). So I got back into entrepreneurship (something I'd largely given up with my pure CS focus), and started creating and shipping my own designs.<p>Now, as an entrepreneur, interaction designer and computer scientist, the top companies won't take me seriously until I start shipping designs of my own creation that are also visually stunning. Working on it. :)<p>--------------------<p>Only now, six years later, do I realize that no one will ever take you seriously unless they can <i>define</i> you.
Programmers can be understood, and slotted. They have real, respected career paths. Designers can be understood, and slotted. They have real, respected career paths as well. Even Interaction Designers are slowly becoming understood.<p>Being a desingineer, while bringing me incredible amounts of joy, also feels absolutely terrible - because people are constantly coming along with ideas of what you can or should bring to an organization. The limits of the position are such unknowns, in fact, that sometimes people feel desingineers should be <i>everything</i> to everyone.<p>Sometimes that comes out of with a sense of greed - after all, it's on the desingineer to prove they <i>shouldn't</i> have to do all of those things, right? And, in fact, they feel <i>entitled</i> to everything. Early-stage startups are particularly bad about this, I've noticed - their ""first designer hire"" posts often forget that everyone starts somewhere. (Sorry, but it's true.)<p>But other times people simply misunderstand how long it takes to become good at each of the individual skill sets involved. And other times companies are still sorting out what skill sets their companies actually <i>need</i> in the same person.<p>-------------------<p>Is there anything we can do, as a community, to bring some clarity and definition to ""desingineering"" - so kids coming out of school don't have to go through what I have gone through? It's obvious that this is a position that companies need, but it's not one that will be treated with respect until its own practioners - a fair number of whom seem to be on HN -  actively come together to help define it.",1324404562

It's simply not effective to have a single person context-switch between them, even when said person is very good at both. I.e. this is one of the situations where two people can indeed produce a given result nearly twice as fast.<p>However, I also agree that on top of that discipline plays a role, too.<p>While wearing the engineer-hat you have to constantly force yourself to stick with the brain-damaged abstractions that comprise todays ""state-of-the-art"" and not give in to the urge of fixing them bottom-up.<p>I.e. when both front- and backend are in your hands then the temptation to make the frontend truly model-driven can quickly become overwhelming (auto-generate those stupid forms and validations! why mirror when we could just rpc!). Sadly more often than not this results in a huge time-sink, as you embark in an uphill battle against a tool-chain that's strongly optimized for the exact opposite.",1324404558

The most serious problem is that it treats single characters as ""words"", despite the fact that the vast majority of modern Chinese is disyllabic.

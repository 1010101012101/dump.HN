The software/robotics crowd is maybe only a decade old (ignoring the hacking scene). Why wouldn&#x27;t we in a hundred years or so be able to write our own car control software? Or more importantly, why shouldn&#x27;t we?<p>I also disagree on your stance that open-sourcing it wouldn&#x27;t improve anything. If anything, open-source has been the driving force behind great procedural advancements in software design: source control, code quality measurements, unit testing, metaprogramming, have all been influenced or driven by large open-source projects. If anything, I think the first thing an open-source movement for car control software would produce is testable code, probably from a greater focus on compiler-enforced design-by-contract languages.<p>In my mind, the only reason we wouldn&#x27;t be able to progress to that point is exactly because of these anti-reverse-engineering policies, because of IP protection and litigious manufacturers. I&#x27;m firmly with the EFF on their Freedom To Tinker cause, and I think it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for the EFF to take this case as an example of why current policies are wrong.",1442915448

It means you have low standards for an economic system.<p>That&#x27;s pejorative and uncalled for. There&#x27;s nothing in that post that indicates those choices are either poor or short sighted, just that they are motivated by the exercise of free will. What alternative criteria would you impose on the poster&#x27;s decisions?<p>>You could just as well try to argue that every word out of your mouth doesn&#x27;t require justification simply because you accept it all as true without it. Well good for you.<p>I&#x27;m deeply concerned about your blatant disregard for the freedom of expression of others. Who should the poster be _required_ to justify their words to? You?<p>Capitalism is only one characteristic of our modern global economy out of many. Typically developed western countries have capitalist corporate structures, regulated markets, centrally planned social welfare systems and the occasional monopoly. Capitalism is justifiable on two premises.<p>The first is the exercise of freedoms. The freedom to own your own property and invest your own earnings and property as you see fit is a basic right that is widely recognized in the western world. It&#x27;s hard to see how restricting or curtailing that right can be morally justified. The second premise is that capitalism is overall an efficient way to allocate resources because it engages the creativity and energy of the maximum possible number of people rather than restricting it to a politically selected few. And yes, Capitalism does engage a vast swathe of the population. The local shop owner down the road I buy my milk from is just as much a capitalist as any banker. That doesn&#x27;t mean capitalism allocates resources perfectly, just that it&#x27;s more efficient than the other methods that have been tried. As Winston Churchill said of Democracy - it&#x27;s the worst system, except for all the others.",1442915414

I don&#x27;t think any of us could imagine that it would improve.&quot;<p>1. 99.99 percent of the owners of these automobiles wouldn&#x27;t have a clue to even where to access, or what to do with the code?  Most can&#x27;t find their AlDl, or OBD plug.<p>2. Most  mechanics out there don&#x27;t know much about car computers, and 99.9 % know nothing about programming.  When something goes wrong with the computer; they just replace it. When  I was in automotive school, the failure rate of car computers were 1 in a million.  I think that&#x27;s low though? Mechanics just replaced the computer--hopeing they got the right one.  The one in the vechicle was usually fine, but was shorted out by fat fingers, and hangovers.<p>In real life, when a mechanic, usually erroneously blames the automobiles computer, as the fault of the problem, he/she just replaces it.  Their biggest achievement is not shorting the new computer in by installing it.  Of course when they short out the computer, they blame the computer as defective, and charge the customer.<p>Dealership mechanics(some) can reflash their particular brand of vechicle computer/computers, but they don&#x27;t code anything.  They push a GUI button, and answer yes, or no  questions the enginneers at corporate programmed.<p>As to propriatiry software, it&#x27;s not about safety, and reliability.  It&#x27;s about customers being held hostage to the dealership.  You buy a fancy car, with a bunch  of do-dads on it.  You can&#x27;t just bring your ailing car to any independent mechanic.  They don&#x27;t have access to the computer system.  Most wouldn&#x27;t have a clue to the actual code, but they need trouble codes.  These trouble codes are being held hostage.  The dealer will happily fix your car, but at dealer prices.<p>Even if people abused the open source software(affecting emmissions), it would be caught at the bi-annual smog check?  As the safety, the automobile companies would love to blame tampered with software in order to lessen their liability? (It sounds like it would be pretty easy to test for altered code, on the manufactures end?) For years now, I can buy computers that improve a vechicles performance, but it&#x27;s just not worth not passing an emmission test--in my view.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about safety, It&#x27;s about greed. \nAnd maybe other factors; like they don&#x27;t want the Programmers peering into their horrid code.  Code that defeats smog checks.  Code that reuses other manufactures patents--without payment? Code that is just terribly written, and causes numerous accidents, and thefts?<p>Again, I don&#x27;t want much.  I just don&#x27;t want to essentally lease my vehicle after buying it with cash?  What?  Yes,  because no one other than the Dealership can work on it at $170 hr.  The idependents will attempt to work on my new vechicles, but they never seem to solve the problem.  Why should they, they don&#x27;t have the information!  These automobiles have gotten so complicated, even your dealership mechanic is usually figuring out your cluster of sensors on your dime.  It&#x27;s gotten to be quite a racket?  I forsee acres, and acres of newer automobiles that are junked because they aren&#x27;t worth fixing?  Give out trouble codes?  Give out a  service manual with every new car sale.  Tell the  customer  up front, &quot;I will see you again sir, for many years--let me program all our dealerships into your GPS?&quot;  &quot;I hope you never lose that high paying job?&quot;  &quot;Your so good looking, why would you ever want to get your cute hands dirty working on that dirty automobile?&quot;<p>Give me access to my computer on my car, at least the trouble codes, and access to a reasonably priced scan tool?

Part of this is because they must run lean in order to completely burn fuel and prevent soot formation. This results in very high NOx emissions compared to contemporary gasoline engines.<p>Typically, passenger diesels employ a urea injection system to meet EPA standards, which reduces NOx as a catalyst. This system adds expense and maintenance duties. VW claimed their small diesels could meet emissions standards without such a system. What they have actually admitted to doing is writing a complicated algorithm that detects the conditions of a CARB emissions test and modifies running parameters in order to reduce NOx to acceptable levels during the test. This isn&#x27;t in dispute by any party.<p>As emissions are not tested during typical driving scenarios, and given that CARB and the EPA has measured 40x the acceptable level of NOx, I speculate that VW is enriching the fuel-air mixture when their algorithm detects the conditions of an emissions test; this would dramatically reduce NOx emissions at a measurable cost to fuel economy.<p>As other automakers—such as Mazda with their perpetually delayed Mazda 6 diesel—are having trouble developing urea-free diesel engines for the US market, it is no wonder that someone noticed the discrepancy between USDM and EUDM emissions numbers for these vehicles.<p>Note that the EPA does not perform emissions testing of its own; automakers self-certify.

I haven&#x27;t used Numba, but after my experience with others I conclude that you just can&#x27;t totally escape the fact that CPython is slow. Having to use tools like Cython is a big tax that&#x27;s cost me weeks or months of time.<p>Firstly numpy/scipy don&#x27;t help if you can&#x27;t write your algorithms in terms of operations on multidimensional arrays, and numpy overheads (creating and accessing ndarrays) are actually prohibitively large if the arrays aren&#x27;t large, easy to be slower than straight Python.\nFirst I tried writing code (scientific stuff) in type-annotated Cython. But it turns out that data structures are the bottleneck if your algorithms need to read/write something other than a bunch of numpy ndarrays. If you try to use lists, dicts, etc, you still go through the Python runtime so get little speed benefit over Python. (Cython optimises ndarray accesses.)<p>So I ended up writing C++ code and interfacing to it using Cython. But now I have to write a huge amount of code to translate between the Python/Numpy and C++ datastructures. And it&#x27;s bug prone due to memory allocation and ownership. Using multiple poorly compatible languages is a miserable experience. Julia sounds fantastic. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, I love Python, but it wasn&#x27;t designed for scientific computing.

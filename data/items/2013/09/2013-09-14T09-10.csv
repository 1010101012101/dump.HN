6385164,comment,6366452,6381719,1,0,agumonkey,,,"I think state centric system have been the main metaphor since data is processed through machines. Maybe Hickey and others are living in one side of the universe, but he did use other systems before creating clojure, and does not reject all state, just accidental/unnecessary state.<p>Sorts are not a good example here I think. QS correctness is uncoupled from its in-place property[1]. And they&#x27;re encapsulated processes, nobody is supposed to see intermediate internal state. This black-box state is not the problem addressed[2]. All your examples are &quot;single threaded&quot;. Two blind people moving chairs around will be a problem when one will try to sit down where there was one. Mutation and sharing is the problem otherwise nobody cares. That&#x27;s why temporary variables are nasty in imperative friendly languages, any variable became an opportunity to mess up data needed by someone else.<p>It&#x27;s also a logical waste, as in the first Java example, you don&#x27;t need to compute the uppercase variant of a string unless it&#x27;s needed down the road, if it is required then you pass it as argument to doSomething, that&#x27;s what function are for.  I tried to, but I&#x27;m not sure I understand the point of the second code example, because java references means x and original are the same, if you want an in-place uppercase method then both x and original are now uppercase letters, but you want to keep both values ... (Not really communication friendly)<p>The &quot;focus&quot; object would be a way to denote a place where all methods would accumulate state change ? I never saw this in the light of stack based language, it&#x27;s interesting.<p>[1] the FP expression for quicksort is obscure the first time, but when you click you can&#x27;t &quot;unsee&quot; it
[2] many lisp books explicitely say that this is acceptable because it doesn&#x27;t leak out of the functional interface, referentially transparent as far as calling functions are concerned",1379152773

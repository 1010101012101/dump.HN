I've read it cover to cover and it's great background for further reading in philosophy, but it's a dry start.  Russell's <i>Unpopular Essays</i> is a good deal more fun to read.<p>Other things I'd recommend for wading into the waters of philosophy would be <i>Utopia</i> by Sir Thomas More, or <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> by René Descartes.",1278752343

ANTLR needs strange hacks to parse Python with its whitespace indentation. A handwritten parser just needs some context within the lexer.<p>In my eyes a parser generator is the solution, if you want to trade efficiency for cross-language-portability. ANTLR is probably the best solution at this point, though the C backend is quite wierd.",1278752204

I'm not an expert at anything: I have no work experience and maybe two serious computer science courses under my belt, but GEB really satisfies an intellectual curiosity I've had for years.  I'm 550 pages in (out of about 750 pages) and with the exception of the two chapters discussing the anatomy of the human brain (a subject I'm just not that interested in), I've torn through this book—I only started reading about three months ago, which means I've been reading GEB much faster than any other book I've ever opened.

As a rationalist seeking a solid basis for ethics in the physical world, I've found both authors quite instructive.  Perhaps ""Objectivity"" by Nicholas Rescher belongs here as well.<p>There's a whole other class of what I call ""idea books"" and I've seen a few of them listed in the comments, too.

I'm currently re-reading it.<p>Here are a few reasons why i liked it:<p>-It was the first book on philosophy i actually read. The closest book on philosophy i ever had contact with before was a high school textbook and it was more than horrible.<p>-I read it with a deliberate reason, i was interested specifically in why some people are bad with tech, actually not just bad but horrible with it. Where does this gap come from?<p>-I read it at a point in my life when i was trying to figure out a lot of stuff, and one of them was how to not be an arrogant asshole, i found that it was way too easy to be one towards people who i perceived as less intelligent than me. I approached this book searching for ways to enhance my reasons to be arrogant, but left it with a sort of humility and understanding towards others that i didn't know i was capable of.<p>-Because of my obsessiveness and extreme rationalism, it was easy for me to connect with the character of Phaedrus.<p>-It was a novel, not a philosophy book, it was light to read, and at the same time intellectually stimulating.<p>Maybe you should ask yourself why is it that you don't like it? I'm curious for the reasons, it certainly has its flaws, and i still have difficulty with some of the ideas after the second re-read, but i never found it not entertaining.",1278750848

It can be used to provide better driving directions so that you are directed to nearby parking structures instead of the destination itself, when there isn't parking at the destination.

Sometimes that means taking a bottom-rung software engineering position at Google, and sometimes it might mean being CTO of a startup.  The answer depends a lot on what you've already done before, what you want to do in the future, and what specific skillsets you've identified as needing practice.<p>I've found that in general, it's harder to blaze a trail than it is to follow in other really smart people's footsteps.  OTOH, there's something intrinsically educational about that difficulty itself.  A lot, too, depends on whether you find yourself stagnating because you can't identify areas where you could do better (a big problem for big-fish-in-a-small-pond) or whether you find yourself stagnating because you're too overcome with inertia to change your behavior (a big problem for small-fish-in-a-big-pond).<p>BTW, I've also noticed that many people who think they're overqualified for great companies when they get their offer find that they're not overqualified at all once they get in.

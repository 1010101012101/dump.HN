If JK Rowling spent 10 years writing Harry Potter and spent the next 50 years in total consumption mode she would have still produced far more value than if she had worked in a basic office job for 60 years. How many Rowlings are stuck in low value producing roles?<p>2) Medium-Large companies are incredibly risk averse to the detriment of the overall market. As such the money they tie up gets very low returns. Forcing a shift in this money into either individuals or into automation attempts would provide far greater returns at an increased risk to a few companies but not an increased systematic risk for the economy.",1412895317

There&#x27;s no isolation here, so you&#x27;re exposing people who may go and build this circuit to live mains.<p>Think about the pot, for example. If somebody built this, and stuck a normal potentiometer on the front of a box to adjust the voltage, they may not think to use a pot that has a high insulation rating between the handle and the wiper. You could get a nasty crack of line voltage DC through the pot handle via your squishy internals and down to ground.<p>The pictures are also a bit concerning - the big metal heatsinks are almost certainly live as transistor tabs are usually connected to one of the pins and you don&#x27;t seem to have isolating washers and grommets. I wouldn&#x27;t want to thread a screwdriver down between live heatsinks to get to the adjustment pot.<p>This sort of regulator is okay if it and everything it powers is sealed away so nobody can touch it, or if it&#x27;s powered via an isolating transformer. It&#x27;s an unusual configuration and it&#x27;d be unusual for people to know what must be done to be safe when building this circuit.

This is fishy. It&#x27;s possible, for instance, that an impurity in the ceramic causes a thermally insulating film to form at high temperature.

A prof used to came and blabber about internal commands and external commands without really explaining the difference because most likely she herself was a n00b. And we used to get excited if we ever got a 30-min lab session to poke around with Lotus-123, Wordpro, Foxbase or Turbo Pascal.  Then in grad college we got Novell Netware and some of us figured out how to crack into classmate&#x27;s home directories and play pranks.

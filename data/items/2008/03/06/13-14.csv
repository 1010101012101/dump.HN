130538,comment,130112,130112,0,0,jcromartie,,,"There are a number of kids in comp sci that are just in it to get a job when they graduate.  I've seen so many of my peers go through school and then just give up programming.  These kids fuel the JavaSchools, and when faced with a <i>real</i> comp sci program they are weeded out pretty quickly.<p>Unfortunately, the schools decided that programming students were too profitable to weed out so many of them with real curriculum.  That's when they invented the MIS degree.<p>People are free to like what they like, but why would you clog up the schools if you know you don't have a passion for it in the first place?  My wife was brave enough to switch majors after a few years of engineering school before deciding that she just didn't have her heart in it.  Other kids plodded along just because they were close to a degree that they knew they would never use anyway, but the piece of paper was more important than their happiness and sanity.<p>P.S.  This is a lot of observation from the ""outside.""  I did 2 years of college before I realized that my own ability to learn outstripped my school's ability to teach.  I got a hell of a head start on the few of my peers from high school that decided to stick with programming.",1204811835

What #3 means is if you go with a simple solution per #1, make sure you can migrate your data.<p>For example, I've seen many companies grow from using Excel to Access to SQL Server. This path seems quite natural, and despite the issues associated with Access databases designed by non-DBAs (ahem), the process generally works (with the assistance of those of us who get paid to help).<p>Company B's problem is they don't realize they've outgrown their system, and need to evolve to the next step. However, I think their solution (spreadsheets) should work perfectly fine for your two-man shop.<p>I duplicate this lifecycle in my own personal projects. I might start off tracking fitness in vim, and decide I want sums so I migrate to Calc, etc. I recommend using simple tools, well.<p>Do you think if you try to adopt a larger package before you're ready you might end up spending most of your time playing with the system instead of working (like a writer who procrastinates writing)?",1204810158

That's going to be a very tough sell, particularly if you're just starting out and have no management experience. Just as techies are suspicious of ""noobs"" with ambitious ideas but no code, so managers are going to ask you about your track record right from the start.<p>It's almost like you're saying ""I want to write a program which can create love, then educate people about being in love"" when really you should focus on a specific tool for a particular problem, like creating a dating website or something. Changing the insides of people's heads is the hardest thing you'll ever try to do, so something smaller would be a more achievable goal.<p>It's good to be ambitious, but equally you need targets you can hit immediately. Reduce the thing to its bare essentials then see where you can go with it.",1204809922

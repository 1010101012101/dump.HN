The value proposition is more that the company will send a courier to your home and take an unwrapped item to its warehouse to wrap then ship.  Fulfillment by amazon requires you to do the wrapping and shipping (to Amazon).  With that said, they only charge a $5 fee for this service, which seems unsustainable.",1409763577

My research instead turned up prices from $25 to $100.<p>So rather than a simple single button connected via usb, I found the best options have been:<p>* a usb numberpad (~$10)\n* a usb MCE infrared remote (~$15)\n* an amazon basics wireless mouse (~$5)\n* an rfid reader + 50 nfc cards (~$20)<p>In each case, the solution I landed on ended up being cheaper, more versatile and functionally superior to a single simple button.<p>For example, the wireless mouse is now an interface for a music playback machine. Originally I imaged just a single button which would start and stop the music. With the mouse I added the option of changing the volume using the mouse wheel.",1409763560

A statup is a company that lacks capital, and compensates that by an improved supply of other kinds of resources[1]. Compared to a mid-sized company budget, VC rounds are change money.<p>Red tape and government bureocracy are common examples of problems that can be solved with money (== people&#x27;s time, not competency), and nothing else.

Similarly with coding, there is an aspect of both engineering and creativity. If I had to choose between the two, building a bridge seems like the obvious answer because the end goal (generally) is not to create art and provoke imagination, but to engineer a certain task. Building anything, such as a chair, requires some level of creativity, and in the case of woodworking, is often considered art.

It makes sense for people to work on data entry, it makes sense for people to flip burgers, it makes sense to do a lot of things - but only while the people remain so cheap.<p>There are many jobs already that are impractical to do in USA, because of the minimum wage - they get done either by automation or by someone in much poorer countries, but never again by a US worker. If minimum wage goes from $10 to $15, then more types of jobs will join that.<p>The &#x27;entirely different&#x27; problem arrives when the true market rate of low skilled labor becomes negative - i.e., an automated process generally costs less than a manual process even if the workers would work for free or for basic shelter/sustenance (order of magnitude less than first world would call a livable wage).

However, the particular paper that Gelman comments on here the most, a paper still in press (not yet formally published) has turned into a dead link.

I was requested to remove this preprint temporarily, until the publisher has given explicit consent to publish it here. If you seek a preprint please send me an Email.&quot;<p>And I&#x27;ll note for the record that many of the papers by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and his co-authors continue to be available on his website,[1] whether published yet or not, but please be sure that he is allowed to carry out his agreements with publishers so that those papers stay available. The work of that group of authors is very important and will do much to improve the science of psychology.<p>Gelman also comments favorably in his blog post about the work of Uri Simonsohn and his colleagues, who have devoted much thought to the issue of &quot;p-hacking.&quot; Simonsohn is a professor of psychology with a better than average understanding of statistics. He and his colleagues are concerned about making scientific papers more reliable. Many of the interesting issues brought up by the comments on the article kindly submitted here become much more clear after reading Simonsohn&#x27;s various articles[2] about p values and what they mean, and other aspects of interpreting published scientific research.<p>Simonsohn provides an abstract (which links to a full, free download of a funny, thought-provoking paper)[3] with a &quot;twenty-one word solution&quot; to some of the practices most likely to make psychology research papers unreliable. He has a whole site devoted to avoiding &quot;p-hacking,&quot;[4] an all too common practice in science that can be detected by statistical tests. You can use the p-curve software on that site for your own investigations into p values found in published research.<p>He also has a paper on evaluating replication results[5] (an issue we discuss from time to time here on Hacker News) with more specific tips on that issue.<p>&quot;Abstract: &quot;When does a replication attempt fail? The most common standard is: when it obtains p>.05. I begin here by evaluating this standard in the context of three published replication attempts, involving investigations of the embodiment of morality, the endowment effect, and weather effects on life satisfaction, concluding the standard has unacceptable problems. I then describe similarly unacceptable problems associated with standards that rely on effect-size comparisons between original and replication results. Finally, I propose a new standard: Replication attempts fail when their results indicate that the effect, if it exists at all, is too small to have been detected by the original study. This new standard (1) circumvents the problems associated with existing standards, (2) arrives at intuitively compelling interpretations of existing replication results, and (3) suggests a simple sample size requirement for replication attempts: 2.5 times the original sample.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://ejwagenmakers.com/papers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejwagenmakers.com/papers.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.p-curve.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p-curve.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2259879"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2259879</a>",1409763381

And because Ritalin has very, very similar effects, including the side-effects like tremors and teeth grinding. So I was living the same sped up and fucked up life after all. Then I quit all of it which was followed by severe depression, while I never had such problems before that period of abuse. Depression, which afaik has been linked to dopamine functioning. Depression, which even years after the facts still sometimes wants to kick in. I&#x27;d almost say something is borken in my brain. Now I read an article saying use of MP might yield damage to dopamine neurons. Hey, sounds familiar.

GM needed it&#x27;s dealers to sell their cars. It&#x27;s a balancing act that the free market easily could have handled but the dealers and legislators took the selfish way out.

That means the BEAM VM is doing something very similar to the style of instrumentation Quasar is doing: it injects yields into your code at points it thinks are reasonable.  This is not quite the same thing as true preemptive scheduling as OS-native threads do.  Quasar could do this kind of safepoint injection as well, though afaik that&#x27;s not currently a feature.<p>Your definition of ponies and mine seems to diverge here, and that&#x27;s fine :)  I agree that true preemptibility is an even higher bar we can hold scheduling frameworks to.  But it&#x27;s also a very complicated area to get into, it&#x27;s not completely without it&#x27;s tradeoffs (full preemptibility pretty much gets us back to OS native threads, right?  and there&#x27;s very real performance reasons there&#x27;s so much momentum away from that right now), and I also feel that I can get <i>a lot</i> done with green threads without these features.  Maybe we&#x27;ll see a growing swing towards safepoint injection for psuedopreemptibility -- I&#x27;m just making words up at this point, as far as I know; if there&#x27;s a better existing terminology for these shades of grey I&#x27;d love a link -- in the coming years.

8263888,comment,8262617,8263834,3,0,pron,,,"AFAIK Erlang doesn&#x27;t even warn you if you call blocking C code. The way Quasar does it is as follows: every time a fiber becomes runnable, it has a counter incremented. Every once in a while (I think 100ms) a special (kernel) thread goes over all FJ&#x27;s worker threads and takes note of the fiber each is currently running and its counter (this requires some memory fences, but we take advantage of those already found in Quasar, so there&#x27;s no added overhead). If it encounters the same fiber, with the same count twice, you&#x27;ve got a &quot;runaway fiber&quot;, that&#x27;s either blocking, or spinning too long. You can further examine the thread&#x27;s state to see if it&#x27;s blocked or not, to figure out which of the two things is happening.<p>Just to clarify: it&#x27;s perfectly OK to call blocking code on Quasar fibers. In fact, it&#x27;s encouraged. But the blocking call must be &quot;fiber aware&quot;, and there&#x27;s a project called Comsat, that takes many popular Java libraries and makes them fiber-blocking without changing their APIs.<p>This leads me to another point, which is time-slice based preemption of fibers. That&#x27;s a feature Quasar had early in it&#x27;s evolution, but has since been taken out (Quasar is preemptive, but doesn&#x27;t offer time-slice scheduling). The reason is that time-slice scheduling is great when you have hundreds of threads running, but quite terrible when you have a million, because it means that the threads (lightweight or not) constantly compete for CPU cycles that the CPU just can&#x27;t keep up with. In Java, plain threads are still available (with the same API as fibers, i.e. new Thread vs. new Fiber etc.), so for long-running computations, you&#x27;re better off using a kernel thread; work-stealing scheduler aren&#x27;t great at scheduling such tasks anyway. In Erlang, you don&#x27;t have access to kernel threads, so time-slice scheduling is necessary to support the occasional heavy-computation process.",1409762547

8263876,comment,8256653,8256653,1,0,BrotherBrax,,,"Since many people are making (wrong) assumptions about Portuguese work laws, I&#x27;d like to chime in as a Portuguese guy working in IT and with good knowledge of these laws (I like to always be aware of my rights). The critical part of this argument is the &quot;at will&quot; period that Vasco (Unbabel&#x27;s CEO) mentioned, technically called an &quot;experimental period&quot; (EP). Here is a summary (in Portuguese -- the Google translated version is decent enough) of the relevant part of the law:\n<a href=""http://emprego.sapo.pt/guia-carreira/artigo/166/artigo.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emprego.sapo.pt/guia-carreira/artigo/166/artigo.htm</a><p>Also, here is the law itself in case you want to read it (articles 111 to 114, also in Portuguese):\n<a href=""http://www.legix.pt/Portals/3/docs/CT09-23_Jul_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legix.pt/Portals/3/docs/CT09-23_Jul_2012.pdf</a><p>The typical way to hire full-time workers in Portugal is indeed a full-time contract with an experimental period (EP), what Vasco colloquially called an &quot;at-will&quot; period. These contracts are called &quot;por tempo indeterminado&quot; (or sometimes &quot;sem termo&quot; or &quot;com termo incerto&quot;), which means &quot;for an indefinite period&quot;. The EP can last between 90 days (3 months) and 240 days (8 months) -- non-managerial roles get 90 days, which is what Andreas had on his contract (shorter durations benefit the worker). After the EP is over it is VERY hard, from a legal standpoint, to fire a worker, which is why the EP exists in the first place.<p>During this experimental period, the employer can terminate the contract with no advance notice and paying no compensation for the first 2 months. Between 2 months and 4 months (if the EP lasts that long), the employer must warn 7 days prior, or pay 7 days of salary as compensation. After more than 4 months, and until the end of the EP, it is 15 days. The worker can always terminate the contract with no notice during the EP. After the EP is over, the worker must provide 1 month of advance notice to terminate the contract, and the company usually cannot fire the worker at all.<p>According to Andreas&#x27; original post, he was fired after 1 month, during his EP, which means he is entitled to no compensation. Unbabel paid two extra weeks of salary (Andreas admits that in his blog post), which shows that they treated him better than the law requires. If indeed he was also paid $1000 extra (from Vasco&#x27;s post), that is even further above what the law requires.<p>Andreas&#x27; blog post suggests that he thought he had a 3-month contract, which he did not. Legally, he could even be fired after 1 day on the job, and get paid 1 day and nothing more. While Unbabel may be slightly guilty of not explaining correctly what Andreas signed, I still believe that Andreas has the majority of the blame for not understanding what he signed or searching around what are the typical work laws in Portugal. Heck, if I went to Sweden, I&#x27;d ask for an English translation of the contract from someone outside the company, even if the company itself provided an English translation. What happened with the landlord seems to confirm this, since he had the legal right to stay for as long as his deposits lasted, and simply calling the police (no need for a lawsuit) would ensure that he could stay until his deposits ran out. It is, again, very hard to evict a person just like that.<p>In summary: Unless I&#x27;m missing something here, Andreas was treated considerably better than required by law and has no legal grounds for complaining.",1409762407

8263797,comment,8256051,8258227,2,0,benlc,,,"A few years ago, I tried to launch a service back in France similar to all these ride sharing companies that work with taxis rather than private drivers ( I guess the most comparable in the US market would be FlyWheel ). Things went downhill for us pretty quickly but I learned a lot about the taxi industry, how universally bad it is and why.\nIn most countries you go, you&#x27;ll notice that getting a cab is not a great experience. Small cities ( very roughly less than ~100k inhabitants ) have local companies. They&#x27;re ran by local businesses that mostly depend on the quality of their service to survive. They also need to provide an ok job for their taxi drivers. This is why the service is usually more reliable and the quality of your rides is typically higher.\nLarger markets are much more interesting and suffer from monopoly, which often leads to what can be called mafia companies. The taxi industry is old. Very old. Small taxi companies grew from a few cabs to often controlling a third of the city they&#x27;re operating in ( sometimes even more ). Laws restricted smaller guys to get into business over the past decades which we can probably put on lobbying. The lobbying part is always difficult to prove but simply looking at the stats talk by itself. Medallion are universally so expensive that taxis are forced to go through these companies that already control the market. This is a quote from wikipedia regarding NYC medallions : &quot;Because of their high prices, medallions (and most cabs) are owned by investment companies and are leased to drivers (“hacks”)&quot; : <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_the_United_States#Yellow_cabs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_the_United_States#...</a> . This is more representative of the US and a few european markets but it points out why many of these companies have been running without any competitors for half a century. Where it gets interesting is that many cities have just as many medallions today available for purchase as there were 50 years ago when the market was half the size. So why can we define these companies as Mafia ? Well it depends. Sometimes it is actual Mafia ( in South Africa you might feel safer in a township rather than in a taxicab, no joke. ). On more developed countries, these companies simply have control on our local governments. Las Vegas is the perfect example : taxi drivers are pissed because they&#x27;re not getting paid crap and are even being taken a percentage of their tip ( either they get one or not ) based on their fare... When it comes down to introduce competitors ( Uber, Lyft, Sidecar etc... ), it usually is a lengthy battle since these companies refuse to match what the taxi companies pay our local governments. I could go on and on but every market has their own things going on and iterating over old legislation rather than keeping up with modernity put the taxi industry in a very bad place.<p>Anyway, sorry for the long answer. I currently work to one of the major ride sharing companies (I won&#x27;t mention which one but this time I&#x27;m working with private drivers instead of actual taxis), and I&#x27;d love to share some of the stats we often have access to but it&#x27;s obviously confidential...",1409761677

So when a new episode of Game of Thrones comes out, the first person to get it forwards it to everyone else in the swarm and the download gets exponentially faster with each peer.  Bittorrent could easily (and probably is in some implementations) tuned to favor low latency, which would start with the nearest peers.  Sure a CDN accomplishes the same thing, but it’s a larger sunk cost than using a few spare megabytes on people’s hard drives.<p><i>The connection from your home to the ISP is anything but a one-time cost.</i><p><i>In fact the last mile to your home is the most expensive part of your Internet connection.</i><p>This has been used as an excuse to slow the rollout of broadband for a long time.  I remember when they installed the new orange fiber optic cables along the freeway where I live back in the 90s.  It must have been a monumental task.  And they are a permanent choke point, with the internet growing year after year, so the fee to use those lines can really only go up until more are laid.  They are the reason that some ISPs limit traffic to 200 GB per month, not the load on the router for your last mile connection.<p>And yes, the sunk cost of the last mile connection is also expensive, but it’s amortized by future subscribers getting connected.  But at some point, the rate of new subscribers will fall to the point where even that is negligible.  I think we passed that point sometime in the late 2000s, about the time that my mom got broadband in her town of 15,000.<p>The cost of maintaining a substation and routers for hundreds or thousands of subscribers against their monthly subscription fees of $50-100 per month doesn’t pass the sniff test.  Most of the costs are going to be in tech support and installation, and ISPs are notorious for taking too long to make this stuff plug n play so I don’t have any sympathy for them there.<p>ISPs are punting now, because it’s cheaper than making the last push to get everyone connected at the 100 Mb speeds the cable lines are capable of.  They don’t want to lay new backbone, and I can’t blame them there.  But the internet finds a way, and if it weren’t for the legal shenanigans of companies like HBO shutting off people’s internet, protocols like Bittorrent would have become a mainstream layer below HTTP years ago.  So why would laws like the DMCA exist?  To spawn the CDN industry and pour billions of dollars into building data centers that are largely unnecessary, by giving companies the legal leverage they need to pitch it.",1409760513

Such functions and methods tend to accomplish easily understandable things. And by &quot;important&quot; I mean something that is fundamental to what the system accomplishes.<p>Then you dive.<p>Your goal is to have a decent understanding of how this fundamental thing is accomplished. You start at the public facing function, then find the actual implementation of that function, and start reading code. If things make sense, you keep going. If you can&#x27;t make sense of it, then you will probably need to start diving into related APIs and - most importantly - data structures.<p>This process will tend to have a point where you have dozens of files open, which have non-trivial relationships with each other, and they are a variety of interfaces and data structures. That&#x27;s okay. You&#x27;re just trying to get a feel for all of it; you&#x27;re not necessarily going for total, complete understanding.<p>What you&#x27;re going for is that <i>Aha!</i> moment where you can feel confident in saying, &quot;Oh, <i>that&#x27;s</i> how it&#x27;s done.&quot; This will tend to happen once you find those fundamental data structures, and have finally pieced together some understanding of how they all fit together. Once you&#x27;ve had the <i>Aha!</i> moment, you can start to trace the results back out, to make sure that is how the thing is accomplished, or what is returned. I do this with all large codebases I encounter that I want to understand.

For example I think the original post&#x27;s high level view would work great when starting a new job as well as when diving into an open source project.<p>That said one step down the chain from stack traces and profiler output might be to look at log files, or run the code in verbose/debug/trace mode if it exists.",1409760057

With enough land, anyone can support themselves: chickens, vegetables, hunting and fishing, etc.<p>Mortgages in exchange for housing (&quot;death pledges&quot;) exploit the poor, indenturing them to overemployment at insufficient wages.  The novelty and promise of technology are part of the system that works like a carrot on a string enticing us toward so-called &quot;higher standards,&quot; which we only think we need.  The rest of the system is security/fear.  These are the forces governments and corporations use to keep themselves secure.  Anything we&#x27;re going to do to escape it will be much more like what Jesus of Nazareth, Gandhi, Martin Luther Kind or Malcolm X did than what Paul Graham or Scott Adams did.<p>Technology and SV makes an easy whipping boy because they&#x27;re in the crosshairs of the media (all the &quot;billion dollar&quot; buyouts), but we&#x27;re just another pawn in the game the powerful landowners, governments and corporations are playing.  In fact, we&#x27;re playing along to <i>their</i> rules.",1409760000

I&#x27;ve noticed the same and it has annoyed me. When writing my own application code I do maintain a consistent pattern for returning my own errors, but I have been frustrated when consuming the stdlib for this very reason.<p>Maybe as my code base grows I&#x27;ll come to agree with you, but for now at least it seems to be at a nice middle ground where the error handling isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it isn&#x27;t swept under the rug. And to my knowledge, none of the bugs I&#x27;ve created when writing Go code have come from my understanding of the program flow being interrupted by error handling code.

You may be right that Christianity has just as much potential to be used to justify Christianism - but as you and I both agree we now have very few nations AND very few violent revolutionary groups seeking to replace existing governments with ones organized along a &quot;Christian political structure&quot; whatever that may be. I was trying to say that Christianity doesn&#x27;t COMPEL large swaths of the population at any given point to strongly support a political revolution towards Christianism, which is why the separation of Church and State is rather stable. Whereas I feel that the QuRan among its contents contains prominent instructions as to <i>how a polity is to be set up</i>. Christian writings have this too but the organizational principle is more akin to anarchism so whatever the political leaders wind up using isn&#x27;t from the NT. Don&#x27;t you see a difference in the nature of the writings at all when it comes to political structure, conquering and physical violence? I will give one example:<p><a href=""http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=8&verse=67"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=8&verse=67</a><p>Tell me where do you have a comparable verse in the NT? These pronouncements have been interpreted to apply to modern times as well, since Muslims are to emulate Mohammad. That is what I mean.<p>Look I could be wrong and at the end of the day the only danger I see is in the political and violent aspects of the writings, as something that makes it hard to separate Mosque and State given enough people. It&#x27;s a &quot;rule of the game&quot; that you can&#x27;t jettison as easily as Christians can. That&#x27;s what I meant.",1421164384

I think this is one of the biggest things we&#x27;ve lost to 9/11, decency and restraint.  It was first OK to talk shit about Muslims, Towelheads (sadly many more peaceful Sikhs were victimized by actual violence than Muslims), then Scientologists, then Mormons.  What the hell happened to our ideals?<p>I recall receiving an e-mail from a KKK affiliate.  It was a rational argument that a significantly larger proportion of the black population was incarcerated as compared to whites.  The e-mail stated that see it on TV shows like cops who perpetrate heinous crimes.  It then went to state that it&#x27;s not about being racist.  It&#x27;s about taking a stand...  I replied with a long rant countering every point and was obviously unsubscribed from the list.<p>Now let&#x27;s apply that template to other minorities.  Hmmm, skin color is too obvious, let&#x27;s do religion instead.  &quot;Did you see how most scientologists are crazy?  They jump on couches...&quot; It&#x27;s not racism since you&#x27;re not targeting a race.  But it&#x27;s the same fucking thing.  You&#x27;re singling out a minority group.  While you might not personally like a minority group, one not as powerful as the group you belong to, our society did not publicly attack minorities (I&#x27;m talking about the 90&#x27;s).<p>It seems the only things that still haven&#x27;t crept in are outright racism against a different race (probably because racial minorities are more powerful now).  But we are now taking pride in offending and trying to decimate the views that aren&#x27;t mainstream.  WTF is that?  Did we forget what that type of vitriol led to the last time around?<p>Can you seriously compare the socioeconomic conditions of the average Mormon to a Muslim from Iraq or Afghanistan?<p>I&#x27;m amazed that I&#x27;m reading comments on HN comparing 1.7B Muslims and trying to judge them as a whole.

The very concept of trigger warnings are costly: Anytime you want to voice an opinion, you&#x27;re forced to enumerate all the possible ways every reader might be offended or triggered or upset by what you&#x27;re saying. It&#x27;s an unscalable solipsistic self-centered notion that implies people are not in control of their own feelings and emotions and how things affect them (I say this as someone who has dealt with mild PTSD). Trigger warnings on banal content trivialize the whole thing, and encourage people not to help themselves.<p>Getting triggered sucks and is painful and throws everything off balance and is just a horrible thing to experience. But only a fool feels those things and blames the stimulus that brought up the associations. The last time I felt those feelings, I realized that I needed to get help or I was always going to be a broken, unhappy, scared person.<p>The problem as I see it comes from the fact that a bunch of teenagers on tumblr co-opted trigger warnings from legitimate uses (like on PTSD and abuse forums) and started applying them to idiotic things like fat shaming and otherkin.",1421162481

That&#x27;s the cutoff where, in my experience, subsequent scans by other tools just don&#x27;t find things.<p>I second the `what do you want to keep` sentiment, too. The downside to this is having them effectively sign off on what they want, and then they forget something until 6 months down the line. I have provision for keeping a drive image of their drives for 28 days, with prior permission, and I check in with them after 7, 14 and 21 days to make sure all is well. The comfort of a familiar desktop is a powerful thing, and the Windows Easy Transfer process makes it easy and straightforward.",1421161382

Only political control will keep AI monopolies from appearing.<p>B) the 49.5%: those lucky enough to get a job in one of the areas not taken over by AI.

My parents was Christian. They raised me a Christian.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until my late teens, when I got a job that I was exposed to a critical thinking crowd. They were very much willing to speak their minds, instead of showing religion some special-cased &quot;respect&quot;.<p>It made me think. It made me reconsider. I&#x27;m now an atheist.<p>But oh boy was the period in between then and now a interesting one. Somehow just asking yourself &quot;what if there <i>is</i> no God?&quot; felt so incredibly wrong and the mind many, many times tried to stop itself thinking that very thought. Confusion is certainly not a sufficient word to describe what went on then.<p>Anyway today I&#x27;m extremely thankful that people didn&#x27;t show me nor my religion &quot;respect&quot;. They treated me with reason, rationality and critical thinking even though they knew it might offend me. Now <i>that</i> is showing someone real respect!",1421161316

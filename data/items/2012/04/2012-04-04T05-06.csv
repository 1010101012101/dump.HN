So because the code is more consistent it is also easier to read and write (as opposed to say, dealing with someone's eccentric formatting).<p>Vim or emacs (the one I use) is available for any modern OS out there. It is free and has outstanding syntax highlighting and works through a terminal as far as I know.<p>In general it seems like this is a tail wagging the dog problem -- picking a language to work with (what seems to be   a broken) editor.",1333519174

Far more than anybody would like it to be.<p>The resources can be time/money/talent. So there is an intense bias on everyone involved in the project to under-estimate.<p>I usually work on low budget projects. You can actually accomplish a lot with a low budget. But as you start to climb the ""quality"" scale the costs increase much more quickly than the quality. To get a product that you might consider subjectively twice as good might cost ten times as much.<p>At core, I feel like there is a fundamental principal of information organization. It takes a certain amount of resources to undo entropy and organize information. When we experience a piece of work we can intuitively feel that entropy has been significantly reduced, we appreciate the accomplishment. (Even if we are not in the field of endeavor  we still feel it though we don't know how it is done.)<p>One specific point of difficulty in estimating time in music production is that there is an x-factor. It derives from the need to create something exceptional, which has both subjective and objective elements.<p>With an experienced production team you can predict how long it will take to produce something competent. But usually there is a point where we have all done the things we know how to do: the song is arranged, the players are good, the production environment is good, the instruments are good. But the song is missing something. What is it? It is not known yet. So an iterative trial and error process begins. Let's try a different singer. Maybe we should borrow my friends guitar. Let's keep recording. Let's rewrite the song.<p>Hopefully a solution is arrived at, but since it is a trial and error process it is impossible to estimate how long it will take.",1333518268

(You get nanosecond precision in measurements using only thousands of probe requests.)<p>The cloud angle to this is that deploying on Heroku / Slicehost / EC2 / etc would let the attacker, for the price of a stolen credit card (or less!), trivially get a local network vantage point from which to attack your application.",1333518235

3796287,comment,3793183,3793883,10,0,pcwalton,,,"In Rust we use the system libc with segmented stacks, and we call C code by switching stacks. (This has been observed to get us into trouble with the indirect branch predictor, unfortunately, but we plan on addressing that by duplicating the stack switching stub for each C function.) Go is similar (I looked at its code when implementing some of this stuff). So it's not true that having segmented stacks undermines Go's ability to interact with C code.<p>Note that another cool thing we can do is to statically link clang-compiled C code with Rust code and LLVM can inline your small C functions directly into your Rust functions and save you the stack switch -- this is one of the coolest things we can do with LLVM, IMHO.",1333516471

3796282,comment,3795483,3795483,2,0,motti_s,,,"I think the best way to learn about startups and funding is to hear what founders have to say. For this I recommend Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days by Jessica Livingston, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1590597141"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/d...</a>
While this isn't specifically about funding, many of the founders talk about their funding experience, because this tends to be a painful part for many of them.<p>As mindcrime mentioned in his comment, Brad Feld's Venture Deals is a great book, though focused on raising from VCs.<p>Another great source is not books but YouTube. The ""This week in venture capital"" series is usually interesting. For example here is the most recent episode, with Naval Ravikant, co-founder of AngelList: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_MJCASwsY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_MJCASwsY</a>
This way you don't only learn about startups and funding, but also about key players in the industry. I'm in the habit of watching those videos daily as I work out on my elliptical trainer... As I learn about a certain investor / founder in one video, I search for more videos of them. Some are more interesting than others. For example Mark Andreesen is always a pleasure to listen to.<p>If you prefer reading, some interesting relevant bloggers are Brad Feld, Fred Wilson, Chris Dixon and Mark Suster.",1333516385

3796278,comment,3795811,3795811,1,0,femto,,,"The article and project come across as so much being about building robots, as building tools which are capable of building physical things (including robots).  The emphasis is on the tools, not the product.  One can then ask the question ""where does the tool stop and the design begin""?<p>With proprietary CAD/EDA systems it's reasonably clear, in that the tools are typically in the form of binaries, so the tool is ""the stuff for which there is no source"".<p>With open source tools, it's much greyer.  Which side of the boundary does a library with source lie?  How does the boundary change with time?  Say you design a product with free software tools, then others build on top of that product.  Is your product now a part of the tool?<p>This, to my thinking is a competitive advantage of the open source design tools: products can be incorporated back into the tools used to design them, thus extending the tools and allowing the effort expended in the design to be reused.  It's also an area that seem to be largely neglected.  Library management is generally the weakest part of the open source EDA/CAD tools, at best trying to emulate the commercial library offerings, but ignoring the unique ability of open source to gather extensions in from the associated ecosystem.  Software tools at least some of this, in the form of collections like CPAN, github and so on.<p>I'm meandering here, but is anyone aware of an effort to do for the EDA/CAD world what github does for the software world, but even more than that to offer integration with the tools?  Sort of like Diaspora (peer-to-peer) meets github (distributed RCS with social) meets CPAN (integrated) meets OpenCores (EDA/CAD).",1333516255

That's before the losses due to a team of 4 vs. 3 (20% communications overhead?) and time to spin-up.

However, even government bodies that don't deal with ""secret"" information house lots of ""sensitive"" data whose public release would be a big deal.  Departments / agencies have lots of confidential and proprietary business information of the private companies they regulate and most agencies have truckloads of personal data belonging to their constituents.<p>To say that Google Apps, etc is a new and unique threat to it is silly though.  At this point between contractors and private infrastructure providers there is little or no government data that is handled only by government employees.<p>edit: Also, on the federal level one of the big pushes of the new CTO is for GSA to build out its own ""cloud"" of datacenters with which to host applications and house data for the rest of the executive agencies.  While the government might well hire could services from private companies, the goal is to warehouse data inside a government controlled environment.",1261713482

1014724,comment,1013155,1014197,0,0,gvb,,,"If you own the SVN repository, I agree, it works well enough.  However, if you don't have write privileges to the repository or if it is a shared repository with a lot of other people, it becomes much more difficult.<p>If you don't have write privileges into the SVN repository, you have no ability to revision control your changes without creating a tracking repository of your own.  Creating and maintaining a tracking repository is a hassle, especially compared to a DVCS where that is the normal operation.<p>If there are a lot of people with write access into your SVN repository, creating branches doesn't scale well because all the branches are public.  Creating a SVN branch for every experiment rapidly gets out of hand.  Again, you can create a separate tracking SVN repository (hassle) or you can use branches, but it is nowhere near as easy as with DCVSes.<p>The big difference with DCVSes is that scaling across lots of developers is not a problem, branches are strongly encouraged, and merging works <i>really</i> well.",1261711511

Luckily the proposal is about passing a 'fat pointer', really a pointer and a length.  I did that often in my C programs too:  int process(char *buf, int buflen);<p>Maybe this fix to C's Biggest Mistake, a.k.a. the 'fat pointer', is just syntactic sugar.",1261710519

C++ support in Clang has always lagged behind, but the Clang internals is all C++ --  as mentioned in the blog it isn't self-hosting yet, just self-building, but this is major step in making Clang a true replacement for GCC.<p>Compilers revolutions don't happen overnight, but rejoice, you are seeing one happen right now.<p>I personally can't wait to see systems like OSX & FreeBSD use Clang as their default compilers, which might happen in the next few years.",1261710449

This is a blog post consisting of 100% pure innuendo, serving only to turn a legitimate discussion (I'm not on MSFT's side here) toxic.<p>Flagged. Ride this off HN on a rail.",1243749583

Can we please give this a break?  We've been able to come to the conclusion that it's not uninstallable because of a limitation of Firefox, not something sneaky Microsoft is doing.<p>If you really just can't stand things like this, go ahead and jump off the Microsoft ship to Linux or Mac OS X.",1243749390

The problem is that as far as I know, there is actually support in the New Testament for blind faith - something about a doubting Thomas.<p>When fundamentalists say there's no morality outside of the bible, I've tried telling them to look at certain parts of the Buddhist scriptures (which in my opinion covers some of the moral parts of religion without the blind belief parts). But it just seems to go over their head. Anything outside the bible is suspect. If it seems to contradict the bible, it must be devilish. Etc.<p>Not every religion has a Kalama Sutta (also known as ""Buddha's charter of free inquiry"").",1243749170

The court rejected the employees' argument, viewing it as making every corporate officer a surety (guarantor) for the corporate obligations. Thus, the court found, that under general principles of corporate law, the officers of Nations Way were insulated from liability by the general principles of corporate and agency law.",1243749169

It takes too long to do the task in Photoshop (load into a stack, change canvas size, distribute layers, resize) and I can't preview the animation until it's saved and built in the game engine.<p>Any suggestions for a tool (free or paid) that would help stitch multiple frames into a sprite sheet?",1243748195

634466,comment,634112,634324,0,0,jfischer,,,"You are welcome. Actually, the inclusion of your processing module in 2.6/3.0 is an excellent example of a non-core developer getting code into the Python distribution. Your blog postings on the process (especially <a href=""http://jessenoller.com/2009/01/28/multiprocessing-in-hindsight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jessenoller.com/2009/01/28/multiprocessing-in-hindsig...</a>) really show how challenging it is to add something to a system that big (and ported to so many platforms). I appreciate the work you've put into processing (and one of these days I'll get around to using it).<p>Overall, the Python community strikes me as a bunch of really pragmatic, low-key people who have learned the hard lessons in the trenches of software engineering. To me, this is almost more important than the details of the language.",1243747931

Microsoft is competing with Google on search, Apple on OS and MP3 players, Sony and Nintendo on Game consoles, with open source on programming languages and Office Suites, Oracle and IBM in Databases, Logitech and Kensington on input devices, VMWare and Xen in virtualization...   The list goes on and on and on.<p>MSFT actually has a foot in the door at least in almost _every_ software market and some hardware markets.   That's seriously WTF as far as I'm concerned.

This has been their goal forever. The market for OS/Office & the rest of their old products, was pretty much destined to grow over 20 years. Keep your 90% share of a growing market and you grow.<p>Google don't know their goal. They make money on search. Search works and they still have power. They're still not making much from platforms or webapps or online publishing or any of the other noteworthy things they do good work on.<p>The search business is pretty much at perfection right know. But the odds that search will be (a) as important in ten years and (b) exclusive Google property in ten years is not a 1/100 bet. The strategy for increasing the odds in Google's favour is not clear. While they might imporve the monetisation slightly, I don't think the search market will grow that much. Keep your 90% share of a flat market and you don't grow much grow. You can still lose market share though.<p>Maybe this accounts for part of the difference between the two.",1243746560

Have an idea, write it down.<p>- I'd sit down and try to do just one thing. Look through the cards, find something easy. Even a little thing. After that it was okay to go to bed.<p>- Keep the code chunks small. Make it easy to page in all the state for working on that bit of code. Everything but the file that actually rendered a single bookmark fit on a single screen.<p>- Understand that some days you just won't get anything done. Go with it.<p>- Get something out there. Feedback is incredibly motivating.<p>- Relentlessly cut things back. What's the minimal amount you have to do. What can you remove? What can you get rid of? What's the minimal design that has conceptual integrity? If it's not necessary, get rid of it. I find that lopping off chunks of the ideas mean that other parts of the code and interactions with other parts of the system become less and less complicated.<p>- Don't start working on something until it's reasonably complete in your head. It's ok to doodle in code, but don't spend hours building something that is conceptually fragmentary. Sometimes I think about an idea for months. There are ideas I came up with 5+ years ago that I'm still noodling on.<p>- Keep an idea log. If you aren't working you aren't generating real ideas.<p>- Be ready to abandon an idea for another one if you find yourself thinking about it more.",1243746008

Beats by Dre, Bose, Nest, iPads & iPhone 6+&#x27;s, Flagship Samsung phones/smart watches, Thinkpad laptops, high end receivers, etc. Some of the pro audio stuff (amps, mics, etc) isn&#x27;t top-top, but for that honestly you are better off at a music equipment stores. So they would have to go uber high end, and that&#x27;s just not going to happen with their current brand image. That market is also <i>insanely</i> small and needs a correspondingly small footprint. Even closing 90% of their stores may not be enough.<p>Second is store size and location. Best Buys are enormous. They can have the high end glam to get people in the door, and still have room for the mid grade consumer stuff most people buy. These stores are larger yes, but rent/square foot are way cheaper than a little 1000 - 1500 sq ft Radio Shack. Street frontage and site location are terrible for radio shack. The closest one to me in Atlanta is sandwiched between a UPS store and a nail salon, at the very end of a strip mall with a grocery store as an anchor. Foot traffic must be <i>terrible</i>.<p>Boutique might could work, but a huge number of tiny retail shops are a giant albatross around Radio Shack&#x27;s neck.",1421359140

It is not because RSA is broken, but because the key sizes would have to be uneconomically large.<p>The key size requirements are picked based on the advancement rate of technology (mathematics, calculation power / price), and the time the data should stay protected. Many security related standards aim for several decades, and for RSA key sizes that does not look so good.<p>If the system is not already in wide usage, rolling out a major protocol that does not contain support for ECC at this time is a very, very bad choice. Many organizations have simply to disable it already because it violates the requirements.

The premise is that you go into areas that have high rates of (serious) crime, and do zealous enforcement of even minor crimes (graffiti, jaywalking), and that this sort of enforcement contributes towards the reduction of the crime that matters. It&#x27;s named for the premise that ostentatious signs of lawlessness and urban decay (like broken windows) invite further, more dangerous, disorder, like gangs staking out turf and assaulting/robbing people passing by.<p>This sort of policing policy is controversial in New York and is relatively uncommon in the rest of the nation.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, violent crime and murders in most of these predominantly-minority communities has been reduced substantially in the past several years. However, it seems to result in at least some members of the community feeling substantially more oppressed, and it does result in inequal treatment of minorities by police if for no other reason than geographic correlation.<p>(<i>Disclaimer.

8895644,comment,8894902,8895580,0,0,tptacek,,,"First, I&#x27;d be a little happier if you didn&#x27;t misquote me for the convenience of your comment. These <i>weren&#x27;t</i> my subheds. You&#x27;ve rewritten some of them, condensed others, added one, and misread another, which lead you to suggest that I hadn&#x27;t &quot;allowed for enumeration of zones&quot; when in fact there&#x27;s a whole subhed dedicated to it. You could just clarify at the top of your comments that your numbered list is your own, not mine. I&#x27;d then strike this part of my comment.<p>Now then:<p>1. I do not argue that the CA PKI infrastructure is working. In fact, I state explicitly that it is not. The problem is that DANE&#x27;s replacement for the TLS PKI is <i>controlled by world governments</i>. At a broader level, the problem is that centralized PKIs don&#x27;t work against nation-state adversaries. The solution for the TLS CA problem is (a) a race to the bottom for CA pricing, led hopefully by EFF, (b) widespread deployment of public key pinning, which serves both to thwart CA attacks and to create a global surveillance system against them, and (c) the eventual deployment of alternate opt-in TLS CA hierarchies, such that users could for instance subscribe to a hypothetical EFF CA hierarchy. DNSSEC accomplishes none of this.<p>2. Yes, DNSSEC is a government-controlled PKI. Your whole argument here is that if governments abused it, the Internet would &quot;route around it&quot;. You can&#x27;t make that argument without conceding my point.<p>3. I didn&#x27;t write &quot;DNSSEC is insecure&quot; (though I think it is). I wrote that it&#x27;s cryptographically weak, which it is: it&#x27;s PKCS1v15 RSA-1024. Crawl signatures back to the roots: you&#x27;ll see RSA-1024 all the way at the top of the hierarchy. TLS has already deployed forward-secure ECC cryptography and will by the middle of this year see widespread deployment of Curve25519 ECDH and Ed25519 deterministic signatures. DNSSEC simply will not: it will be RSA-1024 for the foreseeable future.<p>4. &quot;DNSSEC is expensive&quot; is not a subhed in my post. &quot;DNSSEC is expensive to adopt&quot; was, and it is: virtually no networking software currently handles soft failures from lookups, which are a universal shared experience among HTTPS users, and will occur just as frequently with DNSSEC (should it ever be deployed). &quot;DNSSEC is expensive to deploy&quot; is another point I made, which is also true: of the top 50 Alexa sites, why not go look how many are DNSSEC-signed?<p>5. &quot;DNSSEC is hard&quot; isn&#x27;t something I wrote at all, so I don&#x27;t know how to respond to it.<p>6. &quot;DNSSEC makes for DDoS&quot; is something I think is probably true, but also an argument I wasn&#x27;t willing to go to bat for, because amplification attacks using ANY queries against normal DNS also work. But sure, if you want to add fuel to the fire.<p>7. &quot;DNSSEC allows for enumeration of zones&quot; is captured under &quot;DNSSEC is unsafe&quot; in my post. If you answer to this is &quot;don&#x27;t use DNSSEC for important zones&quot;, then we agree, modulo that I think you shouldn&#x27;t use it at all.",1421358959

If race is one of the variables, then due to correlations created by society, race might be learned to be a negative signal, which is racist. If it isn&#x27;t one of the variables, it might be still inferred. For example, if your purchasing history is an input, there is probably a correlation between purchase of cosmetics for blacks and chances of incarceration, which, in turn affects your chances of loan repayment. The correlation between being black and buying, say, hair-care products for blacks is direct and causal (and completely non racist -- there is no effect on power), so this could be an almost perfect, and neutral, proxy for race, and, in fact, might be the best and simplest correlation the program could come up with.",1421358851

For bit.ly the parent zones are the .ly top level domain and the root zone. Each of them (but only these two) can forge valid DNSSEC records. With the current X.509 certificate infrastructure there are more than a hundred root CAs who can issue malicious certificates for use with TLS. Even though I certainly dislike the centralized nature of DNSSEC, it is hard to argue that reducing the attack surface from over a hundred institutions to two or three doesn&#x27;t constitute a marked improvement. Specifically, domains like tumblr.com whose domain path is completely US hosted will no longer have to worry about &quot;obscure&quot; foreign CAs like &quot;Unizeto Certum&quot;.<p>> In fact, it does nothing for any of the “last mile” of DNS lookups: the link between software and DNS servers. It’s a server-to-server protocol.<p>DNSSEC is decidedly not a server-to-server protocol. The signatures are created offline and can be verified by any party, even when they come out of a cache. In contrast, DNSCurve <i>is</i> a server-to-server protocol, which only secures the transport layer, but not the data itself. The post refers to the aspect, that stub resolvers (those software parts of your OS that look up the query at your ISP caching DNS server) where not envisioned by the designers of DNSSEC to verify the DNSSEC entries themselves. Nonetheless, there is nothing that hinders them from doing so and I would expect that feature to be included once DNSSEC is spread enough to justify the effort. In fact, you can already check how this would work using the dig request `dig @8.8.8.8 +dnssec example.com` which replies with the A record and the signature on the A record (you still need to get and verify the zone key of example.com though).<p>> DNSSEC changes all of that. It adds two new failure cases: the requestor could be (but probably isn’t) under attack, or everything is fine with the name except that its configuration has expired. Virtually no network software is equipped to handle those cases. Trouble is, software must handle those cases.<p>I&#x27;m curious about why software would have to handle these cases. For the end-user a binary &quot;lookup went well, here is the result&quot; / &quot;there were some errors during the lookup, sorry I can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t give you a result&quot; should be totally sufficient. Firefox should not confuse the user with detailed difference between &quot;I can&#x27;t verify this record, even though the parent zone says it is DNSSEC enabled&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t resolve the name at all&quot;, so why does Firefox need this information?",1421358582

DNSSEC is unnecessary, we have SSL.<p>Do you really want to argue that the CA PKI infrastructure is working? Placing your trust in your top domain solves 99.5% of the problem, roughly (considering there is about 500 CAs that you trust right now, that is not a made up number).<p>2. DNSSEC is a government-controlled PKI.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. It is ICANN-controlled, which is under government mandate but not government control. You already trust ICANN for the root zone, and they have so far stayed out of politics, and has so far never meddled with domains even when the US administration wants them shut down. Because if they did, the Internet would route around them in a heartbeat.<p>This is actually one thing that DNSSEC did absolutely correct. If you want a cryptographic assurance that a domain belongs to an owner, who better to make the assertion than the TLD responsible for delegating it? Sure, if you get a Libyan domain, you have to trust the Libyan TLD to sign it. But they are already trusted to delegate it! They run the whois. If they decide to transfer the ownership to Ghaddafi himself, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. If this is a problem for you, don&#x27;t get a Libyan domain name.<p>3. DNSSEC is insecure.<p>It&#x27;s ugly, but it&#x27;s not insecure in any practical way. It could be a lot more modern, but it is in no way worse than SSL (see 1 above).<p>4. DNSSEC is expensive.<p>It is already deployed. You are already paying the price for this, whatever it was.<p>5. DNSSEC is hard.<p>It adds complexity to your operations, but your tools already supports it and it&#x27;s included in courses already. No competing standard is.<p>6. DNSSEC makes for DDoS.<p>That wasn&#x27;t actually included in the list, but this one is true. DNS is a DDoS vector, and DNSSEC strengthens it. That should be addressed. Better deployment of filters would do much to improve the situation.<p>7. DNSSEC allows for enumration of zones.<p>Also not included in the list. Yes, this is a real issue you need to be aware of. Don&#x27;t store private data in public zones. Use split zones for this.<p>All technical decisions is a matter of pros and cons. Pro is that it builds on a proven infrastructure and is already deployed in most of the world. You could absolutely build a modern standard, but these things take at least ten years to roll out. Start today and build the successor to DNSSEC!<p>But remember that DNSSEC did get a few important things right: Assurance follows delegation. Your DNS operator does not have your key.

8895430,comment,8893554,8894058,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"The concept of CPS is a good one, as you say--they are specially trained to protect a very vulnerable segment of the population.<p>The problem is when CPS threatens to remove children from a home because the parents are not compliant with their commands. For example a CPS officer will show up to a home unannounced and demand to inspect it, based on an anonymous tip. If the parent says &quot;no,&quot; the CPS officer says, &quot;let me in, or I will remove your child from your home.&quot;<p>In contrast if a police officer came to your home, they would need a warrant from a judge to enter against the owner&#x27;s will. Do CPS officers need a judge&#x27;s warrant for the above demand? Everything I&#x27;ve read says no.<p>A police officer also cannot threaten to take property without a warrant. They can&#x27;t say, &quot;let me in or I will take your computer.&quot; If they want the computer, they need to get a warrant that specifically says they can take the computer.<p>So: it seems like parents have more rights to inanimate objects than to their own children, who are far more precious to them.<p>There&#x27;s also the matter of punishment without due process. Officers can get a warrant to take a computer only if they can show that the computer probably has evidence on it that will further an investigation. They can&#x27;t take a computer just to force the owner to comply with some other command.<p>Removing a child from a home punishes the parent. CPS has the power to do so even if they have no evidence that the child will show proof of abuse, or indeed without any tangible evidence of abuse whatsoever. They explicitly say that they are doing it only because the parent refused some other command, like to inspect a home or interview the parent.<p>And removing a child from a home is traumatic to the child. A computer doesn&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s going to the evidence room; a child will be confused and terrified. The emotional impact can persist for months or years even if CPS says &quot;oops!&quot; a day later and returns the child.<p>There needs to be a high standard for removing a child from a home. It absolutely should not be just another tool in the investigator&#x27;s toolbox.",1421356808

You have no way to express that, for instance, .handler is to be mandatory. Or if it is not mandatory, that it should default to &quot;dfl_button_callback&quot; or whatever.<p>Another thing you can&#x27;t do is distinguish whether x was initialized to zero by default, or whether it was an explicit .x = 0.  With the macro we know that since x isn&#x27;t defaulted, it came from the macro. Or if it is defaulted, it couldn&#x27;t have come from the macro. In the keyword arguments of the Lisp language, we know whether or not a keyword argument which has a default value was explicitly passed with that same value, or whether we are getting that value by default.<p>(In C++, which is somewhat offtopic because the subject is what is possible in C) we can do something clearer, if a bit verbose, by defining some framework for combining traits.

It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be ""almost correct"", afterwards a program with an error is just ""wrong"" (because in error).</i>",1283788754

I used to work for a startup that ended up belly, hmm, sideways, and the process a -lot- longer than I expected. Money ran out in November. In December, they laid off 10%, and then there was always someone to cough up some money to make the whole thing going, until June, when the company was bought up (and I said goodbye) - it took another 6 months for the new owners to decide to get rid off the team. It may have been lucky for us, but generally: belly-up takes time.<p>But, it doesn't really change the fact that your bosses appear to be not the nicest people in the world.",1283788754

1666881,comment,1661861,1666743,0,0,w00pla2,,,"> Large numbers of poor/mediocre teachers and small class sizes are not necessarily better than good teachers with larger class sizes.<p>I suspect that this probably referred to class sizes of 15 (small) and 30 (large). In South Africa, a small class is 35 and a large class is 80. It is quite a difference.<p>How do you think a teacher would keep rudimentary discipline in such a big class? You cannot even check their homework.<p>Learning a new language, it is important to talk it. In a class size of 80 people, each person would get 45 seconds to talk or answer a question in a double period (assuming that there was no lesson or any interruption otherwise). Learning a language would be impossible for these people.<p>> South Africa's densities are low because of apartheid planning. Segregation trumped density or sustaintability.<p>South Africa’s densities are low because South Africa only industrialized fairly recently and we have a natural low density (40 people per square kilometre).<p>> The lower life expectancy is due to HIV/Aids and it is similar to neighbouring countries.<p>I think that you set the bar artificially low when you compare with neighbouring countries (Civilwartorn Mozambique, Mugabe Zimbabwe and the Kleptocracies of Lesotho and Swaziland).<p>> In the (highly unlikely) event that the Apartheid government had survived, I doubt that the life expectancy figures would have been much better. (And the AIDS epidemic took hold under the apartheid government).<p>The NP government of De Klerk had a surprisingly good AIDS program (seeing as the disease was then a smaller problem).<p>You seem to gloss over Mbeki’s AIDS denial (he did not want to give pregnant mothers even Nverapine which would have prevented mother to child transmission of AIDS during birth). The courts had to be used to force the government to change.<p>Even Harvard University had a study which they claimed that Mbeki’s government <i>at least caused 300,000 deaths</i><i>. That is genocide. The world would have been up in arms if the Apartheid government had a similar policy.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/26/aids-south-africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/26/aids-south-afric...</a><p>> The Apartheid regime was not viewed as a benevolent dictatorship by the majority of South Africans (or the rest of the world),<p>So? Neither Singapore (or for that matter, Pinochet’s Chile) is/was viewed as benevolent dictatorships. All things considered, statistically the country was governed better than neighbouring countries.<p>> Instead, Apartheid was an organised state policy to further the interests of white people, at the expense of all others,<p>It is ironic that it is middle class white people whose </i><i>income grew</i>* the most in post-Apartheid South Africa (see again the Knight & XX study I mentioned) while unemployment and real salaries fell for black people.<p>So, if you complain about the enrichment of white people, the current government is doing a much better job of it. Income inequality increased significantly the past 15 years.<p>> deliberately dumbed-down black population, to keep them docile.<p>This is also debatable. The biggest expansion of tertiary education on the African continent (for both black and white people) occurred during the 70ies and 80ies. Even the TIMSS study (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) scores were higher in 1994/1995 than in the newer study. There are numerous international benchmarks which showed that the quality of education declined.",1283788724

1666861,comment,1666726,1666726,0,0,dragoon,,,"Let's get real about something: they're business guys, and you're the technical muscle, right? You seem young, and you're probably as good at sizing them up (note your ""great people"" comment) as the average MBA is at writing code; by this, I mean, not at all. Don't even try. Make your decisions based on hard facts, such as how much equity you have already and when you will start collecting a salary, and not based on ""warm fuzzy"" feelings of loyalty or how much you will get ""when times change"". Unless you're seasoned and have been in the business world for a decade or so, you are <i>way</i> out of your depth when trying to size such people and their promises up. (Of course you like them! Their job is to make people like them. They probably like you, but do they respect you?) Business people over-promise because the worst of them are sociopaths and the best of them have great intentions and are wonderful people but still are ridiculously overconfident, just because they have to be in order to succeed in that world.<p>They may be great guys, but you really need to get a firm commitment regarding equity. You're taking a risk and have a right to know what the rewards will be. A promise, especially a subjective one, means nothing. What does a ""big"" share even mean? If the company is valued at $2 million and you get 0.25%, that's a $5000 bonus, which can be described as ""big"" but is quite lousy in comparison to what you actually deserve. Remember that the business guys, due to the overconfidence that is characteristic of that sort, would still consider such a grant very generous. After all, it's going to be a $10 billion company one day, and that 0.25% is going to make you a millionaire many times over, no?<p>You're taking as much risk as they are, and you actually have the technical skills. You deserve a better deal. If your leaving would hurt them as much as you think it would, then they will give you equity, and they'll actually respect you more now that you're not letting them take advantage of you. Or, they might let you go, in which case you're better off to have this happen sooner rather than later, after having wasted even <i>more</i> time.",1283787791

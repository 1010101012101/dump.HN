Theyre working with 2 big acquirer banks which probably wouldnt do so if the company wasnt trustworthy. Might wanna think about that. Plus being available in 39 countries across Europe is more than beneficial for so many small business owners who previously did not have the chance to onboard with any other payment provider. But PAYMILL is there for them! Im a happy customer of theirs and have not experienced any kind of slight problem. In contrast, their support is very helpful, answeri ng all kinds of questions no matter how much youre asking. They even helped me generate my contract, adjusting it and sending it over to the bank for activation. So if you ask me - go for PAYMILL.",1377599075

It&#x27;d meet a lot of your needs, with no internet access, plenty of cold, and tons of outdoor stuff to do (and wolves, which might be considered a downside).<p>It was easy enough to arrange the homestay.  I booked it in Beijing as part of a trans-siberian trip, from one of the local outfits who arrange such things for English speakers.  I expect that if you did the same, you could probably arrange to be left in Irkutsk for a year and negotiate a long-term stay from there.<p>While we&#x27;re in the area, Mongolia is also really cool and would remove power and cell coverage from your list of unpleasant western things.  You could probably just outright <i>buy</i> a ger in Kharkhorin, and a horse to go with it, for a few thousand bucks.

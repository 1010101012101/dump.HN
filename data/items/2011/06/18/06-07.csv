It's just confusing and therefore unsatisfactory to use usefulness as a tool to decide how to spend your life.<p>The reason why one shouldn't be That Guy is not because spending all your life playing Poker, or doing Maths, or playing Chess (as in the case of Bobby Fischer) just for the sake of it doesn't benefit others, but because when your level of obsession reaches a certain point, the point of diminishing returns, you just get confused -- you can't tell whether you are still getting pleasure doing it anymore. You've been off-balanced with other parts of life for too long that you've lost the  ability to approach your passion purely from intellectual curiosity, as you used to.<p>So the bottom line is, solving intelligent puzzles is fun, as long as you don't abuse it.",1308380374

I certainly wouldn't mind hearing sponsored songs that Earbits can algorithmically determine I am likely to like based on my tastes and use of the service.  A well-targeted system would also make it more viable for small artists, who could target small niches of customers that had a higher probability of converting to sales of merchandise, concert tickets, etc.  This is what happened with AdWords. One might have expected AdWords to be a mechanism for large content sites with money to spend advertising to get a lot more traffic, but as it turned out AdWords was a boon for niche but profitable businesses.",1308380236

2668051,comment,2667830,2667908,5,0,tytso,,,"It used to be the case that MIT required their CS undergraduate students build an 8-bit computer from TTL (mostly 74XX) chips on breadboard in their Freshman on Sophomore year.   (And no, we didn't even get a Z80; the most complex parts we got was an ALU unit and a 8250 UART so you could communicate with the computer over an RS-232 port.)   It's really too bad that this isn't something which is required any more.<p>Instead undergraduates are taught how to write Java programs, which is one of those languages where it's impossible to worry about silly things like cache-line misses, because there are too many layers of abstraction between you and the hardware....

But this time I feel I have something to say.<p>The fundamental question behind all these arguing is, what can be considered useful?  In the other word, what we do, couldn't be considered a waste of life?<p>Philosophers have been arguing about this for 2000 thousand years. So I doubt there's going to an absolutely correct answer in near future.  What I can offer, is just my personal choice.<p>Whether we like it or not, whatever we do, whatever we've build, good or evil, will vanish sooner or later. The human beings will extinct, the earth will become quite, the sun will extinguish.  It's just matter of time.  If nothing we do could make any sense in the long term, how can we consider something useful not?<p>Like any living things on this world, we, humans, are born to have many instincts, like to survive, to reproduce, to play.  And when we don't obey these inner demands, we feel unhappy.  So we eat, drink, sleep, f<i></i><i>, and make money.  However, that's because what we do is useful, or important, or has any meaning behind them.<p>Some people might feel happier when they can attain something that are </i>useful* for others, which usually bring them more money, food, prestige, and many other things.  But some might be satisfied enough by resolving some intelligent puzzles.  As long as people don't end up in a crappy motel because they couldn't get their life in order, I guess these 2 attitudes towards life are both OK.",1308377026

I agree fully with this, imho the price difference is hardly worth the time to deal with all the various issues around install, upgrading etc.<p>I've also found the Mac mini to be completely adequate; and it still seems to me that even buying an iMac at $1k+ is still a pittance for a toolchain for this type of platform, considering one also gets a general-purpose computer to boot.",1250124976

initial idea was something like a url shortening service, but with some kudos or credits. needless to say that in the meantime urlshortening services are spreading and the need for those url shorteningservices is kind of controversial. apart of the fact that tr.im just quit their service because of a non existing business model. we can think of some other ideas for those domains, but matter of fact we don't have the time or ressouces to get onto something. so, the simple question is: what to do. if someone here on hn has a good idea, we are open for suggestions. i think the domains and the potentials behind are to cool to just sell them for cheap. but of course we are open for offers ;)",1250123763

They just need a crappy IT staff or to hire some 'lowest bidder' option to build their site that learned HTML by reading some Microsoft Press book on Frontpage.<p>There are some sites that have perfectly fine webpages that are screwed up because bureaucrat somewhere decides that the site needs to be 'updated' either because they feel that flash animations on the front page are 'the next big thing' or because they want to hire a friend/campaign contributor to do the job. Then they end up with a site that it worse off than the one they had in the first place, but they don't fix it because then they would be admitting that they wasted all the money that's already been sunk into the project.",1250122247

We help seniors use rigorous cognitive exercise to prevent or slow the development of dementia. At least, that's what our marketing people say. I say it slightly differently: ""We help seniors remember their grandchildren for a few months or years longer than they would otherwise.""<p>We started in 2005, are venture-funded, and are not yet profitable. We're raising our 2nd round of venture funding right now. All employees get stock options, and we have medical, dental, and vision coverage.<p>We're looking for people who will work out of our Santa Monica, CA office. It's a casual office environment with really good coffee, and people often bring their dogs in to work. Today there's a Neapolitan Mastiff (<a href=""http://twitpic.com/cwjfl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/cwjfl</a>) and a Chihuahua here.<p>Our touchscreen appliance (visible in the picture at the link above) runs Ubuntu Linux, and most of our infrastructure is Linux-based, with a few Windows (SQL Server) and OS X boxes. Our GUI software is written in REALbasic, and our system administration scripts are BASH and Python.<p>We're also in the process of developing a software-only installable product that will run on OS X and Windows.<p>Our desktops are OS X or Linux (your choice) with two big-ass monitors per person. We do well (but not 100%) on the Joel test, and are always looking for ways to make our work more efficient and productive.<p>Our biggest need right now is for someone in a combined Linux System Administration and QA Automation role. This would entail everything from installing and configuring Postfix to automating install testing for our Windows product.<p>We're also looking for QA Engineers for the Windows/OS X Product, and for additional support people, again, with Windows and OS X experience. Linux experience for both the QA Engineers and the support people is a huge plus.<p>To avoid getting put in the ""Craigslist"" mountain of resumes, send a cover letter and resume directly to me: schof at dakim.com",1250121854

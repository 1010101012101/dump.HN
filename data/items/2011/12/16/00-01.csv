This horse-shit-storm is <i>not</i> about the ""general angle"" of MG and Gruber but about that analogy and the point it was making.<p>And it's not just the ""nicer bounce after a scroll"", its the whole UI interaction.  The thing that iPhone fans like about their products is how the interface disappears and you don't need to think about it.  The touch interaction model makes the user think that they are directly interacting with the content itself, rather than through the intermediate of a controller, and that this content is actually physical, rather than a representation on the screen.  It's an illusion, but it is a compelling one. Examples: \n* The right bounce after a scroll, and the right inertia when you flick to scroll through a list;\n* Dragging your finger to pan around a map or large web page;\n* Icons and buttons changing their appearance instantly to show that they've been pressed.<p>It's little things that give immediate feedback to the user that create this illusion, and it doesn't take much to break it and remind you that you're using a device.  What MG and Gruber keep pointing out is that Android keeps breaking this illusion, for example with stuttery scrolling or laggy/inappropriate feedback when you push buttons.",1323996907

Third party retailers may charge more because they only otherwise make money if people sign contracts and generate commissions. I read Radio Shack and Best Buy charge $750 for the commitment free device. But if you go to a corporate Verizon shop or buy it off the web, it's $650.<p>That said: I actually found that with my corporate negotiated discount with Verizon getting me $50 off a device if you signed a contract, it is cheaper for me to add a contract line to get the subsidized price, and then immediately cancel it and pay the ETF rather than buy the phone outright.

In this piece he's at least very open that he's talking about perception and the war over ""tangible"" issues is pretty much over (in that both platforms are sufficiently good).<p>My main problem is that just as the intangibles matter on the iOS side they also matter on the Android side, but the Android ones don't seem to get any merit.

The fact that the Android ecosystem lets <i>me</i> choose the kind of device I want, how much I want to pay for it, how it should look and feel and behave.

Or why did the young Richard Wagner, to the consternation of his parents and teachers, repeatedly play truant from school just to be able to spend whole days concentrating on the orchestral scores of Beethoven's symphonies? Or Ted Williams, the famous baseball player, whose mother worried about the normality of his running all the way home from school every day to practice until nightfall relentlessly pitching baseballs through a hole in a backboard? It is the same story repeatedly in the biographies of the world's truly exceptional performers in every field.

For example,<p><pre><code>    nil\n    => NIL\n    (eql '() nil)\n    => T\n    (setf *read-base* 36)\n    nil\n    => 30477\n    (eql '() nil)\n    ERROR: 19101 is not a function name; try using a symbol instead\n    (|EQL| '() nil)\n    => NIL\n</code></pre>\nFor you non-lispers, the empty list '() is equal to the ""false"" value, nil. Also, the pipes are special syntax to allow for symbols which normally not parse as symbols.

In the interview process, Teach for America now asks applicants to talk about overcoming challenges in their livesand ranks their perseverance based on their answers. Angela Lee Duckworth, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, and her colleagues have actually quantified the value of perseverance. In a study published in TheJournal of Positive Psychology in November 2009, they evaluated 390 Teach for America instructors before and after a year of teaching. Those who initially scored high for gritdefined as perseverance and a passion for long-term goals, and measured using a short multiple-choice testwere 31 percent more likely than their less gritty peers to spur academic growth in their students. Gritty people, the theory goes, work harder and stay committed to their goals longer.

As Lt. Robert Bowman pointed out in ""Star Wars:  A Defense Expert's Case Against the Strategic Defense Initiative,"" this had a stabilizing effect because both sides could be certain they were not being attacked and therefore would not be inclined to mistakenly counter-attack.  Spying can have a similar effect in that it can provide additional reason to believe that another party is not in the process of preparing an attack.<p>The larger problem though is that geopolitics is real.  We didn't invade Iraq for the reasons we were told.  We did it for geopolitical and domestic political reasons, and every piece of data would be tortured enough that it would say what the government wanted it to say, even if no reasonable person could put all the data together and make it say what Bush wanted it to say.

The federal government has the power to ensure that no states forbid the importation of other states goods, or apply duties or tariffs to them.  You're using ""regulate"" in the modern form and applying it to language that was written when the term had a different meaning.  ""Well regulated militia"" means a militia free of encumbrances such that it can be functional, not one with a lot of extra-legislative rules applied to it. This is logical if you think about it- if they wanted the militia to be regulated, they would have laid out the ways he militia should be regulated, or at least enumerated the power <i>to</i> regulate the militia, in the enumerated powers clause.  They did not.  Further, ""regulations"" as we commonly understand them, are forbidden by the constitution, which explicitly denies the legislative branch the power to delegate its power to unelected bodies or to other branches.<p>The fist amendment states, <i>""congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech""</i>.  Blocking access to websites clearly violates that. Thus congress is explicitly in violation of the constitution, without regard to anything any court might say.  Further, US Code 18-242 makes it a crime (a felony if one is armed) to violate the constitutional rights of any citizen.  This means that passing SOPA would be, itself, a crime, at least in my interpretation.<p>The ""shouting fire in a crowded theater"" example does not refute the protections for free speech.  In that case, the crime is not speaking the word fire while inside a theater, but in causing a panic, which is quite different.<p>I'm sure the word ""Fire"" can be heard, often shouted, on broadway quite regularly, when the author of the play included it in the dialogue.<p>I suggest that you take some time and read the constitution in its entirety.  In fact, even better would be to get one of the many books that cover its writing, including citations of the intents and comments of the writers and past editions.   The constitution is quite readable and quite explicit.<p>It is also quite different from the result after ""years of jurisprudence"" and precedent, which, like I pointed out in my original post, suffer from the intrinsic corruption endemic to government.<p>As Lysander Spooner once said, ""either the constitution authorized such government as we have, or it has failed to prevent it.""   No ruling of any judge can overrule what is said in the constitution, and the constitution does not need to be interpreted very much, it is quite straight forward.<p>The reason it is this way is that the founding fathers were no fools.  They knew judges and politicians would use emotion, expidents and pressures to try and change the system for their ends.  It is a testament to their foresight that the system has lasted as long as it has, but they knew it would ultimately fail.<p>Thus they wrote a constitution that any american could read and comprehend, and they were quite clear that americans needed to take up arms against their government to ensure that the government remained restrained by the constitution:<p>""The tree of liberty must be renewed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants, it is its natural manure.""<p>To the extent that our government bears little resemblance to the one outlined by this document, our government is one that is <i>not</i> authorized by the document, and thus wholly illegitimate.  No amount of laws or court rulings can change this.<p>To the extent that this divergence has persisted, we as a people have failed to uphold the vigilance that was required of us.<p>Hierarchy simply means an arrangement between people with division of roles.  Corporations are hierarchies but they are not governments.<p>There is a key difference. Governments impose their will on those who are subjugated by force, with violence.  If you're subject to the rule of a government you don't have a choice, even when the government is violating your rights (as it would be with SOPA).<p>This is not the case with corporations, as employees, customers and owners of corporations all participate in the hierarchy on a voluntary basis.  You are free to boycott them, resign your position, or sell your shares, if you disagree with the policies of the corporation.<p>You have almost no recourse when you disagree with government.<p>People can live in peace, and they can do it without governments, and they have successfully for centuries, under  quite a variety of arrangements.  The only reason for the prevalence of government we see today is the technology of warfare gave small bands of people the power to conquer and subjugate larger populations.<p>But it is not the natural state of man, any more than other forms of slavery were a natural state when they were more prevalent.... and slavery in the form practiced in the United States in the past, and elsewhere in the world has lasted essentially as long as governments.... for exactly the same reason.",1323995061

3358745,comment,3357522,3358381,6,0,dalke,,,"The heart of the matter is, what is gender? It's clearly not the case that gender is identical to being biologically male or female, eg, based on which sex organs are present, or on the chromosome. You need only read the Wikipedia pages on ""intersex"" and ""third gender"" to see some of the diversity in the world. Sex indeterminacy is only one of many possibilities.<p>Go back to the original Turing Test. In ""The Imitation Game"", the questioner must determine which of two people is male and female based only on written notes. (Presumably typewritten or some other means which doesn't even reveal handwriting.) If the only way to tell that a person who looks like a female is actually a male is through a close physical examination, then will you at least agree that they are doing a good job of acting as a female?<p>Of course there are many people who do that, including actors and cross-dressers, who see it as a different persona which they can put on or take off. For those who work hard at it, it's a sign of respect to be called ""she"" because it's a recognition of the effort needed to get the body language, and voice patterns, and dress style down.<p>But some people feel that being born male was a mistake, a birth defect. A cleft palate is a birth defect which is easily fixed nowadays. Nose jobs and breast implants and LASIK are usually voluntary procedures to change a genetic characteristic. Gender reassignment isn't as simple, but much easier pre-puberty. One worry is that the person, decades later, may decide that the choice made as a child was wrong, or at least deluded. That's why there's a lot of counseling involved.<p>If someone considers themself a female, takes on female gender roles, and to every extent possible acts like a female, then can you see why there's some offense that some side effects of some stupid little chromosome still make others call them a ""he"" instead of ""she""?<p>That person may still be deluded. The question for you is, how do you tell the difference between a delusion and (what you consider to be the impossible case of) actually being born as the wrong sex? What are the negatives and benefits of encouraging vs. denying that delusion? Bear in mind that clearly a number of transgender people are happier having made that change.<p>As to your Superman example, ""Superman"" is a specific person from a fictional world. But suppose you thought you were Kryptonian, and you underwent hypothetical genetic tinkering and technological augmentation to get x-ray vision, super-strength, and so on. Then yes, I would call you a Kryptonian, or a human transformed into a Kryptonian if I wanted to be more precise. Just like my Dad, born Canadian, is now a US citizen. But if you just decide one day that everyone should call you ""Superman"", without making any effort at it, then don't be surprised if people don't agree with you. What would that effort look like? I saw a Superman impersonator on the Strip in Vegas, and would have no problems calling that person the Man of Steel.",1323994920

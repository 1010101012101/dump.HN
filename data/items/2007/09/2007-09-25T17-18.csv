It's a shame they're not doing something truly valuable, like getting inside-out with all that user information.<p>It's especially easy to get dark on them because of the attitude: ""We're marginally more forward-thinking than MySpace, so think of us in terms of Google.""",1190742742
59476,comment,59036,59110,0,0,karzeem,,,"The ads on Facebook get abysmal clickthrough rates (often less than 0.1%).  $10 billion is a P/E of more than 300, and even for a very hot company, that is pretty far into outer space.  If these are in fact the numbers being thrown around behind the scenes, you're probably right that it's because Microsoft wants a place to improve its ad serving (and to deny Google that same place).",1190742587

59471,comment,58025,58498,0,0,ww,,,"A degree in Philosophy = the same value as a degree in computer science.  You come out knowing about as much as someone with 2 to 12 months of real life experience depending on how much you applied yourself.  You shouldn't expect anyone who 'majored' in something to actually have applied it.<p>To get that experience I would challenge PG to go around
the internet and debate something like universalism vs
nominalism.  You would have to take the nominalism side if
you think 'math' is 'science' and not philosophy.  Remember
though, that bertrand russel was a universalist .. you know
.. that strange believe that numbers exist outside of the 
human mind and are not physical, sort of like what Plato
believed. <p>PS forget Wittgenstein.  To quote him: 'My propositions are
elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally
recognizes them as senseless'.

59463,comment,59390,59401,0,0,wschroter,,,"sanj - it's tricky to find a voice and message that resonates with a broader audience.  in my book, for example, i explained a lot of stuff like ""how to scale"" which i thought was relatively pedestrian yet was really complicated for some people to understand.  then when you take it a step further and publish it in mainstream media like forbes, you have to be careful of alienating a broader audience.  what to you is a ""flaccid truism"" (great label btw) is a wildly powerful concept to others.  i spend far more time trying to simplify concepts than trying to dig deeper into them.  from what i've seen of most on-line startup pundits, a great deal of their audience is made up for the same people and becomes somewhat nepotistic.

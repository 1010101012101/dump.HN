IIRC, the Camry in question had an electronic throttle, and the pedal part that experienced accelerated wear was an acetal bearing surface that was supposed to mimic the feel of a traditional throttle control.

Many people don&#x27;t know that it was the US, and not the UK, who mostly contributed to the spread of English -- of course one might argue that US talk English in first place due to the UK. That world-wide&#x27;fication started after the WWII. In Europe, for instance, the number of students learning English as first foreign language only surpassed French ones by the 50s and 60s in most countries (sorry, can&#x27;t point  now to the document in which I saw this info).<p>Why was it so massive? Due the huge world-wide US influence associated with the mass communication that was being established as mainstream by that time. It were the movies, the TV shows, the music. On tech it were the electronics, then computer science and then internet. Suddenly it was a snowball: the aeronautics, the navigation, the research papers, the international treaties, you name it... all in English.<p>We&#x27;ve got to a point where if a given music is in its original language, it runs the risk of being mostly unknown, but if it&#x27;s translated to English, it might be a huge success (see Claude François&#x27;s Comme d&#x27;habitude vs Frank Sinatra&#x27;s My Way, just to name one).<p>No language can ever surpass English until all this shifts to that language, and that&#x27;s very unlikely to happen.

Frauenhofer in particular is rather &quot;patent focused&quot; and I think it carries over to their (there&#x27;s a lot of Frauenhofers...overgeneralizing) general view on software. It&#x27;s only anecdotal evidence from being at some research matchmaking events (Horizon 2020 etc.) and working in that field.<p>That being said OpenSource is explicitly mentioned in many calls. I&#x27;m mostly working on country specific calls but they are usually constructed similarly. OpenSource is often mentioned as a &quot;potential use after the project&quot; or a &quot;result&quot;. Interestingly the provided headlines for calls will often read like this:
&quot;Potential use (for example OpenSource, patents, marketable product)&quot; :D<p>+Actual software development usually isn&#x27;t the goal of research projects. In the EU they use maturity levels (initially from the aviation industry I think) and it&#x27;s quite a bit more &quot;actual software/solutions&quot; focused than the country specific calls (by design).

It&#x27;s particularly embarrassing when they make a mistake early on, and then I can&#x27;t just look down at the test sheet in my hand for the correct answers to see if the rest of the numbers are correct.<p>That said, like other commenters have said, it&#x27;s supposed to be a little bit hard.

Two years ago we did a zombie musical that won awards (best film, best comedy) at multiple festivals (think &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; with a zombie). It&#x27;s good. (Yes, I am biased - but if you search, you&#x27;ll find some good reviews, and few poor ones).

I&#x27;ve seen the script, it is quite funny. We are hoping to have it done in time for those same festivals. Fingers crossed.<p>So we try an Indiegogo campaign. A couple of grand in two months.

Because there are sooooooo many campaigns, so many people making movies right now, especially shorts (sigh, a bane, we make features, which require commitments from people, who turn around and do 5, 6, 10 shorts because they can squeeze them in on a weekend without missing anything else; I do features coz IM(NS)HO it&#x27;s way cooler).<p>And these movies are heavily pirated. Pretty much everything the director has made has a distribution deal. And everything the director has made is on torrents.<p>Kickstarter and Patreon and Indiegogo have one thing in common with the big studios: Landing a paying deal, a money-making deal is as much a lottery win with the one as with the other.

I am neither justifying nor trying to justify torture. I am trying to show why nations convince themselves that torture is justifiable. The calculus of nations - their realpolitik - exists in a world where an analysis of torture makes it seem sensible (entirely tangential to its being reprehensible).<p>To add more here: what I&#x27;m saying is that if every modern nation actively participates in these behaviors we must go beyond good and evil to understand the behavior - there only appears to be relative good rather than an exaggerated excluded middle. A realist, realpolitik analysis affords us a way of understanding the points of contention and the contradictions that incentivize those nations and their representatives to participate in reprehensible activity.<p>Wherein comes &#x27;constructive realism&#x27;: if it is incentives and power conflict that incentivize reprehensible acts then we can fix the acts not by voting for new representatives but by changing the conditions that lead to contentions. The realpolitik analysis is not a cynical analysis or one that is doomed to justify behavior: it is instead one that places the responsibility on conditions and context as much as specific actors.",1430169681

According to the article, they fixed the pedal for subsequent models of the car.<p>> <i>Furthermore, it&#x27;s not a tough problem to design a pedal that moves back and forth in high humidity or high temperatures that a car interior is going to see. And it&#x27;s not expensive.</i><p>According to the article, the problem was that the material of the pedal was unexpectedly degrading in that environment, causing it to become stuck. This isn&#x27;t a matter of it being expensive to produce a better pedal, it&#x27;s simply a matter of an unforeseen interaction (which would argue that it <i>is</i> in fact hard to design a pedal that works flawlessly in that environment). And so they fixed it on subsequent models. But fixing it on all the existing cars out there would amount to an expensive recall that seemed to be rather unnecessary.<p>> <i>I imagine a stuck pedal is likely to cause confusion in a driver. It would take some time before a driver will process what is happening, and realize that the accel pedal is indeed stuck. It seems like surely it would cause accidents.</i><p>According to the article, at the time when the issue first cropped up, there were no known cases of an accident caused by the stuck accelerator (note: I don&#x27;t know if any happened later). Furthermore, the natural reaction to &quot;my car is unexpectedly accelerating&quot; is to slam on the brakes. I could easily see someone panicking, but a panicking person doesn&#x27;t forget that the brake pedal exists, especially since all drivers have been conditioned to understand that pressing the brake pedal is how you stop the car.<p>Based on this, their response seems pretty straightforward. Yes, there&#x27;s a relatively rare issue with a stuck accelerator, but (at least at the time) there&#x27;s no known cases of this leading to an accident, and the natural response by a driver upon encountering the problem, which is to hit the brakes, is sufficient to neutralize the issue. Therefore, no expensive recall is necessary.<p>That said, they obviously had a PR problem. And it was magnified by the media&#x27;s propensity to hype up situations like this, turning it into a newsworthy story (because that gets more viewers). It seems the vast majority of incidences of unexpected acceleration were not even caused by the stuck accelerator, they were either caused by poorly-fitting third-party floor mats, or by people inadvertently pressing the accelerator when they meant to press the brake, both of which are issues that are not unique to Toyota cars (in point of fact, to the best of my knowledge, every incidence of someone unable to stop the car by pressing the brake pedal was in fact pedal confusion, where they were pressing the accelerator thinking it was the brake, and therefore not caused by this defect at all).<p>Ultimately, I think Toyota had the right engineering response, they just needed to fix their PR response. Don&#x27;t let the engineers dictate communication to the customers. Understand that reality and public perception are often at odds with each other, and that public perception is just as important as reality. That&#x27;s not to say that they should have issued a recall, because they shouldn&#x27;t (if anything, that would have reinforced public perception that the cars were dangerous). But they should have realized that they needed to communicate with the public in a different fashion.",1430169140

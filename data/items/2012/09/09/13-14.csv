I suspect the argument for keeping the ""30-02-1890"" data intact would apply equally to my made-up examples. I'd design this with a ""date as enscribed"" varchar column, and an ""linterpreted date for search/sorting purposes"" date column.",1347199182

I'm originally a JavaScript developer and I didn't write a single line of python code before this project.<p>I needed a project to learn python and I choose something I'm already familiar with. Underscore.js has almost everything you want to learn on a new language and it thought me a lot.<p>When I completed the project I figured I can post it online and other clueless javascript developers like myself can learn python from a familiar place.<p>I'm fully aware that python already has most of the tools underscore has and this code is not pythonic at all. It was built that way intentionally. I wanted it to be the same as underscore.js.<p>Now I need your advice to write a better python code and maybe create a useful library after all.<p>Thank you all.<p>PS: I wrote this comment from mobile phone so please excuse any errors.",1347199070

4495776,comment,4495013,4495013,10,0,FollowSteph3,,,"A common theme I saw across the examples, AND A CAR PAYMENT. If you're in debt, then the last thing you should be acquiring is another depreciating asset that costs money. Not only do you have car payments and insurance, but you also have maintenance, and everything else that goes along with a car.<p>Also, how many of these same people have tv's with cable? Cell phones with data plans? Go out for diners, drinks with friends, and so on?<p>When I graduated I spent 3-4 years paying down my debt as quickly as possible. I believe I got my first car, and it was for under $1000, when I was in my late 20's. I just couldn't afford one.<p>I also noticed at least one example of someone also buying a home with a $100,000+ debt. That to me is just a bad financial decision. Anything happens and your in trouble.<p>Also I did notice a lot of the examples showed degrees where getting a job would be tougher, or that it wouldn't pay that well compared to the cost of the debt. I hate to say this, but not all degrees are created equal, and in today's world you need to evaluate the cost to benefit. Unfortunately for some degrees, you can only really acquire them if you have disposable income because there's no way you can make a profit.<p>In any case, the most common theme I noticed was that they couldn't afford the debt with their other expenses. But the author rarely discussed what they were. For me a car is a luxury. Tv is a luxury. Anything beyond the most basic $20/mth cell is a luxury. Going out for drinks and suppers is a luxury.

Still allows for conversion.<p>A more interesting question becomes what happens when you have to store local calendar values which are non-Gregorian, like '1712-02-30' which was a date that existed in Sweden (due to a rare Gregorian to Julian conversion).  PostgreSQL treats all dates as Gregorian and so Julian dates and weird pseudo-Julian dates (the double leap day to abort the failed conversion to the Gregorian calendar) have to be handled by conversion.<p>This is good and consistent.  If you are recording dates and you need to know what date they represented you need a consistent calendar.  If you want to convert Gregorian to Julian that can be done. but you'd have to code that no matter what db you are working with.<p>Otherwise you run into weird issues like determining the length of an interval across two calendars where you may not know that because calendars changed at different times in different countries.",1347198840

4495749,comment,4495377,4495715,4,0,einhverfr,,,"Author here.<p><i>Mysql - Model is in your code. PostgreSQL - Model is at least partially in your database.</i><p>Also your code can be at least partly in your database which is what makes this possible.<p><i>There is a HUGE mistake in the article in the assumption that WRT the model design, that the database always knows best.</i><p>I didn't say that.   However if you read the entire O/R modelling series you will see in PostgreSQL it is possible to fully define your model in an OO-like way in your database, and if you do that then that model can be re-used across applications written in different development environments.  We now have proof of concept PHP classes for integrating with LedgerSMB because of the fact that our model is in our db.  This makes it very easy to write classes which interop across different languages.<p>The fact is you can decide where you want the line to be.  PostgreSQL allows you to build interfaces which give you much more intelligent data models at every line.<p>These tools have complexity costs though.  Use where appropriate.<p><i>Is it persistent storage or is it a turing complete theorem prover and why most both be in the same executable? Note I'm not claiming a ""middleware"" of a model is a bad idea, in fact its a great idea, it just doesn't belong in the persistant DB store anymore than it belongs in the filesystem layer.</i><p>Mike Stonebraker's example was:  Create a db query to tell you what images (in your database) are pictures of sunsets taken within 20 miles of Sacramento.<p>His argument for code being in the database is that the last thing you want to do is select several thousand images and hand them over to the middleware or client for processing.  Instead you need some way of having the database answer this and only send you back the ones you want.  He suggests:<p><pre><code>    select id\n    from slides P, landmarks L S\n    where sunset (P.picture) and\n    contains (P.caption, L.name) and\n    L.location |20| S.location and\n    S.name = 'Sacramento';\n</code></pre>\nThe point here is that you have two good examples of why this approach can be important here:  spacial queries, and filtering out images by content using image recognition algorithms.  In this way, you aren't burdening your least scalable tier with transferring MB and MB of information back to a middlware so it can perform the processing and return only a few records to the client.",1347198146

Player could transliterate them if user doesn't know the alphabet (e.g. doing romanization of hiragana, katakana and kanji using Hepburn system for japanese music). Such entry should be able to store also a translated text, usually at least English one for non-English stuff.<p>That would solve also another problem the blog post author mentions, first name and last name ordering issue. Quoting Wikipedia:<p>""In Hungary, along with China, Korea, Japan and in many other East Asian countries, the family name is placed before a person's given name.""<p>Thus in original language the order would be original, but in English one, Western-style, i.e. placing last name after the first name (and of course transliterated already).<p>It would be up to a user to choose what player should show her or him: original names, transliterated names, translated names.<p>But AFAIK ID3v2 and Vorbis don't support such stuff (well, you can try going with custom keys, but non-standard means mess) and I haven't heard about player that would do any transliteration either.<p>---<p>As for filenames I think that the best is Latin alphabet, with the most-widely used romanizations of non-Latin alphabets and simplifications of extended Latin alphabets (like removing diactric marks etc.).

Its possible to come up with weird situations where you just want the DB to store stuff and not nanny you.  Consider a database of actual, real world, gravestone inscriptions.  If someone's gravestone stone has ""1890-02-30"" inscribed on it, I know thats wrong but I don't care, I need to store it exactly as is for historical purposes, I don't want a DB crash or need to recompile postgres to accept it, I don't want to force the users to falsify gravesite records, I don't want to have to store as a CHAR or VARCHAR and have to write my own date handling routines in my app... The correct way to handle data modeling/integrity is to allow the app designer to decide how flexible he wants to be WRT reality, and let him decide exactly how to shoot himself in his foot.<p>On a bigger scale, if I made a database table and related CRUD app to store philosophical positions, if I wanted an AI to only accept ""truth"" then I'd put the AI in my app, I would not want the DB model and the app model to have to fight over Marx being right or wrong before the data could be stored.  What if filesystems needed to verify ""truth"" before allowing a file to be saved?  Weird.<p>Is it persistent storage or is it a turing complete theorem prover and why most both be in the same executable?  Note I'm not claiming a ""middleware"" of a model is a bad idea, in fact its a great idea, it just doesn't belong in the persistant DB store anymore than it belongs in the filesystem layer.",1347197257

Just like atheists are cultish in response to cultish cults.<p>If reducing delta wave sleep by 10% significantly decreases performance on memory and reasoning tests, why should reducing delta sleep by 90% fail to decrease performance?<p>Lots of studies are done on sleep, but they are never as extreme as polyphasic because it would be considered unethical to perform those studies. Those few insane people like me who actually did go polyphasic don't get scientifically tested.<p>It <i>did</i> work for me but I recognized that my performance had decreased because at the time I was in memorization-oriented schooling and using Anki to manage my memorization tasks. With the help of Anki, I could see quite clearly that my memorization abilities had decreased.<p>It was also never a natural state. It was a constant state of heightened autonomic response - fight or flight. Especially at nighttime, my body was surging with corticosteroids. This stress response is what provides the capability to stay awake so long, but it comes at the price of high-level thinking and memorization.<p>Typically in nature, humans will adopt polyphasic sleep in times of war and other extremely stressful situations. This is adaptive because their life is threatened. This is not the case for the modern knowledge worker.<p>There is tons of science on sleep. The polyphasic people base their theory on the outdated and discredited idea that we only need REM sleep. This has been categorically disproven by modern sleep researchers. Slow wave sleep provides many benefits, the most clear being improved memory but also better performance on other cognitive tasks.",1259301135

And btw, the Community Reinvestment Act was introduced in 1977, I doubt it played a major influence in the GFC of 2008.
In 2000 regulation was removed for credit default swaps, Lehman, AIG, Bear-Sterns,FM & FM and others all went under due to overload of toxic credit default swaps.

Approaching professors can be intimidating, but you'll have to do it if you want to go to grad school. Might as well start now.<p>In my experience, the profs who are really good at what they do don't act arrogant and aren't dismissive of students. If anything, they get really excited talking about their research, and you'll have a hard time leaving their office :) If you do encounter someone who is arrogant, that tells you something about them (you don't want to be their grad student).

One could probably observe the same dynamics arising semi-spontaneously in any context where a group with a diffuse distribution of influence has to make a collective decision. It's the old ""design by committee"" problem, just writ very large when we're talking about the US federal government.<p><i>Very interesting. Is it a bug?

963479,comment,963220,963392,0,0,quant18,,,"The real hard part of Arabic is the morphology. It's ""irregular"", both in the human sense that there's all sorts of horrible exceptions to ridiculous numbers of rules, and in the compsci sense that you cannot recognise/produce the inflected forms of nouns and verbs using a finite state automaton/transducer. (Though, that's true for all the Afroasiatic languages including Amharic, Hebrew, and Hausa, but the FSI claims those are only ""Level II"" languages).<p>Also IMO Arabic phonology is a lot harder than either Chinese or Korean. (Chinese has tones, Korean has tensed versions of the same consonants we have in English, but Arabic has the pharyngeal and glottal consonants, completely unlike anything in English). On the other hand, Georgian's worse.<p>Finally, if you take Arabic in a school, they're going to teach you Modern Standard Arabic AKA fusha, which is basically in the same position that Latin was in 14th-century Europe: useful if you like to do nothing but read, useless if you actually want to understand what people are saying.",1259299138

That said, I would have expected Arabic to be of no greater relative difficulty than, say, Hindi, Persian, Hebrew, Mongolian, or such.<p>I mostly expected Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese to be of greatest relative difficulty, from what little I know about those languages, and would have expected Arabic (and many other languages) to be in the second category.",1259298952
963476,comment,963154,963251,0,0,bokonist,,,"Almost every single ""market failure"" in the economic literature is really an opportunity for a business plan.<p>All Arrow's paper shows is that certain naive structures for health insurance might not work out so well.  But there are plenty of other structures that might work well.  For example, here is the design for a better type of healthcare company:<p>- The company by contract defines that 80% of all premiums must be applied to reimbursement, the other 20% of revenue pays for administration, marketing, and profits.<p>- As a result, the company cannot profit by denying care.  If they deny care, that money must be spent on another patient.<p>- Since the money must be spent by contract, the company will be incentivized to spend the money in the way that maximizes the total health of the pool, so that they can attract more customers.  The incentives of the insurance company and the patients are actually aligned.<p>Unfortunately, in my state, and in most states, the above structure for a healthcare company is illegal.  Regulations prevent it.  So I hardly see healthcare as an example of ""market failure"" when regulations prevent the types of business plans that would actually work.",1259298936

963471,comment,962732,963170,0,0,nzmsv,,,"There's a lot more to building a university spin-off company and a successful product than just completing the original research. The research grant is like seed funding in this case. The university benefits from its involvement, which means its students benefit. Not to mention that the possibility of starting a spin-off company is a motivator to do great research. Do you really want to take all this away?<p>Sure, a lot of research ends up just sitting there, unused. Some of this is because of licensing, but not always. Most research results are quite experimental, and just can't be used in their raw form to make a product. They are useful for further research though. And no one is disallowing researchers to study and cite previous work.<p>I'm not saying the system is perfect. But it might be better to proceed with small changes, rather than trying to revolutionize research overnight.",1259298282

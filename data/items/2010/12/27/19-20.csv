I say this as a sole user of desktop Linux for nearly ten years (currently typing in CrunchBang, a Debian respin).<p>Why? The places where Linux has slowly started to spin are independent ecosystems each spun from Linux. This has slowly been becoming the case in the mobile sphere. But the mobile OSs that are winning are not the ones that are much codeshared with desktop Linux like Maemo, but those that exist in independent ecosystems like webOS and Android, not to mention the open source devices like Kindles and Tom Toms that you never think about the OS on.<p>Even the main Linux distros for desktops and similar x86 devices are beginning to separate. Ubuntu is looking at alternatives to the X server. Chrome OS has the possibility to make inroads which is not a traditional distro in any sense. Linux as a kernel is becoming something diverse that can be respun to many different uses.<p>Used to, the Linux landscape was fairly consistent.

Personally, as a liberal (who, combined with my wife, is in the ""rich"" tax bracket), I too see taxes as a necessary evil as well but I also see it as a way provide additional support to those in need with respect to social programs.  I don't see it as a way to ""level the playing field"" as claimed, but thats just <i>my</i> motivation as a counterpoint . A Keynesian liberal (and I probably fall in this camp) sees higher taxes as both a way to fund social programs and fuel the economy so good for the community <i>and</i> good for the pocketbook.<p>There's a whole other world of hurt when you look at that ""at least in theory"" part. Recent history has shown conservatives being very good at lowering taxes but totally inept at the corresponding reduction in spending. Liberals tend to be better at staying true to their higher taxes, higher spending line.<p>I'm a liberal but I can understand the basic conservative, libertarian economic argument (I have issues with libertarian theory but thats another flamewar) and can even see it as, perhaps, a viable model.

Instead I propose a kind of resource-based tax systems: Instead of taxing income tax the amount of scarce resources used. For example, the amount of land owned, the amount of oil used, or even the amount of CO2 emitted.<p>I think that such a system would have several nice implications:<p>* Businesses would automatically look for ways to save taxes, and thereby help the environment.<p>* It better reflects the true cost of a business or person to the society: If someone earns a lot of money this does not reduce my standard of living. However, if someone destroys the environment it does.<p>* As a country you can avoid loosing many of the Internet businesses to tax havens, as there is a lesser advantage of moving away.<p>Unfortunately, in many countries it's exactly the other way around. For example, many South American countries endorse usage of scarce resources by subsidize oil. While this works in the short-term, the consequences in the long-term will be fatal.",1293476596

Honest and accurate evalution of performance is the signal, stupidity and bias is the noise.  Somehow, though it's pretty frickin' amazing when you think about it, people who are chosen, guided, and evaluated by biased, flawed, mostly stupid human beings manage to treat disease, build bridges, publish newspapers, maintain sewage systems, and do everything else required to keep society going.<p>I mean, I work in a vast and faceless corporate bureaucracy driven by the most idiotic politics imaginable, but when I think back to my favorite teachers from high school, they got a raw deal compared to me.  Even though I got laid off my first job because of the dot-com bust.  Even though I left my last job because of an abusive boss.  Even though my review process is cookie-cutter and somewhat divorced from reality.  It would have been better than having no opportunity to differentiate themselves from the stupid, lazy, coasting teachers who climbed right up the pay scale with them.  Heroic, good, average, bad, and sleepwalking, they all have the same job title and same pay all the way to retirement -- it's no wonder teaching isn't respected as a profession.",1233622457

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet not for some raging group of evangelists pushing the ""right"" way to do something. The movement that utilizes this tool is about implementing standards, following rules, and building a more semantic web. DIV is <i>not</i> semantic. Regardless of if you are a designer or developer, first understand XHTML/HTML... certainly before you write about it.<p>Beyond that, why let the big guys be your standard. iGoogle is no modern marvel of web design or development. 
I'm guessing the same guy who built the backend of Google finance was tasked with the front; logically he/she would approach that in the fastest way they know. Also note that tables are intended for data. What's finance? Data. They'd better be using tables... just not for layout.",1233622167

From that point to now it's a matter of perfectioning every single aspect of their creature, to ensure a great UX (therfore fidelization).<p>What makes a great UX? A clean UI, a fast service and possibly no hiccups (to make it very short). The UI has changed <i>a lot</i> from 98 to now (check out web.archive.org) and so did their HTML code. A <i>single line</i> HTML page is obviously a conscious decision and so is the inline CSS.<p>I don't know you, so I have no idea on your experience in this field, but when you get to deal with I'm not saying huge, but decent amount of users you simply <i>have</i> to deal with scalability under every single aspect. If you don't, chances are you end up delivering a crappy service OR you spend WAY more money (bandwidth, cpu power, etc) than you actually need to.<p>EDIT: google is obviously more than html and css, and if you really want to have an idea on how they are paranoid with performances you should check out their google app engine documentation.",1233621799

I checked out Outbrain.com but it doesn't appear that you have any sort of submission form. I'm assuming you just index whatever sites you choose.  I don't see any sort of opt-out form on your site either.<p>2.  I understand that your model is based on getting recommendations from your users, and that you get those recommendations by framing people's sites so you can make the rating interface impossible to ignore.  That's a decision on your end, not my problem as a content creator. You do not promote the brand you say, but you do promote your service and its ends.<p>3.  As your model is based on a practice I find distasteful, I'm not sure why I'd want to install your widget.<p>4.  What is your business model?  Will you eventually sell advertising on the frames across the top of these sites once your widget is getting enough use?<p>5.  Can you really not find a better way to engage users other than framing other people's content?  Your reasoning here seems to boil down to ""We can't think of a better way to do this.""<p>I appreciate you coming in here and look forward to your responses.  I don't see how a business based on framing other people's content is defensible though but I'm sure there's enough framers out there ready to prove me wrong.",1233621645

Inside software engineering, you don't get promoted from Junior Software Developer to Architect by seniority.  Heck, being a senior citizen doesn't even guarantee you a promotion to Senior Software Engineer.  Outside of software engineering, only about 5% of people earning engineering degrees end up doing design work at all, so the work roles of different engineers can be very different.<p>You have a good point about retention in the early years, which is why I mentioned five years of experience.  I also believe that the best teachers just keep getting better.  However, among average teachers I couldn't tell much difference between the thirty-year-olds and the sixty-year-olds, except that the thirty-year-olds were better-looking and told better jokes.  I had dozens of teachers and cared deeply about the performance of each one (me:  valedictorian, mathlete, AP whore) so I expect I would have noticed the pattern if older teachers tended to be significantly better than younger ones.",1233621366

The recommendations we make in the outbrain widget are based on how readers rate blog posts. Therefore it is important to give readers the rating functionality (which is why we keep the frame). We don't promote our brand in the frame and did our best to keep the functionality and UI to the absolute minimum. 
Furthermore - when a reader clicks on a link to a page where our widget is installed, we don't show the frame at all as the rating functionality is already available on the page. So a good way to prevent the outbrain frame from showing up would be to install our widget on your site... ;-)

As for my marriage, we own our own properties, cars, share portfolios, other investments, and maintain separate bank accounts. We throw a set amount into a kitty each month for living expenses, but everything else is by negotiation.<p>Why? Probably because the average age for a bride is now 29 and a groom 31. At this point you've spent a decade in the workforce and have achieved a certain degree of independence. This kind of arrangement reflects that. For us there was never any question.",1233620015

In that case, you can't really hide 'behind' something because there isn't necessarily a single source to hide from. Even if only nearby solar radiation was a problem, if you ended up in a binary star system, you would have two sources to 'hide' from.<p>> <i>IMO though, if you've built a black hole, you might as well be moving something big, as in either a planet, small moon, or giant colony.</i><p>I thought that the LHC was supposed to create miniature black holes.

971435,comment,969068,970759,0,0,viraptor,,,"> 99 Out of a 100 times, you aren't implementing a rigorous spec.<p>I'd argue that most programmers do, or are supposed to. Either because they are not the designers of the system they build and what they are expected to do is to ""fill in the blanks and make it work"", or because they implement something that operates with another system and should strictly adhere to the interface/protocol.<p>The ones who have anything to say about the design are usually the system designers (duh), small project contributors (because there is no spec) and UI people (because they're designers). So yes - if your spec is ""1. make it work on this input; 2. make it fast"", then making it work in O(1) for this and only this input is basically the best thing you can do (unless you can make it faster for every input in less time of course). Spending time on generalising it is based on second-guessing the intent.<p>I'd even go as far as saying that specs have absolutely no intent. You have an intent and describe it while writing the spec and you'd better formalise your intent precisely or you will end up with something you didn't request. If you want something on every input, you'd better write it down (when you give a task to someone else).",1259725050

""First Click Free"" is actually more of an indexing policy than anything else.<p>Since its an obscure topic, and the BBC article is fairly misleading, here's a little background on what ""First Click Free"" is all about:<p>Basically, showing a different page to Googlebot than you show to users (i.e., ""cloaking"") will get your site delisted. This puts sites like NYTimes.com in a weird spot. They want to force users to register before viewing any articles, but they also want Google to index these same articles (and a forced registration would prevent that). Google wants the same thing (to index the pages), but seeks to avoid special exceptions in its algorithm (e.g., maintaining a whitelist of sites who are allowed to cloak).<p>In an effort to resolve this problem, ""first click free"" (FCF) was born.<p>In essence, FCF means that you show the user the first article without requiring registration, but once they click through to a second article, you can force them to register without running afoul of Google's no-cloaking policy. AFAIK, its not a program you have to opt-into with Google, you just implement it on your site however you like.<p>The problem is that every click that originates from news.google.com is counted as a ""first click"", even though it could be the 15th article they've viewed on nytimes.com. So clicking through from Google News becomes a hack to avoid registering for nytimes.com (or wsj.com, etc).<p>So basically, it looks like Google is relaxing the rules a bit, and saying you can ask for registration even if the click comes directly from Google News, provided the user has already viewed >= 4 articles on your site.<p>tl;dr: this a fairly minor policy shift, as I read it.",1259723749
971413,comment,970170,971266,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"""Fluorescents and Compact fluorescents produce horrible light as a result of the phosphor coating used to create white light."" That's a bit of an overgeneralisation -- there's a significant difference between the cheapo tubes and, say, an OTT tube (just one, albeit excellent, example of a full-spectrum fluorescent).<p>The easiest, cheapest way to get a decent idea of the spectrum is to use a CD or DVD (we've all got at least one coaster at home that used to be a disk). The data side makes a great diffraction spectrometer. A common industrial-grade tube has great gaping holes in the spectrum; an OTT is indistinguishable from indirect skylight (the 6500K ""north light"" of the studio artist's dream). It's a bit disconcerting at first, probably because we're very much used to incandescent light indoors (""daylight"" photographic incandescents might hit 4200K when they're brand new, and they're WAY blue compared to standard bulbs at around 2500-2800K) but it can hardly be described as ""horrible"".<p>LEDs aren't quite there yet -- at least none of the ones I've actually seen are. On the other hand, I fondly remember a time when LEDs could not be seen at all outdoors in daylight and drank power at a rate that would have left a plasma TV in an envious rage -- one had to duck into the shade and press eighteen or so buttons simultaneously in order to tell time on a thousand-dollar digital watch.

Would my chances of landing someone good change?(The site is already profitable, although the profit would be eaten up by a programmers salary)<p>Finally, are there people I could hire to help me figure out the technical requirements I will have and to help me hire someone appropriate, since I am in no position to judge anyone's technical abilities?<p>Thanks a bunch",1259723147

Virtual currency has been very successful for games, but LinkedIn doesn't have any games.<p>If their developer program is successful and 3rd party app developers utilize virtual currency then it would make more sense (like what Facebook is planning with credits)",1259723089

There was none, and ""rolling it out"" on HN is merely asking for feedback, not trying to sign up paid users.<p>In the email exchange I've had with Craig, not all of which I've posted, I've asked him to clarify on this point:<p>""Oh, and about being noncommercial. A bunch of the RSS mashup sites I've seen, like Craiglook, throw up advertising presumably to cover server costs or make a few bucks. If I didn't want to go that route, would asking for donations be acceptable ?""<p>In his response, he said he can ask. I said please do, and that was the end of it. So for CL to break things when there is absolutely no sign of commercial purpose is a little unnecessary in my eyes.",1259722963
971400,comment,970934,970934,0,0,skolor,,,"You know, I was playing with a couple scripts (mainly Markov chain implementation), that used Craigslist as a source for data. I got a good ways into it, and got a working model (I could generate text based on the handful of inputs I had set up for it). It wasn't until that point (I know, stupid) that I went back through all the ToS and realized I really couldn't do that.<p>Now, I know I might be able to get some where with them if I tried emailing them, and asked for the data I wanted. Then again, it sounds like I probably wouldn't. Either way, while the data was surprising well suited for what I wanted to do, it isn't <i>really</i> available, at least not in any way I could actually use it.<p>It makes me kind of sad every time I see someone do something like this. You've created something super cool, something with tons and tons of data. For what I was using it for (localized text samples), I can't think of a better, more complete place to find data from. But when you see something cool, something you never thought of/never thought was important enough to implement, and go out of your way to squash it, it makes the part of me that loves data feel bad about it. Craiglist has, at any given time, literally gigs of written text with all sorts of metadata on it. In the short bit I processed, I took all of the data from just a handful of boards, and ended up with over 150mb of data. Considering that most of that was <2 weeks old, They likely process up to a terabyte of data every year, with fairly good metadata on it. Seeing all of that only being used at face value seems like such a waste.<p>(As a side note, anyone with a bunch of written text samples, with information as to where each of them was written, I would really like to talk to you. Actually, that goes for anyone with any sizeable amount of data. Just because you don't see a use for it doesn't meant that there isn't someone out there who would absolutely love to get their hands on it.)",1259722961

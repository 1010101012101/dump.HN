That gives you  a reasonably agreeable scale of measurement (not a universal scale, but the one that the team accepts). As time progresses, you see how many such tasks are completed by any person in a given time frame.<p>Not that this is foolproof, or that it works right from the beginning of a project, but over a period of time, you tend to get a good sense of how productive each member is.<p>[Edit: Typo fixed]",1277380718

The ""Ew"" means, ""it didn't do what the standard spec says it was supposed to,"" NOT ""I don't like serif fonts"".<p>Whether or not ePub lets a book designer choose a font is not up to Apple. ePub is a published standard that Apple pretends to support. The point of the article is that Apple lets book designers choose fonts for many elements in a book, but not all. This is completely non-standard and will lead to hacks.<p>Whether you would like Apple to choose 6 fonts for you to choose from, or book designers to offer different choices is completely beside the point. Or at the very least, a very different point.",1277380464

This could be a blog, informational site, simple ecommerce or even a collection of a number of each of the above to combine for the amount that you are looking at.  Of course, you are likely going to have a smaller upside with a blog than you would with a web app.  In other words, TechCrunch (a blog running on Wordpress) is a successful tech news site but it doesn't have the same potential as Facebook.<p>I don't see why there would have to be a high failure rate for web apps which might bring in 1 - 2K per month.  That's a business and as long as it's paying for it's cost and your time then there would be no reason for it to fail other than flagging interest of the owner.  That range for two developers with no other income would be a problem, but for someone who spends a few hours a week on the app and has a day job, then it might be a nice income boost.",1277380141

As such, the growth should look approximately like a logistic curve.<p>In general it takes at least 5 years to reach the saturation point on the logistic growth curve; google reached that point a few years ago, and facebook is reaching it now.  Prior to that point, you're still growing approximately exponentially.<p>Which is all a long-winded way of saying: If it takes you 5 years to reach $1k/month in profits, you might end up staying there; but if you can reach $1k/month in 2 years, you're probably going to end up a lot bigger than that.",1277379571

There is a concept called “statistical confidence” that determines whether your test results are significant (that is, whether you should take the results seriously). It prevents you from reading too much into the results if you have only a few conversions or visitors for each variation.

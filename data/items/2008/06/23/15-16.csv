225222,comment,224739,225128,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm not sure how you ever get around making a personal decision whether some idea is worthwhile or not. Simply because a person had one startup, does that make them a startup expert? Probably not. If I publish a book on model trains, does that mean my opinion on world trade is somehow worthy of five minutes of your attention?<p>In fact, most of what people say -- even famous people -- is probably off-the-cuff and not exactly geared to your particular situation. Most all communication, in fact, is basically just chit-chat: obscure facts, disagreements based on partisanship instead of philosophy, pot shots at those out of power, praise for those in power, etc.<p>You can decide to listen to what ""smart people"" have to say, and that's probably a good idea. I'd just be really careful how I defined ""smart people"" -- it certainly isn't fame. In fact, I'd turn the equation around backward: I would judge the people to listen to based on their ability to have given me insight in the past, not their fame, fortune, or other crowd-based attribute.",1214236654

What I work on, OfficeZilla.com helps organize people accross hundreds of non-profit organizations.<p>For example Mercy Ships uses OfficeZilla to upload pictures, video, and documents created out at Sea and the communications department uses that information to raise awareness of what they are doing and raise funds to do more.<p>Organizing people is much more power then say creating a database of resources.  Organizing people creates capacity to act.<p>I have a child starting 6th grade.  Before she starts school they are having a class on how she can get more out of school by being more organized.  Using time, etc.  This way she gets the most out of her own resources.  Non-profits are the same way.

In fact, by her admission it was the safety school of many who applied to Ivy League schools but were denied entry in the end.  The students essentially had all the (sometimes subconscious) elitism of the Ivy Leaguers, combined with a massive chip on their shoulders due to their supposition that they were Ivy League material that mistakenly ended up at Brandeis.  It was fascinating to read this article since she (and many of her colleagues) have many of the exact traits he describes, especially that ""I have arrived"" mentality.<p>Great submission!",1214236104

You have to set aside some time once in a while and do focused practice in order to get better at something.</i><p>An odd example, since I'm pretty sure we've all got a lot better at typing without really trying.<p>I just did a test to find out, and it turns out that in the last fifteen years that I've spent <i>not</i> learning to type, I've gone from about 35 wpm to 81. Fifteen years ago, 81 wpm would have been a pretty impressive typing speed, but nowadays I guess it's pretty normal, since the whole world has got better at typing. It doesn't seem so long ago that people were still putting their typing speed on their resumes, but nowadays high-speed typing is taken for granted -- it's gone from being a skill to being a reflex, for most people.<p>I'm not sure about programming, though. I'm sure it's possible to get better without really trying, but really trying will get you there faster. I guess the real difference is that typing is an ""easy"" skill where you can reach the maximum reasonable level of competence quite easily (who really needs more than 60 wpm?), whereas programming is a ""hard"" skill where there's far more to learn than you can possibly fit into one lifetime.",1214235842

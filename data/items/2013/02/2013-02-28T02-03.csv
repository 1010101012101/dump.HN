They may be better than the previous technology was, but they are far from perfect, and considering that they are used outside of an actual war (targeted strikes in mostly civilian areas) there is definitely the deliberate tradeoff being made to commit some very horrible atrocities in the hope that the actual (though still extralegal) target is the one who gets killed.<p>And, when you consider the horrible regimes we support and fund (yet also turn on when their atrocities are exposed) it becomes clear that the US Government is the largest sponsor of human suffering in the world.<p>This is too bad, and it's escalated under Obama.

5296563,comment,5295223,5295737,3,0,tjmc,,,"Not hard to imagine but very hard to do. There are several huge challenges:<p>- Power. Contact lenses are too small to hold batteries that will last for a reasonable period of time. You could possibly use inductive coils in conjunction with regular eyewear but that means a fair electromagnetic field aimed right at your eyes and some obvious health risks.<p>- Optics. This is actually 2 issues - First, you can't focus on anything that's literally right on your eye so you'd need to do something very clever here. Possibly direct laser projection from the lens to the retina. Second, all the electronics in the lens will be opaque and could occlude your regular vision. Let's suppose you can move most of it to the outside of the lens (as with coloured contacts now), the HUD part is still going to cover part of your pupil. So it needs to be really tiny and still produce a clear image. Not impossible maybe but very hard.<p>- Health. Less of a showstopper, but contact lenses need to breathe. Impeding the flow of oxygen to the surface of the eye can lead to corneal neovascularization - the growth of blood vessels over the cornea. So ideally these contact lenses need to be gas permeable as well.",1362018207

For simple examples, closures can present an easy alternative implementation.<p>But here's an example where you need to do a lot of extra work with a closure.  It reads a file with '#' style comments, separates comment from non-comment strings, and keeps track of a few counters which a caller in the same file can access as global variables (technically ""module-level"" variables in Python).<p><pre><code>    comments = 0
    uncommented_lines = 0
    commented_lines = 0

    def tokenize_comments(src):
        # Point A
        for line in src:
            p = line.find('#')
            if p < 0:
                yield line
                #Point B
                uncommented_lines += 1

Try to write a functionally identical implementation of this code with closures that preserves the behavior of the counters.<p>The API could be much improved, for example, we might want to wrap this in a class to get rid of those global variables.  But that's not the point.  The point is that rewriting functionally equivalent code will require you to keep track of whether the code is at Point A, B, C, or D.<p>I purposely included the counters in this example to make it impossible to unify different control paths, which would make a closure-based implementation a lot easier.  For example, if it wasn't for the counters, points B, D, and E would be identical.",1362018202

As for powdery feed, it has two major feeding methods. One is dry feeding, in this method, if the powder is fine, it will affect the food intake of pigs to some extent; on the contrary, if the powder is coarse, the utilization rate of the feed may be influenced. The other is wet feeding, that is mixing the feed with water together which is not suitable for scientific feeding due to the reduction of food intake. Compared to powdery feed, pellet feed has incomparable superiorities for pigs breeding. So more and more raisers are inclined to select feed pellets.",1362018183

Could you advise if there's any limit on number of posts that can be submitted daily? Sometimes I submit 10-15 posts a day (mostly news), so curious if I can be banned for overposting.",1362016911

Even if there is visibility, the carriers need to actively sell the phone in the store. The nokia windows device is a great example of carriers taking the marketing money and not 'selling' the phone because their sales rep would rather push an Android or iPhone to you instead.<p>Conversely, compare that to Bada (Samsung device) which sold 20M units last year, good carrier relations go a long way.<p>In this respect, I don't thinik carriers care all that much about Firefox OS, sure they will support them, but they are more likely to support Tizen with their marketing dollars because -
a) Previous good press from the Nokia N9 which Tizen was borne out of
b) Samsung are a excellent counterweight to Apple and can supply the marketing dollars to back it
c) Intel iare helping to push Tizen
d) No major conflicts of interest with carriers (e.g. Microsoft own skype which is a conflict, Apple directly updates software.. something carriers don't like)",1362016819

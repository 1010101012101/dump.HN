The question is could it be possible to capture the state of a system at a single instant and without altering the system?",1417265845

There&#x27;s plenty of Java work out there, and modern Java is a better than average language to work with.<p>Given that you&#x27;ve done some functional programming, you might also want to investigate Scala. There&#x27;s probably not too much Scala work out there right now, but you might be able to evangelize it for some appropriate workloads once you&#x27;re doing Java development.

This is a key skill that is overlooked in technical hiring and by many development blogs trying to qualify what makes a &quot;good&quot; programmer. Problem abstraction is a huge part of software development. I work in enterprise development around a very specific niche of oil and gas. (ETRM) the &quot;programming&quot; I do amounts to little more than reading and writing to a database. The tricky part is modeling a business process and breaking it down into manageable units of work. For what I (and probably most developers) do, language is just syntax to know and interchangeable.<p>In my experience, programming is a series of learning curves and plateaus. A lot of what I know just comes from experience. The best way to learn is to program. You will eventually see patterns in the types of problems you see and know the general approach to solving it even if you don&#x27;t have the exact answer.",1417264853

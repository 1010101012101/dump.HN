I actually don't mind giving advice to people, but the 4:30 AM wakeup call was unanticipated.<p>Private registration does not mean ""the registrar owns your domain"".  It is quiiiiite the racket for GoDaddy et al, but the overwhelming majority of large-scale domain buyers I'm acquainted with avail themselves of it.<p>Hosting: Orthogonal to who you register the domain with.  All registrars will let you change the DNS settings for the domain to point to your DNS server of choice.  For example, GoDaddy has all my domains pointed at ns1.slicehost.net, etc.  From there I configure what machine the domain resolves to by changing DNS records at Slicehost.<p>Note that changing DNS records is essentially at will but it is not instantaneous.  If you do it to a production website you have to take some care to avoid service interruptions.<p>Edited to add: You exhibited some interest in parking.  I would not get your hopes up -- the domains which are available for registration these days generally do not generate the level of type-in traffic to make appreciable amounts of income.  The folks who make money through parking do it because they control super-premium domain names or portfolios with 100k+ domains in them.  Given your current level of understanding of the field, you're not nearly ready to make money merely by possessing domains, so you can get away with not worrying about this factor at all.  (Instead, I would suggest putting up a mini-site on the domain and then putting at least one decent link to that site ASAP to start it aging like a fine cheese.  This is mostly for SEO reasons.)",1259329969

In general redis as of now is mostly geared towards a ""scale-up"" approach whereas cloud deployments naturally need to ""scale-out"" instead.<p><i>Application level partitioning is a good option I think. It's easy to manage, for instance you take your users in an instance, their blog posts in another, and comments in another one. Are you little and low traffic in the start and can't buy three hosts? Just use three Redis instances in the same box, and move them in different hosts as you grow.</i><p>Yes, and that's exactly the can of worms you don't want to get into.<p>What happens when one of your comment/user/post instances outgrows its host?  You have to split it further. Either logically again (users A-L on host1, M-Z on host2) or anonymously (even users on host1, odd users on host2).<p>Since nobody wants to constantly think about their data-layout the latter variant is definitely preferable.<p>MongoDB has a leg up here by providing a beta of anonymous, maintenance-free sharding already.<p><i>This will only work well if data access pattern is biased btw. And the virtual memory will not remove completely the dataset size limitation. For instance if you have 2 GB of RAM it will make sense to setup VM to have up to 32 GB of data for instance, given a biased enough access pattern, but it's not like it will work well with 1 TB of data.</i><p>That sounds bad. Very bad. Not for the people who are happy with redis today, but for those who are not touching it because of that constraint.<p><i>There are solutions to distribute among different servers that are not hard to implement and maintain.</i><p>Okay, I'll bite. Where is the turnkey solution that distributes my data over n redis-instances with automatic failover, automatic rebalancing after adding/removing an instance, n-copies for redundancy, <i>reliable</i> failure modes when an instance outgrows the available memory?<p>I would say without at least some of these features a redis-cluster could become a nightmare to maintain in the long run.",1259329353

The problem is less about the height of the ceiling but about the fact that a ceiling exists - and that redis effectively stops working when it's reached. I agree that there are applications where redis is a perfect fit, but for many others this limit is a serious problem. Also note that many projects, especially those just starting out, simply can't afford to start with 64G servers. 4-8G is a more realistic scale to assume and that will fill up faster than anyone likes.</i><p>Yes I understand this concerns, and this is why I'm trying to address this with virtual memory and redis-cluster (a proxy that takes care of handling fault tolerant consistent hashing). But my point is that there is also a cultural barrier about this issues. with 8 GB of RAM, especially if you are starting up and if you take care of selecting a data layout that is cheap, there is a lot of data you can put in memory. Another interesting alternative is to put only ""hot"" data (metadata) on Redis, and use another on-disk DB for the rest.<p><i>FWIW, the EC2 high-memory instance (64G) you cite in your FAQ goes for a swift $1728 USD/month</i>.<p>High performance DBs and EC2 IMHO are not a great fit. Not only RAM is expensive, but memory bandwidth is not optimal.<p>EC2 is just expansive from every angle you see it, it's not a problem just with Redis, but also with MySQL performances as memory is crucial to make MySQL working well.<p><i>Sharding is always worthwhile for scaling but it's a fairly delicate subject (esp. the rebalancing after add/remove of a shard and queries spanning multiple shards) and I haven't seen a shrinkwrapped solution for redis, yet.</i><p>Application level partitioning is a good option I think. It's easy to manage, for instance you take your users in an instance, their blog posts in another, and comments in another one. Are you little and low traffic in the start and can't buy three hosts? Just use three Redis instances in the same box, and move them in different hosts as you grow.<p><i>So, while an option, most people will probably rather use a competing product (e.g. MongoDB) before opening that can of worms.</i><p>MongoDB and Redis are very different products. If MongoDB is a good fit for your application, use it, it's great. But if you need Redis, MongoDB is not a drop in replacement in any way IMHO.<p><i>Yup, that would be me. Once the RAM-limitation is gone redis will suddenly become very interesting to me.</i><p>This will only work well if data access pattern is biased btw. And the virtual memory will not remove completely the dataset size limitation. For instance if you have 2 GB of RAM it will make sense to setup VM to have up to 32 GB of data for instance, given a biased enough access pattern, but it's not like it will work well with 1 TB of data.<p>So I in short I think: most in-memory barrier is cultural. There are solutions to distribute among different servers that are not hard to implement and maintain. In every kind of DB the memory should be proportional to the dataset for it to scale, and with some kind of evenly distributed data access pattern you need to take everything in memory anyway.<p>Also the fact that in Redis writes are as cheap as reads is not something to forgot. There are many applications where it will be much more viable to have more RAM that scaling concerns with writes.<p>Redis is not for everything, but I think there is a domain of applications where it is a very good fit.",1259326980

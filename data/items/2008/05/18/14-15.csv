Pron is often credited as the force that built the home video industry, for example. (Although I admit I've never seen actual data.) And I suspect that pron been a huge driver of broadband, er, penetration.<p>Anyway, we ""agree"" to this because (a) it's not as if we can stop it by protesting; and (b) it's a <i>hilarious</i> promotional idea -- probably more for the pron company than for IPv6, but maybe for both. It's right up there with Diskette Day at the Carnegie-Mellon/CWRU football game in 1986. [1] I agree, though, that it's not especially likely to improve IPv6 deployment. IPv6 has been the technology of the future for a decade, and it may remain so for a while yet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://honesthypocrite.blogspot.com/2005/10/hail-carnegie-and-kiltie-band.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://honesthypocrite.blogspot.com/2005/10/hail-carnegie-an...</a>",1211122566

If the entire project has turned out to be ""a con"" and jack shit has ended up being done for children, you have to admit that in that case they've at least pulled the most successful bluff in the computer industry, perhaps ever.<p>And I still think that some of the ideas in the Sugar interface - like the Journal, and the pervasive collaboration - are potentially revolutionary.

Because the whole thing was open source, folks are now free to part the project out: borrow the bits that seemed to work well, redesign other bits, and throw out the rest. That's the best you can expect from most academic research projects.<p>I'm not surprised to see that OLPC didn't last that long, and that the endpoint is a big explosion. That's the problem with these semi-academic semi-charitable semi-engineering semi-commercial projects: It's hard to have a child with four parents. There's a tendency for the whole thing to devolve into a tooth-and-nails custody fight.",1211121063

193358,comment,193197,193197,0,0,bigtoga,,,"Pen and paper first is my approach. I like to do workflows and ideas on pen & paper with lots of bullet points and rewrites. I go off to a secluded, quiet area and turn off the cell phone/computer and then I just start writing in long hand what my idea(s) is. After that, I start thinking about what features to add in - I'm not really being discriminate yet; any idea will do - and write those down.<p>Once I've done the initial brain dump, it's time to tighten it up (and more coffee, please). I re-write it all trying to make it shorter and more explainable to someone else. This inevitably leads me to other ideas and again I just brain dump - no worrying about shortening it or explaining it at this stage.<p>Okay - take three is tightening it up further and segregating into bucket ""A"" (must implement in beta), ""B"" (must be present in version 1.0), and then I put the rest for later. I write up the summary in 3-4 sentences max.<p>Done with that part of the planning stage - now it's time for workflows. I figure out the major consumers - who's going to use the product? I then create a page for each of them that describes, in minor detail, their usage of the product.<p>Once I have that done, I then re-write it all and tighten it up which inevitably leads to more ideas... And then I tighten it up once more.<p>Once I'm done with the paper part (usually several days), now it's time to prepare a mockup of the product's main features using a graphics editor. Once I have designed these, then it's time to start building.<p>When I build, I like to build the prototype first in terms of look/feel and then add the guts later. I'm very concerned with code maintenance here (assuming you are programming) as I know that I will rewrite this 10x in the next month and 3x in the next year. Take your time - you can make mistakes here that will be felt for years.<p>Good luck!",1211120525

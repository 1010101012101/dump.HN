4035730,comment,4033866,4033866,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"I've been reading about the use of Singaporean math curricula in the US, there are a few articles out there about the differences between the US and Singaporean style of math education. The US has been embroiled in the ""math wars"" since the '90s, over constructivist textbooks that have proven woefully ineffective in raising objective test scores.<p>Have a read:<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/miracle-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/miracle-math/</a><p>-----
It was another body blow to education. In December of 2004, media outlets across the country were abuzz with news of the just-released results of the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) tests. Once again despite highly publicized efforts to reform American math education (some might say because of the reform efforts) over the past two decades, the United States did little better than average (see Figure 1). ... And in three consecutive TIMSS test rounds (in 1995, 1999, and 2003), 4th- and 8th-grade students in the former British trading colony of Singapore beat all contenders, including math powerhouses Japan and Taiwan. United States 8th graders did not even make the top ten in the 2003 round; they ranked 16th. Worse, scores for American students were, as one Department of Education study put it, among the lowest of all industrialized countries. 
-----<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://personal.anderson.ucla.edu/jason.frand/math_enrichment/SingaporeMath.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://personal.anderson.ucla.edu/jason.frand/math_enrichmen...</a><p>It sounds like the way math is taught in many public US classrooms is killing students' confidence and interest in math. There were a few news articles talking about how many students became interested in math again after the Singapore program was introduced in their school (see here: <a href=""http://singaporemathsource.com/curriculum/schools-in-the-news/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singaporemathsource.com/curriculum/schools-in-the-new...</a> ). A common refrain was that the kids simply weren't understanding what was going on in math - as if they were stumbling around in the dark with no idea what the computations they were doing <i>meant</i>.<p>I've also read good things about other foreign curricula (e.g. ""Russian math"") being used in American schools and by homeschoolers, but none are as common as Singapore Math. Here's some praise about SM from American mothers, including sample word problems: <a href=""http://www.redshift.com/~bonajo/singapore.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redshift.com/~bonajo/singapore.htm</a> - where you'll see simple algebra problems that are not solved by traditional algebra at all.<p>I can tell you as a Singaporean that I think the curriculum gave me a solid base and understanding of school math, and really stretched me at its harder portions. I hope more people will give it a try, especially if you have kids who aren't ""getting"" math or are bored of their current math curricula. Get the additional 'tougher' practice books (IP and CWP) for your bright kids to experience the full brain training of the Singaporean system.",1338260197

I think if it was in fact a lie it would be much more likely to originate from the engineer in the car.<p>Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. If there's any chance that it's a lie, that's the only way it happens-- the guy at the wheel decided to take the fall without telling <i>anyone</i> else. Maybe he pushed the button by accident, the thing freaked out, and he decided no one needed to know. Possible.<p>But that still doesn't fly. <i>Everything</i> that happens to that car is measured and recorded for later analysis. There is a verifiable record of when it is under human control and when it isn't. Faking that record convincingly enough to cover up the only public accident in the history of the project is almost certainly beyond the capabilities of a single engineer who was just in a fender bender.

The article doesn't really give too clear a definition of support here. It can mean honest to goodness help required or it could mean complaints and demands (often veiled as questions). People who pay the least simply don't value the product as much. They're not willing to put in the time required to learn how to really work it and they're always the first to complain that the one feature just out of their chosen plan should be included.<p>Their lack of perceived value for the service isn't always attributable to price alone either. The fact that they chose the cheapest usually means that they're either just plain cheap or they don't understand how valuable what they're getting is to begin with which leads to the, acting like dummies and being demanding. Now, when I say value in this case I don't mean money. I'm talking about their perception of how useful the product theyre getting is.<p>Besides that minor clarification I totally back this up. The higher priced item will always have more features and attract people who know the value of those features because they're already educated about their benefits most likely because they've used similar solutions before.",1338256990

Technology wise it would be a step forward from the current form of telephony, the consumer on the other hand doesn't care, they just want a product that works in the end and which they can use to communicate with their friends and family.<p>Google has done wonders with android because they attacked a market segment that apple was ignoring, cheaper smart phones for people that don't necessarily care so much about apps.<p>With google's buyout of motorola, im just waiting for the 'free' phone.  where sms and a phone line are free for users in exchange for reading/listening to ads.

I think if it was in fact a lie it would be much more likely to originate from the engineer in the car.<p>We work hard on the systems we build and a simple lie like that could absolutely seem to be in the interest of the project at a time when this technology still freaks-out lawmakers.<p>Should we believe Google?

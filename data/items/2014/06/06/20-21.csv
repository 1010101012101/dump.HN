It has a long history of pandering &#x27;science&#x27; stories.<p>This story for example. Don&#x27;t you wonder how the interior of the glass has stayed so spotless for 40 years? It has to be cleaned, but they don&#x27;t explain how.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s some kind of magnetic cleaner, or maybe he&#x27;s simply opening the bottle up to clean it.

7860244,comment,7858000,7860168,8,0,exratione,,,"One also has to look at the surrounding studies for context and plausibility, not just this one in isolation. For example, I think you are overcautious in your comments on nutrition data in humans for calorie restriction and fasting - there is in fact quite a large amount of support for both benefits and safety in humans, both in the context of augmenting chemotherapy and as a general health practice. There is further an enormous weight of evidence in various mammal species for the benefits of calorie restriction and fasting.<p>In the case of this particular item, referring specifically to alterations to the white blood cell counts and lineages, the human data only goes so far as chemotherapy patients, and not very many of them. Talking about age-altered immune systems is premature. It would not be a surprising result if validated by other researchers, as calorie restriction and fasting are already known to beneficially influence immune function over the long term, but the details here should be taken as merely interesting until someone else runs larger studies to obtain more data.",1402088390

Why fund a cancer drug or space company or whatever when there is no clear case that that is going to make a good ROI (or succeed at all).<p>The perception is that VCs are the money-men behind startups that change the world and make everything better and create value and value. The reality instead is that they have to make money and pay for themselves too, and the surest way to do that is to bet on &quot;safe&quot; products and things the market provably wants.<p>It is a great shame that the narrative is that VC-backed startups are the best actors for positive progress--I don&#x27;t think we could be further from the truth.",1402088304

7860232,comment,7850105,7851409,2,0,dkrich,,,"I actually respectfully disagree with this advice. Delaware LLC&#x27;s are expensive compared to most states (I believe mine was over $300 when I filed plus have high dissolution fees should you need to dissolve it or transfer it to another state plus annual taxes) and don&#x27;t really offer that much compared to other states with much lower filing fees for a business just starting out.<p>The main reason Delaware LLC&#x27;s are so popular is that the laws in Delaware are very business-friendly. However much of this doesn&#x27;t realistically apply to a business just starting out. If you&#x27;re Facebook it makes sense. If you&#x27;re a one-man consultancy with potential liability in the less than $1,000,000 range maybe not so much. As always, this depends on many factors.<p>I know the counter to this is that if you are billing $X00/hour, filing fees for an LLC aren&#x27;t a significant cost of doing business.

Garbage collection is a serious problem for soft/hard real time apps. Understanding performance is difficult too because the VM may be doing stupid things behind your back and you can&#x27;t directly control things like CPU cache locality with this many layers.<p>Porting the VM is also difficult. It is a really complicated piece of machinery, and if you are in truly cross platform environments, getting the VM up on new systems is a massive engineering challenge in by itself. Often these other environments are CPU and memory constrained too which isn&#x27;t great for the .NET VM.",1402088050

7860168,comment,7858000,7858000,31,0,tokenadult,,,"Let&#x27;s look at what the submitted article, which is a press release from a university, says. &quot;In both mice and a Phase 1 human clinical trial, long periods of not eating significantly lowered white blood cell counts. In mice, fasting cycles then &#x27;flipped a regenerative switch,&#x27; changing the signaling pathways for hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for the generation of blood and immune systems, the research showed.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s good about this line of research is that it is trying to show whether or not an observation found in a model animal will also be found in human patients. As preliminary research, this will have to be replicated by other researchers before we can rely on this finding (NOT extended fully to human patients in the current study) to guide treatment of human patients.<p>This is good news that people are investigating this issue. Once there has been a thorough review article on this issue published in a different journal by a different author, summing up several well designed studies, then we will really have something to talk about here on Hacker News.<p>I should comment on some of the other comments here. One very tricky problem in studies of human nutrition is that there isn&#x27;t a good model organism for nutrition and its effect on human health. The study reported here, just like most medical intervention studies, begins in a mouse model. Mice are well understood organisms and their similarities to and differences from human beings for many medical treatments are well understood. Mice are not a particularly good model for nutrition studies, however, because mice are rodents (part of a clade of obligate herbivores) while human beings are primates (part of a clade of facultative omnivores). Moreover, human beings, the current species <i>Homo sapiens,</i> have evolved with co-evolution of the gut in the environment of the cultural practice of cooking food.[1] Cooking is a human cultural universal. No other animal lineage has evolved in a similar environment, so no animal provides a fully suitable model for studies of human nutritional interventions.<p>Human nutrition studies are HARD, because they require minute-by-minute monitoring of the subjects and exact measurements of food intake to gather meaningful experimental data. (I recall a TV news report from the 1970s about a human nutrition study in which the study volunteers, who of course were paid for this, lived confined inside a lab in which lab technicians weighed all their food to the nearest gram and controlled everything they could eat for the duration of the experiment. Alas, I&#x27;ve never heard of results of that study, perhaps because the sample size, with such an expensive procedure, was too small to generate meaningful data.) Yes, let&#x27;s see what nutritional interventions do what for human beings, but let&#x27;s be careful not to jump to conclusions too soon, because careful data gathering on this topic is especially difficult, and anecdotes crowd out data in most popular discussion of this topic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cooking-up-bigger-brains/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cooking-up-bigger-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-10/eating-cooked-food-made-us-human-study-finds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-10/eating-cooked-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-...</a>",1402087212

In small quantities that exist in fruits with the fiber limits the speed of absorption so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the livers primary mechanism for dealing with it.\nBut moderation of sugar is impossible without actually spending time to find how much sugar there is in different products, and cutting those that come with mercilessly until you consume 15 grams of it a day. Its about 1/3rd of smallest coca cola bottle here or single serving of yogurt. I remember some study that majority of food items in market have added sugar in USA so moderating it is extremely hard without spending time to think about it.<p>Also sugar messes up the system that tells the brain that you are no longer hungry, which means if you eat stuff that has sugar in it, it takes longer for you to feel full.<p>Also while there is health reason to exercise burning more calories isn&#x27;t it.

I know the TSA goes through my luggage when I fly, why wouldn&#x27;t the NSA go through my mail?

We do know that when companies are contacted by the NSA, they are barred from even acknowledging that they were contacted.  Again, the first conversation I had about the NSA inserting back doors into consumer technology was in the 90s. This is a novel approach but the general modus operandi is expected.<p>I think most people just don&#x27;t appreciate what the NSA is. This is the organization that invented public key cryptography a decade before Ron Rivest and didn&#x27;t publish the results. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they had made large advances in quantum cryptography that let them crack any cipher based on finite fields. I can imagine that all of this conventional spying is just a red herring to distract from much more insidious capabilities.<p>I can imagine their capabilities extend beyond computer networks to the power grid...<p>The point is that we funnel huge sums of money into an organization that hires the best and the brightest to spy on us. Why would you assume they aren&#x27;t doing that well?<p>But, at the end of the day, I just look at the Snowden &quot;revelations&quot; as another Bengahzi or Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The political opposition will use it as a tool to further their interests but no one really cares. No domestic representative is going to cut funding to the NSA and no foreign government is going to act any differently when it comes to their security. They will get on the news and make a lot of noise as they use this as political cover to advance whatever ax they have to grind.

There should be no way to build and use an invalid query, the same as you can use the type system to enforce any other constraints.<p>> It&#x27;s one thing to use a query builder for those rare complicated dynamic queries, but an entirely different thing to lock down and hide the connection and have your hands at the mercy of an abstraction layer for your every query.<p>Almost any SQL I&#x27;ve written has needed to be composable, for the same reasons that any other code should be composable. I need to be able to get <X> complex set of data from the database, given an identifier which could be an ID, or an URL slug, or any number of other things. I may also need to get that either for one row or for many.<p>It&#x27;s nice to be able to split that up into the bit of the query that selects the data, and the bit of the query that chooses which row(s) to select it from, without writing out the SQL twice or developing &quot;stringly-typed&quot; code. It&#x27;s a standard across most of the software development world that when dealing with source code (which SQL is), you almost always work with ASTs.<p>The frameworks I use for this <i>do</i> allow me complete access to the database, including all the things you&#x27;ve mentioned, and the ability to extend my queries with arbitrary syntax.",1402085732

What that operation is doing is taking something out of the DAG and putting it into the working tree.  It&#x27;s the same deal, the only difference is instead of pulling a tree object (associated with a commit) from the DAG into the working tree, you are instead pulling a glob.  It makes intuitive sense to me that these two operations would  be accessed through the same command.  Furthermore, using the name &#x27;revert&#x27; would make much less sense in the rather frequent case that you want to pull a blob from a commit that is not the current HEAD.  Is it really &quot;reverting&quot; if I am pulling a file from a future commit in another branch into my working tree?

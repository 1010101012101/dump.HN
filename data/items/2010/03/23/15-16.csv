1213232,comment,1213101,1213101,0,0,hga,,,"Hmmm, I started learning it in 1979 (sic) when my major experience was FORTRAN, BASIC, and an obscure language called PPL who's major features I hadn't taken advantage of (it was for a summer class).  I'd toyed with/looked at COBOL, PL/1 and C.<p>The biggest thing, I think, is that it's based on expressions rather than statements, which is rather a different model than the Algol family (more or less) languages mentioned above.  And for me, learning the importance of indentation for code comprehension, but that had already started with my learning C.<p>And then there's recursion; you can't do idiomatic LISP without it (<i>The Little Lisper</i> or nowadays <i>Schemer</i> is good for that).<p>Ideally you'll also learn functional programming; optional in Common Lisp, hard to avoid in Scheme, and there's little point in using Clojure without it.<p>Frankly, I find it delightfully simple.  The conceptual base is small, the syntax of parens, atoms, immediates (e.g. numbers) and special forms (e.g. if) makes is a very regular language, no ""cancer of the semi-colon.<p>It's really quite nifty, and of course back then there was pretty much nothing faster with which to develop software.  You mostly just have to unlearn some stuff and be willing to put in some effort, which will be well rewarded.",1269359987

Is this reasonable?<p>I know HN has been through several equity for non-founders discussions this quarter; there's certainly room for continued debate on whether or not early hires deserve a lot of equity.<p>That leads me to my concern with the requirement in this post's title:  Is it reasonable to expect anyone to build their life around an employer?  Unless the employee is a major shareholder (i.e. cofounder) this seems like it's asking too much.  In this case the prospective engineer would be the first non-founder employee.

This is true of recent policies that simply expand the number of visas granted to foreign scientists to fill empty job slits in industry, and of government R&D support policies that pay little heed to impacts on graduate students.  Expanding imports of young scientists to fill empty slots at bargain wages dampens the market signal that more opportunities and higher salaries would provide to domestic talent...""<p>Zumeta also gives some numbers on what top S/E undergraduates are doing instead of graduate engineering programs (interestingly, it isn't law, it's generally MBA or  health professions.  Of course, there's a potential complication here - Zumeta is only tracking S/E grads with quant GREs above 750, so he isn't considering the undergraduates who decided earlier on that engineering isn't for them (I suspect the US starts to lose most of its engineers in 8th grade).<p>I'm glad you agree that accusing people like Zumeta of being ""xenophobes"" is a little unfair (I think it's more than a little unfair, really, it's a pretty horrendous way to use personal attacks to suppress what should be a fair, honest, and open discussion).

1213220,comment,1212897,1212897,0,0,david_adams,,,"There's a thing called Delayed Sleep Phase Sndrome. It's a circadian rhythm disorder that affects maybe 1/2 of 1% of people (but seems to be more prevalent among engineers and software people, possibly because DSPS sufferers choose vocations that allow for flexible schedules).  Essentially, DSPS people have a natural sleep-wake cycle that's shifted a few hours from the norm.  My natural cycle is to sleep at about 2:30am and wake at 11:30. I can force myself into a ""normal"" schedule, but I can't change my natural circadian rhythm, so I suffer from various effects of sleep disruption that are similar to jetlag.  For some reason, a high proportion of teenagers, particularly boys, experience temporary DSPS during their adolescence.  It can be as many as 20%.  I suspect that the natural creeping of the circadian rhythm that happens during adolescence (as mentioned in this article) kicks into overdrive for some kids, and gives them DSPS-like symptoms during that time. Most of these kids grow out of it and re-establish a normal rhythm into adulthood. People like me, however, keep their DSPS throughout their lives. (And it's hereditary.  I got it from my mother)\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome</a>",1269359860

It will pay for your future treatment as long as the insurance company is legally obliged to foot the bill.<p>You're assuming that the insurance will have money then.  I'm pointing out what it takes to make that assumption true.<p>The relevant term is ""counter-party risk"", aka the ""blood from a turnip"" problem.<p>> the whole point of the insurance business is that a company is not guaranteed to make a profit on each individual customer.<p>While that's true, it's also true that the total payout plus expenses must be less than the total premiums plus any investment income.  Savings and borrowing allows some time-shifting and smoothing but if payouts are too high relative to revenue, the company goes down, regardless of its obligations.<p>You believe that today's young will receive care when they're old that costs more than they'll pay then. Where is the extra money coming from?  It can't be the extra money that they're being asked to pay now because that money is being spent now on today's old people.

1213199,comment,1212704,1212913,0,0,fnid2,,,"You know, philosophically speaking, I'm not sure competition really <i>does</i> help the end user.  Is a constant search for something better good? Is life <i>now</i> bad?  Do we really <i>need</i> it to be improved? Perhaps the idea that it <i>can</i> be improved -- or even <i>should</i> be -- is <i>itself</i> a negativity creator.<p>Beyond those questions, some of the tactics and strategies used by competitive companies don't lead to better lives.  For example, if VHS had never been in competition with BetaMax, our lives would be better because Betamax is better than VHS.  Perhaps if there was less competition, many of the startups that are put out of business every day would survive longer and provide even <i>more</i> better life. Sometimes competition destroys the <i>best</i> alternative.<p>Little things like that make me wonder about our conviction that competition is better.<p>Further still, imagine if all the energy spent competing was spent <i>collaborating</i>!  Imagine if we all focused on a better life, rather than two separate teams focusing on two separate paths to that better life.  Mozilla team + Chrome team <i>could</i> be a better scenario than Mozilla team vs. Chrome team.<p>So, my point is, It's not really that clear cut that competition makes our lives better.  Another example, in many countries around the world with single payer health care systems, the people live longer, have lower infant mortality, and disease than in the U.S. where there is competition for health care provision and insurance.<p>So I'd like to see some evidence for the claim that competition makes lives better and products better. And, even if they do, does it matter that those products have become better?  Does the fact that our lives will be better 10 years from now mean we can't be happy today? Should we not focus on being happy with what we have? If competition weren't the status quo, <i>maybe</i> there would be something existing right now to make our lives better than our lives currently are, but we simply <i>don't know</i> about it. It's <i>not</i> here. It doesn't exist.  If it did exist, perhaps our lives would be better, but we only <i>believe</i> they are better because we can compare our lives with this thing existing with our lives when it didn't exist.<p>Would our lives be better if we could colonize mars?  Would we have been able to colonize mars if we had worked <i>with</i> the Russians during the cold war?  How much more progress would have been made if we had collaborated?  Instead, competition has led to nuclear proliferation -- is that a <i>good</i> thing?<p>If there were only one browser, my life would be better.  I wouldn't have to develop for four... wait, <i>five</i> browsers. I'd be able to spend more time focusing on the features and requirements of the system, rather than IE showing a div a little higher or than Firefox. Or Chrome throwing an error on an Ajax call.  Or adding IF statements to handle key presses.<p>Take it to the logical extreme. What if there were 20 browsers each with 5% market share?  Would life be <i>even</i> better <i>still</i>?",1269359469

Modern C++ code still has pointer math and it still has function pointers. In other words, you still have to learn the trickiest stuff from C.<p>Second, while <vector> is great, it's not a good idea to think about it as a black box. The whole food chain of STL containers from list to dequeue presumes that you understand  the tradeoffs in actually implementing data structures in memory. How do you select and use these things intelligently if you've never even implemented a linked list? You're basically just writing a very verbose and very error prone form of Java.<p>Finally, C++ just isn't a very good language. There is <i>nothing</i> you can do in C++ that you can't deal with in C. There is a clear difference between the outcomes of, say, Perl and Python --- Python code is clearer and more maintainable. There are clear differences between Java outcomes and Rails outcomes --- the Rails code is tighter, smaller, simpler (though perhaps less featureful). Compare giant C and C++ codebases. What's the C++ win?<p>C vs. C++ is a can of worms. I know. But I've spent quality time in both languages and I'm an unabashed fan of C. I think the 2010 answer to the problem C++ wants to solve is ""C and a high-level language"". The future belongs to things like Lua (or Python with a better FFI, or...). C++ is a dead end.",1269358981

I didn't quite get to the part where I would email them, but I was amazed that you spent 6 months on understanding it.

It's tough to catch up years of math without doing it.<p>A peculiar part of it is that some people correlates math with calculations at an early age, the simple arithmetic operations.  Maybe it's unfortunate that it is such an easy metric to see who's better at it - easy negative reinforcement.<p>One of my algorithms professor in college explained to me that in (research) math, it's all about being creative, seeing things and making connections, and teaching understandings.

Foreign companies just see the billions of potential customers, and will bend over backwards (and risk losing investment) to do whatever they need to get access to that potential (and human rights be damned). Even Google is not wanting to pull all of it's business out of China, so they can't really be given too much credit for what they did with just the search engine.",1269357993

I've been writing C since '94 and I guarantee you there's some douchebag who will build an entire website about how little I know about C once the courseware hits Reddit. Pass.<p>The structure I'm chasing is:<p>* C Interfaces and Implementations.<p>* Every month, a couple hours worth of casual exercises, spread over 2 weeks, along with background material and basic courseware (cheat sheets, notes on the book, etc).<p>* ""Tech support"" style assistance for those exercises (ie, send me your code and I'll tell you what's wrong).<p>* Once a month, several hours of lab-style class time. Each class presumes you did the exercises and, if you had trouble, that you chatted me up about them and we got through it. Each class is 2-3 small coding projects. All are security-focused, because that's why we're doing the class; so, for instance, in week 1 we'll probably write an XML fuzzer and a password cracker.<p>* If you came to class prepared, I'm buying unlimited drinks and pork product at The Publican afterwards.<p>I'm planning on the following arc for the class:<p>* Month 1: Basics (Compiling/running, hello-world, malloc and free, the C type system, very basic pointers, using libraries).<p>* Month 2: Network programming (Stevens-style socket programming, binary formats, I/O).<p>* Month 3: Design (Library design, voidstar, function pointers,  dlopen, object-oriented C).<p>* Month 4: Secure programming in C (mostly, memory corruption and string handling).<p>I guess I'm writing all this here not so much to sell a class that I'm not offering publicly so much as to advocate for the idea of doing things like this at your own company, and to solicit critiques. I've spent a long time giving lip service to training and growing a team, and giving up a couple weekends and plying team members with high-end whiskey seemed like a way of putting my money where my mouth was.

During the rest of the hours, I get the so called 'restricted' internet access, where I cannot check web-mails, nor can I download any executables, and I don't have admin access to install anything. Even to install the network printer I need to raise a request to the computer division. I feel sad.",1269356442

It's not full-proof, it just protects you from writing out a query that is not complete.<p>It sort of sucks that in SQL you first say what action you want to perform and then say what you want to perform it on. I end up writing the WHERE part of every query first anyways.",1269356418

Turns out that there are changes associated with puberty (who knew?) that make them wake up several hours later and stay awake longer than children; their cognitive abilities also peak later in the day. From age 18 onwards they revert towards the adult baseline.<p>Assuming you're an adult, do you think you'd work more efficiently if you were rousted out of bed at 5am to start work each morning, and forced to finish at 1pm?",1269356407

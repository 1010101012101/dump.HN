What I see a lot of the time, especially here at Cal, is that nobody wants to work anywhere besides Google, Apple, Microsoft or Facebook.  People don't bother with any company that doesn't have a huge name and since many of these students don't have any prior work experience before applying to these tech giants, they get rejected.

Tests of all kinds should be living, breathing code, just like the code in the rest of your application. As such, tests, like production code, can become outdated and obsolete and need to be updated, changed, and sometimes deleted.<p>However, I do not agree with the idea that tests are evil. If your tests are failing, or breaking regularly, or are hard to write, then your tests are trying to tell you something. Tests are a direct mirror of the state of your code. If your tests are brittle and hard to manage, don't delete the tests, fix your code. If you need to instantiate a tonne of objects in order to make your tests work, fix your methods dependencies and learn to test your methods in isolation of its dependencies.<p>Any production code needs tests, this is non-negotiable in today's development eco-system. But I get tired of people who do not understand the purpose of tests complaining that tests are evil. If there is a problem with your tests, then your tests are telling you there is a problem with your code. Clean up your code in order to clean up your tests. However, remember that as code changes, your tests will need to change as well. It is okay to edit, delete, change tests to reflect the current state of the application. Just change the tests first to express how you want to interact with a specific bit of code and then change the code, not the other way around.",1327948258

In fact, your criticism applies to much of modern medicine where the systems are so complicated and little understood that we can only catalogue observations, look for statistical correlations, construct simple models, study animal models and back hypothesis with little more than logic and statistical arguments/tests. But things are improving thanks to computers, the ability to solve complex non-linear systems numerically is allowing more mathematical models to be developed for fundamentals. But a unified theory of biological systems is a very long ways away. As more fundamental understanding is developed, the best that can be done is inductive inference. As long as there is good design of experiments, meaningful data being collected and studied and peer review, it is not cargo cult science.<p>As for your criticism. Spaced repetition is well backed by experiments and centuries of observation and fits with our growing understanding of memory - see Long term potentiation and PKMZeta.<p>Contextual interference is more tricky as it is not fully understood but it is also long studied. Unlike cargo cult, various hypotheses are being offered, tested and refined. For example, the short-term long term memory observation is based on the observation that in tests of recall, stroke patients with impaired short term memory (regardless of method) and those using the varied examples method performed better after 24h+ than those using blocked practice with functional working memory. The hypothesis being that the constructs active in long term recall are more exercised using the varied examples method, leading to better long term performance. Another hypothesis is that increasing the complexity by interleaving examples increases the challenge level and hence engagement and motivational/reward circuits parts of the brain important for learning. In addition, interleaving examples forces a more general model to be learned, encouraging generalization instead of just short term memorization.<p>The comparison to machine learning (they use ANNs) is: when the examples do not reflect the distribution from which they are coming from, then the learned model is less general. And in particular, when a new set of examples with different properties is trained on it interferes negatively with already learned material. In the paper they give examples of similar occurrences in rats and humans.<p>Finally, it is important to note that randomly interleaving examples is not useful when trying to figure something out - where short term memory is key. The observation is that contextual interference disappears for complex tasks, this is because the information requires more complex processing and integration in working memory. The ability to hold more information and more complex models in working memory correlates strongly with the ability to understand things. Interfering with this process leads to poor performance short and long term. As the material is familiarized, compressed and basic models are composed, difficulty reduces. It is here that interleaving becomes important.<p>The practical implications are when practicing drill exercises, rather than blocking the material according to similarity, interleave the material so a less biased model is formed and the material is more challenging to keep focus. When designing exercises break them up into the core simple, defining examples and interleave these while gradually increasing the difficulty by composing more difficult models from the simpler material and continuing to interleaving these with the simpler basis examples set.",1327947403

There is simply no other text editor out there that can open a single C/C++ source file and automatically infer all tags (even of included headers) without any kind of project set up.

It's keybindings are just a lot more powerful and flexible than Emacs's. And of course, that is what evil-mode is for. It emulates a subset of Vim in Emacs. It is by far the best simulation of Vim I have ever seen (judging from ViEmu, Viper, Vintage, Vico and Vimpulse), but it is not the real thing.

For one thing, a lot of that revenue is return on investment - in the code, in customer relationships, in the ""brand"" generally - in previous years, nothing to do with current headcount.  For another, the distribution is exponential.  A few people contribute many times that million, while the majority contribute less, and many of those at the high end aren't engineers.  So yes, engineers who contribute a million dollars to the bottom line do exist, but they're a very small minority.  I've even been one myself, but not every year.  Everyone in SV seems to think they're firmly established in that elite category.  99% of them are wrong.<p>""If one of these $1m revenue/year (""1MRPY"") engineers starts a company with n 1MRPY engineer friends, is it so crazy to suggest that they might produce $x * n million worth of value over x years?""<p>It's not totally crazy, but it's very unlikely.  Such engineers are rare enough, and in such high demand, and self-directed enough, that you're unlikely to get more than a couple of them to follow one vision even if you're friends.  Then you have to find people with non-engineering skill sets who are as good in their respective fields, and convince them to join you.  Then you'll probably still fail due to factors other than the quality of your personnel.<p>What we're facing here is the compounding of two errors.  Everyone thinks they're in the top 1%, and that being in the top 1% for one skill set is enough to ensure success.  In reality, most startups have average teams and many non-technical obstacles to overcome.  I've been in nine startups myself.

It can not only change the input to A, it can also change if A: B = true to if A: B = false, likewise for if B: C = true.<p>Just saying, that kind of redundancy might be an advantage for evolution, smoothing it's path.",1327946434

The core business of a media company isn't simply to deliver content, but rather it is to leverage that content as a mediation tool.<p>Media companies mediate; they push consumer convenience just as far as they can in return for advertising and distribution dollars.<p>Examples;<p>* Cable companies know just how much money the market will bear for channels they don't even want, for the ones that they do.<p>* Television companies know just how many ads you can tolerate, before time-shifting dominates.<p>* Hollywood knows just how long it can make international markets wait for releases, in return for cheaper distribution and marketing (a global launch would make a publicity tour very hard).<p>* The music industry knows how to set prices so that you'll buy the same piece of music over and over again in different formats.<p>* TV and Movie content gets sold 4 or 5 times over, in theaters, on television, DVDs/blu-ray, online rental, subscription streaming. Only delays and segmentation (both inconvenient for consumers) make this possible.<p>Media companies are the middle-men, the grand-bargain makers,  with their desirable content on one side of the scales, and inconveniences like ads, delays, prices and draconian punitive laws on the other side. Media companies don't mind being hated, that usually means they're doing a good job, as long as you love some of their content - the system still works.<p>This is why the convenience represented by technology presents such a threat, it dramatically alters the bargaining positions of both the content owners and the distributors.<p>That middle-man business must be nearing its end, so the question is; can consumer convenient technological distribution get more return for the content creators, the financiers and backers?",1327946416

Also, having some nice visual feedback when I get one right or wrong would be great.<p>That said, this is an awesome service and I'm going to pay for the premium account just to support the effort.  I'm in the process of switching from a tricked-out gedit along with nano to just using vim, so this is a wonderful resource.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone trying to learn vim.  In the course of just 10 minutes, I've already learned another 10 commands.  Assuming I practice them another day or two, they'll become permanently part of my vim repertoire.<p>EDIT: To clarify what exactly I'm using this service to do: I'm using it to eliminate the constant need to refer to a vim reference card.  The muscle memory will come only from using these commands in vim, but being able to eliminate the need to constantly refer to a vim reference for new commands is a huge plus.  I've already learned 10+ new commands that I no longer have to look up. PS - paid for the premium.",1342450682

If your girlfriend is a Danish citizen or a citizen of another European Union country you can make use of the EU rules regarding free movement of labor, i.e. live and work in Denmark without a visa and without financial requirements, without having employment at hand, without expensive application fees or the other usual obstacles set up to make immigration hard.<p>This follows from the Metock ruling from the European Court of Justice:<p><a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008J0127:EN:HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:...</a><p>In short, the Metock ruling says that the free movement of labor entitles any EU citizen to bring a partner/family member, who is a citizen of a third country such as the US, with her when she moves from one EU country to another for work.<p>To make use of this ruling both of you will have to move to another European Union country to work there for a short period (for example 3 months). You will probably have trouble getting working visa there but your girlfriend can work there as an EU citizen. You don't have to go further away than across the bridge to Malm. It will probably be necessary to marry, since the requirement for unmarried is a ""durable relationsship"", which you may not fulfill in such short period (as I understand it you met recently).<p>You need to live in the other EU country, not just stay there at a hotel. To be well within the requirements your girlfriend should try to work there in what is at least a half time job. She doesn't have to get any kind of qualified job.<p>Though they are reluctant, the Danish immigration authorities are obliged to explain how you benefit from this EU loop hole if you ask them about it. Be sure to ask in detail about the requirements.<p>Good luck, and welcome to Denmark :-)",1342450399

My son the hacker has been startup-minded since before he started high school, so he was part of the pioneer class of an online high school. It was EXTREMELY annoying to him and to me that the online high school, when it was founded, didn't have a pan-school way for students to maintain online conversations, nor did it have an online communication environment for parents who lived all over the world. That was a really bad school community-building fail. My son did get to see both the successes and failures of a startup enterprise by attending that school, which was the goal, and over the long haul will surely be good for his career development, but the ""sucktastic"" (another parent's term) communication with families at that school put me off from signing up any of my other children there.

Great for tinkering.<p>3) Comes with functional game and assets, despite the fact that some of the art is clearly lifted from other popular games and could conflict with licensing and copyright of those games, especially since the content is being sold.<p>4) Comes with associated tool-chain. I've built my own home grown iOS game framework and animation tool set myself so I know the benefits of it and the learning exercise.<p>Things that are not awesome about this:<p>1) Why not open source it? If the goal is get people into iOS gaming, Github is a better option. If the goal is to make money, more complete and flexible game engines such as Unity provide a better experience.<p>2) Anyone who leverages this codebase is doomed to become a droplet in what will be a flood of generic iOS platformers using the same codebase and potentially a lot of the same assets (similar things occured with RPGMaker games). The games will have a similar feel and mechanic to them with make them inter-changable and thus disposable.<p>3) I question how much this actually benefits the code-consumer. If they aren't willing to do this the hard way by learning their own way, my guess is they aren't motivated enough to modify the source code to do anything the framework doesn't already provide. The purchaser is much more likely to look around the code base, and then try to replace the assets and leverage the level-designer to make their own game than actually go out of their way to do something unique. If that is the case this is a poor choice as other frameworks like Unity are way more flexible.<p>4) I'm not particularly impressed with the code sample or the abstractions provided. I've written over 20 games in my lifetime and can tell at a glance that this code is written to do 1 thing, and anything outside the initial feature set will result in brittle and unmaintainable code, or requiring a complete refactoring which nulls the purpose of the purchase in the first place.<p>5) The licensing and price of the download, while not bad for working source for a game for a popular platform, probably doesn't deliver on its value for the reasons stated above.<p>Overall I think its great that we share source code for popular games so we can learn from it. Id does this all the time by open sourcing their most popular game and engine code, like Doom, Quake, etc. The key here is the motivation is to help the industry create better games, and they give away everything for free.<p>I suggest open sourcing the code, and possibly selling the tool-chain and level editor. The author could push more $40 level editor units than they could delivering on the promise of a ""starter kit"" that will more than likely guarantee the consumer's game looks and behaves like every other game on the app store.<p>I commend the effort of the author, but considering the ability to deliver on its promise and the price point I would suggest any interested parties look elsewhere.",1342448359

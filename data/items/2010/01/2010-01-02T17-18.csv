Why?  Because Java allows you to focus on the ""big picture"" optimizations that really make all the difference.<p>On the other hand, given an infinite amount of development time and experienced developers, the C program will likely be much faster.

1. You can predict nothing so don't play short term and don't watch the stock market information, it doesn't help people that spent entire life trying to predict stock market even a bit so it won't help you but it will take a lot of time and will trash your emotions.
2. Buy whenever you have money.
3. Sell whenever you need money (and by need I mean REALLY need).<p>You may postpone buying a little bit if you see declining trend and loosen up a bit on 'really' in 'REALLY need' if you stock is currently worth much more than some time ago and tighten it up if you lost some money on your investments, but I am not sure if that does any good or harm.",1262453623

If you were stocking inventory before selling to American consumers (assuming that you're an American), wouldn't you be the ""intermediate"" buyer responsible for import duties, etc?<p>It sounds like, in some instances, you were providing the goods directly to another distributor or end-consumer. If you imported from China and exported to the UK, would you actually keep inventory in the US? I'm not sure I see many advantages to that approach, except perhaps that you could get your goods to the UK slightly faster and maybe you already had inventory being distributed locally in the US (but shipping twice seems expensive).<p>I already have a corporation and a friendly attorney, so in terms of the regulations, it sounds as if I just need to dig in and start reading and asking my attorney questions.<p>Thanks for the info about UPS and pre-ordering, that's a clever trick I hadn't thought of.

1027390,comment,1027315,1027315,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I view LinkedIn solely as an online resume site. I believe a better route for LinkedIn would be to compete with Monster.com or CareerBuilder and build a social networking job site. With all the ""resumes"" currently stored on LinkedIn it is probably one of, if not the largest, holders of personal job/work experience in the world.<p>A business idea would be to create a mashup of sorts pulling information from users profiles and matching them with potential career opportunities on a job board site. LinkedIn could then charge a premium for providing the user and/or the company with a list of potential job opportunities and/or potential candidates. Taking it one step further would be to incorporate some form of background check/education verification into the platform for the companies. A user could select whether they are open to receive job postings or be included in job searches by companies. They could also select which types of companies they want to be included in. I am sure that LinkedIn could develop some sort of algorithm to provide benefit to the job seeking users while at the same time reducing potential spam in the users inbox.<p>Taking the idea one step further would be to charge a fee for resume assistance in helping users build their profiles to highlight current and past experiences.

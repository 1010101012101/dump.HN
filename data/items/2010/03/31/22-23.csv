1233194,comment,1232825,1232825,0,0,joestump,,,"Hi, I'm the CTO and cofounder of SimpleGeo. Many of your points about sparse documentation, website, etc. are fair. We're about 3 hours old so give us a little time to fill everything in. Lots of work to do here, which is why we hired Andrew Mager to be a developer advocate.<p>1. You can think of us as S3 for location data. Before S3 scaling file storage was a messy, complex, and costly proposition. After S3 it was as simple as posting files to an endpoint. We do this for geometric/location data. We store and index your data and allow you to easily do geospatial queries against your location data.<p>2. We give away 1m calls a month, which is the same that Twitter gives away for free, and <i>more</i> than Google Maps does. The pricing plans are based on what it'd cost to manage your own infrastructure. We'll be adding lots more features, options, data, etc. in the coming weeks/months.<p>3. To the people saying they can just install GeoDjango and PostGIS, I have a few questions. How much time are you spending building and maintaining your own location API? How much does it cost to rent/buy that hardware? Is your location infrastructure multi-homed in three data centers? Does your location infrastructure come with premium content like global weather data and 16m+ business listings? Can it keep up with the real-time geohose from Twitter? Does it do URL callbacks and S3 backups automatically? We handle all of that for you.<p>4. The location marketplace will allow developers to tap into billions of points of interest and previously unattainable features for low monthly costs. For instance, Metacarta and Quova solutions are very much enterprise solutions that cost real money, but they'll be available on demand for small per-drink/per-month costs. We've indexed over half a terabyte of location data (when you're talking about point data that's a lot) that's instantly available to developers.<p>5. We have robust SDKs for the iPhone, including an augmented reality view. The AR view allows you to show a sophisticated AR view of your data, in our API, in about ~10 lines of code.<p>You all are absolutely right that we need to do better at messaging and whatnot. We're working on that. All I ask is you give us a chance and don't dismiss what we're doing as ""just GeoDjango.""",1270073607

1233191,comment,1232887,1232887,0,0,strlen,,,"This is an interesting post, but I have a few points. First, there are certain kinds of error conditions where it's better to crash (producing a core dump) and restart rather than ""swallow"" the condition (even if it's logged). Java attempted to differentiate in this realm by introducing checked exceptions (where you could explicitly say this is an error condition where you can and should recover from, this is an error condition that you might not be able to recover from), but it hasn't had the intended effect (exceptions are simply seen as boiler plate and are wrapped in a try { } catch (Exception e) { logger.error(e); } block; checked exceptions are seen as a mistake).<p>Null pointers are typically be exactly <i>such</i> errors: e.g., you failed to allocate memory and malloc returned NULL, you didn't do proper validation on input or you assumed a key exists in a hash table when it doesn't. Either assumption that pointer is not NULL is an invariant (in which case it's better <i>to crash</i> and leave a core dump), or it's not (in which case the application should do a check for a null pointer).<p>It's also <i>not</i> advised to do complex processing inside signal handlers: the idea is to perform a single atomic operation in a signal handler (e.g., change an integer from 0 to 1), and let the application examine that operation's side effects. For example, there could be a ""should_quit"" integer which when 1 would mean the event loop should terminate and the signal handler would just set that integer to 1.",1270073541

If you remember the good old days, Yahoo was a hierarchy of classified links administered/edited very carefully by humans after user submissions.  You would need to have that layer of edit control by the system admins to prevent abuse, and I'm guessing the resources for that are not here.<p>(I sure wouldn't post my GTD web app in non-relevant classes though!  :)",1184111562
33566,comment,33505,33565,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yep, I know the reasons for tags.  I still think they're a truly bad idea in this context.<p>A limited selection of tags solves one problem, but then creates new agonizing moments for contributors where they try to figure out whether they ought to select one option or twelve.  And a few users, the very ones I probably least want to pay attention to, will assume that their latest blog post about their new GTD web application crosses boundaries in unique ways and would be relevant for all fifty-eight tags.  It takes a strikingly small number of bad results to make tags worthless...and I've seen very few occasions where the tag features of a website are not just that.<p>I could be wrong...but I'd like to see an example of a site in the vein of News.YC that uses tags effectively, before I'd even think about admitting it.",1184110920
33565,comment,33505,33560,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The problem with text match search is that it misses on a step removed concept search.  I'm advocating classification with hierarchy, so that if you were to click on Legal, it would give information on lawyers, on trade marks, on patenting, etc.  I think the answer is to limit the hierarchy to startup related issues, and then users select from this list to classify posts if they want to.   Then we can have a very helpful semantic tool for finding things that search just cant.  ",1184110236

33560,comment,33505,33518,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Am I alone in finding tags to be solving the wrong problem?  The problem tags solve is, ""How do I let contributors do extra work adding meta-data to their contributions?""<p>Making search that works is the right solution to the right problem, in every single case where tags have been used that I'm aware of.  Oh, actually, that's not true...flickr tags are extremely useful (when used by large numbers of people to indicate a particular theme or event).  But tags at News.YC or at Reddit would be a pointless complexification of the submission and browsing experience.  Give me nicely working search (which Reddit didn't have last time I tried it, and News.YC doesn't even try), and I'll never want for tags.<p>In short, I'm very strongly in the camp (assuming I'm not actually alone) that believes tags would be bad for News.YC usability.  Search, on the other hand, would be fantastic.",1184108488

78902,comment,78739,78816,0,0,pg,,,"The problem is that the main dialects of Lisp (CL and Scheme) date from the era when languages were specs.  Now they're implementations.  It just happens that no one has released a good new Lisp dialect in that sense of language.  But no one (as far as I know) has released a good new Fortran in that sense either. <p>Language designers who have what it takes are quite rare: Matz, Guido van Rossum, Larry Wall.  It just happens none of them chose to create a Lisp dialect.  But the problem is not the brilliant failures who are drawn to Lisp, but that e.g. Matz wasn't (quite).",1194907991
78901,comment,78739,78812,0,0,Zak,,,"I think you're right about those mundane reasons, but the community can be a major turnoff too. Try posting a stupid question[0] on comp.lang.lisp - you'll almost certainly get flamed, and maybe get harmful responses[1]. Try the same on comp.lang.ruby or comp.lang.python and you might get some gentle correction, but not outright hostility.<p>[0] A stupid question would be anything you can find out by searching google, reading the manual or possibly digging through a few thousand lines of source code.<p>[1] <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/4c95766a8bdda347"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/4c95766a8b...</a>",1194907917
78900,comment,78706,78810,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The reason they think it is high is because it was historically low from about 1985 to 2000. Most people (especially kids like myself) aren't old enough to remember oil shocks and major wars that drove the price up. At 24, I got used to buying gas during the oversupply of the late 90s. People have short memories and no concept of inflation. My dad swears that gas prices are insane, even though he was paying much more per mile (inflation adjusted) during high school in the late 70s (due to lower fuel economy and the oil shock at the time). <p>The reason they complain is like you said... it has somehow become a really visible number. The morning news here cites the price every single day, as if the price of a barrel of oil was going to determine how my day would go. For once, we actually have something worse (more meaningless) than citing the Dow Jones every day.",1194907880

And when large groups of people work together for a long time they can write anything in C++ (if you have the time and resources you can always start by reimplementing Lisp). <p>But if i want to hack something together for my own purposes I dont have the time to do it in C.

78892,comment,78626,78856,0,0,sohail,,,"I think if you need high baseline of stability while you work on your own stuff, spend some time finding a good long-term consulting gig and then be disciplined about it. If you can get away with working 2/4 weeks, then the other 2 are for your startup. Some clients may want you to report daily, in this case, I would suggest that you work half as long as a normal work day to fulfill their reporting desires. Its a bit more annoying but once you build trust, I'm sure they wouldn't have a problem.",1194906365

I moved to LA for 1-1/2 years to give it a shot.  <p>Problem is, the TV/film industry is big, fat bloated and filled with nepotism.  Junior Studio Execs in charge of nothing drive around in Mercedes 7 series, because their uncle got them a job.  <p>At the same time, there are literally tens of thousands of talented artists who are broke and underemployed.  If someone can figure out how to let the artist sell straight to the consumer, the industry is <i>over</i>.  It's ripe and ready to be plucked from the tree. <p>Viva la revolucion digital!",1194905772

3736621,comment,3735388,3736477,1,0,el_zorro,,,"I would think that people view car theft as more morally consequential than copyright infringement because of its tangible nature. If someone takes a car, someone else is now missing a car. However, if someone were to illegally download a song, nothing irreplaceable is taken (i.e. the artist isn't deprived of the music they have created).<p>I would also think that the relative value of the items makes a difference ethically. Assuming a song has a value on the market of $1 and a car has a going price of $10,000, the car is four orders of magnitude more expensive. Imagine if only one person could own a song at a time, and that song was valued the same as a car. I don't think you would see the rates of copyright infringement that you see today. For this same reason, I disagree that if car theft became consequence-free, many people would do it. The moral consequence is derived from the value of the object you are depriving someone of; a car is far more valuable than a song. Additionally, there's the ethical consequence of depriving someone of transportation, while taking a song does not really have any effects on a person's quality of life.",1332363583

Popularity, especially, adds utility to a piece of music and is very difficult to predict in advance.  In fact, I think popularity dominates the utility that many content consumers derive from music.  Sometimes <i>auteurs</i> manage to produce something that defies your expectations and gives you much more utility than you thought it would have.<p>If you retain the right to seek rents on content you've produced, you're able to charge what's appropriate to the utility that consumers <i>currently</i> derive from your music, rather than what they'd have expected to when you made it (nothing, if they'd never heard of you!).  If you can't seek rent on the products of your labor, then you have to get compensated for it directly.  Currently, musicians do this mostly via live performance, but I suppose holding content for ransom via some sort of kickstarter-analogue might be a viable way forward.<p>If I had to guess, I'd guess that there's less money in that sort of thing than rent-seeking, but I'm certainly not an expert.  If there's less money in it, then there will be less high-quality content.  I've thought about it, and I think I'm okay with that.  If the market for recorded music contracts due to digital sharing, I think I'll live, and I'd prefer digital sharing to remain possible.<p>It's unfortunate for musicians, but I guess I'm just a callous soul.",1332363006

My claim is that labels, publishers, and music producers will exploit artists if copyright does not exist. I'm not trying to defend the business model of big music labels, so the example of Jade Ewen is neither here nor there. I'm defending the idea of limited intellectual property rights, because without them artists would be at an even greater disadvantage.<p>It's easier to see the problem in publishing or the game industry than in music, since musicians can make money from performances. Taking your example of Mendelssohn, he made his money from holding concerts and getting stipends from German monarchs. Authors and game designers can't hold performances, so the only way they can make money is by actually selling copies of their work, which requires intellectual property rights, or by hoping to attract a rich sponsor.  If Amazon could sell books without having to give any royalties to the copyright holders, they would.<p>The idea that copyright only benefits the select few in the music industry isn't true, either. Labels often get caught plagiarizing songs that were written by small artists and handing them to big-name artists that they have under contract. With copyright, the smaller artists have an uphill battle. Without copyright, they have no weapons whatsoever.",1332362782

3736496,comment,3735388,3736286,1,0,DanielStraight,,,"Except Apple <i>is</i> a bunch of creative people. So is Kurzweil and O'Reilly and, heck, even Starbucks.<p>Markets are not pay-what-you-want, because pay-what-you-want implies $0 is an acceptable price. At least that's how I was using the term. Apple will not accept $0 for an iPad. If you don't accept their price, you don't get the iPad. That's why people buy it.<p>Copying media lets you get it even if you don't accept the price. Which means the only reason to pay is because you <i>want</i> to.<p>My contention is that making people pay in order to enjoy a product is often what provides the money necessary to exercise creativity. The iPad could be improved by an individual working alone with their own funds, but it never could have been created that way. Without profits from previous products, the creative people at Apple who designed the iPad never would have had the resources to do so. We have iPads today precisely <i>because</i> Apple is closed.<p>What is the next innovation in personal computing? Who will come up with it? Will it be Apple or someone on Kickstarter? My money is on Apple. Even if it is someone on Kickstarter, will they be able to raise the probably millions of dollars necessary to make a viable consumer product? Unlikely.<p>A system in which producers pay upfront and then recoup costs is actually better for consumers. You get to see the finished product before deciding whether or not to spend your money. If the finished product sucks, only the producer loses. If the finished product of a Kickstarter project sucks, everyone who contributed loses.<p>How many iterations do you think it took Apple to perfect the iPad? Each of those would have to have been separately funded on Kickstarter for that system to produce the iPad. I doubt even the costs of one iteration could be raised.<p>But when you cut off the ability to recoup production costs, you cut off the incentive to <i>pay</i> upfront production costs. Which cuts off the funding to creative people who are doing important work.<p>The problem with only being able to collect voluntary payments (pay-what-you-want, Kickstarter, etc.) is that people don't necessary know they want something until it's done. The 1st iteration iPad probably sucked. So why would people fund it? If Apple builds an iPad, it only takes a few people's shared vision to make it happen. If a Kickstarter project wants to build something as innovative, it will required the shared vision of everyone contributing. You'll have to convince thousands of people that it's worth funding numerous iterations at thousands, or possibly even millions, of dollars, in the hopes that the final product will be good. I just don't see this happening.",1332362450

At a purchase of $210M, this represents a multiple of 2.2x, far below the price/sales multiple of Zynga and Glu Mobile, two publicly traded companies on the US exchange. Sure, OMGPOP probably won't be hitting $250,000/day for the entire year but even at a 50% discount, you're in the same range as Glu.<p>DAU cost: Assume CPI of $1.50, install/DAU conversion rate of 10%. This equates to a DAU cost of ~$15. It's safe to say that OMGPOP has >10M DAU, which means ZNGA bought the company at <$20/DAU. Additionally, the above CPI and install/DAU conversion rate are quite low. I've been hearing that OMGPOP is seeing 1-day retention rates of 50-75% which is amazingly high. This means that with continued growth and similar retention rates, ZNGA got a pretty good deal in terms of DAU acquisition cost.<p>The main advantage for Zynga is that they can leverage OMGPOP's DAU and cross-promote their existing titles.

Also, things are generally available for piracy way earlier (we're talking months in some cases) than they are on iTunes. That is a huge, massive inconvenience.<p>As for prices, yes, iTunes is also much too expensive for many things  when I can buy a physical copy and have it shipped crosscountry to my house for a fraction of the cost of iTunes' lousy crippleware, something is wrong  but that seems beside the point. Yes, a lot of piracy happens because it's free. Most of that piracy doesn't really seem to be replacing sales and so isn't really relevant from an economic standpoint. Those people just want something for free. It seems like the point where piracy really becomes a problem is when it's the superior option even for people who could easily afford to buy your wares.",1332360306

Wrong.</i><p>It would be better if you spend some time to understand what they MEANT with by ""content"" in their statement, instead of attacking their statement ""as given"", i.e with only considering the more basic meaning of the word content.<p>Also: it's not just that ""undistributed content might as well not exist"", it's also that content not done to a level the public wants ""might as well not exist"".

I don't have to ""prove"" anything, it's obvious.<p>1) People produce content for two reasons: for free and because they are paid to do so.<p>If they are not paid, the second reason ceases to exist. (If you don't believe that some of the professional content creators would not produce stuff if there were no money involved, talk to some of them). A lot of content is not produced ""out of passion"" at all, but solely for money. Justin Bieber songs, hollywood blockbuster, etc.<p>2) Content creation costs money. If content is not paid, expensive content will not be produced by anyone, even those that do it out of passion. A money, which can get to $100 million budget easily, is expensive content.<p>3) Content creation takes time. If professional creators cannot do it as a full time job, they will work some other full time job, and if they still feel the urge to do it out of passion, they would do it on their spare time.

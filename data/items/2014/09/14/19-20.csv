It was horrifyingly bad, but perhaps by that time (2002-2004) it was suffering serious impedance mismatch with the rest of technology which had moved on. Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good example :)<p>Regardless, that was kind of my point - all these systems are only good as long as you stay within their constraints. The unfortunate thing is that the constraints always end up being way too tight in practice.",1410724722

It&#x27;s also a good way to uniform code, make things easier for new comers (larger projects usually have lots of new people that eventually write code), solve multiple common issues you&#x27;d fight by your own (e.g. browsers compatibility), community support and documentation.

What I&#x27;m arguing is the (lack of) utility of the explanation.  In what way does it enhance, support, or in any way contribute to the article?  His argument is essentially:<p>A. We think of light as traveling in straight lines.<p>B. But because quantum physics, they don&#x27;t!  They travel along infinitely many paths.<p>C. But all of these paths cancel out except the straight line path.<p>D. And that&#x27;s how beamforming works.  Except it&#x27;s beam-un-forming.<p>So he brings up a quantum phenomenon to complicate the scenario, then immediately reduces it back to the original scenario, without ever explaining how that original scenario works (i.e. how waves add together to create constructive and destructive interference: note that the words &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;phase&quot; never occur in same paragraph), then claims that this is somehow elucidating.

Our customers didn&#x27;t anticipate this shift (customers don&#x27;t know what they want until they see it in some cases) and we, when the other business model came about, didn&#x27;t recognize its significance.

There are some nuances in the way the original question is framed. So the framing that &#x27;a way to quickly and accurately determine if your idea is on the right track&#x27; is not good - ideas aren&#x27;t good or bad, they are never on the right or wrong track - they are what they are, just ideas. Its the execution of an idea that paves the way and propels the idea in a specific direction. So, while there isn&#x27;t (and may never be) a great tool/process/discipline to evaluate ideas - there are tools/processes/disciplines available to evaluate execution.<p>So, I read the question slightly differently - and I would say there is definitely something here.

The Tesla S has a very smooth underbody because of the flat battery unit and because it requires no exhaust system. Air intakes are kept to a minimum, because it does not need to dissipate the copious waste heat produced by a combustion engine.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to detract from the marvellous engineering efforts by the Tesla team, but the Model S is in a class of one. Large sedans from mainstream manufacturers come very close to the aerodynamic performance of the Model S, but the use of internal combustion puts them at an inherent disadvantage. Competing all-electric cars are predominantly cheaper and shorter vehicles, designed for the European city car market. The high price of the Model S allows Tesla to use a lot of trick aero features, like the bladed mirror mountings, active inlet vents and retractible door handles.<p>I have no doubt that the traditional manufacturers could match the aero performance of the Model S if they were to produce a car with a similar form factor and price; The Mercedes CLA BlueEfficiency exceeds the aerodynamic performance of the Tesla S, as one of the few large and expensive cars that have been optimised primarily for efficiency. Volkswagen manage a drag coefficient of just 0.159 with the XL1, but it costs $146,000.",1410723504

The Slack &quot;app&quot; is just a packaged version of WebKit and has almost zero customizations. Worse of which is that there isn&#x27;t a per-channel setting to hide images by default, since I&#x27;ve had no luck getting folks to stop posting animated gifs into the general channel. I&#x27;m not at work right now in order to speak to the specifics, but the Slack app doesn&#x27;t handle that situation correctly at all.<p>And the notification is merely a red dot. Oh, you only want the red dot if you&#x27;re at-mentioned or someone posts in your team&#x27;s channel? Too bad.<p>If you just distribute your site&#x27;s webpage as an app, you&#x27;re phoning it in. And <i>that</i> is why I want a chat company to use XMPP so that I <i>can</i> use Adium to manage my interaction (or lack of it) with the chat service.<p>I&#x27;m glad you like Slack.

For example, if you look only at the &quot;married couples without children&quot; bar, it has remained basically constant since 1970.  If you take the &quot;married with children&quot; graph by decade and drop the intervening ticks, you get:<p>1970: 40.3% - 1980: 30.9% - 1990: 26.3% - 2010: 20.9%.<p>There&#x27;s a large decline here, but notice that over half of the decline happened during the 1970s, and then the rate of decline slowed significantly before accelerating again between 2010-2012.<p>When I look at the data, the conclusion I draw isn&#x27;t &quot;Most Americans are single, and that&#x27;s changing the economy&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;In bad economic times, young Americans delay making major life commitments like marriage and children, and the 1970s and 2010 are marked by significant economic uncertainty.&quot;  In other words, BusinessWeek has yet again confused causation and correlation.

8315955,comment,8314354,8314670,4,0,kordless,,,"> Please keep in mind I spent two and a half years building this game as a side project, so make a serious offer.<p>I hear you are stressed out by dealing with the resulting success of your game and are willing to shutter it to save your sanity.  I also hear you want someone to &#x27;take you seriously&#x27; in making an offer for the game.  Those two statements, if I am hearing you correctly, are in direct logical conflict with each other and may lead to causing you more suffering.  The technical term is cognitive dissonance, literally believing two things at once.  In your case you appear to hold the opinion that the game is worth something and you must be paid for it to release it, yet you thinking about continuing to manage it will lead to a loss of sanity.  Resolving this logical dilemma sounds impossible, unless someone pays you a lot of money or you really intend to shutter it.<p>I would suggest that if you intended to shutter it because of suffering reasons, you would have already done so by now.  That may be related to the fact those-who-create live to do so. I am one of those people!  If that is the case, you must face the fear of continuing the game&#x27;s existence.<p>Attempting to face a fear you are capable of facing will help move you forward past this event.  Perhaps Open Source it, or take the other suggestions offered in the thread.  I appreciate the fact you took the time to tell us about it. Creating brings joy.<p>Remember, your suffering is your choice.  Only you can reduce it.  Only you can wake up in the morning and be grateful you are here in this reality and then attempt to reduce your suffering by facing your fears for the day.  Nobody else will do this for you as we&#x27;re all trying to do it for ourselves each day.  Best of luck to you, my friend; today is the first day of the rest of your life!",1410722047

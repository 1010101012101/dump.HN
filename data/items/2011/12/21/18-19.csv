3378622,comment,3377525,3378595,1,0,geebee,,,"Unfortunately, we can't know this without analyzing drop-out rates.  Anecdotally, I was a PhD student at Berkeley and I personally know grads of IIT and elite european universities who did drop out (including one student who failed even the MS exam).  So I'm skeptical, but I don't have the data.  I would want to analyze drop out rates, as well as time to completion, and see if they are far better for international students.<p>I did feel at something of a disadvantage, not because my math education was poor (I was a math major), but because US students specialize later.  In college, US students do much more general ed.  I spent some time in France as a teenager and was surprised to discover that at age 13 I was going to have to pick a track (letters vs science)... I returned to the US at that point, so I completed my high school in the US.<p>I think that a broad education can be helpful in STEM fields in ways that are not predictable, but if you're hitting advanced stochastic processes for the first time, and the student next to you did this course already as an undergrad, you're at a disadvantage - but that advantage may be a temporary one, and the benefits of a broader education may well kick in later.

If I feel the items are extremely valuable, I should be prepared to personally pay substantial amounts to keep them safe.  So I buy insurance, door locks, whatever.  And for the betterment of society, we all pay taxes so that firemen can do their jobs and give us general protection of all property.<p>What money has the RIAA paid to keep things safe?  Their only contribution so far seems to be raising the blood pressure of everyone else.  Lawsuits count as raising blood pressure.<p>The RIAA has the audacity to complain that Google spent ""only"" 60 million protecting things?  Is Google a security company that advertises protection services?  Even if it was, shouldn't the RIAA be footing the bill?

I never had any .doc compatibility problems.<p>Today, I'm working for a small retail company in Madrid, Spain: Ten people, running Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. All of us are using OpenOffice. It already was that way when I came here a year ago. Until now, I heard nobody even <i>mentioning</i> our office software.

In my case, a large number (>100) jurors were dismissed for what did not appear to be any reason, so it may have been something else I said or something I wrote on the questionnaire they gave us.  I was also surprised by the number of dismissed jurors, since I was led to believe (mostly, I think, by Law & Order) that there was a limit on the peremptory dismissals.<p>On the elevator on the way out, other dismissed jurors congratulated my on a novel way to avoid jury duty.

My view (biased, but not self-interested) is that the piece is both well researched and biased, and that the research produced the bias.

WebSockets doesn't actually break message boundaries, it just might fragment a message without telling you the full size up front. The basic ""problem"" is that if you receive a 1kb fragment with no size indication, and you expose an API that is entirely based on messages and events, then you have to start buffering. But what if the message is a 5gb .iso file of your favorite DVD? Well, there's no way to predict that so you might have to dynamically allocate a monstrous buffer, which is just painful.<p>There's two ways to respond to this: 1) claim that websockets is broken and all client APIs should be streaming or 2) not unexpectedly send multi-gigabyte messages.",1324493520

Now, that certainly doesn't mean there aren't any, but by and large I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of US citizens are either ambivalent or in opposition when it comes to SOPA. The only groups that are for this bill, so far as I can tell, are big content providers and their lobbies.<p>If almost no one is in favor of a piece of legislation, and there are millions vehemently opposed to it, why in God's name is it still being considered?

My point was that the cost structure for a STEM degree for someone who did K-12 in the US is different from someone who went to a good program in, say, Poland, where I'm told that until recently they would skip calculus and directly teach real analysis in high school. So the cost/benefit ratio is high for the US citizen, but that's not an argument against allowing qualified STEM immigration as a stopgap measure until K-12 is fixed.

What about doing sales distribution deals with companies in a similar space, so you can piggyback on their sales and marketing efforts, thus reducing your need for upfront CoCA?<p>Come on, you're so creative at finding ways around these kinds of things that I have a hard time believing all that's left is to take a pile of VC like everyone else does.",1324493174

So I do criticize PHP on many fronts, from its psychotic language decisions to it's slapdash internals and it's blatant encouragement of idiotic programming practices.

The original WebSocket protocol was a simple stream of delimited messages, with the only complexity being in the handshake that was necessary to ensure that JavaScript apps couldn't send arbitrary data to arbitrary ports without permission.<p>The problem is that the original handshake wasn't good enough (there were still security vulnerabilities despite he handshake), and when Ian Hickson decided to hand over control to the IETF, the architecture astronauts took over, adding complex framing with six different frame types, subprotocols, extensions, versions, complex bit twiddling required to parse frame headers, fragmentation of messages into smaller frames (which is what this article is complaining about), control frames interleaved with fragmented messages, numeric status codes <i>and</i> textual close reason strings that ""MUST NOT"" be shown to the user, masking of data by xor'ing with a random value that changes for each frame, but only for one direction (client->server), a two-way closing handshake on top the existing TCP mechanisms for closing the connection, pings to test the connection for liveness, and so on. There are six registries defined for IANA to keep track of <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml</a>; extensions, subprotocols, version numbers, close codes, opcodes, and framing bits.<p>And despite all of this over-engineering and attempt at extensibility, all extensions must know about each other, because there is no standard method for delimiting different extensions' data (or even specifying how much data an extension uses), and there are three header bits and 10 frame types that all extensions must share. And I don't really know why there's a need for subprotocols on top of the ability to just encode that information in the URL.<p>It's kind of sad how what could have been a relatively simple and easy to implement protocol has been taken over by architecture astronauts. Yes, a few of these features are actually required to securely deploy websockets (the handshake and masking). Most of them are people making up features that would be nice in theory, instead of implementing something simple that works.

""The People vs The System"". This is not how history works, and it is a mistake to view it as such.</i><p>Not at all. I'm recognizing that huge groups of people spread out over vast distances in <i>similar</i> circumstances, <i>forced upon them</i>, each individually decides that surviving by going along is the correct decision. If you don't mind, I'd like to switch this part of the discussion from Germany to China, just because I know the details much better.<p>Of course the experience of every individual is different. Some are farmers, some are urban, some are wealthy and some are poor. Central to my point is the fact that at some point in time, despots have put the same shackles onto all of these people (other than their chosen supporters). If you were in China during the Cultural Revolution, it didn't make very much difference whether you lived in Shanghai or in the mountains somewhere. Every person in that vast nation (one made up of many different cultures, it's worth pointing out) was forced to submit to Party Rule.<p>That submission involved performing the actions that you were told (down to performing a ridiculous dance in honor of Mao), saying the things you were told to say. Above all, you needed to avoid any appearance that you were not another person struggling for Communist progress. Because others needed to prove their own allegiance, you always needed to take pains not to allow the slightest excuse to be denounced.<p>It's absolutely legitimate to generalize the experience of these people. I've concluded this not just from reading history books, but from intimate conversations with dozens of people who actually experienced it (and hence, no citations you can look up; sorry). So I can assure you that in at least the Chinese case, I'm not generalizing from crappy books: I'm getting the story directly from a diverse group of first-person observers.<p>It didn't matter that there was other politics going on with Jiang Qing, or that the movement itself was a maneuver to consolidate power over other officials like Deng Xiaoping. The fact that those other people in positions of power had their own interests was of absolutely no concern to the Chinese masses. There was, indeed, a single party line that everyone must follow.<p>Getting back to Germany...<p>I have less in the way of first-person reports from those fleeing Germany. Honestly, I can only think of one non-Jewish person (if you want to leave them out of the discussion for some reason) meeting the description. But in my conversations with him, he makes it clear that pre-war Germany was not a nice place to live.<p>So I don't think I'm guilty of reifying generalities, when so much of what I'm think is coming not from generalities, but from individual specifics delivered by the actual participants.<p><i>I don't understand your counter-argument re Germany. I said that most people had absolutely no motivation to go against the Nazis because they were benefiting from their rule.</i><p>This is simply false. In some ways the people did benefit from Nazi rule. The chaos of Weimar hyperinflation was checked, they had renewed nationalistic pride. But there are countless reasons for Germans to be motivated to oppose the Nazis. But, for example, the economic success came at the price of throwing women out of work, and requiring men to perform national service. Later in the '30s it became mandatory for Aryan young people to join the Hitler Youth. And, of course, there's the simple moral objection to seeing one's neighbors -- the Jews, Communists, homosexuals, etc. -- treated so badly. There were innumerable reasons for Germans to dislike Nazi rule.<p><i>""Most people"" don't care about minorities like Haffner. Look at the immigration issue in the US today.</i><p>Are you saying that the widespread anti-immigration sentiment in the USA shows that people don't care about minorities? If so, I find that difficult to believe. I see little evidence that many people object to those racial minorities that already live and work with us here in America. The objection appears to me to be more related to (a) economic ignorance and the belief that immigrants steal jobs, etc.; (b) the opportunity for abuse of the welfare system; and (c) the incorrect belief that immigrants, not having achieved stability, are more likely to commit crimes.<p>To tell you the truth, I grudgingly half-agree with you that most people don't care about minorities, at least here today in the USA. While most people give lip service to ideas like universal human rights, that seems to be little more than hot air. If people really believed it, there would be much less grumbling about free trade, outsourcing jobs and manufacturing, etc.<p><i>In fact, people use the same logic as you have to question ""why is nobody resisting Obama?""</i><p>I'm having trouble reading this in the same context as your comments about immigration and minorities, since I don't see that Obama has done very much with the status quo in those areas.<p>Perhaps you mean that sentence to stand on its own, in which case I agree with you (and would also agree with you had you applied the same question to GWB). Indeed, a more generalized writing of that question is what I'm trying to ask. And I can provide generalities of an answer, regarding the relative values and risks to the individual's utility function overall. But I'm interested in more specifics, about where the lines between abstract values and material values get drawn.",1324490929

NOP&#x27;ing out the call instruction is the subtle part, but if you can ensure that all your calls to this function are 2-byte calls and aligned, then everything works out great.<p>Direct calls on x86 are 5 bytes so NOP&#x27;ing them out atomically is a bit more difficult; two ways of doing it I can think of: [1] use an 8-byte load/store, or [2] ensure the displacement part is aligned, and overwrite it with the address of a single RET instruction so the call immediately returns. The first way could be slower but effectively NOPs out the whole call, the second is simpler and faster to do but leaves the useless call/ret (while still eliminating the compare/branch.)<p>Incidentally, doing this is much easier on RISCs like MIPS and ARM thanks to fixed-length instructions (that automatically align), and they tend to have much shorter pipelines too so the flush penalties are lower.",1402120669

I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around this, but in the meantime I&#x27;ll quibble about one tiny throwaway aside:<p><i>DISPATCH_EXPECT is a macro that tells the compiler to emit code that tells the CPU that the branch where 8predicate is ~0l is the more likely path. This can improve the success of branch prediction, and thus improve performance.</i><p>While this is what the macro would do on processors that support such code, x86/x64 isn&#x27;t one of those processors (Itanium was).  Instead, it&#x27;s more important purpose here is to hint to the compiler (not the processor) to lay out the conditional in assembly such that the expected result is on the faster &quot;branch not taken&quot; path.<p>That said, is the actual implementation of the &quot;write side&quot; viewable online?",1402120574

(Whether this applies to Wikileaks is a different story. Different facts.)<p>The slightly more detailed answer is that the modern jurisprudence relating to the First Amendment is far more speech-protective than it was when the EA was codified a century ago.

It has had version issues in the past, where code that compiles with one version does not compile with a later version.  If you are creating a library, using Boost forces the users of your library to also depend on Boost... in particular, to depend on the SAME version of Boost as what you used, which could be a problem if they are already using a specific version.<p>In general, Boost is just a huge library.  Using it may make your code unfamiliar to people who don&#x27;t know the whole huge library, because there is a strong temptation to start using random parts of the library.  Additionally, the style of Boost doesn&#x27;t always mesh well with the coding style you are using.  This is why Google, for example, bans boost except for a small number of approved functions.<p>When I&#x27;m on Stack Overflow, I always end up downvoting a lot of answers that don&#x27;t answer the question being asked.  &quot;You are dumb for wanting to know the answer to this question,&quot; no matter how politely it&#x27;s phrased, is not an answer.",1402119881

The standard library implies some structure with things like `json:&quot;name,omit_empty&quot;` but that structure is not actually specified AFAIK. And I seem to recall finding a github issue where the core team said they don&#x27;t intend to specify one, basically for the reason that they don&#x27;t want struct tags to be used for things like this systematically, but I couldn&#x27;t google it up. If they fully &quot;specify&quot; struct tags I think they fear massive metadata additions, instead of little annotations here and there.

Like most other such problems, the only solution is a major class action lawsuit like the one against Uber. I have no doubt whatsoever that given a fair trial, any competent judge or jury would see abuse here, if for no other reason than they are forced to work at specific times in a specific place. There is just absolutely no way you can justify this as consulting work when they cannot decide either the time or location of the work being done. There are other obvious violations but these are so egregious, it&#x27;s revolting. Of course, you have to see the lawsuit to its conclusion because the Labor department doesn&#x27;t give a shit about labor laws being broken and will tell you as much when you try to bring that up.",1453737450

Objective-C, being a strict superset of C, makes it very easy to use Core Audio, for instance. OpenGL interop can also be a bit frustrating.<p>4) Swift&#x27;s &quot;functional&quot; idioms are weak and poorly implemented. If you can&#x27;t provide a true functional backdrop to these features, they probably shouldn&#x27;t even be in there. Coming from a real functional language, you&#x27;re in for nasty surprises in Swift if you casually use higher-order functions all over the place, because there is a lot of copying going on.<p>5) Swift&#x27;s performance is definitely not, shall I say, &quot;swift,&quot; though hopefully that will eventually improve.<p>6) Poor and confusing compiler errors.<p>I actually realize now that I could go on all day about this.",1453737381

But that&#x27;s the only kind of bloody-mindedness that could ever get you to an &quot;average American home&quot; filled with 300k &quot;things&quot;.  If you have any LEGO sets, each one of those little one-stud circular pips would have to count as a separate thing.  But your dining room table would also be one thing.<p>We already have cromulent measures for the muchness of one&#x27;s stuff in terms of kilograms (or pounds) and liters (or cubic feet).<p>If I plug an old ATA drive into an old chassis, does my thing count decrease by one, because I have the same number of computers but fewer loose hard drives?  The volume remains the same, though it is arranged more efficiently.  You traded empty space inside the case for empty space outside of it--in theory, you could store baby clothes in there instead of hard drives.  The mass also remains constant.<p>In any case, I would not get that number from an anti-hoarding or de-cluttering consultant.  I would objectively measure the change in mass of a moving truck after a household has loaded all their possessions essential enough to move between houses, but not essential enough to keep it under direct supervision.  And by assuming that the truck is packed as densely as possible, you can also get a subjective estimate of total volume of possessions.<p>That would be a really easy way to estimate the median mass of possessions in an American home, without any of the temporary clutter that gets trashed instead of moved.  And there would be no thing-equivalence between a dining room chair and a pencil stub, or between a television and one coupon in the junk mail, or between a refrigerator and an ice pack.

Since price difference between eBook and eBook+print is just $10, I usually buy paper book too (for backup).

It means that I can read until the exact point that I feel like I am drifting off to sleep without needing to get up and turn out the light.  Obviously this is good for light fiction.

Also, one should question the relevance of any information retrieved after long sustained periods of torture when surely facts on the ground have probably changed significantly.<p>Moreover this person, in the stanford thing, is a petty thief who is quite likely to fold under pressure since the crime has manageable consequences for him, and he doesn&#x27;t possess training and motivation to withhold info at all costs.

So it makes sense to see power as an increasing or decreasing value overall with time.<p>100% power in 1500 A.D. is very different than 100% power now (if percentage of power makes sense at all considering how dependent it is on circumstance).<p>The other thing about power is that there are power singularities.  If I can cause the death or pain of another as part of a transaction either actively (gun to the head) or passively (they will starve without the transaction taking place), that person will spend almost any amount of value to avoid that fate. This  kind of exploitation should be taken into account.<p>Power does not always, or even most of the time, create opportunities for exploitation.  If someone has some base level of power to avoid the singularities as described above they can have transactions with more powerful entities that are not exploitative at all but of mutual value gained benefit.<p>Hitting a perfect zero sum game is a very simplified case and only useful as a rough approximation because most transactions are merely /close/ to zero sum with some value add otherwise the market would rush in to narrow the gap.<p>So, a more interesting model would take both the creation and destruction of wealth into account as well as the opportunities for exploitation (since, while those are not the bulk of transactions, in today&#x27;s world they are still incredibly common).<p>This would be more interesting because it would show 1) how various levels power changes over time beyond the relative measure and 2) how prone each group is to exploitation.<p>If certain conditions lead to the lowest tier group having increasing power over time and reduce their exploitation potential but lead to large increases in the gap of relative power, that would be a much better outcome than if they have less overall power and are in more exploitable conditions but their gap of relative power is smaller, for example.",1453735368

If there was any DES software in the boot ROMs, it would have been illegal to ship Sun Workstations overseas, since DES software was officially considered an export controlled munition.<p>To address that problem, John funded and helped build Deep Crack [1], a hardware DES cracker, whose purpose was to prove that it was well within the capabilities of the NSA to crack DES (which they lied to deny), since EFF could do it for a few hundred thousands of dollars.<p>They published a book with the VHDL source code so you could build you own, which didn&#x27;t include a floppy disk because that would have been considered a munition, so they printed the checksummed source code in the book along with software to reliably bootstrap scanning it in and validating it.

In response to DES Challenge II-2, on July 15, 1998, Deep Crack decrypted a DES-encrypted message after only 56 hours of work, winning $10,000. This was the final blow to DES, against which there were already some published cryptanalytic attacks. The brute force attack showed that cracking DES was actually a very practical proposition. Most governments and large corporations could reasonably build a machine like Deep Crack.<p>>Six months later, in response to RSA Security&#x27;s DES Challenge III, and in collaboration with distributed.net, the EFF used Deep Crack to decrypt another DES-encrypted message, winning another $10,000. This time, the operation took less than a day – 22 hours and 15 minutes. The decryption was completed on January 19, 1999. In October of that year, DES was reaffirmed as a federal standard, but this time the standard recommended Triple DES.<p>>The small key-space of DES, and relatively high computational costs of Triple DES resulted in its replacement by AES as a Federal standard, effective May 26, 2002.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker</a><p><pre><code>    John Gilmore {sun,pacbell,uunet,pyramid,amdahl}!hoptoad!gnu    gnu@toad.com\n    Love your country but never trust its government.\n        -- from a hand-painted road sign in central Pennsylvania</code></pre>",1453735155

If I were a voracious reader devouring many novels, this might actually matter to me. But as it stands, I&#x27;m the sort of person to be into a single novel at a time, and I don&#x27;t make it a point to read fast but rather to read more slowly and enjoy every word. At the same time, there&#x27;s a strange pleasure in assembling little shelves of novels I&#x27;ve read and loved. A Kindle or iBooks library just feels sterile and corporate in comparison.<p>(2) They&#x27;re searchable. For novels, this is not as much of an advantage as I thought it would be, though. The senses of touch and sight are surprisingly powerful at forming a mental index of a novel. Even small things like the passing memory of the relative difference in weight or thickness between the pages on the left and the pages on the right go into helping me remember where a particular passage was. Holding a physical novel in your hands, there&#x27;s a sense of seeing the entire book all at once, almost like a limited form of omniscience.

I&#x27;m just relaying the fact that, on the platforms where Go and Rust support FFI, they do so by implementing the C ABI, which is a stable ABI defined in the platform documentation, and the C++ ABI tends not to be well-defined or stable and is also much more complex to implement. This isn&#x27;t a criticism of C++, just a fact. (And there are good things about this; for instance, C++&#x27;s type system is so much more useful than C&#x27;s.)",1453734154

This loads an awful lot of meaning onto things that most code assumes doesn&#x27;t have meaning, like struct field order. It looks really clever in isolation but if you start playing multiple tricks like this in one code base they&#x27;ll start conflicting.<p>For example, note how you now can&#x27;t use encoding/json on these objects as currently written. Now, that&#x27;s fixable... well... it&#x27;s <i>probably</i> fixable. AFAIK the struct tagging system isn&#x27;t actually specified, so, for instance, if you try to put a tag<p><pre><code>    regex:&quot;[^\&quot;]+&quot;,json:&quot;quotefree&quot;\n</code></pre>\nthere&#x27;s no guarantee how anything will parse that. Should that backslash be there to get the &quot;character class of everything but double-quote&quot;? Will the regex code get the backslash? Will encoding/json see a field &#x27;regex:&quot;[^\&quot;&#x27; and a field &#x27;]+&quot;,json:&quot;quotefree&quot;&#x27; and then fail because there&#x27;s only a field named &#x27;]+&quot;,json&#x27; and not one named &#x27;json&#x27;? Will you encounter one of those situations where the backslash is simultaneously required and not required? Beats me. Plus I don&#x27;t guarantee stability on whatever the answer is between versions, nor do I guarantee it if you reverse the order of the two things, nor do I guarantee it if you try to add a third struct tag.<p>I would suggest taking this code and converting it into a function<p><pre><code>    UnmarshalRegex(*regexp.Regexp, val interface{}) error\n</code></pre>\nwith no use of struct tags, because you get 80-125% of the value, while dodging all the previous problems. I&#x27;d go ahead and say the user of the code is responsible for proper grouping, just describe how it needs to be, and check it at runtime.

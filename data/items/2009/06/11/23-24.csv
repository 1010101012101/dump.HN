Maybe we hit a sweet spot with Money 2004 but we never saw a compelling reason to upgrade. I have an uncle who similarly is currently using Quicken from something rediculous, like 1999. The value of the records now, the ability to look back at how various changes (births, moves, Katrina, etc) affected our savings and spending has been unbelievably helpful not only in terms of making informed decisions about the future, but also preventing fights about finances.<p>As an aside, the other major source of friction has historically revolved around schedules, and Google Calendar is awesome for that.

Download was as fast as iTunes or Steam or any other respectable online download service.<p>I made the decision to do that after downloading the first part of it for free on the Pirate Bay.<p>It was the first time I bought music fair and square in about 10 years.",1204728921

I always thought of games as art, but some of these games take it to a new level. Another example: <a href=""http://www.10gnomes.com/02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.10gnomes.com/02.html</a><p>I'd say there is more artistic motivation than traditional gameplay in that game (photography).",1204728764

If something like this takes you from being say in the top 20% of places to work to the top 2%, then you can be a lot choosier about who you hire.",1204728736

129696,comment,129517,129666,0,0,wheels,,,"Some people are wired to do art.  They have to to be happy.  If you're one of those people, by all means, do art.  But it sounds like what you're debating here is not doing art vs. not doing art, but taking art as a career path.<p>All that I'm saying is I don't expect you'd gain much by swapping out a tech day job for an arts day (or night) job.  It's still going to be the thing that's paying the bills to help you support what you're really into.<p>We're awake about 112 hours a week.  Even with a full time job that leaves more hours than most people can be productive in arts endeavors.<p>This isn't, ""Well, goofing around on stage is fine as a hobby..."" blather.  Go full on.  Set goals.  Get in a community.  Produce stuff and find a place to exhibit it.<p>But if the guys in the Blue Man Group (or similar) are doing artistic stuff they're really excited about, it probably isn't the Blue Man Group.  :-)",1204727948

If I could get the startup I have in mind going ... which I'm trying to do, just having difficulty finding available tech talent ... hint hint ... I'd have mandatory random blocks of individual ""Go out and walk around Central Park for a few hours and distract your conscious mind while your subconscious mind calculates solutions"" time and random blocks of group ""Go out to Starbucks, get some fresh air and discuss projects outside the office for a change of pace."" time.<p>Also weekly company movie viewings - either outings if something good is playing or good 'ol Netflix.<p>Our first movie would be Office Space, as a friendly reminder of why starting your own thing is the best thing to do in life.",1204727392

129687,comment,129517,129517,0,0,edw519,,,"I went through the exact same thing 2 years ago.  I was so sick of sitting in a cubicle and wanted to try stand-up comedy.  Every one I knew encouraged me, so like a typical hacker, I set up a project to get educated and find out what it would take.  Either a career change, or just part-time to break up the monotony.<p>Here's what I learned:<p>The reality is far different from what it appears to be.  Instead of nights full of laughter and fun, it would probably be monotonous nights of the same thing over and over, except for 10% of the money I make now, if that.<p>Most stand-up comics barely scrape by, spend a lot of time in their cars, a lot of late nights in the bar, and eat a lot of fast food.  They do the same 5, 10, 30, or 60 minute routine night after night, while they work their way up the ladder from ""opener"" to ""feature"" to ""headliner"".  Every one of them plays a bad room once or twice a week.  Many of them spend half their time looking for work.  And less than 1% ever really ""make it"" and less than 1% of those ""make it big"", no matter how good they are.<p>No thanks.<p>Then I redirected my thinking to figure out how to take what I currently did and make it something I'd love.  Pretty straight forward solution to that: my startup.  And I'll save the laughs for friend and family get togethers.<p>Don't mean to scare you.  You SHOULD do what you love.  But you should also get a clear idea of what it'll be like before you flick the switch.  Sometimes, the grass is NOT greener on the other side.",1204726228

If I was a VC I'd think any entrepreneur who thinks he has an advantage hiring a firm that I've kept on retainer for a decade is a complete moron.  I recall a certain Silicon Valley law firm with the usual ""beyond reproach"" ... ""our reputions are the foundation of our business"" stuff ... which at the end of the dot-com boom got into tons of lawsuits when it was discovered that despite ""client confidentiality"" the partners would pass along information of new startup clients to VCs they knew that invested in competitors.",1204726196

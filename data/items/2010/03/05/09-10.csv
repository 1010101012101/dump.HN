1169122,comment,1168568,1168568,0,0,sandGorgon,,,"It is hard to think straight when one is out of a job and running on fumes for a couple of months - I do believe that most people will not think in terms of ""hey this VC is not good, cos he does'nt get it"".<p>Most will think in terms of ""how should I rehearse in front of the mirror, so that I knock the VC's socks off"".<p>But yes, the article is good reality check - maybe it is much more relevant on your second startup when, usually, money is relatively easier to come by.",1267782742

1169120,comment,1168331,1169077,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"livejournal really isn't in the same category as blogs. it's got a much greater community aspect. you have a friends list, and you can make entries that only people on your friends list can see. lj has threaded comments that actually work, which is untrue of most of the rest of the blogosphere. there are standalone lj communities, which blogging platforms don't have. and so on.",1267782558

While I started playing in the 80s and still have a rotting away C64 in the attic (the floppies are probably beyond rot) storing and archiving the media, to me, is just darn painful.<p>So the fact that I have an implicit backup of all my games with nill re-install headache is the killer argument for Steam.<p>I'm fully aware of the drawbacks (including the, alas remote, possibility of the service going down, but am willing to chance this for the convenience received.<p>OTOH: Ubisoft just said hello to Sony (remember the rootkit fiasko, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_rootkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_rootkit</a> ) and a couple other companies on my eternal shitlist.

1169105,comment,1168905,1168935,0,0,colonelxc,,,"Phishing attacks often come in waves or ""campaigns"", the quicker you can identify a new phishing strain, the quicker you can develop filters for it.<p>That way, maybe only 25% of the intended recipients even see a particular phishing attack before you eradicate it.  Though you probably still got owned, you have a lot less owned machines.",1267781388
1169103,comment,1167238,1167238,0,0,samlittlewood,,,"Whilst I hated clearcase as a version control system (and I mean 'fire and stakes' hate, not just 'crossO the road') - it did have one good trick up its sleeve:<p>Since the dynamic views into the source were implemented as a custom file system, they could track all the file access that went into building each object. They supplied a custom version of make that pulled that info. out to construct complete dependency descriptions. If you had the toolchain in clearcase as well, that would include all the compiler bins, libs and includes.<p>Once that info was cached, and as they had code at filesystem level, it could easily be invalidated as files were touched.<p>Another product of this mechanism was that if you tried to build something that someone else had already (all the same inputs), it would just grab it over the network. In practice this meant that the nightly build would cache the bulk of the object files.",1267781269

1169100,comment,1168289,1168472,0,0,amatos,,,"My impression is that as long as you can ignore startup time, Java in general is pretty close to C++ and definitely much faster that Python. I am surprised this would be a problem with Java and not with Python. Did anyone had the same problem with Python?",1267781023

However, even when working out a good solution I think it&#x27;s important not to get stuck. Make sure you are making some sort of progress; it&#x27;s okay that it takes time but it is not okay if someone is just moving in circles instead of inching closer to the solution. Basically if something takes &quot;too long&quot; to get working, try a different approach or come back to it at a later time to try again.

9210774,comment,9210505,9210505,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I have used BackupPC (<a href=""http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/</a>) for many years now.<p>Pros: it&#x27;s stable, supports several different transfer methods, is completely simple (and still flexible) to admin, and it&#x27;s totally reliable. It does file deduplication and compression and manages its own pool very efficiently. I&#x27;ve had it responsible for networks of 50+ systems before and it worked without any trouble. It has a sensible and reliable email notification system. It gets the basics really right, which for some reason seems to be a problem with a lot of other backup software. The documentation is good. The developer is friendly, has been working on it for over a decade now, and is easy to reach by email. There&#x27;s a quiet mailing list with some folks that have used BackupPC for Truly Large Networks and know it about as well as the developer. Version 4.0 is pretty awesome. It has saved my butt a few times and a client&#x27;s butt at least twice. Also, it&#x27;s free, assuming you have a server somewhere to run it on; it&#x27;s not a SaaS or PaaS or YaWaaS, so there&#x27;s no monthly cost.<p>Cons: it doesn&#x27;t do encrypted backups. It&#x27;s written in Perl, so that&#x27;s probably a deal breaker for some people who don&#x27;t know any better. Initial setup can be a bit of a pain, especially if you&#x27;re new to it. The web interface doesn&#x27;t use jQuery or LESS or CSS3 transitions or a lot of stock photography, so some people might find it scary-looking. It doesn&#x27;t hold your hand, you&#x27;ll have to be comfortable with the CLI every once in a while if you need to do something fancy (like, say, restore a batch of files to their original locations using a text file as input -- which I&#x27;ve done with it, btw).

I think the 10x programmer exists, and the phenomenon is primarily as you describe: you spend a long time figuring out how to do something with a lot of moving parts and hidden gotchas. You eventually track down every bug, resolve every misunderstanding, reorganize and simplify, and you remember what you learned.<p>Next time something similar arises, you blow the doors off anyone else starting from scratch. I&#x27;ve done it myself, and it has be to quite common.<p>I disagree with your point [2], though, at least in part. I would get bored, too, if all I ever did was to repeat things I had figured out years earlier, but if I put the effort into figuring out how to do something hard, I want to USE that hard-earned knowledge more than once.

It can also have negative effect under some circumstances, like some very random access patterns.

It&#x27;s very rare to find wss servers on localhost using a public dns record resolving to 127.0.0.1 and a valid ssl certificate (most people seem to think a wss server on localhost is not possible).<p>So this is bad for users. For example, it will break Dropbox&#x27;s feature which allows you to open files from within the web app in a native application such as Excel (if you have the file synced on your computer).<p>If Chrome continue with this, then apps such as Dropbox will have to implement these kinds of features using server proxies.

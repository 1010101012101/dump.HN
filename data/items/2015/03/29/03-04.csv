9283815,comment,9283440,9283660,0,0,beloch,,,"I once worked in an optics lab that had been really well planned.  Each bench had network connections and optical fiber connections that go to each bench in each room of the lab.  The idea was that you could build something in one room and send it&#x27;s output to another room just by using the right fiber port on your bench.  No need to string fiber optics along the floor and through doors!<p>Planning was undone by execution unfortunately.  The installers claimed they had worked with fiber optics before and could do a great job.  They installed the cat5 cables with such tight turns that only half of them work.  The fiber optic cables had the same tight turns, and fiber is more sensitive to bends.  The loss between benches just 4 meters apart is in excess of 30 dB!  Totally unusable for practically all experiments.",1427601384

9283809,comment,9271178,9274997,0,0,jlynn,,,"I do not think the purpose of &quot;gendered expectations&quot; is to say that all &quot;white males&quot; behave this way and that other types of people do not. It is not meant to be predictive. As you point out, many people have these traits and there is interesting research finding correlation between behavioral traits and biological factors.<p>Instead, gendered expectations is about behavior that a society/environment deem acceptable for a certain type of person. That is, it is more acceptable for a man to behave in a loud and assertive manner.<p>Your final point really rung true with me. It is a great example of how environments encourage, or even require, that type of behavior. I can recall many times that I have been in a meeting and had anxiety that I couldn&#x27;t get my point across because someone else was interrupting more effectively. And if I don&#x27;t interrupt at the right time, I get spoken over and eventually the topic moves on.<p>Know that in those environments, you&#x27;re not the only person in the room feeling that way. And for the less assertive people or those who think it is inappropriate to interrupt others, they get even less opportunities to speak up. It seems like that is the status quo for so many discussions and I have to wonder, is there a better way?",1427601206

The implementation wrinkles there are that the hardness params have to be encoded in the digest itself, or otherwise stored alongside it.  Since implementations commonly do this anyhow, that doesn&#x27;t seem likely to pose much problem in practice (if any).  The other issues would be details around when to calculate the hardness.  On app initialization seems obvious, but you&#x27;d have to sample over some period of time to get a representative benchmark.  I worry that this could exceed administrator tolerance for how long an app can reasonably take to start up, but this doesn&#x27;t seem like a show stopper either.<p>Ultimately though, I&#x27;m not sure the factors are THAT variable.  I mean, you want to reconsider work factors as hardware advances, but I don&#x27;t think the line is so solid that running a work factor of N versus N+1 will make that much of a practical difference in the span of a few months or even a few years.  Still, with the goal of making it as hard as feasible while still being suitably performant in the context of a given system it makes sense.",1427601177

Lets take a fictional recruiter named Joe.<p>To begin with, Joe isn&#x27;t working for you; you&#x27;re Joe&#x27;s product. That answer would be enough to turn me away.<p>Where are Joe&#x27;s Interests aligned? With yours? No, Joe wants to place you in a job, at any salary. Joe&#x27;s company gets 30% of your first year&#x27;s income from the employer, and Joe himself gets a much smaller slice. Joe&#x27;s slice of $120k is similar enough to his slice of 130k that he beneifts most from placing you at any salary he can get you to accept, and then moving on to the next position.<p>Ah. So Joe&#x27;s interests must be aligned with the hiring company, right? Only to the extent that Joe needs them to hire you (or someone like you) and he needs you to last at least X months so he doesn&#x27;t get a claw back. His interests are more closely aligned with the company than yours, but ultimately its about filling seats for Joe. He wants to convince the company that each candidate is THE candidate.<p>Does this sound like a guy you want to help you find employment?<p>And finally, in the form of purely anecdotal personal experience, I&#x27;ve had recruiters flat out lie about aspects of the position. At the time I was too naive to verify facts with the employer.",1427600658

I was fortunate enough to get a full ride (all grants, no loans) to a top University, even as an international student. My parents couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for my flight here, which the University did. In a way that has allowed me to take a riskier career trajectory by quitting a 6 figure starting salary  at a top tech company after graduation within 3 months and starting a startup. So I am ever so grateful for policies like this.<p>But I wonder if universities should offer some sort of deferred payment (5 years after graduation for instance) to students instead (not a 3rd party loan). If you go to Stanford you are pretty much guaranteed a stable income when you graduate. Yes ,granted, a lot of alumni do donate without feeling the necessity to do so, but having such an option will help universities, perhaps more for those with smaller endowments &quot;recover&quot; some of the cost.<p>Universities could always make exceptions some time down the line on a case by case basis, depending on student&#x27;s current income which will vary violently even for top universities, with some students deciding to work for a non-profit while others choosing a more lucrative job, just like income tax works.<p>Again, I am really not sure, just throwing it out there.",1427600066

9283774,comment,9283440,9283440,0,0,beloch,,,"&quot;Most of us, if we do not deal in high-speed digital signalling, have a kind of &quot;DC Circuits&quot; understanding of wiring where the most important thing is simply that the wires connect the right points together.&quot;<p>An example of this is thinking that the order of wires in your crimps doesn&#x27;t matter so long as it is consistent at both ends.  This is emphatically not the case!  Each twisted pair in a cat5 cable is intended to carry a signal and it&#x27;s inverse. If you add a signal to it&#x27;s inverse you should get nothing, but if noise has skewed both signal and inverse, the result of addition will be the isolated interference you need to subtract from your signal.  Cat5 connections rely on this noise cancellation to work, as the wires used have little or no shielding. If you put wires into the wrong order so that signals are not paired with their inverses, this noise cancellation system is totally fubar&#x27;d and will likely make things worse than if there was no noise cancellation at all.  It might work over a few meters, but longer cables are almost guaranteed to fail.<p>Pick a wiring standard (568-A or 568-B) and stick to it.  If you do this, it&#x27;s pretty hard to mess up anything else so badly that your cables won&#x27;t work.  Bluejeanscables is a cable manufacturer, so they&#x27;re probably exaggerating how hard it is to make a good cable. In particular, their &quot;buy american&quot; schtick is not very applicable to cabling.  Monoprice is functionally equivalent, even if it&#x27;s from China.<p>Note: If you&#x27;re wiring your home, be sure to use plenum grade cable.  Other cables may be flammable and fire codes tend to disapprove of having flammable cords running through your home.<p>Also Note:  I am not an electrician.  I just found out the hard way by making bad cables for my home.  If you buy one $50 spool of cable, $5 of terminations, and a $20 crimp tool you&#x27;ll never have to pay for network cables again.

It&#x27;s not as granular as running individual tests in a suite for small changes, but it definitely helps cut most runs down to just a small percentage of all the tests. The ability to pants to build test suites in isolation is also pretty key since it means we can run a whole bunch of suites in parallel so in many cases the total test run time can be just the time of the longest individual suite.<p>As others have mentioned, kicking off full runs on a regular basis is important to make sure there aren&#x27;t weird cases that break and aren&#x27;t caught in this approach.",1427598598

You can use Wikipedia, even to edit articles, with JS disabled – it&#x27;s all simple HTML forms. JS just makes the experience smoother (adding buttons to help with WikiText formatting, etc).<p>Most content and shopping websites work fine without JS. You asked how do you fire off AJAX requests without JS? You don&#x27;t. You just design your app so it basically <i>works</i> as a set of HTML pages connected by hyperlinks and form submissions. Then you add JS to enhance things.<p>> Apparently I&#x27;ve missed a whole area of web development if this is all possible with no Javascript.<p>Yes you have. When I started (~12 years ago), JS was only used for little whizzy effects here and there, not much else. Then JS started becoming more viable due to prototype and jQuery, but it was always the most flakey part of web development, and we learned to use it cautiously as an optional layer of enhancement. You couldn&#x27;t rely on it always working. It was a way to &#x27;differentiate&#x27; your site, not a serious building block.<p>Now, everything has changed, JS is everywhere and we tend to call things &#x27;apps&#x27; more than &#x27;sites&#x27;. I spend 70% of my day writing JS. I&#x27;m not sure if I agree with the JS-bashing sentiment of the article. But I do think it&#x27;s still good practice to design your app so it delivers your core content/functionality without JS. Most stuff (blogs, e-commerce, forums, etc) can be built like this. (Admittedly some things like p2p streaming apps just can&#x27;t.) Then you can use JS to enhance things, like enhancing your basic search form with as-you-type suggestions. This approach makes your codebase more structurally sound and less entangled, and makes your app more resilient.",1427598365

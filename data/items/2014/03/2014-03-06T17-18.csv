Playing around the javascript console is one of the &quot;WOAH&quot; moments I had when I was first learning to code.<p>I remember using the Facebook &quot;Like Bomb&quot; during an all nighter at the library. It was a javascript snippet that would like everything on the page and annoy all your friends. Back then, I didn&#x27;t consider myself a coder, and didn&#x27;t think for a second I&#x27;d be doing this 4 years later.<p>I also remember being on gTalk with a friend and he was really annoyed by a paywall he couldn&#x27;t get around. It was nothing more than a popup modal, so I sent him back a couple lines of javascript that got him through the paywall. I felt like a wizard.<p>The JS console is like peeling back a layer of the web and seeing a whole new world.

7355349,comment,7353767,7353767,10,0,spotman,,,"I think its important to note that the title says <i>most</i>, and doesn&#x27;t say 100% of the time unit tests are bad.  It specifically mentions using them for critical functions/algorithms, or &#x27;units of computation&#x27;.<p>But, he outlines some of the less useful parts about it, common mistakes, and my takeaway from the article really hits spot on with some poor experiences I have had with teams that get lost in unit testing, and it really can lower the code quality and simultaneously the velocity if not approached carefully.<p>Some key quotes from the article:<p>&quot;If you find your testers splitting up functions to support the testing process, you’re destroying your system architecture and code comprehension along with it. Test at a coarser level of granularity.&quot;<p>This is all too common.  Especially with inexperienced developers.  Management requires 40, 60, 80, or 100% test coverage blindly, without thinking about whether it makes sense to test that particular part of the code, and furthermore doesn&#x27;t take into account readability, or in my experience the pain of over-abstracting something.  Little is worse when trying to debug a program, and dealing with over abstraction hell to the point where all you can read is the tests, and trying to read the source code has become entirely over complicated, all in the name of keeping the code in a format where its testable, at the cost of it being understandable.<p>Developers that have a lot of experience with system design and software architecture are in a much better place to write appropriate tests while still maintaining understandable source code, but if I had my choice between an over complicated codebase with 80% test coverage, or a more simple codebase with 0% test coverage, I would choose the simple codebase every time.<p>&quot;There’s something really sloppy about this ‘fail fast’ culture in that it encourages throwing a bunch of pasta at the wall without thinking much... in part due to an over- confidence in the level of risk mitigation that unit tests are achieving.&quot;<p>In modern development shops that do a lot of TDD, the tests are relied on way too much.  Testing of any sort is not a silver bullet.  But you find people, even in pretty big, mainstream development shops of large internet properties, relying almost solely on this.  Then they pass their &#x27;finished work&#x27; over to operations to be deployed, and when something breaks because there was not a test that counted how many file descriptors were used, the developers are always so quick to say &#x27;well, all the tests pass, so its an operations problem now&#x27;.<p>&quot;However, many supposedly agile nerds put processes and JUnit ahead of individuals and interactions.&quot;<p>In the article he comments on how someone told him that debugging isn&#x27;t what you do in front of a debugger (obviously debatable) but that its also when you&#x27;re staring at your ceiling, or discussing the inner workings of a program or algorithm with a counterpart.  This is so key, and this is why pair programming is often helpful if you get into a good rhythm with someone.  Thinking intrinsically about how software works is the take away here, and all too often we see people rely on tests as a silver bullet and the end result can be code that is over complicated, over confident, and when deployed is an operational nightmare.  These sort of things often have a giant net loss in revenue, due to the net loss in a teams velocity to ultimately produce code that works rapidly.  When developers lean on tests less (but still employ them where it counts) you&#x27;ll find easier to maintain code, written by people that will step up to the plate and be responsible for that code.<p>Obviously there are exceptions to this, and there are shops that have the right balance, and maintain high quality understandable code, while maintaining high velocity.  Personally, in over 10 years of being in this industry, almost all examples of this that I have witnessed are open source projects that are peer reviewed.",1394128518

Rationally, shrinking even a single program is &quot;shrinking government&quot;.<p>But practically &quot;shrinking government&quot; is used to mean &quot;shrinking the civilian parts of government&quot;.<p>> There is a legitimate case to be made that many people who would assert the need to shrink government in aggregate haven&#x27;t actually considered things sufficiently and would not maintain that position if they considered things program by program,<p>This reminds me of an extended conversation I had with a local county politician who ran on a &quot;shrink federal government&quot; platform. I asked him what we should shrink. There are certainly parts of the federal government I&#x27;d be in favor of shrinking or cutting. He resisted, he wouldn&#x27;t answer. I found a high level list of agencies and programs and asked him to run down the list and specify what his platform was.<p>He refused.<p>He&#x27;d get up and give a speech about the excesses of government and the deficit and all that. So I put together a list of what I&#x27;d like to see cut or what I thought would be okay to cut. I was able to provided a rough budget that cut the deficit in half and calculated out a small tax increase that would end the deficit and provide a small surplus that would simply be used to pay down the debt and then simply be returned as tax returns every year.<p>He refused.<p>Finally somebody pulled me aside and explained that he needed the support of the national party to help fund his campaign, and they hadn&#x27;t publicly specified their platform for cuts yet. So he couldn&#x27;t specify his support for specific cuts. Which meant the conversation never got beyond &quot;shrink government&quot; as a principle, but not any specifics.<p>A while later, the same national party put in place an across the board, every department gets the same cut, policy that for a while drove our news reporters to the brink of madness and was deeply deeply unpopular among much of the political spectrum.<p>So in terms of how the rhetoric &quot;shrink government&quot; gets transformed into specific policy actions, it seems that yes, cutting it across the board is not what&#x27;s intended, but the hard work of establishing a specific platform hasn&#x27;t been done yet...probably because intra-party politics means there&#x27;s no consensus of what that should actually look like.",1394128119

Many people daydream about quitting their job and owning a restaurant, mostly because they don&#x27;t understand what owning a restaurant entails. They think instead that they have fun in restaurants, so running one would be even more fun; or that they like to cook for their family, so they&#x27;d like cooking on demand under time pressure for large numbers of strangers even more; and so on. They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re getting into until they&#x27;ve sunk their life savings into it.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake, though, to assume that because these types of businesses attract dilettantes, that <i>all</i> types of businesses attract dilettantes. Once you get away from the &quot;glamor&quot; businesses, that happens much less. Nobody dreams of quitting their job and starting a waste management company; not unless they really care about waste management, at least.

If you&#x27;re lazy like me and reuse your bitcoin address for multiple transactions then yes.<p>Let&#x27;s walk through this with one of my wallet addresses.<p><a href=""https://blockchain.info/address/1PWSyqweZ7SZ8AMi9hWRtEU5Cd7PEvb9em"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/address/1PWSyqweZ7SZ8AMi9hWRtEU5Cd7P...</a><p>You can see that I sent 0.00597702 BTC to an address beginning &quot;1Jtfi&quot;. That was worth $3.99 yesterday, suggesting a USD pricing structure for that transaction.<p>In the previous transaction, you can see 0.1198 BTC ($79.49) being paid to me. You might deduce that I sold something for bitcoin, or that I bought some bitcoin from someone. Given that they came from six different addresses, you might conclude that this is probably not a direct person-to-person trade, but went through some sort of escrow or mixer. The odd USD value might suggest non-USD, but it could easily have been $80 yesterday.<p>Prior to that, I paid the same 1Jtfi address 0.0278 BTC. If you track the exchange rate back to the date of that TX, you can see it works out to $3.99 again, showing that I&#x27;m paying the same entity the same amount of money on multiple occasions.<p>Prior to that, 1AVZ paid me 0.00271878 BTC<p>Prior to that, I paid 0.0326 BTC to 1P4v.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that 1Jtfi is the cafe (it&#x27;s actually me buying reddit gold for people, hence $3.99 each time). They can look up my blockchain info (not just on blockchain.info, that&#x27;s just a convenient way of browsing it) and see the whole ledger.<p>If the cafe knows that the 1P4v address is a porn site (let&#x27;s say the porn site publish a donation address), then it&#x27;s incontrovertible.<p>Another example, try to &#x27;follow the money&#x27; on my first purchase of bitcoin: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/address/1ARvvMWkZRXcCupgJCZeiRsZxVGZRoYmTj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/address/1ARvvMWkZRXcCupgJCZeiRsZxVGZ...</a><p>In that tx, I am 12xSZ buying from 1ARvv.<p>Click the &#x27;change address&#x27; 1BTCcq (nice vanity address).<p>Now try to track the seller, guess which of the two addresses is him and which is his client. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that 1DPwh is the buyer and 1P5s1 is the same seller again.<p>Now we can basically track the smaller amounts, with the theory that the guy I bought from is selling small amount from a large stash, keep clicking the larger amount,<p>After a couple of transactions though it gets messy: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/address/1Nt1sd2ECNyjdXmQsrpzqffPS9SJV95YBG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/address/1Nt1sd2ECNyjdXmQsrpzqffPS9SJ...</a><p>Ah, now who&#x27;s our guy? Well, it&#x27;s probably the one who kept an odd number of coins (much more likely someone will buy 5 BTC than 4.86764344 BTC).<p>Now, the <i>proper</i> way to do it is for me to set up a new address for each transaction and move my funds between addresses every time I transact. That way you can&#x27;t prove whether me sending $80 to 1abcde is sending to myself or to someone else. You can&#x27;t trace the funds like we just did, because there&#x27;s no time to establish patterns. You&#x27;d also want to avoid sending BTC to an address you&#x27;ve sent to before, and avoid round numbers of BTC. And avoid transacting at timestamps with a pattern to them.<p>So, it&#x27;s theoretically capable of a decent level of anonymity. But as with most things, in practice it is susceptible to human error.<p>By the way, if you liked this comment, feel free to donate bitcoin to 1PWSyqweZ7SZ8AMi9hWRtEU5Cd7PEvb9em - maybe I can have fun tracing your transactions too :)",1394127743

You refactored for a nonsensical version of “object purity” (trying to satisfy for those metrics) instead of correctness. You claim to have tried to make a point about the design <i>and failed</i>, because your refactoring <i>at best</i> did not help readability, didn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> improve any of the metrics that Code Climate reports about, and objectively made the code perform worse in the context of how it&#x27;s called.<p>This is what happens when you refactor in a vacuum, and the danger of following tools like CC or even the “advice” given in the article at the top of this chain. I would <i>never</i> let a developer who works with me get away with the sort of refactoring attempt you did.<p>As far as your code being more complex and less readable, you have traded minor depth complexity for greater breadth complexity without simplifying the main comparison at all, and (as I keep pointing out) made the performance worse, to boot. Your code is less readable because now I&#x27;ve got some kind of comparison object that I have to instantiate—and it takes two objects called “one” and “two”. Now, when looking at your priority comparison object, I have to jump between mime/type.rb and mime/type/priority_comparison.rb to understand the data values that are being compared.<p>The reality is that the MIME::Type class is dead simple: it&#x27;s a validated data object with the self-documenting descriptive properties. MIME::Types is even simpler: it&#x27;s a container that knows how to search for its contained class. I&#x27;ve done some fairly aggressive refactoring (it just used to be two files) to extract parsing and file interaction from the main classes, and what&#x27;s left is just what&#x27;s required to interact with the data provided by a MIME::Type and to work with a MIME::Type collection (although some of it is going away because the previous on-disk data representation was too anemic, and the current on-disk data representation provides just what&#x27;s needed in a fairly efficient manner).<p>That you look at these and say “big classes!” says much more about your own biases than about the code. mime-types provides very little deep functionality, but a lot of documented and self-documented code. It just happens that the data included has a lot of attributes, and I&#x27;m a big believer in backwards compatibility. Next year, when I release mime-types 3.0, I&#x27;ll be removing the deprecated functionality—and it&#x27;ll cut the code in MIME::Type by about 35-40%, but it will still leave things that will trip up naïve complexity advice and refactorers.<p>I misspoke, though, about improvements to priority_compare: when I feel comfortable making mime-types use refinements, then I would probably make an in-place refinement of Nil to support #<=>. That probably won&#x27;t happen until 2015 or 2016, though—I have to keep supporting versions of Ruby that don&#x27;t support refinements until after the interpreter version EOLs.",1394127709

It&#x27;s a pretty intense mix of fibers and threads.<p>There are always multiple pools of actors always remaining available, and one request might use multiple pools during the course of creating its response.<p>If I don&#x27;t have many cores, a lot of time goes into actors waiting for a core to run on. This means a lot of blocking/suspended pauses. With 8 cores of significant priority, certain operations take 2 seconds that would take 11+ seconds with 4 cores, or more with 2 cores. Looking at stacktraces, the majority of that time goes into purely waiting to resume one actor until another completes a task, then looking further, that actor completing a task is just waiting to get onto a core at all. That isn&#x27;t supposed to be the case. I need to scale vertically, and I&#x27;ll end up &quot;using&quot; a lot less than if I scaled horizontally.<p>I need to get away from using a local machine, specifically my actual development &quot;console&quot; if you will, with my IDE etc, because running all my application on this local machine causes the virtual machine on my local hardware to need to schedule out tasks on its threads.<p>Because of this real need for actual cores, I can also tell when CPUs have true cores, or &quot;hybrid&quot; cores where there are really 4 cores which simulate being 8 cores.",1394127670

7355231,comment,7353767,7354967,3,0,chris_mahan,,,"I think your comment just made me understand what was nagging me about testing: writing tests is a form of decomposition. The method/function is complex/complicated, and therefore hard to reason about. The unit tests limit the scope of input so that the in particular instances, the method/function becomes more simple to reason about, enough that a test can be written.<p>Sadly, I feel there are things for which tests can&#x27;t be written. If a function takes two integers, and adds them together (the typical 2+2=4 therefore n+n=n). Does this work when the integers are near-infinity large (trillions of zeros -- theoretically possible with python)? How would a unit test validate this?<p>If you wanted to test all combinations possible, you would have to brute-force until the end of the universe, or until the machine runs out of hard drive space (or SAN space), whichever comes first. If you wanted to take a statistically significant sample, you would only have an elevated level of certainty, not an absolute level of certainty.<p>I think that what the author is pointing at is that like mathematics, which, let&#x27;s face it, the human brain is much better at than computers, programming is best done in the human brain, and that once the human brain has satisfied itself of the proper of the program, the coding becomes simple.<p>And the program no longer needs to be decomposed, because it is understood as a whole.",1394127593

You know what’s cool?”<p>Founders Fund has just raised its first $1bn fund – but Mr Parker has now officially cut his ties with the firm.<p>News of the new fund came late on Wednesday, in a deliberately low-key statement. But it’s hard to be too low-key about $1bn – or about the departure of an investor who attracts as much attention as Mr Parker.<p>It was while he was working as president at Facebook that Mr Parker introduced Mark Zuckerberg to Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, leading to the first outside investment in the company. It also led to Mr Parker and Mr Thiel working together at Founders Fund in a partnership that immediately put the firm in the Silicon Valley spotlight.<p>The most prominent – and successful – company Mr Parker has been associated with since then is Spotify, which attracted investments both from him and from the fund, and where he remains a director. But another social networking idea fell flat: Airtime, launched with a glitzy, celebrity-packed party in 2011, flopped almost immediately.<p>A spokesperson for Founders Fund tells us that Parker “has been winding down his involvement with Founders Fund over the last several years”, and adds: “He remains a friend and advisor to several members of the team, but he’ll no longer be investing on behalf of the firm.”<p>Another person close to the firm says that Mr Parker hasn’t been actively involved for several years. He told the FT himself two and a half years ago that he had “reduced his duties” at the firm to give him more time to devote to Airtime.<p>However, as of Wednesday evening, Mr Parker’s Facebook page still lists him as “executive general partner” at Founders Fund.<p>He was also still listed on the firm’s website as recently as Sunday, where he was described as part of the firm and “an entrepreneur with a record of launching genre-defining companies that reinvent ways to spread information online.” The last time it raised a fund, a little more than two years ago, he was listed as a part of “the team”, though he was not included among the partners.<p>As the FT’s Tim Bradshaw reported, Mr Parker has been spending much less time in the Silicon Valley recently. Since his controversial wedding among the California redwoods, he has been based mainly in New York, away from what he calls the Silicon Valley “monoculture”. This is what he had to say late last year:<p><pre><code>    Silicon Valley feels totally in the clouds. There is something so all-consuming about the tech world in San Francisco and it’s inescapable . . .\n</code></pre>\nIt looks like he has just taken one more step towards escaping.",1394127040

Which is often what happens right?<p>Privatization of previously government run programs is one of the example methods for doing that. I&#x27;m not interested in discussing the politics of this method, or if it is good or bad.

I bet you signed paperwork and everything and happily collected your taxpayer provided paycheck.<p>It&#x27;s actually the very definition of hypocrisy to the letter.

Flexbox is still dependent on the source order / parent-child relationships within the DOM.

Although I&#x27;ll accept this until the rest of sedentary culture reforms (not likely in this life).<p>The problem is our celebrity culture.  We turn our efforts away from the 1000s of less famous musicians around us to the handful of celebrity musicians.<p>Classical music culture, with its reverence and deification of a handful of sponsored artists, provides the template for rock music.   Hip hop culture successfully followed the template.  Jazz mainly dodged it.  Recorded media (sheet music and the record) catalyzed it.<p>Any technological aid to music culture can be judged by whether it leads to the (imo benevolent) fractioning of music - the re-directing of attention toward our immediate musicians - or whether it leverages and bolsters the celebrity culture.  Any capitalistic enterprise is blind - or farcical - to these ends and will randomly support whatever ends lead to its own survival.  However, this randomness must be biased toward existing resources, e.g. if not doing well, support the thread of celebrity culture to survive.  This pattern continues for the individual musician, too, as you point out.<p>So, from this perspective, I appreciate services which connect individuals with musicians of their choosing, but it&#x27;s not like connecting people to Primary Care Physicians, a geographically-constrained problem.  Instead, it facilitates people following their own flawed decision-making processes, following the crowds.  So it becomes an issue of individual freedom, which I adore, even though so many people will not use it optimally for themselves.",1394126064

If one request is allowed to timeout, say 5s, this reduces the effective throughput of the system to 7 threads as one is &quot;locked&quot; servicing the timed-out request.

If a single request times out, that request will cause problems, but it won&#x27;t have _nearly_ the same capacity-starving effects as the thread-bound example above; the request will simply timeout, but other requests won&#x27;t be starved because the number of in-flight concurrent requests isn&#x27;t limited by the thread/process count of the system.<p>I&#x27;m realizing as I write this that I&#x27;m straying a little off-topic here, but the point is, using process/thread-based concurrency in a high-performance system where failure is likely is a bad idea.

Assuming that using &quot;if x:&quot; is wrong (for some value of wrong) here, this issue only affects people who are using it wrong anyway. So all fixing it does is make the consequences of doing bad stuff less painful. I can&#x27;t see how that would hurt things. Even if you think &quot;if x:&quot; should <i>never</i> be used on non-booleans, leaving land mines in there to hurt newbie (or lazy) developers is not a good way to enforce that convention. It just creates pain.<p>Or more simply: whether having boolean coercion for conditionals is a good idea is orthogonal to how such a coercion should work. It sounds like Python should deprecate truthiness altogether. But it hasn&#x27;t, so in the meantime truthiness should work in a reasonable way, and falsy midnights are not reasonable.<p>Pointing out that it&#x27;s documented is unhelpful (the documentation is just the wrongness restated in a different language), as is &quot;That test does not mean what you are intending it to mean&quot; (Tautological. The OP was suggesting changing what the test means).",1394125762

My core user concern is: users losing trust in my site when they see their credit card info pre-filled but they haven&#x27;t given it to me.  Or, another site having cc info pre-filled when they only ever gave me their CC.<p>My users shouldn&#x27;t have to understand the stripe network model to not lose trust in my website.  A site knowing, or claiming to know more than it reasonably should is a sign of fraud.  In a high trust industry, you need to be very, very careful at the signals you&#x27;re sending your users.  Some of my users will get confused if they click &quot;remember me&quot; and think I stole their credit cards and sold it to other sites.<p>From a developer perspective, what really concerns me is that this decision was and is clearly being made as &quot;we&#x27;ll do what&#x27;s right for stripe and the stripe network in aggregate&quot; not &quot;we&#x27;ll do right by each merchant.&quot;  Given that you forced this into the product and then didn&#x27;t even give an opt out, how can I trust that you&#x27;re not going to make other changes?  E.G. my users now have to create a stripe.com account to use the service in the future?  Or, start heavily pushing users to pay by ACH (also something paypal has done)?  I don&#x27;t use paypal checkout because I don&#x27;t want to force my users to have paypal accounts and I don&#x27;t trust paypal because they have a long history of these kinds of decisions.<p>That people are saying &quot;that&#x27;s the way paypal would add features to the product&quot; should set off red flags and alarm bells in your CEO suite.  Right now people are suggesting stripe with the same fervor they&#x27;re telling their friends to never use paypal.  That kind of fanaticism is hard to buy, and if you lose it, impossible to get back.  Since you added this &quot;feature,&quot; I&#x27;ve stopped suggesting stripe emphatically and without reservation.  I just don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m willing to put my reputation next to your future decisions anymore.<p>This hurts, emotionally, because I trusted you guys.  And moreover, I was excited that there was finally a payments company that didn&#x27;t suck.  Now, I don&#x27;t know if I was a rube for trusting and promoting you.  The emotional process of going from excited evangelist to caution is worse than never being excited about something to begin with.<p>As a payments provider you act as our agent in the cc world.  This &quot;new feature turned on network wide (1) by default (2) without a way to turn it off (3), because we want to test it (4)&quot; makes me trust you less as an agent in 4 separate ways.<p>I didn&#x27;t opt into this, it just showed up one day with no explanation.",1394125733

I think the login/logout icons are a really nice example of this (<a href=""https://useiconic.com/icons/account/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://useiconic.com/icons/account/</a>). Many of the people complaining that there is a reliance on JS I think don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s happening here.  They&#x27;re pre-packaging baked-in methods (in this case, setState) that you can roll into your login/logout functions.  They&#x27;re even (kind of, sort of), in-lining ARIA states to make these &quot;buttons&quot; (spans, really) readily accessible.  Personally I would have taken it a step further and implemented proper ARIA button roles, but hey, it&#x27;s still new!<p>The important take away for me is that, while I will never use this, I&#x27;m excited that we&#x27;re starting to see packages that are more than just a collection of icon sets.

Perhaps it&#x27;s like BMI where it&#x27;s an approach that&#x27;s completely inappropriate for assessing an individual, but when applied to a population its shortcomings average out in a way that lets it serve as a valid statistical tool for certain purposes.<p>I think the real story here is illustrated in the contrast between that last section that you mention, and how many folks are reacting to this study:  The actual science is full of nuances and caveats which experts in the field are expected to understand, and like literally any scientific paper its results should be considered tentative unless and until it&#x27;s been corroborated by further research, including research that uses different protocols.  The public reaction, on the other hand, treats this as if it should be a cut-and-dry statement on a black-and-white issue.",1394125292

You know last week your colleague pulled over a rich white senator who was on his way home from the police union&#x27;s fundraising ball, and let him off with a caution. If you arrest the janitor your department will look like a bunch of corrupt, racist, classists. And if you don&#x27;t arrest any DUIs, all the problems caused by drunk driving will get laid at your department&#x27;s doorstep.<p>Perhaps instead of passing laws that have faults then using enforcement discretion to work around those faults, instead we should improve the laws to be fault-free. (admittedly that might need a faster release and testing cycle than we have at the moment)",1432637937

It&#x27;s illegal to fire an employee who is home sick, and people unable to work because of a burnout can stay home sick for months or even years at the employer&#x27;s expense.<p>If it happens, you try to hide it on your CV. &#x27;Stayed home taking care of children&#x27;, &#x27;Went back to college&#x27;, &#x27;Took a sabbatical&#x27;, &#x27;wanted time to travel&#x27; even a serious but purely physical illness (that was cured), all make good excuses.

Core apps should be timeless: the dialer, the keyboard, task switcher shouldn&#x27;t be slower two years after purchase.<p>- Graceful degradation. Websites have no easy way to detect how fast a device is, so they are built for the majority with a bias for the newest and fastest. The result is that cheap and old devices get obsoleted even for the simple stuff. If a $25 phone is as powerful as a 2000 computer, then let the developer feature-detect it and design for it.<p>- Good permissions. I don&#x27;t know the solution but there&#x27;s a problem. Android&#x27;s model is depressingly bad. iOS&#x27;s is too dumbed-down to be trustworthy. Firefox&#x27;s granularity is good to have but web developers seem to assume the user is always going to grant the permission. I always grunt at websites which want my position to find a store near me and display a blank page when I reject it.<p>- Timely OS updates. Firefox already has a fast release cycle regardless of the desktop OS. Why can&#x27;t mobile be the same? I believe kernel patches are less of an issue with web apps because the kernel isn&#x27;t the first line defense.<p>- Reasonably priced. The $100-200 range is already full of good Android devices. Just make deals with manufacturers to sell a Firefox version of those. They already sell dozens of different phones, so it should be feasible to convince them to add a couple identical devices with a different OS. FirefoxOS only needs one good device.<p>- Security. Better sandbox the blackboxes (drivers and radio).<p>Those were my pain points, but I&#x27;m willing to make sacrifices:<p>- 60 FPS isn&#x27;t that important for me. I care more about response time when I tap something.<p>- Most animations/transitions won&#x27;t be missed. Some add value but marginally so. Most are arbitrary and useless.<p>- Most apps won&#x27;t be missed. I only use a few.<p>Apple is margin-driven. Google is ad-driven. They already cause pain to the consumer and market dominance will only make matters worse. They also are walled gardens so they cause pain to the developer. Mozilla is indeed in a similar position to that of the 2000s.",1432636409

It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. <i></i>The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.<i></i>&quot;

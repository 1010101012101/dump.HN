In particular he is correct that &quot;Of the three non-fraudulent clinics, two show pretty elevated levels of that particularly lucrative code, the one that clips the ceiling for the fraudulent clinic.

Specifically, you could look at the aggregate trend for all four clinics year-over-year for the drug in question (the one with the spike) by seeing with your eye how the six colors move as you move your eye from Stripe A, to Stripe B, to Stripe C, to Stripe D.  Right now, with your eye you can only tell or ask about year-over-year changes for a specific drug for clinic A, not for the other ones. If all four 2009&#x27;s were peach, you could easily tell if there were 4 spikes in that year or just one.  In fact in 2009 all four do seem to spike somewhat.  Not being able to visually see aggregate year-over-year comparisons is probably the downside to the current presentation.",1434819081

9750392,comment,9747131,9747181,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"There are a few problems with this:<p>First, not everyone who goes to an elite university can get a job on Wall Street. Though these jobs are largely populated by graduates of elite universities, they are still very hard to get.<p>Second, people are more efficacious at things they want to be doing. Many people don&#x27;t want to be in a high pressure job with long work hours and are more satisfied doing work that they find personally meaningful, rather than meaningful because of all the nice ways they can spend money on others.<p>Third, implicit in your response is the idea that there is some moral imperative to act as selflessly as possible. Why? No one chose to be born, so why does the accident of their birth impel them to act a certain way? Further, it is not even clear to me that improving human life is that important. Humans are petty. We are mean to each other, we harm the environment, etc. Different people value different things. You seem to value improving others lives materially. Others have different values and priorities, and that is fine as well.<p>Fourth, peoples lives have higher order consequences than just their immediate actions. Someone can touch a lot of lives through the money they spend but they may not have as much impact as a nurse who sits down with her patients and their families and comforts them when they&#x27;re scared. Or the barber that I go to who always makes my entire day better (and thus my interactions with others better) by how cheerful he is.",1434818951

If the master branch is rewritten into a new branch, feature branches on it would need to be rebased normally.<p>Yes. The way we currently do things is keeping things as simple as possible for everyone, even if this doesn&#x27;t produce the prettiest history. A developer first creates their feature branch based off of master, commits several times to this feature branch, tests it and possibly asks for review from a coworker and then they merge this feature branch into master using --no-ff, always creating a merge commit.<p>It&#x27;s possible there have been commits to master since they based off of it. If so, they will resolve this in the merge. I do think it would be better if feature branches got rebased prior to merging onto master so they can be tested in this state as well but this is currently not how things are done (it is not up to me). Though that could create issues if there&#x27;s multiple developers collaborating on a feature branch and they do not communicate properly.<p>The reason I said &quot;every developer gets to&quot; is that in larger projects (which also usually use gerrit, which do not) I&#x27;ve seen that there are usually a select few people in charge of merging the feature branches into master, instead of everyone getting to merge as they see fit.<p>My view on rewriting history is that it should not happen on shared branches as this will surely lead to issues where one of the developers does not do the entire &#x27;fetch rebase merge&#x27; dance correctly, or works directly on master. We also contract some work out to external agencies and their git usage is usually absymal, and I am not in the position to correct or influence any of that.<p>> I think tags with descriptions would serve the same purpose. Do you see issues with that?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the tags with descriptions would help with easily rolling back all the changes introduced through a feature branch, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something.",1434818251

The same article can be written about the prison unions in California and many other states.  It is also a major lobby affecting legislation and not many people talk about it.  Their advocacy of jail time is just as bad as private companies.  Both have a profit motive in the number of people that are in prison.  Both benefit from laws that DO NOT allow alternate treatment.  This is very predictable since both groups profit from the number of people in jail.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t really see legislators changing the conditions so the profit motive for both groups will be something other than number of people currently in jail.  So, both groups: unions and private companies, will continue to lobby for laws that are not fair.<p>My own suggestion is to pay based on capacity and not occupancy with a penalty (stick) or bonus payment (carrot) for individuals released from jail that do / do not commit another offense for at least 5 years.<p>On a second note, all these debtors >> prison schemes should be illegal.",1434818064

Mechanization allowed farms to become more productive with fewer workers and in part led to the industrial revolution by creating a large labour pool that could be exploited by other industries both by eliminating existing jobs as well as by increasing the population.  That process resulted in a loss of livelihood for a large portion of the population.  The transition was largely to other forms of manual labour, mostly in manufacturing.  This didn&#x27;t happen smoothly, a notable example being the Swing Riots[1] in Britain.<p>To support your point, if we suffer a similar disruption in employment where the largest occupations start an irreversible downward trend, what sector is going to take up this burden?  If you look at the statistics for the current largest employers[2] you&#x27;ll see a list of jobs where automation has already made significant inroads.  To name the three largest:<p>* Retail salesperson<p>* Cashiers<p>* Food preparation and service workers<p>I doubt that the other large employers on the list could absorb these workers.  We just don&#x27;t have that other large employer to take up the slack as when manufacturing absorbed and made use of former farm labourers.  We also don&#x27;t have the frontier of a new world to provide a second start for families seeking a better future.

No need to sprinkle write barriers all over the place, localized and isolated mutable references (you can modify the update semantics and track them easily), minimal pause times, parallel collection, etc.<p>I think there are other interesting things you could do, for example Clojure is pretty static for a dynamically typed language and protocols map nicely to traits I wonder if you could somehow remove the dynamic typing and just have compile time type inference figure out the types (requiring explicit types when the system can&#x27;t infer the types) - this would allow you to send Clojure down to LLVM along with Rust. Or maybe you could have an interpreter for the truly dynamic stuff - but then you&#x27;d need to figure out how to export metadata.<p>Also I&#x27;m sure that the only sane/safe way to do it would be to restrict the kinds of objects and that would require serious thinking too.",1434817361

If the master branch is rewritten into a new branch, feature branches on it would need to be rebased normally.<p>Is there a reason that you&#x27;re saying &quot;every developer gets to&quot;? Normally they&#x27;d only need to rebase when they wish to integrate it back into master anyhow, which is likely to be conflict-free if they didn&#x27;t rely on the feature, and also likely to be conflict-free if they wait until you&#x27;ve re-added the feature in a fixed state. And if they decide to rebase before you re-add it, then they&#x27;d have to deal with those conflicts exactly the same as if they&#x27;d merge before your revert-revert.<p>Do your developers do the SVN thing of continually merging master into their feature branch? Typically that is a bad habit which should be replaced with rebases of the feature branch.<p>Why do you care if history gets rewritten? Because you fear it would create more work, or because you consider history inviolable.<p>> we actually appreciate there being a mark in the revision history about this.<p>I think tags with descriptions would serve the same purpose.

9750297,comment,9749393,9750242,0,0,omegaham,,,"> If a prisoner is raped, the prison should incur liability, civil and criminal for allowing it to happen. When guards initiate violence against prisoners they should be liable as well. This should be the case for both private and &quot;public&quot; prisons.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem - you can have safe, large-scale, and cheap incarceration. Pick two.<p>You can have safe, large-scale incarceration by sticking everyone in solitary and never letting them out of their cells, after all, but I doubt many people would consider that to be acceptable.<p>If you want to treat prisoners with dignity and respect, you have to pay for it. The current model is the result of budget cuts upon budget cuts upon budget cuts coupled with vastly increased &quot;demand&quot; created by the War on Drugs. When you&#x27;re incarcerating everyone for having a dime bag of weed, you&#x27;re running a Walmart-style prison instead of a focused rehabilitation facility. If we, at the very least, decriminalized possession and only went after dealers, prisons would immediately improve. Fewer prisoners means safer conditions.<p>> Frankly, this alone proves that government cannot be trusted with the business of distributing justice. Which is why I&#x27;m an anarchist.<p>I see this as misguided. Yes, the government sucks at distributing justice. But I don&#x27;t see the <i>absence</i> of government doing any better. You&#x27;d effectively end up with mob rule, which is typically governed by the biggest asshole. At least with democracy, the asshole has to keep the electorate somewhat happy. The very first thing that people did after settling the American frontier was to set up government to deal with justice.

I can speak from experience. I had a one-year probation sentence, on the very last day with only a few hours until my probation was set to expire (I even had a preliminary release letter from my probation officer with the date and time of expiration and had completed my final assessments), I was packing a moving truck preparing to move out of the state. I did not intend, nor was there any possible way I could have finished packing and had everything wrapped up in that time, to leave prior to my probation being expired. Instead an off-duty sheriff deputy who knew I was on probation just happened to see me packing decided he was going to stop and arrest me for on a violation for attempting to violate by moving. Although when I went before the judge 24 hours later he dropped it, the fact of the matter is that I was still violated, spent 24 hours in a holding cell waiting to see the judge, all because someone was a little overzealous in their job and had a zero-tolerance attitude.<p>Now I see and hear the stories every day of individuals who are violated for the dumbest reasons (i.e. bus crash in front of probation office, witnessed by probation officer, individual taken to hospital, violated for missing probation appointment by same officer that witnessed the accident in the first place. Given a 90-day sentence for violating their probation. And those were the facts as provided by the officer, not the individual. The officer essentially was laughing at how much control they have over someone&#x27;s life in these incidents.).",1434816482

Another good source on how much (or how little) to take most neuroscience hype seriously is the book <i>Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience</i> by Sally Satel adn Scott O. Lilienfeld.[1] Eventually, someday, as the article kindly submitted here for discussion suggests, there will be some actionable knowledge for daily life derived from neuroscience studies, but meanwhile the hype far exceeds the reality. As the article points out, &quot;Paul Fletcher, professor of health neuroscience at Cambridge University, explains that this is the major obstacle for progress in the field. &#x27;Nobody has a credible idea of how brain processes produce mental processes, or even a vocabulary with which to articulate such an idea, should it suddenly come to them in the bath,&#x27; he says. &#x27;Good science is usually about linking levels of description: showing how an observation at one level – say, the genetic – ultimately manifests in a physiological process or behaviour or symptom through a series of intermediary facts each expressed at intervening levels… We just don&#x27;t have these linkages in brain-mind science; it&#x27;s like the brain observations are made in one language and the mind observations in another, and there is no clue how to translate between those languages.&#x27;&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-Seductive-Appeal-Mindless-Neuroscience/dp/0465062911"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-Seductive-Appeal-Mindless-...</a>",1434816328

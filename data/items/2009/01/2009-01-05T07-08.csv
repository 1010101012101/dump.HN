Basically unless you are a founder, equity should <i>not</i> be a factor in deciding whether to join a startup. Do it because you believe in the mission, do it because you want the experience, whatever. Not that a 5-figure cheque isn't nice, mind. I paid off all my student debt and did some traveling when a dotcom IPO'd (same dotcom paid me nearly as much as a severance package about a year later). But don't count on retiring even if everything goes perfectly.",1231141647

420133,comment,419288,419569,0,0,david927,,,"> I think the US is much too large in terms of people, GDP, and land area to be efficiently governed by one entity.<p>I've felt that way for a while now.  People need to feel they have sovereignty, so ""states"" should never get too large.  Also, as Taleb said in The Black Swan about mergers: the lower diversity means that when one fails, it's catastrophic.  Instead of 300 million people trying to decide on Red or Blue, we could have 50 states that catered to every style, much as in Europe.",1231140699

From now on I will have FEWER, SMALLER, and BETTER things.<p>This usually applies to gadgets, such as my laptop but also subscriptions etc: I aim to have as few recurring payments as possible. This includes avoiding to own a car (Hello Zipcar) and mortgage (not that I can afford it at this point, but still). I can recommend everyone to do a cleanup in that area every now and then.<p>I live in NYC and managed to get a little office within walking distance so I can be ""subway independent"".

EC2 may have simplified a little more eventually, but it was also even more expensive and difficult for me to learn up front.<p>As for a custom EC2, it's really the other way around; EC2 is a custom Xen setup.

420111,comment,419360,419360,0,0,leelin,,,"Ah, but the algorithm only optimizes queue'ing up the plane cabin, when in fact we should optimize the entire queue + dequeue.<p>I only skimmed the PDF, but I think it overlooks one side benefit from loading a plane back-to-front as airlines do today: Your carry-on bag is very likely to end up near you or in front of you, even on a very packed flight.<p>The benefit is, when getting off the plane, which is always done front-to-back (and is probably optimal or close to it), everyone can grab their carry-on on their way down the aisle.  If your carry-on ever ends up BEHIND your seat in the aisle, then generally you must wait until EVERYONE else gets off (it happened to me once, and that's when I suddenly realized why each flight has people who seem ready to go but must wait patiently for the entire aisle to clear).<p>With the proposed algorithm in the PDF, if you are in an odd-numbered aisle seat, you might just have to go all the way to the back to find spare carry-on space, which is a great disaster for the deplaning part.  Why is there space in the back?  Because when people book their seats, my personal observation shows they tend to pick the back last... I guess they don't want to be near the bathrooms.",1231139412

making people like you happy.  I&#x27;ve got customers I need to take care of, Haskell doesn&#x27;t
help.  I&#x27;ve got employees I need to take care of, Haskell doesn&#x27;t help (we are weird in that 
we&#x27;ve been around for 15 years and most of my guys are still here, we&#x27;re all getting
old and when you get old all that clever shit starts to look like stuff you can&#x27;t 
support).<p>We recently added some pretty complex stuff to BitKeeper, basically a file system
and a VM system.  For a frigging source management system.  In user space.  Life is hard
enough in C, you want to toss Haskell into that mix?  Really?  Come interview with us and

Having used the next gen controllers at PAX, it&#x27;s going to very hard to be as good at they are at being a controller.<p>Valve&#x27;s controller does seem to be a good 1/2 step for mouse/keyboard replacement, eg very good accuracy, but maybe not the best of all worlds. Also able to do controller based games but not quite as good as a real controller.<p>to me it&#x27;s a sign that they hope to help developers support console versions by making a control system that will work well for games designed for mouse and keyboard, if not as well as a mouse and keyboard. But to be honest, standard controllers on games not designed for them are quite bad. Moving a &quot;mouse&quot; pointer replacement with a controller is not good. So I think it will be good in that regard. It&#x27;ll also be better than a keyboard and have MUCH better support than a logitech controller for games that want controllers.<p>So I see it as a good middle ground. And I think this will allow game devs to support both more easily. It&#x27;s not the tactic I would take to make games work on both, but I think it&#x27;s a good approach even if it isn&#x27;t going to be the best of either world.<p>However, if it IS as good as the next gen console controllers and it does better than them at mouse/keyboard then it&#x27;s a big win.",1381546267

What level of proof should CBP agents need to decide this?<p>What other potential criminals should be searched? Someone that appears to be intending to reside or work in the US despite not obtaining a visa? Can they search their belongings to help determine their intent? Or should they just close down the visa waiver program entirely and force everyone to clear positively before coming to the US, so that border agents have an easier time?<p>Really the only plausible thing I find is that for things like strip searching, a supervisor should need to agree that the person poses a smuggling or other threat that a strip search is likely to prevent.<p>But either way, it&#x27;s far more complicated than &quot;this behaviour is always unacceptable&quot;.",1381545123

6537005,comment,6532322,6536829,4,0,pcwalton,,,"> compilation speed is not as impressive. To me this is imho the biggest pain point with C++, bigger then memory unsafety.<p>Compilation speed remains a work in progress; it&#x27;s improved a lot in recent versions. Note that 80% of the compilation time in rustc is actually in LLVM passes (the same used by clang), which are mostly optimizations, so turning off optimization helps Rust compile times a lot. LLVM as a backend does many more optimizations than DMD (and 6g/8g for that matter) and runs slower as a result.<p>One issue is that Rust currently does not do incremental compilation below the crate level, so you will need to use many crates if you want incremental compilation. This will possibly change at some point via a ccache-like mechanism.<p>If memory safety is not important to your applications, though, then Rust may indeed not be the right choice. Rust requires you to make sacrifices (a learning curve and less flexible unique pointers) to ensure memory safety, and if you just want to write &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; then Rust isn&#x27;t going to be the best language for you. (That said, I think there is a strong argument to be made that for many classes of programs it is worth some pain to eliminate memory safety problems, because memory safety issues frequently lead to security vulnerabilities. For us as browser manufacturers, memory safety is so important it is worth sacrificing literally everything else except maybe performance in some cases.)<p>> - I missed templates based on any value/symbol, it forced macros on me in my very first try. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem once you know Rust, but having to write macros was too intimidating for a newb.<p>In general you want to use traits instead of macros to write generic functions. There are some current limitations with traits but I think they&#x27;re a more scalable approach than ad-hoc templates. It&#x27;d be helpful to know exactly what limitations you were hitting.",1381545046

This guy was a student traveling around the US, meeting people and writing about it. This is education, not work, and he had a student visa.<p>He just got a different education than he was expecting.",1381543274

Sure they might have been later to the market but pushing features out first doesn&#x27;t mean you will win. I understand the anger and I absolutely think it&#x27;s unethical but something like this will happen as long as the other party is untrustworthy. Situations like this are like a hand of poker sometimes you have all the information you need and you can move all in confidently, while sometimes you don&#x27;t and you have to gamble a bit. You were understandably angry because you lost.",1381543268

This was only the case if you used zero-page memory without indexing, however, so you couldn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff in RAM without incurring more speed penalties.<p><a href=""http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html</a><p>(Zero-page memory on the 6502 was the memory accessed via addresses with a high byte of 0x00. Since 6502 had sixteen-bit RAM addressing, this meant each page was 256 bytes large, so the zero-page was almost as good as having 256 single-byte registers.)",1381543265

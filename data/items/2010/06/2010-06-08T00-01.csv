You keep implying, directly and indirectly, that clients can do this by hand. People keep telling you, no they can't. When I give a specific and unintuitive reason why people can't manually verify your code in a browser, you throw out a smokescreen about how Javascript is a fine language to write things in, which of course has nothing to do with the issue at hand.<p>(<i>By the way, thing you don't want to hear from the guy offering you super-secure communication system? ""You have a superstitious paranoia about Javascript"".</i>)<p>And, as Steve Weis took the time to point out, even if you had invented some new system by which browsers could verify the state of a Javascript interpreter fed by an app that, among other things, had until a few hours ago a bunch of obvious Javascript injection flaws, you <i>still</i> wouldn't have been secure, because you don't really understand how CTR mode works and implemented colliding nonces. (Why did you bother with CTR mode anyways?) You also don't seem to understand the relation between encryption and authentication; not having a MAC would just be an embarassing oversight if you hadn't then <i>argued</i> with Weis about why it wasn't necessary.<p>The security model behind this application is just a really bad idea, Nick. I know that's tough to hear, since you obviously put some time and effort into it, but you're going to need to zag instead of zig now and come up with something cool about this chat system <i>other</i> than the notion that it's somehow more secure than Campfire or any other https chat.",1275958282

Do you have any model societies where a small fraction of the population votes instead?<p><i>Read Amy Chua World on Fire.</i><p>Actually, I have read that book and I think you're misrepresenting Chua's thesis. Her claim was not the idea that democracy lead to political demagogues which lead to mass violence. Rather it was the combination of demagogues and the presence of market dominant ethnic minorities combined that lead to mass violence. I mean, one of her main examples is Rwanda, which was a dictatorship at the time. Not exactly a haven for democracy, eh?<p><i>If you look at historical transitions from aristocracy/monarchy to democracy, you'll see that in the vast majority of cases introducing universal suffrage elections has inflamed ethnic tensions and lead to corruption, jingoism, and violence.</i><p>Um, I might believe that if you could point me to an academic citation. I will agree with you on this: rapid introduction of voting into previously autocratic societies often ends poorly. I think the takeaway there is that democracy involves a lot more than just voting: you need to build the rule of law and emplace a whole set of norms about how power is shared amongst dissenting groups. If you ignore all that and just impose elections immediately, then yeah, things can go very badly.",1275957938

If you are just interested in running a small business and to serve a small section of the society you could still become wealthy, no? And the Web 2.0 (and the accompanying lower barrier of entry) brings perfect opportunities to follow this scheme. I know at least one friend who has a regular income from the App store following this model. But he is not a millionaire by any means.

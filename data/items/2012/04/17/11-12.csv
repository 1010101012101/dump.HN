Do people get more clicks on this site when the attack one company and not another? Yeah, I am a fanboy, but still...<p>People have to remember that the App Store has nothing to do with ""Freedom of Speech"". Every retail outlet decides what products they wish to sell. They all have buyers that decide which products will compliment or negatively impact their reputation.<p>I do believe Apple owes the makers of IKamasutra an explanation, even if it is short, like: ""Company A provided us sufficient information to warrant removal of your software"", or ""Updates to your software made it too explicit and violates the App Store guidelines"". It guess its just too costly to do this or something. This does suck for someone that has had something out there for a long time and now its gone. Perhaps it wasn't another company, and the reviewer just thought ""Not another one"" and that was it.<p>I haven't searched, but I wonder how many of these apps are in there? Even the App Store (TM) guidelines mentions Kama Sutra apps:<p>""Apps that duplicate apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra apps.""<p>The other funny thing is that the next statements also says:<p>""If your app is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.""<p>So, I suppose you screw yourself by blogging and telling everyone. Biting that hand that feeds isn't always a good thing.<p>But, there is also this:<p>'Apps containing pornographic material, defined by Webster's Dictionary as ""explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings"", will be rejected'<p>So, perhaps getting closer to actual people and not the original crude wood carvings is an issue.

The fact that aethr and so many other people bring up the drastic step of renunciation should have told you right off the bat that this is not a matter of ""$50 and 2 hours"" learning Turbotax.<p>The issue is not the tax owed (which as you correctly note tends to come out near zero) but the reporting requirements, which go well beyond those imposed on people who live in the US and keep all their assets there. Turbotax and other consumer software packages do not (and likely never will) support the kinds of complex forms you have to file if you <i>settle</i> outside the US and start leading a normal financial life like any other resident of your adopted homeland: Form 8621 if you'd like to buy ETFs on your local stock exchange, Form 3520 if you're obligated to participate in a local retirement plan --- and most relevantly to Hacker News, Form 5471/8858 (and maybe a 926 and 8832 as well) if you'd like to start your own company where you live. Estimated time for completion for Form 5471 for example is 44 hours (plus a recordkeeping burden of 130 hours, primarily due to the part where you have to redo all your company's accounts in US GAAP), and it has a failure-to-file fine of tens of thousands of dollars per accounting period.<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5471.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5471.pdf</a><p>All of these forms (except Form 8938 & FBAR) must be filed regardless of the tax owed or the value of the asset in question. These forms (and their associated failure-to-file penalties) were designed with extremely rich onshore people in mind --- because Congress didn't think anyone besides a multi-millionaire tax-evader would use a ""Controlled Foreign Corporation"", ""Passive Foreign Investment Company"", or ""Foreign Non-Grantor Trust"". But as it turns out, the way the rules are written, literally every American who lives abroad for more than a few years ends up in a similar boat as American homelanders with more than 100x their income/assets, and has to pay accordingly for tax advice --- not advice on how to reduce their taxes (since once taxes in the country of residence are taken into account, there is already no tax owed), but advice on how to properly report to the IRS.",1334662405

Applying guidelines like the ones Apple uses, requires a <i>very skilled</i> individual that is able to evaluate at the same time a set of rules in a flexible way, and really understand if the app is good for the apple store or not. You can do that if you have a team of 20. Finding 300 people doing this work very well is going to be very hard, and you need to pay more as this must be people that at the same time understand design, programming (if you read the rules thare are many that without understanding of software are hard to apply), and at the same time able to find a good balance between flexibility and severity. Not an easy task at all.<p>Maybe they could improve the process with the following schema:<p>* Instead of doing a single longer review, a few of your approval team will review the app briefly, and provide a score between 1 and 5 of ""acceptability"".<p>* If the score is 4 or 5, go forward. If the score is <= 3 send it to a more expert reviewer that will do an in depth analysis.<p>Optionally also discard the app if the average score is <= 1.5 if there are problems with the ""load"" of the experts.",1334661702

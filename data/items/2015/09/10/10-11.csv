The feature also allows to pre-load assets in the background.<p>So if the developers do the right job, then that first 200 MB download contains everything for the player to start playing. Then, before those initial assets &quot;run out&quot;, the additional stuff will already have been loaded in the background.<p>Yes. This is going to be difficult for developers, but it&#x27;s also a valuable skill to be gained because it helps developers to keep their assets organized and their code will be better at dealing with streaming resources, which, in turn will open the doors for many interesting things to do in the future.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens - after all, when you consider a disk size of 32 or 64 GB, then obviously the current limit is purely artificial.<p>If developers are unable to adapt to the restrictions or if the framework isn&#x27;t good enough to the point where the end-user experience suffers, then we&#x27;ll either see the restrictions lifted or the framework improved.<p>These restrictions don&#x27;t restrict the type of game you can make, they only make it harder compared to a unlimited initial distribution.<p>(note however that if the initial download must fit in 200 MB, then the customer experience potentially <i>improves</i> as the time to download 200 MB is naturally much shorter than the time required to download 20GB which is the maximum size an app can currently have).",1441882043

There is a huge difference[0] between Node as a JS environment for writing applications and Netscape&#x27;s SSJS as an environment for writing &quot;server pages&quot;.<p>Node is for writing small standalone services. Netscape&#x27;s SSJS was for creating dynamic web pages -- just like CGI scripts or (at the time) PHP.<p>SSJS may be considered prior art for &quot;JS on the server&quot; but it&#x27;s barely recognizable. As far as I can tell the execution was entirely synchronous; but Node is defined by its evented -- and therefore asynchronous -- I/O. It&#x27;s <i>a</i> data point for comparison but it&#x27;s not a good lesson to learn from, other than what not to do.<p>A lot of the shortcomings of Node come from the limitations of JS at the time. Callbacks and streams (arguably two of the biggest issues with Node) are a result of Node being asynchronous. At the time, event listeners and callbacks were the best tool JS offered and the best thing the JS community had.<p>I can only imagine you&#x27;re trying to say that Node should have taken more inspiration from other languages that solve problems better (like gradual typing, or the Maybe monad or the actor model). But none of this has anything to do with Netscape&#x27;s SSJS.<p>You explicitly point out Netscape&#x27;s SSJS as a part of history Node should have learned from. What specifically do you think Node should have learned from it?

As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve been there couple of times and that is the path of The Professional (learning things on your own skin). Here are couple of my own remarks:<p>1) You are good dev and teamplayer, as other respected you, just that other guy steal the day somehow. Who knows, maybe he is someone closer to CEO or he managed to sell himself really good (CEOs often think like this: this new guy is expensive, have shiny CV, hence it is good. BMW is expensive and shiny, hence BMW is a good car).<p>2) I&#x27;m sorry you used the word f* during the talk, but it&#x27;s not bad, this is your first real work after all. To be honest, your destiny has been determined long time ago when CEO started to look for alternative, so no matter how polite, honest or hard working you were, you would get fired at some point.<p>3) As others mentioned here, don&#x27;t beg for work. Make your profile/blog looking professional, remove that post we all read here and write about Rails tricks you learn on daily basis. Write about it in weekly or bi-weekly span. Use blog to write about life, your kids and family (under different tag), so recruiters can see how positive you are (also CEOs and recruiters looooove devs with family as they can be easily locked within the company).<p>4) Start your own small business. You do have experience with plastics plants, go to your previous employer and ask to create a web page or a management tool for him. Offer it for free or a small fee; offer free support. You will see that people will start calling you after some time.<p>Be patient and the work will come. And good luck!",1441881753

Is it OK if one of your finished pieces is pretty awful? What about 3 in a row? One of the problems with art is that it&#x27;s an incredibly stressful field to work in professionally because of the level of competition and the perceived standards. If you&#x27;re not completely OK with sucking from time to time, it&#x27;ll be a hell of a drag on you.<p>3) Are you releasing your art? Are you getting feedback on it? Making stuff into a vacuum is draining. If at all possible, try to release it. Also, are you working on concepts for other people and projects, or just doing practise stuff?

One caver described being in cave as getting back to womb and coming out of Earth as re-born just like baby comes out squeezing in through birth canal. My own experiences are varied depending on caves. Caves are some of the very rare places where you can feel completely utterly almost impossibly disconnected from rest of the world. BTW, I&#x27;m not talking about those commercial gigantic caves, I&#x27;m talking about those little holes on Earth that are unknown outside caving communities such as NSS and local grottos. I can say that caving is likely one of 5 most important things I got in to. A very important part of caving is the people (you never go caving alone!). Mountaineering folks are typically very introverts but cavers are just some of the wildest awesome bunch out there. Look up organizations called &quot;grottos&quot; in your state or country and go out on beginners trip.",1441880237

He never responded (or somehow I never saw a response).<p>Here is a snip from the first email:<p>Begin ---%<------------%<---------------------------------<p>As I understand it, the algorithm, expressed in Python is:<p><pre><code>    #########################\n    import sys\n    from string import ascii_uppercase as alphabet\n    #         ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n    LETTER = &quot;31415926535897932384626433&quot;\n    NUMBER = [0,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9]\n\n    def f(ch):\n        assert ch in (alphabet + &quot;0123456789&quot;)\n        if ch in alphabet:\n            return int(LETTER[alphabet.index(ch)])\n        if ch in &quot;0123456789&quot;:\n            return int(ch)\n\n    def g(n):\n        return NUMBER[(NUMBER.index(n) + 1) % 10]\n\n    def pw(s):\n        digit = g((f(s[0]) + f(s[-1])) % 10)\n        result = [digit]\n        for c in s[1:]:\n            digit = g((digit + f(c)) % 10)\n            result.append(digit)\n        return result\n\n    print(sys.argv[1], pw(sys.argv[1]))\n    #########################\n</code></pre>\nConsider a few results from encryption and what it presents to the adversary:<p><pre><code>    pw(“ABC”)     == 928\n    pw(“ABCABC”)  == 928362\n</code></pre>\nIf “ABC” is a seed to the algorithm, then any seed that shares a prefix and a final character will have information leaked, sometimes enough to reveal the entire generated password for a different seed.<p>It’s actually worse than this.  For example, if the adversary knows that:<p><pre><code>    pw(“AAT”)  == 941\n    pw(“ABC”)  == 928\n    pw(“BBC”)  == 717\n</code></pre>\nthen the adversary knows that the mapping from the character C to an integer is the same as the mapping from character T.  Using the terminology presented in the lecture this is<p><pre><code>    f(“C”) == f(“T”)\n</code></pre>\nand from this adversary can determine information about the result of the password algorithm on other seeds.<p><pre><code>    pw(“BBT”)  == 717\n    pw(“B.*T”) == 7.*\n</code></pre>\nBecause the algorithm uses a recurrence that generates one ciphertext character from the result of preceding  ciphertext character, the adversary can make further inferences:<p><pre><code>    pw(“BAT”)  == 728\n</code></pre>\nwhich implies that if the preceding ciphertext is 7 and the current seed character is A that the resulting ciphertext will be 2.  Consider<p><pre><code>    pw(“BAT”)   == 728\n    pw(“XAB”)   == 725\n    pw(“XAAB”)  == 7271\n    pw(“XAAAB”) == 72725\n</code></pre>\nEnd ---%<------------%<---------------------------------<p>My second email on Sept 30, 2014 contained the solution to a challenge he proposed in the video of a lecture on the method he gave:<p>Begin ---%<------------%<---------------------------------<p>On one slide during your recent lecture, you present a bit of a challenge, and I noticed that by making use of just the four plaintext/ciphertext pairs:<p><pre><code>    BRAIN -> 06076\n    TRAIN -> 27732\n    GRAIN -> 35618\n    DRAIN -> 54349\n</code></pre>\nOne can conclude that the permutation of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] that controls the mapping g() must be one of the cycles:<p><pre><code>    6159073428  \n    8106279354  <- this turns out to be the one\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, with a bit more work one can deduce that it is the second by making use of the additional plaintext/ciphertext pair (which appears on the same slide):<p><pre><code>    AND -> 496\n</code></pre>\nSo now we know that<p><pre><code>    g(0) -> 6\n    g(1) -> 0\n    g(2) -> 7\n    g(3) -> 5\n    g(4) -> 8\n    g(5) -> 0\n    g(6) -> 2\n    g(7) -> 9\n    g(8) -> 1\n    g(9) -> 3\n</code></pre>\nWith g() in hand, it is short work to build up the mapping of f().  For these five words, the letters involved are A, B, D, G, I, N, R, and T.<p><pre><code>    f(A) -> 5\n    f(B) -> 8\n    f(D) -> 0\n    f(G) -> 6\n    f(I) -> 2\n    f(N) -> 3\n    f(R) -> 0\n    f(T) -> 0\n</code></pre>\nNotes on decryption\n===================<p>The details of this decryption aren&#x27;t very interesting, so I won’t go into detail.  I didn&#x27;t need to use a computer, just paper and pencil.  The important observation was that from BRAIN -> 06076 one knows<p>g(0 + f(R)) -> 6<p>and from TRAIN -> 27732 one knows<p>g(2 + f(R)) -> 7<p>thus if g(k) -> 6, g(k+2) -> 7.<p>This means that map(g, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) is some rotation of the list [_,_,_,_6,_,7,_,_,_,_] where 6 and 7 are at two locations apart.<p>Every letter, say &#x27;A&#x27;, which appears in more than two places in any of the plaintext/ciphertext pairs reveals information about g().  So BRAIN -> 06076\nand TRAIN -> 27732 also reveals that<p>g(6 + f(A)) -> 0  and  g(7 + f(A)) -> 7<p>Therefore, if g(k) -> 0 then g(k+1) -> 7.  Thus, we can now conclude that map(g, [0,...,9]) is some rotation of [_,_,_,_,6,0,7,_,_,_].<p>In this fashion I concluded that map(g,[0,...,9]) was some rotation of\n[2,9,1,3,6,0,7,5,8,4].  I knew that g()&#x27;s corresponding permutation was a circular permutation with a single cycle because that was a part of the system that makes it easier to memorize.<p>In general, of course, there could be ten possible mappings, one for each rotation.  However, in practice some of these rotations\nwon&#x27;t produce a permutation with a single cycle.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem because ten possible mappings for g() are still easy to validate in the next phase where we derive the mapping f().  In this particular case, there were only two possible circular permutations making it easy to decrypt the system with just paper and pencil.<p>The next step is to try out each of the possible g()&#x27;s determined above on the plaintext/ciphertext pairs.  For example, BRAIN -> 06076 implies that<p>g(0 + f(R)) = 6<p>applying the inverse map of g() to both sides<p>0 + f(R) = 0<p>so<p>f(R) -> 0<p>In this manner the entire decryption can be performed.<p>End ---%<------------%<---------------------------------",1441879860

The closest thing in Node I can think of is ES4 (which failed, resulting in a jump to 5 and ActionScript diverging further).<p>Node stalled in pre-1.0 land with what was effectively a feature freeze before io.js split off and jumped to 1.0. Io then went on a regular release schedule strictly following semver leading to 2.0 and then 3.0. These aren&#x27;t backwards incompatible in the sense that PHP 5 is to 4 or Python 3 is to 2 -- most code will likely still work; they mostly propagated breaking changes caused by updates to the underlying V8 engine, breaking some native extensions. The &quot;jump&quot; from 0.12 to 4.0 for Node is because instead of merging io.js back into Node, Node 0.12 was merged into io.js and io.js became the new Node 4.",1441879293

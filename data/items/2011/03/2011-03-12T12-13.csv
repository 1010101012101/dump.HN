Ditto - only possible in very selective environments, zero chance of being able to provide significant power generation outside of very limited circumstances.<p>There simply <i>isn't</i> a better technology out there right now. Until fusion comes along, nuclear is the best we've got. Nobody here is claiming it isn't without its risks, but it sure beats the pants off of what we're doing right now.<p>Even if we <i>completely</i> ignore the environmental angle, the social angle, and the economic angle, and consider these choices <i>purely</i> on how much radiation exposure they will subject people to, nuclear <i>still</i> wins. That's how far apart these options are. You are choosing between an extremely low chance of being exposed to a potentially damaging dose of radiation... or a <i>guarantee</i> of breathing down radiogenic material for your entire lifetime.<p>Anti-nuclear paranoia has been one of the most insidious and evil things to infect our collective consciousness in the past decades. It has enforced a continued and <i>growing</i> reliance on depleting fossil fuels, which has not only damaged the environment via greenhouse gas emissions, but pumped <i>gigatons</i> of radioactive material into the atmosphere to be inhaled by everyone. It has caused wars and famine and anti-science paranoia (did you know that the MRI was first called the NMRI? Guess why they had to rename it?).",1299931255

A lot of docs are taught NOT to use this kind of device in the room. Even burying your nose in the patient's chart, of course, is problematic. Using it outside may have its advantages, but in the room it's ideally two humans and not much between them.<p>And if you'll forgive me, I have a hard time believing an app like this will drive pad adoption by physicians. Most docs have pads because, well, they just like toys.<p>Some docs have used laptops, which are a lot easier for data entry than these pads, and these don't require turning away from the patient either. In my experience, it's not common for physicians to write their progress notes in the room with the patient. Certainly writing a prescription and sending that to a pharmacy directly makes sense in the room, but there are classes of prescriptions where that cannot be done. Looking up drug interactions may be useful, but dedicated applications like eProcrates and other dedicated apps probably have become standard for that and I'm not sure I'd trust an ""everything and the kitchen sink"" app like this more than dedicated solutions (eg, these drug interaction databases require constant updating and care).<p>Billing info and medical data combined on a view is a no-go, if that's there. They don't belong together. Period.<p>Probably most importantly, most of us would need details about security of the transmission and storage of medical records before considering this at all. Someone said below this app is ""HIPAA compliant"", but I'm leery of that overused phrase because the HIPAA requirements are quite vague, and as far as I know there is no actual certification for something like HIPAA compliance. Vague claims of ""HIPAA compliance"" are likely NOT going to impress or satisfy juries and medical licensing boards. In addition, some information (depending on the state) requires more stringent care; for example, mental health records, record of drug abuse/dependence, etc. Hospitals and clinics typically have dedicated IT departments who put into place much more security than HIPAA requires. If someone hacks a system like this, the fact that you require passwords and do some encryption is not going to cut it if you can't demonstrate you are using standard of practice medical record security measures.<p>Specifically, many physicians would want to know, at a minimum, complete details for:<p>- backup, recovery, and retention policies for all data.<p>- logging mechanisms in place to track access and change of data. By ""access"" tracking, I mean a record of every last living creature who <i>views</i> the data, at any time, for any reason, and that includes everyone at ""DrChrono"", the employees of any firms that manage their servers, etc.<p>- audit mechanisms and schedules.<p>- policies Yet Another Third Party (""DrChrono"") would have in response to subpoenas, direct request from patients for their medical records, requests from insurance companies, etc.",1298507023

However, such a solution already exists. And built by Dragon Dictation too, coincidentally.<p>It's a very efficient solution for doctors in case #2. They can just dictate their patient notes to an audio recorder, and the software is intelligent enough to sort it out appropriately, with perhaps 80-90% accuracy. However, for patient records, you need to have it at 100% accuracy, otherwise you could face medical malpractice. So the current products require doctors to review their notes on a confirmation screen on their handheld tablet devices (yup, it's on a tablet device much like an iPad). The result? Most busy doctors just hit SUBMIT without reviewing their notes, and their 80-90% accurate patient notes get recorded.

That <i>can</i> mean that products consumers have paid good money for can effectively just be switched off arbitrarily, and that's why I don't personally buy things that are DRM'd in such a way.<p>Developing for mobile platforms can be similarly risky. For example, my startup has no current plans to build an iPhone app, even though our users might appreciate it. We simply don't trust that Apple will not just arbitrarily squish us and not even notice/care based on their track record to date, and we would rather invest our money in safe platforms like the web. Apple aren't going to stop shipping a browser that can view modern web sites, it would kill their products.",1298506364

Try a google scholar search just to get an idea of the volume of research. A simple technique to test how idiomatic a phrase is would be a Bayesian type test to see how many times ""Treasure Island"" occurs in a corpus divided by how many times ""Treasure X"" and ""X Island"" occurs. In this case the capitalization probably cues it to look up Treasure Island in Freebase. Interesting thought actually - do the contestants also get the question as text? I think they do, so they get capitalization.<p>(2)I would be pretty sure these are not Java methods, I'd say they are logical predicates representing the fact that 'Treasure Island' is returned as being a member of the set of things indicated by the predicate, as returned either by syntactic processing (island) or from the knowledge bases (WordNet, Yago, Freebase, dbpedia)<p>(3) there isn't a worked example in the paper, but my idea of this is that it's basically Watson's way of figuring out what queries to type into it's unstructured text corpus (they have a corpus of web snippets indexed with lucene)",1298505918

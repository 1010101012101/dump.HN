4681113,comment,4680824,4680824,9,0,luke_s,,,"Another 30yo with 2 kids reporting in - Unfortunately I don't think that there are any easy answers. Sure you can tweak your schedule (work on the train!) and there are always a few things you can cut (Turn off the TV!).  However increasingly I'm accept two things:<p>1 - Whatever is happening, just go with it.  Sometimes the kids are going to be sick, or its a great day for playing, or your in a super productive space with your business.  I've found that I really just need to allow myself permission to do what needs doing at the moment, without feeling guilty about what I had planned to be doing.<p>2 - All those super important things you HAVE to finish.  It probably won't matter if they don't get done.  E-mails left un-answered.  Dishes left in the sink.  After a few years of this, I'm starting to realise that the world doesn't actually come to a screaming halt.  I think the true trick is realising what is really important and what you can leave out for later.<p>It's funny but I think having kids has taught me these two things, which should apply very well to the startup world.  It's kind of ironic that the 'stereotypical' startup founder is young, without kids.  There are a lot of lessons to be learnt from children, and I think the maturity that has come with having kids has been a great help for me.",1350860345

One plausible concern about adopting ""universal care"" in the US is that it will make a bad situation worse, even further insulating patients from the cost of the care provided to them and thus making it more likely that we waste effort on extremely expensive procedures that don't do any good.<p>Now, certainly one might IMAGINE putting rules in place such that this didn't happen, but that doesn't mean such rules will get put in place or will actually work as intended given our generally messed-up political process.",1350860214

4681107,comment,4680796,4681038,2,0,guylhem,,,"It's easy :<p>- I eat all my vegetables raw: apple, lettuce, tomatoes, red pepper... The only ""non fresh"" vegetables I buy (for convenience - can't find it raw where I live) is frozen broccoli which is perfectly unfrozen in the microwave, not steamed.<p>- besides vegetables, I mostly eat rice, eggs, fish and meat. Rice provides some glucids - and it cooks quite well in a microwave.<p>Fish is also easy to cook in a microwave - I loved boiled salmon with pastas, olive oil and goat cheese, but now most of the time I prefer canned mackerels because they come with a variety of sauces so I don't have to prepare them.<p>For meat, I've had decent result with frozen ""cheap"" (high fat) ground beef. I put it in a bowl- it releases grease when it's cooking in the microwave in a way that make it tasty to me (and the grease is left at the bottom of the bowl so it's easy to remove). It's not quite like boiled meat - closer to what a hamburger meat taste, and it's quick to prepare.<p>I know it's a weird diet.<p>In fact, I came to this diet not by any specific health concern but by time optimization. I like my meals to be quick and easy to prepare - if they need more than 6 minutes to prepare, I'm not interested. Cooking stuff takes time (heat transfer, etc), so most of the ""cooking"" was removed.<p>I then made my diet healthier, tweaking here and there (a bag of pop corn is quick to prepare, but maybe not that healthy) following various ideas. This caused some interesting changes - like raw eggs.<p>At the moment, I still keep the 6 minutes maximum limit every day, while eating was is generally considered healthy -  basically it's a raw diet with varied vegetables each week, only with rice and meat being cooked. I add canned oily fish + frozen broccoli for the convenience, and I still do a bag of popcorn time to time.",1350860116

4681091,comment,4679505,4680894,1,0,mistercow,,,">Whenever you connect to a P2P system you are advertising your IP address publically, so it requires no conspiracy to get them and certainly no violation of privacy.<p>I'm not sure what your point is. Content holders have mostly stopped suing people, and the generally accepted reason for this is that it wasn't profitable to do so. My point is that it looks an awful lot like this program is the result of an effort to make that process profitable again, in which case we can expect the lawsuit engine to crank back up. If you'll recall, that engine ended up screwing over a lot of innocent people last time it was running, so you should be against that happening even if you think suing illegal filesharers is a good thing in principle.<p>Nobody's talking about a ""conspiracy"" in anything but the most pedantic and technical sense. What I'm talking about is simple dishonesty, which is something we have come to expect from the likes of the MPAA and RIAA.<p>As for the violation of privacy, that's a trickier subject, but not one that is important to my point. An open home WiFi with unsecured servers on it is advertised publicly too, but if you go and poke around someone's PC, you're still violating their privacy. IPs are exchanged on p2p services for the sake of communication, not identification. So pretending to be an ordinary peer so that you can find someone's identity (i.e. through a subpoena) is arguably a violation of their privacy (although obviously not an illegal one). Again though, this is a tangent that isn't really important to my point.<p>>They want to educate customers about not running open wireless networks etc so they find it more difficult to argue ""oh, my wifi was open so it wasn't me"".<p>As far as I know, that defense has never even been attempted in a copyright case in the US, and nobody really thinks it would work if it were. It has been used in a child pornography case, and the courts didn't go for it.<p>But even if that <i>were</i> the point, why would they need <i>six</i> strikes to tell you to close your WiFi?",1350859651

4681082,comment,4679756,4679756,13,0,tolmasky,,,"EDIT: I put this same description into the stackoverflow page with an image which might help visualize it.<p>I think one way to think about this is from a combinatorics viewpoint: how many possible combinations of sorted number orderings are there? If we give the combination 0,0,0,....,0 the code 0, and 0,0,0,...,1 the code 1, and 99999999, 99999999, ... 99999999 the code N, what is N? In other words, how big is the result space?<p>Well, one way to think about this is noticing that this is a bijection of the problem of finding the number of monotonic paths in an N x M grid, where N = 1,000,000 and M = 100,000,000. In other words, if you have a grid that is 1,000,000 wide and 100,000,000 tall, how many shortest paths from the bottom left to the top right are there? Shortest paths of course require you only ever either move right or up (if you were to move down or left you would be undoing previously accomplished progress). To see how this is a bijection of our number sorting problem, observe the following:<p>You can imagine any horizontal leg in our path as a number in our ordering, where the Y location of the leg represents the value (image: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aJp4b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/aJp4b.png</a> ). So if the path simply moves to the right all the way to the end, then jumps all the way to the top, that is equivalent to the ordering 0,0,0,...,0. if it instead begins by jumping all the way to the top and then moves to the right 1,000,000 times, that is equivalent to 99999999,99999999,..., 99999999. A path where it moves right once, then up once, then right one, then up once, etc to the very end (then necessarily jumps all the way to the top), is equivalent to 0,1,2,3,...,999999.<p>Luckily for us this problem has already been solved, such a grid has (N + M) Choose (M) paths:<p>(1,000,000 + 100,000,000) Choose (100,000,000) ~= 2.27 * 10^2436455<p>N thus equals 2.27 * 10^2436455, and so the code 0 represents 0,0,0,...,0 and the code 2.27 * 10^2436455 and some change represents 99999999,99999999,..., 99999999.<p>In order to store all the numbers from 0 to 2.27 * 10^2436455 you need lg2 (2.27 * 10^2436455) = 8.0937 * 10^6 bits.<p>1 megabyte = 8388608 bits > 8093700 bits<p>So it appears that we at least actually have enough room to store the result! Now of course the interesting bit is doing the sorting as the numbers stream in. Not sure the best approach to this is given we have 294908 bits remaining. I imagine an interesting technique would be to at each point assume that that is is the entire ordering, finding the code for that ordering, and then as you receive a new number going back and updating the previous code.

If I am blind, would you require me to listen to ads before my text reader started browsing the site? If I had difficulty seeing, would you prevent my browser from scaling the text so that I could see it better even if it ruined your layout? If I were busy, would it be a crime to have my secretary read relevant parts to me over the phone?<p>It's clear. I, and only I, control how I consume your content <i>once you make it available</i>.

Besides that, it is also pretty trivial to spoof a MAC address.<p>> For Dropbox, it's probably better to reduce the friction in the sign up flow than to prevent against these kinds of edge cases.<p>Agreed. But there are smarter ways to do it. Take Gmail for example - it normally doesn't require you to pass a captcha. But if you fail a certain number of login attempts, it does. How hard can it be to start displaying a captcha after, say, 5 accounts get registered within 24 hours for the same IP address?",1350858842

Any large departure from the current iPad will likely be a different product.

For us participating in HN from outside the USA, it is baffling to see guys that can be so involved and intelligent on some issues (he is Creative Director at row27) and at the same time so openly aggressive and irrational on others. And yes, sorry, but it is irrational to say that this is not HN material, but actively participate in other political threads when they are about some political victories of your own political party (as he did for example in ""Senate votes to repeal 1099 reporting requirement in health care law""). And BTW, as we always have to sadly explain, this would be the same if he is not republican but democrat or whatever. Some of us just really dislike double standards. And flagging this story because it makes your Military and government look bad, and excusing yourself in ""not HN"", well...",1350856926

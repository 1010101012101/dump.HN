191021,comment,190824,190855,0,0,nostrademons,,,"90% (actually, about 98%) of American drivers <i>are</i> above average, owing to a statistical quirk.  There are 6 million car accidents in the U.S. each year, out of roughly 240 million vehicles.  At a minimum, that means that 97.5% of drivers get in <i>no</i> accidents that year.  They join the big bulge of people who are ""average"", having perfect driving records or only an accident a decade or so.<p>Accident frequency is a power law distribution - a large percentage of crashes are caused by a small number of drivers who habitually violate traffic laws, drive drunk, or otherwise engage in risky behavior.  One of the distinctive features of power law distributions is that there's this long tail of people with very small values, and then a few people who make up most of the curve.  So (made up numbers) you might have 60% of the population who has <i>never</i> gotten in an accident, then 35% who has gotten in one, then a tiny fraction of 1% who's been in a dozen.  Over an 80 year lifetime, that 6 million accidents/year results in 480 million accidents, or 2/person, so with the hypothetical percentages above, 95% of people are above the mean and 60% are above the median.<p>Just goes to show that you can't assume everything is a Gaussian. ;-)<p>A similar phenomenom occurs in many, many other fields.  The average (median) wage-earner actually makes below average (mean) wages, because the existence of Bill Gates and Carl Icahn skews the distribution upwards.  The median sale price for a startup is $0, because over half of them fail.  The average test scores in Palo Alto or Weston, MA or Hunter College High School really <i>are</i> above average, because those places already preselect for bright kids.  It's quite possible for Lake Wobegone to exist: you just need to compare <i>your</i> kids with <i>someone else's</i> average.<p>And none of this invalidates SSB, but you picked a bad example to illustrate it.  When 90% of drivers think they're in the top 50%, they're right.",1210887914

Let's remove ourselves from finance for a minute into something that is more traditional in the game theory studies--namely poker.<p>If the game is played where the players arrange transfers face to face such as in a home poker game, then the game is zero-sum. Your losses are my gains. No money is created. No money is destroyed. It stays inside the game. The minute we go to a casino to play the same game, the game becomes sub-zero due to the rake. You lose X to me and Y to the rake. I gain your X and lose Y to the rake.<p>Your cash flows: -X - Y. My cash flows: X - Y. In a zero-sum game your cash flows are the negative of my cash flows. This implies -(-X - Y) = X + Y. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the game is not zero-sum.",1210885929

If like me, you have read a lot of the posts on this site, and the essays of Mr Graham, and have a desire to somehow start a start-up, or become your own boss etc., you search for ways to achieve this/these goals.<p>Most of the advice is fairly general, and I was often left with the feeling that many people just repeat the mantra: 'learn how to hack', 'do something you want, and users will like' etc etc.  All good advice I may say, but nothing too concrete on how you actually start!<p>As hackers, most people will say: ""you need to code, and business people, although relevant aren't required straight away.""<p>I sort of agree and disagree.  What does not work though is doing nothing, or procrastinating(in the wrong areas).<p>For me, I decided to at least do SOMETHING.  I came from a systems engineering background (read:good Microsoft/Cisco techie, and reasonable sales/presentation sort of guy) - not a hacker though.<p>So, I decided to attempt to learn Java about a year or two ago.  I have done OK with this, but unless you use a language in anger most days, you don't get very far.  My latest attempt is Python.  I like Core Python Programming 2nd edition by Wesley J. Chun.<p>What I guess I am trying to say is, you need to work out where you want to be (successful business), and take small steps towards it.  That maybe learning business stuff, and it maybe learning to hack.  Whatever.  Just do something that is a step towards where you want to be, and continually re-evaluate how it's going.<p>Good luck.",1210885412

No, I learn Django which taught me the two, plus how to build a web framework, how to do unit and functional testing, how to scale and deploy application, how to interact with organized and structural programing, and how to be the best programer I can be.<p>Learning doesn't happen step by step, it happens in a vast flow. In high school, did they teach you how to write an essay, then let you write a little English, then move onto History? No, they threw you in head-first with 6 or more classes a day, and made you face the facts.

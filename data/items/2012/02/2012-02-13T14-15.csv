3585763,comment,3585236,3585736,1,0,kiwidrew,,,"> Think about these massive Middle-Ages cathedrals done before we had Newton's Laws and modern notions of engineering. How did the architects do it? Well, they were hackers with a large budget. The architect usually had never built anything on this scale before and had no idea how their much-smaller-scale building experience would scale up. In particular, the fact that arches create sideways stresses which tend to bulge a large, open building outwards wasn't necessarily well-known by many of these architects.<p>That's a fascinating thought.

3585761,comment,3580617,3580660,1,0,CPlatypus,,,"Let's do the math on that.  60 hours is twelve hours a day, plus three more with your daughter.  Add a couple of hours for showering and dressing, food prep, and general housework.  That's seventeen hours a day, leaving seven for sleep plus <i>zero</i> for exercise, recreation, social life, career development, etc.  Oh yeah, and interaction with your wife too.  Maybe that's working out for you, but I know where it would lead for most people: physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion in only a few months.  Even if that three hours a day with your daughter is merely being in the same place but doing other things, the weekends - which you claim you spend with her as well - wouldn't be enough to recharge.<p>Of course, that's the optimistic case where you have a spouse who does many of those things you apparently don't even think about, and who is willing to accept your devotion to company above family.  In reality, that's not likely to last long and you'd be single in short order.  Some would say that proves the point about startup/family incompatibility right there, but let's say you overcome the strong anti-male bias in our family-law system and become the custodial parent so you still have a family (sans wife).  Now you'll need to spend even more time on food prep and housework, plus other tasks related to school or general care and feeding of a child.  Also, many of those tasks will need to be done at particular times, not at leisure.  Even if you slept a mere four hours a night, you'd be hard pressed to spend three hours a day of <i>real</i> time with your daughter.<p>In short, then, I just don't think your example proves your point very well at all.  Maybe you're superman, the one in a million who could sustain such a schedule.  That still says nothing about whether others can.",1329144895

I'm sitting here with a 4GB RAM machine running Arch Linux with XMonad.

Typical software written for the Mac has no external dependencies.<p>Except, they do. Many of those dependencies are built into the OS. The NS* api's and ect... Everything else they may have built their software on has to be distributed.

In a virtual memory system with on-demand paging, memory mapped I/O, shared libraries and copy on write pages even measuring and interpreting memory stats is very difficult and subtle.<p>The ""real memory"" column is resident set size, a completely useless metric for the problem at hand because of many reasons. One reason is that much of the physical pages can be shared, indeed most of them usually are, on my system a chrome process has a 120MB RSS, but after closer inspection 110MB is shared, and after even closer inspection 90MB is shared with non-chrome processes. Closing the process with top RSS usage might do very little for decreasing memory pressure. Another reason is that physical memory usage is very misleading, if the system is swapping, a process has less resident physical pages than the virtual pages it uses, that's the reason the system is swapping in the first place! A process can thrash memory and have a relatively small RSS.<p>You also simply assume what the problem is without actually testing for it. You need to look why the system spends time in kernel mode, maybe it's not swapping, most likely is not swapping in this particular case, it's more likely to be the random I/O caused on-demand paging of memory mapped things or something more subtle, like copy-on-write pages being written to. It also could be a million other things.<p>Even if the problem is caused by memory pressure, memory pressure is a remarkably generic term, the VM system has many components and different components are affected by different workloads.

The whole point of customer development as I interpret it is to GTFO of the building, find customers, build relationships with them, and start making money ASAP.<p>Maybe the OP has had experience with individuals just getting to customer engagement and then sitting on their thumbs? In that case I can understand the frustration but it seems less customer development focused and more ""why don't people want to make money"" focused.",1329142154

It sounds rather more like you were sitting on good profit margins and now you're being <i>forced</i> to compete.<p>It's becoming clearer what Google's strategy is with Google Fiber: they don't care if it makes a ton of money, what they really care is that it makes Internet access speeds in the US better, whether by providing the service directly, or pushing other providers to compete harder than they have been.<p>Faster Internet access means more Google services consumed, more time spent, more ads clicked. <i>That's</i> what Google wants.",1366934385

If they did they wouldn't let it dissolve into the hands of some humongous company like Google/Facebook et al (especially since 9 out of 10 of such acquisitions end with the product being halted).<p>Sometimes the original thing isn't even a product. It's a bunch of free stuff offered to get as many users as possible that could never stand of it's own (no monetization options) and only a acquire could save it (the buying company can then use it as a acqui-hire, to get some press and street cred, to build something else, as part of a larger, different offering, etc).",1366934336

design (buffering), but when you get into latency-critical applications, another
type of switch design is used, typically called a cross-bar switch.<p><a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220055485_A_low-latency_modular_switch_for_CMP_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220055485_A_low-late...</a><p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US5339396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US5339396</a><p>I think opinions vary on whether or not crossbar designs ""buffer"" but it

If you want to compile & test your whole project each time, then you're all good, but if you want to cut your build process down and just recompile the modules that you're working on, you're going to lose most of that time saving in trying to wrangle Maven into doing things properly. The main issue is the dependency management is all built around the idea that you only ever depend on jar files in a repository. So, in a multi-module project where you actually want to depend on ""the source code sitting in a sibling directory"", things go wrong.<p>Despite Maven's theories about having a standardised project model, too much ends up being left to the plugin authors. If you're using more esoteric plugins (e.g. the Corba IDLc plugins) then you'll get caught out by issues that the plugin authors didn't think of. <i>Plugin-X</i> looks for a resource file on the classpath (but only the <i>main</i> classpath, not the test one), <i>Plugin Y</i> looks for its resource file on the file system, <i>Plugin Z</i> will look for a file on the classpath, but crashes if that file is inside a jar, but you need to reference a jar because the file is coming from another module in your multi-module project, and you can only express dependencies on jar files. So to work around that you add a step in your build to unpack the jar into a temporary location and add that location to the classpath. And you though maven wasn't procedural.<p>One artifact per module is a nice idea thought up by people who assumed that their experiences were diverse enough to solve everyone else's problems. Unsurprisingly they're wrong. But to keep maven happy you split your project into dozens of modules each with 1 artifact. But that makes your build even slower, and creates even more issues with managing the dependencies between modules. And even if you do that, you still end up hacking your pom to create more than 1 artifact because sometimes you really need to.<p>Handling test support code in a multi-module project is painful. Well written tests need supporting code. But that is neither ""test"" code (because test code is not exported out of your module) nor ""main"" code (because you don't want to ship it). So either, you create extra modules to handle testing. In the worst case, you need to split each module into 3 - the <i>main</i> code, the <i>test support</i> code, and the actually <i>tests</i>.<p>So, in summary, the pain you're feeling with a small project, is just multiplied exponentially as your project grows.",1366932421

The average Chinese person has much less real 'wealth' than the average American, and when you hold 'wealth' equal, American's are just as likely to lie, cheat and steal, because lying cheating and stealing have little to do with morality below a certain socio-economic level. You just can't generalize a result of poverty to an entire class of people, and then try and make a comparison to another class that doesn't live in poverty.<p>And if we really want to get down to it.  Average Americans have more of their basic needs fulfilled, and so less excuses for 'degraded morality' and yet it is they, and not the 'immoral chinese' who waste more food per capita when people in their own country and the world are starving, it is they who waste more water when over a 1 billion people don't have access to clean drinking water.  It is they who through their political power and free-information ( certainly more than the average Chinese person ) choose to directly and indirectly support a government which subjugates not only millions of people directly around the world through its military empire, but also uses its preferential status as the world super-power to drive political and commercial entities in those same countries to commit terrible atrocities on their own people.  All for the sake of maintaining the lifestyle of the Average American, who is so moral. and I'm sure if the chinese were afforded the same privileged position they would behave the same as the americans.  But you do not recognize this, and feel it necessary to make a false equivalence and assert the moral superiority of one v the other. And it is this moral superiority complex that you seem to have, and which you seem to apply so liberally to Americans, but not Chinese who are evil and bad for stealing and lying and reacting to poverty, nevermind the people in poverty in the US who do the same thing, which makes your observation racist.<p>As to your selection bias for evaluating elite morality.  I would first indicate that the US has a much better and more vigilant news apparatus than China's.  And that from a US perspective you haven't been 'informed' on all the bad things the chinese gov't does to its own people.  Like how many people died as a direct result of flooding and displacement from the three gorges dam project, how many continue to die for lack of an EPA in beijing and other cities?  All people are equally corrupt, regardless of nationality or socio-economic status ( above a certain level, below which 'morality' ceases to be relevant ).  The reason why it appears the elite are more so is that their status as elite gives them much greater impact and reach than the average corrupt person.<p>I don't have a problem with you giving an opinion or observation or even stating your moral position, I have a problem with the assumptions behind it, and the moral superiority you are displaying which I believe to be racist.",1366932048

For instance, my parents were genuinely surprised to hear that I wrote written exams and submitted them only to be reviewed at face value - which is the experience of nearly all undergrads I expect. Their experience was that, even in a ""straight-forward"" subject like Mathematics, they had to first submit a written response to a problem set in an examination type settings - and then upon completion they would have to explain their solution and approach one-on-one with a faculty member who would only then submit a grade.<p>Obviously this was done to weed out the cheaters who couldn't explain why they had to correct answers to all the questions.

You haven't shown that merely doing things with a computer makes it worse.<p><i>""You need to show that prosecutors could not bring as many charges for an equivalent crime of stealing something from a safe or locked filing cabinet""
That is not equivalent. The equivalent crime would be having a friend in the office hold a door open so that you can enter and make a copy of some documents. There are two crimes there: conspiracy, and theft of trade secrets.</i><p>You're committing criminal trespass in that example, why don't you include that? And why do you equate accessing the system to simply holding a door open, as if there were no login security? I mentioned the example of documents being held in a safe as a proxy for the fact that you need to log into a system before copying documents from it, it's not like you just SSH in and get automatic access to the shell prompt for the asking. The reason that we have a crime of unauthorized access to a computer system is precisely because it's easier to get into a computer without damaging it than it is to get through a window without breaking it.<p>You're rewriting the facts to make your argument stand up. that's what's wrong with it. You do <i>not</i> get to just walk into someone else' place of business and start using the copier, and then only be charged for the copies you made, for the same reason that if you break into my house at night and take some money you're guilty of burglary as well as theft.

Each lecture <i>easily</i> takes 8 hours to prep.  6 assignments--have to make them up, set up automated tests, get things set up in source code control, and help students when things come back wrong if they can&#x27;t figure it out.  A midterm and a final--have to make it up and correct it.  Add in office hours as well as replying to students via email and I&#x27;m easily at 40 hours per week.<p>This is why so many teachers just prep once and regurgitate each class (including assignments and tests).  It&#x27;s just <i>sooooo</i> much less time consuming.<p>Don&#x27;t feel bad.  My poor TA (who was a student in a previous class I taught) was stunned too--&quot;It takes this much time?!?!?!  And you did this <i>by yourself</i> for our class?&quot;",1403344784

7924597,comment,7921445,7921445,2,0,kumarishan,,,"I think those kids wrote longer and better essays also because when typing you know you can edit, insert or remove whatever part whenever you want. This I believe also makes the person less thoughtful about what he writes for the first time. Contrary to writing, when you need to visualize the whole essay first and then start writing. Which is much more difficult. So the result, ie typing gave better result can also be because of the flexibility to modify any part of the content. What if no edits were alloyed while typing ? does that change the outcome ?<p>While writing essays or quick replies, typing can be better both because of its transcription fluency and flexibility in editing (iterative style of writing).<p>But in note taking, one needs another kind of flexibility. Like ability to change the handwriting or write in any direction anywhere. How many times we write illegible words, just to getaway with it and focus on the knowledge while in classroom. Also while pondering on an idea, we need this flexibility. We don&#x27;t get this in typing. Only if we could scribble while typing (something to solve) ....<p>Writing is certainly loosing its territory to typing. Emails replaced letters, editing softwares, etc. But IMO once touch screen computers and tablet takes over. We might see people preferring stylus pens and resort back to writing. But Graphite is still going to loose.. :)",1403344676

7924584,comment,7924282,7924558,1,0,battani,,,"I guess your argument is then about security. Your funds are as secure as whoever is holding them, whether it be in bitcoin or regular fiat through CC.<p>If you place your bitcoin on Coinbase, Bitpay, an exchange, or even on your own local wallet/cold storage, and one of these gets hacked (e.g. a hacker gets access to your private key), your funds are gone forever.<p>If you give your credit card info to a merchant and they betray your trust and charge you, you will 1) not lose your funds because you&#x27;ll just charge them back, 2) they will be blacklisted by their credit card provider if chargebacks are too high. So this incentivizes merchants to <i>not</i> charge you illegally if they want to stay in business.<p>The Target, Sony hackings were indeed unfortunate, but they are exceptions rather than the norm. And they can also be likened to the many exchanges and wallets that have been hacked in the bitcoin world. Except in the latter case, consumers could not get their money back.<p>&quot;There are many people who trade forex (like oanda.com) and gamble on sports or poker (like betfair.com) every day.

7924576,comment,7909488,7910985,1,0,relix,,,"Using regular paper ballot, you can force the voter to take a picture of his vote before he puts it in the box. It&#x27;s that simple to put pressure on someone voting by paper. Oh, you can get a new voting form after you mark and photographed the first one? The criminal can stand outside the voting booth to make sure you don&#x27;t go out and in again.<p>If you think papervoting is 100% secure you&#x27;re naive. That&#x27;s why e-voting doesn&#x27;t need to be 100% secure, it just needs to be as secure as papervoting is now. The advantage with e-voting is that you can surpass the safety of papervoting.<p>Using e-voting it&#x27;s actually much harder to put pressure on any voting. If you had read how it actually works, you&#x27;d have noticed that you&#x27;re able to verify your vote only for up to 30 minutes after placing it. You&#x27;re also able to change your vote by re-voting - the last vote counts. There still is a paperbased voting a week after e-voting ends, and if you go and vote by paper, that one overrides any electronic vote you might have made.<p>It shows a lack of respect that you try to put down a system you obviously haven&#x27;t looked into and know nothing about. You hear &quot;voting on the internet&quot; and have a knee-jerk reaction that it&#x27;s bad. Please in the future before you take a standpoint on any side of a discussion, research both sides, instead of throwing around opinions without merit. If everyone would have an informed opinion instead of just an opinion, society would be light-years ahead of where we are now.",1403343858

First you set up a wallet (with Coinbase, Bitpay, or someone else). Then you get verified. Then you purchase bitcoin, hoping to get it at a good price.<p>Then you browse the web hoping your merchant integrates with Coinbase/Bitpay. If not, they&#x27;ll display a bitcoin address, that you&#x27;ll then have to paste into your wallet, enter the correct amount, etc.<p>Even if we do argue that this will only get better, it&#x27;s not gonna get much better than tapping &quot;Buy&quot; on your mobile wallet, that&#x27;s already connected to your bank account/card. User experience is <i>not</i> an area where bitcoin adds value.<p>&quot;deal with chargebacks and replacing my card if the merchant loses my card information&quot;<p>Chargebacks are a form of consumer protection. Eliminating them benefits the merchant, at the expense of the consumer.<p>&quot;One time my bank just canceled my card without giving me any reason besides &#x27;security&#x27; and mailed me a new one. What would I have done if I were traveling at the time or needed to buy something in the meantime?&quot;<p>Yes, that sucks. But how often does that happen? How big is this problem? And is adopting bitcoin (already a huge cost: mental adjustment, buying bitcoin, etc.) really a good solution to this problem? Or is it just switching to a bank with better customer service? Simple, BOA (in my experience), etc.<p>&quot;Besides that, if you&#x27;ve ever tried doing anything online besides the straight purchase of a good or service (think forex trading, gambling, remittances) you&#x27;d agree Bitcoin is light-years ahead of the prevailing payment methods.&quot;<p>Yes, forex trading and gambling are absolutely fantastic to do with bitcoin. But this reinforces the argument that bitcoin is a speculative financial asset, rather than a currency used in day-to-day activities.<p>The remittance market is ripe for disruption, but a gateway model such as the one offered by Ripple would better fit this problem, in my opinion.",1403342377

Did QPC become better (and Sleep()/WaitForSingleObject() saner, as we&#x27;re touching time-related stuff) in XP before EOLing? Assuming having Vista+, does it really work reliably even when called from a thread bound to only one core on various (not necessarily latest) hardware? Have you played with it under VMs?<p>QPC was buggy and is still buggy for many users out there. After 15 years Microsoft is likely getting closer to sane behavior and maybe in latest Windows 8 (8.1) and Sever 2012 (2012 R2) it really works reliably in different setups and loads (haven&#x27;t tested it yet). OTOH &quot;getting better&quot; by sole die out of setups, where it was working incorrectly, is not really getting any better.<p>Viewpoint is important here. If you build your own infrastructure, you choose your HW/SW stack, can thoroughly test QPC behavior, then if it seems you go with same setup for your servers or what not [1]. But if you write software for all Windows users out there, then you don&#x27;t have that much luxury. QPC is simply not good enough. You can always try with building some logic that falls back from QPC to lower resolution functions whenever odd behavior is detected, but unless you have HW/SW instances that you could test it on, then there is (high?) possibility you won&#x27;t do it right, so maybe you shouldn&#x27;t do it in the first place?<p>1 ms resolution at best should be enough in most cases. Increasing timer interrupt frequency from default 64 Hz (15.6 ms resolution) to 1000 Hz (1 ms resolution) indeed affects system behavior and can harm battery life, but it may be necessary evil. If we&#x27;re talking about high-resolution time, then 1 ms resolution is simply that kind of thing for Windows (as ridiculous it may sound) if we take reliability into account. E.g. games, your multimedia applications and so on are already using timeBeginPeriod(1). Good news is that reportedly since Windows 8 the harm on battery is much less.<p>[1] But if you really have control over HW/SW stack for your servers, then you&#x27;ll quite likely happily avoid using Windows...",1403341365

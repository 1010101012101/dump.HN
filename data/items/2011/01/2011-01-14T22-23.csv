What about Facebook or Vimeo? I think these prove that you can have an automated encode produce acceptable results.<p>If you care enough to be picky about the parameters used to encode a given video, then you're probably not uploading that video to YouTube in the first place, which gives the end-user no control whatsoever of the encoding parameters.<p>If you publish several hundred videos on your own and you've carefully tweaked and created an encoding profile for each one and you want to use the same care when transitioning to WebM, then I recognize that that will be pretty time-consuming for you. However, I sincerely doubt that's a very common case, and, as above, you don't have to switch to WebM if you don't want to. H.264 decoders still work.",1295045931

(Until recently, Cisco used other brands for consumer products, e.g. Linksys!)  But if it’s not to reach the consumers, why do it?  Simply to “purchase” journalists and networks.  If they start criticizing Cisco for its role in oppressive regimes’ censorship and e-terror campaigns, they lose a significant percent of their ad revenue.<p>The genius of it is, the financial ramifications are so obvious to these networks & publishers that not a single explicit word needs said; it’s not a bribe, it’s just making it lucrative to keep one’s figurative mouth shut.",1295045888

Even after trying all your Git Foo. In other words, that you would now have to checkout the main trunk of the project and manually merge your changes (by backing up your failed branch with a file system copy). Yes, svn merge and svn reintegrate usually work but there are times where the entire process completely fails and makes you want to do shots at 3pm on a Monday. (Good luck if someone deleted files you have in your private branch!) You Git developers have it good. Branching is like breathing to Git, while it is like a dental checkup in SVN. I prefer Git and avoid svn branching since it is like touching a hot stove. So basically I have to keep up with the SVN trunk and I cannot merge WIP because I am not on a private branch.

...completely hate this.<p>At first read, the idea of a boss that is not yourself struck me as great because it helps give you a very different perspective on things. But having that boss simply ""make all the decisions about what you should do"" takes away all the duties of a founder. Figuring out what to do is the real hard work of a startup.

WebM is probably safer than most because you have a big entity to fight most of your battle for you, presuming such a battle ever materializes.<p>Of course it's possible that MPEG-LA will be angry to see their H.264 revenue stream run consistently drier and sue in hopes of retaliation and a declaration that all WebM users must pay MPEG-LA royalties anyway. There's no guarantee that this will happen, however, and that MPEG-LA hasn't made an attempt to ""nip this in the bud"" demonstrates that they may not be all that certain they have a case here.<p>Google released WebM explicitly to circumvent the restrictions with H.264 so I suspect they did their due diligence and deviated from the H.264 patents in the necessary ways, but as above, there's nothing you can do if you irritate a group that has money and lawyers and wants to try their hand at milking something out of you. That's a general fact of life whether you use WebM or not.<p>If you're really worried about the FUD MPEG-LA puts out to scare you into paying protection money, then I guess you are free to pay that, if it makes you feel happier. But ""Google shouldn't promote free standards because it might make someone angry and then they might sue you"" is just not a very solid argument -- we can't refuse to do anything because someone might sue us.

If they support H.264 but not WebM I'm sticking to H.264, and happily paying the relatively negligible licensing fees.<p>You also seem to be underestimating the complexity of re-encoding a video library. Its a massive and costly undertaking and hardly just taken care of with a shell script. You generally don't ""re-encode"" existing H.264 video to WebM. You re-encode baseline video at a higher bitrate down to WebM or H.264 at various bitrates. Frequently these source baseline videos are not stored as digital files - they are multi GB in size.  We work with the UFC and re-encoding their content at one point required them re-sending digital <i>tapes</i> to the encoding house so they have high quality source video.<p>Let alone the actual process.<p>Even if you own your own encoding tools you generally need to re-encode, QA the resulting video, push it all out to your CDN and then change every link you've got point to the new video URL. If you're not encoding your own video but using an existing service you frequently have to pay for both bandwidth and encoding costs to redo your video you often pay per-minute of video.

The flaw is quite simple, if you use it then it will no longer work. What, I hear you say, that doesn't sound very Apple after all their products are both beautiful and functional. I know I'm honestly as shocked as you are, I only buy Apple computers and to be honest if someone asks me what kind of computer they should buy the answer is simple, an Apple. 
So anyway here I am with an Apple MightyMouse, it looks beautiful and it works for a while but then all of a sudden the scrolly ball thing doesn't scroll in the right direction. I can scroll up, yay, but down, boo, that's not allowed and I am disappointed that my beautiful iMac is now a bit shit.<p>Oh dear something's not working, at least I have Apple's legendary customer service to fall back on (yay - possibly):<p>So I do what any sensible geek does (did I mention I'm a geek, in case you're curious I am), check the apple site and the internet in general to see what might be wrong. Yay once again it turns out this is a common problem with people who don't work in a clean room environment. Apparently if the MightyMouse is exposed to any kind of dirt/skin/life then after a while its sensitive little scrolly ball stops working. This sounds bad but it's OK you just have to turn the MightyMouse upside down and rub it forcefully against a piece of clean paper until it starts working again (I believe this is called cleaning in human circles but I imagine in the world of Apple it's called, removing the reality from perfection). My MightyMouse works again for a while ...<p>A temporary solution turns out to not be permanent:<p>Oh dear, I've used the turn upside down and rub against a clean piece of paper technique once too much. No matter how many times I try I can only scroll in one direction. Never mind I think I'll pop down to my local Apple store and they'll help (oh how I love that legendary Apple service).<p>And so off to the Apple store I go:<p>Fortunately I live in a large UK conurbation, this means my Apple store is only a few miles away. On arrival I'm greeted by a security guard, then some guy in a blue shirt appears and tries to sell me an iPhone. 'Hello there I say I've got a bit of a problem in that my mouse doesn't work' (offering the MightyMouse to him), this turns out to be an error blue shirts cannot do anything but sell oops. He backs away in fear and tells me that I must go upstairs to talk to the tech people ... It's ok I'm used to dealing with sales people so I smile and amble upstairs to shat seems to be some kind of indoctrination centre flanked by desks called 'Genius bars', seriously who the hell calls tech support geniuses, but hey if it makes them happy ...<p>I try and get someone to fix my mouse:<p>So I amble up to the nearest official looking person and explain the issue to the (mouse doesn't work seems simple to me) and they helpfully inform me that I need to talk to a genius. I'm not convinced a genius is required, after all a broken mouse is simply fixed by replacing it, but this guy seems convinced and he says that I need a pre-booked slot to talk to one of these geniuses so I ask if he could maybe fit me in, what with my problem being only a broken mouse surely it's simple replace mouse make customer happy. He is so helpful he offers to allow me onto a special genius bar waiver. I just have to wait about a half hour to talk to one.<p>I get to talk to a genius:<p>I wander around the Apple store, make some phone calls, consider buying some stuff then think better of it. After killing plenty of time my name appears on the pretty screens and some 'genius' accepts my communication. 'So what seems to be the problem', this is not what I expected from a genius but hey, I explain that my mouse doesn't work (I should point out that I've already explained this to every Apple employee I've experienced so far, as well as showing them the mouse and telling them exactly what I'd done to try and fix the problem). I explain the problem again ... he takes my MightyMouse picks up a clean piece of paper and rubs the mouse against the paper. I am shocked to observe that this doesn't fix the problem, more worryingly so is he ...<p>I try and get a replacement mouse (you know like you would with any company if the thing they'd sold you didn't work):<p>My personal genius is shocked, apparently the mouse doesn't work. I am not so shocked and ask if he can replace it, what with us being in an Apple store full of Apple goodness. Oh no says my personal genius, this is an OEM mouse, comes with the iMac you bought and we don't have any of them. hmmmmm How about the Apple MightyMouse I can see in a box just over there that you'll happily sell me? Oh no we can't possibly give you that it's not the right product says he ... I am I admit at this point a little disillusioned. I turned up with a broken mouse and thought I could just replace it, turns out that's not the Apple way.<p>I'm palmed off with the offer of an replacement:<p>So the genius can't replace my mouse, he needs to put in a special order. But I don't need to worry because their next delivery is imminent and he'll have a new mouse ready for me in a few days. I thought I just needed a new mouse, turns out I need a very specific new mouse but that's ok I'm a patient man. Apparently someone will contact me the moment my new mouse is available, then I can enjoy the Apple experience once more by returning to the shop and picking it up.<p>I wait:<p>No one calls<p>I wait some more:<p>No one calls (seriously this is two weeks after I was told I'd have the mouse in a few days)<p>I lose patience:<p>So I march to the Apple store, someone tries to sell me an iPhone and I ignore them. I find someone in an orange shirt (these seem to be the be the power brokers in Apple stores) and explain my situation (I am very annoyed). Fortunately because of Apple's legendary support I am fast tracked to a genius bar appointment. I repeat my experience in a surprisingly light hearted manner (see above) and offer the offending mouse to him. 
I am not joking when I say that his reaction was to take a piece of clean paper and rub the ball thing against the clean paper for fully thirty seconds before uttering the immortal words 'Seems like it's broken'. I didn't kill him or anyone in the near vicinity, he did however explain that they had no OEM parts available to replace my mouse. 
I explained my story so far and he, I imagine breaking company policy, gave me a new mouse. I wasn't happy but at least I had a mouse that worked.<p>I get annoying phonecalls:<p>So I have a mouse that works (for now, god knows what I'm going to do when this one fails due to the fact I don't live in a reality free zone) and all of sudden I start getting messages from my local Apple store.
'Hi mister blah we've just got your apple mouse in stock we'd love it if you could make an appointment to come and pick it up'
Argh, I have my mouse. It was a nightmare getting it and you don't even know that I've got it ...<p>I hate apple:<p>I used to love apple. Seriously I still love the hardware but the customer service sucks. I remember when apple would collect and return your laptops, now you're lucky if they spit in your face and tell you their mice are shit.<p>Seriously do I seem bitter:<p>I know it's only a mouse but for the love of god why not just replace it ....",1295043093

2105639,comment,2105154,2105570,0,0,VengefulCynic,,,"Ignoring the cost in ignoring the revenue from millions of iOS users, let me focus instead of the looming legal question of WebM.  If Google were to indemnify WebM users (sites who encode in WebM, developers who release decoders, OEMs who release hardware decoders), I would be much more willing to embrace WebM.  As is, there is a very cogent argument to be made that the MPEG-LA group has already suggested that some of their patents may be encapsulated in WebM and users could be opening themselves up to lawsuits as co-defendants with Google.  H.264 isn't free, but it's a known cost and licensing from MPEG-LA indemnifies you from any legal costs that might be associated with patent trolls popping up to sue you to death.",1295043007

We shouldn't be held back and stuck on a proprietary format just because you don't want to write a script to go through and re-encode everything to WebM.<p>H.264 heretofore has been ""the standard"", so of course most existing devices will have better support for H.264 video than for the not-even-one-year-old WebM. Google and Mozilla are attempting to change that to avoid a repeat of GIF or even MP3.<p>The argument boils down to ""I don't want to put in the effort to switch to the new stuff, and my old stuff likes the old stuff better anyway, so Google is a jerk for trying to make the old stuff less common."" And that's just a silly argument that could easily be applied to any number of things in technology, which is a very fast moving field. Things change a lot in this space and it's just one of those things you have to accept.<p>Google has not obliterated or disabled your H.264 decoders. You are welcome to keep H.264 video around all you want (according, of course, to your license terms with the MPEG-LA). Removing native support from Chrom(e|ium) does not mean that all H.264 video is now magically broken or unplayable. If you are happy with H.264, you are free to continue to use it.",1295042997

You pick your clients, negotiate rates and other details, provide your own insurance, pay your own employment taxes, your clients send you 1099s every year.<p>ghshephard is talking about workers who are typically W-2 employees of a contracting agency. The agency contracts with the &quot;employer&quot; to provide the workers. The &quot;employer&quot; pays the agency who in turn pays the workers, pays various employment taxes, sometimes provide health insurance and other basic benefits.<p>There is a third type, which selectodude in a sibling comment to this one posted about. Those are individuals working directly for a company which is abusing the term/status &quot;independent contractor&quot;. This is not terribly rare, but it is illegal, and can get the employer in trouble with the IRS and state DOL if reported, <i>especially</i> if the workers haven&#x27;t been paying the taxes themselves.",1385312351

6790092,comment,6789905,6789905,31,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Since this concerns the U.S. government, I&#x27;ll say that the vendetta against euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide by the Christian right is puzzling. The Bible has a very ambivalent view on suicide (as with any other topic), the tale of Samson being a prime example. The main argument against suicide comes from Corinthians, but it is starkly contradicted by other passages.<p>A person who is slowly succumbing, immobile, on the brink of death and suffering has nothing to offer or worthwhile to live for. Their life is effectively over and they&#x27;re simply waiting for the moment their biological functions will at last cease.<p>Yet the Christian right insists that the agony be prolonged to a maximum. The religion is notably fascinated with martyrdom, asceticism and persecution complexes. But that suffering has no purpose in overcoming tribulation when you&#x27;re a near-lifeless bag of meat. Then, of course, very few Christians actually ascribe to the ascetic life as laid down in their scripture.<p>Sorry for your loss.",1385312294

6790065,comment,6787092,6787546,3,0,evantish,,,"I&#x27;ve read almost every popular book on the subject of (pscho/socio)pathy. I think &quot;Wisdom of Psychopaths&quot; [1] would be one that you might enjoy.<p>> ...are there millions of Ted Bundys out there who never actually killed anyone and even lead productive lives?<p>I think the answer to this is probably yes-ish.  The thing about people like Ted Bundy is that he wasn&#x27;t JUST a psychopath. He was also sadistic, and probably some other characteristics [2]. The reason I say &quot;yes&quot; though is that there are certainly a lot of psychopaths (however you want to define the parameters of the definition) out there leading productive and &quot;normal&quot; lives without killing anyone.<p>Now, if I may indulge my own pet ideas...<p>Psychopaths have certainly been with us forever. Having no empathy, conscience or remorse and also being sexually promiscuous makes for a fairly effective survival and reproductive strategy outside of the modern context (see the Ghengis Khan effect [3]). On the flip side, they also probably killed each other off pretty regularly too (which would have had some possible cyclical effects). This leads one to ponder what role the psychopath might play in modernity. And it doesn&#x27;t take too long to get some unsurprising / interesting results [4][5]. I&#x27;d say that one of the features of capitalism is that it can effectively (but not perfectly) convert volatile/psychopathic personalities into value for society. Where a psychopath might have been an Attila the Hun in historical past, he might be Steve Jobs today. Of course, as someone else pointed out, he might also be Dick Cheney too. Thankfully, nations have adopted political and governing structures designed to mitigate the damage one psychopathic person can do. When I see things like extreme inequality in America I wonder what role psychopaths are playing and if perhaps we&#x27;re entering a phase where we may have to institute some enduring controls on the more emergent(?) psychopathic tendencies in our economic systems (as presaged by &quot;The Corporation&quot;?[6]). Anyway, don&#x27;t want to beat a dead horse. Suffice to say, I find it amusing (and admittedly dangerous) to view history and current events through a lens of who-are-the-likely-psychopaths.

If an employer were to hire permanent employees as &quot;contractors&quot;, courts would be likely to reject that argument.<p>Secondly, social security is structured a bit differently from the U.S. version: Contributions are taken out of employee&#x27;s salaries (and matched by the employer). Contractors would be required to act as commercial entities and contribute themselves. This would require a fair bit of paperwork -- not something you&#x27;d expect a low-wage employee to complete. And if they&#x27;d fail to complete and submit the paperwork, social security would take action against said contractors or -- more likely, imo -- against the original employer.<p>Thirdly, self-employed persons face some extra paperwork for their tax declarations. A big shift from employees to self-employed people would be noticable (and, going back to point 1, likely to be rejected by the courts).<p>By the way: the proposal included language specifically prohibiting outsourcing the <i>leadership</i> of a company to another company.",1385311910

6790058,comment,6765722,6772718,1,0,wallflower,,,"The true test of relationships are when something is at stake. It is does not matter what realm they lie in for your life. So my revised advice is to pursue relationships that go beyond superficial friendliness. The company you are working for falls in that area. You seem to be a renaissance individual with diverse interests. That is very good to hear. Be open to everything. Much of success (and its sometimes corollary -,financial success) is due to how much leadership you take on - which runs the spectrum from being a senior developer on a project to the guy (or girl) responsible for all software development projects or being your own business owner. The beauty of business is that if you start one - you will be exposed to all aspects. The flip side is working for a quasi-stable company will pigeon hole you into a slot - for that is how they operate.<p>So to answer your question - I have had many project-based relationships. When the project ended, the relationship ended. However, in a few cases, I remained friends, however loose, with a few individuals. The answer to your question is  to try to work with and be around with individuals you want to be around with. And do not let the work be the only definition for the relationship.<p>Truely extroverted connected people have multiple circles of friends with concentric circles of trust and intimacy. For example, this means, many people might want to have some of their time but they get to choose who they spend time with. And having known a few of these successful individuals (who I need to clarify are not always extroverted - but passionate for their cause), they make you feel important when you meet with them.<p>So in closing of this ramble, do not be biased who you spend time with - but make the most of it - and if you do not like each other, it is natural and ok to drift.",1385311834

I lost several other close family members who also suffered. And just last week somebody I was close to told me they were dying of cancer.<p>And I&#x27;m a libertarian that strongly believes that government should keep its nose out of my life.<p>So, of course, I&#x27;m going to play devil&#x27;s advocate, at least a bit. Because if you can&#x27;t defend the other side&#x27;s points well, you shouldn&#x27;t be in the argument.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: physician-assisted suicide is one thing if the doc gives you the pills and you take them on your own. It&#x27;s something else if the state <i>requires</i> doctors to assist you, or the state requires insurance companies to require doctors to assist you. Then we&#x27;re getting into the state telling doctors what types moral views they should hold.<p>Hey, I&#x27;m all for you shooting your cat if it&#x27;s sick. What I&#x27;m against is the community all making some collective decision about who&#x27;s got to go and when, and who has to do the work. That&#x27;s fucked up. This thing has to be a personal choice among everybody involved: docs, nurses, family, the patient. I could imagine in many cases the patient wants to whack themselves and the family hates the idea. Fine. Then let the guy do it. On his own. Or perhaps the docs have given up hope, but for religious reasons they will never pull the plug. Fine, then let the patient do it. There&#x27;s a decision to be made, somebody should make it, and the rest of society should butt out -- either from disapproving or forcing everybody else from doing things they don&#x27;t want to do.

You are also ignoring the fact that the metal coins from China were also being used as currency in neighboring countries, and so even when the Chinese government stopped minting (or banned) older currencies it took time for those currencies to fall out of circulation.  To put it another way, Chinese farmers did not decide to use copper on their own; copper was chosen by a government in certain rural regions.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not clear on what you think the difference is between using silver by weight and using silver by face value&quot;<p>The face value of a coin does not need to track the market value of the metal used to make the coin.  Typically it is advantageous for the face value to be higher than the value of the metal (otherwise people will just melt down the metal); it could happen the other way, e.g. what happened with US pennies.  &quot;Face value&quot; only makes sense with fiat currency, which is why I drew the distinction.<p>&quot;The whole idea of a mint is that coins have a standard weight&quot;<p>This is not true of modern coins; all the really matters with modern coins is their face value, which can have nothing to do with their weight.  It is not uncommon for a smaller coin to have a larger face value than a larger coin.  Relating the physical measurements of a coin with its face value is <i>convenient</i> but not at all necessary in a fiat currency.  The US has dollar coins with different weights and dimensions, all with a face value of one dollar, and the value of those coins is independent of the market value of the metals they are made from.",1385311675

My experience has been that formal understanding of theory (say of state machines) equips one to handle complex problems and in no way indicates how well the code is written. For example, a GUI application code (say) making use of a framework wouldn&#x27;t give any indication of whether the author had any formal understanding of state machines or not.

Which part of this are you not clear about?<p>> ... psychology has little to do with this.<p>Psychology has everything to do with this. Psychology&#x27;s basic premise is that there is a normal behavior, a &quot;good thing&quot;, and we should all aspire to it. Meanwhile, in reality, evolution requires diversity to function. Diversity stands at odds with the idea that there is a single correct model for behavior.<p>The important thing to understand about evolution is that it&#x27;s strongly backed by scientific evidence, unlike psychology&#x27;s belief system. One piece of evidence in favor of evolution, by no means the only piece, is us -- we arose by way of natural selection, and this happened by way of innumerable failed experiments. No natural selection, no humans. That&#x27;s strong evidence for how badly psychology pictures reality.<p>> Terminology should be used properly, and we should be aware what words mean, especially if we criticize sloppy science or health care.<p>Don&#x27;t tell me, tell the director of the NIMH and the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the country, who is arguing for the abandonment of the DSM:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-scientific-backlash-against-the-dsm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-s...</a><p>I cannot impress on you strongly enough that the present criticism of the field of psychology is entirely justified by facts.",1385309595

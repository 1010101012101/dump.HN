That doesn't make you a good scientist.<p>A good scientist is one who puts forward a testable hypothesis <i>and then tests it</i> before publishing.<p>A <i>great</i> scientist is one who creates a testable hypothesis, tests it, and then -- when the data fail to prove the hypothesis -- shrugs, publishes the definitive <i>refutation</i> of her own hypothesis, and moves on to something else. It took me years to realize just how rare a skill this is, even for scientists. Part of the problem is that the career system for scientists actively discourages this -- once you've finally managed to sell a line of research to a funding agency, there are very strong incentives to keep that research going, even if it isn't getting anywhere.",1223909683

And the question you have to ask when you see an article like this is: What's the groundwork-to-hysteria ratio? I see plenty of hysteria here, but no data. There's one cited reference to the scientific literature... but it's on a different subject.<p>There's nothing wrong with <i>hypothesizing</i> that (a) modern medical practices are leading to deficiencies in Vitamin D among certain populations and (b) Vitamin D deficiency is linked to autism. But the responsible next step is to get some good data, or at least link to some. It's not to write stuff like this:<p><i>Since the 1970's, our country has witnessed a 3000% increase in the sales of sunscreen products, alongside a 30% increase in deaths from melanoma[17]. Isn't it time to admit that sunscreen is not working?</i><p>This is a telling paragraph. It tells me that the author is prone to making mistakes straight out of Darrell Huff's <i>How to Lie With Statistics</i>: Clock A strikes midnight a few seconds before clock B; isn't it time to admit that A caused B to strike?<p>Autism seems to be one of those issues that really inspires the quack epidemiologist. When you combine it with the opportunity to lecture new mothers -- our culture's favorite vice -- the temptation becomes irresistable. But it's worth remembering that actual epidemiology is really hard. Diagnosing autism without bias is hard. Randomly sampling the population for autism is even harder. Even something relatively simple, like measuring Vitamin D levels in the blood, is tedious and expensive and difficult to do without bias. But just because anecdotes and handwaving are much easier doesn't make them more believable.",1223909064

331028,comment,330470,330470,0,0,abl,,,"Based what I've read about this startup, and on the facts presented, it is difficult to tell whether Orian or his co-founders were in the right. It would require to place all of their efforts under a microscope - we don't know how much time Orian sacrificed to go out of his way to find venture funding, etc.. versus the other partners who may have been slaving away over the code. My guess on the whole venture falling through is this - the other partners felt like they were doing more work and putting in more into it than Orian was, probably because they felt that networking is a lightweight activity.  Or because networking sounded to them like a more glamorous activity, rather than coding. Or, maybe because they felt they wanted an equal share in the leadership. Whatever the case may be, we don't know how much coding and networking took place.<p>Orian's case brings up a good question that I've dealt with in the past, and I am sure is on the minds of many startup founders here - how important is it that the co-founders are all technical, and are all coders?  Is it, ""product first, marketing second?""  Or is it equally just as important to have a strong ""networking"" guy on the team?  If so, what are his roles, just networking, or coding as well?  What about a guy who is doing the coding but feels he could do networking just as well, is it unfair to him?<p>Going back to Orian... judging based on other factors, there seems to have been some trust impediments in my opinion -  having two votes when all other things being equal is not a fair distribution, even for the sake of maintaining decision-making. Trust between partners is more important than decision making, otherwise the whole thing falls apart.<p>Rather than take apart Orian's flaws, I am trying to understand if this startup could have been saved. 
What if Orian went to his parners, and said, ""Guys, how about we all participate in the networking?"" (Assuming he did his equal share of the coding by working on the demo.) Maybe this would have generated some further excitement and instilled trust in them?  AND, it would become self-evident whether or NOT the networking efforts equaled the coding efforts. I know that some may argue this is not a good solution, because concentrating on networking would have further removed them from realizing a product, but at least it could have played a role in bringing the team back, which it sounds was their first priority. Another thing, higher visibility and transparency. If all the partners were stuck in the same office all day long, maybe this lack of trust would diminish? Maybe a regular status meeting to keep tabs on everyone's progress? What does everyone (including Orian) think, what would be possible solution in their case?",1223907821

Like when you look at a 2nd hand car listing and they leave off mileage - you know it will be huge. Transcripts, no - they just add unnecessary padding at this stage, nobody wants to read those unless they absolutely have to, so they&#x27;d only be asked for at the end of the process, if at all.<p>But more importantly than either of these - you should write your resume differently depending on what you are applying for. Highlight what is most valuable to the organization you are applying to. If this means you have to reduce the number of applications you send out, that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s much better to have fewer well targeted applications.<p>And try to state facts, not claims. By which I mean - don&#x27;t claim to &#x27;work well in a team&#x27;, or have &#x27;excellent X&#x27;. Show what you&#x27;ve done and the impact it had.

At the risk of sounding trite: it&#x27;s easy to call people complacent in the face of a tyrannical government when it isn&#x27;t your family that will be the target of that violence. Resisting a strong and deeply rooted tyrannical government is not for the feint of heart or those with precious things to lose. To say those that don&#x27;t give up the tenuous stability they have to attempt to foil the will of the government are complacent is dangerously close to shifting the blame on the victims of abuse.<p>I suppose it would be fair to say that in any tyrannical state that many are, in a way, resigned to their fate. For most people in that situation anything besides begrudging acceptance of the way things are is not far from suicide. In the case of the US I would wholeheartedly agree that apathy is a huge driving force behind our government taking power it should not.

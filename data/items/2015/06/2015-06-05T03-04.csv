I don’t recall the article saying that symbols are the only way to do this, or the best way to do this out of all the options. I recall people saying similar things about closures for a while, until it caught on that closures and lexical scope are a natural part of JavaScript.<p>TFA’s point is that ECMAScript 2015’s choice to keep classes as first-class functions with prototypes that are objects is what allows us to use all of the techniques we already have for first-class values, including returning them from functions.<p>As I keep saying, using a closure (if that’s what you want to do) demonstrates the exact same thing, it works because a method is just a function.<p>Now that we have established  that I am not claiming that symbols are better than closures, I will warn you about an edge case: When you use compact method syntax, you do get something that an ordinary function does not provide, the `super` keyword.<p>I do not know how to make that work in the case where you assign a function to an instance of an object. So if you want to override a function while calling the super-class’s implementation, it might be tricky to use the closure solution.<p>That being said... I wouldn’t stay up late worrying about it.",1433476782

I don&#x27;t use ruby, and if I did I might very well - as a PCRE half-expert - fall into this trap based purely on the assumption that ruby was using PCRE. I just looked at their Regexp class, and it matches PCRE in most regards. The fact that /m makes . match newline \n is horrible - every PCRE-based implementation uses /s for that, whereas /m only affects ^ and $.<p>It still falls on the developer to understand the exact flavor of regex available in their language. And yet ruby is doing a disservice to anybody coming to their language with existing PCRE knowledge by having syntax that is almost an exact match to PCRE used in many languages... only to find out someday that it&#x27;s not.

9663809,comment,9661954,9662557,0,0,ised,,,"&quot;The JVM has billions of dollars of engineering effort poured into it.  At the same time, it is stil out-performed by low-budget small-team efforts (e.g., LuaJIT, Inferno).&quot;<p>This seems a truism with respect to many &quot;high value&quot; software products/projects across the computing world.  The ones that attract large investment.<p>The only time I ever use Java is when I use something made by someone else who uses Java.  And when their software slows to a crawl or crashes, what can I do?  It was not my decision to use Java.  It is so pervasive, there&#x27;s Java on a SIM card, what can a user do?  Impossible to avoid.<p>But as for computers where I can open them up and install my choice of kernel and utilities, I have no need for Java.  There is not a single file of Java anywhere in my source tree.  I can find code written in terse languages that does everything I need to do with the computer.  Code that out-performs Java, easily.<p>Maybe something written by a small team or even one person. :)<p>I think that is what makes the ITC field so entertaining.  No matter how much cash and how many engineers a company can accumulate, a small team of dedicated people with little to no money, sometimes just one incredible mind sitting at a keyboard, can still create something that wins on performance.  Is that not &quot;success&quot; of some sort?<p>As for Java, I guess it depends on how one defines success.<p>I like brevity, conciseness, performance and reliablity.  Not sure I would label Java as a success under those criteria, but that is just my personal opinion as a user.<p>In terms of mindshare, Java is a tremendous success.<p>You mentioned Go.  Rob Pikes&#x27; OSCON 2010 talk introducing Go  had some criticisms of Java with examples.  I think he said Java was a symbol of bureaucracy or something to that effect.

I love the city (!) But between Federal taxes, state taxes, and city taxes, the reality is that I pay over 40% taxes. Yet, I receive none of the benefits European countries offer their citizens: state sponsored healthcare, subsidized (and good) education, etc. It&#x27;s a real shame because I think it reflects very poorly on us, as a &quot;first world&quot; society.<p>For those not from the area, a few figures to give you a sense of things:
- the truth is that public schools have a bad reputation. There are a few exceptional public schools (Stuyvesant, Hunter, Bronx Science), but they&#x27;re highly selective and certainly can&#x27;t fit every kid in the city. I know many who send their kids to private schools (>$30K or $40K per year in tuition fees)
- health insurance is tied to one&#x27;s employer, and while some is subsidized by employer), it is paid out of employee&#x27;s paycheck to a private insurance company.<p>So, yeah, taxes may be high in France, Germany, and many other countries, but there&#x27;s some return.<p>Again, I love NYC and all it has to offer. Objectively, one has to be honest about the pros and cons living here.<p>Disclaimer: I am married to a European. Perhaps I&#x27;ve been drinking the kool-aid :-)",1433476390

None of it is bloat as far as Rust is concerned. I optimize bare-metal Rust code nearly every day and if I had to spend time fixing suboptimal codegen due to missing optimization passes in the compiler I&#x27;d never get my job done. Especially since I work on ARM, where bad codegen punishes you hard.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a lot of room for improvement in Rust&#x27;s build times, but LLVM was completely indispensable for the language to get off the ground, and I don&#x27;t regret using it for a minute.",1433476357

The people they are replacing are normally cost to the company at least double that. The rate in India is normally above 20$/hr and employees get paid less than 6$/hr.

No offense to Valve but I&#x27;ll be very surprised if they can succeed in a way -- and at a lower price point -- that much more experienced controller-makers have not been able to after decades of iteration. I just hope it&#x27;s more compatible with my Mac than a jury-rigged XBOX360 controller is.",1433473456

The point is that a black box takes the kind of effort you describe to review: &quot;meaningful, significant costs&quot; most can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t invest using specialist skills or tools most don&#x27;t have. Are you telling me you fully reverse engineer all the state and code paths in every proprietary offering you consider along with a robust evaluation against known vulnerabilities? Or do you look at their stated claims, prior/current credibility, and perform some basic evaluation? Most of us do the latter for economic reasons and that leaves proprietary software as a black box.<p>As for Microsoft, there&#x27;s all kinds of people reverse engineering their code with most doing it to write exploits. So far, nobody has shared a link to a bug-for-bug compatible source equivalent for Bitlocker to analyze for cryptography issues. I&#x27;d just be taking someone else&#x27;s word that (a) they R.E.&#x27;d it enough to see all potential subversions, (b) they had the skill to spot clever subversions with little context, and (c) they weren&#x27;t lying to me. Please link to papers showing such a full deconstruction of the Bitlocker code with a hash that we can use to confirm it&#x27;s the same on our machines. It will boost everyone&#x27;s confidence in the product. Otherwise, you&#x27;re talking like it&#x27;s been rigorously R.E.&#x27;d and reviewed while providing <i>zero citations</i> to back that. Meanwhile, the Internet is full of citations on Microsoft&#x27;s security failures and deceptions. Status quo stands until you deliver proof otherwise.",1433473368

If you rattled off a list of these names to a grandmother, chances are that she could divine the purpose of each website.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Trello, and I think the name works well the same way that &quot;Xerox&quot; worked well -- because most people really don&#x27;t have another word for kanban systems or photocopies, and the product name suddenly defines the category. But unless you&#x27;re churning out revolutionary new products rather than refining existing ideas, I think it makes sense for your name to in some way characterize your product.",1433473219

For instance, his ""extensions"" ""overflow"" is a case where 2-3 character strings are ""overflowing"" a MAXPATHLEN buffer.<p>Favorite quote: ""Seems like there’s some changes here to determine correct stack direction on the native CPU. Why, that could be a stack smash exploit in the making!"" You go, Zed.<p>Two tips:<p>1. It's Ruby. Go write the exploit. If you think it's the patch to bignum (where the offset you're looking at only controls a load, not a store), write the testcase and prove it.<p>2. Read the code, not the diffs.",1214056609

223666,comment,223654,223654,0,0,ljlolel,,,"I love the changes to the language to remove the warts and to improve consistency across the language.  Python thrives on consistency and always having exactly one obvious, readable way to do something.  I welcome the simplified integer math, print function, unicode string unification, and other changes.<p>However, the biggest change, potentially, is function annotation.  Function annotation brings the possibility of an extra level of documentation in code, of static-style type-checking which can easily be turned off in production, and of a standardized design by contract programming style.<p>Hopefully, we will have even bigger, easier to understand Python programs!",1214056301
223665,comment,223380,223442,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"That's rather unfair. Visual Studio 2008 is several orders of magnitude faster, more powerful, and <i>much</i> more responsive than NetBeans. NetBeans is cleaner, but once you get used to VS you'll realize it's the best IDE. This, coming from someone who used to live and die by IntelliJ & NetBeans. Visual Studio is a really great IDE, and togther with the .NET Framework is one of Microsoft's greatest achievements and a huge boon for coders working on MS' platforms.<p>I agree with the rest of what you said though, but I don't think it's applicable to VS.NET. For instance, you could have talked about how bloated Office has become; while it still has tons of good new features, they're inefficiently done. You could have discussed how while Windows is a decent design/principle it has an increasingly more shitty implementation with each and every revision. But Visual Studio?? Well, I wish I could use it on Linux right now!",1214055553
223664,comment,223552,223598,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"But the whole point/problem with the ""Long Tail"" is that it's inefficient. A single person can benefit from a single portion of the Long Tail without trouble, and all the different single persons benefiting from all the different little portions of the Long Tail add up to make something huge; but for one person to mine through the entire Long Tail isn't easy.<p>It's been the concept of many social networks, from Technorati to Delicious and even to HN - the Long Tail is difficult to mine, inefficient to follow-up on, and generally not worth the trouble when you can keep up with the A-list instead.<p>I'm sure there are some non-Blockbuster movies that would fit me <i>perfectly</i> and that I'd enjoy them far more than my current ""top 10"" Hollywood moovies; but, you know what, the effort it would take to locate these, the time wasted watching billions of hours of NON-good stuff just makes it not worth it.<p>That's the perpetual problem with the Long Tail.",1214055396

I totally agree with Jeff Atwood on that.<p>However, while you're at it, why not ask people for their facebooks/myspace credentials? You'll find many more ""friends"" there than in my email contacts, plus facebook is far less sensitive privacy-wise. If someone got hold of my credentials, the maximum they could do is deface my profile and send some stupid messages to friends. If they got hold of my gmail account, they could access almost every other account that I have through ""forgot your password"" links...<p>Not that I'd actually give you my facebook credentials though :)",1214054473

There are few options
1. Redirecting to Yahoo/Gmail page where the user signs and authorizes Yahoo or Google to give us the user's contact. This gives the user the secure feeling.
2. Same as 1, but instead of redirecting show it in a big frame on same page, so the user feels he has not left the page and can if the user wishes find friends through another webmail account.<p>which do you think is better for you(and normal not so tech savvy users)?",1214053491

My feed reader catches most interesting news, already, so for me, the discussion provides the greatest value.<p>To keep the baby not the bathwater, what about putting up the submission-level down arrow, but only for Ask YC submissions?",1206914315

150439,comment,149887,150052,0,0,apathy,,,"<i>PG owes you thanks for taking the time to rant a bit on the way out</i><p>I disagree, and here's why.  PG is clearly benefiting from this bully pulpit as a means to recruit startup founders.  Especially in the midst of Startup School (the periodic anti-September of YC) and a waning interest in risky ventures as the economy contracts, it serves as a barometer.  Plus the type of crowd that sailed in from TechCrunch has been revealed (if that is the right word) as generally free of merit.  I do not believe that judging news.YC as if it were yet another social news site (YASNS, if I have to use the phrase ever again) is appropriate, and hence the rant is perhaps less valuable than it would be on, say, reddit.<p>As BrandonM noted, it's still the best source for news that interests this particular subset of the public.  However, as another poster noted, perhaps the interesting observations that previously lay unnoticed have been exhausted, and the hard work of turning over new stones, starting new companies, and learning new things must begin.<p>There's only so much you can learn in the library.  Eventually you need to get in the laboratory or out in the field.  I suspect that is as much to blame for the change in interest levels as anything else.<p>(JMHO)",1206914125

150436,comment,149887,149985,0,0,apathy,,,"<i>The third worst, ironically, is the one complaining about the problem</i><p>Why is that ironic?  No solutions are presented.  No value is generated.  An individual starting a company or hacking on a problem does not grow as a result of having read the story.  It is self-referential, self-aggrandizing, and as you point out, among the worst entries in the derby.<p>It sounds as if vote-weighting has a good deal of merit, based solely on the three pieces of evidence presented.",1206913760

150428,comment,149743,150425,0,0,tptacek,,,"My answer remains as it was before: the producers of content, who sell to a dwindling number of honest buyers as a result of a growing number of dishonest freeloaders who believe content should be priced at its marginal cost. That's an externality of downloading and using content you would not otherwise pay for.<p>But I think this argument is a red herring. Fewer people today buy DVDs, now that they can be easily downloaded. Ten years from now --- barring the success of BD+ --- it will be trivial to download DVDs, and fewer people still will buy them. I don't think reasonable people dispute this fact.<p>The drop in content revenue comes directly out of the hide  of the content producers. The issue isn't ""the people who wouldn't buy the content anyways"". The people who gorge themselves on content they wouldn't otherwise buy <i>don't buy  any content</i>. It's ironic that they excuse themselves by taking yet more illicit content.",1206912499

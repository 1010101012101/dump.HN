However, I disagree with the notion that programming is ""a very small subset"" of Computer Science -- even though I think Dijkstra would probably agree with you on that.  I think programming is a <i>large</i> subset of Computer Science.  Yeah, there's a lot more to it than that, but in my book the practical side of things is more important than Dijkstra seemed to think it was.<p>He was obviously brilliant and very perceptive with regard to many things in the field.  However I still think it is over the top that the guy didn't even own a computer.<p>There are many who would rather spend their careers just writing applications without ever analyzing the differences between two algorithms, much less ever studying or thinking about computation in general.  Then there are those who would spend their careers strictly on theoretical endeavors, and do not wish to continue writing applications or software systems of significant value.  It is my personal opinion that the best Computer Scientists are the ones that regularly do both.",1263571137

They want you to stick around and learn how to get rock-hard abs in your sleep with a patch.<p>Twitter accounts are blocked from following too many people if they have a high follower-to-following ratio, so in order to have a large audience, you have to keep this ratio closer to 1.<p>An 'internet marketer' will follow many people in an automated fashion.  Some will follow them back - either automatically, or because the scammer is convincingly faking a real person.  The ones that don't follow them back are useless to the scammer.  He therefore needs to unfollow them - so he can drop his following-to-followed ratio and begin the cycle again.  SocialToo (and many other tools) help with this by automating the unfollowing part of the process.<p>Promoting scammy affiliate offers through Twitter only scales to an interesting point through automation, so if you break the automation, you break the process.  That's what I assume Twitter is doing.  The scammers will eventually replace API-based methods with screen-scraping bots, which is what they use for other social sites around the web.",1263570476

To me it still feels like the polite thing to do to follow back if somebody follows me - it is like answering ""hello"" if somebody says ""hello"" to you. Except that I completely stopped managing my Twitter followers atm, because it became too overwhelming.<p>Another example is #FollowFriday - how do you react if somebody recommends you? Recommend them back? Does recommending somebody mean you value your other followers less? And so on - just saying that there are still some issues...<p>Another issue is that if you are a company and want people to be able to contact you via Twitter, you basically have to auto-follow. People can only send you DMs if you follow them, after all. So if the following-limits become a problem, I could see auto-unfollow help, too.",1263568910

I really love computers and programming, but I sort of lost interest in studying it at the university as it was just a rat race.<p>After a semester of exploring random classes I decided that I wanted to do History. It wasn't an easy choice by any means. Previous to this exploration I was really trying to focus on doing well in engineering, but I was constantly fighting myself. I would say that was one of the worst periods of my life. I was doing something which I felt I was obliged to not because I truly enjoyed it.<p>I talked to my parents and they were open with me changing my majors. I think that was my biggest fear, what my parents would think. When they accepted my change of major that was big relief for me. However, when I told my relatives (here in the states) they had quite a shock.<p>I must say changing to history was one of the best things I have done. I love studying it as opposed to drudging it. The wonderful thing is that I supplement history with classes from the linguistics, psychology, and economics departments.
Further, since I am concentrating on Indian history whenever I talk with Indians (from India) more often than not I know much more about India than them.<p>This rote learning is why India has not produced an Apple or Google! That's not to say there aren't brilliant engineers in India, there definitely are! But family and friends in India see outside the box thinking as unusual. When I visited India over the summer and told people I studied History they did not comprehend what that meant. The choices were: business, doctor, or engineer.",1263568404

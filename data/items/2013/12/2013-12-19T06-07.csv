She said she doesn&#x27;t care if I don&#x27;t work during that time. She feels this will be good for me mentally and that it will/might bring opportunities to the table at one point or another.<p>First?  I&#x27;d argue this is as much a relationship issue as a career issue.   Treat it as such.   When you are down, and relying on your support network to help you out, remember that you are relying on your support network to help you out and act accordingly.   I mean, every relationship is different, and I can&#x27;t tell you how to act in yours, but be conscious that you are using your support network.<p>(this can cause problems for you as much as it can cause problems for other people;  accepting help can be hard.  But either way, it&#x27;s something you need to come to terms with.)<p>Next?<p>>My current view is that my only way out is through entrepreneurship. I need to keep trying until I hit upon something that works. I know I have a few potentially good ones but I don&#x27;t have enough money to launch them correctly. I have to boostrap from small ideas to larger ones.<p>See, after a business failure?  I really like to work for other people.   Usually when I get a full time job, people think I&#x27;m pretty great, and generally I make more money working for other people than for myself (Apparently, I am not a particularly competent business person.)  Anyhow, working for other people tends to rebuild both my damaged self-esteem and my damaged financial situation.<p>Another thing?  Unless you are going for VC?  Now is the worst time to bootstrap (unless you are selling to the VC funded... and if you plan on selling the company, rather than selling a product to the VC funded?  I suspect you are too late on the bandwagon.)  -  It is difficult to compete with people who have VC and don&#x27;t immediately need to make payroll.<p>So yeah;  were I you?  I would focus on contracting and/or on getting a regular job.<p>Now, I live in Santa Clara, not Santa Clarita, but from what I&#x27;ve seen?  there are a lot of old guys in the embedded systems market.   Can you handle VHDL or the like?   Can you handle contracting?<p>I&#x27;m assuming that your contacts are stale or otherwise not all that useful.   (First thing?  call everyone who worked for you in the past.   I&#x27;ve found that ex-employees generally think more of me than I think they ought.)<p>If you really don&#x27;t have contacts (or want easy work... in my experience, if I get a job through contacts, I actually have to /work/  -  if I can attract a random recruiter, usually the standards are way lower.)<p>That is... honestly, I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is.  I have really, really good luck with recruiters, and I don&#x27;t know why.<p>Part of it is that if a recruiter spams me about a job I&#x27;m qualified for (and it is spam;  none of them put any effort into vetting me first, as evidenced by all the offers I get for jobs that I&#x27;m obviously unqualified for)   I respond.<p>But... part of that is that I&#x27;m on the recruiter mailing lists, and my resume kicks off the keyword searches.  I don&#x27;t know why or how this happened.    The last recruiter who contacted me (I wasn&#x27;t interested, but I referred him to  a friend who got the job.)  He said that he found me on Dice... but I haven&#x27;t been active on DICE for at least four years, so I don&#x27;t know if the guy was lying or if the net was just that wide.<p>I&#x27;ve even gotten jobs responding to craigslist ads (posted by body shops.)<p>But yeah, I... don&#x27;t really understand why I seem to have such luck with recruiters.

I would presume most people would prefer to not listen to others talking and prefer silence. Therefore I think it&#x27;s just inconsiderate to carry on a loud conversation within a plane where people are forced to have to put up with it and can&#x27;t avoid the irritation.",1387433297

6933162,comment,6929191,6932221,1,0,politician,,,"I don&#x27;t have a particular answer to your rhetorical questions, but I do have some thoughts on inflation and deflation, specifically with regard to their relationship to hoarding and the money supply.<p>First, deflation encourages hoarding when the holder can afford to spend at some infinite later date, but some spending happens earlier than the heat death of the universe by necessity (e.g. food and shelter, grandma needs assistance, execution of wills).<p>Second, when a currency is printed (inflated) by its host country, the effects of the increased money supply aren&#x27;t experienced proportionally or immediately everywhere. Instead, the first pallet of new money retains most, if not all, of the buying power represented at the previous level of supply.  This represents an asymmetrical information advantage for the producer of the currency, and represents a disadvantage for the currency consumer who probably isn&#x27;t in a position to know whether they are selling goods for &quot;cheaper&quot; currency. For example, if you were playing poker, and had the ability to print Aces on demand and legally inject them into the game, the other players might not like that (esp. if the new cards are injected after they&#x27;ve already calculated their odds and placed a bet).<p>Various economic philosophies consider it best to have some level of inflation to lubricate the flow of goods and services between buyers and sellers, and in these cases it would be useful for everyone if the size of the money supply was widely known.  Unfortunately, there are many different definitions for money supply such that it&#x27;s actually pretty much impossible to know how much the value of one unit of the currency has changed between two points in time without comparing them to a third, also variable, commodity or currency (e.g. gold, foreign currencies)<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a deterministic money supply where any individual can determine the upper bound of the amount of supply at any time.  In our poker analogy, the deck might be short a few cards, but no one has an extra stack of Aces in their shirt sleeve, and everyone can calculate their odds independently.  Advanced investors can even enumerate the public ledger and determine the level of lost or otherwise illiquid coins to determine a tighter bound.<p>The ability to have a good understanding of the supply of the currency is one reason that Bitcoin is so exciting for long-distance transfers.",1387432891

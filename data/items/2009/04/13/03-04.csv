If you're prepared to spend time nursing the system, compiling everything, tweaking packages/the OS itself for every bit of performance possible, the Gentoo is a good solution.  Until you're talking about really big scaling though, it's probably more time effective to use another distro.<p>As far as the rest goes, it would be better to use Debian before Ubuntu, but there's a lot of other distros as well.  RHEL powers many of the webs servers as does SuSE and Debian and Gentoo.  Once you get past that, it's mostly personal preference.<p>Also, big plugs for nginx.

If it's no big deal for the data to get there a few seconds after it's been generated polling every 10 seconds will usually cause less strain on your servers than keeping lots of connections open.

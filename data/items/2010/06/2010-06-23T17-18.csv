  it. The estimated  reading time  is 15.62 minutes. Later, when Marietta does
  her end-of-day statistical roundup, sitting in her private office  at  9:00
  P.M.,  she will see the name  of each employee and next to it, the amount of
  time spent  reading this memo, and  her reaction,  based on the time  spent,
  will go something like this:

     Less than 10 min. Time for an employee conference and possible attitude
       counseling.
     10-14 min. Keep an eye on this employee; may be developing
       slipshod attitude.
     14-15.61 min. Employee is an efficient worker, may sometimes miss
       important details.
     Exactly 15.62 min. Smartass. Needs attitude counseling.
     15.63-16 min. Asswipe. Not to be trusted.
     16-18 min. Employee is a methodical worker, may sometimes get hung
       up on minor details.
     More than 18 min. Check the security videotape, see just what this
       employee was up to (e.g., possible unauthorized restroom break).

    Y.T.'s mom  decides  to  spend  between  fourteen and  fifteen  minutes
  reading the memo. It's better for younger workers to spend too long, to show
  that they're careful,  not  cocky. It's better for  older  workers  to go  a
  little  fast, to  show good management  potential. She's pushing forty. She
  scans through the memo,  hitting the  Page Down button at reasonably regular
  intervals,  occasionally  paging back up  to  pretend to reread some earlier
  section. The computer is going to notice all this. It approves of rereading.
  It's  a small  thing, but over a decade or so this stuff really  shows up on
  your work-habits summary.</code></pre>",1277315799

It's like dragging to the recycle bin, except that: 1. the drop location is a ""region"", not an icon (a bit more general);  2. the action isn't to move a file, but to unlock the device (ie.  trigger this specific global event)<p>This doesn't seem sensational to me, but it does sound like a good idea: simulating a slider for unlocking. ""Pocket unlocking"" would be less likely to happen, and it would look cool. Although drag-n-drop is well known, it's never been used to trigger a global event (TMK).<p>The subsequent claims refine this: the icon must be dragged along a displayed route; or within channels; or the direction of dragging is given by arrows or text (presumably randomized). These aren't purely ""gestures"" because they involve interaction with elements on the screen.

""system"" and ""method"")<p>Just because someone claims something doesn't mean it's true. Like any other claim - in a thesis, in an advertisement, by a politician - it may be true or false.

This usually runs around $20 per signing.<p>That said, because of some of the things we do with wifi scanning on the buddycloud client, we have to sign four different versions: one for each varient of S60 with different ways of handling wifi. So figure on each code fix costing $80.<p>We've also found the approval process SLOW. We tried to use Symbian.org's Horizon free signing system but they always loose the order and it ends up taking them about a month to get the 4 binaries signed.  We've gone through this a couple of times and it's never improved.<p>Then it takes Ovi at least two weeks to get the binary into the market and through their content approval process.<p>It's all total effing built-by-a-committee bullshit.<p>My money is on Android's zero bullshit approach winning out over Nokia's sloth and Steve's ego.",1277313135

Type 1 is right, type 2 isn't.<p>After 15 years of writing code I can only vouch for two metrics of code quality: clarity and length. For a long time I too thought that clarity means using ""thisIsAStudentBirthDate"" variable names - but it turns out there are very very few instances where the shortest code isn't also the most obvious at first glance.<p>I think the turning point was when I decided rewrites aren't a bad thing. I started seeing the code as alive - unchanged code isn't good, is dead. The myth of perfect code is just an illusion. Writing for the next version sounds very sensible - until you get enough years under your belt to realize that either there won't be a next version or it won't be anything like you expect.",1277312993

The problem is that the syntax is so verbose and horrible in 2.0 that the readability of the code can be quite messy and almost not worth the effort.<p>C# 3.0 greatly simplified things with the introduction of the lambda function syntax hence why a lot more people have suddenly ""discovered"" closures in .NET.<p>When first learning C# 2.0 I had a lot of difficulty understanding how to use delegates with closures mainly because I couldn't get past the syntax. Learning and using Python shortly after helped me tremendously in understanding how closures worked and when to use them because (not surprisingly) the Python syntax is so much cleaner and intuitive. I was able to then transfer and apply this knowledge to C# by cutting through the noise and using closures effortlessly (as needed). When lambdas arrived in 3.0, it was a no brainer.<p>This experience showed me how being exposed to and learning other programming languages that follow different paradigms can have a positive impact on how you write code in your primary language.",1277312757

It allows you to encrypt emails with attachments up to 50mb that the client then accesses through a secure web portal which they create a username/password for, so there's no need for your friend to manage any keys or certificates. Clients can also reply to emails through the portal, keeping all communication encrypted. There are even special scanning algorithms specifically for legal professionals (and health, finance, government, etc.) that will automatically encrypt emails with sensitive data even if your friend forgets to do it herself. It's all designed to make encrypted email as simple as regular email so nobody has to worry about it. Check it out at www.greenviewdata.com/encryption.",1277312526

Put up or shut up and leave: this is the core of EA's Human Resources policy. The concept of ethics or compassion or even intelligence with regard to getting the most out of one's workforce never enters the equation: if they don't want to sacrifice their lives and their health and their talent so that a multibillion dollar corporation can continue its Godzilla-stomp through the game industry, they can work someplace else.<p>But can they?<p>The EA Mambo, paired with other giants such as Vivendi, Sony, and Microsoft, is rapidly either crushing or absorbing the vast majority of the business in game development. A few standalone studios that made their fortunes in previous eras -- Blizzard, Bioware, and Id come to mind -- manage to still survive, but 2004 saw the collapse of dozens of small game studios, no longer able to acquire contracts in the face of rapid and massive consolidation of game publishing companies. This is an epidemic hardly unfamiliar to anyone working in the industry. Though, of course, it is always the option of talent to go outside the industry, perhaps venturing into the booming commercial software development arena.

1581924,comment,1581767,1581767,0,0,Mz,,,"There is a book called ""The Truth about Addiction and Recovery"" that you might find interesting.  One of the points it makes is that focusing overly much on the drinking problem tends to make it harder to solve.  That resonates with me.  My father drank a great deal in his youth, probably to try to drown out memories of his time on the front lines in two wars.  He developed a heart problem when I was a little girl, blamed it on the drinking and never drank again.  I think part of why that worked is because he was never labeled ""an alcoholic"" and my mother never made a big issue out of his drinking, in part because he wasn't a mean drunk and there was always enough money.<p>I think people do things for a reason.  I would wonder what the reason was and try to address that in a non-blaming, non-controlling fashion.  I think trying to ""fix"" another human being generally comes across as blaming and controlling and, because of that, tends to be rejected by the intended recipient. You might also consider reading some material by Deepak Chopra concerning the impact of the mind/attitudes/mental framing on health outcomes.<p>Good luck with this.",1281120066

I think your argument is strong when applied to those leaks only.<p>However what about the leaks that are simply ""bad news"" about the war?  My take is that a large chunk of the recent Wikileaks (as well as the apache helicopter video) fall into the category of bad news rather than qualify as useful intelligence for an adversary.<p>Perhaps our intuitions about Wikileaks diverge because of our different assessments of the character of the bulk of the leaked info.<p>I would argue that Wikileaks the institution could (and probably ought to) cleanse the leaked info of information that directly aids in the enemy's intelligence gathering effort. This may be part of an evolving Wikileaks institution, etc.<p>Bad news, however, is fair game, and the traditional media has tasked itself with a shockingly minimal range of things to consider bad news.  To get a notion of the extent of war cheer-leading in the US media, watch the animated graphics that slide in when war topics are discussed (the Onion had a brilliant parody of this).<p>Also, the case could be made that the leaks make it harder for Obama to continue to wage war.  Ultimately, pulling out the troops will save more lives and limbs than the leaks will endanger.   I'm not arguing that Wikileaks is good b/c pulling out is good, only bringing this up because I think that if soldier lives are the barometer we use this argument ought to be considered.<p>I agree with you in theory that the US war machine should be restructured, but I consider that highly unlikely to happen via the democratic process, especially if there is such tight propaganda control over the information that gets out about how the war is being waged.<p>Fortunately, I think Americans get a bad taste in their mouths when watching the Apache helicopter video.  Most will (rightly) not condemn the soldiers, but will instead have a realization about the ugliness of war... and most importantly the <i>imprecision</i> of war.<p>I'm not entirely a pacifist, but I generally believe that people prefer peace and trade and don't care much about the grand causes their leaders use to rally them to war.<p>The biggest realization for me has been just how critical propaganda is to waging war.  Years and Billions had been spent villianizing Saddam Hussein, a former ally, and even today well meaning people all over the western world help with the next phase of war propaganda as they decry mistreatment of women in the Arab world.  Sure it's bad, but who wouldn't want to invade and teach a lesson to the people who cut the nose off of the fine featured woman on the recent Time magazine cover.<p>Wars can only be waged by the US if several of the following conditions are met:  a) The US has the moral high ground, b) we are saving someone, c) we are dropping bombs on people with a backward culture, d) the enemy leader is insane and potentially religiously fervent.<p>I think it's important to observe just how significant and deep the propaganda is about the middle east in the US, and how ripe Americans are to approve of more wars there.<p>It is here that I think our rationality is being challenged most aggressively.<p>Wikileaks succeeds if it casts doubt on the official story, the official numbers, the official assessments.<p>Perhaps domination/destabilization of the middle east is crucial for the continued success of the US empire, but I think it comes with a fairly high moral pricetag.  To the extent that Wikileaks aids us in seeing through the propaganda and making an accurate moral judgment of the wars, it makes us a wiser, more humane people.",1281119582

1581871,comment,1579444,1581244,0,0,jerf,,,"No, power to the people as a philosophically-organizing principle was quite popular around the time Digg was created. The idea is that the big problem with the world is that the control is all in the hands of $WRONG_GROUP and the correct solution is just to democratically hand all the power out to your userbase and it'll all just magically work because you've solved the underlying problem.<p>The error of this thinking was the downfall of Digg, and for another example, Third Voice. Also, numerous blog owners initially fell for the idea that removing comments from their site is ""censorship"" on par with how evil it is when governments do it, and this idea is still current, even though it's nothing more than a recipe for getting destroyed by trolls after a certain critical mass is obtained. Like I said, the right answer is something else entirely. It's a recurring cycle on the Internet; somebody decides power-to-the-people is the way to go, the problems become manifest, the community takes action to contain the damage or simply flames out entirely, and some idealistic group of people get pissed off, declare that the people are now powerless and it's time for power to the people, starting the cycle over again. I've watched at least 3 iterations of this over the past 10 years. We're due for another ""power to the people"" explosion which right now is most likely to manifest in the distributed-Facebook community.",1281119182

Scaling.<p>It's objective, or it feels objective. You load the web page, it takes 20ms. You make a tweak and load the page again, it takes 15ms.

Lisp lacks good libraries, period.  Couple years ago I have a project in mind and tried to develop it in Lisp.  I couldn't find good libraries on database binding, SMTP/POP3/MIME, threading, Unicode, etc.  Most were abandon-wares or not complete.  Sure I could have written them in Lisp, but then I would be developing Lisp libraries instead of my app.<p>The JGraphT example he picked was a bad one since Lisp supports the graph-like data structure happily.  It's like saying you don't need a hashtable library since it's already supported natively in the language.<p>Edit: I don't mean to bash Lisp (I like it a lot and had done a Lisp implementation in C) but the standard Lisp library issue is a real one.  It should not be just swept under the rug.",1281117959

1581793,comment,1579444,1580868,0,0,flatulent1,,,"Fighting for parking spaces... you might be surprised how underhanded even that can get.  The state of California has a rule in the vehicle code about abandoned cars.  It's clearly intended to deal with cars people just walk away from (without intent of coming back), and perhaps some that are left in unsafe places (on the freeway etc.) The code mentions the court system addressing some aspects of it.<p>The city of San Luis Obispo (known as being the first for banning smoking in public places and one of the first to have curbside recycling) came up with 72 hour abandonment.  There are no 72 hour parking signs.  But go on vacation, away to visit family, carpool or use your bike instead of driving, bed in bed with the flu for days... and a car left is in violation.  They mark a tire and the street with chalk and leave a little ""courtesy notice"" under a windshield wiper and then at three days tow.  Beside the high towing fees, and a substantial impound release fee, there is also a citation for abandonment ($280).
Of course the towing contractors charge a hefty per day storage fee.  They (the city police and parking agency) may reduce/rename the abandonment citation considering picking up the car from the towing yard to be ""no intent to abandon"".  Of course some strapped for cash may not be able to get a car right away, and end up losing a vehicle due to the high ransom at the towing yard.  The pirates may extract a lot of money for cargo ships, but on a personal level what the City of San Luis Obispo does to people hits harder as a percentage.<p>Note that this practice happens even in from of ones own home, even if there is no parking shortage.  Neighbors that don't get along use it as a way to harass each other, and in some places people call in complaints to tr and get parking spaces.  As a college town, there are many places were units have no off-road parking, or insufficient off road parking.  The city makes money on this, as do the towing contractors.  They see to meet the public notice requirements without people noticing... I know of an employee who has bought dozens of vehicles at auction for the minimum bid (towing/storage fees).<p>There's dirty business at every level it seems.",1281117925

5491175,comment,5490988,5490988,2,0,fusiongyro,,,"The biggest problem with the gaming industry is that they think they should give a shit what vocal gamers say on internet forums. They've hemmed themselves into a weird little violent, misogynistic, anti-kid, anti-family, hyper-competitive corner because the loudmouth bullies that play the popular games are loud about it. Computer gaming is basically a counterculture trying to run itself as if it were Hollywood. You can't keep alienating larger and larger segments of the marketplace and just raising the price of admission. Eventually you have to lower your costs. The news lately is that they're noticing they can't throw Hollywood budgets at high-speed Germanic thrash metal markets and make back the investment. You can, however, throw Metal Blade budgets at them and do quite well. They just need to relearn how to do that, and the indie gaming industry is showing them how.<p>Look at everything the indie gaming industry is getting right. They're focused on polish, family-friendliness, low stress, low risk, low investment fun. That's the real takeaway from Angry Birds. Angry Birds doesn't need high pressure, extremely realistic death, a complex story, voice acting, a new 3D engine with photorealistic cloud shadowing or any of that other shit. It's a simple, fun game, and it's $1. It cost so much less to make than the big-ticket games it's ridiculous, and it made way more money because everybody could buy it for themselves, for their kids, for their friends' kids, and nobody had to wonder if it would be socially acceptable or get them into trouble. In-app purchases are not the problem. The problem is that over half the marketplace won't go near a modern game, but will happily spend a dollar or two (or ten or a hundred) on non-confrontational, unrealistic distraction. Gaming is fundamentally entertainment, and the whole country gets bored. The problem is emphatically <i>not</i> lack of a market, it's just lack of understanding what the market wants and will bear.",1365053947

5491157,comment,5490988,5490988,1,0,sfrechtling,,,"Thats a very big question. I think the first step to understanding this is outlining what is happening in the industry: i) casual gaming is growing (iphone all the way to wii) ii) piracy is growing iii) social gaming is growing (attached to facebook's growth) iv) game studios merged in the 90s and 00s and now are too big v) in app purchases actually do work vi) kickstarter games and indie games are growing in popularity.<p>My summary of this is that larger studios are sticking with what works (makes money) and are looking more and more like hollywood - they want low risk games and are mostly only concerned with money. Games in this category: COD, NFS etc. Piracy is growing, and taking a large cut of revenue. Diablo III and other games made a lot of money, but implemented quite strong DRM - maybe they are taking Diablo's lead and ensuring revenue (or at least making it hard for widescale pirating. Casual and Social gaming is growing introducing new places to play, leading to different types of games (Temple Run, Farmville etc) that are built on a different revenue model - FREEMIUM. This means that in app purchases support the development and support of the game, along with advertising. There may be a merging of hardcore games and casual games in terms of business models, but I think even the games themselves may become more similar. The growth of indie games will ensure a large scope of game level/immersiveness.",1365053652

I was only saying that even though there are tons of startups, most startups are not very valuable. Given that everything follows a power law, I don't think this is just an opinion, but rather a widely held sentiment in the VC community, the Y Combinator community, and the wider SV community.<p><i>In these clusters is where VC's or angel investors are spoiled for choice, they may not have perfect substitutes but they are pretty darn close.</i><p>VCs and angels understand that it's not the idea, it's the team. There is most certainly clustering of ideas (i.e. crowdfunding, X-sharing, etc.) Yet VCs are by no means spoiled when it comes to choice of teams. There is a <i>huge</i> amount of variability when it comes to the quality of founding teams. The best founding teams will still get extremely high valuations, and mediocre teams will get no funding at all.<p><i>>This is just not true. Angel Investing is damn hard</i><p>I am well aware that angel investing returns suck. I'm not talking about those people. I'm talking about founders/employees who are now multimillionaires due to acquisitions/IPOs. You forget that every time a company has an exit of 30M-1B, you now have 3-10 multimillionaires. There are probably 50+ early Facebook employees who are now dabbling in angel investing after the IPO (lackluster IPO notwithstanding).<p><i>>You are talking about extremes here again.</i><p>This sentence does nothing to actually disprove my point. The whole economics of startup investing revolves around the extremes. So of course we need to talk about the startups at the 90th and 95th percentile.

Stretching post-workout or daily but disconnected from pre-strenuous exercise seems to make you more limber/capable of movements that require more flexibility to safely/correctly do. In particular, most of the serious dancers I know stretch(ed) a huge amount (often daily) and also did fairly strenuous dance (often daily), but the static stretching and actual exercise were highly removed from each other.  There are also a lot of movements in most types of dance that are either impossible or dangerous without a certain amount of prerequisite flexibility.<p>Pre-workout warmups are also seem important for avoiding injury: if your muscles are tight/tense and you throw yourself into a strenuous exercise, my experience and everything I've heard says you're going to have a bad time.  From personal experience, but every time I've injured/hurt my muscles it was during exercise where I hadn't warmed up or had done a bare minimum of warmup.<p>Source:  Mainly personal experience and what I've seen as a former competitive swimmer (high school varsity, butterfly, fairly serious), former dancer (modern; not serious, but I know some people who were part of larger dance companies), and someone who is currently involved in fairly intense bodyweight strength training (think gymnastic conditioning).",1365051896

That's about the only thing I like in Firefox anymore though Been using Chrome because of its multi-user support (tied in with Google accounts) but Safari is soooo much better than Chrome in terms of UI and UX Latest Chrome betas, with the full integration of the address bar as a full-blown ""Google box"" (e.g. you start typing, it loads Google Instant Search without the page's classic search box)<p>I digress :)",1365051737
5491073,comment,5490758,5490857,10,0,rdtsc,,,"Basically the rule is ""don't be a dick"". Hard to quantify. I've seen coffee shops around college campuses close, because students would come in as a study group, buy $3 worth of coffee, then hog the best seats for 4 hours. Customers come in, no place to sit, turn around and leave. This happens over and over. During the busy evening or morning hours. Yeah after a while the barista can try to politely ask you to move or leave, but if  they reach that point, it is already kind of unpleasant both for you and for them.<p>If the place is almost empty, you'd actually be doing them a favor probably by sitting in there to make the place look popular and happening (those that don't know the place might skip it as well if they see it completely empty).",1365051736

Thumbprint readers aren't actually secure, and they add a large amount of friction to usage - and friction kills adoption.<p>Not only do you have to pull your phone out and hold it against some <i>thing</i>, you have to scan your thumb too. And that last part doesn't gain you any significant security increase.<p>Remember when they started integrating thumb readers into laptops and the marketing departments invented dozens of contrived use cases that sound great on paper (and <i>only</i> on paper)? How many of those use cases ever got adopted? I don't see how this one is any different.<p>I do hope for NFC though, Apple has the market presence, the mindshare, and the ""screw you all we're doing it our way"" to really enable adoption in a way Google was never able to pull off.",1365051670

I remember how I was being charged daily for some service I never used and never subscribed to. This went on for years and I wondered how my balance was depleting even when I hardly use the phone.<p>Finally, one day i began getting SMS's that I was being re-subscribed to some Hindi tunes or poetry. When i called up I was told they had been charging me a rupee a day for 2 years for this service.<p>Funny thing is that even if I had subscribed, I never got anything. So they charged me everyday for something they were supposed to send me, but never sent me.<p>They do the same thing on the internet, where they promise you some bandwidth (speed) but never deliver. After the allotted 10 GB my speed is supposed to half. But it comes down to a crawl. After i touch 80% of my bandwidth, every time I open a URL i am taken to airtel's page to buy more bandwidth. This goes on an on. (To be fair , this harassment has reduced recently, but they cheat you on bandwidth to get you to go to a higher scheme).",1365051652

My commute used to be 20min each way with car, but now I take the train which means my commute went up to 50min each way. When commuting with the car I somehow couldn&#x27;t get myself around to reading or learning new things when arriving home, even though I had the 1h/day more time on my hands. I tried different things but none of them seemed to stick, so then I just thought to myself screw it, I&#x27;ll take the train and the longer commute. Haven&#x27;t regretted that decision one bit.<p>Couple of positive things I&#x27;ve noticed after taking the train. I&#x27;m more productive in the office as I get things rolling already on my commute (note that I don&#x27;t do any work stuff on my commute) and if I&#x27;ve had productive day at the office I&#x27;m productive on the commute back, which leads I also get things done at home :) Also as the commute time is timeboxed I don&#x27;t muck about so I&#x27;m focused on the task at hand. I usually switch between reading/coding/learning depending on the mood of the day.",1419443871

Or does it need to be learned and reinforced with positive outcomes?<p>One potential problem is that people may never really develop an intrinsic motivation to work if they aren&#x27;t given a push early on. Basic Income may eliminate that first push, which I think is crucial.<p>Let&#x27;s say you are 16. If you get a job, the expectations are low and your needs are low, so you take the first thing to come along. That puts you in a mild discomfort that encourages you to seek better opportunities as they come along, and you are likely to develop a strong intrinsically a motivated work ethic.<p>With Basic Income, your needs are already met, so it&#x27;s easy to rationalize it away and just say you&#x27;ll get a job after you graduate from college. By then, the expectations are much higher and your needs are much higher, so you hold out for a better job that may never come because you have no experience. So, you just stay in your comfort zone forever.",1419443838

8793723,comment,8793346,8793505,0,0,corysama,,,"I think that you are spot-on regarding how The Hobbit comes off more as a play than a movie.<p>Another important issue is the unwitting association we have built up that inversely correlates frame rate and production quality. The movie tradition started as soon as video technology became just barely capable of supporting the medium. The enormous cost of moving beyond that ancient standard has kept movies at 24Hz for more than a human lifetime.  Later, cheaper, consumer-orientated ed tech targeted getting the best quality out of 59.97Hz television displays, so of course they used all 59.97Hz available to them.<p>Because of this quirk of history, we&#x27;ve had a frame rate & quality dichotomy with movies on one side (very high quality & 24hz) and soap operas/TV sport/live action reporting/home movies (low to abysmal production quality and 60Hz) on the other <i>for the entire life of everyone.</i><p>When MotionFlow frame rate upscaling TVs first came to market, I randomly polled people I found looking at them at BestBuy about what they thought. Even when watching super-expensive Hollywood productions, the most common response was that it &quot;looked like a high school play.&quot;  It was ludicrous to look at the enormous scenes, world-shaking special effects and top-bill actors on the screens and say &quot;Yep. High school production.&quot;  But, people did. And, they couldn&#x27;t explain why.  I think the lifetime spent unconsciously building up a mental model that high frame rate leads to low quality is probably a major factor in people&#x27;s reaction to 48&60Hz movies.",1419443416

Here:<p>[There were requests for &quot;back of a napkin&quot; calculations, so I&#x27;ve done some for the UK. To convert to USD, just add 50%, as a rough measure.]<p>tl;dr - About £80 a week seems roughly achievable as a starting point.<p>Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say I prefer thinking of this as a &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Dividend&quot; rather than a &quot;Basic Income&quot;, as the latter suggests it&#x27;s useless if it doesn&#x27;t cover a persons cost of living. I think even a small start is better than nothing, and it can be <i>increased</i> up to become a Basic Income in time. I&#x27;ll refer to it as BI (Basic Income) here though. So, let&#x27;s see what we&#x27;ve got...<p>The UK government spends £732 billion. If we subtract £222 billion for Social Protection (we&#x27;re replacing all of it with our BI), we get £510 billion required. If we add up all government income <i>except</i> Income Tax - Business Rates, Excise, etc - we get £481 billion.<p>That leaves us a shortfall of £29 billion. For the sake of simplicity, I&#x27;m going to assume that reductions in crime, the increase in VAT revenue, better health, etc are going to cover that. Let&#x27;s call it close enough for government work. At the end of the day, we currently borrow £84 billion anyway, so at worst I&#x27;ve slashed the deficit :-)<p>Income Tax brings in £167 billion. UK population I&#x27;m going to take at 60 million. So, as a starting point, that gives us a BI of £2,783 annually, or £54 ($80) a week. Well, that&#x27;s not a bad start! Let&#x27;s consider what it means for actual people. Thus far:<p>Who loves me:
 - Right-wingers. I&#x27;ve eliminated (or vastly reduced) the deficit, effectively increased the income tax allowance by £2,783 and given them this amount in cash, while reducing welfare payments to lazy, single-mother immigrants. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- Most people on Job Seekers Allowance (unemployment benefit). While I&#x27;ve cut the amount they actually get, I&#x27;ve also cut out all the paperwork, visits to the job centre, taking money off them if they happen to earn something that week, etc etc. Money without the hassle.<p>- Low wage workers. This is a big boost above Working Tax Credit and is hassle free (you don&#x27;t lose it by earning more). It also allows some degree of security in the event of losing their job.<p>Who hates me:
 - Left-wingers. While I&#x27;ve helped some low paid workers, I&#x27;ve also slashed benefits, there&#x27;s no housing support...in short I&#x27;ve cut welfare while giving more money to wealthy people. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- People who&#x27;re claiming several benefits. People who&#x27;re on sickness benefit. Basically, all the folk who&#x27;ve had their income reduced below a living wage.<p>- Pensioners. The state pension has been cut significantly (and illegally).<p>Ok, I think I need to balance it a bit more. I&#x27;m going to reduce the Income Tax allowance from £10,000 (current) to £6,000. This should balance out at the end. I&#x27;m going to assume this increases income tax revenue by 25% (I&#x27;ve no idea if this is remotely close. If anyone can be bothered finding out, please let me know). More controversially, I&#x27;m also going to increase income tax by 25%, so the basic rate is now 25% rather than 20%.<p>That should give me a total revenue increase of 50% from Income Tax which gives me a BI of £4,175 annually or £80 ($120) per week.<p>And I think I&#x27;ll leave it there. We&#x27;d need to borrow (or cut spending elsewhere) to make up other shortfalls (such as pension payments), but as long as it&#x27;s less than £50 billion we still come out ahead. It might be more natural to cut the payment to £70 for everyone in order to free up some cash for other payments. In the real world, you wouldn&#x27;t exclusively reserve Income Tax to one specific spending area anyway, but it makes things simple enough to get a rough measure.",1419443411
8793721,comment,8793346,8793346,0,0,Qiasfah,,,"Most serious FPS gamers swear by screens that have a higher update rate than 60hz.<p>In the past this was achieved by setting your CRT to a low resolution and upping the refresh rate. More recently you can get TN LCD panels that offer 120 or 144hz update rates.<p>Moving the mouse in small quick circles on a 144hz screen compared to a 60hz screen is a very different experience. On a 60hz screen you can see distinct points in the circle where the cursor gets drawn. With 144hz you can still see the same effect if you go fast enough, but it is way smoother.<p>This makes a huge difference for being able to perceive fast paced movements in twitch style games and is the reason there has been a shift to these monitors across every competitive shooter.<p>My thoughts on this is that this behavior is similar to signal sampling theorems. Specifically the Nyquist theorem talks about how you have to sample at at least 2x the max frequency of a signal to accurately represent the frequency. For signal generation this means that you have to generate a signal at at least twice the rate of the max frequency you want to display. If you want to accurately reconstruct the shape of that signal you need 10x the max frequency (for example two samples in one period of a sine wave makes it look like a sawtooth wave, ten samples makes it look like a sine wave).<p>So, if you&#x27;re moving your mouse cursor quickly on a screen or playing a game with fast paced model movement even if your eyes can only really sample at something like 50-100hz the ideal monitor frequency might be 1000hz. There&#x27;s a lot of complexity throughout the system before we can get anything close to this (game engines being able to run at that high of a framerate, video interfaces with enough bandwidth to drive that high of a framerate, monitor technology being able to switch the crystals that fast, etc.).<p>Yes, 48fps movies typically look less cinematic, but I think this is a flaw in movie making technology and not of the framerate. The fight scenes in the hobbit sometimes look fake because you can start to tell how they aren&#x27;t actually beating up the other person. This detail is lost at 24fps and is why they have been able to use these techniques.",1419443407

I don&#x27;t need to consider if 5 different libraries all have fixed the ARM optimizations errors on iOS8. I can know all the features in Ember have it fixed. In fact I don&#x27;t even need to think about the error, most likely.<p>A third and final point: Of course frameworks don&#x27;t just influence browser features. The conversation is two-way. Unlike a simple scratch-an-itch library, framework authors are constantly looking foward and thinking about how they can better align with upcoming features. Ember has iterated on its Set, Map, and promise APIs to make them match the specs. Sometimes as we align with a feature we discover unexpected architecture problems with the spec (Object.observe, web components) and push the feedback upstream. Sometimes a spec helps us solidify an un-spec&#x27;d solution, and we need to expend effort trying to move apps to that new pattern (ES6 classes).<p>Most developers who buy into SPA architecture and build complex JavaScript applications understand the value of a framework. They are not panaceas (and setting them up as one is making them a straw man), but they absolutely play a very important part in the JavaScript and web ecosystem.<p>Which is more than I can say about this post&#x27;s FUD (&quot;Remember all those MochiKit widgets you wrote? Yeah, how much good are they doing you now that you&#x27;ve migrated to Ember, or Angular?&quot; they work just fine thanks) and call to limit your ambitions for a great client-side app.",1419443359

There was no way to jump from the sensing network to command-and-control of any one machine, much less the plant.  Even if you were physically at the factory this was pretty much impossible.

8793703,comment,8791401,8793335,0,0,Bargs,,,"The number of tools has increased, but I think JS development has actually been simplified in some cases. This is largely due to the rise in popularity of rich clients talking to simple backend APIs. In older web projects JS always felt like an afterthought. Dependencies were managed totally by hand and your scripts were scattered throughout the backend templates. If you needed to do anything at all with your front-end code at build time, you had no choice but to glue some hacky solution onto the existing build process. Client and server were all mixed together, and it was painful.<p>Starting a project today, I can build a client in Javascript, hook it up to an API, and I&#x27;m done. NPM and Browserify make dependency management and builds a breeze. There&#x27;s very little friction in the development workflow because the front-end build process it totally separate from the server. I make a change, save it, reload the page and I see my changes live without even running a server locally. Even PHP&#x27;s deployment story isn&#x27;t that simple.<p>It&#x27;s true that the initial setup is more complicated than simply downloading jQuery and plopping it into an existing project, but if you have the option of separating your client and server code, it really simplifies things overall.",1419443162

For the languages with algol-inspired syntax, I feel PHP has the most oddities: &quot;$&quot;, &quot;=>&quot;, foreach (collection as iterator), etc.<p>- Inconsistency in the standard library. Naming - does the function I want have an underscore or not? isset doesn&#x27;t, is_array does. The ordering of function arguments is also often different from one function to the next. IDE or php.net can help you with this, but when you&#x27;re in a productive flow, this is an unnecessary impediment.<p>- Doing OOP in PHP, you get a lot of the verbosity of a language like Java without the type safety or standard library features. Nested arrays are common because there is a distinct lack of useful data structures in the language. Arrays are used as a mishmash of array/linked list/hash map because the language doesn&#x27;t differentiate, leading to subtle bugs.<p>- As a dynamic language, I feel it compares unfavorably to Python in just about every meaningful way. Much more verbose than Python (list, generator and dictionary comprehensions, for example, cut down on a lot of boilerplate in Python.) Less powerful metaprogramming (in Python you can override __setattr__ to execute code whenever attributes are set; in PHP you can define __set magic attribute which doesn&#x27;t work on public attributes, limiting its usefulness.) The standard library is less useful. It&#x27;s not as simple to package and deploy.<p>- Modern features are starting to creep into in the language, but I feel it&#x27;s too little too late. We recently had to upgrade a server to PHP 5.5 because I sold decision makers that using generators to stream data would result in much more maintainable code than shoehorning what we were trying to do into iterators. For a moderately large company with enough legacy, upgrading the PHP version can be an ordeal. Python has featured generators since 2003.<p>- I do feel that quality of candidates is an important consideration. A lot of people cut their teeth on &quot;HTML, CSS and PHP&quot; before moving up to &quot;real&quot; programming languages. The rate of applicants who don&#x27;t have strong programming ability will be higher for PHP than for comparable languages.<p>I&#x27;ve been using PHP professionally for almost a year and I would never use it for a project unless it was already in use.",1419443116

If you called someone at home, and they didn&#x27;t answer, you just tried later. If you called someone at a business, everyone had a secretary who could pick up if they didn&#x27;t answer. She (and it was always &quot;she&quot;) would write your message on a message slip (they were generally pink) and put it on the person&#x27;s desk. Or, for smaller businesses, you called the main number, and the operator would connect you, and take a message if no answer.<p>2) Home answering machines happened. They used cassette tapes, and you could rewind and replay your messages. The outgoing greeting was on a second tape. When you got home, or if you were screening your calls, you&#x27;d see a blinking light indicating &quot;new message&quot;, then hit buttons to rewind and play your messages. When the tape got full you could put in a new tape or write over the old messages. For businesses, phone systems became smarter and could take voicemail, but this was expensive, many businesses still used the old people-intensive way for messages, and many businesses preferred this because customers liked talking to a real person to leave a message.<p>3) Mobile phones with SMS became available to consumers. (We are into the 90s now). I don&#x27;t recall this being especially popular at first, most people still left voicemails, even on mobile phones. But SMS became more and more used over the next decade plus (before smartphones when they exploded in popularity).<p>4) Fast forward to today. People born after 1980 or so, I find, really don&#x27;t do voicemail at all, text messaging is the thing. If you leave them a voicemail, it doesn&#x27;t get listened to. The best you can expect is a callback or a text message because they saw you called, but the usual response is nothing. For businesses, some form of instant messaging (IM) is prevalent inside the company. The IM might say &quot;Hey do you have a minute to talk OTP?&quot; but no one just calls someone else cold, much less leaves a voicemail and expects a response.<p>IMO stage (1) actually worked fine, and now that we are at stage (4) that works fine too (as long as you don&#x27;t pretend voicemail is a thing and use other means of communication). The intermediate stages were awkward at best.<p>I think Coca-Cola&#x27;s action makes a ton of sense for any company. Maybe it was fear of legal discovery that prompted it, maybe it was what they said (streamlining operations), but it is a good thing, IMO.",1419442194

8793597,comment,8792192,8793392,0,0,ctdonath,,,"The concern is, on the whole, those receiving & relying on a basic income find a right to the fruits of the labors of others, without any incentive toward their own productivity. Many people find that with a little care, they can live nicely on little - and if that little is just given to them, then they can occupy their time just fine with mundane leisure (eating, mating, entertaining) and ongoing demand for more. Why contribute to national productivity when idleness is encouraged & funded?<p>Many will contend that having the basics covered will encourage the poor to be more productive by not limiting their efforts to mere existence (a la &quot;might one take time to learn programming if not obligated to a 16-hour-a-day job just to pay rent & buy food?&quot;). Many contend this is absurd, as those not inclined toward productivity are not going to become inclined without any reason to. Reality is a complex mix of these, the overall expectation being grounded in one&#x27;s faith (or lack thereof) in human productivity sans motivation.<p>Basic income also risks devaluing money. The purpose of currency is representation of value; if someone is not creating value, their money has no value to represent. Money taken from someone and given to others (taxation for BI distribution) gives workers nothing in exchange for their efforts; money received for zero productivity may be squandered a la &quot;easy come, easy go&quot;. Concern is akin to minimum wage: a gallon of gas will always be worth about 20 minutes of clerking at a gas station, regardless of the number placed upon the currency used to pay for the work and buy the gas. Basic income would skew low-number pricing: higher prices may continue to represent greater value accurately, but pricing of mundane goods/services would inflate as those purchasing have done nothing to acquire the currency buying them.<p>Basic needs have a cost to fulfill. Making it easy to fulfill those needs without social contribution reduces overall societal productivity, rewarding idleness and punishing productivity, lowering national GDP. Requiring people to work (true welfare cases aside) encourages productivity, including in work people would rather not do but for need to provide for one&#x27;s own basic needs.<p>Reverse question is worth asking: how can basic income possibly be sustainable?",1419441844

Unruly armies of tens of thousands have existed since antiquity as insurrections, unrest due to demands for change, and borderline rebellions. The ruling classes of the Roman empire had to deal with this sort of thing on a regular basis. The size of the mob is not a new thing.<p>I think the change between old and new enforcement of common law has a lot more to do with technology, specifically the development of firearms and their ability to enable a small armed group to defeat a large unarmed group.

That was somewhat short-sighted of me, but in my defense housing is quite different from something like a Blueray player or a TV. House prices are much, much more fluid than those of gadgets and are also highly localized. One house can be 3x more expensive than another carbon copy simply because it&#x27;s closer to an office district that employs a large number of comparatively wealthy people. In other words, housing prices in competitive markets are determined mostly by factors <i>other</i> than the cost of production, which can be nearly negligible in some cases. Housing prices certainly <i>would</i> go down if everybody&#x27;s income was simultaneously cut by two-thirds; this is exactly what happens when a local job market crashes (e.g., see the Houston oil crash in the 80s).<p>Regarding your final point, about standard of living simply veering upward over time, I think there&#x27;s a lot of truth to it. But I also think there&#x27;s a lot of complexity. I know plenty of folks who still live very modest lives that are barely different from the 50s -- small homes, often homes that were built in the 50s and are still standing and are in bad condition, certainly worse condition than when they were first built; small TVs; old kitchens; no vacations; public schools; many family members living in the same house; etc. These people are often working classic middle-class jobs: nurses, school teachers, etc. Despite not having many of the materialistic advances you list, they also often have pretty bad debt, either student loans or credit card debt.",1419441396

Consider these two cases using relevant historical data.<p>Case 1, Bitcoin refunds are pegged to the USD price at the time of sale and refund (your current strategy): It is currently 12/7/2014. The price per Bitcoin is approximately $380. I purchase a Christmas gift for someone,which just so happens to be exactly $380. I pay one Bitcoin, and my package is shipped. I receive the package on the 18th, at which point the exchange rate is approximately $310 per Bitcoin (about a 20% drop). At a 3% fee, I decide it would be prudent to ask for a refund, so I initiate the process and send back my gift. I am refunded $380 in Bitcoin at $310 each, and therefore receive 1.225 Bitcoin in return. I have effectively short-sold my Bitcoins while simultaneously locking the USD value in at the higher exchange rate (the value of the gift). This is a no-risk hedge, and is effective at any point the exchange rate fluctuates downwards more than 3% over the maximum refund interval. If the price goes up, I don&#x27;t get a refund, and keep the gift, effectively locking in its value.<p>Case 2, Bitcoin refunds are pegged to the amount of Bitcoin initially spent: It is currently 11/4/2014. The price per Bitcoin is approximately $320. I buy a really nice bottle of Scotch from someone, that happens to cost exactly $320. I pay with one Bitcoin. On 11/13/2014, the price has risen to $420 per Bitcoin. I decide to get a refund, and as the amount of Bitcoin I spent is refunded, I receive 1 Bitcoin in return. This is again a no-risk hedge, as if the price drops, I keep the Scotch (or sell it, and increase my net Bitcoin holdings).<p>The only way that I can see you guys not having a financial risk as a counterparty, is if you do refunds in a way pegged to both USD and Bitcoin. You could achieve this by refunding  an amount of Bitcoin equal to the product value in USD pegged to the exchange rate at the time of refund if the exchange rate rises, and refund an amount of Bitcoin equal to the amount initially paid if the exchange rate falls. This (rightly, in my opinion) puts all risk of exchange rate fluctuations solely on the person requesting the refund.<p>I understand that in charging a 3% fee on each transaction, all users of Stripe are in effect insuring your company against anyone attempting to game the system in this way, so my point may be moot (you can eat the losses from the malicious <1% of users), but I am of the strong belief that any system that can be gamed for a profit, most likely will be gamed, by some unscrupulous individual. Your company is effectively able to be used (currently) as a hedge against falling prices (scenario 1) in what is, at the moment, a year-long bear market for the exchange rate. This doesn&#x27;t really feel to me like the smartest road to go down. What are your thoughts on this?",1419440998

In many areas of the US, housing (for example) is very cheap, and much of the cost is down to the construction of the building and its amenities.  On the other hand, in parts of the UK with a decent jobs market, there&#x27;s a shortage of available land, and housing is very expensive indeed.  I spend three times what a friend in Wales spends for his (otherwise similar) house, and three times less than some other friends spend for their one bed flat in central London.  That difference in cost has little to do with the difference in intrinsic value of our properties, and lots to do with the fact that the land they sit on has differing value, thanks to the UK&#x27;s shortage of residential land in places with jobs.<p>In the south of the UK, I would tend to argue that if everyone cut an hour or two off their daily work, we might be affected a little less than you might normally think - because everyone below a certain class has a lot of their income tied up in an area that approaches a zero sum game.",1419440846

In other words, I have never seen how other directors&#x27; work would be affected by HFR.<p>Speaking exclusively about the Hobbit series in HFR, I too observed an uncanny valley that traditional films intrinsically avoid with their low frame rate.  The Hobbit films felt more like a <i>play</i> than a film.  A play with elaborate stage effects, but a play nonetheless.<p>In fact, my chief criticism of Jackson&#x27;s directing with HFR is that the feeling of watching a play is amplified by how he mixes the sound and directs his extras.  The extras routinely just mumble nonsense in the background, leaving only the character you&#x27;re intended to be focused on speaking clearly.  It&#x27;s the same thing you see in a play when there is background dialog, and it&#x27;s completely unnatural.  You find yourself sometimes distracted by the characters in the background and realizing they&#x27;re not actually doing anything meaningful or having real conversations.  For example, in the most recent film, I found myself more distracted by the unnatural audio in early scenes (such as the beach scene) than the HFR video.<p>Combine that with the poor acting by the minor characters in the first 45 minutes of the recent film and I think HFR gets a bad rap in large part because the Hobbit films alone are our point of reference.",1419440636

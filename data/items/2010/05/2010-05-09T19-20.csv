1332746,comment,1332422,1332422,0,0,lotharbot,,,"If Mark Cuban thinks the market is now all about exotic derivatives rather than buying stock in companies you believe in, he's listening to the wrong people.  Commission-based brokers talk about exotic derivatives; Warren Buffet still talks about buy-and-hold.<p>The biggest wins and losses in day trading will come from exotic derivatives simply by their nature: they're highly leveraged bets.  Those firms that create the vehicles to make those bets aren't ""hackers"", they're ""Vegas"".  You ask for a bet against the housing market or for cattle, they set up a structure to let you make that bet, and you play the odds -- and you might beat the other betters in the market over the short term, but it's the house (taking its percentage off the top) that always wins long term.  Mark Cuban is right to be uncomfortable playing that game.<p>Meanwhile, people like Warren Buffet continue to look for healthy companies that are underpriced and buy into them for the long term.  Day-to-day the market might be driven by short-term bets, but over the course of 3 decades it's still driven by the fundamental health of companies.  If anything, those who care about <i>""the performance of specific companies and their returns""</i> benefit from the fact that occasionally, as a result of day traders' bets, healthy companies' stocks get sold at bargain prices.<p>If you try to play Vegas' game, you'll probably get burned.  But if you stand back, watch the game, and buy when their game creates a bargain price on good long-term stocks, you stand to get very solid returns.",1273434463

I released another app a few weeks ago and the market has changed. Now, it's much more like the iPhone market where you fall into oblivion if you don't have some marketing strategy. Take a look at the 'just in' for all apps. It's filled with batches of 'hot babes' apps and skins apps so you fall down the list very quickly before anyone even has a chance to notice you.<p>I released a 'Sca', a spy camera app, a year ago and it's doing pretty well. Made $6,000 in 14 months. With the release of all the new phones this year, revenue has picked up to where I consistently get $30 per day after Google takes its cut. I tried $2.95, $9.95, and I settled on the current $5.95. Revenue is constant across all price points. There's no way to scoop up all price points, though, which is annoying. Anyone have any ideas for that?<p>Last I checked, you get bumped back to the top of the 'just in' list if you submit an update and it's been a few weeks since your last update, so it's a good way to spike up traffic.<p>I released a niche app for astronomy, Iridium Flares, that sells for $1.45 and makes one sale every few days.<p>I made sure my two paid apps have a free version.

I really didn't want to take any statins because of the dangerous side-effects, so my doctor prescribed niacin instead: Niaspan. I had taken over-the-counter niacin before with no results, but the Niaspan gave me the niacin flush that first night, and after a few months my LDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were all in well inside the healthy range, and my HDL was just below the healthy range. I just had my six-month followup blood tests, but I haven't gotten the results yet. I'm expecting to be in pretty good shape.<p>I've taken between 1000mg and 3000mg per night, adjusting based on my body's response. At first the flush happened within an hour of taking the pills, then it either stopped or it was happening while I slept. I ramped up the dosage as the flush effect weakened and I stayed at 3000mg for a while, but now that's too much. It seems like my body only needs 2000mg now for the full effect, but I don't flush until about six hours after I take the pills. Based on my blood test results, I may ramp up again to get the flush faster or back off to reduce it.<p>The flush itself lasts about an hour. It's not comfortable, but it's not bad either. You get hot, red, and kind of itchy. I understand that it's part of the healthy effect of the niacin: expanding your blood vessels and washing out toxins through your skin (which causes the itching).<p>If you want to try this, you need to get the prescription stuff. The OTC niacin is definitely not the same, at least not here in the US where vitamins are unregulated food products that generally don't contain what they claim to contain.",1273431874

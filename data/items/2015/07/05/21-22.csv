I can think of dozens of ways the archive could still burn.<p>Here&#x27;s just one: large earthquake breaks open the building, cuts electric power, breaks gas lines, fire starts. Firemen are overwhelmed and give priority to saving civilians in other buildings, stacks of newspapers are at the bottom of their list.<p>Another: Fire starts in building next door. Wind whipped flames set the archive on fire from the outside. Archive burns down with everything in it.<p>A third: bunch of militants take over that part of town. Set fire to the archive because they are opposed to history. Not like that has never happened before, like in ISIS controlled Iraq, and the great fire of Alexandria.<p>It&#x27;s the classic eggs-in-one-basket scenario.",1436133573

Bear in mind, an abnormality in the hippocampus or other memory related structures could be sub-mm in size and result in a significant impairment.<p>If, for example, he did not have an MRI with diffusion weighted imaging with a sufficiently high B value (gradient value) they may be missing/have missed a very small stroke (this test is also time sensitive -only positive within the first few days of insult).<p>If they did not perform susceptibility weighted imaging, they may have missed a tiny micro-haemorrhage. Both of these scenarios can result in memory loss if critical structures are involved.<p>There are also several technical issues that may have resulted in a sub-optimal scan, precluding finding a tiny abnormality. There&#x27;s also the question of whether the person reading the scan got it right or whether the strength of the magnet/technical parameters of the study were sufficient to resolve a tiny abnormality.<p>Either of these scenarios could have been a consequence of reduced blood flow (hypoperfusion), a small clot (embolus) or a tiny blood vessel injury (dissection) that could have occurred during the procedure -  possibly related to the anaesthetic but not definitively so.<p>I suspect there is a definitive abnormality that the clinicians that saw him were unable to pick up. This seams a lot more likely than the idea that we need to revise our entire conceptualisation of memory formation to suit a psychological theory.",1436133529

9835207,comment,9834296,9834855,0,0,yishanl,,,"I think there&#x27;s a ton of economic incentive for the rich to leave China and move to the US.  In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s happening now already, regardless of the performance of the Chinese economy.<p>Some observations:<p>- The luxury goods that the rich in China are looking for are much cheaper here in US.  The international students I know at school go on insane shopping sprees at the Apple/Sony/Microsoft stores since how &quot;cheap&quot; all the products are compared to the 1.5-2+X markups they have to pay back home.  I&#x27;ve seen some classmates fill their suitcases with luxury brand clothing, Apple computers, iPads, Playstations, Xbox, to all bring home and share with their families.<p>-  Assets in the US are much more appealing options in terms of investments, especially real estate/property.  There&#x27;s been a lot of stuff written up in NYT about this.  I&#x27;ve seen the same things here in South Bay (Mountain View, Cupertino) where brand new townhouses get snatched up instantly by wealthy families from China that can commit that much $ in such a short amount of time.  Being able to pay for your house in cash moves you towards the front of the line.<p>-  Avoiding the whole &quot;corrupted officials with lots of $ in bribes&quot; anecdote (despite it being somewhat true from the crazy stories that I&#x27;ve heard from friends in China), it is much easier to spend the money here without worry of alerting the Chinese government.  Especially if you&#x27;re paying for a lot of your things in cash.  Spending money in a lavish manner in China raises a lot of eyebrows.<p>-  Not too knowledgable on this aspect, but apparently there&#x27;s the loophole where if you bring aging parents in China over to live in America, they can qualify for senior benefits from the US government.  They come, despite never having worked in the US, and get monthly checks to cash that are substantial enough to live on.  Don&#x27;t know enough about this to elaborate and I&#x27;m a little skeptical about this, but have heard a lot about this.<p>-  America is so much more attractive than China.  A lot of the wealthy international students I met in college had very tracked and relatively stress-free lives growing up.  They never had to study for or take the gaokao, which is the infamous college entrance exam, since they knew from early on that they would be coming to the US for their college education.  A lot of them do try and swing for jobs here after graduation as well, since the pay is substantially higher than in China.  Heard this sentiment from a lot of Hong Kong residents.<p>Curious if anyone has heard/observed similar.",1436133411

9835197,comment,9834721,9834880,0,0,elorant,,,"Wow the amount of ignorance in this comment is staggering. Many countries have deficits for decades. Greece’s debt ballooned once we entered the Eurozone. From the hundreds of billions given as loans less than 20% went to our economy. Most were used to bailout EU banks, namely French and German ones. Greece never lived up to the agreement? Then how on earth did our GDP fall by 30% in five years? How come unemployment in young people reached 50% if we did nothing of what was agreed?<p>The reason we rejected the last bailout was because it didn’t include any terms of debt relief which is the only way for the economy to recover. That and Tsipra’s incompetence paired by an equal amount of incompetence and lies from EU officials. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango.<p>I’m not surprised that you are from Germany (I guess you read Bild a lot). Well I’m Greek and I have news for you. In 1954 we wrote off 50% of your debt to us. And we did it despite the fact that ten years ago you’ve invaded our country and wrecked havoc doing monstrosities like murdering whole villages including kids. We did out of solidarity to help your economy grow. It’s time now you do the same. It’s either that or we default and you can kiss your 70 bn loans goodbye.

Austerity, demanded as the cure for deficit spending, has dragged Greece into a recession and achieved exactly none of its aims - spending is still high as a proportion of GDP, because GDP has crashed.<p>3. The creditors have stopped demanding austerity as a policy aimed at creating a viable economy, and switched to demanding it to punish the greeks for populist leftism, and to contain the anti-austerity parties in Europe, and because they have unprofessional snits against Tsipras.<p>4. The only sane answer is to write off a huge swathe of the debt, as patently irrecoverable, inject capital, give a decade long holiday from repayments, and let the Greek economy recover.<p>5.

Because I was a heavy drinker at the time (probably the reason for the symptoms that lead the the endoscopy, ironically) the intravenous sedation had little effect, so I was awake through the whole thing.  I didn&#x27;t find it traumatic, merely unpleasant, but I think other people might have.  The local anesthetic at the back of my throat wore off after some time, so I was dry retching every few minutes.  At one point they pumped air into my stomach so they could take a sample with a needle (which was in itself painless), and that sensation was also unpleasant.<p>So while I doubt people undergoing intravenous sedation during routine surgery are in extreme pain, they may be in very uncomfortable situations that most people would rather forget.  Also if it had been effective, it would alter your state of mind as well, so that the immediate experience was less bad.",1436133231

This is strongly reflected on the ECB&#x27;s board, where Germany has the same number of votes as Malta! In order to sell the Euro to conservative Germans who feared a &quot;Transfer Union&quot; (where they would perpetually  have to bail out certain states that shall remain anonymous with a reputation for fiscal improbity) some vague promises were added about debt levels. But the promises were not accompanied by any enforcement mechanisms and soon fell by the way-side.<p>I used to ridicule Eurosceptics, seeing them as dinosaurs who are on the wrong side of history. But to my consternation, I have to accept now that  most of their worst fears have come to pass.<p>As a historical aside, it is noteworthy that about a century  ago a similar scenario played out: Greece (and others) crashed the Latin Monetary Union [1], a 19th-century attempt to unify several European currencies into a single currency that could be used in all the member states, at a time when most national currencies were still made out of gold and silver.

Beyond that, governments could issue red debts which aren&#x27;t backed by any other country, and which come with an orderly default procedure.<p>That way, the Greek government would only enjoy the great interest rates the Germans get if they were following the same strict fiscal discipline - and red debt interest rates would reflect the fact they didn&#x27;t have the German government standing behind them, so there wouldn&#x27;t be a bunch of the cheap debt that Greek politicians seemingly can&#x27;t resist.<p>Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t a very popular proposal at the moment; if it had come out 15 years ago, when everyone had a clean slate and Greece didn&#x27;t have all this debt, it might have prevented things getting to where they are now.

How long is code? How do you make sure that it&#x27;s gonna work?<p>We don&#x27;t do the coding for the flight software, that&#x27;s SciOps.<p>However here&#x27;s what I know, each set of spacecraft commands is put up as a &quot;command load&quot;, which has a name that&#x27;s the year plus the day of year. So the 15188 load runs on July 7, and has commands for nine days.<p>Each load has a multi week coding and vetting process and is simulated on the ground, on a system called &quot;NHOPS&quot;, pronounced &quot;nops&quot;.<p>-AZ<p>I emailed some folk, here&#x27;s an answer to #3, from Jillian, one of the members of our SciOps team.<p>3: We have a program called Statesim that checks to make sure constraints are not violated. For instance the Alice aperture door shouldn&#x27;t be open within 20 degrees of the Sun. We also have something called NHOps which is a software EM of New Horizons and the commands are executed on it and data is downloaded and reviewed by the instruments. We also had a rehearsal in 2013 for the Pluto Closest Approach load.<p>-AZ<p>Okay, here&#x27;s an answer from Helen Hart at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (AZ):<p>We do not program New Horizons flight software. We store commands, packaged into macros, in the portion of C&DH memory designated for command storage, and execute the macros via a Time Tag.<p>See #1.<p>How are we sure that it¹s gonna work? That¹s a really, really big question, involving multiple layers, multiple platforms, and a lengthy, intensive Load Build and Review process. For more details on the process, talk to the Science Sequencers.<p>The command load is simulated in SEQGEN, which is also where it gets built. The Seqgen Modeling File contains hundreds of checks for problems with commands vs. the state of the spacecraft/instrument. The Seqgen modeling file also contains the Mission Operations Playback Data Volume models.<p>We have a SOFTWARE SIMULATOR called stateSim which models the response of the spacecraft and payload to the command sequence. stateSim generates the file that Mission Operations Command Sequencer turns into the Command Sequence Timeline - the excel spreadsheet that is distributed as part of the load review process.<p>We have HARDWARE SIMULATORS, called NHOPS-1 and NHOPS-2, which contains HARDWARE modules for the onboard processors, including C&DH-1, C&DH-2, SSR-2, SSR-2, G&C-1, G&C-2, P-Alice, LORRI, PEPSSI, Ralph, REX-1, REX-2, SDC, and SWAP.<p>The NHOPS and stateSim simulators have different weaknesses; for example: a: NHOPS gets all the details of slews correct; stateSim gets the slew start time and duration correct, but does not track the exact path of the track because that part of the CG&C cannot be modeled in software. b: stateSim correctly predicts C&DH Thermal Control, but NHOPS does not predict this at all c: SSR usage: stateSim does not model SSR usage. NHOPS does, but gets the wrong answer for anything that gets Compressed or Packetized. SEQGEN is tied directly to commanded data downlinks, and cannot be manipulated to produce interim data volumes; it correctly models downlink data volume TO THE ACCURACY OF the Compression Ratios specified by the Science Sequencers (lately, DataTrack).<p>-- Helen",1436132707

Greece is paying the price of being in a monetary union, and it should either get help from the other members of that union, or it is not really a union.<p>2) Also, take into account that Germany and other countries are benefitting from this monetary union by being able to use a currency that is devalued due to the poorer countries, and therefore is able to increase its export.<p>3) Much of the bailout went into the banks of other eurozone members therefore helping them as well.<p>4) Do not forget that Greece if not in the eurozone would be able to default on its debts, live on the primary surplus it is now generating and when it is considered a good debtor to get loans again. Instead of having to exit the eurozone (which would be a bad sign for the whole union) and default on its debts (which would mean other countries losing money) and THEN grow, it may be beneficial to everyone to do a debt restructuring.<p>5) Greece is paying an interest on the loan given to them to be able to pay the older debts to the ECB and others. They are not able to pay that interest on the subsequent loans and are asking to be able to use that for economic growth to pay the older loans! In a sense, you can see that as debt restructuring, which can also happen in other ways. This way creditors will also get their money back, altough restructured or payed later.",1436132095

They are far more indebted than Greece but their interest rates are even lower.  There is no conceivable way that Japan is ever going to repay that debt, and it&#x27;s still growing at a pretty rapid pace.  The circumstances are different (very few JGBs are held by foreigners, and Japan issues its own currency), but it&#x27;s pretty clear from experience that extend and pretend leads to lengthy periods of anemic economic activity.  The question is whether default and workout will be any better; the record there is mixed at best.",1436131535

That would result in all Greek banks going bust and being unable to operate, unless the Bank of Greece stepped in (by implication, issuing loans to banks in drachma in exchange for defaulted or new public debt securities).

The truth is that we&#x27;re all so used to being mad at the ECB that liberals are now confounded by the least bad thing they&#x27;ve done in a while.<p>It&#x27;s long since known and agreed that austerity policies were detrimental to the recovery. The thing is that Europe&#x27;s failure to pursue expansionary monetary policyead to both diminished inflation (which means debts have larger real value) and diminished growth in the eurozone, both of which hindered Greece et al&#x27;s ability to repay debts regardless of the terms they were given. That&#x27;s added to the fact that inflation couldn&#x27;t happen and internal devaluation <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> happen as chosen by the Greek people. And internal devaluation, what happened in Ireland, is a pretty ugly process, though Ireland would be okay right now if the ECB hadn&#x27;t also blown the recovery in general, methinks.<p>Now the issue is whether Greece gets what everyone else got. It&#x27;s fair, but it isn&#x27;t exactly right. And the ECB has distracted everyone from their big failures.<p>This is also being tossed around as proof that currency unions don&#x27;t work! That&#x27;s kind of a strong conclusion. I think it could work if it were well managed and smaller and less diverse. A couple of economies in similar situations with proper economic management can probably keep things together with only a small chance of an Ireland-style devaluation (and no Greece events), and in the future the charter could predict these sort of things.<p>That it turned into a call for political fusion of Europe is scary.

Because at least two of your examples are totally wrong.<p>Mexico&#x27;s revolution was in large part about wealth and land reform [1]; Zapata&#x27;s famous battle cry was &quot;tierra y libertad&quot;, land and freedom. Many of the reforms persists, albeit in weakened form, even today. China&#x27;s revolution is known as the Chinese <i>Communist</i> Revolution [2] for a reason. The spike in conspicuous inequality is so new in China that the newly rich quite literally need instruction on how to display their wealth [3].<p>I do think a revolution is unlikely to happen in the US any time soon, but that&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve got some tradition of taking care of people well enough that they&#x27;re mostly not desperate enough to start a shooting war with the cops. E.g., during the 2008 crash, we spent zillions of dollars propping up the economy until things got better. We also have enough issues with race that we may see a race war before a class war. But it&#x27;s a mistake to think it can&#x27;t happen here. If we&#x27;re ever dumb enough to pursue an austerity program like the one being inflicted upon Greece, where the interests of a small number of bankers are being hugely privileged over the great bulk of a nation, I would not be shocked at all to see something like Occupy Wall Street crossed with the Cliven Bundy crew.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/chinas-richest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gq.com/story/chinas-richest</a>",1436130151

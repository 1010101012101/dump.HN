I realize this is mostly anecdotal, but I find when I'm editing in vim or any good IDE, I can focus more on the algorithm and less on the act of typing, and a deeper focus on your program (i.e. data structures, control flow, etc) rather than on typing, does have an advantage.<p>Holding down the left or right arrow key while waiting for the cursor to move to the end of a line, or reaching for the end key is distracting and interrupts concentration, even if it is brief. Waiting for a cursor to move puts a greater strain on working memory because it means maintaining state information, in memory, for a longer period of time. While these distractions are somewhat minor for a single line of code, they really add up when you're' coding for 8 or 10 hours a day. In fact, I find these distractions add up to the point where I <i>need</i> to be editing in Vim or a good IDE to get in a state of flow.<p>Now, before someone calls me out on it, I'd also suggest that I don't believe using vim or an IDE increases the load on working short term memory. When you're initially starting out with a new tool, obviously it does increase the working load on memory, but once the key bindings are committed to muscle memory then, almost by definition, you're no relying on working memory.",1362188861

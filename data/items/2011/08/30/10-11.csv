It had more to do with the fact that actually managing a case like this would be a logistical nightmare.  Trying to corral thousands of pro se defendants would be completely absurd and the judge lists just how many problems they'd have to deal with.<p>Granted, those problems probably wouldn't happen because these cases are dropped the second they get discovery and have a list of names and addresses of alleged infringers to go after.  But they can't very well admit to the judge that the lawsuit was just a ploy to do discovery and run, so I'm interested to see if they'll do anything here.  Most likely, they'll give up on those folks and hope for a different judge next time.",1314699631

You can start reading open-access journals, but you cant stop reading the closed ones.<p>This is the only problem standing in the way of open access publishing. While the arXiv doesn't offer peer review and so doesn't negate the need for journals, the ecosystem would quickly adapt to open peer review. Unfortunately the implied reputation of being published in certain journals is still something that's too ingrained in academia.

Take some exit scenarios, eg 50M, 200M, 500M; what do you believe the most likely outcome to be for your company? How much more funding do you believe will be needed before a potential exit (dilution)? Not every company will exit, consider this when comparing offers.<p>Now, my personal view. If you're making $90k then $150k-$200k is a pretty big step up. Is it basically similar work but in a different company or do you have to put in a lot more hours?

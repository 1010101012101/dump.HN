Is he getting more attention? Is he getting to feel like a victim? Is he getting the right to feel sorry about himself? Is he able to justify his low grades?",1206421044
145445,comment,141898,141898,0,0,spongefrob,,,"You weren't meant to program computers either...<p>... nor, I daresay, were any of us meant for great wealth; which, as Graham may yet demonstrate, is just a much a corruptor of character and insight as poverty (if not more so...)  Just as large corporations tend to stifle, indeed put a halt to, the generation of ideas, so to does the imposition of large sums of money.  If that were not true,\nthen the startups trajectory wouldn't bend towards acquisition... (or, despite Grahams elisions, shall we call it 'surrender'? )<p>The whole point of evolution is to adapt and mutate and so there is no such thing as 'normal' or 'meant to.'  An interesting aspect of evolution is that we get to thumb our noses at the very idea of 'normal' and that we get to shrug off the very idea of 'meant to'.<p>Paul Graham has argued eloquently and succinctly this very line of reasoning heretofore.  It comes, thus, as a shock to read this essay, coming, as it does, from the programmer who advocates bottom up design in opposition to top down mandates.  Of course, the point of evolution often contrasts harshly with the point of cynicism: which is simply to justify any childishly satisfying, but nonetheless, foul mood or thought. Or, as Mencken put it, ``The cynic is the man who, when he   smells flowers, looks around for a coffin.''<p>So much of this essay strikes me as the worst form of 'sophistry at a distance' that I scarce can credit Graham as the author.  Surely some philosophy undergrad, still pink and slightly damp behind the ears, has stolen into Graham's study and slyly substituted his/her unfinished term paper for some valuable slice of Graham wisdom. Perhaps a wily hacker is having sport of Graham, and us, by subtly crafting an HTML parser that cleverly distorts, ever so slightly, essays fed to it...  The world waits, with held breath, for\nthe un-masking of the villain.",1206420970

There's a reason he's the only one that gets beat so much and so hard.<p>I agree with you on all but one point.  The solution is not to ""make Billy accept a big part of the responsibility"".  The solution is to put him in a different environment, one where his confidence is allowed to grow.  <i>Then</i>, after he feels better about himself, you could talk about what sort of behaviors are likely to attract bullying.  I get the feeling that if you told him that he was to blame for his bullying, he would just feel more oppressed.",1206420784

145437,comment,145245,145301,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The unfortunate thing about a 4 hour work day for traditional (read: non-technical) workers is that the advancement of technological tools allows them to accomplish the same amount of work in less time, meaning that if an individual (or entire company) wanted to get ahead, they would still use the entire 8 hours (arbitrary number. Many use even more) to accomplish much more work.<p>Technology hasn't shortened the amount of work we do, it has raised the standard for everyone to accomplish more.<p><i>This is mostly meant to apply to non-technical workers. People who deal with technology have a different and unique set of standards.</i>",1206420151

In a consumer markets, where how much you pay for housing determines the schooling of your kids, or the ""want"" for plasma tvs, nicer cars, more shiny things will make people work as much as they can.<p>The only way to enforce a 4 hrs work day will be thru law (goverment mandate not to work more than 4hrs a day, ala EU's 37.5 normal workweek),<p>Or, if something like that star trek machine that can create everything  (you press a button, and food just comes out from it, or any electronics/material need you need).\nThen people will be working only to teach, design new things, entertain, as material needs will be superflous.",1206420109

145434,comment,145245,145416,0,0,ardit33,,,"not gonna happen.  People Just wont trust it.  Just like mass trasport with ""flying cars"" are not going to happen this century.  High speed rail  (200+ mph), and smaller cars for city transport will prevail.  Wait until gas hits 6$/gallon, and then you will see the change on american attitudes to transport.<p>I remind you that the population density of USA is about 31/km²,  while europe's is about 112/km², and appart NYC, there are no really very dense areas in this country.  Even SF has about half of the density of the average European city.<p>So even if the population doubles in the next 50 years, current technology (or the model of life you see in Europe), will be enough.  Anything else too drastic, will probably be too expensive to develop.",1206419764

So, a goverment can actually achieve something good.   The thinking back then was so car centric, that even in intercity traveling you had to had a car.  Since cars would not be allowed into cities anyways (according to the prediction), wouldn't it made sense for trains?",1206419202

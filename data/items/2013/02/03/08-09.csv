If your job involves something new like Drupal then you get on and learn it, there are plenty of resources around. Perhaps novice Drupal developers are the problem.<p>Note, I do not like working with Drupal but I have seen some really impressive things done with it.<p>The author says Symfony is dying. The opposite is true. Symphony2 and it's components are becoming more popular and are being used in other frameworks like Laravel.

5159134,comment,5158837,5158837,8,0,ddellacosta,,,"I was a Drupal developer for a year or so.  That was at the end of my stint as a PHP developer, and presaged the end of my use of PHP as a language, and my introduction to the larger world of software engineering.<p>Thinking about it now, I'm really not sure what Drupal is good for.  All in all it is a pain-in-the-ass to work with.  Having switched to Rails after that (and please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to insist that Rails is the be-all-end-all, but for the sake of comparison...), I know now that the same amount of development time in Rails can yield far greater results, despite the fact that you can essentially build functionality through a GUI in Drupal--a GUI which is as incomprehensible as the codebase is.  This is something the author of this piece acknowledges when he talks about trying to customize Drupal.<p>This has to do with two things, I feel.  One is that, fundamentally, Ruby is a more expressive language than PHP, and you can accomplish a lot more with less code.  I say this not to start a language war but simply because I think it is true--the same way I feel that Lisp is more expressive than Ruby by a significant factor.<p>The second, and much more significant reason, is that Drupal doesn't have any sort of sane architecture to let you safely plug in modular code.  You are essentially hot-loading code into arbitrary points within the system.  Frankly, it suffers from the same problem a lot of PHP apps do (and more Ruby and Python apps than many of us would care to admit) which is that it's people re-inventing the wheel from the ground up, all over again, poorly.  The fact that they are now talking to the Symfony guys about putting some of those ideas in place suggest to me that someone on the Drupal team finally realized MVC exists.  I have this vision of someone in the PHP community at some point randomly picking up the Gang of Four book and being like ""holy shit, check this out people...they had a solution to some similar problems 20 years ago...""<p>I'm joking a bit...but after years and years doing web development, I only finally realized the whole world of software engineering that was out there, and how out of the loop I truly was (and still am).  Many developers exist in a little bubble consisting only of their language or worse, their platform.  The Javascript folks, Rubyists and Pythonistas (fill in your favorite language/platform here I suppose) can all suffer from this.<p>Point being, any of us who consider ourselves ""software engineers"" should be constantly reviewing our own skill set, and while we should certainly be refining our skills in our particular language(s) and toolsets of choice, we should also be constantly reviewing other languages and ways of thinking about architecting software for guidance, inspiration, and to combat our own tendencies towards small-mindedness.  We should be refining our knowledge of algorithms and comp sci fundamentals if we are lacking (as many web developers are, especially self-taught ones).<p>After all, ""those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.""  This is just as true--if not moreso--in software engineering as it is in any other discipline or domain.",1359881552

5159126,comment,5158936,5159071,3,0,derrida,,,"I think msvan may have been referring to books too. For instance: <i>Origin of the Species</i> spends a great deal of time presenting evidence for why evolution should be believed. At the time this was of course necessary to convince all of the skeptics. Now, it can be sort of dry. Dry as in ""not stimulating"". It's much more interesting to follow a book that deals with things that are controversial <i>today</i>. Reading Dawkins for instance is likely to push some buttons even in those who accept evolution. It's also arguable that this sort of thing isn't science, it's just philosophy (the idea of the Meme, for instance) and if it is philosophy, how can we separate the philosophical import of evolution from the science of evolution.<p>Yes, saying this is likely to rile up some Dawkins defenders, but then I've proven my point, the issues it discusses are not dry the way that pages and pages of evidence presented for an argument you already accept the conclusion of is.<p>But I shouldn't really speak, I barely read these days.",1359881429

Lo and behold, bandwidth costs dropped. The same goes for Dropbox- 2GB for <i>every user, for free?</i> Are you insane? But storage costs dropped and it's an affordable model.

5159107,comment,5158575,5158575,4,0,tzs,,,"I've been confused by Netflix's business strategy for a while. I'm not much of a business guy, so maybe I'm just missing something.<p>I've made do for movies with the channels that came along for the ride when I subscribed to the minimal cable TV package that got me the nerd channels (Science, Discovery, Nat Geo, History, and so on). I've got quite a backlog of movies I'm waiting for.<p>Recently, I caught a movie (How to Train Your Dragon) on TV that I liked so much that I simply had to go buy a copy on Blu Ray. This also necessitated buying a Blu Ray player. I picked a Blu Ray player that also plays streaming content from the internet and supports pretty much everything other than iTunes.<p>I then started researching the streaming services (both subscription and rental), seeing how well they covered the movies I'd seen in the last couple of months on TV (HTTYD, Star Trek, Kung Fu Panda, District 9, Watchmen, Shrek Forever After, Happy Feet, Tangled, Bolt, Despicable Me, Monsters vs. Aliens, Fargo, Fantastic Mr. Fox), as well as how well they covered movies still on my backlog, plus assorted movies I'd like to rewatch.<p>Here's what I found. Neither Amazon nor Netflix subscription streaming provided good coverage of the movies I'd recently seen, the movies on my backlog, or the movies I want to rewatch.<p>The streaming rental services were a bit better, but still missing a lot.<p>Netflix's disc subscription service, on the other hand, covered pretty much everything.<p>So here is where I get confused. Netflix seems to think their future is in their streaming subscription service. This seems to me to be a pretty risky basket to put all their eggs into, because it seems to me that Amazon will have an easier time fixing their weaknesses compared to Netflix than Netflix will have fixing their weaknesses compared to Amazon.<p>Amazon's weakness compared to Netflix is that Netflix apparently has more content (that's what people tell me, although for the movies I'm interested in they seem about the same). To fix that, Amazon just needs to make some licensing deals. They don't have to build out a lot of new infrastructure or enter a new line of business or anything like that. It's a ""write a check"" problem for them.<p>Netflix's weakness compared to Amazon is that Amazon subscription streaming is part of Amazon Prime--and there are good reasons to have Prime besides the streaming. I got it for the shipping savings, and I'm also enjoying the Kindle lending library. (Brick and mortar retailers, like Barnes and Noble, and Best Buy, seem to be doing their best to drive people to Amazon, and so I see Amazon Prime becoming more and more common--but this is best left for another rant).<p>This makes the question for a lot of people ""Netflix in addition to Prime?"" rather than ""Netflix or Prime?"". That's a much harder case for Netflix to make. As I said, for the movies I've checked there are very few on Netflix that are not on Prime--it would cost me less to simply rent those movies. As Amazon closes the gap on content, ""Prime plus rental"" will become a better choice than ""Prime plus Netflix"" for more and more people.<p>It seems to me that Netflix's best weapon against Amazon is their disc subscription service. It provides the most content (both recent and older). It provides the highest quality content. It provides extras (commentary, deleted scenes, and all the other nifty things that come on disc besides just the movie).<p>Yet Netflix treats their disc service almost as if it is an embarassment. There's no link on their main page for it. It only seems to be mentioned in their FAQ, where they imply that it is an add-on service to the streaming service, and give no link to details.",1359880867

5159104,comment,5158748,5158748,29,0,mdasen,,,"The issue we face isn't about predicting in broad-strokes technology that would be useful.  It's all the minute decisions that turn the broad-strokes into something great.<p>When something becomes popular, people often look for people who ""predicted"" it.  I remember the article about how Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold ""invented"" the iPhone in 1991.  Except that he didn't.  Microsoft made a hand-held computing OS before the iPhone and Palm Pilots existed a decade before the iPhone.  In broad-strokes, they're the same thing.  However, they weren't popular (and not for lack of trying).  The issue wasn't the broad-strokes, but the minute details that made the iPhone (and other devices since) a joy to use.  His work probably led to Windows CE, PocketPC, and Windows Mobile.  He didn't invent the iPhone.<p>Similarly, before Dropbox we had options like XDrive from AOL, WebDAV servers, FTP, iDrive from Apple, and many others.  We were awash with crappy software to store our documents on a server and access them from any computer we were on.  Even Microsoft offered a slew of sub-par options that would get re-done as a Dropbox competitor as everyone started recognizing that Dropbox's model was wonderful.<p>Giving David Gelernter credit for predicting Dropbox is to show a lack of appreciation for the decisions that made Dropbox great - and better than the army of options that came before it that simply weren't good.  Dropbox did what many before it couldn't do: create an online storage system that people love.  I remember trying a bunch of services like XDrive back in the day.  Transfers would fail, the transfers were synchronous (so you'd get a pause until the write had happened), things weren't cached locally so load times were poor, the mount was finicky, etc.  They all satisfied the ""making documents available everywhere"" criteria similar to Dropbox, but they simply weren't good.  Dropbox worked hard to make it good.  They made lots of little design/technical decisions that make it Just Work.  Many before them had tried and failed.",1359880725

In my experience, if you asserted that science did not aim for truth, most scientists would just roll their eyes and get back to work.<p><i>> Now I ask that you read the above quotation carefully and repeatedly until it sinks in.</i><p>Please, spare me!<p><i>> 1. All scientific theories must be falsifiable by new evidence.</i><p>Yes, that is true.<p><i>> 2. By definition, truths cannot be falsified.</i><p>Putative truths can certainly be falsified (or at least the sort that are falsifiable can be), and scientific theories are putative truths. Putative truths that turn out to be true, as it turns out will never be falsified, despite their falsifiability. Saying that a scientific theory can be falsified does not mean that we know it is false. It means that we can't know for certain that it is 100% true. But that is a far cry from the assertion that science does not aim for truth.<p><i>> 3. Therefore science cannot be a source of truth.</i><p>Nonsense. Just because we cannot know for sure that a scientific theory represents a true proposition, does not mean that it doesn't represent a true proposition. If a certain theory actually represents a true proposition, then it was a source of truth. Furthermore, scientific theories, even when they don't represent propositions that are 100% true do let us make true predictions.<p>For instance, we know that in some sense, Einstein's theory of gravity cannot in some sense represent a true proposition, but in every other respect, it is as true as any truth we have ever known. 100% of the predictions made by this theory of gravity have turned out to be TRUE. So to say that science cannot be a source of truth is utter nonsense. In this case, it has been an unerring source of truth, more true than anything else the world has ever known. Likewise for quantum mechanics.<p><i>> Which part of the above didn't you understand?</i><p>I understand it all, and what I understand is you are in the thrall of your own specious argument.<p><i>>This is not my notion, it is how science is defined -- see above.</i><p>There's no one definition of science.<p><i>> Ah. Now I see the problem. You don't understand what ""truth"" means. Truth is not an approximation, accurate or otherwise -- it is a superlative statement of fact.</i><p>That is not what ""truth"" means. You are asserting falsities with an air authority, nothing more.<p>A true <i>proposition</i> is a statement of fact. There are many other forms of truth, and multiple senses of the word ""true"". A compass can be true if it points you in the right direction. A clock can be true even when it is never perfectly accurate. A scientific theory can be true when it lets you build TV sets that work, or predict that a pencil will fall when dropped. ""True proposition"" is not the only meaning of true, and furthermore, even if you were going to apply only that definition of true to scientific theories, you have neglected that even ""false"" theories lets us construct many true propositions.<p>> Things that work are a form of truth.<p><i>> Confirmed -- you're using a private definition of ""truth"".</i><p>I most certainly am not. It is you who are. In fact, your notion of truth is utterly naive.<p><i>> People used willow bark to cure headaches for thousands of years before they had any idea why it worked. Is that truth? Yes, according to you.</i><p>Yes, it is true that willow bark cured headaches for thousands of years. Did it cure them 100% of the time? Of course not. Still, it is true that it cured them.<p><i>> Let's say I'm a quack doctor and I believe I have a cure for the common cold. My ""cure"", my ""truth"", is that I shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. My ""cure"" always works -- it might take several days, but it's perfectly reliable -- it's a ""truth"".</i><p>That is not true, because there is no correlation of cause and effect, other than perhaps due to the placebo effect, in which case that cure is true to the degree that the placebo effect is effective.<p><i>> Self-respecting college graduates know better than to try to offer their academic status as an argument in support of their views.</i><p>Nonsense. Credentials are useful or there would be no reason to ever get them.<p><i>>A college degree is as much a licence to be articulately wrong as articulately right.</i><p>Credentials of course don't guarantee correctness. But they often provide a reason to trust someone's opinion, or at least to pay attention.",1359880345

5159077,comment,5158837,5158837,6,0,neya,,,"Here's my experience on this one:<p>Actually, it's about using the wrong tool for the wrong purpose. I tried building a custom CMS with both Drupal AND Wordpress, just like the author and I realized how horrible it is build something custom out of an existing CMS.<p>I wanted to build a Metro-like interface for a shopping cart application with some extra functionality, just using Wordpress. Should be easy and was easy, until I discovered some horrible stuff within the code. You would think that Wordpress being so popular, would be top-notch as a development platform too. It was for the most part, but there were some trivial issues that made me develop a sense of hatred for developing for it.<p>No, I'm not talking about themes, I'm talking about building off something different using Wordpress as a base platform.<p>For example, on Wordpress, for pagination on posts, the GET variable is 'page' and for pages it is 'paged'. There is absolutely zero documentation on this and no reason as to why they have different (inconsistency) names for the same functionality. This is just one example. There were lots of other annoying bugs that pushed me too far. For example, sometimes, updating Wordpress would break a lot of plugins and leave you stranded.<p>Does this mean Wordpress is bad? No certainly not. It's the best blogging platform out there. But, if you want something custom, just build it yourself.<p>That's why I said 'fuck it' and moved on with rails. I get what I want, nothing more, nothing less. If I want an authentication system, there's Devise, if I want something else, there's always a gem for that, let alone writing my own code for the functionality I want isn't a big deal either.<p>In short, if you are building your start-up based off on an existing CMS, you're doing it wrong. Unless you are focused only on developing themes and frameworks for these platforms, or if you just want to run a Media company like Techcrunch or Mashable, just don't go with it.",1359880029

Similarly with some of the articles of John Carmack from idSoftware. For me the revelation was that there is indeed no such thing as ""style"" so that some techniques are just ""prettier"" than the others, it is all a matter of consequences a given implementation has for other developers using the code and for its maintainers.",1359879989

The women knew from the wolves on my shirt that I, like a wolf, am a mysterious loner who knows how to 'howl at the moon' from time to time (if you catch my drift!). The women that approached me wanted to know if I would be their boyfriend and/or give them money for something they called mehth. I told them no, because they didn't have enough teeth, and frankly a man with a wolf-shirt shouldn't settle for the first thing that comes to him.<p>I arrived at Wal-mart, mounted my courtesy-scooter (walking is such a drag!) sitting side saddle so that my wolves would show.

Mocking non-sequitur arguments repeating what they missed isn't throwing a hissy fit just because I'm not going out of my way to read the whole thread over and over, and your argument boils down to ""believing in Santa doesn't hurt anyone either"".

I took that literally, and told my baby brother I'd go to the toilet, thinking ""I will go to the kitchen instead"". When I left the room and he failed to cry, I was disappointed, I was already planning on using him as lie detector. You see, the fact that you shrug off the myth of Santa, the uttering of which would have been like crapping on the carpet for my family, just tells me we experienced and live in different worlds. And I couldn't care less about the additional credibility which the ""parent"" flag would give me, it's just not relevant; if I have kids they might turn out to be completely different persons who I was.

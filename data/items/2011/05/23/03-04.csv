Actually even the author of the post admits that SL has not failed.<p>B. The writer completely misses the point when comparing SL to a video game. The entire point of SL is that the users should be able to build the world. Yes, this results in less than ideal environments, yes if an engineer designed the world there would be less polygon popping, better cache utilization, better hidden loading times, etc., but you would get a video game. Not the crazy world that second life is.<p>From my very brief foray into it, I have to say that SL has completely succeeded in doing what it aimed to do. It has grown a very involved community and they have built their own world or worlds. And of course most of second life is beset by weird and bizarre things and people, but then again, if you think about it, that was to be expected.<p>The above being said, it is actually a very interesting technical problem to do the optimizations you usually expect in video games for a completely user designed world like Second Life.<p>In a video game when you have something seen from far away (for example a city seen as you approach by air) it is usually specifically hand designed by artists to be seen from far away. Once you come close, you will see what seems to be the same buildings but they will be different renderings designed to look good up close.<p>Of course Second life cannot do that because people create and break down buildings all the time, so they cannot have artists render the town from far away all the time.<p>But what could be done is to have an engine specifically blend details and combine polygons in a way similar to the way objects blend in distance as seen by the human eye. This would make both the world more realistic and the networking load lighter as fewer polygons need to be transferred.<p>This is an interesting possible improvement that SL does not do. But to the best of my knowledge no other computer game does it either, so you cannot blame SL for this.",1306122105

I was surprised to see that the author's comments in the submitted blog post were largely about the bandwidth limitations on Second Life's graphical representation of its virtual world shown to users, rather than about the community formed there. If people like a community well enough, they will put up with a pure text interface--as I have seen in my own experience.<p>So the blogger's noticing that Second Life's owners would rather make money with willing users who deal with the current interface than spend a lot of money to upgrade the interface makes sense.

2574856,comment,2574204,2574288,8,0,kragen,,,"I think JONESFORTH is awesome, I really enjoyed reading it, and I really appreciate you writing it, but there are a couple of points that could possibly be described as above, but maybe will sound a little less insane if described in full.<p> Your ROT originally was backwards. That is, rather than rotating the third element on the stack to the top, it pushed the top stack element down by two items, which is traditionally called -ROT.  While obviously this is a purely arbitrary convention, and irrelevant to just trying to explain how Forth works, it did create unnecessary confusion; it means that anybody who actually learned Forth from JONESFORTH would constantly be struggling to remember which way ROT worked.  I apologize for never properly reporting this to you.  You fixed this in <a href=""http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=commit;h=dccbff0e169d5467a78be5c6d935fa505f6a029f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=commit;h=dccbff0e...</a><p> The design of JONESFORTH (last time I read it) doesn't accommodate CREATE DOES>, which is the Forth way of creating functions that have state  closures, if you will, or objects with a single method.  This, by contrast, I think really is relevant to trying to explain how Forth works.  The techniques that support CREATE DOES> (ITC, DTC) are no more complex than JONESFORTH.<p>I think comp.lang.forth people were slamming JONESFORTH not because of anything about JONESFORTH but because they are mentally insane. (Although I can't really find the flames you were alluding to.  The worst I found is complaints about minor incompatibilities like the above.)",1306119870

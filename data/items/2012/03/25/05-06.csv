3751859,comment,3750684,3751126,5,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I agree with your sentiment. Gdel's work applies only to formal axiomatic systems of a specific strength. There are formal systems that are so weak they can prove their own truth and every statement is decidable (every true statement can be proved as true). And if your theory makes no claim to an axiomatic basis then Gdel really does not have jurisdiction.<p>But if a person accepts the Church Turing Thesis, then the human brain is not doing any computation that can't be modeled by a Turing Machine.  In fact, the brain is at least a Turing Machine. Gdel's limitations will apply to it.<p>If we accept the Church Turing Thesis and replace the brain with a Turing machine, I argue that the mind is a program that runs on that Turing machine. The program embodies a particular formal system sufficient to encode mathematical statements and leverage itself to prove statements. From this argument one can infer that there are some mathematical truths that some minds will not find. And that if each human mind represents a different formal system, it is in their best interest to work together.<p><i>Disclaimer - The above is me thinking out loud not something from a peer reviewed paper</i>",1332655133

That validator will see a different string than the syscall will; this is called null-character injection, and while it is difficult to craft effectively, it can lead to accessing resources that you thought you had protected by validating the string.<p>You are quite correct that nulls are not legal characters in POSIX filenames; however, that is irrelevant.

3751832,comment,3746692,3748095,2,0,kbolino,,,"In my experience, these are the problems with developing in MonoDevelop for Unity:<p>- The debugger is flaky.  Sometimes it will miss a breakpoint completely.  Sometimes trying to inspect local variables will crash MonoDevelop.  Sometimes it will refuse to continue no matter how many times you tell it to.<p>- If your problem starts in Unity's native code, forget about trying to debug it.  The messages are cryptic and the debugger is useless.  This happens for some things you can diagnose (like running out of memory, either on the machine or the card)--although good luck figuring out what your memory hog was--and for other things that leave you completely stumped (shotgun debugging becomes your only recourse).<p>- Don't even attempt to use text search over multiple files (other searches, like reference searches, work fine).  MonoDevelop will get stuck in an unproductive loop that never displays any results and never completes.<p>- Forget about profiling.  Unity technically has a profiler, but it's per-frame, not cumulative.  It also omits a lot of detail, especially about memory usage.<p>- There are also a number of minor issues, too, but they aren't deal breakers so much as annoyances.<p>That having been said, our particular project is rather good about pushing Unity to (and beyond) its limits, and you may never encounter any of these limitations.  Still, it's worth knowing that they exist.<p>Footnote: These comments may be limited to the version of MonoDevelop that ships with Unity 3.3 (there are non-technical reasons why it's not worth our time to go through the effort to upgrade).",1332653734

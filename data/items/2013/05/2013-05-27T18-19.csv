5775967,comment,5775165,5775579,12,0,scythe,,,"The biggest candidate:<p>* Pure mathematics: Consider e.g. the difficulty in verifying the recent proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (Wiles-Taylor-Frey theorem?), the Poincar conjecture (Perelman-Hamilton-Thurston theorem?), and now the ABC conjecture (Mochizuki-Szpiro theorem?): there is essentially <i>no indication</i> of the correctness of a mathematical proof besides simply having a whole lot of smart people look at it and think very hard. This may be of particular interest because pure math has lately experienced a turn towards the use of proof-verifying systems, and so it may be of some interest if one of these can be designed for cryptography.<p>In particular, consider the following method of verification: a cryptographically secure function h(M, k), known or at least believed to be hard, a message M, a secret key k, and a channel C(h) over which data is transmitted. We wish to prove the following combination of statements: a: given C and h, a method to obtain the message M also obtains the key k, and b: given M, C, and h, it is ""impossible"" to obtain the key k -- i.e. it would require breaking the hash function; this means that if the cryptography is broken, so must be the hash function. The latter portion of the proof is necessary because we must always consider the possibility of a rubber hose or a stupid user.<p>EDIT: I should add here that <i>side channel attacks</i> depend on an incorrect understanding of the content of C. So perhaps we should include c: we send only what we wish to in C.<p>In the interest of pedantry, I dreamed up an example ""cryptosystem"" which <i>may</i> fit the bill, though I have no honest idea of the difficulty of the h function [and I know almost nothing about cryptography!]: consider a large prime number p, the finite field F_p, and its algebraic closure Fbar_p. A message M is a [presumaly long] polynomial M(x) over Fbar_p, and a key consists of the pair k = [p, z], where z is some arbitrary element of Fbar_p. h(M, k) is obtained by expanding (x - z) * M(x) in Fbar_p, and we send over C the coefficients of the resulting polynomial. Verification is obtained by computing C(z) in Fbar_p and the message is extracted by polynomial division. Then (a) rests on the difficulty of factoring a polynomial and (b) rests on the secrecy of p: so we cannot, for example, simply compute C/M.<p>Note that Fbar_p is <i>countable</i>, so the whole procedure uses only integer math.",1369680632
5775966,comment,5775573,5775828,5,0,qzxt,,,"I second this! or something similar, at least. Having not really gone to college, myself, I was lucky enough to have had so many varied life experiences and interests before I took up tech; so when talking to my colleagues who are cs-equipped, I find their methodology is often very CS oriented, and focused more on the tech than on the problem. I think that's why ""design"" has become such a big fad these days - it's almost as if we just figured out that people buy products, not tech.<p>That being said, after speaking with quite a few tech-inclined people, I feel they would be a lot more comfortable with less technically inclined subjects if they were stripped of the general cultural pretensions that they come with. There is a very strong resistance to ""acculturation"" among techies, as it is usually seen - rightly, for the most part - as a mechanism of enforcing a ""cool kids' club"", so to speak, rather than an actual venue for intellectual exploration.<p>I think, that as techies, we are in a unique situation, as far as intellectual development is concerned.

The root kit is obviously an unrealistic idea though the network idea is a bit more realistic but I seriously doubt either will go anywhere.<p>This is our fault though. We have these companies that sell us digital recordings of media we want at a price they've chosen. We found a way to circumvent the buying process and get it free. This is simply not okay. We can debate how fair artists get treated, the price of media, and whether or not distributing copyrighted materials online is technically stealing all day long but in the end any rational person sees this is wrong.<p>So while we infringe on the copyright holders rights for years any time they try to take steps to curb this behavior (which is on a scale way larger than other types of black markets and impossible to ignore) we act shocked and appalled as if we've dont nothing to instigate it. Each time they fail to curb piracy they come back with an even more deplorable plan to stop it. In the end we're all losing, both the media companies and the consumers.<p>I still can't understand why anyone would think piracy is okay. I've done it myself but I know its wrong. Using reasons like region availability, pricing, and the usual copyright complaints to justify it dont make sense. They're usually all excuses for the person with ""I should be able to get this on my terms because, uhh, freedom"" syndrome.<p>Sometimes the complaints are legitimate but still don't excuse piracy. We've created this problem ourselves and the only way to stop it is to vote with our wallets. Piracy does not count as voting with your wallet. To vote with your wallet you have to be willing to live without the thing you desire or go to a competitor until the seller starts giving the consumer what they want. A black market is not a competitor and it undermines the goal of getting media companies to start making it convenient to buy their product at a reasonable price. Piracy just shows them we want what they've got but don't want to pay. The only way to compete with piracy is to shut it down which is impossible and leads us to crazy proposals like the one discussed here. But lets say HBO and Shotime both aired Game of Thrones. If HBO sucks at distribution and pricing consumers go to Shotime instead. HBO sees this and can't shut down Shotime so the solution is to get better at pleasing consumers.<p>My point is that you can't compete with a black market and this constant arms race to implement and circumvent anti-piracy measures will lead to a stalemate where we all lose. If we quit both pirating media <i>and</i> buying it, that would start leading to changes in a positive direction (for those of us who aren't just pirating to be cheap at least).<p>*Side note: unfortunately, getting media online has the potential to become VERY convenient but can never be as convenient as piracy as it'll always require a payment step but is that really so awful?",1369680496

5775920,comment,5773909,5773909,7,0,gmays,,,"First off, I didn't watch the whole thing, I got sick of it.  So, my comments aren't necessarily about the documentary, but to provide some perspective.  The below are notes I took while reading in no particular order, so the argument is a bit disjointed.  I spent a year as an embedded advisor in Afghanistan and just returned last month.  Prior to that I was in Iraq for a year as an advisor in 2009.<p>Despite my feelings for the documentary, I commend the crew for the work they did.  They did the best they could to report what they saw.  However, they let preconceived notions and a minute slice of experience significantly influence their perspective.  This is inevitable to some extent, but incredibly dangerous in this case.  When it happens with a small news story, not such a big deal.  But 99.9% of the population has no experience or knowledge on Afghanistan so their opinions and everything they know is based on what they read (yeah right) and what they watch (the preponderance).  This gives those who report on Afghanistan great power, but also great responsibility.  We can only hope those who consume this swill are more than sheep.<p>-There are ANP units of all levels of competency.  The one we were with was stellar.  Sure, others we worked with left much to be desired, but it wasnt the norm. At times units farther away from the 'flagpole' have less supervision and fewer resources.  They resort to what they're used to and what they need to do to survive, which is expected.  Lord of the flies anyone?  People tend to act that way in such environments, even in the US.<p>-The documentary was disappointing because it sought to show the Afghans in a bad light.  It was unbalanced and failed to explain some of the cultural reasons behind some of the examples.  Their culture is fundamentally different from ours and they do the best they can to survive in that environment.  Service members are there for between 7-12 months, it's a sprint for us.  Theyve been there and will be there for the long haul.  In their past, how many nations have come and gone?  What does such turmoil do to a culture, a nation, and its people?<p>-There is a significant focus on drug use, which is somewhat missing the point.  How prevalent is drug use in the United States?  If the US had the history of Afghanistan with a fledgling government and security forces, would it be any different?  Our culture sees drug use differently than theirs.  Our alcohol is their weed.  Should a professional force be under the effects of substances while on duty?  No, but lets talk more about why things are the way they are.  As the force professionalizes, these things will improve.<p>-Sangin, the region in most of the filming, is one of the worst parts of Afghanistan.  What if we made a documentary about the worst parts of the US?  The ghettos and slums, homeless, murders, drug use, etc. and named it This is what America looks like.  The US documentaries on these issues pale in comparison to all of the positive coverage.  All we see about Afghanistan are the shitty things.  Not the progress, not the new schools or education, not the hard working people.  When we do, its drowned out by the bad stuff.<p>-The same goes for corruption.  We can't help but see corruption through our Western lens, but it's seen differently in Afghanistan.  Think about how an Afghan documentary would talk about US alcohol consumption, fashion, sex, and other aspects of our culture?  It'd probably sound quite similar.  Its almost impossible to think of it differently because weve had the luxury of structure, strong government, order, etc. in the land of plenty.<p>-I'm not an expert in Afghanistan, but the perspective in this documentary is unfair.  Sure, some advisor teams were embedded with subpar units lead by completely corrupt, uninvolved commanders but this is not a representation of units or the government as a whole.<p>-Why does this documentary point out every wrong thing the Afghans do in the course of their day?  What about the good things?  I'm sure if I held a camera on any of us all day it'd be easy to pick us apart.  It's an easy thing to do when you havent been the one struggling.<p>-During the year our Afghans made significant progress.  They wanted to get better and they did.  Now they have their own sustainable training programs and they're getting better all the time.  Are they perfect?  No.  Do they still make mistakes?  Yes.<p>-What was this documentary actually trying to achieve?  The reporter is from the UK, what about the UK's history in Afghanistan.  Let's talk about their losses in Afghanistan and the general sentiment towards Afghans.  After spending some time at the MOB in Lashkar Gah, it's quite disappointing to see how Afghans (even our interpreters) are treated at times by British military personnel.  Let's get a crew and film that.  Are the UK forces bad?  Not at all, theyre great, theyre our brothers and we rely heavily on each other. But if youre filming 24/7 its easy to point out every time someone stumbles, because we all do it.  At the very least, acknowledge your biases as a source of news.<p>-This documentary is one-sided.  The unfortunate thing is that most people look for things that validate their existing arguments.  I can only imagine the countless people nodding their heads watching the documentary who can't even find Afghanistan on a map and who've learned everything they know about Afghanistan through the news or shit documentaries like this.<p>Im not an expert on Afghanistan and I am speaking from my experiences with multiple Afghan units from all pillars.  In my time there I worked with units in Helmand and Nimroz provinces and spent some time in Kabul.<p>Is Afghanistan doomed?  I dont know.  But I do know that encouraging negative sentiment based on minimal experience doesnt help and its a betrayal of the trust people put in those who deliver their news.  Its also a disservice to every service member whos spent time or gave their lives to make it work.  We all do the best we can, but our best correlates with whats on the line.  When youre responsible for shaping opinions on significant issues like this, you need to do a better job of being balanced.  Maybe Im off here because I never watch the news and maybe this is the norm, but its disappointing nonetheless.<p>For more context on the Afghan people see this my post in this thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5557881"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5557881</a>  It's about interpreters in Afghanistan.

This feature existed on vWorker, but not Freelancer.<p>As professionals, we want to be rated and visible based on delivering quality work on time and on budget and making our clients happy.  On vWorker, ranking/visibility was based entirely on revenue x client rating, with a bonus ""top worker"" designation for never missing a deadline or having a bad rating.  On Freelancer, we level up by following you on social media, get badges for logging in every day for a year, and generally get ranked according to tangential criteria.  It's distracting, and appears unprofessional to clients who are being asked to ""level up"" and ""earn badges"" themselves when all they want to do is hire us.<p>As professionals, we don't bid until we've already come to terms with the client.  On vWorker, we'd regularly have dozens of messages with clients establishing the details of a project, discussing timelines, etc. and then we'd put in a bid with that full understanding.  Freelancer seems geared toward submitting a large number of bids without having ever really discussed terms -- the sort of thing that might work for ""transcribe a 10 minute audio clip"", but not for projects measured in months and costing $x0,000 to complete.<p>As professionals, we want to pay our $50 monthly fee and our 2% per-contract cut, use the site to connect with clients with real large-scale contracts, and get paid on a reasonable timescale.

That advice isn't practical for developers. There are plenty of systems we have to design where crypto is not optional. Examples:<p>* Storing passwords. You can't store them in plaintext.<p>* Signing requests (like in the OP's example). What are the alternatives? You can store some kind of authentication in the cookie, which then gets sent with each request. You can use HTTP auth. But in any scenario, you're definitely using SSL, and you're probably using some other kind of crypto on top of that.<p>* Encrypting cookies. You should store as little as possible in cookies--ideally just a single identifier. But even so, it's very important to make cookies tamper-resistant. You can't, e.g. just have a plaintext cookie that says ""userid=42.""<p>So what does the OP propose we do?

I think you're correct. As I understand it, one can not legally protect a page layout. (Imagine how difficult it would be to publish a book if people could protect things like ""black times roman typeface on white background with one inch borders."") The description of a layout to a computer can be copyrighted as a form of expression, so one can copyright their specific CSS description of a page layout. It's interesting to note that the benefits of even this form of copyright protection is contentious: If a layout can only practically be expressed to the computer in a few different ways, then the odds of accidental infringement are very high.",1369679152

There your claims of a ""mix"" seem to be not correct.<p>They do. The 'tribal regions' are known 'tribal' for a reason. They are dominated by tribes, who have there own traditions & rivalry. They have affiliations with Taliban because of Pashtun traditions. This affiliation goes back even before the Pakistan came into being. Islam is a cultural part of this region but not the sole driving force. They used poppy/heroine for ages but Islam strictly prohibits using drugs. So yet another sample where your nice little narrative doesn't fit.<p>> Further, much of the problem the US has had with Pakistan is from the strong role of Islam there and in Afghanistan<p>erm ..US played an important role during the Afghan-Russia war. They actually pumped up the Jihadist sentiment at that time. Religion in the grand scheme has just been a tool to achieve interest.<p>> For reasons of religion, culture, domestic politics, and foreign policy, Pakistan has been mostly on the side of the Taliban, that is, wants to dominate Afghanistan.<p>Only foreign policy. Pakistan cannot afford to fight with neighbors on both sides of border. That's the sole reason Pakistan wants to friend whoever comes into power in Afghanistan (apparently the notorious double-game Pak army has been playing with US is because once US goes back they would have to deal with Taliban ..and they want to be in there good books).
Pakistan has also been super-friendly with China but no religion, culture, domestic politics play any role in that. It's only foreign policy.<p>> My comments about Islam were focused on Afghanistan. The comments also apply a lot to Iran and Iraq<p>You do know Iraq fought war with Saudia Arabia ..the be and end all of all things Islam ? You do know how things were in Iran before the revolution ? If you start looking things from an economics-perspective then everything fits in place. There are some nut-jobs who leave everything to go and fight for the sake of religion but the majority of the population doesn't do that. They just want good food and good living style regardless of whose in power. Iranian revolution can be traced back to that as well.<p>> But the main reason for the formation of Pakistan was just Islam -- they wanted an Islamic country. Net, the main culture in Pakistan is just Islam.<p>then how come there hasn't been any Islamic governing system in Pakistan since the creation? There are gazillion open things in this country which are against the very premise of Islam yet no one talks about that. Pakistan wasn't created by an imam or cleric. The most ironic thing (and I would suggest you should go and study that) is that creation of Pakistan was opposed by virtually every single cleric at that time. Founder of Pakistan (Jinnah) lead a very secular life & wasn't a fan-favourite of Islamic imams at that time. Pakistan was created because Muslims were living a second-class life in all of India. Again economic reasons.<p>> The main interest in this tread is what the heck is the US going to do about Afghanistan and why? The main content of why is just the role of Islam.<p>That I agree. But that is not something which you can use as a reason to justify how things work in every Muslim country out there. US invaded Afghanistan at a time when they had right-wing extremists in power. So obviously they'll have to deal with problems in the same domain. You don't need to create grand conclusions out of it.",1369678345

5775762,comment,5774714,5775171,6,0,IvoDankolov,,,"Yes, you are missing something, which is a bit of a quirk of C++. Normally, having two functions with the same signature in a parent and child class results in overloading.<p><pre><code>  struct A 
  {
      void f() {std::cout << ""A"";}
  };

  struct B : A
  {
      void f() {std::cout << ""B"";} 
  };
  //.,...
  A a = B();
  B b = B();
  a.f();
  b.f();
  b.A::f();
</code></pre>
This would print ABA, as the child's f() function simply hides the parent one when working in the context of B(), but it does not override it.<p>Now, what virtual does is it tells the compiler, ""from here on out, resolve clashing signatures for this function in child classes by overriding. I'm sure you know how our example changes when you mark f() as virtual.<p>That's all old news, though. The more interesting bit, final, acts like so: from here on out, prevent overloading in child classes. Now, that only makes sense in the context of virtual, so that's the only place where you're allowed to use final, and here the actual difference to the first example becomes apparent. You see, final does not negate virtual, what it actually does is completely lock up the function signature from being used in any child classes. Adding virtual final to our example would not cause B's function to hide A's - it will simply not compile.<p>If you think that's all pointless semantics, you are absolutely right. Locking up names is not the point of ""final"". In fact, declaring something as virtual final in the base class is completely pointless from any practical standpoint. The actual problem that final is meant to solve is this:<p>As I mentioned earlier, virtual changes the way resolving names works in child classes forever. These two pieces of code are absolutely equivalent.<p><pre><code>  struct A 
  {
      virtual void f() {std::cout << ""A"";}
  };

  struct B : A
  {
      void f() {std::cout << ""B"";}

  {
      virtual void f() {std::cout << ""A"";}
  };

  struct B : A
  {
     virtual void f() {std::cout << ""B"";} 
  };
</code></pre>
Therein lies an interesting dilemma. What if I wanted to prevent any child class of B, and only B, from changing the implementation of f. Under C++03, that is not possible. In C++11, final solves that.<p>But why go through the trouble of introducing a new keyword - and a keyword that is only a keyword in class and function declarations to boot (Holy context dependent grammar, Batman!) - and not just drop the virtual qualifier? Backwards compatibility - ever a dreaded thing when you wish you could undo your old mistakes.<p>It isn't all that big of a deal (said the C++ developer about every strange rule in the language, ever), though, since when you use ""final"" for the intended purpose, you won't actually be needing the virtual qualifier.<p><pre><code>  struct A 
  {
      virtual void f() {std::cout << ""A"";}
  };
  
  struct B : A
  {
      void f() final {std::cout << ""B"";}

They go from provincial village to village, effectively saying ""Hey, nice village you have here...it would be a shame if something were to happen to it""<p>They do provide legitimate protection. If bandits or unsavory characters harass the village, the taliban will roll up with AKs and rpgs. They also adjudicate local disputes like ""he stole my goat"" or ""he had sex with my daughter"". The afghan military and police forces don't spend a lot of time in the poorest regions of the country, so it's usually the taliban that has to make someone give back the goat or marry the daughter.<p>In return for protection and dispute resolution, the people in poor afghan villages usually grow poppy on their lands to be sold as opium and volunteer military aged males as taliban recruits. When you think of this system at scale, running unchecked, you can see how 9/11 style acts of terrorism happen. The bigger threat is that a well resourced and uncontrolled taliban in Afghanistan could destabilize the whole region by inciting muslim conflicts.<p>The US response was close to being appropriate for disrupting a protection racket. In the near term, they sent marines to provide protection for poor villages and actively hunt the taliban. In the long term they tried to introduce free democracy to the country, to provide security and rule of law to the poorest people and put the taliban out of business.<p>The reason it's taken so long to produce results is optimism on the part of western politicians. Afghanistan is a country that's only loosely held together and there are many factions and families in Kabul competing to grab power in a newly formed government. It could still be decades before things are settled enough that they have time to worry about protecting their poorest citizens, and a strong taliban doesn't pose a direct threat to the most lucrative parts of the government.<p>It's a complicated situation mostly because the taliban is exploiting people who have little to offer to the government that is supposed to protect them. But many democracies start out this way, and ultimately western action may have helped the situation.",1369677617

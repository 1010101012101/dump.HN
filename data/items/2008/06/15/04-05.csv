So it's not like they should have a problem putting it in their cars.<p>Those are some cool bugs though...<p>If you could break down sewage like that, you could link them up with an RV's toilet or people's drainage fields and let them pump their own shit into their gas tanks.

Still, the JVM and VMs in general are good for dynamic language implementations.<p>Javascript/Rhino is better than you think, and among the best of the JVM languages -- better than Java, and still easy to integrate with Java in both directions. Rhino is getting investment from Google and elsewhere; remaining objections will be conquered.<p>Google will open-source 'Rhino's not Ruby' (aka 'Rhino on Rails') this year (he hopes). RnR has been used by a 20-developer team there to build a huge web app in a small code footprint. Google's JSCompiler for compressing JS will likely be open-sourced, too.",1213503670

They'd load for some amount of time and then hang.<p>The way he diagnosed it was to do a transfer of /dev/zero out one link. It worked. But it stopped almost immediately out the problem link. It turned out to be the same problem -- no zero bit stuffing configured on the line.<p>By the way, this same technique, known as ""weak bits"", was used as a floppy and CD/DVD copy protection scheme.",1351483185

Look at a game like Minecraft, there is 0 ability to share your stuff ""officially"" so people went to Youtube and created a hundred million dollar business. A game called Happy Wheels: same deal.

As you have rightly stated, there is no deception or forced participation. It's a free market.<p>What I <i>don't</i> think a lot of 99designs customers consider is their impact on the health of the design market. Allow me to illustrate this in the software development world:<p>...<p>Imagine you have a potential client that has put out an RFQ. You write up a proposal and submit it. You are not selected, but you learn that the potential client went instead with an offshore company that bid literally one third of your bid. There was no way you would have come close.<p>You may say ""I build quality software. I charge what that's worth."" The offshore competitor may write less efficient code that's much harder to maintain but this client doesn't know, or care. They care that the software meets requirements and was delivered on-time and in-budget.<p>That's what designers who disagree with 99designs are concerned about clients that don't understand what they're missing out on when they choose a one-off crowdsourcing instead of a collaborative, iterative process  and a market that comes to accept this as the norm.<p>Now maybe for a one-off side project, you simply don't need a full design process for a logo. Maybe a client that needs a quick prototype for an app doesn't need the quality codebase you can provide. I'm not against either of these scenarios.

Similarly, I don't see how it represents a lack of care for the designer on the line, seeing as to how numerous designers happily use the site themselves.<p>You say that your problem is not the amount of money, but with the concept of spec work -- ""doing work for nothing."" And to that I reply that I totally agree. Doing work for nothing <i>is</i> a problem. But you're blaming the wrong person. You should blame the people who choose to do that work, not the people who offer to buy it. Designers are perfectly capable of saying, ""No, I don't like doing work that will possibly be for nothing, therefore I won't participate in 99designs."" Nobody is holding a gun to any designers' heads and forcing them to apply this questionable business model to their work.<p>You could argue that it's still unethical on the part of the client, because they're taking advantage of ignorant designers who are unaware that they are entering into an (arguably) bad deal. But that line of reasoning doesn't hold water, because 99designs makes it very clear what the arrangement is. Nobody here is unaware of the risks of doing competitive spec work.<p>You could also argue that the problem isn't with the designers who participate in spec work, but with how their decision affects the market for desginers who <i>don't</i> want to do that. But if a large number of designers can be persuaded into doing spec work, then some combination of the following facts are true: (a) there are too many designers, (b) there are too few people requesting high quality design. In either case, it means simply designers may not be worth as much as you think they are, in the numbers you think they should be. I hardly think you can call someone's morals into question for not choosing to donate extra money to designers.",1351482135

Usually as part of an angry rant.<p>It's a common theme for most industries to want to control who is in it, how they buy and how much they pay.  The whole retrospectively-name mercantilist period of economics lasted for centuries, and collectively reduced the living standards of millions, just because those in charge thought setting prices and reducing access to industries was a good thing.  It wasn't until markets were opened up and anyone could enter or leave at will that things improved for many, many people.<p>The point is - you either agree with free markets for anything or you don't.  It's hard to accept that it's OK for you to buy cheaper goods caused by some industry disruption somewhere else, but it shouldn't apply to your own industry.    It's hard to accept, but you still have to.<p>Commoditization of products and services happens, and if it happens to you, you've just to got to suck it up and get on with it.  Hectoring or whinging to your clients is a no-win strategy.  Doubtless many restaurants have been killed by McDonalds and low-cost, low-quality meals, but the public vote with their feet and dollars.<p>In the case of 99 designs, most of the designs are below the floor level of the cost of engaging a designer.  If I were a designer, I would hope that 99 designs provides a gateway to people using more design services, rather than doing without  or (worse) doing it themselves, which is the far-more frequent outcome.<p>In the case of new companies (like stackoverflow once was) it makes a lot of sense to just get a little bit done in order to get launched.

I had no way of communicating with my friends who were all using cellphones and IM, so I just talked to them at school if I saw them. If I wanted to play video games, I went to the arcade, and since I had no car, it was always a fun adventure getting there and back. From the perspective of others, I was becoming an outcast. From my new perspective, they were the outcasts - out of touch with themselves, mindless robots in an artificial reality.<p>I spent my time reading books, writing my thoughts down, sketching ideas, taking walks, observing humans and nature, introspecting, and developing my personal philosophy and plans for the future.<p>Eventually I grew out of the phase, bought a bunch of new stuff, including a new computer, and got addicted to the Internet harder than ever. It led to a lot of great things - getting better at programming, participating in a bunch of online communities, making money, sharing my work and thoughts, and finding inspiration from others. However, there is always a nagging feeling that my younger self is questioning my lifestyle.<p>No matter how far in the zone I am, how much effort I take to remove the distractions from my environment, how secluded a place I go to get away from it all - I cannot reach the level of clarity and the perspective from those days. Just knowing that sweet feeling that awaits once I am jacked into a live connection again, and hit the browser tab, is enough.<p>The crux is not a culture of distraction - it is that our culture, especially our technology, is too heavily skewed towards consumption over creation. To make full use of our humanity, we need to be able to take the time to look inside ourselves - we need to allow ourselves to be distracted from within. The Internet by nature creates connections outwards - perhaps balance can be restored by finding its inverse. An Intronet<i>?<p></i> A computer, much like paper and other creative mediums, is an impressive tool for exploring and expressing the inner self. An Intronet may actually be a cultural shift in computing rather than a technological development.",1351480869

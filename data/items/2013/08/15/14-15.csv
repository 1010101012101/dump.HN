6218175,comment,6217623,6217623,12,0,flumbaps,,,"This is really stupid. You don&#x27;t have to be sociopathic to disregard convention and think things through for yourself. Much better to seek enlightenment and self awareness, and then make rational choices about which emotions you indulge and which you discard. Disregarding all empathy is only useful for obtaining material things, the desire for which is itself irrational and self-defeating for non-sociopaths.<p>To give an example, I personally don&#x27;t say prepared anecdotes and eat extra food at parties. I have fun at parties and engage people in enjoyable conversations. When I meet new people I&#x27;m warm and friendly and I make an effort to form genuine connections. As a consequence, people like me and I have close friends who love me and enjoy my company. You can&#x27;t look at all the fun and laughter and human warmth I have in my life and tell me I should trade it all in for some snack food and a more calculated image. That is completely stupid. Only someone who cannot enjoy human company should think like that, and those people should be pitied not admired.",1376578754

6218167,comment,6217536,6217536,12,0,davidjgraph,,,"If you mostly export (i.e sell abroad), there are some additional considerations for picking a payment provider (I speak from the point of view of a UK company).<p>We&#x27;ve been using Shareit for selling software for many, many years and it&#x27;s basically 4.9% as fees. The first interesting part for me is the currency conversion rate. We operate in GBP and all of our sales last month were in USD. Working out the average rate we got 1.54 USD to 1 GBP. Looking at the exchange rates for July [0] that seems reasonably close to the mid market rate.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know how Stripe determine their conversion rates. If it&#x27;s mid-market then we&#x27;re looking at 4.4% against 4.9%.<p>The next issue when exporting is whether you have to register formally in the country you&#x27;re selling to in order to avoid withholding taxes [1]<p>The countries we&#x27;ve come up against this to date are the USA, Portugal and India. The volume we do with the US justifies registering with the IRS and making a W8-BEN form available to all companies we sell to.<p>The process for the US is doable and the volume we sell there easily justifies it. The process for Portugal is awful and the process for India comprises about 6-8 weeks of utter bureaucratic bullshit [2]. The sales volume from these countries were not worth going through the process.<p>If we didn&#x27;t go through this process and sell directly in these countries the buyer would have to withhold a proportion of the purchase, usually around 20%.<p>Shareit is an actual reseller, legally. Stripe isn&#x27;t, AFAIK. So, Shareit can deal with the admin in these countries and pass over the same amount they do as for any country. A few years ago, we hadn&#x27;t heard of withholding taxes, it&#x27;s becoming more and more common as countries try to clamp down on tax evasion.<p>It&#x27;s more strictly enforced the larger the payment amount gets, but my point is to be aware of the legal differences in payment processing services regarding foreign withholding tax rules.<p>Edit : There&#x27;s actually a third issue as well and that&#x27;s whether your insurance covers you to take card information on your site (up to details regarding the type of SSL certificate you have installed) and, if it does, whether you comply with all the security constraints the policy imposes. You may find that the additional premium is more than the cost savings.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&to=USD&view=1Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&to=USD&view=1Y</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withholding_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withholding_tax</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dallaway/pan-card-uk-company.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dallaway/pan-card-uk-company.ht...</a>",1376578698

6218157,comment,6217527,6217558,1,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"I managed a software dev team this way - by outcomes. It worked great - at least from a developer productivity perspective. I knew my devs, knew who worked steadily and who worked according to a Dirac delta function (one guy was particularly spiky and narrow, and he could cobble together library code like nobody else) and who were in-between, and knew how to manage them and what to task each with.<p>(FYI, RP, &quot;spiky and narrow&quot;, was &quot;I need this at the end of the day&quot;; XY was &quot;disappear for a week, come back with what I asked for and a mind-blowing +1 we couldn&#x27;t have predicted&quot;; CC was &quot;disappear for two weeks and return with the most beautifully architected, extensible, factory-based systems that were rock solid, customer ready, no costly bugs, ever&quot;.)<p>Where it didn&#x27;t work so well? We were part of a PS shop, with billability targets and revenue expectations. It took some finesse to map the above behaviours to billable hours. My boss was tacitly on-board (he knew the personalities of my team, didn&#x27;t ask how I managed them, and appreciated the results) but his boss, our VP, didn&#x27;t know and it would have been dangerous for him to know.<p>So there are risks involved.<p>When my boss moved within the company, I followed him, RP followed me, and we did amazing things in an environment where that management style could be public knowledge (we were out of PS and out of billable revenue days and into a SaaS/SoA sort of thing, basically priced by value to the customer, before those were buzzy).<p>Hmm, there may be some information leakage in this post - but RP, XY, and CC know who they are.

For many others, it&#x27;s not (e.g. Netflix, Heroku).<p>I see a false dichotomy here: start off with the cloud, then move to bare metal servers. If you&#x27;ve got an OLTP database that demands high-performance, you may need bare metal. Many companies don&#x27;t, though.<p>I&#x27;ve been a consultant to companies who&#x27;ve over-extended themselves on EC2 and ended up with huge monthly bills they didn&#x27;t anticipate; in every instance, it was because they hand-built servers, cloned them, and then hand-modified them. The result was a set of servers they would <i>like</i> to be able to destroy (when they didn&#x27;t need them) and then respawn (when they did), but couldn&#x27;t because of the modifications. So, yeah, you can get in trouble with cloud services. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t use it cost-effectively on a permanent basis. Like anything else, it requires planning.<p>Switching to bare metal? Sure: as hypervisors to your private cloud.

6218151,comment,6215972,6216972,4,0,briandear,,,"I&#x27;m curious. What maps and cloud services providers have been shut out of iOS? I recall that google maps has an app, dropbox has an app, there are even non iTunes music players. One of the criteria for the app store doesn&#x27;t seem to be &quot;can&#x27;t compete with Apple.&quot; So this little diatribe about &quot;wrecking the industry&quot; is a bit unfounded. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you or anyone else from creating their own OS and their own hardware to run it on and marketing it to people and selling it.<p>Dropbox is a huge competitor to Apple&#x27;s cloud services. While they&#x27;re different, if Apple really was trying to be heavy handed, Dropbox would never have gotten on the App Store. By the way, what&#x27;s the default maps application on Android? Google is a model of openness right? So open that your gmail has &quot;no expectation of privacy.&quot; I wonder how they feel about things being done using an Android device. After all, if even your private person-to-person emails have no privacy expectation, then what expectation would one have for using an Android device?<p>As far as &quot;wrecking the industry,&quot; I&#x27;ve never made more money from development as I have since the App store came along. So unless your industry is creating malware or porn apps, iOS has hardly wrecked anything. If it weren&#x27;t for iOS, there&#x27;d likely be no Android. Apple essentially created the smartphone industry, at least as we know it today. Entire new businesses were created because of the App Store. I can&#x27;t even on one hand the number of consumer mobile development companies that existed before iPhone. I&#x27;m sure there were plenty, but hardly the billion dollar industry it is today.<p>I&#x27;m not an Apple apologist, however when I see the same tired arguments about the &quot;closed&quot; ecosystem it gets frustrating. Especially since the App Store has over 900,000 apps. That&#x27;s a lot of apps for such an oppressive system. A large percentage of them are crap, but comparing sales numbers to Google Play, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Apple is doing something right, at least from the perspective of the consumer -- which is the market. There are some notable screwups with the app approval process, however weighing that in the aggregate against the overall success of developers within the App store, the screwups are a drop in the bucket.",1376578579

6218129,comment,6217162,6217504,1,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,"Humans are notoriously bad at generating random numbers. [1] Very random strings are described by very complex programs.<p>The human mind, taken as an algorithm, might prefer short programs that are fast to execute and require little energy to run.<p>Vitanyi proved that highly random strings must include repetition and patterns. Very crudely (and because I don&#x27;t quite get all the maths):<p>A string-generating program is more random when its output is less predictable. If you don&#x27;t have to worry about predicting patterns and repetitions, this makes the rest of the program output more predictable. Thus, highly random generators should output patterns and repetitions too.<p>So, if we take the lottery numbers to be randomly generated (this is important), we must expect patterns like 1111111111 too.<p>We can approach Kolmogorov complexity (not computable) through compression. Basic Run-Length Encoding (RLE) of 1111111111 gives us (10,1). This is a very short and simple program and it seems that humans prefer such programs over more complex ones.<p>If we don&#x27;t want to share the lottery with people who look for patterns in previous draws, we should generate a string, that, when added to the previous draws and compressed produces the longest output.<p>Let&#x27;s say the previous two draws were 1111111111 and 22222222222, or compressed with RLE (10,1),(10,2). Humans who will optimize for patterns will produce strings that result in a shorter size. Let&#x27;s say some humans play the numbers of latest draw (222222222). That will result in a compressed string of all 3 draws: (10,1),(20,2). This has the exact same length as the compressed string of only 2 draws. The previous draws and the prediction share patterns that allow the compressor to produce smaller strings.<p>Optimizing for maximum complexity would have you pick a draw like &quot;2453160798&quot; (not possible to compress with RLE). A string like &quot;1234567890&quot; also does not compress with RLE, but it easy to spot the simple, short program generating it (n+1..).<p>What happens when some humans increasingly pick numbers that appear random, but in fact are very short programs or carry cultural relevance (a range starting at _n_th decimal of Pi, validation key of pirated windows XP, dates of birth of my first two children, my lucky 100-digit number).<p>If our compression algorithms were perfect they would be able to generate the shortest program that describes another, bigger (or equal size) string. But compression is not perfect. Most compression algo&#x27;s would struggle to compress a range of decimals of pi at n, as something smaller than a completely random number string. There is a simple pattern, but it won&#x27;t be found in a reasonable time.<p>Luckily we can use search engine indexes as our compression algorithm! If a string like &quot;12345&quot; has 1 million hits and string &quot;67890&quot; has 1 million hits and both strings together have 500k hits, we can say that these strings often co-occur (probably in the form 1234567890).<p>If a certain date carries cultural significance (1970-01-01), it would have more hits/results, than a date that carries zero, to little, significance (2641-10-02). If 8 is your lucky number, chances are (Chinese) people local to you, also have picked this as their lucky number.<p>Then the key to picking a less predictable sequence is to pick a sequence that doesn&#x27;t appear (a lot) in the search engine index. With a little luck we don&#x27;t even have to get the hits for previous draws, as a large search engine index is likely to already contain these draws.<p>So if we want to optimize for not sharing with a large amount of people, and we assume that the lottery numbers are highly random: pick number ranges that do not compress well with the previous draws and pick number ranges that have a low result count in a search engine like Google.<p>[1] Tasked to pick a random number between 1 and 4, there is a bias to picking 3. When between 1 and 10, there is a bias to picking 7. Why this is? 3 and 7 may appear more special than 6 (2<i>3) or 4 (2</i>2). Also the phrasing of picking _between_ 1 and 4 might throw of humans to NOT pick 1 or 4. A randomrange program doesn&#x27;t care for such human subtleties.<p>Random passwords are harder to remember for humans (this might be because the &quot;mind program&quot; to generate them is complex and requires more energy). Human passwords often contain dictionary words and commonly used patterns (which are faster and cheaper to regenerate).",1376578388

Twenty years ago, university graduates from good schools seemed to have a choice of offers from high-prestige jobs (the one&#x27;s they were after) like banks, megacorps, airlines, etc. These days, you see some good graduates selecting from much farther down the prestige chain (e.g., small, local corp., cram school teacher, etc.) with fewer choices (if any).<p>- The overall quality of students seems to be lower in schools that have the same prestige. Even Todai and Kyodai students, while still impressive, don&#x27;t seem to be what they used to be socially, intellectually, or academically. This isn&#x27;t really directly related to the economy, but the universities are the feeders into the economy.<p>- The corporate folks seem to complain that the quality of applicant has dropped over the past two decades, and the quality has sometimes dropped (they say) to a point below a threshold of acceptability. As such, they do not hire, hire temps, or hold their nose and hire. Some of this is certainly hubris, but none of it bodes well for the workers, the corporations, or the economy.<p>- The number of small businesses seems to have dropped precipitously. The most obvious is bars/snacks and restaurants (e.g., once popular nightspots now seem dead even on their busiest nights), but the number of small support businesses (e.g., small light industrial shops, distributors, etc.) seem to have decreased as well. Some of this is due to legal changes that took away legally-mandated middlemen, but other parts of it seem to be due to lack of demand.<p>- Everyone is worried about money and jobs.<p>- The famous savers of Japan seem to be mostly the folks in their 50s and higher (maybe 40s), but the folks in their 30s and younger seem to be mooching A LOT off of these savings and not really saving as much on their own.<p>- There is a massive generational gap between people who came of age before the bubble crashed and those who came of age after. The older folks seem to think that the younger people are lazy and just need to be more disciplined, and the younger people think the older generation just don&#x27;t get the new economic reality. This tension is ripping the social fabric of Japan and seems to create a lot of inefficiencies.<p>- The velocity of money seems a lot lower. If folks are interested, I can give some examples in a follow-up post.",1376578061

But so does English. It&#x27;s good to have a natural language that a large percentage of the world&#x27;s population, across nationalities and ethnic groups, can speak. I think the same applies in programming. Programming languages are not just for telling a computer what to do; they&#x27;re also for collaborating with other programmers. And once a code base is written in a particular language, it&#x27;s often hard to make a case for rewriting it in a different language. So why not use a language that is popular, is cross-platform, is vendor-neutral, has multiple optimized implementations, and is likely to remain popular and well-supported for many years to come? JavaScript is that language.<p>FWIW, I have much more experience with Python and Lua than with JavaScript. I also do some work in C++. Yet, despite JavaScript&#x27;s flaws, I&#x27;m defending it as a general-purpose programming language.",1376577607

All you need there is enough influence to ensure that the DEA targets the other guys, not your bread and butter. That also helps to support the price of drugs, increasing your margins.<p>Actually it could be even simpler than that. If you have enough spies in the DEA you could be one ahead of them, have intel about how they conduct searches, etc. Then the DEA would act for you like a passive turf enforcement army. With your advantage you could fly under the radar, allowing the DEA to mop up your competition and prop up your margins by creating scarcity. Spying on an organization is orders of magnitude easier than influencing it, and requires the compromise of lower-level personnel. There&#x27;s far more field agents and mid-level paper pushers than there are higher-up agenda setters and they make less money, making them easier targets to flip.<p>This is why the drug war is so bad for democracy and why prohibition encourages corruption. Put simply it creates a massive financial incentive for every kind of political corruption imaginable, and in so doing begets a &quot;corruption infrastructure&quot; that can be used for other kinds of crimes.",1376577511

I understand it enough to maintain the code I need to at work, but I&#x27;m not a &quot;JS Guy&quot;.<p>At the heart of my programming heraldry is C. From there I branched out into C++, Java, Perl, C#, etc.<p>In effect you are comparing JavaScript to Assembler, since CoffeeScript compiles to JS. I&#x27;m certain most people would agree that this is a ridiculous comparison, because as quirky as JavaScript can be it is far easier to work with than assembler. I wish people would stop making that comparison (I&#x27;ve been guilty of it myself, but I&#x27;ve stopped as of late).<p>In my view, the popularity of JavaScript comes down to two things: Interactivity and instant gratification.<p>I first played with JavaScript while in college in 1995. It blew my mind that I could just put some code into a text file and load it into Netscape and see stuff happen. No compiling, no linking, just text making the browser do things, and unlike Java it did not require me to upload an applet and hope that my target user had a JRE installed.<p>Today you have things like Chrome dev tools and JS Fiddle where you can get even more of that.<p>The velocity of going from idea to web app (site) is a lot nicer for most people.<p>IMHO JavaScript is the programming equivalent of an LLC. It&#x27;s quick to start, low capital investment, and doesn&#x27;t expose you to a lot of risk.<p>Anyhow...that&#x27;s my two cents that I had to throw in before more veins in my head popped.",1376577215

Writing each() was <i>the main</i> challenge and goal in my development process; the most enjoyable part of it. Look at the code itself and how much of core.js is devoted to giving each() it&#x27;s power and flexibility. each() also powers the alter.js (as it should all extensions).   Calling it a cop out is flat out ignorant. What you also don&#x27;t know is that i&#x27;ve writing javascript since it&#x27;s beginning. I am no stranger to the DOM nor its history. I&#x27;ve been building apps with web technology full time for 12 years. Your &quot;you don&#x27;t know what your doing&quot; posturing is again, founded in ignorance of me and my code. There is no choice in this library that i made in ignorance of the tradeoffs nor of the conventions i am challenging. Accept that, please.<p>And i am most certainly NOT making things hard on myself. I forked Voyeur and rewrote it because the concept was so close to what i needed to make things much easier for working with the DOM. I needed a tight library that let me avoid branching code (unwieldy if/else) into either querySelector (node returned) and querySelectorAll (list returned). I wanted something that made it easy to traverse the short and usually quite static structures of my shadow DOMs or web components.  The gains are numerous for me (and many others). It baffles me that you think using HTML.js is harder than straight DOM.<p>Now my lecture... You need to stop seeing the DOM as a large, dynamic structure of myriad, loosely defined nodes. The future of the web (what i&#x27;m aiming for) is components: groups of encapsulated structures whose internal relationships are well-defined and whose external relationships are nearly irrelevant. You probably won&#x27;t understand the value of working close to the DOM with tiny libraries that don&#x27;t abstract everything away for you until you pull your head out of 2010 design patterns and into 2015 ones.",1376577013

This was of course after I had already told him to do it, and he ignored my advice.<p>I also told him his weight loss was likely a large degree of lean mass when he was only taking 50g/day of protein because that&#x27;s what the RDA was. He essentially ignored me, continued to shed lean mass while exercising and not getting enough calories. But a little while later he added more protein in.<p>The lack of boron was also something I told him about, and then he added it (fairly quickly, actually).<p>I also mentioned lack of semi-essential/conditionally essential nutrients (GLA).

Not being a graphic designer, I created a style for my personal blog that uses a large font for titles.  I think the design looks best when the title is short and only a single line.  So I recently titled a blog entry &quot;Unfair comparisons&quot; and when I submitted it to HN, I added parenthetical clarification to the title that this was about comparing across disparate attributes when benchmarking web development frameworks.  That clarification was later edited out of the HN submission, leaving just &quot;Unfair comparisons.&quot;<p>Fine.  It&#x27;s just my blog, so be it.  Like I said, it&#x27;s my own fault for making a design that limits my title length, and I should correct that if I had a serious problem with the policy.  But since I was asked at submission time to provide a title, I preferred giving the potential reader here at HN some added clarity about the subject matter before they clicked.

It may be an automatic mechanism informed by previous heavy flagging of other articles from the same domain or any number of other heuristics, but it happens too quickly for it to be the result of user action on the specific article.<p>As far as I can tell, flagging affects the sorting algorithm for the home page (use of the user script &quot;HN Slapdown&quot; allows you to visualize each article&#x27;s score versus its rank order, providing color coding to indicate heavily-flagged articles) but I have not in my admittedly short HN experience ever seen an article become dead as a direct result of flagging.<p>I have my own misgivings about the rigid title-normalization policy so I appreciate him and the op taking the time to ask some questions.",1376575902

If order is only important within gender, then you can happily just add the men onto the end of the original manList.  If it is important across all people, then you have to have a &quot;personList&quot;.<p>Just like you might have a &quot;personList&quot; that can contain &quot;male people&quot; and &quot;female people&quot;, you can automatically map the whole sequence of &quot;a elements&quot; and &quot;b elements&quot; to an &quot;elementList&quot;.<p>In the case of mixed content (text nodes and element nodes together), you would simply map them all to a &quot;nodeList&quot;.",1376575245

With JS on hardware, we might have a new way to design HCI other than those pretty wireframes in Photoshop.<p>IMHO, JS is a laguage designed for APIs, which is good for exploring ideas and protyping. There is always a way to push the performance to another layer, like CSS boosted by GPU.",1376575213

A lot of mice these days are so heavy I don't know how people can use them for 8-10hrs at a time. Also, it has just enough buttons to be useful without having so many it's annoying (you don't accidentally hit them).",1213865922

He had a mission to complete, and he had the passwords to help him complete it, so he took the simple path. Sounds like a hacker to me.<p>That said, the punishment does not fit the crime.",1213865916

221647,comment,220864,221368,0,0,pmjordan,,,"There are quite a few, at least in the casual and PC game sector. You stand almost no chance on consoles, as the console manufacturers won't give you the SDKs and won't let you sell your game for their console unless you go through an established publisher. The publishers generally require you to sign over all ""IP"" (concept, names, characters, art, code) to them, which doesn't make it attractive to your average startup founders.<p>The only publisher I know of that doesn't do this is GameCock, (<a href=""http://www.gamecockmedia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamecockmedia.com/</a>) they're effectively a startup as well, although the founders are industry veterans.",1213863188

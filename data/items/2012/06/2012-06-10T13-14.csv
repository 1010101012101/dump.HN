Most Ruby & Python devs I've met would admit that Java is a much better choice than their perspective languages for something like that requires distributed concurrency and speed (like Cassandra or Redis). The people I'm talking about are the ones that wouldn't look seriously at RabbitMQ because it's written in Erlang, not Java.",1339336796

4091051,comment,4090831,4090831,0,0,cheald,,,"JSON's appeal is that it is both compact and human readable/editable. If you're willing to sacrifice all semblance of readability/editability, then sure, let's all do the binary marshaling format dance like it's 1983.<p>Additionally, if you're sending data to a browser, then you're cutting the knees out of native JSON.parse implementations (Internet Explorer 8+, Firefox 3.1+, Safari 4+, Chrome 3+, and Opera 10.5+). The copy claims ""half the parsing time"" (just because of smaller data size), but I'm <i>exceptionally</i> skeptical of those claims since this is just going to move the parser back into Javascript.<p>I whipped up a quick example to demonstrate my point: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2905882"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/2905882</a><p>My results (using Chrome's console):<p><pre><code>    JSON size: 386kb
    MsgPack size: 332kb
    Difference: -14%

    Encoding with JSON.stringify 4 ms
    Encoding with msgpack.pack 73 ms
    Difference: 18.25x slower

    Decoding with JSON.parse 4 ms
    Decoding with msgpack.unpack 13 ms 
    Difference: 3.25x slower
</code></pre>
So MsgPack wins the pre-gzip size comparison by 14%, but then is nearly <i>twenty times slower</i> at encoding the data, and is over three times slower at decoding it.<p>Furthermore, once you add in gzip:<p><pre><code>    out.json.gz: 4291 bytes
    out.mpak.gz: 4073 bytes
</code></pre>
So, our grand savings is 218 bytes in exchange for 78ms slower parsing time. It'd still be faster to use JSON's native encoding/decoding facilities even if your client were on a 28.8k baud modem.",1339336685

My main experience has been on the Microsoft stack, but I have learned and worked with a lot of tech, including Rails and Django. Last year I worked on a project for which we chose Java EE 6.<p>There's a lot of good stuff there; for instance simple, bloat-free architecture, JPA (the new persistence architecture), CDI (context and dependency injection), JAX-RS (REST), JSF +  PrimeFaces (very productive front-end development) and lightweight, fast web application servers (Tomcat 7, Glassfish).<p>And you have access, when and if you need it, to a very mature, stable and capable set of libraries, open source projects and tools.

BTW I was quoting OP, where he mentioned he uses Java for basic web development.<p>> I mean if you are a front-end developer/designer and mess with CSS/JS/HTML all day (without format CS education), you are probably wondering why concurrency even exists, but in real-world programming you can't go far without it.<p>I said evented servers out-perform threaded servers. Threaded servers will eat more RAM and have higher cost of context switching. As far as application code goes, your controller isn't supposed to spawn threads(at least mine doesn't). The heavy-lifting should be done by the background services, and you can very well do concurrency in Ruby/Python(EventMachine, gevent). Generally, threaded code doesn't cut it where number of threads are large.<p>And I am pointing this out for the second time. You ignored it all and went on a tangential regarding how I am a frontend developer/designer without formal cs education, and am wondering why concurrency even exists.<p>> but in real-world programming you can't go far without it.<p>Yay.

In practice, ""gypsy cabs"" often serve neighborhoods where the regulated cabs don't bother to go.<p>Regarding ""rob riders"", direct robbery is still illegal - you don't need industry-based regulation to accomplish that end. But if by ""rob"" you really mean ""cheat"", the market has evolved multiple mechanisms to make fares transparent. One of these is the ""zone card"", where the price of the trip depends on how many zones away your destination is from your source. Where jitney traffic is legal, the zone map and price list could even be printed in a sticker on the door so you can see the expected fare before you get in.<p>Regarding ""clog the roads"", a functioning jitney system makes it much less necessary for people to own personal cars. (and as a non-car-owning manhattanite, I'd love for the roads to be ""clogged"" with cabs if that meant I could reliably <i>find</i> one to go to Brooklyn or Queens).

Think Opentable for minority hair care services.<p>As an AA, it is hard to locate a barber that focuses on certain hair types and once you do find one, the headaches continue. You often have to wait multiple hours for a hair cut to realize you forgot cash and have to run to an ATM. So inefficient on both sides.<p>In a nutshell, I am in the process of building a web/mobile app that brings together barbers and their clients in an open platform that is a WIN-WIN for both sides.<p>On the barber side, the app allows:
1. schedule and client management
2. mobile payment (e.g., square card service)
3. promote services through instant pic uploads to myBarber website.<p>On the customer side:
1. Find and locate barbers, especially those often hard to find such as freelance, minority-serving, etc. 
2. Book and pay via cc/debit card
3. Ability to rate and see what barbers/beauticians  your friends use (social media connect).<p>Specifically, I would like to get your feedback on:<p>1. What do you think of the idea?
2. Is focusing on a niche market limiting myself? (i.e., barbers, AA community, beauticians)

There are effects that push in the other direction too. For instance, the fact that ""stabilization"" exists at all makes being a landlord less attractive. If people could bargain freely to any mutually-agreeable rent terms, developing new housing would be less risky so more apartments would tend to get developed, which would drive down the average rent. Stabilization can hold down prices in a few apartments, but tends to do so at the expense of higher prices (and lower-quality apartments) everywhere else.",1339335095

I don't have a huge problem with the latter; it's a much better system. If RS were made uniform across the city, I wouldn't consider that such a bad thing.<p>Only about 2% of apartments are rent controlled, but when the vacancy rate in Manhattan is regularly below 1%, that makes a huge difference.<p>There's a fallacious argument people make that, if only 2% of people have RC apartments, they're only responsible for a +2% markup on New York rents. That implicitly assumes the demand elasticity for housing is exactly 1. Not so. This is a bad assumption. Consider the oil crisis of 1973, which established that a 5% drop in oil supply can cause prices to go up 5x or worse. The same happens with housing in urban areas: small discrepancies in availability can have huge effects on price.<p>Rent stabilization is a lot better and fairer because normal people actually have a chance of getting it, and because it's a more reasonable system. It would be even better if whatever schema were applied to New York were applied uniformly, but RS is a much better and fairer system than RC.<p>I maintain the position that RC does an extreme amount of damage. If the demand-elasticity for New York housing were 1, it wouldn't, but it's much higher.<p>Also, I have no problem calling rich people who exploit a system that was designed to help working-class people, at the expense of everyone else who has to pay these insanely high rents, ""cockroaches"", especially given that they usually break the law in doing so. My problem isn't with legitimate RC beneficiaries who couldn't afford to live in New York otherwise, and who probably comprise a small fraction of 2012 RC-holders, but with well-connected marketing directors making $200,000 per year and alimony socialites who pay $350/month for prime apartments while the rest of the city gets shafted.<p>(For the record, New York landlords, as a class, would probably <i>lose</i> if RC were abolished, because it's quite likely that the free-market demand elasticity of housing is much greater than 1. Individual landlords who had RC tenants would gain, but landlords with no RC tenants would be getting less rental income, and the overall effect on landlords as a class would be reduced income because the artificially high rents paid by non-RC tenants would plummet.)",1339334353

We were doing this for fun, and aren't experts in the domain, but I think our score was within 'diminishing returns' of the better teams.<p>There are a couple of things to realize about this challenge:<p>I wouldn't conceptualise the challenge as trying to find features of good essays. It is more about trying to find features that are predictive of the essay being good.<p>This is a subtle but important distinction.  One example is that the <i>length</i> of essay was hugely predictive of the score the essay would get - longer meant better.<p>Is a longer essay really a better one?  No.  But, at the level the students were at, it just so happened that the students who were able to write better, also were able to write longer essays.<p>While you get good accuracy using techniques like this, its debatable how useful or robust this general approach is - because you aren't really measuring the <i>quality</i> of the essay, so much as you are trying to find features that just happen to be predictive of the quality.
Certainly, it would seem fairly easy for future students to game, if such a system was deployed.<p>This isn't a general attack on machine learning competitions - but I wonder, if for situations that are in some sense adversarial like this (in that future students would have an incentive to game the system), whether some sort of iterated challenge would be better?  After a couple of rounds of grading and attempting to game the grading, we'd probably have a more accurate assessment of how a system would work in practice.<p>There is another important feature of this essay grading challenge, that should be taken into consideration.  There were 8 sets of essays, each on a different topic.  So, for example, essay set 4 might have had the topic 'Write an essay on what you feel about technology in schools'.  To improve accuracy, competitors could (and I would guess most of the better teams did) build separate models for each individual essay-set/topic.  This then increased the accuracy of, say, a bag of words approach - if an essay-set 1 essay mentioned the word 'Internet' then maybe that was predictive of a good essay-set-1 essay, even though the inclusion of 'Internet' would not be predictive of essay quality, across all student essays.<p>Its important to remember this when thinking about the success of the algorithms. The essay grading algorithms were not necessarily general purpose, and could be fitted to each individual essay topic.<p>Which is fine, as long as we realize it. The fact that it was so easy to surpass inter annotator agreement (how predictive one of the human graders scoring was of the other human graders scoring) was interesting. Its just important to realize the limits of the machine learning contest setup.<p>I would guess that accuracy would down on essays of older, more advanced students, or in an adversarial situation where there was an incentive to game the system.",1339333888

Standardizing cab appearance and fares so customers aren't confused, standardizing cab behavior in various ways, that sort of thing.<p>The downside of this system is that - like nearly every other regulatory system - it is subject to ""regulatory capture"".

A good web app is generally easier and cheaper to build and better than a bad GUI app.<p>I think the server is where Java shines. Good Java is almost as fast as good C (if it's not, you're using bloaty libraries or being cavalier with memory), and when something breaks you get a stack trace that a support team can make some sense of, and the build/dependency system is a lot nicer.<p>Sun sold Java as a plug-together ecosystems. They encouraged a mindset of putting together big teams of developers who live in padded IDEs and lean on bloaty frameworks, and not to think about resource usage. This won a mental traction with companies who wanted to believe that software work and developers should be a commodity, but has lead to a lot of bad systems. The results cause people to have some strange ideas about Java, like that it's slow.<p>The Java world places a lot of emphasis on inheritance, which may be an anti-feature. Before I became fluent with python I used to create thick abstract class hierarchies that aimed for perfection and reuse. In truth the result was a bloaty, brittle mess. Python's awful inheritance model forced me to learn how to think in ways other than inheritance.<p>Your example technology stack isn't a like-for-like criticism. You're criticising Java because Oracle takes up stack of memory and because you'd choose to use hybernate and spring. Why can't you use lighttpd, fastcgi, Java and mysql? The rails ORM isn't sophisticated, and it'd only be a couple of days' work to hack something up equivalent in Java. The result will be faster than rails and less memory intensive.<p>You missed the obvious advantage of rails over java for web development - a lot of web development involves heavy string processing, and the tools you get in ruby/python style languages for list processing and string manipulation are a luxury compared to what you get in Java!  That was the main reason I moved away from Java for web work. With Java you try to build things to be configurable. You might need to do a different option later, and you know that it will be a laborious refactor. Whereas with scripting languages, the configuration language and the programming language are the same thing. So you just write the thing to do what you need it to do. And if you needs change a bit later, you throw away what you had without it feeling like the death of a child and then do the new thing and get on with your life.",1339333523

As far as servers go, evented servers(thin, mongrel) will perform as good as, if not better, than a threaded server. And evented servers can handle much more concurrent requests than threaded servers.''<p>I don't know what is 'basic web development', but the argument 'why do we need concurrency if I rarely use it' doesn't work. I mean if you are a front-end developer/designer and mess with CSS/JS/HTML all day (without format CS education), you are probably wondering why concurrency even exists, but in real-world programming you can't go far without it.",1339333329

This is the most touching and pure recorded material of things I've ever created. And they start at 300MB up to 2-3 GB sometimes. It might be a great song at a concert, it might be an interview I did or a whole lot of other things contained in 1-10 minutes of video. And while everyone surely sees this happening in the future, transferring these massive amounts of data to an online (my photos alone exceed over 300GB) is really hard to imagine, especially with the fear of losing it all through a crash. Which, I also have at home, in terms of risk. And selecting/picking certain photos to upload is going to ruin my master-scheme of things, it'll lead to new disaster for me.<p>So, if there will/is a way to upload EVERYTHING, which my bandwidth probably supports in a 1-2 months time-frame, and all my data is super-secure for LIFE (my life-time at least), then well, then I'd be happy to hand over all my most emotional material.<p>I'll check out the service when I get to it, it might be a great way to collect all my mobile snapshots from various sources and use it as a collector of being on the move.",1341697710

The easiest thing to do is to create time boundaries<p>Corporate culture (including some startups I know) value face time over outcomes (input vs. output valuation). If something goes wrong, managers tend to point to face time rather than the host of other factors, so people work even when there is no need. Face time = working hard. It is a vicious cycle and creates a huge inefficiency.<p>The solution is to create firm... let me repeat FIRM boundaries on things you value, whether family time or time at the gym. While this creates a constraint and seems bold, it improves efficiency because most of the time we spend in the office does not create value. It is pointless meetings, calls that go to long, and mindless Facebook scrolling. If your employees or your manager knows that you will leave at X time, it is remarkable to see how efficient your colleagues become.<p>Here is GOOD's post on sleep for entrepreneurs

Its valuable primarily in terms of performance, and is a terrible idea in terms of correctness and security.<p>In runtime-managed languages, efficient access to memory buffers is achieved by exposing an array type, and then performing basic bounds checking on array access. This is efficient enough for most purposes, is essentially what you achieve by using NSData, and is generally implemented in a way that is vastly <i>more</i> efficient than NSData.<p>Direct memory access in straight C will be faster, but it's also enormously error prone, and something I avoid if at all possible when writing ObjC or even straight C.<p>While there's no discounting the performance value of being able to operate at this level (or write straight assembly), it's rarely a useful thing to do when writing most application-level code, especially when weighed against the propensity for failure.<p>All managed languages allow for extension through C for the cases where low-level performance is required.

In addition, the FAA and others in private industry aren't going to spend money on developing systems for vehicles that don't exist.<p>This is not a bad thing. This freedom has resulted in a variety of designs for personal aircraft/road vehicles, e.g. Moller's harrier-like flexible fuel VTOL solution, Terrafugia's folding wing pusher/rear-prop airplane, PAL-V's gyrocopter with collapsing pusher/rear-prop and 3-wheeled motorcycle. It's a lot like the early designs in the beginning of the 20th century.<p>I have a feeling that energy and propulsion science advances within 40 years due to increased computing speed/power and better AI will result in a radically different design for all flying vehicles, though. But that doesn't mean that we can't learn from the designs people are creating now, even if you have to have a pilot's license to operate one of these vehicles.",1341696915

The fact they are trying to sell it as a service shows they are behind the curve.  Using buzz phrases like ""time to value"" and ""time to insight"".<p>How about the time it takes to get programmers to stop using iterative, loop bases programming and braindead IDE's?<p>The author of the Pregel article talks about graphs and vertexes.

I'd provide a more complete rebuttal, but lacking any specific examples, I can only definitively state that GC significantly reduces the likelihood of having to debug memory related issues, especially tracking down leaks due to reference cycles.<p>In comparison to GC, the main advantage of reference counting systems is that they are <i>deterministic</i>.<p>However, they do a lot of book-keeping that is expensive in aggregate and may not even be necessary in a garbage collected system. There are GC designs that mix GC and reference counting to achieve the best of both -- another poster in this thread provided a link to some papers on the subject.<p>The major downside to reference counting -- other than the expensive-in-aggregate book keeping mentioned above -- is, as mentioned above, that they can't handle reference cycles.<p>On iOS it's terrible easy to create cycles, and prior to the introduction of __weak, it was almost impossible to build thread-safe code that also involved a cyclic reference, due to it being impossible to invalid another thread's reference to your object (short of hacking out your own zeroing weak reference implementation, which is what people were forced to do).<p>This ease of creating cycles, especially with blocks and GCD, leads to a proliferation of careful and manual application of __weak designators on self-references. Instead of simply using an instance variable from a block, you must be certain to only access it through a __weak-marked references.<p>Additionally, you now have to worry about NULL-dereferencing! Example:<p><pre><code>  __weak MyObject *weakself = self;
  _block = ^{
      // Whoops! weakself could be nil here. Should have used a property,
      // which would have just passed a nil argument to runWithTX. Whoops!
      [opManager runWithTX: weakself->_txid];

      // Also, weakself could be deallocated *after* the above call succeeds,
      // so what we really needed to do as a first step in the block was
      // capture a -strong- reference to weakself, and return immediately
      // if we'd been deallocated
      MyObject *strongSelf = self;
      if (self == nil)
          return;

      // Whoops, accidentally referenced self via _txid below,
      // causing a retain cycle
      NSLog(@""Running with _txid=%@"", _txid);
  });
</code></pre>
This is awful. If the language used a hybrid ARC refcounting with cycle breaking, that code would simply read:<p><pre><code>  _block = ^{
      [opManager runWithTX: _txid];
      NSLog(@""Running with _txid=%@"", _txid);
  });</code></pre>",1341696649

First is the interpeter, which is used to execute bytecode prior to it being compiled. The second is the compiler, which implements  runtime optimized compilation of hotspots into native machine code, including the ability to make assumptions regarding types and then <i>uncompile</i> hotspots if those assumptions prove false.<p>Before you say ""ah ha, an interpeter!"", it's also notable that the JVM's interpreter is <i>not</i> an interpeter in the traditional sense (ala Ruby). Rather, the JVM's interpreter is an architecture-specific interpreter that decodes JVM bytecode and spits out unoptimized direct machine code based on a standard set of machine code templates. This is fast, but there's not optimized compiler, and so it's not nearly as fast as the result of the optimizing compiler that is run over the hotspots.<p>All that said, JIT vs AOT is a technical decision with mixed advantages. In theory, there are optimizations that can only be performed via JIT, based on runtime analysis. The simplicity of AOT can often provide runtime performance gains simply by avoiding the runtime costs of evaluation and compilation. JIT of bytecode allows for binary/library portability across different machines without worrying about rebuilding or shipping multiple binaries. AOT is somewhat more difficult to decompile compared to unoptimized byte code.<p>Mono compiles down AOT for iOS, in theory you could do the same with Java.

Child contexts? In theory, they're awesome. But we've ran into a number of nasty cases where objects were getting over-released on cleanup of the context.

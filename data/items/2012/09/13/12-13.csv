If you've ever tried to do anything more than a simple job on a car without a good set of tools and a car lift, then you'll be completely aware of how horrible it can be.<p>For small jobs (change the brake pads, change the oil), this might make sense (but they're not the kind of job you tend to get ripped off on). For large jobs (change the clutch without good access?) it would simply be horrible for the mechanic.<p>There's a reason everyone who works on their own cars desires a pit or car lift.",1347541099

One of the major bonuses of this for me as an interviewer is to see how the candidate solves the problem over time (as opposed to just seeing the finished product).<p>However, as a candidate, the coding process is pretty painful. I tried it out for C# and there is no intellisense, no compilation, no type checking, etc. This means that I'm more likely to just write it in VS, then cut and paste the solution into the webform, which reduces the value for me as an interviewer because I can't see the process. Even for languages like Python and Ruby, I would see most devs using the editor they are used to and cut and pasting since it would be faster / easier. This makes it hard for me as an interviewer to distinguish between someone that's just good and someone that cut and pasted a solution off the web.<p>Not sure the best way to fix it. A plugin to popular IDEs for the languages that use them. Improved coding experience on the webpage itself. Some plugins for something like vim, emacs, textmate, sublime or something that can be used for most languages. All those options are tough. Good luck :)<p>Also a small note.

I've spent significant portions over the last 3 years ill from problems that are probably stress related. I've gained weight, lost fitness and my work-life balance has gotten terribly out of whack. I just realized earlier in the week that my license expires next week and I literally have so many meetings scheduled that I simply won't be able to make it to the DMV in time. I've even had to cancel my vacation for the later part of this year.<p>I realized this year that of the three major parts of my day, with 1/3 sleeping and 1/3 working, I'm so miserable that the 1/3 I should have as free time is simply wasted either over working, or coping with stress. And realistically I'm not even getting my 1/3 sleeping time either.</i><p>That was my situation up until 5 months ago, and the pay cut I took to get out of it (about 10%) was worth every penny.  People have told me since then that I now seem like a completely different person.<p>In my situation, the mental load got so bad that it actually started hampering my ability to find another position[1].  I started approaching every nibble with desperation and likely underperformed on multiple interviews due to the self-imposed pressure to get them right so I could get out of my miserable situation.  I worried about actually having time for interviews with the schedule I was working.  My failure to find something else then fed back and made the problems related to the job worse by injecting hopelessness.  I finally managed to break that cycle long enough to find a position at a very small local company.<p>[1] As a bit of background to put this and the following statements in context, I live in Dallas and spent almost 10 years at a major defense contractor here.  I also have some issues with explaining my experience in detail, particularly confusion over my ""systems engineer"" title[2] and not being able to talk about the good stuff I did.<p>[2] Aerospace/defense systems engineers are not what most of you probably think of when you hear that title: <a href=""http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx</a>",1347539717

This is a ludicrous prospect for a lone developer.""<p>Perhaps that's true for a hobbyist. But any professional software developer should already be familiar with at least one (if not all) of those languages, and should be able to pick up the others with very little work.<p>Once you know C#, for instance, you'll quickly see that Java is essentially a subset of it these days. Sure, there are differences, but they're quite minor. The same goes for Objective-C, to some extent. The syntax is a bit different, but most of the concepts are similar enough. Even the most commonly-used libraries for each don't actually differ that much in practice.<p>In fact, many developers with experience in industry will have already had to use multiple languages at the same time throughout their careers. They'll already know how to work on several projects simultaneously, using several languages, and many more libraries.<p>In fact, I'd suspect that most of these professionals would feel very handicapped if they were forced to use JavaScript for all development. JavaScript has proven time and time again to not be a good language for anything but short scripts. Languages like C++, Java, C#, and Objective-C have core features that make large-scale, distributed software development possible. JavaScript lacks these, and anyone working on a large JavaScript code base will know the pains that arise.<p>It won't be good for Firefox OS if only the most inept developers are attracted to it.

A 50-USD cell phone is low-end because there aren't many models that cost less than that (modulo subsidies etc) just like a U$15k new car is low-end, notwithstanding the fact that relatively few people can afford one in Brazil.<p>Besides, the bulk of households in Brazil earn more than the minimum wage. C class in the graph below corresponds to people in households earning around 2~4x minimum wage. While in developed countries these people would be definitely considered ""poor"", in Brazil they're basically ""lower-middle class"". And yes, many of them can afford low-end cell phones.<p><a href=""http://www.asiacomentada.com.br/2011/03/melhoria-da-distribuio-de-renda-no-brasil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asiacomentada.com.br/2011/03/melhoria-da-distribu...</a>",1347538575

They showed us a prototype (ZTE phone) running one of the lastest builds of Firefox OS (not the nightly, though). We touched it and it had pretty good perfomance. It was somewhat snappy on scrolling items, but overall a similar performance that you get on a medium-cost Android phone.<p>Then we asked about that device. It was a crappy ZTE with 600 MHz CPU and with the poorest Qualcomm chipset. This blew out my mind: a non-optimised system was running with acceptable performance on the lowest of smartphones. I can't imagine how will this perform when it's fully optimised on a high-end smartphone. They're doing a great work.",1347538488

That's their grave and it's up to them to dig themselves out of it or wallow in it.<p>The other big problem is one of expectations. Unfortunately, they have trained people into believing that transferring money back and forth is frictionless and painless. Which, at a small scale it generally is with paypal. However, once you get into the range of taking a significant amount of money via paypal (defined as around median US income or higher) then everything changes. When you start using paypal as a processor for your personal business then all sorts of financial regulations come into play and all sorts of business rules imposed by VISA and MC come into play as well.<p>And then people do stupid things like take pre-orders for something that won't be shipping for months (a VISA/MC/legal nono) or take donations without being registered as a non-profit org. and you mix in a good helping of problem #1 and a lot of people end up having more than a few bad days.<p>However, the thing that many people don't appreciate due to their ignorance is that with a merchant account a bank is going to do all of these same things for all of the same reasons. They are going to ""steal"" (read: put a hold on) your money while they spend the time working out whether or not your questionable business activity is not actually fraud, or money laundering, or simply sufficiently risky as to require a higher balance to be maintained in case of charge backs.<p>Now, the more business you put through paypal the more it makes sense for them to dedicate real-live human oversight to your account, which can lead to leniency if they see that you aren't a fraudster/mobster/etc.<p>Make no mistake though, every single day paypal has to deal with those folks too, only we don't hear about it because no fraudster, phisher, or mobster is going to complain on the internet about being shutdown legitimately by paypal.",1347537674

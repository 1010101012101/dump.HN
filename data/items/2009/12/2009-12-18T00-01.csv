1002299,comment,1002050,1002182,0,0,patio11,,,"I love Harry Potter, but somebody needs to explain to me how e.g. the Weasleys experience material privation by Muggle standards with regards to things like not being able to afford clothes when both Weasley parents and, for most of the series, most of their children are all capable of conjuring valuable things (including clothes) from the ether.  Or how Harry is rich like a king due to his inheritance despite his parents having no detectable business or reason for excessive wealth (well, aside from their prodigious abilities at conjuring valuable things from the ether).  Or how Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, both of which are shown as having truly <i>prodigious</i> amounts of wealth expended in their construction and upkeep, are sustained via contributions from a parallel economy where the level of economic sophistication has not exceeded ""a one-room store attended by an artisan"", except for (apparently) multinational corporations, branding campaigns, and market sophistication in... quidditch broomsticks.<p>Economics is a real spoilsport for fantasy literature.  I was once taught a single sentence which now nags at me in every book I read: ""Describe how this army is fed.""  For example, the carnivorous Canim in the Furies of Calderon series fielded an army of some 60,000 apex predators in a sparsely populated agricultural region for a period of over two years.  Their purchasing agent should require about as many sources of meat as all the McDonalds nationwide, but the economy as depicted couldn't possibly support that.",1261097433

1002276,comment,1001711,1002233,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>You don't learn math by listening to a teacher explain it. You learn math by working through problems. That requires homework.</i><p>You were fine until the last sentence.  Teachers can and do assign practice to be done within the classroom.  And practice time in the classroom has many advantages over homework.  The primary one being that students are much more likely to practice problems correctly, and get help if they are going in the wrong direction.  If the same student is assigned homework, the odds of correct practice strongly depend on the quality of adult assistance at home.<p>The important questions then become whether there is enough time spent in the classform for effective practice, and what the incremental benefit is or isn't from homework.<p>What does the research say?  It says that once you control for parent's education and socioeconomic status, there is little correlation between time spent doing homework and academic performance.  (Whether measured by future grades or standardized tests.)  <i>However</i> within the population assigned large amounts of homework, the correlation between academic success and parent's education and socioeconomic status increases.<p>This is evidence that 35 hours per week spent in a classroom is enough time for teaching and practice.  It is also evidence that homework on the whole doesn't help or hurt much, but does move responsibility for educational performance from the teacher to the parent.  As a well-educated parent this is modestly beneficial, because moving more responsibility for my children's education to me gives my kids an edge.  But at what cost?<p>The same research, unsurprisingly, finds very strong correlations between homework assigned and how much kids dislike school.  High homework levels also result in significant increases in family conflict.  The causes of both trends are so blindingly obvious as to not need discussion.<p>There is less research on homework versus academic performance in highschool.  But the absence of evidence of effectiveness of the treatment does not imply that the treatment level should be increased.<p>I don't know of any research on this in a university setting.  But there I support the use of homework for two reasons.  The first is that there is much less classroom time.  In school you spend over 35 hours/week in the classroom.  At university a full load might be 15 hours a week.  So practice needs to happen out of the classroom.  The second reason is that university is supposed to teach skills around independent study.  And the only way to practice <i>that</i> is to study stuff on your own.",1261096579

I had similarly difficult dealings with relatives, etc.   I have roughly 20 years on you so on the one hand, my advice might not apply because I'm so old and on the other hand my advice might be really important because I have 20 years more experience.  So take it as you will; this is the kind of thing I wish someone had said to me 20 years ago:<p>Forget other people's opinions, first.  Sorta.  Your close relatives are in one of two states, roughly speaking.  Either they are superstitious and just feel obligated to keep saying ""get a degree!"" or else they are sensitive to you and maybe know you better than you know yourself and are saying ""We can tell you'll regret not finishing, so finish.""  Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong - but whatever the case, it's not helping right now (per your report).  Gently but firmly set aside their pressure.  You are your own person right now and this is your first big ""test"", so to speak.  This is your painful process of emancipation.<p>Next, you have grand ideas about starting a company.  I'll assume that you are pretty darn smart and your ideas are very good.  I'll assume a company of the sort you imagine would win big.  That said:<p>Give up on it.  It's not going to happen.  Things are harder than you imagine and, anyway, even the best idea takes a lot of luck.  The odds with the bookmaker are that you are going to lose hard on that path.  Sure, keep a high self-opinion about your intellect but, basically, stop being so (self-defeatingly) arrogant, you ignorant twit.  (Sorry, I got carried away talking to my younger self there.  You are perhaps not an ignorant, arrogant twit of the sort I was but rather someone who just comes across that way. :-)<p>Your priorities, from my armchair, are food, shelter, health care, social life, and room to work on what moves you.   Are you good for paying rent indefinitely?  Not skipping any meals?  Getting your check-ups?  Going out and having fun?  Some time to spare to work on things like your start-up ideas?  Fantastic.  If not... get there.  Get a job.  Get a cheap but livable place to live.  Etc.  Stabilize your situation.  Stop relying on friend and family for money.   Get the fundamentals down.   Learn how to field grounders, to to speak (a baseball analogy).<p>Next, your 19 credits away?  What the hell is the matter with you?  OF COURSE you want the degree.   The past is the past and those are ""sunk costs"" but from where you are now, a degree is cheap.<p>So, by all means, quit being a full time student and get a job - any job that will fit, don't get cocky.  Wait tables if that will fit.   Do the paperwork/bureaucracy dance with your school and convert to being a part time student.  Complete your degree mostly ""at leisure"", within the next 2-4 years.   You'll feel good about it at the end and yes, it really is worth something ""on the market"" (for a job or for investment capital).<p>Most importantly: you will <i>lose</i> the opportunity for the sheepskin (degree) if you walk away from it at this stage.  If you take a 10 year break, those remaining credits will become much, much more expensive.   So don't do that.<p>Stabilize yourself as an independent economic actor.  Take <i>your</i> time, not external pressure, to drive your business ideas.   And finish your damn degree.",1261096384

I dropped out of the first college after 2-3 years (was hard and useless and tended to produce soulless zombies) and started another one which was much easier just to get my degree, while working at the same time. A few comments:<p>- college is about meeting people and doing different stuff.  It's been said a lot, but not enough.<p>- the very few (3 in my case) really good teachers made a difference. Falls into the ""meeting people, doing stuff"" thing.<p>- overall, I think wasting over 4 years on getting my degree was a mistake, probably the biggest one I made. When I didn't have to also go to college at the same time my freelancing really took of, and I probably did more in the next year then in the previous three. BUT - I have a career (not just a job) where it's very very unlikely anyone will ever ask me for a diploma.",1261095787

4275169,comment,4274505,4275136,4,0,jiggy2011,,,"Open source is a sustainable way of making software a zero money cost though. The contract is basically that they allow you to use the software on the basis that you <i>might</i> give some value back in the form of patches, bug reports or even just asking intelligent questions on their forum or paying for commercial support. Even if you don't they don't really lose anything.<p>A huge amount of OSS is fairly ""developer facing"" too, with possible exceptions of stuff like firefox of VLC (few people would imagine paying for a media player or browser today).<p>I agree though that bad FOSS evangelism may be partly to blame, if you tell everyone to ""use Linux because it is free, all software should be free!"" without explaining that price not the important part of the equation and you are a software developer yourself then I guess you can't be too surprised if people see that as endorsement to pirate Photoshop.",1342889877

We know that <i>E(number of drops for 2nd egg) = 1/2 the difference between two drops of the 1st egg</i>, and <i>E(number of drops of 1st egg) = 1/2 the number of intervals</i>, and <i>100 = the number of intervals  the difference</i>. So, we're minimizing <i>x + y</i>, knowing that <i>x  y = 100</i>.

The author should make it clear from the outset that the goal is to minimize the number of drops in the <i>worst</i> case, rather than to minimize the <i>average</i> case, especially since optimizing the average case is (in my experience) more common in optimization problems. He asks in parentheses what the worst case is, but that just sounds like a side question:<p>> The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution? (And what is the worst case for the number of drops it will take?)<p>Then in the solution he says:<p>> Problems where the solution lays lower down the building are taking less drops than when the solution lays higher up. <i>We need to come up with a strategy that makes things more uniform.</i><p>It is not explained <i>why</i> it has to be more uniform.<p>A more minor issue with this puzzle is that for the sake of thoroughness, the author should say is that the number of floors required to break the egg follows a uniform distribution (i.e., every floor is an equally likely candidate).",1342886652

Only afterwards did I realize that it is a simple Dynamic Programming problem.<p>Let f(y) be the number of drops required with y floors remaining.  At a drop from floor x, either the egg breaks and you must test all floors from 1 to x-1, or else the egg does not break and you have reduced to a smaller sub-problem with y-x floors.  So the number of drops required is 1 (for the current drop) plus the max of either x-1 or f(y-x).  We simply minimize this value over all potential floors x from 1 to y.<p>Here is a solution in C++:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/3156157"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3156157</a>",1342886499

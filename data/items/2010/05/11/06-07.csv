If you have few submissions, this effect is weak. As the number of submissions, users and votes all grow linearly with respect to each other, the number of top stories and the number of stories an average user can read stay the same. This means the stream of new stories gets less and less readable, while top stories stay readable, which makes larger and larger percentage of users just skim over the top stories, and quality suffers. It would be interesting to create an accurate mathematical model of this behavior, maybe this would let us significantly improve stability.",1273560770

Kentucky Blue Pole Beans, not 'Beans' and Organic Red Velvet Okra, not 'Okra'.<p>I wasn't sure I understood how large of a garden each seed pack is supposed to service.  When you say '3 10 foot beds' does that mean 30 linear feet, or 300 square feet?<p>I'd also make sure you get real-world feedback about the plans and the pricing.  If I was you, I'd go talk to people at local garden centers, and I'd bring my iPad and I'd ask them for help.  If you're young, claim you're a student and it's a school project.  If you're older, claim you're writing an article about this service and want to know what they honestly think.<p>I was surprised that the seeds weren't all organic / heritage (or that if they were, that wasn't marked.)  I could be wrong, but I'd expect the sort of person who goes through this trouble would likely prefer those varieties, and would be willing to pay accordingly.

But this puts EA in quite the quandary.<p>Rewarding gamers for purchasing the game new is rational and fair.  Not evil.  EA will make money and the gamer will continue to get well made games.  Just because a feature or part of the game was once 'free' doesn't justify it always being 'free'. The market is allowed to correct itself.",1273558486

They stated that data was replicated to more than one device to ensure that a single component failure would not result in data loss.<p>They didn't say it was bulletproof or impossible to loose data.  They explain fairly well how things work, what the failure rates are, and give you the tools to do the same risk analysis and cost/benefit calculations you would do anyway, whether using a cloud service or rolling your own.<p>Multiple equipment failure can happen.  Even across data centers and availability zones.  The larger the entire AWS system gets, the higher the chances of eventually seeing edge cases where the wrong equipment at just the wrong time screws up to lose data.<p>If you want bulletproof data storage system that has such a  rediculously low failure rate that you are guaranteed not to loose data for a hundred years, you can get it - but it's going to cost a heck of a lot more than anything Amazon is selling you.",1273558386

Why let the original purchaser play as much as they want, cap their usage too (~40-50 hrs of playtime for free) and charge them for usage beyond that. Also if the cost of running servers is so high and such a big drag,why dont they let third parties run game servers and charge a fee. That way competition among game server hosting companies would bring the price down closer to what it should be in the real world.",1273558110

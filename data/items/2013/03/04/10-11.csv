Anyone who's gotten anything done by asking someone to do it, or has found some information by asking a question of someone has engaged in the core activity of programming - i.e. the <i>thinking</i> behind what needs to be done and what information is needed for some task at hand and the communication of that thinking.<p>The <i>making</i> aspect of programming should also not be overlooked. Just as making your own table is fun even though you may not have made a good table by carpentry standards, or you may paint something to decorate your wall even if won't go for a penny on ebay, coaxing a machine to help you with something is also satisfying.",1362394774

Many of us did this with similar results in grad school or in our spare time as a hobby. You can even find some of them on SF or GH if you don't believe me.<p>This is one of those stories where something is dressed up to sound really good and a couple of years later you wonder to yourself, ""What ever happened to that?""

At 31 the world has changed a lot since the days when I played around with BASIC in the early 90s.<p>There so much to learn. The most helpful book so far has been Lesley Anne Robertson's, Simple Program Design. It's a basic algorithm book utilising pseudocode. My greatest and most recent victory has been completing the first two Project Euler challenges. The first challenge there is basically the famous FizzBUzz test.<p><i></i>* Warning <i></i>* If you hire me because I can FizzBuzz and conclude a fortiori that I can code then you're gonna have bad time :D<p>Hopefully it means that I do have the potential to code though..<p>It seems to me that a lot of the quick fixes out there aren't going to cut it on their own. Codecadamy is something I've used a little bit and it's a great learning tool for language specifics, but I don't feel like it taught be to think like a programmer. It doesn't break newcomers free from the old question, ""what's the best language for a beginner"". A slightly deeper understanding is required for that.<p>CarlH was very useful starting point: <a href=""http://www.computerscienceforeveryone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerscienceforeveryone.com/</a>",1362394230

This means (for instance) you get to watch your auth.log for failed login attempts and after 10 failures fire a script to ban him, alert sysop by email or have hubot alert your sysops. Or whatever floats your boat.<p>* File integrity monitoring. Make sure noone's been mucking around with your files. It has real-time support (through inotify), but if you don't want use that, make sure you store the database it keeps off-server for forensics if need be.

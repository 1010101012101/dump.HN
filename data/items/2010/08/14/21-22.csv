Most common would be Hindi, and one or two regional languages, and possibly English.  In the south it's more likely to be Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu or Kannada instead of Hindi, but there are others too.

Another is that if speed is a do-or-die feature, then they want to be able to control all of the factors which will make Google faster or slower. They can compete on tech, and so of course they want to compete on that footing.<p>Whether you think of them as evil or not, corporations rarely act out of <i>one</i> motivation. There are usually many many desires that get advanced or thwarted in the course of a particular act.<p>A company may buy a startup out of a desire for the tech or team, to work out the bugs its M&A pipeline on a relatively unimportant acquisition, to encourage <i>other</i> startups to focus on the acquirer's platform, to deny a competitor use of the tech or team, and to give a department within the parent a unsubtle hint that they are not doing their jobs.

I respect your decision but am uninterested in choosing a programming language based on a concurrency model.<p>That said, your (admittedly hypothetical) example is hideously broken. In EventMachine, and written properly:<p><pre><code>  def receive_data(buf)\n    @buf << buf\n    while have_complete_request?\n      begin\n        send_data(handle_next_request)\n      rescue => e\n        log(e)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nNotice the <i>single exception handler</i> bracketing the entire request.

Don't do that. Buffer, to create natural functional decomposition.<p>Evented code is rarely <i>as simple</i> as synchronous code, but there's no reason it has to be needlessly choppy.<p>That said, I think this design is overvalued. Yes, it's true, you (probably) can't always wrap an entire request's processing in a single exception handler in any evented Ruby library I know about. But I wouldn't wrap an entire request handler in a single exception handler in any case! If I was preparing to deal with a database exception, I'd wrap the code making the database call in an handler for the database exception. If I was preparing for a filesystem exception, &c &c &c.<p>Incidentally, I've been doing very, very, <i>very</i> large scale evented systems for going on about 10 years now (large scale: every connection traversing tier 1 ISP backbones), and, sorry, this stuff has never blown up on me.

I can access arbitrary memory in the CLR, but cannot on the JVM. I write as someone who has attempted to build a byte-code assembly file that would allow direct manipulation of binary arrays for the purpose of efficiently loading OpenGL vertex buffers that mix floats and ints. Cant be done in Java or in Dalvik (at least in 2.1). Easily done in CLR. Also, the handling of security and exceptions is different. I've also read all the JSRs with respect to this problem, related problems, generics, stack-based variables etc, and I'm also aware of the optimizations for stack-based elimination in 1.6 and 1.7.<p>Also, I admit I only read the first patent, but I believe it doesn't apply to Android simply because the Dalvik VM does not apply its security at the object level but the process level, thereby nuking the patent. As for mono, I doubt they would worry since they would simply point out that ""class"" and ""object"" have been used for determining security access since at least Windows NT. Or mono can simply turn off object level security and rely on the OS to do it. The whole list is replete with holes and workarounds.",1281822589

The writing part is fun, and being able to do it on my own terms (i.e., not kowtow to a publisher/editor's need to sell books by the pound rather than by content) was worth it to me.<p>The travel is even more so. I'd taken vacations before, but always came back wishing I had 1 or 2 more weeks more. With a day job, it was hell asking for 5 weeks or so. Now, I just go. And I no longer come back wishing I had another 2 week. The indignity of having to ask for permission always annoyed me, but I didn't realize how annoying it was until I didn't have to ask.<p>Ultimately, I think you have to ask what it is that drives you. Some people like being bosses and being able to lord it over their underlings. Those people will never retire, and they shouldn't. Their self-worth is dependent entirely on other people being subservient to them and their goals. But many INTJ types (especially engineers) don't have self-worth tied to the opinions of other people.

You can manually route exceptions around if you're careful, but that is definitely a pain in the ass and is sometimes very hard to test (hard to test exception handling for an exception you can't really fake for some reason). (Of course you can't always test it in threaded code either, but it's radically simpler there and therefore less likely to break, you don't have to test the plumbing.)<p>This is one of the reasons I've spent the last few years <i>fleeing</i> event-based code towards things like Erlang, rather than running towards it; I've been doing event-based code for non-trivial work and things well beyond ""demos"" and the plumbing just explodes in your face if you want to build actually-robust software where simply crashing in the middle of a request isn't acceptable. Despite my best application of good coding practices and refactoring you still can't get close to the simplicity of something like Erlang code.<p>(By the way, if you are stuck in evented land, one of the things I have learned the hard way is that anywhere your evented API has an error callback, you <i>absolutely must</i> provide one that does something sensible. I now always wrap such APIs in another layer of API that does nothing but crash as soon as possible if no error callback is provided. If you can't figure out what your error callback for a given such call should be, that's your design trying to tell you something's wrong.)",1281821917

Apropos nothing, I'm also unlikely to recognize ""dependency injection"" when I see it, as my first language was C, not Java.<p>Async code isn't ""likely"" to require callbacks; it will almost certainly involve callbacks, those being a central design feature of async code. You should play with the idea for a bit before forming an opinion about it.<p>I don't know what you mean by ""broken exception handling"". This may be a Rails-ism I'm unfamiliar with. I'm very familiar with Rails (we ship a fairly large product built on it), but I've never tried to shoehorn async I/O into it; like Twitter and presumably every other large site, we do Rails on the front-end/UI and fast things on the backend, in our case with EventMachine.<p>Like I said: I'm <i>not arguing</i> that Rails threading is bad, or even that Rails should have better async support. If I cared that much about the performance of my front end, I probably wouldn't be serving requests directly off Rails. Rails developers may very well be better off with threads. But that fact has little to do with the merits of threading and async <i>as concepts</i>.",1281821211

This is very much a deal between Google and Verizon over what position they could jointly support.

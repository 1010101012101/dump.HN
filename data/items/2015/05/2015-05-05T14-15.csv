9492800,comment,9491365,9492183,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Sadly, I suspect a phase of that sort is inevitable. For all the good it has done, the Internet inherently transcends national borders and therefore national cultures, laws, and tax systems. Western governments are, as a rule, all in favour of globalization when it means they can have cheap imports and new export markets, but much less keen on it when it means giving up control or tax revenues.<p>With physical international travel, and even physical shipping, there are inherent barriers to crossing borders or places where governments can impose checkpoints and reassert their authority at least within their own domain. With the Internet, as long as it remains open as it mostly is today, governments lack that control. Normal people deal with foreign contacts and businesses routinely every day. This is a threat to established powers like big businesses and governments, particularly in economic terms.<p>Given the most powerful efforts at international trade agreements we&#x27;re seeing today -- the likes of TPP and TTIP -- are not even being negotiated with real scrutiny by elected legislators any more, never mind the general public, I think we can safely assume that the upper echelons are now so corrupt that the present system is beyond hope. I would like to think that the freedom of communication and sharing of knowledge offered by the Internet would lead to a better system taking over, but as a realist I fear an increasing tendency to lock things down instead, at least for the short-to-medium term. Can&#x27;t have governments losing their sales taxes, major IP holders losing out to more liberal foreign IP regimes, and the like.<p>Obviously that lock-down will actually be catastrophic both culturally and economically, by hurting both the normal citizen and the small/young businesses trying to offer better ways to do things. I just don&#x27;t think the big business/big government complexes that dominate Western politics today care, as long as they keep their figures up for the next quarter/election.<p>That all said, I remain optimistic that in the long run the advantages of the Internet will win out. Sooner or later a generation who grew up never knowing a world without mobile communications and the Internet will come to power. Before then, corporate and government greed in the West may lead to another financial crisis and questions asked about our current systems of government and business practices last time may turn to direct action in more than just a few places like Greece.<p>I suspect we&#x27;re going to go through a pretty dark phase over the next few years as governments and business communities led by people who frankly don&#x27;t understand the technology anyway most of the time struggle to adapt to a changing world they can no longer manipulate as they used to. But I don&#x27;t think it will last forever, because the dinosaurs will become extinct in a decade or two and those who replace them will remember what they did.",1430837637

Finding what works for each of us as individuals is the most important thing. I agree with the potential therapeutic benefits of hallucinogens, but I also am a firm believer in the trial-backed science of medicine and therapy as the first and best line of defense. &quot;Ultra-safe sterile&quot; or not, it&#x27;s the best answer for the broadest range of people. Call me a Vulcan, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d suggest for people that are on &quot;the edge&quot;, instead of &quot;getting dirty&quot; or &quot;make mistakes&quot;, both of which might help, but also might let people slide further into the abyss. At least with medicine and their &quot;black-box&quot; labels, you are under the monitoring of a trained professional that can catch and negative side-effects of the medication.

Distortion also effectively compresses the signal. Sometimes it starts oscillating and generating notes that aren&#x27;t even being played.

I am burnt out on writing code.  I am burnt out on configuration.  I am burnt out on automating monotonous tasks.  I am burnt out on completing tickets.  I am burnt out on completing tickets that undo what those other tickets accomplished.  I am burnt out on debugging third-party advertising code.  I am burnt out on having 16 terminal tabs open.  I am burnt out on contributing to the “connected” culture.  I am burnt out on having a “40 hour” work week that actually occupies the majority of my mental time.  I am burnt out on sitting at a desk.  This state of being burnt out has invaded so much of my out-of-work life that I have decided to take my Life back.</i><p>So much of that is congruent with my experience as well. Yet, for reasons that seem hard to explain at first, I go deeper into the beast rather than move away from it (and my choice is in no way superior). I love what technology <i>can</i> do-- liberate humanity from drudgery, improve the human quality of life, make interactions and knowledge and discovery possible that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be-- and I enjoy the intellectual challenge. I hate so much of what it&#x27;s <i>actually</i> used to do: serve the short-term economic interests of power-holders who are incompetent but don&#x27;t want to give up their seats.<p>As much as I love being in the forest, I must be a natural urbanite because I have a natural draw toward being in the main fight. Even with the risk and clamor, I like carrying a sword (metaphorically speaking, since my chosen war is cultural and therefore fought by typing rather than swinging a blade). I feel like it is my destiny to be in the fight to take technology back from the current crop of useless power-holders. I <i>want</i> to be in this war, and I really fucking want to win it, but I can&#x27;t blame <i>anyone</i> for wanting to get the fuck out of it and work on a farm. It&#x27;s an appealing idea.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-farming (I mean, I like food) but I also recognize that, without technology, life would be a lot worse than it is right now. Not all of us can be farmers, not anymore. Munching Jira tickets to appease some middle manager may be a waste of life (nay, it is) but I still feel like <i>what we do</i> as technologists (or, at least, what we <i>can</i> do) is important. We&#x27;re a part of evolution and progress... even if many of us get drawn down into nonsense.<p>Reading the OP, I&#x27;m really glad that he found work that enjoys and that gives him a sense of purpose, and I hope that that never changes for him.

A 1.5 mile radius covers 4500.  A 1 mile radius, only 2000.  A 0.5 mile radius has 500 people in it.<p>Realistically, a person walking at 3 mi/h won&#x27;t walk more than 0.5 miles to visit the local shop, and a person bicycling at 12 mi/h won&#x27;t go more than 3.  They won&#x27;t, unless they are combining trips.  If the shop is on the way to somewhere else, or a very short distance beyond their primary destination, they might go further overall.<p>But pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure is practically nonexistent anywhere in the US except for a bare handful of cities and suburbs.  Many places don&#x27;t even have sidewalks.  Nearly everyone uses an automobile for personal transport.<p>As such, the &quot;local shop&quot; is right there at the gas station.  We call them &quot;convenience stores&quot;.  They are most often placed at the intersection of arterial roads.  So if you are lost in the back streets of suburbia, you will never see one.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense from a planning perspective, but it does from a money perspective.  When a developer subdivides a large property, they reserve commercial lots next to the arterial road, and build access roads past those into the residential lots.  In theory, once the houses are 80% built, all that residential traffic will be flowing past the commercial lots at least twice per day, and a business will build there.<p>In practice, the developer exits after 95% of the houses are built, dumps the remaining 5% and the commercial lots on a strawman company, moving on to the next subdivision, and those businesses never actually get constructed.<p>So you end up with huge areas of houses and very few businesses.  There might be one strip mall every 3 miles, filled with businesses that usually last a few months before failing from lack of customers.  (The exception is the pizza delivery, which will be absolutely thriving.)<p>Residential buildings simply have a higher profit margin.

Usually I do coding for Transit App, but I was given this analysis to do for sort of fun.<p>I was given a large database of (userId, timestamp, busNumber), and a scrape of the website with the schedules and and the task to figure out how often strangers would keep meeting each other on transit, as a sort of global missed encounters search.<p>It&#x27;s basically a big exercise of combining probability distributions. It’s impossible to infer what stop people get on because there are no vehicle ids; the only possible way to infer anything is to look at transfers (i.e. the time the user enters another bus, or the metro). The time is the time of the tap.<p>I figured out whether people do the same trip at around the same time of day on multiple days during the observation period, then record that as a ‘recurring trip’. I assume that a recurring trip is always done from and to the same approximate stops. From the schedules, I know how many buses are operating at any given time. For the rest it’s all probabilities<p>a) a probability distribution for how long people spend on different buses. This is calculated based on the transfers, i.e. when people tap into the next bus or metro station.<p>b) a probability distribution of which bus a recurring trip may fall on. It&#x27;s based on the time distribution of the recurring trips; and the headways waiting passengers are expected to encounter. If there’s few buses an hour, and the recurring trips happen at the same time, a user will use each of few buses with high probability.<p>c) the probability distribution of a passenger being on a certain (but unknown) bus at a certain (known) time. If it’s more than 20%, it counts as once per week encounter, if it’s 40% it counts as twice a week encounter, etc.<p>d) assuming you take the same bus every day, the probability that another passenger is on that bus at the same time. This depends on the number of buses operating.<p>From then on it’s a matter of summing up the probabilities to get the number of expected strangers with n=1,2,3,4 or 5 encounters per week; assuming you take the same bus every day.

Whenever the log messages start to get pretty decent in size, like, when the log messages start including tracebacks due to errors, and you have lots of errors happening back to back, like lets say high traffic is causing some deadlock exception at the DB layer or something(this was our actual problem), this high write causes BTRFS to lock up. Usually this happens because of some kind of kernel level error, our ops guy is familiar with the exact details of the exception BTRFS throws. Suffice it to say, when that happens, it&#x27;s not immediately obvious the instance is unavailable. If you have plenty of errors happening in a short time span, this behavior will start to roll across your cluster and depending if all of the hosts are running the offending container, your entire fleet of hosts will lock up. This sucks bad. The only real solution is to bounce the host machines -- though they seem to come back just fine.<p>CephFS had a similar-ish problem, where if you happened to ever own less than 3 nodes (almost always because of the above), it would have a real problem self-healing and start to get confused and re-elect bad nodes to quorum leadership, possibly clobbering all your registry data. We contributed a patch back to Deis to use S3 as a registry persistence layer because, well, having a volatile registry sucked. We were about to develop a control layer for quorum services to live on separate of the application services we were developing, and using a proxy in the quorum layer to communicate stuff like etcd. I would highly recommend this approach if you end up with any services that require a quorum.",1430836635

On the JVM, it&#x27;s startup performance is quite slow, and personally I don&#x27;t like the Java environment at all.  Furthermore, the syntax choices baffle me:  Having to specifically know when a form uses () or [] is just odd.  The &#x27;let&#x27; form stands out as a good example of Clojure&#x27;s bad language design choices.  There&#x27;s also no tail-call optimization, one has to explicitly use a &#x27;recur&#x27; form to approximate it.  I&#x27;ll stop here.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve ranted about that, here&#x27;s what I like about Clojure: The persistent data structures and the concept of transients.

But yes, there are fewer libraries generally, but people were okay with that for Clojure.  Clojure hackers wrote a whole bunch of libraries because they were excited about the power the language gave them.  If more people would recognize the immense power and value of CL and Scheme, libraries would cease to be an issue, people would write the missing bits.<p>I work on a GNU/Linux distribution written almost entirely in Scheme.

Its nice to have all these shops, but the glut of small storefronts means much lowered rents than before so a lot of fly-by-night businesses take over, and in my opinion, hurt the neighborhood like pawn shops, yet another open 4am tattoo shop, yet another shitty independent cricket/boost reseller, yet another liquor convenience store, yet another e-cig store, yet another detailing/hand carwash, yet another gourmet-style restaurant that will fold in 12 months, etc. Desireable shops like Trader Joes or Nordstrom can&#x27;t open in those tiny and no parking storefronts so its high margin retail junk.<p>This isn&#x27;t as common anymore -- thank god, but when I was a kid, every other residential block in Chicago had a corner bar.

More precisely, they match things that I personally would never want to do, but for which I do not consider it good that they be forbidden.<p>For instance, in some countries such as the UK, &quot;partaking in child pornography&quot; is interpreted as &quot;watching drawings or computer-generated imagery of sexual acts among minors&quot;, a victimless crime, which I do not feel is morally wrong. While I am not myself interested in this, I believe people have the right to create, exchange and consume such material, and I find it immoral to limit their right to do this, or to help law enforcement doing so.<p>In other countries such as France, &quot;terrorism&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;expressing support for acts such as the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks, or posting djihadist propaganda online&quot;. Once again, I believe people have the right to express such opinions, and that it is morally wrong to prosecute them for it, or help law enforcement do so.<p>Further, in many situations, cooperating with law enforcement to track illegal or immoral acts means supporting mass surveillance measures which are both inefficient for these goals and extremely dangerous for individual freedoms. So, even in situations where the acts are unquestionably morally wrong, helping law enforcement is extended to a very broad meaning with which it is possible to disagree.",1430835437

There may be a number of reasons, namely: a) The growth in exports to China; b) The long-term European crisis; c) The notion that EU countries are an already conquered market, with little penetration growth left.<p>Regardless of reasons, Germany&#x27;s behaviour is clear: The 2011 crisis presented Germany with a unique opportunity to lead Europe. Germany could have financially supported Euro-bonds, leveraging this support to mandate fiscal policy in countries that bought said bonds. This would have effectively placed Germany in a leader role for fiscal policy. Even if this had to formally be done by EU institutions, those with the money have the power. This had virtually no costs for Germany. In a success scenario would be a cash-positive move, as it&#x27;d be acting as a development bank: borrowing cheap on one end, lending with a margin on the other, with the added bonus of Euro-wide fiscal policy control.<p>By skipping this clear opportunity, Germany has signaled it is not interested in further developing the EU. I think this is a strategic mistake with a multi-decade horizon. The opportunity presented by the 2011 crisis won&#x27;t happen again. Worse, there is now the very real scenario that monetary pressures, coupled with a Grexit trigger will breakup the Euro area and really weaken the EU.",1430834737

You CAN design it so the agent cannot see the whole password, but that means the agent cannot use common sense to account for differences in spelling, or interpretation e.g. &quot;to&quot; as 2, to, two, and too (plus &quot;the third digit of your password&quot; is hard for humans, we aren&#x27;t designed that way).<p>People saying things like: &quot;an agent cannot be trusted!&quot; Are missing the point, that the entire system is built on agent trust. When you call you&#x27;re purposely giving this agent access to your account, making the password useless, there&#x27;s no proof they logged off when you hang up, there&#x27;s also no proof that they aren&#x27;t writing down your responses and will then relay it to another agent later.<p>A lot of people who whine about plain text in particular don&#x27;t really seem to understand what it is that hashing even does. They seem to think things like: &quot;if you get hacked, someone cannot steal passwords&quot; (nope) or &quot;then someone cannot sniff your password over free wifi&quot; (nope). All hashing does is add time between the hack, and when the hacker can start using the stolen credentials, that&#x27;s it. It is there to give the company time to detect the leak and to notify/reset, if the company fails to detect then it has done absolutely nothing of worth.<p>To be honest I find &quot;HTTP offenders&quot; (e.g. HTTP web-sites that redirect to HTTPS login forms, essentially breaking HTTPS&#x27;s MitM protections) far worse than &quot;plain text offenders.&quot; But none of this has anything to do with calling out security issues at this point.

This is what I hate about the uber-politically correct attitudes popular here. If we weren&#x27;t discussing legal pot, we would be discussing how illegal pot is ruining the black community. Now that we&#x27;re legalizing pot, we can&#x27;t just pretend this isn&#x27;t a win for them. Hell, its a net win for every socio-economic group in my opinion.<p>Not to mention suburban white kids weren&#x27;t getting shit from the cops to begin with. They were getting breaks or their parents&#x27; wealth and influence kept them out of trouble if they did actually run afoul of the law.<p>> 80-90% want to keep everything else illegal. That is a problem.<p>No its not. Strongly physically addictive drugs cause social harm. We&#x27;re not legalizing heroin or cocaine or meth. The number of people who consider those drugs harmless that need to be made legal immediately are a tiny extremist minority with zero political power. That&#x27;s the system working the same way its working now to make pot legal because attitudes have changed greatly in the past few decades.<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out with things like MDMA and psychedlics, but we need to make baby steps first with pot. Pretending legal pot is bad policy just because you can&#x27;t buy a gallon of liquid acid at Walmart is asinine. I think so many internet commentors have internalized negativity for things like upvotes and attention that they literally cannot applaud a good thing when its happening.  Its sad to see all these sour attitudes here at HN and reddit.  The realistic alternative here isn&#x27;t some paradise of legal everything; its more drug war nonsense. This is our first step to stop the drug war. It should be applauded as such.",1430834622
9492512,comment,9491313,9492207,0,0,erikb,,,"Yes, we agree that adding unspecified handling results in the system being in an unspecified state. It&#x27;s also a good thinking that every system is a sub system of another system, so at some point a crash is meaningful because it tells the higher level system that something went wrong and the higher level system should know that so that it can start to handle the error.<p>The problem space which I like to add is the scenario in which the higher level system is a human.<p>In a sense humans are like old code, they do odd things, are unable to specify their expectations and sometimes prioritize expectations that are utterly wrong. But we as smart programmers, who want to succeed with our program, can not be satisfied with &quot;scientifically correct&quot; code. We need to produce code that humans use. Therefore we can not always crash when entering unspecified states. That&#x27;s not &quot;cowboy coding&quot;, that&#x27;s handling the imperfection of the higher level system. Sometimes the additional error handler is good, because the crash itself is worse than an undefined state.",1430834616

Discovering exceptions to the rigid belief structures I was being taught in school (and honeslty, even at university) was one of the things that made me stop believing in formal education (and realizing some of the teachers have no fucking clue what they&#x27;re talking about). Teaching is not about forcing kids to memorize a bunch of facts; it&#x27;s about creating mental models.

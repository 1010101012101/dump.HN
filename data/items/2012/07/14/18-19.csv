4244997,comment,4244770,4244770,12,0,gfodor,,,"Best point of the article is that you need to keep in mind your 'leverage' as owner of a product when implementing large scale changes. In Digg's case, the community had all the leverage: they posted links to content, curated the content, provided the pageviews for advertisers, and spent the time making the site great. In return, Digg had little leverage at all to cause users to stay if they pissed them off sufficiently.<p>Facebook and Twitter have leverage: their content is user-generated, and cannot be found elsewhere, this combined with their social graphs make it so if you switched you will not be seeing content from a majority of the people you know or care about any longer. Marketplaces like eBay and Craigslist have enormous leverage: eBay can push out a feature that pisses off 100% of their sellers, but sellers go where the buyers are, and the buyers are on eBay. Google has leverage over its advertisers for the same reason, though it's hard to think of how Google has leverage over its main audience, which is a testament to their cautiousness when messing with the search engine (at least until recently!)<p>I think this aspect is lost when you have sites like TechCrunch telling product people to just forge ahead and break stuff. Break stuff, sure, but remember that when Facebook break things and users eventually come crawling back, its certainly not due to loyalty or warm-fuzzy feelings but due to leverage. Do you have that kind of leverage?",1342291886

4244993,comment,4238254,4242899,0,0,drostie,,,"Look, I understand that you have a stake in this. I get that. I am also male. I understand that you might want to look out for male interests in a sort of economic sense.<p>Nonetheless, what you are saying is deeply misguided and shows that you don't know what sexism became in the 20th century and looks like today. You are struggling too hard to make some sort of point. In doing this you are failing to come to a common ground and to understand the Other. I know this well; I have been there. I implore you to make one last effort.<p>Let us start from some common ground: women are granted a great deal of courtesy because they are in some sense 'overvalued'. The question you should ask is, <i>how are they being overvalued, exactly</i>? And the answer I think is, ""they are being overvalued <i>as romantic objects</i>."" It's a common thread with roots in that Shakespearean sort of ideal, the Quiet, Pure Woman who Knows Her Place and is Walled Away and must be Wooed by her Romeo. It plays forth in all of the behaviours you have insisted upon: that we would pay for dinner, buy them drinks, arrange the wedding, extend them romantic courtesies, forgive them their outbursts, et cetera. It is also the reason that they are discouraged from the club scene and thus can be whisked past the line.<p>This is our common ground. Now what you must understand is that this position is not <i>merely</i> a position of privilege, but is also deeply <i>dehumanizing</i>. Look at those words again: romantic ""object"". The same attitude which makes her <i>precious</i> also makes her little more than <i>ornamental</i>. And this is a story played out through most of our history, until several extremely noteworthy women in the Victorian Era decided ""hey, screw that--we can be writers and mathematicians and factory workers as well."" Of course, this soon after intersected with the Suffragettes, the World Wars and the Sexual Revolution. It was only very recently that women got the right to vote and the right to attend school -- much less the right to wear 'immodest' dress or the right to be a witch.  For a long time they simply were not treated as <i>human</i> but rather as <i>subhuman</i>.<p>Sexism is simply that: it names these social institutions which treat women as a whole as subhuman. There are still many such institutions. Many of them come from this same Romantic Object Past that you are complaining about -- this is presumably why some man drunkenly licked her tattoo; he may well have thought that this might show that he was pursuing her and wooing her, in his drunken state -- in doing so he revealed that he doesn't really think of her as some independent person to be talked to, but rather some skin to be licked. They may also be inverted by the modern pornographic culture, as with the man who burst into a conversation asking for her to come to a pillow-fight essentially did the same, essentially saying ""your conversation could not possibly be as important as our idolizing you as a sex object; come on, let's do this.""<p>The bottom line is that the sexism isn't ""in favor of"" anybody, it's a deeply immature mistake that we've been carrying around from the Dark Ages to the present. It wouldn't be sexist if a female groped a man or invited him to have a pillow-fight because our institutions happen to not be geared to objectify men in this way. They objectify men in other ways though; especially in corporate culture where there is a tendency to emphasize those who neglect their families to work harder, to be cogs in a machine, to follow the orders of management. This may not be sexism -- that is, there is little reason to expect that women who join the corporate circuit are treated much differently -- but it certainly is objectification happening to men today. The pornography industry also objectifies men; in the industry men become little more than muscles, penises, and a bundle of perversions, with their stamina, girth, and virility being the most important qualities.<p>TL;DR = ""rudeness"" is not sexism, sexism is again the <i>climate</i> which generates, and is generated by, such rude acts. Key to the climate being ""sexist"" is that the climate lowers women beneath a baseline of what it is to be human. The examples you've given do not lower men beneath such a baseline, but there are cultural features which do and we should be wary towards those too, even though they tend to not be sexist <i>per se</i>.",1342291791

Why not use that data to make search extremely personalized?<p>Reasons why I like this:<p>1)  It's not like anyone currently uses facebook for search, they literally have nothing to lose.<p>2)  It would be interesting to see if the aphorism, ""Show me your friends and I'll show you your future"" holds up.<p>3)  It's data that google doesn't have access to, unless G+ takes off.<p>4)  It would be cheaper to crawl the web, essentially your users are your web crawlers.<p>Take the same graph theory algorithms used for backlinks and apply it to views and instead of page rank use time that their friends spend on the site.<p>Then you can do some interesting stuff like weight the page rank more heavily for individuals you interact with more.<p>Or super creepy (but statistically interesting) stuff could be done like if you want someone to reconnect with a friend they haven't spoken to in a while, weight the ""long lost friend's"" pages more heavily.

4244954,comment,4243995,4243995,14,0,cruise02,,,"> Another thing that resonated deeply with me was how Newton studied a book by a French mathematician (I dont remember which one): he started reading the book  when he found it too hard, he started over. Thats what he did until he understood the whole thing. So, he didnt go and read something more basic, or tried to found someone who could explain it. He just stayed with the source until he groked it.<p>Approach this advice with caution.  Yes, it might work great if you're working with a great book that has good coverage of all the fundamentals of the topic and presents it in a logical order.  Many books don't do this.  Starting over when you get stuck can just throw you into an endless loop if the required information just isn't in the book you picked to learn from.  Know when to branch out to other sources of information instead of looping back.  Don't be afraid to make a quick interlude to Wikipedia if you need to.<p>(Personally, I prefer to just backtrack to the information I missed instead of starting over from scratch.  Starting over seems to waste a lot of time, but if you missed one concept, there's a chance you missed more.)",1342291019

Now I personally believe that advertising has done an enormous amount of good for the world by providing services for free that otherwise couldn't be free, which is actually much more important for the developing world (GMail being free matters much more to a user in Africa than it does to a user in the US, generally speaking). But I'm certainly not working on a big idea.<p>It's interesting to see some of the responses here. They are in some cases quite defensive and/or dismissive of this observation. Some of the defenses raised:<p>1. Deferred altruism: ""I'm making the easy money now but I'll (work on big ideas,give back,etc) later.""<p>I question the sincerity of these statements. For one thing, human nature is funny when it comes to money. How much is enough? Most of us here aren't independently wealthy so we probably think several million dollars will do, tens of millions will be plenty. I bet you'll find many people with that kind of net worth still thinking they're poor and they need to make more. It's probably an easy trap to fall into.<p>People think money won't change them. For most people it does.<p>More to the point, the biggest motivator is the need to succeed. One reason startups are successful is it's either succeed or die. Necessity is the mother of invention and all that. I truly believe you're much more motivated and productive when your (financial) life depends on it. If you're wealthy, most of the time you're just not going to be as motivated. It's a rare individual that is the exception.<p>2. Big problems are hard/expensive.<p>No actually they're not. Some are, sure. Thorium reactors would be an expensive problem.<p>A lot of other problems in the fields of machine learning, bioinformatics, etc are largely just software problems. Computing power continues to get exponentially cheaper. The Khan Academy is a big idea with very little costs to entry or operational costs.<p>3. ""This is happening in other areas too!""<p>Who cares? You're not responsible for anyone's behaviour other than your own. Plus of course two wrongs don't make a right.<p>I get the desire to strike it rich. I really do. There's nothing wrong with that. It seems disingenuous--even dishonest--to suggest there is a deeper altruistic motive. Most of the time there isn't.<p>I don't see Kara's comments (or mine for that matter) as a criticism of the motives of any particular individual or company, merely a lament that society as a whole places such value on what are really shallow desires and distractions. I'm sure it'd be harder to get funding for something as unsexy as, say, protein folding than it would be for creating a social network for cats and that really is sad.",1342290582

However, if by chance these ideas do make it to a main stage then more times than not they are summarily ridiculed/discredited.

People are more likely to attack that which they don't understand, rather than give a new viewpoint the proper time to be digested and then considered as a valid opinion.<p>Just because someone says I have a better form of health care, democracy, capitalism, or any other 'Big Idea' that's needed, and they want to introduce it to the world.

And that is, when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use. And indeed, on some absolute scale of things, we probably know less about the essence of computer science than the ancient Egyptians really knew about geometry.<p>Well, what do I mean by the essence of computer science? What do I mean by the essence of geometry? See, it's certainly true that these Egyptians went off and used surveying instruments, but when we look back on them after a couple of thousand years, we say, gee, what they were doing, the important stuff they were doing, was to begin to formalize notions about space and time, to start a way of talking about mathematical truths formally. hat led to the axiomatic method. That led to sort of all of modern mathematics, figuring out a way to talk precisely about so-called declarative knowledge, what is true.<p>Well, similarly, I think in the future people will look back and say, yes, those primitives in the 20th century were fiddling around with these gadgets called computers, but really what they were doing is starting to learn how to formalize intuitions about process, how to do things, starting to develop a way to talk precisely about how-to knowledge, as opposed to geometry that talks about what is true.""<p>Ideas do not have to be earth shaking breakthroughs to push the human race forward.

Being a fanboy (= mindlessly defending the platform, no matter what) has nothing to do with longevity of which you're using that platform.<p>It always reminds me of this: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/17/cuban"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/17/cuban</a><p>I'm an Apple user and love both platforms, and agree with what you said completely.

There's nothing wrong with google, but it already exists, and we don't need another one.<p>Wikipedia is fundamentally based on editing. Deleting pages is just one aspect -- what about removing paragraphs? I think my paragraph is important, so I add it near the top of a page. You think the paragraph is completely useless and want to remove it entirely. What do we do? Remove the paragraph, keep it, or move it down the page?<p>You also don't address a lot of obvious problems, like namespace issues. If the policy is not to delete anything, then there will be more articles and greater ambiguity. I like the fact that, when I use wikipedia, it usually goes to the right place immediately or offers a short list of ways to disambiguate.",1342288927

Many article authors are intellectually interested in their subjects, but not <i>personally</i> connected to them. For example, there's a difference between writing a Wikipedia article on a mathematical theorem you consider beautiful and important; and writing a Wikipedia article on a mathematical theorem that you personally discovered and published. In both cases you care a lot about the subject, but in the second case it may be better to let a third party who's less personally close to it write the article.<p>(Interestingly, this almost never comes up in the mathematics articles. There are quite a few mathematicians who edit Wikipedia, and they tend to be quite scrupulous about that kind of thing.)",1342288835

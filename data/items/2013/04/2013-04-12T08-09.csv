That should already be well understood when we call these things ""microbenchmarks"" and not ""benchmarks"". Meanwhile, compare all of the LevelDB/Kyoto/SQLite3 results we reported to the results the LevelDB authors originally reported - you'll find they are directly comparable. It may well be that read tests whose data sets are already fully cached in RAM are not representative of the underlying media speed. But (1) we're just trying to produce numbers using the same methodology as the original LevelDB benchmarks and (2) the full results show that even with all data fully cached in RAM, the type of underlying filesystem still had dramatic effects on the performance of each library.<p>We've done another bench recently (not yet prettied up for publication) with a VM with 32GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores. On an LDAP database with 5 million entries, the full DB occupies 9GB of RAM and this VM can return 33,000 random queries/second ad nauseum. Scaling the DB up to 25 million entries, the DB requires 40GB of RAM and the random query rate across all 25M drops down to around 20,000/sec. Tests like these are more about the price/quality of your hard drive than the quality of your software. As publishable results they're much less referenceable since any particular site's results will have much greater variance, and the only thing for a conscientious party to do is measure it on their own system anyway.",1365756685

Seriously WTF?<p>Fact: there are <i>plenty</i> of currency/commodity markets (1) that the US government does not control and (2) that are used sometimes for illegal activities such as laundering, and yet the US government is perfectly fine with these markets existing and being legal because they are necessary for a healthy economy and are <i>mostly</i> used for legal activity. Two examples: gold (obviously the US does not ""control"" worldwide gold trades, and yet gold is often used for laundering), and foreign currencies (perfectly legal to hold and trade in the US, even those from countries with strained relationships with the US such as the Iranian rial, Burmese kyat, etc).<p>Supporting my viewpoint, the US Treasury Department, through FinCEN, has recently tacitly approved Bitcoin: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/is-bitcoin-legal-2013-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/is-bitcoin-legal-2013-4</a> It is obviously in the US' interest to let the Bitcoin economy grow, and merely get revenues from it by taxing trades, capital gains, etc.<p>This is not the first time I explain all this.",1365754923

Or paid $250 (in BTC again) of ever. With an expect return of 5 BTC per year and 6 BTC per year respectively. The site offered 6000 slots available and the machine would be up by June.<p>My problem with that is it seems just like a scam. They are making $900,000 up front in an untraceable currency. They are proposing that you'll get an annual return of $720 at yesterdays rates.<p>My gut tells me that if its sounds too good to be true it generally is.<p>Gold has value in that it can be made into something, bitcoins have value only because of the perceived value. How is bitcoin different from the ponzi membership badge I have? What is going to make bitcoin still worth something in 10 years time, as in what's holding its value up other than perception?",1365754882

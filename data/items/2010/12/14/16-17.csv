2004780,comment,2004512,2004512,0,0,Zak,,,"In ""The Hundred-Year Language""[0], PG elaborates on what it is to be a successful programming language, and what he thinks will happen to Java. PG predicts that Java will be an evolutionary dead-end without much influence on future languages, like COBOL[1].<p>Let's look at what Java has influenced. C# is fairly obvious, but that too is likely a dead-end. I don't (personally) know any good hackers who are excited about C#. Actionscript and PHP seem to have been inspired by Java in their object systems. I don't think either has or will influence future systems, except perhaps as examples of how not to do it. Scala and Clojure show some Java influence, but it's not very strong. That influence is primarily in the form of compromises required for running on the JVM platform, which probably won't be around in its current form in a few decades.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a><p>[1] COBOL influenced the syntax of SQL, but I can't think of much else a hacker today would use voluntarily that was influenced by COBOL.",1292345999

The video chat through google talk is icing on the cake.<p>I can't get rid of my 'real' laptop because I need to interface with other hardware like my Arduino, etc.  But for emailing and reading my news feed I like the Cr-48.  Would the same purpose be served by a different netbook?  Probably but I don't have one of those to compare to.<p>And my experience with fast user switching on windows is totally different from yours.  Maybe it's the age of the laptop and not having an SSD but it's not even something I consider doing it's so slow.

You are absolutely correct: Obama ""seemed"" to get his money from small contributions by individuals.  Many (most?) Americans shared a common perception of the ""image"" of powerful special interest groups financing his opponents (both primary and general).  I am very skeptical of this.  I would very much like to see some actual numbers on the share of his campaign dollars which came from small donors vs. large contributors, and how he stacked up against his opponents and previous presidential candidates.  I strongly suspect that he was more or less average, and that these perceptions were the result of very good marketing by his campaign (which is more or less what political campaigns are supposed to do).  Unfortunately, I think that sorting out which of his contributions came from large or small sources will prove incredibly difficult because of the lack of quality control in his contribution acceptance system:<p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/22/opinion/main4538537.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/22/opinion/main453853...</a><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/10/AR2008101002989.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10...</a>",1292343701

Just where does the Linux-lockdown start providing real, actual benefits you don't get elsewhere?<p>I'm not saying you must be <i>wrong</i> or mistaken, but what I do suggest is that there are normal use-cases which will benefit from having local-storage and applications and that I see absolutely no use-cases where having the local option completely blocked and removed provides any benefits.<p>Your ""google laptop"" is my Windows-laptop.

Every weekend I drove my '92 Blazer to the ski hill at 5am, clocked in, parked cars in the freezing cold, then drove a shuttle bus until the afternoon shift came on.  I also worked on Christmas and New Year's Day since those tend to be big ski days.<p>One Christmas, I got off work around 2pm.  I was driving home to open presents, have dinner, etc. when I came across a delivery van on the side of the road, hopelessly spinning its wheels in about 2 feet of heavy snow.  It looked as if they had pulled over to get out of the way or check their map and gotten stuck.<p>I turned around and pulled up across the highway from them.  ""Need some help?"" I shouted.  The dirty, scruffy driver who was digging at the wheels with his foot glared at me, ""No dammit!  We're fine.""<p>I got back in my car and sat and watched for a minute.  He jumped in the van and took some anger out on the gas pedal, digging himself even deeper in.  I calmly turned around, backed my car up to about 15 feet in front of his van, stepped out, and stood there with a tow-strap in my hand watching him.<p>Finally, he got out, gruffly accepted the other end of the strap from me, and hooked it up to his van.  I got in my Blazer, set it to 4-Lo and pulled him out of the snow and onto the pavement in about 2 seconds flat.<p>""Thanks,"" he said.  ""No problem.  Merry Christmas."" I said as I rolled the snatch strap back up.  Then he reached into his pocket, ""Here.  Take this.<p>""No way,"" I said.  ""It's Christmas.  Get home safe.""<p>""Absolutely not!  It's wear and tear on your vehicle."" he growled.  Figuring I had probably hurt this guy's pride enough already, I just took what was in his hand, wished him a Merry Christmas again, and got back in my car.  I threw the money on the seat next to me: three one-dollar bills.<p>I smiled and laughed all the way home.  I made sure to drop those three dollar bills into the next donation box I saw.",1292342439

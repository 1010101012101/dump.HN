I get that; he's said it before.<p>But I never quite manage to understand <i>exactly</i> what he proposes to substantially replace the existing legal and semantic structure. If I make something that doesn't have a particular physical manifestation, what rights and obligations do I have to that creation?<p>I <i>think</i> that, when pressed, many people who sympathize with Doctorow in this debate would assert that a thing that has no physical manifestation conveys no rights to its creator. But I wish they would come out and say that directly, instead of dancing around the issue while making essentially content-free semantic arguments.",1204131468

124822,story,,,22,6,scw,"My startup functional equivalent, mapping human impacts on the ocean",,"I'm one of the authors on a paper published in Science Magazine on mapping human impacts on the ocean, this is my first publication and I've been excited to see the process. A number of my coworkers and I are fans of PG's work, I thought it would be interesting to examine our project from a start-up perspective:<p>Human capital: 
First, we had an amazing 'long view' leader who ran the show. He saw the project at a higher level of abstraction, could understand the details but didn't get bogged down in them. The work was both motivating and inspiring, this intrinsic motivation is critical to finishing a project of this scope (4 years in duration).<p>Requires dedication and sacrifice from the key participants, all of which is much easier to gain when you're working on a consciousness raising activity that gets people up in the morning.<p>Required deep negotiation to collaborate with data providers, having someone who can drive these talks is key.  A mental map of the data landscape is similarly important: where can you use public data, and reuse what has already been done?<p>Requires you can learn new skills as you go along and perform tasks well outside your area of expertise. Constant learning isn't optional.<p>Filling a need: 
On many levels, but key is understanding how we effect our planet.  Having a clear way to communicate your idea mattered, in our case a map: 
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/25/science/earth/20080225_COAST_GRAPHIC.html<p>Getting the job done:<p>Your initial idea is nothing like the final result: the seed question turned out to be the wrong one, and the project shifted in response. Ideas are cheap, but good implementations are expensive.<p>Scaling is critical, constantly amassing new data to improve the analysis, and tuning what you're measuring. Running the model once after optimization took 18 hours, we scaled horizontally to compute Monte Carlo simulations.<p>Much guidance provided by highly experienced participants early on in the project, helping shape it and form critical networking links, similar to the role played by YC. Rely on existing relationships when you need help, and look to others who can help.  Going it alone has merit, but rely on existing relationships for help when you can. Ultimately what matters is getting the job done.<p>Positive feedback is a strong motivator, which is good as high levels of motivation are necessary to beat out both internal and external obstacles. Capital is limited: this is the economic law of gravity, bootstrap or climb your way out of it.<p>Where it differs:<p>Do everything yourself: would be nigh impossible without heavy collaboration and synthetic effort, blazing your own trail wouldn't get you to the same endpoint.  Strong bilateral agreements are the only thing that flies here.<p>Release early, release often: while internal updates to the group were critical, the system doesn't reward openness early in a project, and the public face is nothing till the publication date.<p>The business model: in a startup, you have hard numbers to measure returns. Science measures returns in indirect ways, and the time scale for realizing those returns is generally much longer. Traffic isn't a good metric for this project, but is interesting: in two weeks, our website has seen 30k uniques, with another 22k uniques to the KML file. These results were mostly due to the press coverage from big players such as NYT, NPR, NatGeo, MSNBC and a few social media sites.<p>Our project website:

I'm an entrepreneur myself and moved to San Diego (from NY) almost 2 years ago.<p>I was working on a startup coming out here and the beach and weather did not help me focus (but other distractions including living with my college friends directly ON the beach).<p>That aside you can find like minded people, but it is much MUCH MUCH harder.  I've joined a couple startup groups on meetup.com and actually that is how my current partner and I met.  But I haven't been to any meetups since.<p>Personally, the weather is beautiful and does give me inspiration, but I wouldn't sacrifice all the resources that you would get in SV.<p>... one pro to San Diego aside from the weather might be if you do have a somewhat successful startup here you may get more attention since there are so few.

124812,comment,108433,108463,0,0,lispcast,,,"I think by aiming toward brevity, what he is actually aiming for is the ability to refactor code into something more brief.<p>The idea is that by ensuring the progression of long code becoming shorter, and by upholding his second principle (axiomaticity), he is making sure that the code he does factor out will be useful to future programmers.  He is removing the need to write common boilerplate code -- and giving the ability to remove boilerplate code to all programmers.<p>And that supports the idea that PG likes about Lisp -- that the language evolves with the program.  The reason it seems to only be good for web programs is that his principle application is a web program.  If he were to work on some other kind of program, say a word processor, you would see different kinds of abstractions.<p>The point is that the language can be adapted to ANY kind of application.  That is what he is aiming for.  And that's why he doesn't want you to have to count library import statements.  He wants to compare the code you have to write repeatedly, not the once-off code.  He is claiming that the code you have to write repeatedly indicates how expressive a language is.  If you have to repeat yourself, then the language does not adequately represent the abstraction you want to capture.<p>That's what _On Lisp_ is about.  That's what basically all of his Lisp essays are about.  Paul Graham is aiming for brevity so that he knows that any programmer can make their program brief by evolving the language.  Brevity is a sign of a tight fit between language and the concepts expressed in the program.",1204129735

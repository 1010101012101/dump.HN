It compromises clojure's awesome data structures and embraces native JS data structures to be a better at cooperation with JS. Goal of wisp is to present a subset of clojure(script) language such that packages written in wisp can be consumed natively by wisp, clojure(script) and JS when compiled, without data marshalling or any code changes.<p>While I do like clojure(script) a lot I don't think it makes too hard to consume data structures from JS land and makes consuming data produced by clojure(script) awkward for consumption on the JS side. That is a the reasonable compromise for a great power, it's just I think I'd rather leverage JS data structures in immutable manner directly and provide more clojure like data structures in form of libraries. This would allow users to make best (or maybe worst) choices based on their constraints.<p>As of lispyscript it's nice project and as a matter of fact wisp is just a fork that never got merged in to upstream. I was convinced that clojure (or any other known lisp) syntax was better option than yet another new lisp. In addition I wanted full macros that unlike wisp lispyscript does not has. Also lispyscript has no lists, instead it uses arrays and I can continue this list over and over...<p>> But why would you want Clojure syntax without Clojure semantics? Especially since Clojure syntax implies several data types that JavaScript can't provide natively. It just doesn't make sense...<p>JS can do it otherwise clojurescript won't be possible, I just think these data types can be exposed via optional libraries as they have associated cost in terms of performance overhead and learning curve.<p>And to be quite honest I do hope that a lot of wisp parts will find it's way to clojurescript, it's just contributing to clojurescript turned out to be harder than bootstraping own version, since even pull requests for travis-ci integration tests require lot's of justification.",1370053562

If people have no reason to be scared of prisons, what keeps a huge number of people from just giving up on ever doing anything economically productive and instead just shoplift or burglarize whenever they want/need something and don't have enough money for it, because they know that once they're caught they can just take it easy and sit in jail playing video games all day?

I certainly don't want to go to jail, and I've made a habit of noting gray areas in the law where behavior I intuitively think of as ""reasonable"" is actually illegal, and how you should conduct yourself around law enforcement officials to minimize your chances of going to prison (in the US, you should never help them in any way, never lie to them or physically resist them in any way, refuse consent to all searches, and decline to speak with them unless you have the advice of a lawyer who represents you and will be present during the questioning.)<p>Neither he nor I say that rape and torture is the only possible way to make prisons scary.

Not everyone has the intellectual ability to be a doctor or a web developer (especially given our dismal education system), and there are only a limited number of low-skill non-relocatable jobs like food service or retail.  Things were much better for people with limited education when labor unions had a monopoly on many unskilled jobs and could set monopoly pricing on wages.  Now, with tariffs and high shipping costs no longer keeping manufacturers from moving overseas, competition from workers in desperately poor countries is forcing wages downward; when the going rate for a given job falls below the US minimum wage, those jobs simply disappear from the US entirely.<p>Unfortunately, global corporations who benefit from the situation have too much influence over US politics, opponents of this aspect of the status quo are too disorganized, and the analysis I outlined above is not widely enough accepted for change to happen in the near term.",1370052282

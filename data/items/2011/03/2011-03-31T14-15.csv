Sorry but if hw like the iPad is built well enough and with enough hw options, then that's enough of a reason to build apps for it, in advance of any sales.<p>Google is always playing the catchup game, being slow and patient and then storming the market with new devices whenever they feel ready.",1301583592

I love Steve's work, but he has a tendency to over-generalize, systematize, and the regurgitate whatever he's been absorbing. It's a great habit, and it helps tremendously to advance the conversation along, but it can lead folks to believe there's a lot more surety in his conclusions than there actually is. Great structure and descriptions are a key part of finding a solution, but they are not a solution in themselves.<p>If we agree that art plays a huge role here, then the next logical question is: <i>how do you teach people to be a good artist?</i><p>I'm not a guy who believes you are just ""born with it"".

2391812,comment,2391489,2391489,7,0,zacharypinter,,,"There's a few background issues here to acknowledge:<p>* The honeycomb emulator is pretty much unusable for development. It's beyond slow, meaning that any sort of practical development is going to need a physical device. Compare this to the iPad emulator, which is snappy and very usable for development without needing an actual iPad.<p>* The xoom has been out for a month, but it wasn't until last Sunday that you could buy a wifi-only version and avoid paying the Verizon tax. Several people (myself included) eagerly bought xooms on Sunday in order to start developing.<p>* The app situation is grim, but it isn't as grim as the article leads you to believe. Android apps are already built with resizable layouts due to the device fragmentation everybody talks about. As such, most phone apps scale reasonably well even if they haven't been updated for tablets. This is a far better situation than the 2x scaling of iPhone apps on the iPad.<p>So, while there are reasons that honeycomb development has been stalled up until this point, those reasons are quickly disappearing, making it a great time to start developing.",1301583310
2391811,comment,2390980,2391531,10,0,dkersten,,,"Well, <i>inside</i> a function, you can have as much imperative code as you like, with mutable local variables and what-not, the function overall is still pure as long as it does not cause side-effects.<p>Eg, functional code could looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    foo a b = if a < b then quux (map bar a) else b
</code></pre>
while a pure imperative function could look something like this:<p><pre><code>    int foo (string a, int b) { // since a is passed by value, mutating it below will not modify the original
        if (a < b) {
            for (int idx=0; idx<a.length; ++idx) {
                a[idx] = bar(a[idx]);

        } else {
            return b;
        }         
    }
</code></pre>
Obviously this example is contrived and dumb, but both do the same thing and, besides the syntax difference, the first is written in a functional style, the second in an imperative style, but both are still <i>pure</i> (as long as bar and quux are also pure).<p>So you <i>can</i> mix functional and imperative without making functions impure.",1301583306

Our world is full of information and culture on how to be good performers, not creators. Even when we do our best to share with each other what works or doesn't work, we do it in terms of performance -- exactly the opposite paradigm from what's needed.<p>Took me a long, long time to figure that out, and I still have a hard time with it.

We set up an online community and folks drop by to share and talk.<p>To put it in Steve's terms, the things on the online community would all be about <i>performing</i>, not <i>creating</i>. They'd have to be. That's the nature of how text works. We'd be talking about the various kinds of pianos, oddball musical scales and their effects on voice harmonization, how to deal with agents, controversies and scandals inside the music industry, or what our work habits are like -- exactly the kinds of article you see on HN everyday.<p><i>But none of that shit is important</i> -- or maybe it's better to say that _all_ of it is important, but only in how hundreds or thousands of these little pieces comes together to make a greater whole that's uniquely assembled by each entrepreneur, not in themselves. It's all details and shop-talk. People dropping by who also want to be great composers can easily drift into the idea that somehow these ancillary things are critical parts of what it takes to be a great artist. ""John Williams was great. Did you see that sequencing tool he is using?"" subtly becomes ""If you want to write great music, you'll need a great sequencing tool"" which then becomes ""Top 20 sequencing tools to make your music shine"" Then a hundred people read this and drift off and spend 3 months learning sequencing tools instead of learning how to write tunes that people love. This can be very harmful.<p>We're out in tools, gossip, and implementation-land when the key problem is learning how to create something people want. It's a creation problem, not an implementation problem. Nobody who knows what they are doing cares what kind of stool Beethoven sat on everyday while he was writing his Ninth Symphony. And those who do care either realize how microscopically insignificant it is, or are sadly ignorant of anything to do with composing.<p>This. This is why HN can only ever have very limited value to a person who wants their own startup. It's not the people, or the Arc program structure, or the even the topics that get submitted and upvoted. <i>It's that you don't teach creativity by sitting around talking and reading about it</i>. In almost every art, it's a mentor-apprentice, tell-share-do-observe-create-influence paradigm, not passive absorption of technical details and performance-related tips. This is one of the reasons the cofounder concept is so powerful, it's the reason that incubators help more than do-it-yourself-guys, it's the reason larger communities like SV end up spawning off so many crazily-unique ideas.",1301582856

It's this approach that Google are going to strengthen - essentially if you don't obey their rules you won't be a select partner and you won't get early access to the new releases.<p>What this means is that if you don't obey Google's rules you'll be getting the software two or three months later than your competitors (and without all the support they will be getting), likely receiving it around the time they're actually bringing products to market. That's a pretty big competitive disadvantage if you're aiming to compete at anything close to the top end of the market.<p>So basically while you can use Android as you wish, if you don't obey Google's rules then you won't be able to do so in a way that allows you to be competitive.<p>The cynic in me says that this is getting mighty close to being open in name only.",1301582856

Android's emulator is a full virtualized stack and runs significantly slower than the target platform, making it hard to get a real idea of how well your program is running.<p>Hence, while you could be pretty confident releasing a day one iPad app, many android devs would balk at the same situation with Honeycomb. A lot of devs may be waiting for a different tablet than the Xoom as well, while Apple devs obviously could all buy theirs on day one.<p>The Xoom and 3.0.0 honeycomb both feel a bit rushed, there is probably a good argument for calling it a preview out here in reality.

So, people tend to set the AV software to scanning a folder full of known samples and judging the software on how many it detected (this is a nice, easy metric: you can make bar graphs out of it!) - in this situation, if chucking in a signature for C:\windows\SL gives you an easy extra malware detection at the cost of a false positive (that no reviewer's going to spot anyway), it's a no brainer.",1301581172

That would hugely drive up the street price and result in a net decrease in usage.",1301580460

Back in the 1990's,  Mark Newman and I were both working at Cornell and both of us were aware that the techniques physicists were using to evaluate power law distributions were bogus.  Well,  I was a timid grad student and,  despite being one of the best physicists of his generation who already had written half of an excellent textbook and had a stellar research record,  Mark was a postdoc who spent most of his two years in absolute anguish about how he was going to find his next job.<p>Mark wrote a paper about this ten years later,  after physicists had published thousands of bogus papers using bogus statistics.  It's a tragedy that neither Mark, myself or some other young turk didn't write it earlier -- and it wouldn't have been hard to do it all because it would mainly be a review paper of what was already in the statistics literature.",1301580272

I'm convinced that thrust reverser would (in principle at least, construction details be damned) work with a propeller engine.<p>In my understanding, even if the air stream was accelerated rearwards at first, and only subsequently redirected frontward, it'd still create net force pointing frontward (decelerating one), without need for increased temperature nor extra mass from burned fuel. But I don't have solid physic background; somebody please correct me.<p>It may be easier to visualize it with a ducted fan. As used on some RC aircraft models, modeled after jet-engined crafts. I believe a thrust reverser would work in such a setup, minus friction and turbulent losses.",1301580163

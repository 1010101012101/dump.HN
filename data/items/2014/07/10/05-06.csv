I have a feeling it is likely diet related, and possibly due to either the &quot;low fat&quot; craze not providing building blocks in the brain or the industrial fats (in particular trans fats but maybe the massive quantities of n-6 fats) causing structures to be built incorrectly or causing excess inflammation.<p>So, that&#x27;s my hypothesis based on having done a lot of nutrition research but no Parkinson&#x27;s research.

8013814,comment,8001337,8001755,1,0,perrylaj,,,"Just as a contrasting opinion and at risk of sounding defensive -- I&#x27;m a UCD Alum (BS in a different field) who took the lower div CSE track there.<p>ECS10 (Intro to CS using Python) was my first formal CS class.  Took it as a filler elective and was hooked.  It was definitely geared toward first-time programmers and used Python to ease into fundamental CS/Programming concepts.  I found it successful in that.<p>Following that was ECS30 which is in C and the first major-track CS class.  The difference in difficulty/workload substantial, mostly due to the introduction of things like pointers, dynamic memory allocation, etc.  But the intro class helped a lot.  From ECS30 on, it&#x27;s primarily C/C++ for OOP/Software design, Data Structs, systems, algos, etc. I don&#x27;t think Python is used much if at all in major track CS/CSE classes I can remember.<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised at the dismissive tone toward UCD&#x27;s CSE program relative to CSUS.  I&#x27;ve audited classes at CSU in consideration of applying for a master&#x27;s there, and while not outright disappointed, nor was I impressed.<p>I got the feeling that the CSUS programs are not as geared toward fundamental research and &quot;CS&quot; to the same extent as UCD and are slightly more skewed toward developing employable skill sets.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just a different goal. I also disliked the general push toward MS stacks.<p>Having peers at Cal that took I took summer sessions with at UCD, the feeling was that UCD was less challenging in the sense that there are smaller class sizes, better professor access (especially in classes taught by excellent lecturers like Sean Davis who devote lots of time to students), and less competitive nature of grade curving.  I didn&#x27;t hear anyone say it was easier, simply that it felt more collaborative.  Though, that&#x27;s not hard to imagine when they were in classes with nearly 1000k students split across two simulcast lecture halls in freshman CS classes at Cal.<p>Being in the shadow of Cal and Stanford makes it harder for UCD to get noticed, ut it has world-class faculty, smaller class sizes and great options for research.  I have friends/acquaintances that ended up at Goog, Twitter, MS, SpaceX... etc. Is it MIT, Stanford, CIT?  Perhaps no.  Is it more known for it&#x27;s Bio Sciences?  Sure.  But it&#x27;s far from the &#x27;last place&#x27; I would matriculate into for CS.<p>Just presenting (an admittedly verbose) alternative opinion.",1404971199

Is it taken for granted that a business model exists? Or is the business model some that comes with time as the startup tests their ideas?<p>Chapter 5 of the book has a section titled &quot;Strategy is Based on Assumptions&quot; which while not spelling it out seems to suggest that our &quot;leaps of faith&quot; are derived from the assumptions that are spelled out in our business plan/model.  In my understanding the goal the lean startup methodology is to put these leap of faith assumptions to the test. Therefore my best interpretation is that a business model is taken for granted and should be the foundation on which we conduct our experiments.<p>My business partner disagrees and states &quot;We need baseline numbers. We need to take a jump shot. We need to start without knowing the end, which is the exact opposite of the traditional business plan model.

In any event, one would never expect the graph to bottom out, but possibly the reason the trough doesn&#x27;t dip any lower than it does, could be that the rest of world history remains static, and picks up the slack, continuing to generate notable personalities in areas not disrupted by exploration.<p>Similarly, my intuition leans toward thinking that the long, steady, even duration of the trough might be an artifact of the nature of communication during the period, which also likely introduces a degree of delay between cause and effect.

I should also point out that I&#x27;m not suggesting that all data should always be released.  And also I&#x27;ll reiterate that it&#x27;s not just &#x27;randomwalker&#x27; I&#x27;m referring to here.  I&#x27;m disappointed that the paper he&#x27;s rebutting seems to be making the silly claim that &#x27;it&#x27;s safe&#x27; instead of &#x27;it&#x27;s a worthwhile risk&#x27;.<p>The case I&#x27;m most familiar with is the Netflix Prize.  I think I can safely say (in my semi-professional opinion) that a lot of good research was published as a result of Netflix&#x27;s decision to release the data that they did: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=netflix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=netflix</a><p>I view these publications as a public good.  It&#x27;s possible the techniques described were previously known privately, but before the contest there was no description of them in the available literature.  At the conclusion of the contest, Netflix briefly announced that they would have a second contest, which would involve the release of another data set.  In large part as a result of the press coverage of randomwalker&#x27;s work, this potential release was cancelled: <a href=""https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/paul/netflix-cancels-netflix-prize-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/paul/netflix-cancels-netf...</a><p>It&#x27;s disputable, but I feel this additional data set would have generated a similar number of good publications, inspired new research, spread knowledge, and offered a similar benefit to the public.<p>It can be argued that preventing further data releases has prevented further harm to the public.  But I think it&#x27;s important to look at the actual harm done by the release of the first dataset.  While there was some degree of potential for harm, to my knowledge no individual was actually discriminated against as a result of being identified in the data set.  By contrast, I think it is accepted that numerous individuals have been harmed by other online data breaches.  If more attention is paid to anonymous datasets than to other matters that cause actual harm, the attention is likely misguided.<p>I&#x27;d draw a parallel with the increase in airline security post-9/11.  It&#x27;s possible that confiscating oversize toiletry items and removing shoes has prevented further harm.  It&#x27;s indisputable (I think) that the additional hassle has had a negative cost to the public.  And if more people choose to drive than to fly, the net effect is likely negative.  But at least in the case of airline security, there is a clear case to be made of actual harm.  Whether the current policies are a good compromise of inconvenience and safety depends on both the risk and the reward.<p>I know less about the other cases, both for benefit and harm.   Have New York taxi drivers suffered harm as a result of the poor attempts at anonymizing the data?  Is there public benefit to the data that was released?   Have individuals been harmed by the semi-anonymized release of health records?  Was this offset by any positive effects?  This is the discussion I think we should be having, rather than simply pointing at the abstract potential for harm.",1404969313

I run a secular student organization - atheist, agnostic, secular humanist, pro-free speech, establishment clause, all that and so on. Our group is largely feminist, but for years suffered a severely lopsided gender disparity.<p>We ask ourselves &quot;is it sexist?&quot; because sometimes things that seem so obviously, ordinarily not-sexist, like a self-ascribed title, can result in a <i>sexist impact</i>. Some atheist student organizations I&#x27;ve met across the country allow personalized titles.

8013686,comment,8012722,8012722,2,0,svedlin,,,"The claim is that the term &quot;funds&quot; included in the definition of &quot;financial transaction&quot; [1] covers bitcoins.<p>&quot;Funds&quot; typically denotes cash or an asset that is highly liquid, not just anything which can be purchased or sold. Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary defines &quot;fund&quot; as a &quot;sum of money or other liquid assets established for a specific purpose.&quot;<p>Bitcoins, at this stage, are accepted almost nowhere, recognized by few people as currency, and represent a tiny, highly volatile and risky niche compared to other markets. It&#x27;s much easier to convert a used iPhone (the top search on eBay) into cash, sell concert tickets on craigslist, or trade collectibles, than it is to convert bitcoins into legal tender, but no one would mistake those goods for &quot;funds.&quot; The law isn&#x27;t intended to cover anything which can be exchanged for cash. In fact, it specifically enumerates the following types of property separately when defining the scope of &quot;financial transaction&quot;: &quot;real property, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft.&quot; [1]<p>Because currency is accepted nearly everywhere as payment, the government considers it difficult to police and subject to special penalties when used for criminal ends. Goods like collectibles or bitcoins don&#x27;t operate at that scale, since they&#x27;re accepted by relatively few businesses and specialized experts as payment. If a tiny (in comparison to the economy at large) experiment like bitcoin is &quot;funds&quot;, then almost any object bought or sold in a zillion stores and marketplaces can be construed as &quot;funds&quot;. Any quid-pro-quo could be considered laundering, which broadens the law beyond its intended scope.<p>The ruling says:<p>&quot;Ulbricht&#x27;s alleged conduct is more akin to a builder who designs a house complete with secret entrances and exits and specially designed traps to stash drugs and money; this is not an ordinary dwelling, but a drug dealer&#x27;s &#x27;dream house.&#x27;&quot; [2]<p>It&#x27;s not illegal to build a house with secret entrances and compartments. Such a house could be used by anyone who wanted to hide their own possessions on their own property. The fact that someone might use it for illicit purposes doesn&#x27;t implicate the owner or builder. It must be proved separately that the owner or builder knowingly entered into some kind of agreement with another conspirator to facilitate a crime [3]. Merely hosting a chat room isn&#x27;t a conspiracy.<p>Unfortunately, this is just a perpetuation of the same pointless drug war. The prosecution&#x27;s position is wildly overblown. The alleged activities are akin to operating a motel where a victimless offense might have been committed by a third party.<p>Drug prohibition is ineffective and is on the way out in favor of treatment and social programs that are more effective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956</a><p>(4) the term “financial transaction” means<p>(A) a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce<p>(i) involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or<p>(ii) involving one or more monetary instruments, or<p>(iii) involving the transfer of title to any real property, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, or<p>(B) a transaction involving the use of a financial institution which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce in any way or degree;<p>[...]<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/233234104/Forrest-Denial-of-Defense-Motion-in-Silk-Road-Case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/233234104/Forrest-Denial-of-Defens...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://conspiracy.uslegal.com/elements-of-the-crime/intent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conspiracy.uslegal.com/elements-of-the-crime/intent/</a>",1404968468

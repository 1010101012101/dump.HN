It's been really good.<p>Just as when I started my first job, I had to learn new skills.  As a diligent, good employee, I tried to learn quickly.  And, now, I'm probably more productive than I ever have been.<p>But, then again, I don't sit on FB or Twitter all day.  Each morning, I set out with a focused list of goals, and I try to get them done.  And, I need a quiet space.<p>The hardest part, for me, was learning when to shut off.  As an office worker, there was a natural dynamic and rhythm of the team.  When the lights started going off, or when the cleaning staff showed up, you knew that it was time to go.  But, sometimes, at home, I forget to turn off.  I think I have gotten closer to burnout, working from home.<p>Collaboration is an issue, but we work in such small teams nowadays, that there aren't as many communication channels.  Long gone are the 15-20 person teams.  Now, I work with targeted groups of 4-5.  We communicate regularly.  For more high-fidelity communication, I have face-to-face meetings with subject matter experts and stakeholders and designers maybe once a month.<p>As a software developer, I can't see how this trend can stop.  With the state of things, I will never again have all the people that I need in the same office every day.  Skills are just too specialized now.  And, services are specialized.  To get everyone (and all their dependencies) in the same office would mean sacrificing a lot of quality and agility.",1362416295

If you were picking the ""right"" level of taxation, you'd presumably want it to set it somewhere near the point where the economic cost of the taxes was equal to the benefits of the government's use of the revenue, and not at the point of maximum revenue.<p>A 70% marginal rate is not outrageously far from where the top bracket in California will be if Washington decides the best Social Security reform includes lifting the payroll tax cap. Today's effective top marginal rate in CA is ~52% in Fed+State income taxes and another 3.8% for the high-earner Medicare tax. If SS goes uncapped, adding another 12.4%, your $1M earner is hitting 68.2%.

It could be a great opportunity to mold people by the masses so that they can really appreciate the culture and get involved in the business of technology.

I can't remember font rendering shittier than Google's PDF viewer in the last decade, and that's going back to GTK 1.x here. It's a cute trick that's helpful in a pinch, but it still sucks compared to even shitty native Office competitors.<p>[1] It's telling that arguably the most well-known YC company's product is fundamentally based on making it easy to integrate native apps with cloud storage.",1362415588

5319028,story,,,2,0,p4checo,"Ask HN: Am I using C++11 atomic release-consume ordering correctly?",,"I have recently made a port to C++11 using std::atomic of a triple buffer to be used as a concurrency sync mechanism.
The idea behind this thread sync approach is that for a producer-consumer situation where you have a producer that is running faster that the consumer, triple buffering can give some benefits since the producer thread won't be ""slowed"" down by having to wait for the consumer.
In my case, I have a physics thread that is updated at ~120fps, and a render thread that it running at ~60fps.<p>The original C code was made by remis-thoughts and the full explanation is in his blog (http://remis-thoughts.blogspot.pt/2012/01/triple-buffering-as-concurrency_30.html).
I encourage anyone interested in reading it for a further understanding of the original implementation.<p>My implementation can be found here (https://github.com/p4checo/triplebuffer-sync).<p>The basic idea is to have an array with 3 positions (buffers) and an atomic flag that is compare-and-swapped to define which array elements correspond to what state, at any given time.
This way, only one atomic variable is used to model all 3 indexes of the array and the logic behind the triple buffering.
The buffer's 3 positions are named Dirty, Clean and Snap. The producer always writes to the Dirty index, and can flip the writer to swap the Dirty with the current Clean index.
The writer can request a new Snap, which swaps the current Snap index with the Clean index to get the most recent buffer. The consumer always reads the buffer in the Snap position.<p>I am using Release-Consume memory orderings for the Store/Load respectively, and would like to get some feedback from the community too see if I am doing it correctly for this specific problem.<p>For more detail please visit (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15204578/c11-atomic-memory-ordering-is-this-a-correct-usage-of-relaxed-release-consu).<p>Thanks,<p>Andr",1362415550

If we decide that we don't really need to educate people that way anymore, then the University of California system should be much smaller (if it still exists at all), and those researchers are going to have to find somewhere else to research, or leave research and do something else.<p>If that happened, California could take the money they aren't spending on the UC system anymore, and decide just to fund research directly, setting up a state research institution that <i>isn't</i> a university.

By using MOOCs they don't have to have as many students in class, they can schedule alot more classes to cover more students who say have a day job, and they can get away with hiring less people. The publicity is excellent because it is a good way to get self motivated people interested in the school. Notice that very rarely are entire academic programs put online. This is nothing but good for the university who sees decreased cost and increased student quality (potentially) and increased interest in the school.

I first discovered the Uberman schedule, which requires you to take on extreme sleep deprivation in order to compress your normally 90 minute sleep cycle into 20 minutes, and then only take 6 20 minute naps throughout the day.<p>This is the extreme case, and I'm still not convinced that can be healthy, but the less extreme options seem to have some long-term merit.  My friend has successfully adapted to sleeping 3 hours at night and taking 3 20 minutes naps during the day, and he says he loves all of the extra time during the night.  And apparently biphasic sleep is the norm in some countries.  <a href=""http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/</a> has some interesting articles about different schedules.",1362414821

That being said I don't see them replacing academia until three big problems are solved.<p>The first is the value added problem, at the end of the day they aren't better than normal lectures and are actually a bit worse. It's funny that even the most innovate institutions have accomplished little more than putting lectures up online. Lectures are about on level with books when it comes to retention. A much better model would be adopting something more like code academy with a good balance of interactivity and theory.<p>The second and probably most important problem is the depth problem. You don't go to college to take general ed requirements. You go to take the high level sophisticated classes in your field. These classes are rarely delivered in the form  of a lecture and often have extensive lab courses and student teacher interaction. I've yet to see a MOOC that can replace this effectively. Similarly, there is no good model for students to come in and pick up lab classes or lab materials. I'm sure there is a volunteer system that could do it, but it doesn't exist yet.<p>The final problem is of course credentialing. While many classes provide you with a certificate at the end the value of this is really up in the air. For most people, a certificate is unnecessary, the value is in the material, but if they plan to replace colleges they need to solve this problem.<p>I think MOOCs are the future.

But that doesn't mean we throw out traditional schooling""<p>Traditional schooling is the <i>cause</i> of the problems people have in school.  Keeping it, but making special exceptions for people who are bright but failing, is like having a tow truck drag your car to work in the morning because you did not want to take it to a mechanic.<p>In an American school, the goal is to have all the students think the same way.  We have laws that reinforce that goal at all levels of government.  All students learn basic algebra and basic trigonometry.  Very few learn Euclidean geometry, and almost none learn non-Euclidean geometry.  A math teacher is not in any way free to decide their curriculum; the curriculum is given to the teacher, who forces it upon the students.  A standardized test is given to all students at the end of the year, and it always has the same format, same subjects, and similar questions.<p>That is not a system meant to educate people or to promote their ability to think; it is a system meant to train people to be like everyone else.  It is not just that we settled on that because we lacked alternatives.  We chose this approach because the people in power did not consider teaching the population how to think to be a priority.  If they had considered it to be a priority, standardized testing would have been rejected early on, if it had even been thought of in the first place.<p>""you have to test kids, otherwise you can't know if they're actually learning anything""<p>Giving <i>everyone</i> the <i>exact same test</i>, or variants of the same test with all questions being asked in the same way, does nothing to test their academic progress.  Anyone can be trained to take a test when the format, subject matter, questions, etc. are all known in advance.<p>If you want to test people in a meaningful way, you need to give them problems they never encountered before, in formats they never encountered before.  Otherwise you are just as likely to identify well-educated students as well-trained students, and you will lack any way to measure the difference.<p>""Taking literature in college when you're in a CS program is more than dumb""<p>Only if you think the purpose of college is vocational training.  The idea that people go to college to receive job training and job credentials has been extremely destructive to higher education.  It is not just that humanities departments are being slashed; in the CS department at my alma mater, computability and algorithms were the only theoretical courses.  Compilers had been offered a few years before I arrived, complexity theory was not taught at all, and programming languages was just about different language features without any discussion of type theory.  When I asked the department chair why the curriculum was so easy, the answer was that only a handful of CS students actually enjoyed learning CS, and that the department could not afford to have the other students leave as a result of rigorous standards.  Those ""other students"" were only there for job credentials.<p>If you want vocation training, get a two year associates degree.  That will save you time and money, and you will not be part of the wave of destruction that is ruining higher education.",1362413781

Most of what they're targeting is replacing bachelor-level education, for one thing, not PhD-level. But more importantly, research is currently more constrained by funding and positions than availability of researchers. When either a university or Microsoft Research opens a position, they get hundreds of applicants. Even for postdoc jobs there are many more researchers than jobs. If several physics departments have to close, thousands of new students who've successfully taken physics MOOCs isn't going to make up for the closure of those research labs, from the perspective of progress in physics.<p>It's possible something else could replace those physics labs. Maybe Microsoft Research and similar non-academic labs will get larger, and expand out of computer science, more like the old Bell Labs? The U.S. could decide, alternately, that funding research is a priority, but doing it via hybrid educational/research institutions (the classic ""research university"") isn't going to work anymore, and choose to fund research-only institutions, e.g. bring the national labs back to the forefront.

I don't know how common this is for Coursera classes, but it left me with the impression that they might not need to be ""classes"" at all: just make educational television programs (or YouTube videos, or DVDs, or whatever).<p>This spring I am participating in the MIT Media Lab class on Learning Creative Learning, which is running online in parallel with an on-campus class. Between the combination of live videos from campus, readings, relevant online discussions, and assigned activities that we share with others in the class, to me, this class feels much more vibrant and engaging than my Coursera experience.<p>If future of MOOCs is more like this Media Lab class, then I'm looking forward to it. If it's more like Coursera, then I'd just as soon read a book in many cases.<p>But do either of these topple the existing world of academia? Coursera, sadly, might be a fine replacement for huge standard classes in which students are lectured at, and a Media Lab-style class could probably be a good replacement for many other classes.<p>I think though that the students need to take the classes more seriously for it to really work out. It seems to me that students are more likely to make a reasonable attempt at learning if they are paying tuition and risking getting bad grades on their record at a physical school than they are in a free online class which offers no particular negative response if they just totally blow it off.

Philosophy isn't about reality-testing, that's reserved to science, and it's why science is a branch of knowledge separate from philosophy.

You're thinking of a positive proof that a proposition is false. Let's say I claim there is a largest prime number.

To understand the difference, read this:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot</a><p>A quote: ""Russell's teapot, sometimes called the celestial teapot or cosmic teapot, is an analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (18721970) to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. Russell wrote that if he claims that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the grounds that they cannot prove him wrong.

Separating plungers and cars means you accelerate/decelerate much less mass, and have far fewer heat issues to deal with. The plungers themselves will get too hot for humans, but that's OK because humans are insulated from them.</i><p>You only have heat issues because you're trying to push a big column of air for no reason.  What is the value of this column of air?  The air itself is just creating friction.  The passengers can't breath it, because it's too hot for them to survive, and it's not enough to sustain life in the event of a failure, because most of this hypothetical tunnel is a vacuum.<p>> <i>And I already said how to deal with the heat in the cars.</i><p>You proposed adding enough cold thermal mass to offset the heat they'd absorb (literally a block of ice).  You're just adding a bunch of extra mass that you have to accelerate, and a bunch of mass you need to re-cool after every trip.<p>> <i>If the flaps work as proposed, the air pressure directly in front of the plunger will significantly exceed the air pressure in the rest of the tunnel. The cars sit in a bubble of air maintained by that shockwave. I have not tried to do fluid dynamics calculations to estimate friction, but it is going to be many times less than with Jacques' idea. I can believe it could be low enough to make this system work.</i><p>If the flaps work as proposed, then you have all the problems of an evacuated tunnel and most of the problems of Mattheij's idea, as I said.  You have an inhospitable environment, need to deal with the pressure differential (throughout most of the tunnel at least), tons of energy lost to friction (or else it wouldn't be too hot for humans), etc.  Even if your idea was technically possible, it seems to have no advantages over an evacuated tunnel except that you can say that it's not an evacuated tunnel.<p>> <i>I suspect that Elon plans to avoid right of way issues by building it in the ocean. If he doesn't do that, then it is very difficult to see how he can do anything like a ground based Concorde (his words) and still avoid right of way issues.</i><p>If you build far enough underwater to avoid right of way issues (aka, no boats can get past), you're looking at worse engineering issues than an evacuated tunnel anyway.  At just 10m below the surface, you're already at 2 atmospheres of pressure.<p>I'm also not sure that ""underwater"" counts as ""ground based"".",1353538125

My argument is that those saying this is useless appear to be going against evidence that it has - whilst limited - genuine utility.<p>Congratulations, you have imagined an instance where the this device can be used.  The constraints you have imposed are: that the land comprising the minefield <i>must</i> be used and <i>will</i> be used regardless of whether the mines are cleared; that there is no predetermined upper bound of what constitutes acceptable civilian casualties; that the cost of subsequent de-mining is immaterial (e.g., when the local population decides that maybe 50% wasn't good enough after all); that the terrain is suitably flat for the Kafon; and that the extant vegetation will not interfere with it.<p>Now, does the scenario you imagined <i>actually</i> exist in the real world?  Or is this purely an exercise in mental masturbation?  I would suggest that the scenario you imagine is not one that is common in the real world.  Afghanistan is not the first place where mines have been used, and yet there don't seem to be many farmers in Vietnam or Cambodia re-purposing known, uncleared minefields.  Almost all civilian mine casualties seem to be the result of people using areas where <i>they thought there were no mines.</i>  My take-away from _djo_'s comments is that the Mine Kafon primary effect will be to make it very cheap and very easy to create large areas where people <i>believe</i> there are ""no"" mines, and that is a problem.<p>In engineering it is often true that a general solution is preferred to one which only works in special cases.  The Mine Kafon seems to be, when viewed in the most charitable light, a very special-purpose solution which adds no value above the general solution.  Viewed in a more balanced way, the Mine Kafon is a solution in search of a problem[1].  User _djo_ seems to be saying  that, there are <i>already</i> tools which do what the Mine Kafon does, and they minimize not just the economic cost to the de-mining organization but also the human cost to the local population.<p>[1] Do you recall the article several days ago by Paul Graham about how to find good start-up ideas?  One thing I took away from that discussion is that you should try to find solutions to existing problems instead of looking for problems that fit your existing solution.",1353535202

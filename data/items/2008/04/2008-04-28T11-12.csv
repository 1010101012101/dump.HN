I think we're way past the point of ""web 2.0""-y names being memorable (though some will still make it out of obfuscation).<p>Take a word or two that work well with your idea.

175553,comment,175282,175282,0,0,Dylanfm,,,"I found the book ""DOM Scripting"" great. There's a brief intro to javascript syntax, then alot of focus on using javascript with the DOM and making sure you do it according to some best practices. The book finishes with an intro to ajax and is followed by a book called ""Bulletproof AJAX"" by the same bloke.
The gracefully degrading and unobtrusive use of javascript is important, and the author of these books preaches it well.",1209383909

175550,comment,175386,175386,0,0,vikram,,,"I had a look at django recently. Last week actually. My advise would be to start coding. Make sure the thing is installed right and that you can talk to your database of choice and that your examples run.<p>Then start coding. It's not too difficult. Some of the things with template engine are a bit funny, so try and not write any big code here, move it to the view/model. But otherwise remember that google is your friend.<p>My app is a geo based app, but I couldn't get geodjango to play nice. So I just installed the libs and went with that.",1209383802

175544,comment,175475,175529,0,0,swombat,,,"Speaking as someone who's not especially keen on religions (particularly christianity), I found that as I read the article, I kept stumbling out of reasonably interesting statements about your job and your experience of it, into bible quotes or other declarations of sin. It was fairly hard to parse out the actually interesting bits.<p>Another way that this jarred was that the software development and the christian points you were making were mostly unrelated. If you really want to write a blog about ""christian software development"", then you could focus on the relationships between your chosen religion and software development, and draw parallels between the two. This is different from just intermingling the two. If you actually drew out the parallels (e.g. ""Why I enjoyed this job more because I'm a Christian""), I might disagree with you but I wouldn't feel like the article keeps jumping from foot to foot.<p>Also, the ""I'm a sinner unworthy of God"" theme is practically a clich√©, so even from the perspective of an article about christianity, the article didn't really add much new.<p>Hope this helps.<p>Daniel",1209382258

- the webapp Amigo -- <a href=""https://myaccount.heyamigo.net/serviceDown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccount.heyamigo.net/serviceDown.html</a> -- that he even marketed starting a blog about its build and there was even a quote of O'Reilly talking about an untaped market.. and it's gone
- a few years back Ryan also built a subscription based online project manager, before 37Signals launched their Basecamp, and it's no longer around.<p>Bottom line: he says you can do it to, and he's right, but you have to really know your target market at the start (which he did with targeting Dropsend to the designer/agency market, that he knew well due to his work on BD4D) and have contacts in it to spread the word (at the start, eventually your client demographic expands)... but it isn't as easy as he makes it seem on a blog post based on one of his successes, when that formula didn't work out well for his other projects.",1209381072

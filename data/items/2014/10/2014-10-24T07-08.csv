</code></pre>
and assuming c, d are both constant (i.e. assume they are your long-run average of calories consumed and exercise done) you can solve to get<p><pre><code>  w[t] = c / (alpha + beta * d) + const * (phi ** t)
</code></pre>
where phi is a number smaller than 1, and const is some constant that depends on your initial weight. Over time, the phi <i></i> t term decays away, and you are left with your long-term stable weight,<p><pre><code>  w = c / (alpha + beta * d)
</code></pre>
Using c = 2000, alpha = 12.5, beta = 0.63 and d = 0 you get a long-run stable weight of<p><pre><code>  w = 2000 / 12.5 = 160 lb
</code></pre>
On the other hand, if you eat 2500 calories per day but run five miles, you get<p><pre><code>  w = 2500 / (12.5 + 0.63 * 5) = 160 lb

so if you want to eat an extra 500 calories per day, you should run 5 miles per day.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see how accurate this is.",1414137218

IMHO, there&#x27;s a lot of puffery and bullshit going on at these NGO conferences and meetings, where self-important people present platitudes in powerpoint slides about vacuous and abstract solutions for the world&#x27;s problems. It&#x27;s the same nonsense we&#x27;ve seen before. A bunch of bankers go to meet in secret, and all of a sudden people are talking about Bilderbergers/Trilateral Commission/Illuminati/FreeMasons secretly ruling the international scene.<p>If a bunch of Silicon Valley guys go to Davos and meet with say, the government of Burma, where they talk about how some technical internet thing is going to help their country, is it nefarious, or is it a naive belief by people passionate about technology and their own ability, that they can solve complex problems with stuff they&#x27;re working on? (The State Department arranges lots of these &quot;CEO tours&quot; all the time. Are they secretly working on foreign policy, or, are they trying to open up exports, or sell people on American capitalism? And so what if the CEOs are talking about the benefits of the Web or internet technology for an open society? Just because the trip is arranged on behalf of the State Department doesn&#x27;t make the agenda <i>wrong</i>)<p>The desire for the ultra-successful techies to thinkt hey can solve the world&#x27;s problems by exporting Silicon Valley is the kind of thinking Mike Judge lampoons in &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, the naivete&#x27; of techies that they can &quot;change the world&quot; by developing an app or distributing computers to people in a country with broken civil institutions.<p>Assange wants to play &quot;connect the dots&quot; to imply something nefarious going on, but if Angelina Jolie were in the same meetings instead of Eric Schmidt, what would Assange be saying? Hollywood actors often have the same narcissistic view.<p>Nothing in his commentary actually zeros in on anything Google has done based on these supposed connections that&#x27;s bad (leaving aside the wrong claims about how PRISM works)<p>What would be the incentive for Google to risk a tens of billion-a-quarter business on some quid-pro-quo for the US Government or Eric Schmidt&#x27;s vanity? After all, it is a public company seeking to make a profit. It is not an oil company, it does not harvest raw resources from foreign companies, and it doesn&#x27;t make hardly any revenue from selling services to the US government. There&#x27;s not much US government favors can do for it&#x27;s bottom line. It&#x27;s biggest impediments are regulations that block people from using its services (mainly China). It doesn&#x27;t have the same incentives that past American companies needed the American empire for -- to protect its <i>physical</i> interests in oil or resource concessions abroad. You need the US empire for that, you don&#x27;t necessarily need it to protect <i>virtual assets</i>.<p>A plausible theory for Google being in bed with the US Government in this regard would have to provide a compelling motive. You can make the case for Exxon, or Unilever, Halliburton, or say, companies with manufacturing plants abroad, that rely on US government protection and contracts, but the only theory about why Google would even want to be in bed with the US government would rest on some kind of threat, like the government putting a regulatory gun to the head of Google threatening onerous restrictions or anti-trust action that would destroy their business unless they comply -- a huge stick, not a carrot.<p>My point is, Google has more important things to worry about on a day to day basis. They&#x27;re more worried about competitors like Apple, than some weak ass benefits some association with bureaucrats might provide.<p>I think Schmidt&#x27;s post-Google-CEO career, from writing books, to trying to be a pseudo-diplomat and tech-utopian ambassador are really harming Google&#x27;s brand by association. Bill Gates had the right idea, pick low hanging, high value, fruit, work on the boring stuff, stay mostly quiet about it while you get stuff done. Actions speak louder than words.<p>But I think it&#x27;s just that -- association. Google Ideas isn&#x27;t Google, this Cohen guy is irrelevent to Google&#x27;s main business lines.",1414136426

8502462,comment,8501455,8501455,0,0,beloch,,,"&quot;I learned that it is really hard to accurately measure calories consumed, even if you are trying.  &quot;<p>I&#x27;d just like to highlight this, because it is profoundly true. There are probably very few people who have the patience to log everything they eat, diet or no diet, unless they have some kind of payoff close at hand! Even if you do log everything you eat, it&#x27;s still not easy.  Here are just a few reasons why:<p>1. The best foods to eat on a diet don&#x27;t come in prepackaged portions with the calorie count labelled on the back.<p>2. Packaged food often does not have anywhere near the same calories as the label claims. Food manufacturers often aren&#x27;t very precise and they have an incentive to underestimate.<p>3. The ideal way to measure the absorbable caloric content of food would be to feed it (and nothing else) to human test-subjects (other animals can metabolize foods quite differently; e.g. grass and cows) for an extended period of time while strictly regulating the test-subjects&#x27; physical activity. Measure the weight change, and there you have it. Yeah... This experiment is never going to happen.  That&#x27;s why we stick food in a calorimeter, burn it, and consider the heat it provides to be a measure of its caloric content.  This crude method provides decent estimates on average, but can occasionally be misleading.<p>For these reasons, I&#x27;m actually a bit surprised that the author&#x27;s data matches the theory so closely. This indicates the author scrupulously measured his portion sizes, found accurate estimates for the caloric content of the foods he ate, and logged <i>everything</i>. This is seriously impressive.  If the author had failed to log something as insignificant as the sugar and cream he puts in his coffee it would have thrown his numbers way off over a period of 75 days. Similarly, he must have scrupulously recorded his physical activities.  The fit is so perfect I actually suspect he... ah...  <i>played</i> with his data slightly after the fact.  A &quot;fortuitous&quot; choice for alpha is obviously helpful too.<p>One other thing worth pointing out is that weighing yourself daily and plotting it on a graph like this is a <i>fantastic</i> way to observe progress and stay motivated to stick to your new routine. First, if you don&#x27;t regularly observe your weight then you have no feedback.  If you fail to accurately measure your caloric intake/expenditure the results might not be as desired.  Feedback is necessary. However, daily feedback can be wildly misleading if you don&#x27;t place it in context. If you look at the author&#x27;s data, there are plenty of ups and downs around the trend. For example, on day 7 he observed a large gain and on day 8 a large loss. If the author only kept the previous day&#x27;s weight in his head he might conclude that he did poorly on day 6 and made up for it on day 7. In reality, he might have consumed very healthy, fiber-rich food (e.g. a lot of beans) on day 6 and a bunch of sugar-rich processed garbage on day 7.  The author might have stored away some fat on day 7 but wound up weighing less on day 8 purely because of passing the fiber from his meal on day 6.  Pure sugar doesn&#x27;t leave much behind to be passed!<p>I do question the worth of calculating your caloric deficit. It&#x27;s simply too hard to get an accurate measure of consumption.  However, measuring your weight regularly and plotting it so you can observe the larger trend is <i>invaluable</i>.  About five years ago I dropped 60 pounds (it&#x27;s still off, and I&#x27;ve gained lean muscle mass).  I didn&#x27;t count calories.  I simply measured my weight regularly and plotted it on a graph similar to the author.  I looked at the larger trend and made small adjustments gradually to keep it going in the right direction. If you don&#x27;t weigh yourself regularly you can undo months worth of progress with one new bad habit.  If you don&#x27;t place your weight in context you&#x27;ll have difficulty identifying habits that are a problem. Finally, watching that line steadily come down is a fantastic way to stay motivated.",1414134678

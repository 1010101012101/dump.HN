3665211,comment,3658294,3658590,1,0,victork2,,,"hmm I have been downvoted but I deserve it. So to rephrase what I do the problem is a you say not losing data that is going to be inserted but performing operations with the wrong type of data which mean errors.<p>Let's say I have 3 pieces of data required by a function to compute the outcome of a certain operation (withdraw 10 billion dollars): A B C. We change the data in that fashion:
A -> A'
B -> B' 
C -> C' -> C""<p>When I query, because of eventual consistency the f(A,B,C) may very well be:<p>f(A,B,C), f(A,B',C), f(A,B,C'), f(A,B,C""), ... so on. It is simple when you have 3 sources, but when you have 50, and then when the operation use 50 or those f, depending on 50 other pieces of data ?<p>Anyway, again sorry for my poor explanation of the issue!",1330916320

About a year ago I discovered that they didn't protect attachments to tickets in private repositories (since fixed).  Anyone who could guess the URL could access the content.  (It looked like the cause was keeping the attachments in S3 without front-ending them.)<p>On contacting them I was told it would be fixed in a day or two, and that it was no big deal since you had to guess the URL.  The values you had to guess in the URL were a ticket number (they start from 1), a repository name, a date (YMD) and a filename.  Sure there is some variety in there but it is not in the billions of possibilities, just hundreds and that won't make any computer break into a sweat and in my words at the time ""easy"".  To make matters worse you can't delete the attachments to tickets.<p>This may not affect you.  It certainly affected me.  For example we had some keyfiles in one ticket.  Coredumps in others.<p>Two weeks later the issue still hadn't been fixed and I don't know when it was.  I've never seen disclosure of the issue.  There wasn't even any way of knowing if attachments had been accessed in an unauthorized way since there was no checking in the first place.",1330916052

[RESPONSES at this point vary too widely to standardize.] I'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the dialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige, and anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender who wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able to use SWE. This is just How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad about it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and unfair and decide right here and now to spend every waking minute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you should, but I'll tell you something - if you ever want those arguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're going to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is the dialect our nation uses to talk to itself...

A block is done to ""prevent damage or disruption"". That might be short term or indefinitely, but not permanently. You put in a block when there's an issue. But a ban is a formal statement that you are no longer allowed in. You only do that after some thought and consultation.<p>Github is actually pretty similar given that the commercial side of Github is fuelled by the free, open-source side. There is a feeling of community ownership. Going straight for the ban without some thought and soul-searching is confusing fixing an issue with making a more detailed judgment about whether the user ought to be on the site at all.<p>IMHO, Github played it about right.",1330915257

3665077,comment,3664581,3664581,9,0,rdl,,,"I wonder if they pay their security firms for code audits, vs. just system configuration level stuff.  It's reasonable to think they're about as expert on their codebase and its security as anyone else would be, so just having different people within the same company look at it would probably be effective, and could be done more frequently than an external audit.  (I generally advise AGAINST external code audit for a lot of early stage companies, since it can be a lot of wasted money when the codebase is changing; it's better to have some guiding principles internally and then try to reduce the scope of security critical code as much as possible, and eventually audit that.  Stick to securing the infrastructure, which is pretty standard across companies and thus cheap, and can be handled through outsourcing to gmail/heroku/etc., at least in the beginning.)<p>Looks like they have two companies for audit/pentest (nGenuity and Matasano Security), plus a consultant.

3665067,comment,3663746,3664062,49,0,gradstudent,,,"The (movie/audio/warez/demo) ""scene"" is not anarchic at all but rather a very well organised distributed processing machine. You probably know these guys organise into ""groups"" but there is lots of other stuff you likely do not know. I will describe below aspects of the warez scene, as it was some 10 years ago. I believe most observations continue to hold today and are probably mirrored in the movie-release scene. So:<p>""The scene"" is made up of groups and each group is made up of specialists: suppliers provide material for release, crackers (or rippers, depending on context) remove copy protection and sometimes optional ""filler"" material, coders write useful helper software for the group and couriers distribute releases around the internet. Not all groups fill every role and some may have other roles I did not describe here (hackers, carders, hardware suppliers to name a few). There are sometimes partnerships between groups with different specialities; usually this occurs when there is an overlap in membership. For example: a release group may have close links with a particular courier group and those guys handle all their releases.<p>The distribution process is actually quite interesting. Each successful release group aims to have a small list of affiliations with well known and prestigious underground boards/ftp-sites. The quality and prestige of a board depends on the speed of its connection, its capacity, its group affiliations, the standing of its admins in the community and the speed with which new releases are uploaded to it. Each well regarded site is allowed <i>only one</i> particular kind of affiliation: a games group affil, an apps group affil, a courier affil, an ISO affil -- you get the idea. The important thing is that there is only one of each. Affiliations carry prestige for a site and being affiliated with the best sites raises a group's prestige, so there is often heated competition between sites and groups for affils. This is the case at least in the so called ""zero second"" scene  where releases are ""traded"" (i.e. re-uploaded) by couriers within seconds of being first uploaded. Once a release has been traded among all zero-second sites, they slowly filter down to lesser and lesser sites until eventually making their way to the Internet at large.<p>So why would you go this all this trouble? The reasons are myriad but usually it comes down to prestige: for example, among couriers there is a longstanding weekly and monthly competition between groups that prove their chops by trying to dominate each other. Similar competitions exist among release groups. There is huge pressure to be the first to release a highly anticipated game or well known application. Additionally, there are strict rules about how to release something -- what to keep, what can (and should) be omitted, how to package everything up, the inclusion of .nfo and .diz files and so on. Failure to comply with these strict standards renders a release invalid and causes it to be ""nuked"" (deleted) among the top sites. This process amounts to a public shaming of the group responsible and makes it possible for competing groups to snatch the credit by doing a ""proper"" release.<p>I could go on and on but I think that's enough for now. Hopefully I've convinced you that pirates aren't an anarchic bunch ;)",1330913149

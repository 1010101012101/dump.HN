1894595,comment,1894350,1894545,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"There's a great book about all of this, ""Against Intellectual Monopoly."" [1]<p>There's an interesting bit about the English/American writer thing you mention, specifically Dickens. From chapter two:<p><pre><code>    The amount of revenues British authors received up front 
    from American publishers often exceeded the amount they 
    were able to collect over a number of years from 
    royalties in the UK. Notice that, at the time, the US 
    market was comparable in size to the UK market.

    More broadly, the lack of copyright protection, which 
    permitted the United States publishers’ “pirating” of 
    English writers, was a good economic policy of great 
    social value for the people of United States, and of no 
    detriment, as the Commission report and other evidence 
    confirm, for English authors. Not only did it enable the 
    establishment and rapid growth of a large and successful 
    publishing business in the United States; also, and more 
    importantly, it increased literacy and benefited the 
    cultural development of the American people by flooding 
    the market with cheap copies of great books. As an 
    example: Dickens’ A Christmas Carol sold for six cents 
    in the US, while it was priced at roughly two dollars 
    and fifty cents in England. This dramatic increase in 
    literacy was probably instrumental for the emergence of 
    a great number of United States writers and scientists 
    toward the end of the nineteenth century.

Arguments about intellectual property now seem to always focus on the ability of the author to make money, and not about the basic reason that the concept of IP was created: it was a gift from society to creators to both help them and encourage the enrichment of society at large. The dramatic rise in UGC demonstrates that 'creators gonna create' anyway, so the deal makes less and less sense for society to keep up.<p>There's also a part in the book about the steam engine stuff, too, but this is already getting long...<p>1: <a href=""http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.h...</a>",1289498131

1894585,comment,1894344,1894464,0,0,randomwalker,,,"First of all this has no relevance if you're not a complexity theorist. No ""practical"" impact, not even remotely. A real downer, I know, but I thought that had to be stated up front.<p>The question is why are complexity theorists excited about this.<p>When a problem is too hard to solve, you look for easier versions to solve first. Here the easier version is to prove that the complexity class NEXP (which is intuitively vastly more powerful than even NP) is bigger than a certain class of circuits of constant depth (circuits with polynomial depth are known to be roughly equivalent to P, and constant-depth circuits are intuitively vastly <i>less</i> powerful).<p>ETA: the circuits considered here are ""non-uniform,"" which makes the previous paragraph slightly inaccurate. Nevertheless, the point stands that the goal here is to separate two complexity classes that are intuitively very different in their power.<p>Circuit lower bounds -- proving that a restricted class of circuits, as above, is in fact limited in its computational power -- have been notorious for their hardness. The reason one would want to prove this kind of statement is not because these circuits are objects of practical interest, but because of the <i>proof techniques</i> that would come out as a side-effect, in the hope that these techniques would be applicable in solving other, harder problems.<p>So that's the gist of it: the 3 reasons this theorem is exciting are: proof techniques, proof techniques and proof techniques.<p>Now some of the statements from the post should hopefully make a lot more sense:<p><i>This approach converts weak algorithms for solving circuit satisfiability questions into circuit lower bounds. Ryan's proof doesn't use deep mathematical techniques but rather puts together a series of known tools in amazingly clever ways.</i><p><i>Ryan breaks through the natural proofs barrier in an interesting way. ... he avoids the issue by using diagonalization and so his proof does not fulfill the constructivity requirement of natural proofs.</i><p>What's going on here is that there are often meta-proofs in complexity theory showing that a certain approach to proofs won't work. The ""natural proofs barrier"" being referred to is (apparently) a limit on what you can achieve by a certain type of ""natural"" construction that is explained in this post by Lipton: <a href=""http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natu...</a><p>The one thing I haven't touched upon is why there are ""mod m"" gates in the circuit class under consideration. That is also (surprise, surprise) related to proof techniques. As Luca Trevisan explains, using mod m gates instead of binary gates or mod-prime gates disables two well-known classes of proofs (""fixing variables to random values"" and ""low-degree polynomial approximation""), ensuring that some heavy artillery will need to be developed in order to prove statements about them. <a href=""http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/a-circuit-lower-bound-breakthrough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/a-circuit-lower...</a>",1289497995

Otherwise you'd have fragmentation where the user doesn't have the proper interpreter installed, and a never ending stream of ""language downloads"" which might be cool to devs but horribly impractical for end users.<p>Because we're not writing in the browser anymore, we'd be back to offline compilation and static code generation. I suppose it'd be possible to JIT the bytecode (assuming that current Javascript optimizers work on the IR; I don't know enough to qualify this any further). From my casual browsing of LtU, it seems that tracing JITs in particular may offer optimizations dificult to achieve with static bytecode compilation, particularly in identifying hot spots. But the more I think of it, that's a non-issue because you're still compiling to bytecode and JITing from there.<p>This feels very Java-ish to me.

An IL where a member field access may involve looking up a string in a hash table instead of being a single machine instruction? Propose that as an IL to a compiler guy and they'll laugh at you. Javascript is an historical accident. Let's look at some alternatives if history was different:<p>- Scheme: this would have been a much better choice, because it supports integers and has a compact object representation instead of representing everything with hash tables. Bad point: all objects are boxed (like in JS). Good point: tail calls are handy when compiling all kinds of control structures.<p>- Java: As an IL to compile down to this would have been better than Javascript. Good points on top of Scheme: unboxed primitive types, static typing means fewer runtime checks. Bad point: lack of tail calls.<p>- ML: excellent choice: has both unboxed primitives and tail calls.<p>I challenge you to find a language that would have been a worse choice than Javascript. It may turn out that by working really hard on smart runtimes and compilers you can get OKish performance out of Javascript in some cases, but that doesn't mean that it's a good choice for an intermediate language. A ML compiler that just translates to LLVM IL as simply as possible without doing any optimizations itself will easily beat the highly optimized Javascript engines we have today.",1289495314

1894406,comment,1893660,1894141,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"Yeah, in my experience, most biostatisticians (especially those involved in public health and clinical research) are SAS folks. Some of that is inertia- a lot of these people learned SAS at the same time they were learning stats. However, I think that most of SAS's continuing prevalence is due to the fact that, for all of its (many, many, many) problems, SAS is a freakin' log chipper when it comes to statistics- it doesn't care how much data you throw at it, or what kinds of crazy and/or exotic statistics you ask it for- if you can decipher its syntax, you can get it to do it.<p>Even for stuff that a lot of other programs can do just fine, SAS often has an edge. For example, everybody and their brother can do a logistic regression model... but SAS can give you confidence intervals for all kinds of crazy parts of the model that SPSS won't even bother calculating and that R will only give you point estimates for.<p>The other great thing about SAS is that a lot of the good statistics books from the last twenty or thirty years include SAS sample code- for example, I'm currently having to do some off-the-beaten-path ANOVA stuff, and the reference I'm using (Edwards' ""Analysis of Variance for the Behavioral Sciences"") uses SAS as its language of choice.<p>That said, I personally find the SAS ""language"" to be alternatively bewildering and nostalgia-inducing (the ""cards"" command, anybody?). SAS is the only language about which I can honestly say ""it makes R's syntax look clean and predictable"". Also, the Windows version of SAS is an absolute abomination from a UI standpoint. And, their licensing schemes are draconian, and installing the damn thing can easily take an entire day, especially if (say, for example) the installer gets confused because you've already got a JDK installed on your computer. Not that I'm bitter, or anything...<p>Of course, as others have noted, in bioinformatics, R either is already the default or is almost there. I know that in my department's bioinformatics courses, they use R, Python, and Perl almost exclusively, and only break out the SAS when there's something specific they need it to do.",1289495313

1894401,comment,1894015,1894015,0,0,jherdman,,,"I had a really good conversation yesterday at the Dev Lunch in Toronto about so-called Smart TVs. Here's a quick summary:<p>* TVs are about media consumption, not about interaction in the PC-sense of the word.<p>* When one wants extra content or information regarding the media they are consuming, they tend to use a secondary device (e.g. iPad, notebook)<p>* Most devs in the room merely wanted a device that would allow them to better manage and consume the media they wanted<p>* It's not clear what sort of apps (besides the aforementioned management tool) would be beneficial to write for a Smart TV platform. This is likely a function of not groking what a future with a Smart TV might be like.<p>* Over and over again, it was noted that the TV is a social device. You watch it with friends, be it in a bar, or a home. It's not clear that interacting with a Smart TV <i>could</i> be a social activity.<p>I'm interested to see what happens in this sphere, but I frankly can't shake the feeling that it's a dead end. Mostly dumb boxes that enable consumption, and management of media are probably the most likely thing to succeed, a la TiVo.",1289495243

Then I'd use keyboard shortcuts to move through the tabs and close the irrelevant ones.<p>Now, I've found that I can usually refine the search to a single good one using instant, by looking at the immediate feedback of the results being returned, and preview lets me quickly see which of the results are junk and which are actually salient before I even get as far as opening them in a tab.<p>They've made an operation that I do many times a day considerably faster and more interactive and reduced the cognitive load.  This is usability where it matters - bringing information closer to my mind so I can get things done quicker.<p>Most impressive to me is that these improvements seem make a more significant difference for the long tail of professional work, rather than the more trivial searches for new products or celebrity gossip etc.  I'm thankful to see Google choosing this as a priority.<p>I'm reminded of the famous Steve Jobs story about faster boot times saving lives: <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Saving_Lives.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a><p>Google's saving lives too.",1289495238

But Sun made it very difficult, building their complete bloated software stack from scratch.  They didn't <i>want</i> Java to cooperate with anything else, let alone make it embeddable into another piece of software.  They wrote their string handling code in an interpreted language rather than taint themselves with C!  As far as I can tell, Sun viewed Netscape - Java's only significant customer at the time - as a mere vector for their Windows replacement fantasies.  Anybody who actually tried to use Java would just have to suffer.<p>Meanwhile Brendan was doing the work of ten engineers and three customer support people, and paying attention to things that mattered to web authors, like mixing JS code into HTML, instant loading, integration with the rest of the browser, and working with other browser vendors to make JS an open standard.<p>So now JS is the x86 assembler of the web - not as pretty as it might be, but it gets the job done (GWT is the most hilarious case in point).  It would be a classic case of worse is better except that Java only looked better from the bottom up.  Meanwhile JS turned out to be pretty awesome.  Good luck trying to displace it.<p>SWF was the other interesting bytecode contender, but I don't know much about the history there.

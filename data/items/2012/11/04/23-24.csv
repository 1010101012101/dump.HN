They focus on shipping to the high end phones first -- those customers have paid more for that support. Some low end devices just never get to the top of the priority list.<p>If you want upgrades, buy the best phone you can. If you are buying low end, you have to realise that it's essentially locked to the version that it ships with.<p>That's my take on it anyway. I don't have any inside information.",1352073492

But I'm not saying that your comment isn't in earnest either - you're wishing to figure out how to categorically make spam look like not spam, as your startup is based on making it easy for people to spam their friends and associates, and so is highly vulnerable to the social repercussions of bad first impressions.<p>A simple and easy first step to making your site seem less spammy would be to register a whole bunch of different domains composed of relevant keywords. These can be used to mitigate being banned from link aggregator sites and to delay users noticing the pattern. Markov chain generated text surrounding the links would do wonders on the less savvy users, too. I'm sure there are plenty more of such tips if you hang out in the right forums.<p>What you fail to realize is that credibility has been destroyed by each and every detail of the situation. The earnest blog that has the occasional spammy referral post can be mostly forgiven (although the users that upvote it shouldn't be), as it's clear that the writer has a life purpose besides referral links. I see no such redeeming qualities here.<p>""Should know better"" refers to the fact that you present yourself as part of the tech community, while simultaneously disrespecting the general consensus on spam. Although maybe it's just that the shark that was jumped has died of old age.<p>Oh, I just remembered it's Sunday - I've got to go do a bit of sanitation hacking.",1352073416

In the spin, the interesting element is actually lost, because after introducing the topic, the journalist digs no deeper and gives the audience no greater insight than what they might derive from a better-written headline.<p>The fact that personalized search applies to political topics is unsurprising and probably reflects that Google is data-driven. The fact that Romney doesn't trigger the same personalization as Obama probably reflects that, until recently, his name was virtually never searched for (relatively).[1]<p>By introducing Mr. Weinberg, the author gives us hope that we will learn something about the nature of personalized search and its implications, but I think that HNers would be much more satisfied to re-read his blog entries on the topic.[2]<p>[1] = <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=obama%2C%20romney&geo=US&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=obama%2C%20romney&#38...</a><p>[2] = <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/08/how-do-you-completely-de-personalize-google-results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/08/how-do-you-compl...</a>",1352073392

Can you point me towards your sources?<p>You still have not responded to my question about balloons.  Do you feel they should receive a similar ban? By your logic it seems like they should. They seem to be, at the very least, somewhat dangerous for children (and certainly more dangerous than they appear).<p>I would never want to earn a living at the expense of children's lives.  We are not bad people.  But I honestly do not believe that Buckyballs are as dangerous as they are being made out to be.  In addition, I see no reason why a product such as Buckyballs should be uniformly banned when there are millions of responsible adults who enjoy them safely and appropriately.  There are no children in my household, and if a child is going to come visit, I make sure there is nothing around that could possibly harm them.  I would put alway bottles of liquor, cover power outlets, make sure there are no lighters on the coffee table, and ensure that no buckyballs are within reach.  I believe that responsible adults, with appropriate warnings and instructions, should be able to enjoy adult-only products within their home.  If I had a toddler running around I would absolutely not have buckyballs in my home.<p>There is no substitute for proper and attentive parenting.  All the bans in the world are not going to save a child who is left to roam around swallowing anything they come across.",1352073357

That's language-specific, and should not be regarded as a valid answer in a language-neutral test. But the point is, it seems to me that the author is trying to find holes in the test. Of course that ""hen"" is not the only possible answer. As the author suggested, meat of pigs, for example, is not kosher. We can find things that differentiate any one of those animals from the rest. In any set, you can find some property of any object that will differentiate it from the rest. But that's not the point, is it? The point is to find the most obvious answer. The same goes for sequences of numbers. Yes, you can continue a sequence of numbers with any number that you like, and your answer will be perfectly valid. But the point is to find the most obvious one.",1352073272

I don't see how it's the company's fault if there's a big label and yet the parents still ""don't bat an eye"" when their child swallows a magnet. I'm simply trying to point out the dichotomy and the uneven enforcement of regulation that is supposedly there to protect us.<p>Furthermore, as I stated in my previous comment, I believe the mere existence of the CPSC is a threat against my civil liberties. Thus, I also believe the ban against lawn darts was incorrect. The only reason you're probably hearing about it now is because we are now only having the opportunity to discuss it, not because they pushed back on a ""nerd toy""[1].<p>I understand what the CPSC is trying to do, and I'm not decrying the goal of trying to protect children.

You undermine your own argument with that comment.<p>If the CPSC is doing its job well it will react towards gadgets that are within its domain and statistically shown to be dangerous. Regardless of how you feel about this agency's actual mission, that is a good design to keep them from eventually trying to keep you from reading Mein Kampf or Lady Chatterley's Lover or something. (if you're in the United States you also benefit from the first amendment...)<p>> It doesn't take the harmful objects out of the market, so why set this precedent?<p>This also strikes me as a really myopic thing to say. Do you really think that eliminating an item from the toy store shelves and relegating it to scientific supply shops is not going to effectively remove it from kids grasp? The obvious counterexample is the chemistry sets of yesteryear.<p>(it's worse than that: those shops won't finish the magnets in the user-friendly way that these guys did. that was their innovation.)<p>> What makes this ruling more egregious than any other that comes to mind is that it seems to have been made selectively and without good reason.<p>Again, very disingenuous. Kids were getting hurt, it's not like the CPSC was making that up.

A huge amount of the residential development in northern VA is out in Fairfax County, and that area is just now getting a Metro line. Moreover, the metro stops in Vienna, Fairfax, etc, are god-awful. They're built in the middle of the woods so you have to drive to them. A sensible rail system needs to have high density development around the station.<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to say here?<p>The DC area systems are pretty young relative to the ones you're comparing it them to. The NY subway has been around since 1904. The DC Metro broke ground in 1969 and opened 1976. This is significantly different from systems like Metra or NJT which subsumed existing commercial tracks.<p>How densely populated will Fairfax be in 2084?<p>DC versus wherever else was never my point though. It's about people with cars who choose to brave some of the worst traffic in the country rather than driving the local Metro station and zipping on in.<p>Personally, driving all the way downtown takes about 1:15, taking the Metro is 12 minute drive to the station followed by a 35 minute train ride which I can spend reading to within a block of my workplace.<p>>Meanwhile, Metro North, LIRR, and NJT go pretty much anywhere people live in Westchester, Long Island, or NJ. And the train stations are all approachable on foot. I walk 4 minutes from a 40 story high-rise in Westchester to the train station. That's 4 minutes from getting on my elevator to being on the platform.<p>That's great. Plenty of people who ride the DC Metro have the same experience, there are 85 stations.<p>How many of those approachable train stations have 3500+ parking spaces or are served by 50+ buses?<p>Apples to oranges.<p>They're different systems serving different geography at different points in their development - any of which is surely better than driving.",1352072805

CSEs can make you money, but it doesn't take long to figure out all CSEs do is play a game of ""sell traffic to retailers for cheaper than they can buy it themselves."" After 12 months of CSEs, it was obvious that being a ""CSE expert"" wasn't a good career path for me.<p>Arguably, Nextag's four competitors are Google Shopping, Pricegrabber, Shopzilla, and Shopping.com. Google Shopping was free to list your products for the longest time (until earlier this year), which provided for a much better user experience. Between 2008 and 2010, Google Shopping's marketshare kept eating away at these other CSEs. It was clear their product was better on all fronts.<p>I think it should also be noted that in 2005, Shopzilla was acquired by Scripps for $525M. Scripps sold Shopzilla to a private equity company for $165M last year. Pricegrabber was bought in 2005 as well - $485M price tag. They just got dumped for ~$80M.<p>Most CSEs were founded in the 90s; you could argue that their models haven't changed since. It's not working anymore.

The same was true for the iPod, you simply can't explain the popularity of that device by citing only  the early adopters that first embraced the new device. Early adopters lead the curve and the rest follow, that the reason companies like Apple work so hard to court them.<p>effect of the fact that Apple had access to a mass of brainwashed fanbois that will buy anything with an Apple logo, which provided them with both the funding and the opportunity to target the deep-pocketed early-adopter market.<p><pre><code>   But in a world where Apple didn't exist, Samsung would have shipped the Galaxy family of products around the same time as they eventually did - and they would have looked just as they do, too. Any resemblance in design between Sammy's products and Apple's is due to convergent evolution: it is simply less efficient, if not thoroughly impossible, to make a smartphone or a tablet that doesn't feature that shape, that button, that grid of icons in those specific colors - or even one that doesn't ship in that type of box.\n</code></pre>\nBut this is simply not true, Samsung and LG were working on a variety of different devices, advanced devices with mobile TV for Asia and basic feature phones in a variety of designs, but primarily flipphones and Nokia-like candybars. The same is true of Motorola which was trying to retain the marketshare they were quickly losing with the Razr and Razr-like devices.\nI'm sure Samsung had something like the iPhone in development, running one of a variety of underpowered home grown OSs or maybe Symbian. I'm sure that they had something like the devices they had been building with Windows Mobile. I'm sure they were slowly getting to a device resembling in a number of superficial ways the iPhone. But they did not have an iPhone in development, a device with an OS designed to run fully native applications, a device embracing the ""real web."" We can see this in the devices that were out at the time of the iPhone being announced, the web browsers were these limited ""mobile web"" browsers designed for stuff like ""compact HTML"" but mostly running WAP sites.\nI will agree with you on the shape, and an Apple design patent claiming ownership of any rectanglular device with a screen is truely absurd. On the other hand, the Apple earpiece was a unique design element that was very quickly copied by almost every phone out there after the iPhone was shown to the world. I rember browsing Engadget and BGR in the months after and seeing just the tops of the product shots, almost all of them featured the Apple earpiece design, even in feature phones and flip phones.<p>The four icons below the screen is not as much of an innovation as Apple claims, and certainly not a unique look and feel element of the iPhone. The four main applications were represented by physical buttons on the Palm devices, located directly below the screen. (Apple made some subsitutions for the modern mobile device and to tie the iPhone back to the iPod.) The application grid was present on the Palm as well. (And arguably can trace it's history to Apple's own Newton, but that's irrelevent to it's status as prior art and commonly accepted design.) But you claim that these are the only possible choices as far as design and color? I can't see that. I would suggest that the iPhone followed the trend towards more colorful and thematic interfaces started by third-party software for the Palm OS and Windows Mobile devices and possibly Symbian.<p>As far as timing, the iPhone caught other manufactures unawares, pushed the CPU speed forward (indirectly, the original iPhone was using an outdated CPU but one on Samsung's roadmap meaning that Apple could move to the next version of that chip without a full redesign of the circuit layout), and pushed the carriers towards Android. While Motorola had already come out claming they were going to focus on Linux their actions did not match that statement. HTC was one of Microsoft's biggest OEMs before they took a chance with Android on the G1. LG had a prototype ""Prada"" device, the closest to the iPhone that had been publically shown, but it may have been rushed to coincide with the iPhone.",1352071835

It's over 10% of the federal budget if you include all of the programs that fall under ""welfare.""<p>Looking at the statistics, the amount of money spent on welfare didn't significantly increase or decrease during or after Bill Clinton was in office (until our current financial crisis.)

I changed the basis of the question to encompass the need to reassess driving style in the presence of a change in weather conditions, as opposed to choosing specific instances of danger. That is not a rephrasing as I originally contended. My apologies.<p>If all roads can be precarious, the answer is all of the above, thus solving the dilema of the test taker understanding the need to be more perceptive in colder weather. We cannot control for all variables that would make a road slick or dangerous, and therefore cannot test them all individually, but must group them together into a situation (ex: road conditions changed).\nIf we accept that driving in and of itself is an active activity, then we should not have to distinguish between specific changes in road conditions for any change in road conditions should be enough for the driver to reevaluate their driving.<p>This question on the test should then be changed completely to reflect the fact that a change in road conditions necessitates a reevaluation of driving style.<p>I would further contend that ""hidden questions"", such as the one described, test one's ability to take multiple choice tests. If I know A and B, I have no need for C and there is no need for me to even look at it. In fact, if there were 40 options, ""All of the Above"" still has to be the correct answer, even if I have no clue what the other 37 options are.<p>Teaching is not the intent of a test. Unless, of course, we are assuming that the test taker did not learn anything before taking the test; In which case the intent is not testing them at all but ensuring that they have some basic skills to get by.<p>However I agree with your intent, the creation of questions for a test is not a trivial pursuit.",1352070813

Regenerative medicine is the correct approach, the body has all the mechanisms already to regrow itself, after all, it did grow in the first. Regrowing the body and keeping it from being a cancerous growth is the actual challenge. Noninvasive surgery like radiosurgery, focused ultrasound, and photoacoustic surgery is the correct approach along with floating growth factors. This is not really biological engineering but electromechanical engineering and well within grasp. A proper effort would get this done within a year.",1352070361

Anything involving government issued IDs to social security and unemployment benefits are cut off until you ""regularize"" your status by paying the fine for not voting.<p>My biggest complaint is that the system forces even Brazilians living abroad to vote, which is a big pain in the ass when you are abroad since you aren't aware of elections (it's easy to forget) and you need to find the nearest consulate and figure out how to vote.

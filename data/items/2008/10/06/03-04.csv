Those cover all the major concepts to begin with, and switching to PHP or any similar language would be very quick if not instantaneous.<p>Then again, I think it's even a better idea to start with something fun and something you really and feel like you are getting rather than jumping to something really complicated.<p>There is no one-size-fits-all language to start with, it depends from person to person.",1223265522

Do it as soon as possible in your career, especially Lisp and C.  No matter what language you may use, you'll probably benefit from knowing these two.  The danger with any ""first language"" is that you may never learn a second.",1223265505
324599,comment,324295,324295,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This ""predicament"" is interesting to me, but not for the reasons that a lot of commenters are pointing out. Previously I didn't understand why someone would license their open source project under a BSD-like agreement as opposed to GPL. On the surface, it looks like you're completely giving away control of the work you've done, and that the only beneficiaries in the deal are those who aren't doing the work.<p>This situation made me realize the possibilities that a BSD-like license offers to both the original authors and subsequent contributors. If the project is interesting enough, it is feasible that multiple contributors could get hired by different companies to work on proprietary forks of the original BSD project, possibly with some kind of initial ""payout"" for signing a non-compete.<p>This seems to be a much better alternative to the GPL model, where the main alternatives are consulting, selling documentation, hoping for enough donation money to support you, or (the longshot) getting hired by a company which uses the project to continue open source development, bug fixes, and in-house modifications.",1223265483

324597,comment,324501,324501,0,0,mkn,,,"While these ""first programming language"" articles seem to be perennial favorites, we've reason to be skeptical on many grounds.<p>First, the authors never seem to be someone qualified to design a curriculum. No doubt they are all qualified coders with a reasonable amount of work behind them and a good understanding of machine fundamentals. However, curriculum design is a specialty, with it's own pitfalls and peculiarities. We may as well ask these authors what a good technique is for thoracic surgery is. They're equally qualified.<p>Second, while the authors are not qualified to design a pedagogy, they certainly seem to feel that they are, based on their own idiosyncratic experiences. This borders on egomania. ""I learned C/C++/Java/QBasic/Lisp first and look how awesome I am. Therefore, everyone should take my obviously optimum path to learning the One True Way of coding."" Is there no room for others to learn differently? To take a path different from one's own and still come to the same fundamental understanding and skill level?<p>Third, and finally, the various authors' lack of imagination considering curriculum design is staggering. Can they not imagine a gentle introduction to algorithmic science via any of the Turing-complete languages out there other than their first language of choice? Is there no room for variety? For example, can any of them answer definitively whether it is better, for any describable subset of students, for them to (1) ""learn the hard way"" by having to interrupt their focus on the problem at hand to compile c code into object files, hand them to the linker, and then run the executable or (2) forgo the 'obviously essential' details of x86 architecture so that they can hit Run in their lisp/sheme/python environment and see the immediate results? Clearly, in the first case, those that get through the trial by fire will have an easier time learning other languages. However, couldn't that be an indictment against compiles languages as a first language; that the learning curve is too steep?<p>In the face of the infinite variety of students, learning styles, teaching styles, learning environments, available hardware, and (most of all) pedagogical goals, I'm reminded in this case of a wonderful proverb taught to me by my high school English teacher: It is better to shut up and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.",1223265206

324584,comment,324035,324110,0,0,netcan,,,"You know, I never thought that free markets vs Communism made very good polar opposites. They don't cover the same sort of ground. They clash terribly over invisible hand vs command but Communism also covers a 17th- 18th centuryish theory of history at its core. What do free marketeers have to say to that?<p>The command vs freee hand, particularly for physical goods production has been largely decided. I think very few politicians left that would directly control production in a red sort of a way. They might for micro political reasons, but probably wouldn't try to control the economy some other way.<p>Marx got moulded into a religious figure.

I did 4-5 rounds of user-testing from usertesting.com and redesigned, but sure there is lot of room for improvement.<p>I think we need to do better job at explaining that we are not auction site and we are not trying to attract users who like auctions. Rather we are trying to attract people who like the price-negotiation and also Alibaba model.

I like being able to watch a short video to find out what a site can do without having to randomly click through to try to figure it out.<p>Here's the problem: you spend the first full minute of your video listing your competitors and talking about their process. I understand you're trying to build a comparison, but why don't you just show your product off and let people draw the comparison themselves? You could also put the comparison closer to the end. The longer the video is, the more people will drop off partway through, so you want them to see more about your site and less about your competitors.",1223262946

Most of the folks my parents have had over for dinner just nod and agree when my dad goes off on his conspiracy theories.  Where I went to college, many of the sociology courses had us reading about and discussing the power elite.  For my part, I'll freely admit that I think it's likely there are conspiracies by people in power against people not in power, I just don't think the ones we hear about are the real ones.  (Think about it: if these people were as powerful and clever as most conspiracy theories make them out to be, why would they let you know about it?)<p>Then the question always is: what do we do about it?<p>In one of your previous posts, you said: ""And our professor said that in AA meetings, the first step is recognizing there is a problem. The second step is getting angry. And the third is taking action or doing something about it.""  As a kid, I used to believe that complaining served a very real purpose, because it drew attention to the problem.  Didn't make me very popular.  I gave up that belief when I realized that nearly every competent person (including many of my peers) <i>already knew</i>, they just understood that they were not in a position to do anything about it, and thinking about it just made them miserable.<p>The big difference between AA and the world around us is that AA is all about your personal behavior, yet the world around you is <i>other people's</i> personal behavior.  Some wise person on the Internet once said, ""Control yourself, because you can't control others.""  Asking ""Why don't you do something about it?"" is the wrong question.  Asking ""Why don't <i>I</i> do something about it?"" is the right question, but finding an answer can be somewhat difficult.<p>Raganwald once wrote a great blog entry about ""dangerous ideas"".  I'm looking for them - one of the reasons I gave up on my last startup (other than I didn't think it'd work) was that even if it succeeded, it just made sheeple more sheeplike.  But dangerous ideas usually aren't obvious.  If you find one, run with it - maybe you'll be the one to change the world.",1223262374

8744998,comment,8743425,8743425,0,0,choppaface,,,"The story reads like a great example of how a war-time leader will obliterate a team if he fails to integrate.  Despite all the initial good karma between Hughes, Foer, and other editors, Hughes and the team clashed badly whenever Hughes&#x27; personal network risked damage due to TNR issues (e.g. the leak about Amazon pulling ads).  The article seems to set SV culture at odds with TNR, but I think there&#x27;s a much more basic explanation for the tragedy here: Hughes failed to integrate himself.  The very fact that Hughes felt it necessary to conceal the search for Foer&#x27;s replacement is a red flag that Hughes had no reason to ignore himself.<p>For a war-time leader to have a fighting chance, he&#x27;ll need to integrate himself and leverage the existing culture (and product).  Regardless of how much spin this article may cast, there&#x27;s plenty of undeniable evidence that Hughes failed to integrate.  Hughes brought this failure upon himself.",1418471968

Eight cars were outfitted with equipment from each candidate system.*<p>> <i>The systems would be driven around Paris and the system’s transmission capacity and ability to continuously correct errors would be measured in the city’s narrow, windy streets. The system that transmitted the most data with the fewest errors would win. At first, the international press did not think the Norwegian GSM contribution was likely to win. In September 1986, the journal Communications Systems Worldwide wrote:“Since ELAB is attached to a Technical institute and has no manufacturing capability, it would appear to have little chance of success.” However, when the test was finished, the conclusion was clear: The Norwegian system was best.</i><p><a href=""http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/2005-01e/gsm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/2005-01e/gsm.htm</a><p>> <i>All that was left was for a little known University based outfit from Norway to trundle around Paris with their lash-up of a narrow band TDMA system.

This ruby-like dict class probably doesnt belong in the std python lib, but it is nice to have in pypi because of the syntactic sugar. No denying that it is kind of a leaky abstraction, one might even say a hack, but it has the potential to be useful for concisely expressing nested key-value objects, as long as the object instantiation is explicit so a reader would immediately know what they&#x27;re working with. It&#x27;s really easy to implement something like this by inheriting from dict and setting some magic methods, but I feel like I find myself implementing Struct classes like this for myself because it can be more elegant sometimes than nested dicts. If the python community agrees on the correct semantics for a defaultdict-like object with __getattr__ and __settattr__ implementations, it might be more elegant than the status-quo for ad-hoc objects:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2827623/python-create-object-and-add-attributes-to-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2827623/python-create-obj...</a>",1418471542

I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s valid to extrapolate his experience to outside JS. I get the impression he&#x27;s teaching us how to avoid problems that we wouldn&#x27;t have (or less so) if we weren&#x27;t saddled with JS.<p>His enthusiasm for JS, meanwhile, seems a little misplaced. A language riddled with many horrible gotchas that inspired Mr. Crockford to write a book on how to avoid them? Why should we need to tiptoe around the fact that &quot;this&quot; means different things in different contexts? The &quot;prototypal functions that happen to contain data&quot; idiom is refreshingly different and interesting, but does it really offer advantages not found in &quot;conventional&quot; OOP or FP?<p>JS commands a huge following. But as Elliott hints at the beginning, its popularity is not a matter of choice. Netscape saddled us with a legacy where the API of every browser is necessarily JS. JS is the best language for programming browsers simply because it&#x27;s the only one. That it&#x27;s not a universal favorite is evidenced by the many projects that offer a &quot;cross compile to JS&quot; option. The users of those products would rather code in a different language.<p>All that said, a disclaimer: Though I&#x27;ve read _The Good Parts_ and other JS books, I avoid JS, I barely know JS, I have next to no experience with it and I suck at programming in it.

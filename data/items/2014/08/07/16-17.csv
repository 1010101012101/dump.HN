8148763,comment,8148345,8148345,2,0,joshcanhelp,,,"I finished a 2-month full-stack JS class here in Seattle in June and really enjoyed it. I am/was primarily a LAMP stack/WordPress developer and wanted to expand my mind and skill set a bit. I was one of 2 or 3 people in the class who had more than a couple of months of programming experience (~ 6 years in my case), the rest were very new to the discipline.<p>I really enjoyed the process but it&#x27;s very much a &quot;get out what you put in&quot; process. It was 6 hours per day, 5 days a week with homework. I could easily have doubled that time outside of class with additional reading, assignments, and projects. Still, I attended every lecture and finished all the assignments and now feel much more comfortable with the landscape in general.<p>The advantages a class has over self-directed learning are myriad:<p>- Paying for a class provides internal motivation to stay focused\n- Someone helps you decide what to learn and in what order\n- Most provide job-application assistance (my program in particular did an excellent job with this)\n- You have someone being paid to answer all of your questions\n- You have specific assignments to complete and are held accountable\n- Teaching those around you is the highest form of learning\n- You get a dedicated space to work and learn<p>From the other comments here, I fully agree that:<p>- &#x27;The quality of the &quot;graduates&quot; varied immensely&#x27;\n- &#x27;All of the projects were group projects, so weaker students were able to hide behind stronger students&#x27; - you get out what you put in\n- &#x27;COLLECT AS MANY SIGNALS ABOUT INSTRUCTION QUALITY AS POSSIBLE&#x27;\n- &#x27;I also learned how to work on a dev team, not just in my app-building silo&#x27;",1407430782

Although the cost of the system and the monthly subscription fees were high, the system was successful—it enjoyed a five-year run before it was discontinued in 2000.<p>I would never imagine such thing - games via satellite - ever existed, let alone for Famicom!<p>Living in Japan in the 90&#x27;s might be have been pretty amazing, it was like living in a retro version of the future. I remember when my friend came back from Japan and brought payphone cards, something I would only see again 10 years later in my country.",1407430759

8148753,comment,8148345,8148345,3,0,nthj,,,"I was the lead instructor for MakerSquare&#x27;s first cohort, and I&#x27;ve also taught shorter, on-site courses for clients like Comcast (Lord forgive me), Huffington Post, and LinkedIn. I&#x27;m also exclusively self-taught, no CS degree. Here&#x27;s my take.<p>You need to know your own learning style to make the decision on the investment. I&#x27;m pretty obsessive and learn things better on my own working towards a goal than I do in a classroom environment. (I was homeschooled, so whether I thrived in a homeschool environment because my brain works this way, or my brain works this way because I was homeschooled, or some of both, I&#x27;m not sure.) This plays out into my real life, too—my wife has found if she sends me follow-up emails on some things, I&#x27;m better able to act on it, as I have a lot of trouble retaining auditory information. (She is very gracious.)<p>But many people thrive in a classroom environment, and for them, a coding school and the energy of being in a room with 30 people driven towards a common goal makes starting the journey a lot easier. So, analyze your own learning style from the past, and weigh this into your decision.<p>Another angle to consider is that being in a program with MakerSquare is like getting into YC: it buys you access to a lot of wicked intelligent people who you might not get to rub shoulders with otherwise. I know some really, really smart developers in Austin. Many of them mentor MakerSquare students, and the students are privileged to have access to their time and expertise. If I could go back to when I first started learning and pay $20K to have these guys mentor me, I would do it in a heartbeat. But if you go this route, make a conscious effort to seek out their help and learn from them.<p>Finally, if cost is a major concern, I would look at Austin&#x27;s MakerSquare program. Cost of living is lower than say SF, tuition is lower (I think, haven&#x27;t cost compared in a while), and our community is very welcoming to motivated beginner developers.<p>Good luck!  I&#x27;m nj@third.io if you want to ask me more questions offline. :)",1407430680

But lets assume it for the sake of argument.<p>> Should immigrants receive the BLS? If yes, you go broke. If no, the immigrants are essentially second-class citizens who have to work for an extremely low wage (because they would have to pay indirectly for the BLS).<p>I think this claim is overly simplistic; also, I think there are several categories to consider,that I think you&#x27;ve failed to distinguish:<p>(1) Naturalized citizens should certainly receive whatever universal or guaranteed income is adopted, but immigrants don&#x27;t become naturalized citizens immediately.<p>(2) <i>Legal</i> immigrants (the number and characteristics of whom a democratic state <i>can</i> effectively regulate), who are not citizens, probably should be eligible for the support [1] as well, but may be admitted on criteria that include having means of support that make it less likely that immigrant will be a recipient (in a GMI scheme) or net recipient (in a BI scheme).<p>(3) Non-immigrant, but legally-present workers, visitors, etc. should not generally be eligible for the support. In the case of non-immigrant economic admission categories, adequate support means should be part of the conditions for admission. There may be some exceptions to this (note [1] again may apply to these exceptions) or some categories of non-immigrant admits that are qualified for alternative, status-specific support.<p>(4) Those illegally present probably should not be eligible for the benefits, but may be eligible for some kind of normalization of status process after which they would become legal immigrants who might be eligible for benefits (to which note [1] would apply again). This normalization process <i>might</i> include up-front payment of a fine for those with means, or commitment to income contingent future payment of the fine with nominal interest, and might even include limitations on benefit eligibility for some period even beyond what regular legal immigrants might face, or commitments to repay any benefits claimed during a certain transitional period on an income-contingent basis. (In general, payment for normalization -- or payment for above-quota legal immigration -- makes sense for individuals who are not personally barred, since limits on levels of such immigration are a cost-of-immigration control measure, and its better for people who want to immigrate to bear the costs then for society to bear the costs of inefficiently trying to keep them out, and then <i>also</i> bearing the costs of them coming in anyway.)<p>[1] As productivity advances and if the basic support improves to provide more than a very minimal floor, its not entirely unreasonable that non-citizens might recieve <i>less</i> than the full support level, however, possibly based on a sliding scale based on residency; in theoretical terms, in a rent on the commons model, this represents a kind of &quot;vesting&quot; process where the immigrant doesn&#x27;t become a full &quot;owner&quot; until they are naturalized; in practical terms it provides basic social support but reduces the immediate immigration incentive.",1407429850

Bootcamp > online courses.<p>I went through Fullstack Academy in NYC and received five job offers. (Full disclosure--worked as a teaching fellow at Fullstack shortly afterward, so I was on the payroll.) Had one of the best learning experiences of my life there. Absolutely worth the cost of tuition--there are real tangible pedagogical differences between distance/online learning like One Month Rails or Lynda and a physical classroom.

Currently, there are really only two data points prospective students can act on 1) the name-brand value of the first-to-market bootcamps, like App Academy and Hacker School, and 2) testimonials and hiring experiences of former students.<p>Neither of these data points are reliable. Plenty of students fall through the cracks at the oldest, most well-established bootcamps, and anecdotes (like this one, incidentally) can&#x27;t represent the average experience.<p>Even though I had a wonderful, incredibly-high-leverage experience at Fullstack, I&#x27;ve known students who have gone through other bootcamps and have had HORRIBLE experiences--lackadaisical instructors working on side projects, courses exclusively by recent grads of the bootcamp with no industry experience, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re considering bootcamps, COLLECT AS MANY SIGNALS ABOUT INSTRUCTION QUALITY AS POSSIBLE. This means speaking to former students, speaking to instructors and co-founders (if they&#x27;re a bootcamp of any quality, they&#x27;ll allow prospective students to chat with co-founders), sitting in on classes, visiting the school.<p>The bootcamp space is lucrative, and becoming increasingly crowded.

(It wasn&#x27;t GA)  A few observations:<p>* The quality of the &quot;graduates&quot; varied immensely.  Some graduates had been programmers before starting the course, and those students were just there to sharpen their skills.  Others had no background in programming.<p>* All of the projects were <i>group projects</i>, so weaker students were able to hide behind stronger students and couldn&#x27;t actually point at any code that they had been solely responsible for.<p>* All of the projects had been conceived of by the school, and so were very very limited in ambition and scope. (It took some digging to find this out, the groups were presenting their projects as if they had conceived of them)<p>* One of the student told me nearly verbatim: &quot;We learned more in 10 weeks than we would have in our first 2 years of a traditional C.S. degree.&quot;  I told this student that that was preposterous and to please never repeat that sentence again.<p>* The students had obviously been well prepped on their interviewing techniques and showed alot of enthusiasm and (over)confidence.  But the average proficiency level was way below junior programmer status, and for 2/3 of the students I didn&#x27;t see how they could work without active mentoring.<p>* I kept in touch with one of the students after graduation, and he said that virtually all of the students received offers .  So hey, the demand for programmers is really that high regardless of quality.  I couldn&#x27;t see hiring one of these devs for what seemed (at the time) to be a 70-80k starting salary range, when another 20k would get me a legitimate junior developer.

8148649,comment,8148345,8148345,3,0,daftstar,,,"Hi! I attended MakerSquare last fall.<p>I had joined the 2nd cohort at MakerSquare in fall of 2013. Prior to MakerSquare, I had tried learning Ruby and JS on my own, through countless books and online tutorials. Having completed a few guides, I realized that my ability to learn &quot;how to code&quot; was hindered simply by my style of learning. Moreover, while I had a good understanding of the basics, I had no idea what the &#x27;best practices&#x27; of coding were. After all, if you&#x27;re going to spend countless hours writing code, you might as well do it the right way, right?<p>Of the different programs out there, the one thing I would urge others to consider is that MakerSquare places a heavy amount of weight onto prework completed (how much work you&#x27;ve done ahead of time) and community-fit. If you&#x27;re a solo worker and not a fan of collaborative environments, you may want to consider other programs.<p>On a regular basis, we worked in teams of 2-5 ppl. The small groups were great for focused learning, and it turns out, the larger groups were great for learning how to collaborate on code with version control (github). Would I have had this opportunity through a self-learn environment? Definitely not.<p>Long story short, I would 100% recommend this program. As classmates, I had former programmers, retail store workers, a professional photographer and even a former elementary teacher. Out of the program, each of the students were working as professional front-end engineers (junior developers) within a few months of graduating. MakerSquare has a great professional network for helping with placement (96%), and they know how to teach software development.<p>The classroom environment (the location on Congress ave) was a bit cramped at times. But from what I&#x27;ve heard the class size is now capped at 20, vs. 30 or so when I went through.<p>All the &#x27;issues&#x27; I had (space constraints, less than ideal student:instructor ratio, and focus on advanced concepts (algorithms and data structures) has been completely addressed. According to the instructors, Cohort 7 is operating on a night/day difference of curriculum than what I had. As an example, we didn&#x27;t really touch data structures and algorithms until week 7 of the program. Today, those two themes are introduced on day 3 of the program.<p>The biggest difference now is that MakerSquare focuses on making sure you understand the fundamentals of software development. Before you even get to use a framework, (Rails, BackboneJS, AngularJS), you build your own version first.

Congratulations, son!<p>Yes, real-world software projects that make money for a business (and pay you a salary) are larger than one man can handle. There&#x27;s a lot of grunt work, and maybe only a handful of new and interesting things to do. At some point, you&#x27;re going to have to accept this, and just get on with it. If you work for a business, the goal is to make money, not to work on new, kewl, glamorous software projects all the time. Sometimes those goals do intersect, but it&#x27;s rare. It&#x27;s called &#x27;work&#x27; for a good reason.<p>It also sounds like you&#x27;re suffering from another common malady, and that is the idea that programming is all about writing code, and programming languages, and frameworks, and fast turnaround results. I think you&#x27;re starting to realize that this is not really the case, but you can&#x27;t figure out why, so you suppose that maybe it&#x27;s due to the insurmountable grandioseness that seems to surround even the smallest programming project. I think you&#x27;ve grown up under the spell of &quot;programming as an end in itself&quot;, and now the illusion is showing some cracks.<p>Look, programming is not an end in itself. It&#x27;s a way to express the solution to a computational problem. Think about that for a minute, or, preferably, the next week.<p>Programming languages are basically the same idea as mathematical notation - it&#x27;s a way to express an idea about how to solve a problem. Sure, there&#x27;s also the coolness of having a machine take your expression of how to solve a problem and actually solve it for you, but programming is still just a way to express the solution to a problem.<p>Look at all the posts we see everyday on HN and proggit about programming languages and frameworks and whatever the latest hare-brained language idea that the functional programming circle jerk fest has come up with. Man, it&#x27;s like going to a math conference and all everyone talks about is the latest ways to write down algebra! It&#x27;s no wonder that there&#x27;ve been no real fundamental advancements in computer science in the last 30 years.<p>I think you need to rewire your brain about the philosophy of programming, what it is, what it&#x27;s for, and what it&#x27;s not. You are at a crucial point where you need to decide if you&#x27;re ready to go up an abstraction layer, and start thinking more deeply about the various problems whose solutions may be expressible in a computation form, and stop worrying about programming languages, frameworks, and &quot;impact&quot;. If you don&#x27;t want to do that, then you might as well just be happy laying bricks and comparing trowels, and leave the hard thinking to more interested and capable people.",1407429246

I&#x27;m currently employed as a rails developer at a small company and I love what I do.

We have new results for multiple GPUs with up to 29 billion traversed edges per second on 64 K20 GPUs and 4.3 billion directed edges.  The multi-GPU code base is not yet the full MapGraph / GAS API, but we will be fixing that soon.  We will be extending the capabilities of the platform in a number of directions, including allowing multiple partitions per GPU so you can operate on graphs larger than the GPU RAM without having to scale-out, and so you can operate on huge graphs on GPU clusters.<p>GraphLab (a purely memory based system) is much faster than GraphChi (a disk-based system using the parallel sliding window algorithm). Both GraphLab and GraphChi use &quot;vertex cuts&quot; which amount to 2D partitioning, which is what we use in the multi-GPU version MapGraph.  This is also what is used by the world record holder for BFS traversal, which is the Blue Gene/Q.<p>We used the synchronous engine for GraphLab and the specified version of graphlab because that is what existed and worked (without segfaults) when we collected the data for the SIGMOD paper in the summer of 2013.  We did cross-check the performance of GraphLab with the GraphLab developers.<p>One of the main reasons that CPU parallel graph algorithms slow down is because they hit the memory bandwidth of the bus.  GPUs have 10x or more memory bandwidth.  The K20 has 204 GB/s. The K40 has 288 GB/s.  The Pascal GPU (2016) will have over 1 TB/s of memory bandwidth and 24 GB of RAM.<p>I&#x27;ve listed the MapGraph Publications below.

The spaceship itself won&#x27;t, but the total system (&#x27;bubble&#x27;, contents and ship together) will increase in momentum to an outside observer.  I agree that it may be impossible to construct, but it&#x27;s theoretically possible.<p>According to the experiments, the drive seems reactionless so far.  It&#x27;s possible that it does emit something that we can not measure, it&#x27;s also possible that it transfers momentum to something else, or that it works on something else entirely.  We simply don&#x27;t know yet.  There is potential here, if there does turn out to be experimental evidence for it being truly reactionless, for that to require an addition to physics.  Even if the evidence turns up something else, it&#x27;ll at least be interesting.<p>I agree that there are a lot of ifs, ors and buts.  That&#x27;s why everybody is calling for independent confirmation.  Just like the neutrino case, that&#x27;s how science is supposed to work.

On almost any other site, message board, subreddit, or commenting section, you&#x27;d expect to see downvotes&#x27; becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy every time. The second something is &#x27;in the grey,&#x27; it stays there, and gets worse. On HN, certain measures prevent that from happening -- but people also go to the trouble of upvoting things out of the grey, which is highly unusual by Intenet standards.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to look at the group psychology of downvoting. The second something appears grey, a threshold has been crossed. A signal is raised. Everyone else who swings by sees a sort of implicit permission to downvote the comment, because it&#x27;s already been downvoted, and hence, <i>something</i> about it must be worth downvoting. Before someone even reads the comment, they approach it with a downvote-ready mentality. You&#x27;re conditioned to react negatively to a grey comment <i>even before you read it</i>, and that&#x27;s a very powerful prompt.<p>HN self-corrects in a lot of cases, and that&#x27;s interesting not only in the context of the Internet at large, but also in the context of human psychology. To read a greying comment with an open mind, and then go against the evident grain to re-upvote it, requires conscious and considered thought. It requires the activation of what Kahneman would call &quot;System 2.&quot;[1] Most people don&#x27;t vote in System 2; they vote in System 1.[2] HN seems to be different, and that&#x27;s no small feat.

The current programmer/developer/whatever job market strongly favors employees -- if you have solid technical chops, you probably have your pick of jobs all across the industry, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason why you should have to accept a &quot;soul-crushingly boring&quot; job where your value is so poorly appreciated that you have to resort to scheming to justify your continued employment, or where anybody gives a shit about job titles.

Arguably the 20 that they chose could do <i>anything</i> to their homepages and still soldier on successfully - the fact they all follow the same trends doesn&#x27;t give any insight in to what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Take the &#x27;they all have a slogan&#x27; lesson as an example: having a slogan might have killed 50,000 startups and these 20 are the set that were lucky enough to have done everything right to survive in spite of that huge error.<p>If you&#x27;re going to examine homepages to learn what works, you have to look at the failed startups as well as the successful ones.

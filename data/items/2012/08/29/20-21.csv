4451203,comment,4450638,4450983,7,0,taligent,,,"This idea that MongoDB is dangerous is just crazy and seems to often come from the same people who endlessly tout PostgreSQL as the world's most perfect database. The fact is that very large companies are using MongoDB in production environments. Yes. MongoDB still has some issues in particular the write locks but the situation is improving pretty rapidly and almost exclusively affects very high end users.<p>So the answer to your question is simple. Use what matches your data model. MySQL if your data is more relational as it is proven and well known. MongoDB is perfect when you treat it like a document store.  For example I fetch one User object (with all the user's data self contained) from the database and do everything client side. So in my case MongoDB works perfect.<p>But either way. Do whatever gets you up to speed the fastest.",1346273993

And if refused a license, any potential licensee can buy the remaining years of the patent at the initial annual price (= portfolio value / portfolio lifetime).<p>So if the patent has value but the inventor has set the price too low to save on fees, someone can buy it and make better use of it. And setting the price too high would have to be a reflection of the inventor's trust that the patent is worth it since the inventor is going to have to pay for it each year.<p>If it sounds unfair between big companies and small companies and individuals, some relative pricing can be established using percentages of the inventor's turnover / annual income.

4451170,comment,4450904,4450904,1,0,jfaucett,,,"good article it brings up some interesting points. Here's my perspective on the issue. I think I (and most PHP developers) would agree that other languages are leaps and bounds better. I'm a software developer, I program in java, c, c++, and PHP, and here's the odd thing about PHP - its completely worthless for everything EXCEPT web development, and even for webdev its really only optimal for solutions that are not enterprise or at a massive-scale (i.e. twitter,facebook). But for everything else its great (for reasons below) and the thing is for most web development the ""everything else"" is the umbrella under which most clients come for the majority of developers. Here's why I think its great and its my default language for most web development contracts I get, in short its the tools you get, but here's the long of it:<p>1. Top notch CMS solutions (Drupal, Typo3) that allow you to develop and deploy and be done extremely fast. Throw a proxy cache like varnish in, and the site also rolls out raging fast, for most news,magazines,etc with a couple hundred thousands visitors daily, you're up and ready in no-time.<p>2. Frameworks galor when you need it, and honestly speed again here is my biggest plus, take Symfony plus Doctrine for ORM, and you can knock out midsized projects that require applike stuff in a fraction of the time you'd need with java.<p>3. The ease with which anyone can edit/maintain/update the project. I know, clients know that if a project is programmed in PHP its gonna be cheap and easy to find a dev, so you build it deliver it and basta. With something like Java its gonna be more difficult.<p>I realize none of these points have anything to do with PHP as a language in and of itself, but honestly, the tools are all that matters unless you just want to spend time programming - which I don't, I want to get paid, be done, have produced a clean, maintable project, etc. And PHP as is in 5.3/4 has namespaces (finally), and is well designed enough that if you know software design you can dev fast.",1346273776

Couple golang's preference for large statically-linked binaries with a one-folder, one-executable install convention and Linux may become more inviting for non-nix apps.<p>For example, imagine ""/outside/myapp/myapp"" is a large, unix-unfriendly, statically-compiled binary placed in it's folder by a OS-provided install utility. ""Myapp"" was probably developed for Mac or Windows and by design does not give a damn about /etc, /lib, /var, etc. These app should just be allowed to crap their configuration files into the home directory into which it has been placed (""/outside/myapp""). If one no longer needs the app, the folder is deleted along with everything else the app created while it was being used. Tidy. Behind the scenes such an app would be compiled to call the standard Linux APIs, yet it would probably avoid any dynamic dependencies. Disk space is cheap. Just bundle it all together and throw it somewhere where it can run in peace.<p>Amiga's icon files are another approach. Rather than a large, monolithic registry tracking everything in the system, executables exist in tandem with an ""icon"" (.info) file. This file is generated by the OS and tracks the executable's location and other settings in the workbench (desktop). A modern reincarnation could potentially track anything. Instead of accumulating registry filth with every uninstall one can simply remove an executable and its associated .info file. Instead of adhering to the heir convention, the app plays nicely in its own folder with it's own registry. By using an "".info"" file, portable non-nix installs could reside anywhere, and not in a prefabbed ""/outside"" folder.<p>The smartphone penchant for portable installation should come to nix, particularly with non-unix software. It should be encouraged, and that's coming from an OpenBSD user. Unix needs a playground for non-unix apps.",1346273049

Most minor UI/desktop-related tasks that are hassle-free with Win7 or OSX take far too much time. Time that most people don't have and don't want to invest.<p>Example: doubleclicking on a .ttf file in the Xfce file manager (plain Debian Xfce) does nothing. Right-clicking offers various unrelated applications. Copying the file to an appropriate font directory does not ""install"" the font so it is visible to applications. No, I have to shut down all terminal windows and restart them to be able to use the font. Do you see an advantage in this? I don't want to spend time doing (or even researching) this when I could be developing instead (with the best console font known to mankind please!). Desktop Linux just lacks basic functionality and wastes people's time.<p>Sure, I was fine developing with fvwm2 or twm 15 years ago and did not mind using xfontsel and ""xset fp rehash"" back then, but today it feels like an unproductive waste of time when Win7 and OSX (esp. OSX) do not ""get in my way"" in any conceivable meaning of the phrase when I just want to develop stuff in an environment that I can adjust to my liking.<p>If you think Linux on the desktop hasn't failed for and abandoned by <i>most</i> technical users, you're delusional.",1346272644

I've been hacking on Django since 0.96. I love the ORM, and hate everything else. Python on the other hand is a wonderful language. Rails... I've been spending 8 hours a day for the past month building a rails project. I love a lot of things about rails, hate the ORM, and dislike a lot of the magic.<p>On the flip side: I've been a Javascript/front-end developer since before jQuery existed, and I love coffeescript. I understand callback-style evented programming and therefore node.js apps make perfect sense to me.<p>My co-founder and I have just finished some heavy duty design/wireframe/conceptual work on a new project of ours. It's time to build the API.<p>I am COMPLETELY torn with what framework/language/database to use for this project.<p>At first I thought mongodb and coffeescript+node would be fun and reliable. But the community seems to think mongo is unreliable and almost dangerous. So I thought, hmm, Riak looks like it will let me throw whatever data I want into it (like mongo) but it's rock solid. I later dismissed that since I figured I'd need to do a lot of heavy lifting on my own. Rails keeps poking me in the back of my mind but I honest-to-god hate ActiveRecord and am afraid to use DataMapper for fear it won't play nice with a lot of the popular ruby goodies out there.

4450914,comment,4449241,4449241,-2,0,gbz,,,"Too much ink has been spilled on this topic but most arguments against software patents continue to be patently confused and unelightened about the core matters. For one, patents do not exist purely to 'incentivize', but also for reasons of fairness and justice. If software patents should be abolished, why exactly do we need copyright laws? Why don't we allow any book/paper/poem to be copied and resold by anyone under their own name? Why don't we allow people to make derivative copies of say harry potter books and build their own fortune? Im sure society wont be worse off for it.<p>Second, the problem with the patent system isn't that patents are given too easily (trust me, its not that easy), or to obvious things -- as they say, all beautiful solutions are obvious in hindsight -- but that companies that infringe patents have convinced themselves that they are within their right to do so. There's definitely a strong case for giving immunity to companies below a certain size (revenue, employee base etc) from patent prosecution, but most large companies can easily license patents but refuse to. Yes, there are still abuses of the system, but those are bound to arise no matter what system you put in place.. someone will always try to game it. And as software patents are litigated, common law will settle down on standards and businesses will know whats kosher and whats not. Much of the current excitement is because we are currently in the midst of the first explosion in assertion of software patents where common law is still evolving.<p>Last, many of the claims being made regarding the supposed absurdity of apple's patent claims are so fundamentally (or willfully?) uninformed, that it begs wonder (not very unlike the willful distortion of news from other countries thats so common in major western news platforms). Apple never really asserted a patent on a rectanle with round edges.. and as for its claims on UI elements -- it was a trade dress claim primarily, not patent claim. The bounce back and tap to zoom claims were patent claims -- but rest assured, micrsoft would probably have implemented the same with no bounce back and context menus to zoom. (no ms office app after 30+ yrs in mkt still has bounce back -- so maybe its not that obvious).

Some things need to be walked back.<p>For example, as a Physicist by training, most of the math I had to do was far more easily worked out by hand than fiddling around with a computer to do it.<p>When you're thinking through a problem pencil and paper are often a better medium than computers.  Conversely where once I would have drafted letters and articles by hand, it's way faster nowadays to type into a word processor or tool like Evernote and keep coming back to improve something.<p>I still pay some bills by check as it fits the specific case better.  But some online bill payment, or travel booking is better done online, as you correctly suggest.<p>...that being said, I wish I could call a travel agent and get it all booked nowadays, but they've been put out of business by book-it-yourself websites.  Before these sites you may have been calling a travel agent but they were using a computer too so it's not so much the move to computation that's changed this last 10-20 years but disintermediation of the middle man.

CL's real target is 3Taps, which is where PM gets its data. If CL loses the lawsuit, the most valuable piece for developers remaining will be CL images. 3Taps' API includes links to those images, as well as much other useful data, but CL is never going to let developers hotlink to the pictures it hosts. (One could launder those image links through a 3rd party service, but the scope is too large to be undetectable, besides it introduces an ethical issue.)

I know plenty of users of Windows and OS X who run virtual Linux Desktop distributions for testing/development/security. I'm sure some of HN are running Linux.<p>Does Linux have the potential to enter the market as a third core option for desktop usage - not really. But why does it matter?<p>The problem with Linux is that there are too many choices. People who like technical choices and options trend toward Linux (needs citation).<p>John Q. ComputerUser isn't going to use Linux unless his geeky son or nephew installs it for him AND provides support. He can't get support anywhere else - because there are too many possibilities for it to be fiscally effective.<p>If/When something gets confusing or broken on Windows/OS X, you call JoeBob's SuperDuperPuter, and say it's broken. JoeBob asks, ""What Windows version?"" While he might need to poke and pry a bit to get the user to tell him he's running Millenium edition, once he gets that data, it's a pretty straightforward troubleshooting effort and fix.<p>If you call some mythical Computer Service group that actually supports Linux, and say your machine is broken, they would need to know a LOT more about your system just to figure what they need to do to start.<p>Distribution? Parent Distribution? Shell? Window Manager? Hardware? ...<p>I find generic computer service companies to be extremely expensive. To be able to provide even basic service for Linux in general, your techs need to be very familiar with more operating systems (emerge, apt, yum, zypper, pacman), and more core applications. Each service effort inherently takes longer. These factors pile up and everything becomes necessarily more expensive. It's downright impractical to support Linux generically. The support costs for one or two issues on Linux would far outweigh the cost of an upfront OS license and cheaper support for the end user.<p>Linux has (and will likely continue to have) a comfortable hold on the technically-capable DIY market.

Avatar is one long, beautiful mathematical expression, from beginning to end.<p>Can you elaborate? To me, the interesting part of mathematics is the process of manipulating expressions, not the expressions themselves. For example, the number pi would be pretty boring if it weren't for the theorems related to it.",1346270533

4450761,comment,4450244,4450474,14,0,wpietri,,,"<i>So in that light, I think the idea that the Linux desktop got ""killed"" is sort of missing the point. It's no more moribund now than it was before.</i><p>I strongly disagree. It is losing exactly the sort of person that the author is: developers who, all else equal, would rather use Linux. But who eventually get tired of the BS and just want something that works and you can actually get software for. I have a lot of sympathy for that.<p>I write this from a Linux laptop, but that's more out of mulish stubbornness and 15 years of accumulated irritation with Steve Jobs and his dickish business practices.<p>The last time I got a new laptop I knew I didn't have time to screw around for days with X configuration files. And so I paid a vendor several hundred dollars over list to give me a laptop that JFW. And despite that the sound is still way too quiet. After a few time-boxed 2-hour excursions into whatever sound system they're using this week, I still can't fix it. I've given up.<p>The only legitimate reason I have for staying on desktop Linux is that I code for Linux servers, and I think it's impossible to really understand system performance if you're not running the same OS. But even that seems shaky to me; hardware keeps getting cheaper and developers keep getting more expensive, so it just doesn't matter as much.<p>One day some bright Linux spark is going to ""innovate"" again in a way that I'm expected to put up with their rough edges for 6 months (hello, Unity!) and I'm going to say fuck it and buy a Mac because I just don't have time to screw around right then. Or maybe I'll just want to watch a Netflix movie without hassle, or play the video game my pals are all talking about. And maybe by then it will be a fancy dock for my 8-core Android phone.<p>Overall, I agree with his point, except that I don't think Linux on the desktop is so much dying as cutting its own throat.",1346270528

It occurred to me that there are two classes of problems one encounters throughout the life of startups. They are not the same and require different solutions.<p>One class, the Problems of Inertia, contains things like getting started, releasing, and finishing. Solving Problems of Inertia means doing whatever is needed to get moving, to overcome fear, to ignore doubt. These problems are mostly pyschological and social. We all know what these are. Once a course of action has been evaluated, options are limited. Either do it, or dont. This does not require great intuition or judgement or analysis. The important part here, however is that there is great cost to not acting and that is that things stay the same. Acting, however, creates momentum.<p>Problems of Momentum, contains things like changing a product, scaling, and exiting. Solving Problems of Momentum means doing a more subtle analysis, weighing many choices, and relying on intuition and judgement. There are more options and choosing among them is less psychological and more a rational cost/benefit and risk/reward evaluation. The important part here is that not acting is a valid choice because you have momentum.<p>So its important to understand what kind of a problem one is facing so that one may either suck it up and do it or follow a more subtle decision process.  All in all I would rather face a Problem of Momentum!",1346270426

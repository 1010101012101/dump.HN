Is there really a need to store this in a highly relational single storage way? I'm not enough of a power user to have seen the nuances around the more advanced features to know for sure. Can anyone enlighten me?",1211510540
197741,comment,197182,197229,0,0,Diogenes,,,"The specs on the newer vostro line of Dell laptops are pretty impressive for the price.  Best value in my opinion.  Dual core processors, 2GB RAM, separate 256MB video, choice of screen sizes/weights, DVD+/-RW, built in camera, 160Gb+ HDD, choice of OS and that's starting at around $700 new.<p>They're not pretty, but they are highly functional, don't suffer from the quality issues Dell had circa 2002 - 2006, and if something breaks or you need a peripheral of some sort, you won't be in hock to Apple for half the cost of the machine or more.",1211510220

197734,comment,197525,197690,0,0,krschultz,,,"Its not free speech. Free speech is protected by law. By framing it as ""free speech"" you are saying anyone against this man is against free speech. He can say whatever the hell he wants, but it is not protected free speech. All the people who cry ""BUT FREE SPEECH"" on the internet whenever someone gets banned are idiots. The constitution protects you from the government, specifically the federal government, not from corporations acting within their own rights. If you can't understand something that basic, then I truly don't value your opinion.",1211508654

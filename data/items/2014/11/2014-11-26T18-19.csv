I remember there was a time where &quot;learning how to use git&quot; was something I really wanted to do for a _long_ time but never committed to it. Running into this online tutorial, as limited as it may be, was the day I said &quot;that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m gonna learn how to use git.&quot; I was successful. It was just enough of a push that I needed at the time.",1417028379

8663977,comment,8663303,8663303,0,0,WildUtah,,,"In all the discussion about Silicon Valley and why no place else has been able to have quite so much success in high tech, subtle cultural issues can be underemphasized because they aren&#x27;t easily quantified. This attitude toward freedom of speech and data in the EU is one reason why startups don&#x27;t prosper as well there.<p>For a society to allow and even encourage independent people to create new ways to collaborate with data is risky to existing powers. Most societies place restrictions on who can know or say things and then impose severe consequences on the people about whom those things are said. Sometimes the restrictions and consequences are informal. There may be a strong norm against sharing data or gossiping or spying or publishing. There may be a strong sense of reputation or face or a presumption that bad things said about you make you a bad person and unemployable.<p>The EU is a place where people have lived with the idea that central authorities can tell individuals what to say or not say for a long time. The large news and data institutions and churches have strong links to the state and individuals are not expected to be able to make choices about information for themselves. Political parties are routinely banned and prosecuted solely for disagreeing with ruling parties; elected officials have been prosecuted and jailed in France and the Netherlands in this decade merely for being leaders of the minority parties in their national and EU legislatures. [0] A certain confidence that anything officially published is endorsed by powerful people lingers weakly as a result. People don&#x27;t like small companies, startups, individuals controlling data as a result.<p>China and Japan are the same, though each in its own way, of course, just as each European culture is different.<p>But America is an outlier. We trust our government and newspapers less. We expect authorities&#x27; pronouncements to have less effect on our prospects and reputations. We share data freely and expect that people can gossip about us freely with limited consequences. We even expect a certain amount of lying to go on without being prohibited, though it upsets us more because we&#x27;ve developed stronger norms against it than nations where authorities are expected to have the power routinely to deceive the people like the EU.<p>And in tech, where information is everything, that cultural approbation for data is deeply though subtly influential. It&#x27;s one of the many things that make US startups and especially Silicon Valley ones more successful.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to day that this EU decision is a bad thing for startups. It&#x27;s bad for Google, but that&#x27;s not all startups. It creates an opening for an American company to provide a search engine that fills in Google&#x27;s EU gaps. EU companies might be able to find ways to exploit it, too.<p>It does reflect one of the cultural advantages of Silicon Valley, though. Along with the esteem for entrepreneurs, openness to failure, flexible job market, and network effects, freedom of speech is a business advantage in tech.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Geert_Wilders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Geert_Wilders</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/marine-le-pen-immunity-lifted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/marine-le-pen-i...</a>",1417028182

I have faced alot of issue where idiot managers think that mastering right-click and double-click is close to mastering programming. I was told in 1999 that MS Frontpage will make web developers & designers obsolete. The last thing we need is people claiming that you can become a software developer in couple of weeks.
Software Development(Programming & Testing) is a science that needs a understanding of systems. Coding is a BIT simpler process. I have experience teaching my friend programming in school and collage. May be I am a bad teacher, but I feel its a complex process and couple or weeks is too less of a time. Learning syntax will take just hours but writing readable and extendable code in the most efficient manager is what ensures a steady paycheck.
DBA admin is also a rather under-rated job. 
I too suggest Level 1 & 2 IT support for starters. Testing & QA also seems like a easy to learn process.",1417027519

Then we work to get them declared as a protected class, and then we fight for their rights using that protected status as leverage.<p>> Instead, we should do a better job of understanding what rights entitle us to, and then simply afford those rights to all people<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t think you understand the process you refer to in the preceding paragraph represents -- it represents an evolving understanding of what rights people should have (note that this is an evolving social consensus, not an evolving understanding of something which exists as an external material fact), followed by corrective efforts to address manners in which the status quo situation differs from the evolving social consensus of the desired situation. The entire idea of a &quot;protected class&quot; is that it is one which has in recent history been actively discrimated against in a manner which violates the current social norm, such that there is a heightened presumption that acts which have a disparate impact on that class are invalid as discrimination on that basis rather than simply incidental impacts of some permissible distinction. It is part of a process aimed at <i>realizing</i> and <i>securing</i> the new understanding of &quot;what rights entitle us to&quot; by eradicating residual practices that were accepted under a previous, more limited understanding.<p>Particularly, its important to understand that one issue is that our general understanding of what our rights entitle us to include that they generally <i>do</i> entitle us to discriminate according to our own personal biases, where that doesn&#x27;t cause unwarranted social harm -- but the understanding of what causes unwarranted social harm is evolving.",1417027515

Insider trading is a fairly specific concept, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be relevant here (for example, this informal description is clear enough and doesn&#x27;t apply: <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm</a>).<p>When a company trades with a bank to manage its risk, it <i>gives information away</i> by telling the bank that it wants to trade. That is not &quot;insider&quot; information at all. What it gets in return depends on how the company negotiates the price; it could get nothing at all, in which case it&#x27;s a bit of a failure on its part. The bank is under no obligation to not use that information to make guesses about the market situation. That information is valuable to the bank, and the bank might even offer discounts to the client to get the client to trade with it first.<p>If the company believes it leaves money on the table by disclosing the information about its order flow, it&#x27;s free not to deal with the bank. What you&#x27;re describing is mostly market-making, there&#x27;s no insider trading here.<p>P.S. Another thing this is not is front-running. If you come to me wanting to trade, I trade with you, complete the trade, then decide for myself that you&#x27;re clever and you probably know where the price will go, then trade for myself, that is not front-running because of the order in which those things happened. If you &quot;leave money on the table&quot; by disclosing to me what you know about the price and I take advantage of that, conventional market theory says it&#x27;s kind of your own fault, regardless of how unhappy you are about it. There are things you can do to <i>not</i> disclose such things, such as trading with many dealers at once. In fact, the skill of trading without moving the market is really valuable.",1417027341

You use some computational procedure which is developed along with that proof. For a layman it might seem there&#x27;s no difference, but difference is huge. For Pythagoras himself and other people who used this simple procedure in that time it was more like physical quality of the real world, one of many procedures used to divide land on parcels (hence <i>geo</i>metry, by the way). The &quot;mathematical&quot; part of his philosophy was more like religious practice with peculiar ideas, than what anybody calls &quot;math&quot; today.<p>The problem of &quot;proof&quot; didn&#x27;t exit back then. What is proof? What looks like correct reasoning to <i>me</i>, that&#x27;s what it is! And that was like a fine definition for every sane for a very, very long time. Have you read Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;? It was way later that Pythagoras, Kant was obviously quite smart man and his reasoning was pretty solid for his time. Now it&#x27;s nonsense. Because Euclidean geometry was considered the only possible back then, and Kant indeed believed it&#x27;s the only possible. Then some 100 years later it just <i>appeared</i> out of nowhere. That&#x27;s when a problem of &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;formal reasoning&quot; was actually started to be considered. And only <i>really</i> became a problem after Goëdel. The whole math you use every day by making cell-phones, building atomic reactors and launching rockets to the Moon was mostly invented before that by people who weren&#x27;t <i>so</i> concerned by proofs, the central object of mathematics today.<p>Similarly, you use just some formula you was taught at one point, and some semi-intuitive rules by which you can derive other formulas from it and don&#x27;t really care about proofs. And although you without doubt have heard about Lobachevsky and Riemann and even Klein, and heard of &quot;Erlang&quot; (even if it&#x27;s just a name of programming language to you) you don&#x27;t really think much about Pythagorean&#x27;s Theorem&#x27;s proof and what it&#x27;s built on, you use some computational methods you&#x27;ve been taught and what seems like &quot;correct reasoning&quot; to you. Actually, you even reinforced that by your examples, because there&#x27;s many more ways to calculate a &quot;distance&quot; inside matrices or in a video game (and on plain Earth it&#x27;s more based on physical properties you care for and would be fine even if only &quot;proved&quot; empirically). Because &quot;distance&quot; is not <i>derived from</i> Pythagorean Theorem, distance is <i>defined</i> and is one of key properties of some geometry. That is, you <i>define</i> geometry by introducing formula of how <i>distance</i> is calculated.",1417027326

I solved it by using the fact that when you remove mass the center of mass moves away from the mass you removed, so the minimum will occur when the height of soda matches the height of the center of mass. This gives the equation:<p><pre><code>    (1/2 c + (1/2 h) (h f)) / (c + h f) = h
</code></pre>
Where c is the mass of the can, the can has height 1, h is the height of soda remaining in the can, and f is the mass of the fluid when the can is full. (Incidentally, I wrote this equation wrong like eight times because I kept missing a factor of h in the fluid&#x27;s center of mass height.)<p>Working the equation:<p><pre><code>    c + h^2 f = 2 h (c + h f)
    f h^2 + 2 c h - c = 0
</code></pre>
Oh hey this will get simpler if we just look at the ratio:<p><pre><code>    let r = c/f
    h^2 + 2 r h - r = 0
    h = -r +- sqrt(r^2 + r)
    h = sqrt(r^2 + r) - r
</code></pre>
Well that&#x27;s kind of gross. I&#x27;m actually surprised it&#x27;s in the right range based on how it looks (but plotting it shows it is in fact in [0, 0.5]). Maybe the values from the problem are nice:<p><pre><code>    r = 1.5/12 = 3/24
    h = sqrt((3/24)^2 + 3/24) - 3/24
    h = 1/4

Well, you suggest, sure we can, but why not just have it decentralized if we can?<p>Because it&#x27;s expensive. It&#x27;s expensive in terms of engineering to interface with the blockchain, it&#x27;s expensive to wait for blockchain confirmations, it&#x27;s expensive to rely on the non-malevolence of a few mining pools.

We also need to understand what the actual barriers are to progress, and address them.<p>Let me give a good example.  A few years ago there was a fascinating longitudinal study that started with an equivalent group of blacks and whites.  All educated, young, middle class professionals in similar jobs.  Following them forward 15 years, the whites by and large were still middle class professionals, but a large portion of the blacks were living in poverty.  Proof of racism, right?<p>Not at all!  Their data had more detail in it.  One of the factors that they were able to control for was fiscal planning.  One was whether people understood the value of creating savings for themselves so that they could handle short-term challenges like a layoff.  When they controlled for this factor, blacks and whites were identical.  But more whites knew to do this, so they did better.<p>The solution to this particular problem is NOT to give blacks more opportunities and preferences.  It is to make an effort to educate the black community the importance of always living within your means.",1417026556

That&#x27;s a low-traffic situation. The problem comes when you&#x27;re at a 4-way stop and people are coming from every direction. Anyone who wants to go through the intersection needs the cars from at least <i>two</i> other directions to let them through. So you, as one person, waving them through is pointless because at least one other person would also have to independently decide to let them through as well. If that doesn&#x27;t happen, then either the other car listens to you and goes through the intersection and crashes into the third person who didn&#x27;t wave them through, or you and the other car both end up waiting when only one of you needs to be. Either way, you&#x27;re being rude to the people behind you, whose trip you have lengthened by the same amount you might have shortened someone else&#x27;s trip, all the while making the intersection less predictable. Of course, there&#x27;s always a race condition and potential for deadlock when two cars arrive simultaneously at an empty intersection, and waving people through is a safe and necessary way to solve that. But that&#x27;s not an issue here, because if an intersection already has cars waiting to go from all four directions, there&#x27;s a defined order in which they take turns according to the rules.",1417025242

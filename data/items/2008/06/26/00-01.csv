228118,comment,228112,228112,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"This is a great application of the live microblogging concept.  People simply love to get live updates about sports specially when you at work. Every live game spectator has a mobile phone, I can imagine them sending thousands of updates per game.<p>I do not care for sports, but this is one great idea.",1214441865

228114,comment,227621,227955,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>CS is basically a branch of applied mathematics, and is interesting enough. But it doesn't even remotely approach the kind of profundity you see in the basic sciences.</i><p>I guess we'll have to disagree, but I think artificial intelligence, machine learning, complexity theory (PCP theorem, zero knowledge proofs, etc), and algorithmic information theory (Chatin's number, etc.) are as interesting and profound as anything in the basic sciences. CS also has the advantage that much of the field is still in development, unlike almost every other field of science.<p><i>I'm really more of a scientist by training.</i><p>No offense, but completing most of an undergrad physics degree doesn't make you a ""scientist by training"". To be a properly trained scientist, I think you need to have done multiple pieces of significant, original research, and more than likely have a PhD.",1214441308

For starters, it makes the argument that because Thursday is the best day to post, and noon the best time, therefore Thursday at noon is the best time to post. Which does not follow. Plus it talks about time zones a bit, but doesn't seem to clue into the fact that using a different timezone for your data would actually change your per-day results.",1214440654

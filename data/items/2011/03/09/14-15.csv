In Rails, for example, if you have an external API call which routinely takes 3 seconds to complete, then that call costs about three hundred megabyte-seconds of RAM time to service, because the 100 MB or so used by your mongrel is effectively worthless while you wait.<p>When you run into resource constraints in Rails, odds are you are running out of RAM first.  It's a memory munching beast in most common deployment scenarios.<p>It is much more efficient to offload those blocking requests to a worker process and poll for results, since a single mongrel can blow through <i>lots</i> of poll requests <i>and</i> useful work in five seconds.  Bonus points: your web app will feel snappier, because progressive rendering tricks users into thinking 5 seconds is not actually 5 seconds.",1299680551

Not knowing whether your app is going to work when you push it is not fun.<p>From a maintenance perspective and assuming that a problem will show up in integration testing or via a bug report, further testing is only really useful to the extent that it lets you debug a failure faster. However that acceleration is a tradeoff against the time taken to write the tests in the first place - ergo: is it really worth it?<p>I personally don't think the real win from tests is in saving debugging time. I have found it's in making it quicker to write code. I know that sounds crazy as most people view tests as overhead but I view them as development tools.<p>The key to them being useful though is writing them before you write the code. If you write them afterwards you will have already verified the code in an ad-hoc fashion and the tests are pure overhead. If you write them before they do the verification for you.<p>I'm coding in Rails and I've found the outside-in approach to development: write the six line Cucumber integration test and then write the RSpec expectations for the object; act as a verified to-do list and make my development far more efficient and robust.<p>I'm sure that other developers with better focus than I might not get the same benefit but I find it tremendously useful to immediately list down all of the edge cases and general behaviour that a piece of code should exhibit and then keep coding till growl glows green. I trade the time that I'd otherwise spend faffing around in a browser or a debugger for  writing tests instead.<p>It's a bonus that all of those tests then ensure ongoing integrity, the real win is that tests stop me from wandering around the trail and keep me knocking things off in the order that they need to be done.

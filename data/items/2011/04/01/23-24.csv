2398627,comment,2397680,2397680,4,0,aridiculous,,,"This thread is making me reflect on my 7-8 years of using Facebook.<p>To be honest, I'm surprised I'm still on it, but I am. It's the best way for me to send media bits to people I like. It's easier than email for me.<p>However, I'm a sharer, and many people I know aren't. I don't really have a clue why they're on Facebook then (if they are). It does seem kind of dry.<p>In college, it was awesome because it was a community setting where you could find out about acquaintances (i.e. stalking) in a trusted network setting. It was OPEN within a CLOSED off system. I could see that still being the case to a certain degree in some social groups or large companies.<p>But the stripping down, deemphasis and normalization of the profile, turning it from a 'face book' into a social news tool was the inflection point for me. Facebook was great when you could surf people, not news. The funny thing is, Facebook was catalyzed tremendously by their decision to go into social news (i.e. news posted by people you know), and it'd be weird to see it causing their downfall (like a huge investment that looks great at first).<p>I doubt that's going to be the case, as the social graph infiltrates through the internet and 'like' buttons show up on every e-commerce site in innovative ways. I don't think Facebook truly has much to worry about as they're basically becoming the ID gatekeeper to the internet. I just don't think social news is something particularly interesting, and I'd like to see them deemphasize that part of their business. I think they should focus on making the news feed less of a potpourri of news (Twitter, HN, microforums, NY times, CNN, and so on own that already) and try to innovate ways to emphasize microcommunities on Facebook. The groups feature was an attempt, but didn't really strike gold. I'd like to see them try out more things like that.<p>I could be way off. I suspect Facebook is just losing touch with nerdy people who are more interested in things, not people. It's probably doing well with people who generally like smalltalk.",1301702307

For example, how many developers are members of mailing lists for a given API, service, language, tool, etc.?  How many contribute?    Plus, that doesn't even include the world of personal blogs, twitter accounts, etc.<p>I think we're entering an age for software engineers where expressing yourself externally is going to be even more important than your resume.  For example, a really intelligent, well-thought-out post like the one linked above can really move you forward in your career.<p>I'm focusing on making a startup that captures all this stuff and uses it for both display and matching candidates.

2398613,comment,2398238,2398371,3,0,originalgeek,,,"And that is how most of my interactions with Craigslist have gone off.<p>However, there have been some more frustrating experiences.  My friend getting his ad ghosted, when he was trying to post his mom's guest house for rent.  And it costing them 3 months of rent because Craigslist didn't let on a peep that his ad was ghosted.  And there really isn't any clue on how to find help, I got lucky and found the forums via a Google search for something like ""Craigslist ad not showing up"".  Then there was the merry-go-round of pathetic employees I was trying to hire for the unskilled jobs in my warehouse.  But that was back in 2008, before the bubble burst.  The quality of the applicants I found in my more recent go at it was greatly improved.  But the frustration now was 300 resumes showing up in my inbox in 12 hours, and sifting that down to 10 people to interview  I guess I should not complain about that, it is a little frustrating though.<p>The bottom line is Craigslist will always be around because it works, and it works anywhere.  There isn't any limited deployment like some of these startups that are piloting in 2 cities.  And probably won't go nationwide for a long time, if at all.  From what I read here on HN, the name of the game is for the startups to make the big sale and founders glide away on their golden parachutes, then the buyer crashes the company into the ground.",1301702056

Naturally, we searched the net for some cool open-source webcam projects, but with the exception of 1 product that would have cost us over $5,000, we found nothing that suit our needs.<p>So, we decided to create OpenBooth - a fully customizable Photobooth Flash application. Check it out, and feel free to use it in your own site!<p>GitHub Project URL: <a href=""http://github.com/obsesh/openbooth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/obsesh/openbooth</a>",1301699369

The Facebook codebase was and is enormous, so the vast majority of PHP has to work as advertised. The one big thing that's ruled out is eval, but other wacky PHP tricks ($f(), $C::staticMethod, $obj->$methodName(), foreach order, etc.) work. Outside of eval, you have to go out of your way to break it.<p>That said, it's a young project, and things can be a bit rocky. Including compilation in your deployment process is also a pain; do not kid yourself about that. It's kind of ""industrial strength"" in general; unless you care about how many PHP requests you can squeeze out of a unit of hardware, HipHop doesn't have much to offer.",1301699030

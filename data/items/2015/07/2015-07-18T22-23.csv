Having built similar systems before, the main reason why you would not simply run a function every time your input is updated is that you often need for your computations to keep a certain amount of state, which may depend on the input. However, as Incremental does not seem to support much in the way of stateful computations, I&#x27;m a bit puzzled wrt to what problem it addresses.",1437260283

In addition to everyone being careful not to be the guy who takes too much vacation (oh, except the slackers, of course), the value of an individual vacation day drops in everyone&#x27;s eyes (no scarcity) and the result is that management develops an attitude that it&#x27;s more acceptable to veto specific vacation dates.

It presents an interesting viewpoint on the benefits of passing judgement in domestic abuse situations. I think that &quot;passing judgment&quot; is a misleading description of what he is doing. A perhaps better one would be &quot;encouraging victims to take control of their lives&quot;.<p>The author has found that, in his experience, some (maybe many) victims of continued domestic abuse stay with their abusers because they simply continue doing what they&#x27;ve always done. Or perhaps the abuser &quot;needs them&quot; in some capacity. So the authors solution is to encourage and explain to victims that they can choose a different path in life and that their abusers may in fact not need them at all. It seems the author believes that a lack of self interest can be a contributing factor in continued abuse and that the solution is to increase the victims sense of self-worth and self-determination.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that this solution will always be beneficial. Or that domestic abuse is in some way the victim&#x27;s fault but the author does present an interesting argument for the benefit of asking the question &quot;what do you get out of this relationship?&quot; And has, at least anecdotally, found some positive results from doing so.",1437260119

It&#x27;s <i>brain-hacking</i>, where advertisers have figured out over decades of experience, and research into human cognitive biases and failure modes, ways of presenting the same product, the same information, but getting a desired response out of the target.<p>We accept this as a society because we tell ourselves that, as rational human beings, we have the choice to listen to or reject these messages. But modern understandings of cognitive biases show how advertising works on deeper levels, and even works despite us knowing about the tricks that are being used on us.<p>The problem is that there&#x27;s a severe imbalance. Advertisers are getting better and better at attacking -- at figuring out precisely what makes us tick, down to the level of pixels on an A/B-tested website.<p>Are people getting any better at defending themselves?

You are essentially mitigating the severity of the problem the article describes by saying that, really, advertis[ers|ments] are not _totally_ effective in stealing all of our attention.  We can probably tune it out, sometimes.  Usually we can mostly tune it out.  For now.<p>This is such a pernicious idea.  I suppose it can occur because this whole advertising thing has been one giant boiling the frog endeavor -- the fact that in some places you cannot engage in public life without turning over your attention, and all the statistical learning that occurs with it, to some entity over which you have no control.  Well, other than the trivial &quot;just stay in your house&quot; control, which I don&#x27;t feel to be control in any meaningful way.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the solution proposed to this is to assert property rights over something that, like clean air, people will probably have an intrinsic reaction to framing as property.  In other words, a tragedy of the commons defense against something that is, in some ways, the opposite of the commons: the right to engage in civic behavior and still be gatekeeper of your own attention.  Although maybe you could say it&#x27;s the attentional commons, as if we all shared the same attentional pasture.<p>Attention is one of those things where it seems to me the sci-fi future is closer than we imagine -- where you walk along a street, and, based on who some company things you are, helpful product info gets beamed into your brain.

Current &quot;&#x27;Silicon $foo&#x27; where $foo != &#x27;Valley&#x27;&quot; type cities (St. Louis, Austin, etc) may be a good bet too.</i><p>Interesting theory. (Let me add Minneapolis to your list.) The Midwest gets a lot of bad press on the Coasts (&quot;flyover country&quot;) but what&#x27;s missed is that if you control for urban-versus-rural or for density, it&#x27;s probably the most educated and liberal part of the country (perhaps tied with the Pacific Northwest). The East Coast, for example, isn&#x27;t notably cultured (to any degree that&#x27;s hard to find in other parts of the country) outside of certain neighborhoods in Boston or New York (which are getting expensive and inaccessible anyway).<p>The real cultural tension in the U.S. isn&#x27;t South vs. North or &quot;Red States&quot; versus &quot;Blue States&quot;. You might call it &quot;urban versus rural&quot;, but there are so few farmers (and most farmers I know are actually quite educated; you have to be smart to compete with agricorps) that it&#x27;s more of an urban versus suburb dichotomy (with the distinction depending more on lifestyle and outlook than whether the location is technically part of the incorporated city).<p>So yes, I agree. I don&#x27;t know that we need more talent coming into the Midwest (although it won&#x27;t hurt); we just need to stop losing the talent that we have to the Bay Area (where young engineers are still paid better after adjusting for cost-of-living; once you get older, the Midwest starts to win because it&#x27;s more like 140k vs. 170k than 70k vs. 120k). Obviously, most of those talented people don&#x27;t <i>stay</i> in the Bay Area (they get older, need space for families) but there isn&#x27;t a clear &quot;next&quot; destination for them. Do they go to Seattle? Chicago? Portland? Austin? Somewhere else? Perhaps this is a good thing, though, because it&#x27;s probably better for the country to have talent spread around than to try to replicate an aberration (SV&#x27;s concentration of economic activity, which congests it and deprives the rest of the country).",1437258904

9909181,comment,9908755,9908755,0,0,MaxScheiber,,,"This article has quite a cynical tone that I can&#x27;t say I agree with. The argument that advertising is the business of harvesting customers&#x27; attention, while not necessarily incorrect, is disingenuous. The ad industry is not some diabolical entity that conspires to brainwash citizens of the world.<p>I would posit that the advertising market is actually quite efficient as opposed to being a market failure. Let&#x27;s examine a paragraph from the market failure section:<p>> Movie theatres, cable channels, phone apps, bill-board operators, and so on price the sale of your attention at what it takes to extract it from you - namely, how easy it is for you to escape their predations. This is often much lower than the value to you, or to others, of directing your attention to something else.<p>The author makes the implicit assumption that advertisements automatically garner 100% of our attention. They don&#x27;t. When was the last time you went to a movie theater before the previews started, sat silently, and stared at the advert loop? You probably have never done that! Instead, you give your attention to your loved ones or your phone. And maybe you&#x27;ll watch the previews, but if you&#x27;re even somewhat into watching newly released movies, those add value to you.<p>Some advertisements <i>do</i> capture our attention, and those are priced appropriately. Super Bowl commercials cost more on a CPM basis than a commercial to be aired during the Walking Dead, which in turn costs more than an Instagram sponsored story. This is the sign of an efficient market, not a market failure.<p>Moreover, people do avoid advertisements when they deem it necessary. Some people buy the premium versions of iPhone applications, some people only watch new TV shows on Netflix, and some people pay extra to watch live sports events on an ad-free Internet stream. Again, this is the sign of an efficient market, not a market failure.<p>You could, instead, possibly make the argument that advertising is a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Perhaps the world would be better off without advertising. (I&#x27;m not even sure that this is true, given that advertising does benefit people.) But if there are no advertisements and a single company ran a TV spot, it would be at a huge competitive advantage. So everyone runs marketing campaigns. I really think this benefits the consumer more than the author gives credit for, however. Marketing is the field of creating value for a specific segment of the population, who in turn will enter into a long-term relationship with your firm and give you economic value in return. Advertising is an important part of this.<p>Also, to be clear, I don&#x27;t advocate for marketing strategies that themselves are disingenuous. Moreover, there are perfectly valid arguments to make that inference-based advertising are immoral, or that Internet tracking is immoral. But the author is painting with absolutely massive brush strokes against the entire field of &quot;advertising,&quot; and I feel the need to strongly qualify his argument.<p>There&#x27;s a lot I want to say about this piece, because it seems that the author fundamentally misunderstands marketing. The entire bit about advertisers charging consumers directly is a terrible business idea, for example, for the same reason that we have grocery stores and shopping malls. However, I don&#x27;t really want to spend all afternoon on a point-by-point response.",1437258023

Basic research discovers things that normal iterative research never does. And space tech discovers things through scale, overcoming myopic outlooks in the way an Access database doesn&#x27;t illuminate how distributed multi-region databases scale.<p>For example, what do you do with all that captured coal dust and slag we get from power plants scrubbing their exhaust? We <i>could</i> throw it away, but it turns out there are industries that would love to pay to take that garbage away and use it as a filler their process. We could have stuck with the argument that scrubbing is too expensive to be worth the trouble, and that it would never be practical. Or we can just do the engineering and try it out, and maybe new markets open up. Or not; at least we got some cleaner air.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of risk, like any venture. Possibly garbage is just garbage. Possibly there&#x27;s no reasonable return on investment. Possibly entire industrial supply chains shift to a new technology for the marginal improvement. Possibly a new process for extracting carbon nanotubes is discovered. Or we simply find a cool new color of black for our sports cars.<p>Maybe the data collected from the moon tells us that it&#x27;s really just some fairly boring rock not worth our time. Maybe we learn that crystals grown in space can have a perfect crystal structure useful in manufacturing stable q-bits. Maybe we find an asteroid made of platinum and all energy markets brace for a massive tech change, or parhaps it&#x27;s made of iron and we move on. Or... not; at least we got some pictures for the philosophers and the next generation is inspired to try harder.<p>The wins from basic research come from the unknown unknowns, and as such can be disruptive like an outside-context-problem [0]. Or are trivial duds; you can&#x27;t tell at the start, but you can hope. Transistors and lasers are pretty useful! They alone are likely worth all the money we&#x27;ve ever thrown (or ever will) at basic research. Likewise satellites also changed the world, allowing us to do things that likely make all the money we spend on space easily worth it.<p><insert some comment about Y Combinator startups maybe becoming billion dollar enterprises... but many fail.><p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Prob...</a>",1437256854

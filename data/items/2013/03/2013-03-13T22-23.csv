The risk (and the value of the experimental results) would probably be higher if he had found a way to isolate the compounds in the drink so he could enumerate the exact chemical composition.<p>If there is a risk, it is that his diet is potentially more homogenous than a typical diet, and doesn't include anything from some class of foods that nearly everyone on a more heterogeneous diet eats occasionally.",1363215533

5371663,comment,5365096,5370987,1,0,smosher,,,"> <i>but that implies a movement away from stock standard core</i> [...] <i>never</i> [etc.]<p>I wouldn't have said anything if I didn't disagree very strongly with these sentiments (see below about growing your own CSP/etc, and later about Coro in particular.) But first, about Node: let's <i>not</i> look at Node (unless you really want to, but as long as you understand it has nothing to do with my comment.) Problems with JS are usually founded on people complaining they don't like callbacks (translation: ""Go is better because I like it better""in which case please dispense with the cognitive dissonance and just be honest and say as much) and are inapplicable to other most other languages regardless.<p>Edit: That's not necessarily directed specifically at you, but people often vilify every aspect of things they don't like. I'm not convinced that's what you're trying to say about JS.<p>I don't view concurrency as this mysterious thing, if you know CSP you can write it in any language, usually fairly naturally. In languages like JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, you can even make it look like it was already part of the language, tucking away calls to the scheduler so the user doesn't need to write them explicitly (heck, you can do <i>that</i> part in C... but... don't), like in Go (save for pure-computation loops, also just like in Go.) All Go really does over the general case is adding implicit calls to the scheduler (not nicely possible in some languages) and treats the scheduler as a second-class primitive feature.<p>To go on about a unified implementation reaches my ears much like an argument that you'd better use `for` loops and never `map`s (guess what you can't do in Go.)<p>I wasn't going to bring this up, but since you're familiar with Perl you will be less likely to assume limitations. The lib is Coro. People do use it, but it is controversial because of #dramaintheperlcommunity (#whatelseisnews.) I don't know how popular it is overall, but if popularity is an issue for you let me know because it's a stupid argument to get into and I don't want to have it without realizing it. People rarely pay attention to concurrency anyway, but it's been around forever.<p>It is <i>not</i> a parallel library, for which I am thankful. (It's not incompatible with parallelism, and importantly: it doesn't make Go's mistakes in that area.) It amounts to a scheduler, facilities for spawning coroutines, wrappers to make calling the scheduler implicit (eg. at IO points), do async IO and every single thing you would need to make Perl automatically do the things Go automatically does. It will look exactly like Perl with Go's concurrency model, in broad strokes you do the same things, in the fine details you use Perl modules and methods and a new keyword or two.",1363215418

It created a new special second-class ""tainted"" designation for content sites that refused to play ball with rightsholders and gave rightsholders new means to prosecute their rights outside of civil courts. It was understandable and --- even though I'm a supporter of copyright in general --- commendable that organized opposition to SOPA killed that bill outright.<p>CISPA is nothing like SOPA.<p>To begin with, CISPA has none of the same objectives of SOPA. It isn't about the content industry at all. In fact, when early opposition to CISPA by organizations like EFF started catching on, its sponsors scrubbed the bill of language that could have been read (in a stretch) as protecting rightsholders. CISPA is about online security attacks, not about piracy.<p>Next, CISPA isn't invasive. SOPA threatened to create a kangaroo court system of copyright-noncompliant sites that the content industry could starve by banning commercial transactions with them. CISPA is an opt-i bill; the USG cannot compel any organization to cooperate with any USG agency, but instead creates a facility that companies can use if they need to share attack information but don't want to spend $100,000 in ECPA-interpreting legal review each time they do it.<p>In fact, CISPA in practice probably has more to do with information moving FROM the USG TO private companies. The USG spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year monitoring its networks (which together constitute the largest IT organization in the world). It is true that the largest IT org in the world happens to be a shitty IT shop, but it has nevertheless built up about a decade of experience tracking malware and botnets and DOS attack information; when Blaster broke out, the experience of the Naval Marine Corp Intranet getting overrun by it was some of the first shared among ISPs. All sorts of random rules prevent USG IT shops from running any kind of central clearinghouse of attack information, and still more rules prevent any of that information from being published.<p>I don't particularly like CISPA. It obviously sounds like I do, but that's because the uninformed paranoia about CISPA is so virulent that any measured take on the bill sounds like cheerleading. I don't care whether CISPA passes or doesn't pass. But it drives me a little bananas to see how easily the ostensibly curious and well-informed people on HN are bamboozled by identity politics on issues like this.<p>It's a tiny bill, as bills go.

It's hard to say what the exact reason is - paralyzing conservatism, business models built on <i>decommoditizing</i> money into an identity-based instrument, conspiracy via government regulation, or something else. But enough time has passed that if banks were remotely receptive to the idea of digital cash, it would have caught on <i>somewhere</i>.<p>> <i>there is nothing in Bitcoin that can ""reissue"" currency</i><p>Every new wallet address, no? Offline transactions are vulnerable to double spends, but this is the case with every digital cash system. IIRC, the ones that protect against offline double spends do so by revealing the fraudster's identity if a token is spent twice - requiring a bank and legal system for recourse.<p>> <i>It is more common to assume some bound on the attacker's computing power and to use complexity theoretic arguments about security.</i><p>Sure, and this is what the SHA2/DSA parts of Bitcoin do. Nobody can forge transactions, the worry comes about from double-spending. You have to remember, digital currency is <i>not</i> a two-party problem - every involved party is what gives the currency value. This is essentially a coordination problem (which database copy is authoritative?), and is precisely the novel problem that Bitcoin <i>solved</i>. Previous p2p attempts would do something like ""majority of parties"", which is always vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Bitcoin went for something that <i>can</i> be algorithmically enforced, staking its outcome on the belief that NSA-level computing would both not dwarf the rest of the network, and that double spends would be detected and could be somehow mitigated down the line.",1363214227

Most of the end goals of scientific research are humanist; for example, in biomedical science, the major end goal is to cure human disease (I'm sure that some physicists will disagree with this claim, but if they like getting public funding for their research, they at the very least are good at convincing others that they have humanist end goals). When a field of study is complex enough, a scientist must develop a way to prioritize what to study. In biomedical science, this often means that scientists choose particular areas of focus based around the area's likelihood of being implicated in disease.  Choosing the right area of study is not inherently scientific, but will nonetheless have a huge impact on how others view a scientist's skill. Likewise, understanding the anthropological sub-context of another scientist's work provides an advantage in understanding the impact of that work.<p>This is what I think Ted meant when he claimed that science is anthropological at the margins. While what we publish in journals is definitely science, the path to get to the bottom line takes something more, and being able to understand what that was in other people's work and use it in your own ultimately makes you a better scientist.  The difference between us and pseudoscientists such as Creationists is that our results are predictable, repeatable, and understood mechanistically once we are done, but this does not mean that there isn't an anthropological nature to what we do.",1363213895

It's exciting to see investors seeking ""real-world"" opportunities in important areas, which aligns well with our long-tail world view.<p>However it's currently a little early for us to get sidetracked here. We'd like to see ?investor? show a few more exits and demonstrate a more complete core understanding of our market. We've offered to introduce him to a few value-add founders within our network, who we think could really help him work through and grasp some of the technological issues fundamental to achieving a product/market fit in our industry. We plan on keeping in close touch and will be iterating back once he's at a more appropriate point to deserve equity from those who have worked so hard.<p>On a separate note, I feel like we could be doing more to help YC groupies. We're amazed at what people want to throw money at and we'd love to grab a coffee and talk more about how we could help investors better understand the opportunities we've poured so much of our hearts and souls into.<p>Best,<p>edw519",1363212575

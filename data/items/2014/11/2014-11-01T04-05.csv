But I&#x27;m also guessing that el goog has an automated system to notice the patterns.<p>Ranting, but to this day, I still can&#x27;t use google search reliably over TOR, meanwhile the spammers and adversarial people who scour Google&#x27;s results for whatever purpose have almost certainly hacked the captcha, otherwise they would stop their grokking of the SERPs and rethink their retrieval methods, like get a channel bank of dial up modems, redialing once they get to a captcha. On certain TOR exits there is no captcha, so I assume they&#x27;re probably new nodes or light traffic nodes. The captcha block page even says this: your computer is sending us a lot of queries. Here&#x27;s one such unblocked node. It&#x27;s in the ukraine, ~10MBPS, uptime of 31 days. It&#x27;s about middle of the road in terms of bandwidth and has a somewhat short uptime.

8542235,comment,8541424,8541739,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Also I think if society would have tolerated alcohol prohibition that the government would have been happy to keep that going as well for similar reasons.<p>See my comment here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542155"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542155</a>. In fact, at the time prohibition was proposed, alcohol taxes made up fully 1/3 of federal revenue. The money and moneyed interests were aligned against prohibition, not for it.<p>I think a lot of people look for ways to get around the fact that when you give people self-determination as a group, they might vote for things you don&#x27;t like with no nefarious undertones in play. The simplest explanation is this one: I don&#x27;t vote, my mom does. There are more puritanical people who simply don&#x27;t want to live in a society that condones drug use than the opposite. It&#x27;s just like how when people in arab countries got the opportunity to vote, they voted-in conservative Islamic governments. Sure they are opportunists taking advantage of those tendencies, but at the end of the day, you have to grapple with the real fact that people have ideas about what their societies should look like, and democracy means that they get to carry those ideas into fruition.",1414817868

8542220,comment,8539596,8540695,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I recently did some research on exactly this topic.<p>What I discovered is that the pay gap for people doing the same/similar job with the same level of experience and working the same hours is fairly small if it exists at all.  Different studies measure it as between 0 and 7 percent &quot;unexplained&quot; pay gap (ie, not a result of degree, experience, hours worked, or other legitimate differences.)  And it&#x27;s not like these were all right-wing studies; some were coming from left-wing women&#x27;s labor organizations and still saying they couldn&#x27;t detect a wage gap after controlling for the relevant factors.<p>The one &quot;counterexample&quot; someone tried to post for me was about freshly hired women in medicine, who make less than freshly hired men in virtually every medical specialty -- but the study they cherry-picked data from actually discussed how the pay gap between men and women in the same specialty had widened recently, specifically because women were negotiating more non-salary perks (like family-friendly hours) in exchange for lower salary.<p>The actual amount of proveable wage discrimination in the US is very small -- I was looking at labor department statistics, and the total for discrimination settlements was measured in millions (in an economy measured in trillions).  This included both out of court settlements and court-mandated settlements.<p>I don&#x27;t deny that some wage discrimination exists.  But the data suggests it&#x27;s not nearly as widespread or systematic as commonly believed.  (And IMO it&#x27;s self-evident that it&#x27;s not -- because if it was, the economic opportunity for companies paying women fairly would be staggering.  They could get the cream of the crop of women for average male salaries.)",1414817258

At the time, alcohol manufacturers had tremendous political power, and excise taxes on alcohol made up about 1/3 of federal revenue. What made prohibition pass legislatures around the country was a concerted effort by devoted constituencies: Christians and women. Indeed, one of the primary drivers of women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States was prohibition--alcohol was seen by many leading suffragists as being at the root of social ills like domestic violence.<p>One of the most interesting charts I&#x27;ve seen with regards to the modern drug war is this one: <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/majority-now-supports-legalizing-marijuana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/majority-now-supports...</a>. My recollection of childhood, of school assemblies with adults shrieking &quot;Just Say No!&quot; wasn&#x27;t wrong. When I was a kid in the early 1990&#x27;s, the popular position was in favor of keeping marijuana illegal by an almost 80-20 margin. This is a country that couldn&#x27;t agree on anything (in 1992, they voted for Bill Clinton over George Bush by a 43-37 margin), yet they almost all agreed that marijuana (we&#x27;re not even talking about harder drugs) should be illegal.",1414814852

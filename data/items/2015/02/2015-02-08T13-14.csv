Carpenters with &quot;fifteen years of experience&quot;  would talk about how they haven&#x27;t made a single I-joist since they were an apprentice.  If they ever needed to make a &quot;California Corner&quot;, they&#x27;d just look it up on YouTube and it&#x27;s pointless to expect them to know it off the top of their head.<p>They&#x27;d then explain that what you really should be asking in the interview is a series of questions about the specific wavelengths of light reflected by different brands of brown paint, because painting things brown is 95% of what a carpenter does and the rest is just wood-gluing together prefab parts from the factory.",1423403967

9017235,comment,9017027,9017027,0,0,belorn,,,"A clear difference between a carpenter and a programmer is the liability inherent in the work. A carpenter can&#x27;t just produce a minimum viable product that just happens to break down as soon as a bird land on it, or leaks water as if it was constructed like a sieve. Hiring a carpenter is a comparable safe thing to do, as the worst thing a lawful carpenter can do is overcharge his clients/employer.<p>A programmer on other hand is not liable for anything. If it breaks or leaks information at the easiest provocation, then its not the programmer who might loose money. All risk is put on the employer or customer, and as such, it becomes their responsibility to identify and test a programmer before spending money. As a result, you get questions which are mostly irrelevant to the task at hand, but which might sorts out high risk vs low risk.<p>If I hired a carpenter under those conditions, I would ask what brand of paint they buy. If its an expensive one, it might hint towards a professional.",1423403186

The closest analogy I can think of is those religious people who say “God is just another word for the order and beauty in the Universe” – and then later pray to God to smite their enemies. And if you criticize them for doing the latter, they say “But God just means there is order and beauty in the universe, surely you’re not objecting to that?”<p>>The result is that people can accuse people of “privilege” or “mansplaining” no matter what they do, and then when people criticize the concept of “privilege” they retreat back to “but ‘privilege’ just means you’re interrupting women in a women-only safe space. Surely no one can object to criticizing people who do that?”<p>>…even though I get accused of “privilege” for writing things on my blog, even though there’s no possible way that could be “interrupting” or “in a women only safe space”.<p>>When you bring this up, people just deny they’re doing it and call you paranoid.<p>>When you record examples of yourself and others getting accused of privilege or mansplaining, and show people the list, and point out that exactly zero percent of them are anything remotely related to “interrupting women in a women-only safe space” and one hundred percent are “making a correct argument that somebody wants to shut down”, then your interlocutor can just say “You’re deliberately only engaging with straw-man feminists who don’t represent the strongest part of the movement, you can’t hold me responsible for what they do” and continue to insist that anyone who is upset by the uses of the word “privilege” just doesn’t understand that it’s wrong to interrupt women in safe spaces.<p>>I have yet to find a good way around this tactic.",1423403086

I reminded me a lot of this Youtube video(<a href=""http://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg</a>).<p>I understand this is a comical post but as the son of a carpenter and understanding the profession decently well I would say these are none of the questions that would be asked of a carpenter.<p>There are however many important questions a person would need to answer to be hired as a carpenter or more likely be able to join a union. There they would be able to get experience and training. Then the company the union carpenter work for already knows the skills and abilities they have and there is really no need for any interview. Any GC or sub asks for guys to do a job. The local sends them the qualified guys. Pretty simple actually.",1423401963

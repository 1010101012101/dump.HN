9207586,comment,9203510,9207377,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"You make a very good point. I do like to give you one additional aspect to consider: While the Mill saves on instruction scheduling logic (and register renaming, and certainly also has the benefit of re-thinking opcodes and instruction decode), there are other features that add complexity again. Making a subroutine call appear as if it were a single instruction has got to be tricky, for example.<p>In the end, I have only seen CPU design from a physical design tool support point of view. I don&#x27;t really have the necessary experience to judge the relative complexity of out-of-order+register renaming vs. whatever the Mill aims to do. You&#x27;re probably right that the Mill is simpler.<p>Part of it is that all we really know about all this comes from a bunch of talks that focus on what the Mill looks like to the user. Who knows what their physical design story is. I just hope, for their own sake, that they have been working on that part of it for a significant amount of time as well.",1426445944

Frankly, Evernote has been at it for 7 years and spent $225M on the problem, and they have done a pretty damn great job at it.<p>I&#x27;ve asked myself WHY do I want to host my own data. My innermost thoughts are hard to imagine being broadcast to the NSA, Chinese government, and any ambitious cracker... but what I write about I will eventually publish anyhow. And the projects I am working on will eventually be free software anyhow. AND even with my own infrastructure I know that the NSA/Chinese/Crackers could find a way in.<p>I gave up on giving up on the cloud. From one perspective, I think that security through obscurity (with 7 Billion folks, why does my stuff matter THAT much?) is a thing. Another thing is that if my work were discovered, what would happen? Controversy? Notoriety? As a marketer I crave those things.<p>I have some very patentable, valuable work sitting in Evernote, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, various local and hosted Owncloud/NeverNote/Laverna/LibreOffice files. My plan is to get as much as I can of it into Evernote and move on with my work rather than spending more time on this question.<p>Ultimately I had to ask myself this: If I am going to ask even one person to trust my service with their data, why can&#x27;t others ask the same of me?<p>FYI, Here is what my Evernotes are about: I think that the future of computing should be based on Canonical Identity via Blockchain, &#x27;personal fact clouds&#x27; for every identity that store state in infinispan grids (most will use hybrid clouds, but could be fully self hosted on an RPi in a fanny pack), datamic+datalog for interfacing with the data, and infinite user and machine interfaces to that data. I think that CoreOS/Ubuntu Core could be the foundation for personal grid computing, every app can be a container with on demand scaling and failover, and that data transport can be equally at home on a sneakernet, the internet of today, or the mesh network of tomorrow. I believe that data is soveign, sharing of that data should always be FINITE, all user interfaces should be stateless, and hardware should allow for users to compose their own interfaces. In this future, VR and IOT are instantly integrated, everybody owns their own data, and short of physical access data isn&#x27;t shared ever ever ever unless with finite permission.<p>I&#x27;m using Evernote for now because it is fast and lets me work on my work. And now that y&#x27;all have my ideas to steal, do. Please. Let&#x27;s build a better world together, eh?<p>Being open rarely closes doors.",1426445553

Unfortunately the &#x27;Hacker Way&#x27; is to glue components together and declare success if the whole thing &#x27;works&#x27;. The glue is normally a scripting language of some sort, and the pieces can be enormously powerful, such as an EC2 cluster or an IP messaging framework.<p>There was a study a while back called &#x27;The Cloud Begins With Coal&#x27;. While some may dispute the specifics, the main point is this- computation requires energy. When you integrate components without regard for how much energy is required to exercise them, you can end up with an enormous and inefficient or dangerous system.<p>Consider Facebook, a case study of the dangerous effects of a hacker system coupled with large amounts of money. They have built an enormous computational infrastructure to automate the task of sharing pictures over a network. Thousands of engineers and large amounts of electricity are being consumed to execute a process that has no clear social benefit, and for which few of the &#x27;customers&#x27; would be willing to pay, other than the surveillance agencies.<p>Why is that? I propose it is due to non-systems thinking, nobody sat down at the beginning to engineer the end-to-end process (much less the business model). A properly engineered system would require a central piece of telecom equipment, say a typical Ericsson switch, and a git-like protocol that stored content on the client side. Boom, no data center required.<p>Somebody a few days ago demonstrated the ability to delete arbitrary content from the Facebook data center using a Raspberry Pi. Hacker vs. Hacker.<p>Another example of hacker culture is the NSA - nobody there thought of the world as a complete system, they just hacked together a whole slew of tools to accomplish one part of their mission (SIGINT) without regard for their ultimate customer, the American people.<p>We need to declare hacker culture a clear and present danger to society.",1426445011

College applications work exactly the same way – top schools could fill their classes with 2400 SAT, 4.0 GPA, Porsche-driving philanthropist-of-the-year white or Asian males year after year. But frankly, that school would suck.<p>A better approach would be to focus on the group. Metrics like: how enjoyable the hackathon was, what cool people did you meet, what did you learn from fellow hackers, and ultimately: how many quality submissions were created. This is ignoring any explicit goals of increasing diversity/inclusion in the field, which is a fairly common theme for hackathons.<p>One can rightly argue that increasing the diversity of their participants falls well in line with their entire purpose of existing.

This too is function, and it&#x27;s something that immediately grates when you go to Windows from Mac.<p>What you are doing is praising Windows for letting you operate things by keyboard that are normally designed to be operated by a mouse, such as that &quot;context menu&quot; key they added to keyboards and which practically no-one uses on purpose. This is something that Apple minimizes by default, but which you can enable through accessibility settings and such. The fact that many Windows users expect this to be turned on by default has lead them to conclude that Macs can only be operated by a mouse.<p>Furthermore, &quot;form over function&quot; is what a lot of Windows UI looks like to me. On a Mac, a file icon in a window&#x27;s titlebar is still a full reference to the file, and you can drag it out and do things with it. A file downloaded in Safari has a progressbar on its icon, and you can copy it to a different machine and open it to resume. The Windows equivalents of these things are just dead icons and broken file type associations.<p>The two OS&#x27;es have a radically different philosophy. But personally, I can&#x27;t use Windows anymore once I realized how dumb &quot;Ok&quot; &quot;Cancel&quot; &quot;Apply&quot; is, as opposed to just being able to tick off a checkbox on/off and seeing the entire UI update immediately.",1426443840

But now that my subconscious has had a day to chew on things, I think I don&#x27;t agree quite as much.<p>The really interesting thing about the Mill is that it does away with a HUGE portion of what a CPU does: out-of-order execution (OOE).  These days the amount of die space that&#x27;s dedicated to reordering and dependency checking and the commit engine is substantial, and that stuff really slows a processor down because the thing that are happening at the end of the pipeline depend on what&#x27;s happening at the beginning.  At 4GHz the best-case scenario the wavelength is 75mm, and the 1/4 wavelength is thus 19mm, on the order of the size of the die!<p>What the Mill does is push the reordering and dependency checking to the compiler so that the hardware itself is &quot;dumb&quot; at least insofar as not doing all the checking for OOE and multiple dispatch, etc.  Further since the instructions are ordered as blocks and that blocking is done by the compiler, the processor doesn&#x27;t even need any logic to assign instructions to functional units; that&#x27;s done at compile time.<p>I agree that fast and power efficient silicon is a challenge, but again because they&#x27;re not mixing execution with reasoning about execution (OOE, multiple dispatch, commit engine, etc) it&#x27;s much, much easier to make the layout fast.  I believe that instructions and data will flow through the Mill in a way that makes regular CPU architects envious.<p>I still suspect that a huge amount of the delay is due largely to the general weirdness of the architecture; it&#x27;s not like an x86 to ARM port because those have a lot of the same basic assumptions baked in and the only difference is the instruction and data encoding.  On the Mill few of the assumptions are the same and so you might have to re-write a LOT of code to boot a Linux kernel.",1426442921

The useful knowledge is not the specific implementation details of the algorithm, but the ability to look at a real problem and realize &#x27;this is like looking for the longest matching substring&#x27; or &#x27;this is similar to finding a convex hull&#x27;. Then you can go and try to find the best way to implement a convex hull calculation in your particular circumstances. Just because you don&#x27;t know an optimal convex hull algorithm off the top of your head doesn&#x27;t tell me much.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for in asking somewhat algorithmic questions in an interview is the ability of the coder to reduce a problem to one which has probably already been solved. A separate but interesting problem is, given such a solution, how well can you implement it - but that&#x27;s more of a fizzbuzz exercise in many cases.",1426442452
9207351,comment,9206782,9207316,0,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"There is a difference between writing systems in an environment where you have a centralized flag parser and flag inheritance across google3, and shipping a binary to users who expect things to behave like getopt. Also, let&#x27;s be honest, flags in google3 are a nightmare. They are certainly well-engineered but lost any semblance of sanity a long time before you and me got there. The kernel patch springs to mind.<p>Having to rethink my entire career of something simple like &quot;how to pass flags to a binary&quot; had better bring significant improvement, and flag does not. flag regresses a lot of convention about the operator interface to a program. This:<p><pre><code>    binary -vexd data output
</code></pre>
Is encouraged by flag to become:<p><pre><code>    binary -verbose -extra -one-file-system -data-dir=data -output-dir=output
</code></pre>
I understand the argument for self-explanatory command lines but at the cost of unexpected (and far more verbose) behavior is a tough trade off. One thing I haven&#x27;t seen discussed is how &quot;required&quot; options are encouraged by flag because of how difficult positional arguments are. That&#x27;s in addition to everything in the article, which I agree with.<p>Python argparse gets this nearly perfect, subcommands and all. flag is near the top of what I hate about Go as an SRE. Java too.",1426442449

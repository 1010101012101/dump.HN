2720742,comment,2719448,2719561,3,0,bphogan,,,"I'd just like to see a little better documentation on this in the Backbone docs. The documentation you currently have says I'll need to alter the backend, but it's not exactly clear what the changes to the backend would need to be. Do I need to implement /new and /edit on my server to make Backbone's pushSate work, or do I need them implemented to provide for a graceful fallback? It's a little confusing as written so I had to just code something up to see what happened.",1309568534

The real important thing IMO is NTLM challenge/responses based on the hash, which unfortunately is not much better. In case of NTLMv1/MS-CHAP it is three 56-bit DES operations on separate parts of the 128-bit hash (the third being only 2^16 so it is easy to precompute, as shown by asleap). NTLMv2's HMAC-MD5 is fast too.",1309568495

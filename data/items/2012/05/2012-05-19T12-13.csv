Now that it's one of the few fields that are booming, they have to be in IT.<p>Also, did it ever strike you as slightly odd that there was never a woman speaking for herself who came forward and said something like, ""Geez, I really would have loved to study advanced algorithms, and functional programming, and later on work in Big Data."" The women seem perfectly content with their choices. It's only feminists (of both sexes) who think that they have to speak up for some allegedly silent majority of women who are kept out of technology for whatever reason. If they want to get into the field, they can acquire all the knowledge they want. It's available online, and for free. Let me tell you something: I am a man, and there never was a day when someone rang my door, shoved some programming tutorials into my face and told me, ""Go, and work through that."" No, instead I had to sit down and find my own sources, and people I could learn from. All of this is hard work.<p>Oh, and let me tell you another non-pc truth that is so unpalatable for you: technology and sciences are, even for most guys, not necessarily a ton of fun, and if we had the option of simply looking good and marrying a millionaire, we might be less inclined to go work hard as well.

I started out scared by the ""no conditionals, no loop constructs, no functions, no aliases"" - What I really needed was something confidence-building, like<p><pre><code>    ; for i in `{ns} {echo $i | sed 's/.* //'} | sort | uniq
</code></pre>
It looks familiar, and you can mostly puzzle it out without having to know a lot. More to the point, it looks like something you'd do every day. It's also a nice introduction to the `for` construct and it introduces a quoting syntax. ""Just enough rope to hang yourself."" No doubt we wouldn't guess that those braces are for lambdas, but that's easy enough to correct. Perhaps my complaint says more about me than you - I'm more than happy to `load std` before I even know what a module is, because all I really want to do is process some text. Similarly, I can appreciate conceptual cleanness in a language, but in a shell especially it's an ancillary benefit.<p>The short digression on escaping and quoting (`fourspaces` and all that) at the end of the ""Fetching Web Pages"" is lovely. Really, that's exactly what I was after - ""This is Bash and it's annoying, this is Inferno and it just works right."" It's succinct and it clearly shows that Inferno does better than the alternative (and when you're convincing someone to use your shell the argument is as much about Bourne and Bash as it is about your option.)",1337430393

3995770,comment,3994440,3994775,11,0,spindritf,,,"There are a couple of legitimate reasons why police officers might not want to be recorded 8-12 hours a day.<p>First is purely psychological. Would you want to have someone looking over your shoulder all the time? Would you want your employer to record everything you do on your computer through some spyware? Have a camera mounted above your head?<p>Second is procedural. There are so many rules and regulations that it's almost impossible not to break some of them (just like with laws in western countries) so police officers (just like citizens) rely on low detection rate for minor violations and difficulty of proving anything.<p>There is also something to be said about how trustworthy police officers would be everyone they come in contact while on duty. People (and that includes criminals) find it much easier to trust a person they see standing in front ot them than some unknown tape reviewer.<p>And finally, basic privacy. If you work for many hours with little to do (patrolling the streets isn't exactly a consuming task), you probably have a lot of personal conversations with your partners.<p>Those problems will also be made worse by the officers themselves struggling with yet another piece of equipment (have you ever seen a cop running?).<p>All or almost all of the above could probably be resolved with selective recording, clear indicators of when the camera is running, light and easy to use devices and other technical solutions. Though we all know that, as with any other technological project, first users will get a lot of leakage and other bugs. And with the feedback loops what they are in the government, many may not be fixed for a really long time.",1337429608

Hormones in adolescence are the clearest example to me.<p>But then, I used to think that ""Girls just don't like chess.""  It turns out that this very much depends on the age of the girls.  Why do numbers of male and female chess players start equal, and then drop off as people get older?  It's not related to skill either.<p>The BBC Radio Four 'popular statistics' programme ""More or Less"" has a short segment.

It's the ""just"" in ""most girls just don't like technology"" I object to, like it's an innate aversion against technology that can't be overcome.<p>""Another issue is, and this is a highly non-pc one, that the female IQ distribution doesn't reach the same highs (and lows) as male IQ distribution.""<p>Irrespective of being true or not, engineers, for example, would mostly be placed in the higher ranges. <i>If</i> any difference in the distribution of intelligence could account for the gender imbalance in technical occupations, the difference would be markedly less than would be expected from a potentially deviating IQ distribution.<p>Regarding ""brain differences: it's called spatio-relational reasoning.""<p>Seeing how there are, in absolute numbers, even if not in relative numbers, many women who excel in highly technical occupations and environments, this does not account for any differences, unless it could be shown that this particular subset of women have a different ""male spatio-relational reasoning"" part of the brain, as opposed to other women.<p>I do not agree or disagree that biology might have part in a difference in interest in technology in men and women. The point is to identify <i>which</i> part if any.
And even if it is ultimately shown that there are biological limits to technology adoption by women in the high ranges of (say) 75%, that still means there are 25% who might be persuaded to become involved in technology by a change in societal behaviour instead of being ""sucked into"" what at this time is a stereotypical profession for a gender.",1337429256

But you are right, there's always one or two ideas that keep nagging at me, and right now I'm pursuing an idea that although it wasn't mine, right now I simply cannot not put it aside.<p>My filter for writing it down is simply if an idea represents an actual problem that a real person is facing. In other words, I don't write down an idea that I simply think it's cool, but when I hear about someone facing a real problem.",1176612643

Gamma rays are rare. GRBs dump a lot of energy out at the same time; enough that we can get a spectrum. Given the observation date, it's easy to find that this was GRB 090510, which was a short burst of 0.33 seconds. It was detected by Fermi-LAT, so that gives somewhere under a degree of angular resolution.<p>Few gamma rays normally, huge numbers at once, from the same direction, means that few of huge numbers are going to be background, and likely means that those gamma rays came from the same source.<p>Still, it might be a coincidence, which is why the summary we both read includes the phrase ""There is a possibility of a statistical fluke, or that space-time foam interacts with light differently than we imagined,"" and mentions ""If future gamma-ray bursts confirm this.""<p>How did you not draw this same inference?",1357912799
5042649,comment,5040725,5040725,1,0,mrbill,,,"I bought one of the Catleap Q270s off eBay a few months ago and paid extra for a ""pixel perfect"" version.  Less than a week later it was on my porch, perfect condition, and no dead pixels that I've seen.  Screen is beautiful, and I hooked it to my Mac Mini with one of the Monoprice active dual-link DVI adapters.<p>I occasionally get ""snow"" coming back from sleep, but unplugging/replugging the DVI cable into the adapter fixes that, and it hasn't been enough of an annoyance to consider spending $100 on the Apple-brand adapter.<p>In all, I've been very, very happy with it - and will probably buy one of the Monoprice models when I upgrade another one of my systems.",1357912798
5042648,comment,5042184,5042397,1,0,sp4rki,,,"Because there is no competition. If you decide to build rocket launchers and the company you source, say the warheads for the rockets, starts sending you lemons (rockets without the high yield explosives you used to get for example), you start sourcing your warheads from someone else. Hell build you own and get on with it.<p>Now if a company patents a specific warhead that only they can make and you decide to make a rocket launcher that is made specifically to launch rockets with those warheads and no other warheads are compatible with your launcher and suddenly the source company decides that their warheads suck anyways, you just lost your business.<p>My Takarov can fire any type of 7.6225mm Takarov ammunition, albiet some is better than others.

5042643,comment,5042088,5042423,1,0,codebeaker,,,"The intention is to provide an API that requires little or no work on the part of the service relying on the data. Having had to work with thetvdb's API I can attest to having to download ~100 XML files (all languages) in order to determine if anything is new, their API is often 2/3 days out of date, some internal caching problems and problems with scaling, they only deliver XML, poorly compressed (owing to key structure).<p>I believe services such as trakt.tv and similar should be able to do one thing, and do it well, offer a to-do list of shows you should watch, and summarise what you have watched. And they shouldn't have to write thousands of lines of code to interface with an API for what's actually quite simple.<p>In my (admittedly contrived, and not representative) benchmarks the JSON representing a typical TV series is 76% smaller, and parses 56% faster (that is probably representative of years of research and work into making fast XML parsers, and JSON being a relatively young format)<p>Also, I find it strange that they don't provide a notifications API or changes stream.<p>I don't want to call thetvdb specifically, many API and data providers make the same mistakes, if one can call a missing feature a mistake. (TradeDoubler, many financial APIs, etc)<p>Another departure from typical API design is to accept that many movies, shows, books and so forth are provided simultaneously (or, close to simultaneously), world wide, in multiple languages.<p>Therefore any API that purports to represent them must acknowledge that English isn't the <i>default</i> language, but it may have been the language in which the media was authored, and that airing dates, shipping and printing dates are worthless without timezone and language information.<p>My goal is to make an API that is easy to use, and can open the creativity of the community up, by allowing something that is now rather difficult to become easy.<p>To call out some of the problems I've tried to solve: timezones; networks; outlets (web); airing dates vs. availability dates (locale specific); actors vs. hosts vs. cameos; returning series under the same name; specials vs. pilots vs. shows about a series; treating different languages with equal weight; encoding (utf-8 naturally); gzip; msgpack... I'm sure there are many more which I've forgotten, but that's the gist of it :-)",1357912728

5042638,comment,5042316,5042316,8,0,rauljara,,,"Very interesting.  This is kind of the opposite of the standard advice of ""don't repeat yourself"" and ""don't reinvent the wheel"".  Both those pieces of advice make an awful lot of sense to me.<p>But this is more advice in the style of an STD prevention campaign.  ""You aren't just sleeping with that gem, you're sleeping with every gem that gem ever slept with.""  Which, admittedly the blog author isn't taking quite to abstinence advocacy levels, but also rings kind of true.<p>Reimplementing basic stuff across projects probably also keeps up your programming chops.  The practice would help make the trivial stuff truly trivial for you.<p>But what worries me about this advice is that there are some things that feel like they're trivial to implement but actually have quite a few subtleties and gotchas.  In a language as dynamic as Ruby, you might even end up doing something awful (like letting your xml parser run arbitrary code).  If the subtle bugs are located in gems, you only need to fix the gem to fix it all.<p>But then again, how often do you own the gem?  Even it's open source and you can fork it, the whole point of a gem is encapsulation.  You shouldn't have to be thinking about its inner workings.  Some gems really can carry big risks with them.<p>I don't feel like I have answers to these questions right now.  Just worth thinking about.",1357912648

In his book <i>Object-Oriented Software Construction</i>, Bertrand Meyer explains how the language is developed to fit the OO paradigm. (I recognize though, that some of his arguments in favor of is own language are really ridiculously biased)\nAs far as I know, Eiffel's support for a truely usable and flexible multiple inheritance is unique among all programming languages, due to a clever renaming mechanism.<p>Sadly the language didn't gain much traction over the years (for reasons due to library support and lack of environments).\nWith the whole revival of functional (and hybrid) languages, I think that good old structured OOP as Bertrand Meyer envisioned will remain the realm of C++ for performance critical applications and C#, Java (and others) for more entreprisey stuff.",1357911254

Something might be risky (50% chance of failure) but at least you can calculate and reason about it. ""Uncertainty"" is ""worse"" because you can't easily reason about it. We often assign numbers to uncertain events anyway, but they might be off by several orders of magnitude.<p>He goes on to say something like: <i>Risk fuels capitalism and the marked, uncertainty grinds it to a halt</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver#Book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver#Book</a><p>Edit: I forgot to tie this in to what we where talking about :)\nAs I see it, relying on someone else (with out <i>any</i> guarantees) is not just risky but uncertain. You can't really know how likely it is that they will change down the road. Doesn't mean it can't work out though..",1357909735

Case in point, I don't think you can get Twitter handles from even first-tier connections any more. I made the appropriate API calls, waved my hands, and all I got were empty values. The docs do clearly state that you should be able to download every Twitter handle associated with an account, so WTH? It looks like they've revoked this functionality without changing the docs?<p>More broadly, it would be cool for a developer-oriented company to de-risk their API by adding some guarantees that they won't pull this kind of stuff. Right now developer agreements pretty well only restrict what the developer can do; adding conditions to limit how the interface can change would be a big selling point. The problem is, as long as VCs keep throwing money at companies that exist at the mercy of LinkedIn et al, there's no reason for them to. They get to open up the platform, watch for popular apps, then consume or copy them and lock down the API again to prevent competition.",1357909627

Python and Ruby are fantastic for shell scripting, but I've always found myself gravitating towards PHP for web application development -- but that's only a personal preference. I haven't done any client work with Node.js but I know I'd feel just as comfortable building a full web app in JavaScript.<p>At the same time, I've tried to use PHP and JavaScript for shell scripts and I just can't get it to sit right with me. PHP is just awkward (again, my preference) and Node's shell interaction is asynchronous which doesn't work well when trying to do things like build scripts.",1324004319

The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.</i><p><i>If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power, in its own nature illimitable.</i><p><i>Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void.</i><p><i>If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration.</i><p>IT IS EMPHATICALLY THE PROVINCE AND DUTY OF THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT TO SAY WHAT THE LAW IS. <i>Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.</i><p>--- 8< ---<p><i>You</i> can't look at the Constitution and declare that, for instance, Congress has no power to ""regulate"", as that isn't one of its enumerated powers. The authority to do that is vested with the Supreme Court. The track record of your underlying argument --- that Congress should keep its hands off X or Y or Z, because it has no enumerated power to tamper with it --- is not encouraging.",1324004127

3359178,comment,3355876,3359050,5,0,tomkarlo,,,"I'd take issue with your definition of ""easy"". Even if we had self-driving cars today, it would still be a matter of a phone call to get major traffic arteries closed, whereas there's no guarantee that any group of individuals could work out a way to turn off the cars. You're comparing a known, implemented process with a hypothetical possibility. Similarly, terrorists _could_ conceivably hack their way into a traffic control system, but it's a lot more likely they'd simply try to take over a plane with brute force.<p>This is similar to ""tin hat"" theories: they favor the dramatic and insidious, but unlikely, fear over the much more imminent and mundane problem.<p>I'm more than willing to give up the right to absolute control over my vehicle in return for better safety and faster commutes. The lives saved in both time and accidents would far outweigh the remote possibility that it would be used as an instrument of oppression. Maybe folks can control their own vehicle when off of major arteries, but be required to give up control on heavily shared routes (the same as they have to when taking public transportation.)",1324003648

Even Scoble for that matter. And yes honestly, their style of writing came off to me as almost a bit classist some of the time.<p>Now, I just don't care. I realize that I was getting upset by their writing because they are such good writers. Its the same way that the democrats get mad at Rush Limbaugh. You may know that he said something wrong and on the border of crackpot but he is just so damn good at doing it. If someone else said it, you would write them off as a lunatic. His style is partly meant to convince but it is also partly meant to incite as well.<p>So yes, MG and Gruber are bias and when it comes to tech reviews I just don't trust them. Whether it is pro Apple or anti another product. And in the case of Scoble, his silicon valley tunnel vision turns me off. But I will still read their articles because they are good at what they do. And if I start to get a ""WTF?!"" moment then I will just calm down and realize that it is part of the entertainment package that comes along with reading them.<p>P.S. If you're a sports fan, Grubers sports tweets are way more maddening than his Apple lust.",1324001046

You could easily describe all the boy-targeted movie tie-in Lego sets that same way. Heck you can describe <i>any</i> Lego set that way. I had a Lego train set and a freighter with a dock as a kid (as an example). You could easily claim that these were no different than ""an HO train set that you have to put together first"" and ""a toy boat that you have to put together first.""",1324001011

Whatever you do, we'll copy it, especially if it's something authoritarian (which is kind of ""our thing"" here in Europe anyway).<p>Another problem is that it doesn't matter how many times a SOPA-like law is stopped in time.

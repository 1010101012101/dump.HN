Sexist opinions in the tech industry (and/or culture in general) have lead to a hostile workplace for a woman whose job includes going to many tech conferences and who often hears sexist jokes and other (unstated) sexist statements. These are a form of verbal sexual harassment, which is a type of verbal abuse.<p>To continue from the same Wikipedia citation for ""Verbal abuse"", ""In reality, however, verbal abuse can be more detrimental to a person's health than physical abuse.""",1363928249

Sometimes, just for being unlucky. (Startups work that way, too. Every job, these days, does that.) Also, it's correct that bonus is most of total compensation for top people-- sometimes over 90%-- which means not getting one really blows, but Wall Street salaries aren't exactly bad. If you were expecting a $3 million bonus, on top of your $250,000 salary, and got a Goose Egg during Comp, then are canned a month later with 6 months' severance, well... my heart bleeds for you. You've got half a year to get another job and, unless the market's completely fucked (cf. 2008) you'll get a promotion. Failed trading options? You'll trade something else if you want to trade, or you can move elsewhere. VCs will fund anyone with the Finance Stamp of Approval, at least in New York. Foursquare for ostrich farm? Here's your rocket fuel, now hire some ninjas and move the needle.<p>Personally, though, I wouldn't want to be a trader. Quant is as close to that game as I'd want to go.

I'll give you that.<p>Sure, you can get another job after a failed startup, but usually as a subordinate, and that's viewed as dishonorable after 35 and untenable past 40. If you fail as a derivatives trader, VC-istan will let you be a <i>founder</i>. Sure, you're going from $250k plus a possible 1000% bonus to $200k and 15% of a startup.

(Last year?) that pretty much said, ""cameras are okay anywhere at Defcon"" though there were disagreements on how much was included with ""everywhere at Defcon"" such as CTF players, room, and screens.<p>> Yea it was changed last year, but I still told everyone at 101 NOT to take pictures without permission (ie: While DefCon Policy say's this, you may want to do this) And I probably will do it again, because it's a good rule to have. The ""Policy"" may say that pictures can be taken anywhere at anytime.

5421297,comment,5421260,5421260,3,0,mindcrime,,,"Wow, that really resonates with me.  As an enterprise play, we are definitely at risk of picking the wrong segment here.  Although, our options are a little bit more limited due to the nature of our products.  We're doing what you might call ""Enterprise 2.0"" stuff, operating at the intersection of social-networking (see: Enterprise Social Network), social-network-analysis, information retrieval and business process management...  The stuff we're building really only starts to have utility <i>in</i> the larger companies.  So we're still interviewing people, and researching and exploring to try and find the right target segment.<p>There's a train of thought in my mind, fueled by our first big round of Customer Discovery interviews, that we are looking at (using employee count as a rough approximation for overall company size) companies with 1000 employees or more.  <i>Maybe</i> it really starts at 500 employees, but we're still working on that. Depending on where you draw the line between deer and elephant, we could wind up in either segment (or both).<p>Rabbits are definitely out for us though, at least given our current model.  If things don't work going this route, we could pivot to a SaaS app that does less, and go down-market to the smaller companies.  We did interview a few smaller companies earlier and saw some interest in that model, so it could be an option.<p>Our next step is to do a very focused Customer Discovery effort, focusing on manufacturing companies in the Southeast (mainly NC to start with, since that's where we are) with 1000 employees and up.  But we'll mix in a few of the ones that are between 500 and 1000 as well, as we try to isolate the right focus.<p>The idea of landing an elephant or two <i>does</i> seem tempting, but msuster makes some good points there.  We definitely don't want to get too caught up special-casing stuff for one big customer, to the point that they become our <i>only</i> customer, because we can't serve anybody else!",1363924933

I&#x27;m also wary of the impact that AI and robotics may have but am cautiously optimistic. While I do think that many jobs will be displaced by automation, I wonder if we&#x27;ll also see a labor revolution or rather emergence of a new sector/type of jobs. E.F. Schumacher talked a lot about the dehumanizing nature of many jobs, and I think in a perfect world automation and robotics could take over the repetitive or dangerous jobs, freeing those workers to take on more fulfilling and important jobs.",1408150601

All you need is a mechanism to notify users (or their client software) that a name is designated as malicious. Then the user or the user&#x27;s client can decide what to do with that information, including ignoring the designation and connecting to the address anyway. That way it can&#x27;t be used for censorship but it can be used to put ye olde red screen of malware alert in front of the user.",1408150585

You can get a lot of the bang-for-the-buck with this approach without incurring huge rewrite costs.

There are no Ksplice updates loaded until you tell them to load and Ksplice does not make any modifications to the actual Kernel binary, so #2 isn&#x27;t really an issue.  The real problem is there may be limitations on when you can reboot, leaving you in a vulnerable state. Sure, an ideal environment would let you reboot any system at any time, but those places are like unicorn ranches.<p>I completely agree with your last comment, though: systems suffer from weird bit-rot diseases.

Chatter about that problem or other solutions (buzz)<p>C. Competitors selling products in that vertical (precedent)<p>D. Competitors bidding on keywords related to that vertical<p>Determining #2 is harder / more nuanced; and to a certain extent is a fruitless endeavor until you&#x27;ve hit significant sample sizes. The first 10 people you try to sell might say no, that doesn&#x27;t mean the product is wrong for the market; that could just be random chance. The only sure-fire way to test product-market fit is to get your product in front of a statistically significant number of users, and see if they bite.<p>I use the term &quot;bite&quot; because I don&#x27;t mean &quot;convert&quot;.

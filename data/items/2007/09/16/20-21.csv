(yet)<p>From what I can tell, it seems more that users who would be ready to make the jump from windows to linux are opting for macs instead. <p>A rails conference I was at last year was 99% mac. I'd assume most of the web languages are the same. This is especially true in the laptop segment, which seems to be growing as well. <p>If I were apple, I'd stay the course. Looking at market shares when a vast majority of people aren't even replacing their xp boxes is kinda useless. Give it a year and those boxes will be a year older. Most of them won't be moving to vista.",1189975907

A little bit can make me a bit more alert and optimistic, but then I pay for it with interest on the caffeine hangover / comedown.  Besides, more than a little bit of it makes me much too restless and chatty to program anyway.<p>Junk food is a lose for me too.  Anything that causes a blood sugar spike hurts productivity.  I like peanut butter on bananas, red leaf lettuce, cheese, ... and of course burritos.  Water to drink.",1189975314

And where I believe opportunity lies.  <p>Why you'd never want to foolishly leave critical caveats and limitations outside of your offers, we need to be cognizant that each element of fine print moves us closer to offering nothing more than a trick or gimmick.  <p>Food for thought.\n",1189974957

I would defy you to produce any fruits of sociology that are comparable to those of mathematics (remembering that everything in science and engineering hedges upon math).",1189974896

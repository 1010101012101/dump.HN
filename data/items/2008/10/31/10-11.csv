349830,comment,349421,349614,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"timr, sometimes I think you're from another planet.<p>I said I'd like for the politics to stay off the board, but basically it was impossible to do because of the nature of all of us humans that were interacting here. There is a conflict between what we would like and what is best for the board and our nature.<p>You took that and made it out to be some kind of hypocritical statement. Is there something about how we never meet our own ideals that you can't understand? I mean, maybe you're much better than this, but I find myself acting at odds with my own standards all the time -- it's part of the human condition.<p>In fact, because of this conflict and inevitability, I agreed with you on another thread that it would be good to try to figure out how to bring the political discussions in. I guess you could say that's hypocritical of me because it conflicts the the OP of this thread, but that would be easily missing the point too.",1225449019
349829,comment,349676,349784,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"This exchange is a classic example of a failure to communicate.  We have the uber-geek founder of one of the most successful companies of the time and a dumb reporter who just wants some standard fluff to cut-and-paste into his article and neither party really understands the other.  While Walker clearly exposed the guy as being prejudiced and ill-informed, he should have realized even before the interview that it wasn't in the best interest of his company to allow that to happen.<p>Walker clearly ""won"" the argument but he lost an opportunity to communicate the reasons for Autodesk's successes.",1225448992

Ok so the first time was a bit blunt and when I qualified it with a reply it got upvoted again.<p>But the second time I didn't bother (even though I basically made the same comment further up the page - on a slightly different slant/discussion) and it got upvoted.<p>It always comes down to the users and their whims in the end :P<p>This place is a lot better than most :D",1225448846

349824,comment,349798,349798,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"I am a mathematics student and sometimes need to look up papers. A lot of these papers are in journals not available online and have references to more of such papers. This can sometimes make even understanding a relatively simple proof that could be explain in a book in a few pages a gruesome all-day ordeal where 3/4th of the time is spent looking up references.<p>It would be <i></i>really freaking cool<i></i> if Google (Scholar?) could scan these articles into PDFs, then attempt to OCR the references and see if Google has indexed those, then embed hyperlinks to the references. This is technically feasible, and I imagine it would really make a lot of researchers very happy.",1225448038

It seems to be seen as a display of hysteria on the helper's part. That's why most people act ""too cool"" to actually do something - better not risk that precious reputation.<p>Better a few false positives than a false negative.",1225447882
349820,story,,,3,1,technoguyrob,"Ask YC: Question about writing Terms & Conditions (getting users to read them)",,"I am working on an application that might touch some legal gray areas in occasional circumstances.<p>I usually skip any Terms & Conditions for 99% of the stuff I sign up for on the web. There are three reasons for this:<p>1. They are hard to read, as they are usually a list of clauses and subclauses in legal terms.<p>2. I don't have the time, usually it's something small like a forum account or trying out some new web-app.<p>3. I've never actually had any scenario in my life where having read the Terms & Conditions would somehow have made a difference for me (in <i></i>any<i></i> way).<p>These three reasons combined are very strong, and probably apply to a lot of people as well.<p>One thing I have noticed is that I have read the Terms & Conditions (in abbreviated and easy to read form) <i></i>every time<i></i> Google wrote some thing like ""this is not the usual yadda yadda!"" They have done this for several of their apps and services that touched on privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation by Google Toolbar).<p>This leads me to the following question. Would it be a good idea to have two huge buttons right above my T&C, ""English"" and ""Legalese"", with the default set to the former? English would provide a nice little blurb that summed it up in a few sentences, and clicking ""Legalese"" would do a Javascript layover that actually listed the clauses.<p>I am of course thinking that yes, that is a good idea, but I am asking because (1) I have not seen anyone do anything like this or anything similar (hence, is there some reason this would not be a good thing?), and (2) if the user clicks ""Accept"" having only read the English blurb without clicking ""Legalese"", is it still legally binding?<p>I guess a corollary to my question is why <i></i>isn't<i></i> this being done frequently?",1225447702

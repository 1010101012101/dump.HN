A third of people who get shot to death are shot by the cops.  It's not like it's the 70's in Chicago or anything, but it's never ""safe"".<p>But we don't need perfect safety to be proud.  The most common statement going around my social networks is ""Most of what you need to know about Bostonians is summed up in the fact that their blood banks were already full today"".  People lend each other their cell phones regularly.  Those hospitals are always saving lives.  These things are part of being decent human beings.  Just because there are non-decent human beings out there can't diminish that.<p>We are cynical, because we have to be.

Green is ~510nm, red is ~650nm, blue is ~475nm. The difference between the absorption of Hb and HbO2 in the red range is the reason why pulse oximeters use red. In this case, we don't care about differentiating oxy- vs. deoxy-hemoglobin, we just care about the total absorption. Since more light is absorbed at green than at red, it will show more of an effect with pulse.<p>I am not confident in this explanation, and still don't know why green over blue.",1366127930

I'll call these two parts the evaluator and the executor.<p>* It's the evaluator's job to evaluate expressions. Expressions are primitive recursive so they always normalize.<p>* The executor's job is to talk to the outside world and to provide data to the evaluator and receive commands from the evaluator. It also can't get stuck in an infinite loop; it must eventually provide data to the evaluator after receiving a command.<p>The only way an infinite loop can happen is if the evaluator and the executor get stuck together.<p>When I said processor before, I was referring to the part that did the processing: i.e. the evaluator.",1366127928
5558879,comment,5558023,5558788,1,0,B-Con,,,"Personally, I've always mentally preferred an ordering with the noun first followed by increasing levels of restrictiveness. In my <i>head</i>, that's how I think. I then have to translate that into proper English grammar.<p>It makes sense to me because I'm providing as much detail as necessary, but giving as much detail up front as possible. For example, when saying ""the [adjective_detailed], [adjective_general] [noun]"", what if the last word were lost? Then you'd have <i>no</i> idea what the phrase was about. And for the listener, you start with the most useless of detail and have to remember it, applying it to more useful of information as it comes in, and you have no idea what's being spoken about until you've heard the end. So then you have to backup and apply the adjectives once you've actually heard the noun. It makes (IMO) bad structure for parsing. Conversely, with the most general detail first, you drill down to the necessary level of detail as you speak, and continuously describe something the listener already heard.",1366127917

5558876,comment,5555461,5556640,2,0,mikeyouse,,,"From the first article:<p><pre><code>  Let’s be generous and assume that the overall multiplier on tax cuts is 1. Then the per-year effect of the plan on GDP is 150 x 1 + 240 x 1.5 = $510 billion. Since it takes $300 billion to reduce the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point, this is shaving 1.7 points off what unemployment would otherwise have been.\n\n  Finally, compare this with the economic outlook. “Full employment” clearly means an unemployment rate near 5 — the CBO says 5.2 for the NAIRU, which seems high to me. Unemployment is currently about 7 percent, and heading much higher; Obama himself says that absent stimulus it could go into double digits. Suppose that we’re looking at an economy that, absent stimulus, would have an average unemployment rate of 9 percent over the next two years; this plan would cut that to 7.3 percent, which would be a help but could easily be spun by critics as a failure.\n</code></pre>\nThe math is obvious... if the economy was going to 9% unemployment without stimulus (which we now know was too optimistic), with the same composition of tax cuts : spending, $1T would be called for. Since we peaked at 10% unemployment, even with ~1T in stimulus (which should've had a ~4% impact on the rate), with this math, $2.25T could've been about right.<p>The CBO looked back at real output / unemployment and made the following estimates.[1]<p>- <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/dbimages/master/29996/GR_120620_gdprecoveryact1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/dbimages/master/29996/GR_120620_gdprec...</a><p>Which shows the impact of the ARRA. So it seems that between 2-3% reduction in peak unemployment with ~1T. So again, something like $2.5T would've been close.<p>The point all along is that too little stimulus is far more damaging than too much, and with unemployment still above 7.5% five years later, that point seems to have some evidence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/ARRA_One-Col.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a>",1366127908

When you hear about repeaters, they're used to repeat the low-powered handheld VHF/UHF signal (~5W max) to a stronger signal so more people can hear it. Repeaters are controlled and maintained by volunteers and not the government. They don't even allocate fequencies for repeaters. Registering is voluntary and it's controlled by local frequency coordinators who are again just volunteers.<p>The FCC and the government takes a very hands off approach to Amateur Radio.

For example, when describing a modern brick house, we know that ""modern"" and ""brick"" have to go somewhere, but putting ""modern"" after ""brick"" makes it impotent, so we put it before.

Some economists wanted to find a solution for the depression. Initially one of the economists came up with the idea that planned obsolescence should be controlled by the government. Check out Bernard's London paper on the right of this page:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence</a>\nThe idea was that products would later be gathered and destroyed by a commission or something. A similar approach was used by Phoebus Cartel, which fined factories which made light bulbs lasting over 1000 years. According to the documentary, it still exists after multiple name changes.<p>I don't remember the exact details, but the documentary then proceeds to show many commercials and famous designers who promoted new goods with short life span. Instead of the government making people give up their stuff and destroy it once time is up, the focus was on ""low quality"" and advertising.<p>Here's the link to full polish version on youtube:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPPW8KM7eEU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPPW8KM7eEU</a><p>It's dubbed, but you can hear many interviewed people talk in english.

A few minutes later the section with commercials starts. ""Planned obsolescence. A desire by the consumer to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary...""<p>The documentary doesn't mention STEAM, but I think it's similar. STEAM is DRM in sheep's clothing. It comes bundled with so many extras (I can live without) such as friends lists, IM, automatic patching. These days, people are asking developers to publish on STEAM. They are seduced.<p>As for games in general and planned obsolescence - after watching this documentary I think I know why so many games these days are linear, story-based and short.",1366127034

Any given language -- even one's first language -- is learned. It's learned in stages, and true, one tends to pick up the rules by immersion before studying them consciously. But conscious study of the rules is extremely beneficial to improving one's understanding of, and facility with, a given language.<p>To say that ""no conscious understanding of the rules is required"" is a little like saying ""Kobe Bryant is a naturally born basketball genius."" True, Kobe Bryant may have certain athletic gifts and mental wiring that enable him to exceed 99.999999% of the world at basketball skill. But he learned the rules of the game, just like everyone else. And he practices daily. In fact, he probably practices harder than many of his less talented peers. Even someone of his natural endowments couldn't have risen to his level without conscious and repeated effort.<p>It's true that grammar and syntax start to seem natural and subconscious over time, especially as one improves in linguistic fluency.

Single-threading is a hair shirt that results in better code in the long run, like laziness in haskell. And async I/O is so much more performant than blocking (in modern application stacks) that that's making node dominate there.<p>I do wonder whether other languages could have ended up the same way if threading hadn't been invented. Perl always had these unreliable bodged threads, and so there were some really interesting event-driven libraries for it - but the threads were good enough for many practical uses, and AFAIK the ecosystem never converged on a single approach. Did I hear of a PEP attempting to standardise a compatible API for doing these things in python?",1366126250

Face detection, file integrity hashing) And if it could do on the fly video transcoding (don't even think about it) it could happily replace another full system i have running plex server.<p>There's probably a lot of devices that the designers default to arm but have to skip features that are heavy fp.

I’m not entirely sure why this happens or what happens near the end, but here’s one plausible explanation:\n> When the benchmark starts, 100 concurrent requests are sent to the web server. A maximum number of 16 threads, and thus 16 requests, are allocated by Puma at once. The 17th request will block until one of the 16 threads currently in use is finished. However, since we’re executing 100 concurrent requests, there will be 84 requests waiting (100-16). Looking at the requests in the generated puma.dat file (generated with ab -r -n 10000 -c 100 -T 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -g puma.dat -p ../live_streaming/post <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages</a>), we see that exactly 84 requests have been waiting for execution. These are the requests that were issued first, but have never been allocated to a thread by Puma. As a result, they have been waiting for the entire benchmark. I’m not sure why Puma would behave like this.<p>That protracted explanation is predicated on the inference that the data is ordered chronologically. Many, many people make this mistake (google ""apache bench gnuplot""). I always thought it was as well. I don't know why I never looked at the starttime or seconds columns of the data.",1366125764

Graph reduction is extremely imperative (see: spineless stackless g-machine), which makes it map well on a Von Neumann processor, but limits the amount of exploitable parallelism. Relying on lazy semantics also wrecks parallelism, because some evaluation branches cannot be visited ahead of time, without changing the program's semantics.<p>A functional language using eager semantics and string-reduction execution would map much better on, say, a parallel dataflow processor.

There is no Congress of Languages that passes a Law of Tongues, no first principle of language that requires things to be conjugated this way or ordered in this way. Language is a temporary contract between the speaker and the listener. A protocol that if I use these sounds in this way, I have a pretty good notion that information will be transferred to the listener.<p>Over time, as needs change, the contract changes and what I need to say to transfer information changes. More importantly, I have to keep track of several contracts because not all listeners have signed the same one! This is called code-switching, and it's why I talk to my boss differently than to my much younger niece than to my mechanic.<p>Language prescriptivists don't seem to understand that and will refer to their favorite dictionary and grammar guide (usually published sometime between the 18th and 19th centuries and written by people of the same ilk trying desperately to coax order from chaos) as if they contained the great laws handed down from the God of Languages and will try and convert the World by force to sign the contract that they think all the world should be on.<p>There are no rules in language, only guidelines.",1366125114

We used ColdFusion for both the Front-End and the ""Commerce Server"" and the commerce server only took credit card information from the front-end and could not give it back. It was behind its own hardware firewall and any exploit in ColdFusion would have been hidden from the front end unless it could be exploited through the API methods we exposed through the gateway. To gain access to any other url endpoints you would need to access the server from within the firewall by connecting to a VPN gateway on a separate physical network that was only connected by a dedicated T1 to our office. We did this before there was PCI, because it made sense.<p>The whole system has now been rewritten in dotNET. It would be interesting to see if I can find that old CF app. It ran solid for almost ten years on the same 3 NT4 servers handling tens of thousands of users per day.

In addition...<p>1) It was most common then to go the cgi-bin route for server side, which wasn't pleasant. CF offered an alternative to that very early on and made webdev more ""accessible"".<p>2) ColdFusion was baked into a lot of GUI based web design tools (I can only think of the name of one, NetObjects Fusion, because I rarely used those sorts of tools). Even though they probably weren't using a GUI based tool, being baked into several meant that peoples' exposure to CF was pretty common. I did absolutely nothing with ColdFusion, but routinely ran into it with freelance work I did.<p>3) In a large ""enterprise"" shops, I remember losing a bid because a manager Google(tm)'ed PHP, saw that it was originally stood for ""personal home page"" and told me they needed to hire someone more professional (thank God I dodged that bullet). The comfort with the current offering of open source web programming languages, in general, made managers uncomfortable for various FUD reasons. Case in point, I remember on the Windows side CF jobs getting eclipsed, nearly overnight, by RFPs for ASP in VBScript.  ASP, after all, was backed by Microsoft, commercial, and effectively free (included with their Windows NT/2000 Servers).",1366124992

5558543,comment,5557647,5557647,4,0,gline,,,"There seem to be two schools of thought here, both interesting to me. The author seems to think that his failure has something to do with problems associated with the ""lean startup"" model and other commenters (lean startup adherents, apparently) seem to hink his failure has something to do with failing to properly follow the tenets of the philosophy.<p>I suspect actually that the author adhered about as closely to ""lean startup"" as many self-identified ""lean startups"" who have succeeded in the past, and made a pretty average number of mistakes in the process. I don't think of 'lean startup' as a way to guarantee success, I think of it as a way to fail gracefully if you don't succeed. The author came pretty close to this, actually - it doesn't sound like they burned through enormous piles of venture capital money, it seems like they learned a lot in the process, it seems like they didn't spectacularly fail to make payroll causing half a dozen family-bound engineers to suddenly lose their livelihoods. The only less-than-graceful element of their failure was that it took two years, which is probably a little (though not a lot) on the long side. Frankly late in the process they came pretty close to scoring what sounds like it would have been a pivotal investor, and that combined with lessons learned could have produced a true MVP, product market fit, and a viable startup...<p>So, I think the author successfully followed a good chunk of lean software advice, made some mistakes, got unlucky, and failed. This is what most startups do - even most lean startups - and there should be no shame in it. Paul Graham himself has remarked he wishes he were able to bring himself to invest in more likely-to-fail black swans because that's the way you get to own enough vol to have a real winner in your portfolio - we all should be more comfortable with the risk of failure.",1366124947

I think that everyone would agree that there is <i>some</i> rent-seeking behavior on wall street, and everyone would agree that the banking sector plays a critical role in the economy (moving money from where it is to where it is needed, and managing risk).  So the real disagreement is about the ratio.<p>This article seems to imply that only a quarter of wall street's activities produce economic value.  That's very low, lower than I've read anywhere.  However, Paul Woolley at the LSE estimates that the financial sector would be a ""third to a half"" of its size (see link below), though, if it were limited to the wealth-producing activities.  It's a controversial statement, of course, but he's hardly alone in this estimate.<p>For anyone interested in this topic, I'd recommend starting with a New Yorker article titled ""what good is wall street?""<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_cassidy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_...</a><p>And follow the links to the researchers listed to read more about the details that are not included in the New Yorker article.",1366124670

In both cases, the user would benefit from posts having tags denoting subject content, and from a search facility so that I can find things that specifically interest me. If you have five hundred videos about mathematics, finding one on Analytic Topology, say, by scrolling through them would be a bit painful.\nI also think it would be good if the lectures had some way of tying subsequent videos together - it seems a tiny bit messy to have 'Cosmology - Lecture 1', and 'Cosmology - Lecture 2' as separate entries.\nI'm also not certain that you want to limit lectures to being videos. A well-written explanation of a broad subject is sometimes better than a video that I can't search or skim through - and I think it serves a different purpose from the articles. It's also easier for your community to add written content than videos.<p>Hope that was useful to you - but obviously take it all with a pinch of salt.

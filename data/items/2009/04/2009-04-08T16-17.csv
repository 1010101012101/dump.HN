I'm thinking of the way github does gems, where the gems are all namespaced with a username. There could be 20 versions of array#sum, but the one that the pioneers/influencers/cool-kids-who-write-frameworks decide to use is the one that gets used. If someone decides to go their own way, someone else will fork and fix.<p>Maybe conflicts could be detected at the gem level via gems exposing the names of the monkey patched methods they contain.<p>Honestly I think git/github fundamentally changes some things and that we as a culture haven't yet fully adapted our thinking to the new possibilities.<p>Of course there will always be problems, and maybe this is utopian crazy talk, but the natural ""that can't possibly work"" reaction might be worth questioning.<p>EDIT:<p>Allow me to go from just crazy to total nutter: a language market where the commodity is semantics and the currency is popularity.

People who are good at <i>anything</i> reject arbitrary structure. If your power is your talent, an organization which assigns power based on anything else is an obstacle for you. Nevertheless, such people can be happy with structure, if it elevates people they consider to be smarter or more capable than they are.<p>I don't think it's unique to programmers. The only reason why this phenomenon is so pronounced in our world is that we have greater than 10:1 productivity ratios among programmers.<p>By the way, not following the herd doesn't mean you're just undisciplined. One of the better programmers I've known wore only t-shirts and rarely even wore shoes in the office, and was considered half-impossible to deal with. But, he was actually more aware than the rest of us about how the whole organization ran, politically, and when he did make concessions, his managers felt like they had succeeded. Of course, you have to be insanely productive to get away with this, so it's not for everyone.",1239209891

I can give you a definition of ethics, morality is trickier so I may be able to only summarize a few points.<p>Ethics is a system of determining <i>right action</i> for individuals and groups of individuals from a set of commonly held values. For example: if equity is a value, then preferential treatment becomes a wrong. Ethics works by finding common values and working from them. The fact that value is subjective has no bearing; ethical systems merely look for a common denominator and work from there. Different ethical systems are the product of applying different philosophical methodologies to different values sets.<p>Morality is very different. It is the object of the assumption that there is a universal set of rules and values to which all human beings must, for some reason or other, assent. What this universal code consists of, isn't necessarily universally accepted, but what is universally accepted, or nearly so, is the assumption that there is a universal code. That a physicalist, or mechanistic account of the universe cannot account for this is evident. That very few human beings actually accept a physicalist or mechanistic worldview, even if they claim to do so, is also evident. It presupposes some kind of telos, or universal purpose.<p>So what morality is, is this: an objective standard of behavior that is (instinctualy) assumed by everybody, agreed (in total; the vast majority hold a large number of principles in common and differ only on application, hence the need for ethics) upon by few, and can only be fully accounted for by some kind of metaphysics.<p>Edit: spelling and word usage",1239209523

552933,comment,552339,552462,0,0,soldarnal,,,"Your comparison of depopulation to ""overpopulation in an already overpopulated world"" is hardly just.  Really you are comparing population decline with population growth, but with the latter in a very particular context in which it is known to be harmful.  In contrast, nobody is concerned about population growth among polar bears (but many seem concerned about their potential depopulation).<p>Regardless, the concern of the article isn't even whether or not depopulation is bad; in fact it states: ""In the modern era, population decline itself need not be a cause for acute economic alarm.""  Rather the concern is that Russia's depopulation is fueled by increases in illness and mortality.  Just my personal opinion, but death and disease are bad things.  The article claims that, furthermore, they are bad things for economic growth over the long term.",1239208260

In addition, I've got no interest in using Java for developing web applications, so that plays into it as well.<p>The beautiful truth is that no one is forcing anyone to use any of these projects.  I am just happy to be making software at a time where there are so many frameworks and tools whose developers not only make their work available for free, but welcome my contributions if I'd like to put in the time.",1200063466

I don't think so.<p>I don't deny that they might be different in orientation. But which one is a better bet, the one that tries to anticipate all your needs and make you happy (Spring), or the one that only cares for the needs of it's developers? Not saying either way - bloat might be a problem for some, but Spring is very modular, you can only use parts if you want to.<p>Spring earns more money if more people adapt it, so they try to make it as good as possible. What is the incentive for Rails, I don't know? Economically, their incentive would have to be to get their competition in trouble, to their own benefit? Perhaps they don't even use Rails internally ;-)<p>Actually Spring also grew out of frustration and personal need, it was a result of Rod Johnson's experiences as consultant, if I remember correctly.",1200062009

There's no vendor behind it that stands to (directly) make money if more people adopt it.<p>One thing to remember about Rails was the context in which it was conceived.  Rails was not designed as a framework; rather, it was extracted from a real project as a useful skeleton.  It is ""opinionated software"" conceived and publicized as a reaction to the bloated frameworks in the Java world.  Edge cases are pushed out into plugins, features generally have to be rejected several times before they make it into core, etc.",1200060441

The presenters for delivering sub-par presentations, and the viewers for suffering sub-par presentations. Company image and customer satisfaction suffer. All because of one person's doing.

I was afraid they were going to advocate locking data up inside of a proprietary app and only releasing that to the public in place of releasing the raw data!<p>I ran into this years ago with the IMDB dataset.  It appears to be formatted such that it aggressively resists sane parsing.  Of course, I expected to want to update the data and whatnot, so I built code to download the data files or updates, parse them, and put them into a Sane Format (in my book, only CSV and JSON qualify right now).  Then I wrote a simple tool to take any generic JSON and create tables from it and insert all the data.  This just always seemed to be the right thing to do to me.  Just hacking the file into a useable format and plunging ahead with analysis seemed like a bad option to me, but I take it from this article that it is the common approach?<p>It may just be an artifact of the kinds of systems I&#x27;ve worked on (bank, govt) but I&#x27;m not comfortable unless &#x27;deployment&#x27; consists of executing 1 script which can take a system from absolute barebones (no DB schema, no existing tables, no prearranged libraries, nothing) to production-ready.  What if you have a catastrophe and your backups are hosed?  What if you want to spin off a new environment for testing?  The idea that there has to be existing state whose personal history is assumed to be in a certain state, or that after the system deploys someone has to grab some scripts out of their home directory and remember to apply them (and in the right order) before things can get going just terrifies me.

Not sure how well it would work in SV...<p>Probably one of the best comments I&#x27;ve seen on HN on some of the benefits of NYC over SV.<p>Back in 1999 my company needed servers set up at a colo in Sunnyvale, so I flew out to the Bay Area.  Saturday evening I head over to Fry&#x27;s Electronics, and unexpectedly run into a friend of mine who had moved out to the Bay Area.  We agree to meet later for dinner, then he says let&#x27;s head back to his office.<p>We walk in to his office at 9 PM and Saturday.  The entire office is there, sitting at their desks.  90% male, if not more.  This was their life.<p>The thing though was - this was not Facebook, this was not Google.  I can see doing that amount of work in some years in order to get a payoff.  This was a company which it was obvious to me at the time, was going nowhere.  It raised about $60 million from Kleiner Perkins in 2000, and has hobbled along since then, with another $30 million of Kleiner money in subsequent years.  Last year the New York Times said the company and business &quot;remains something of a work in progress&quot;, was &quot;lagging many earlier expectations&quot; and was still a small business.  I could easily foresee this at the time.<p>It&#x27;s one of the problems.  People at Facebook, Google etc. worked all hours in the early years, so every company feels they have to emulate that.  But Google&#x27;s don&#x27;t come around every day - I was sending e-mail&#x27;s to Google asking them to employ me back when they were still hosted at Stanford.  \nIt&#x27;s obvious that many people would trade a few years of very hard work for the spigot of money early Facebook and Google employees got.  But between such black swans, you want to have the ability to make a decent living working 40 hours a week, and live in a community where you can have a life beyond your tech job.<p>It&#x27;s not working hard versus having a life, it&#x27;s not wanting to work 60+ hours a week when you&#x27;re just spinning wheels.  I&#x27;ve worked at companies where people started staying until 6, 7, 8 PM for no real reason.  Then I learn there is trouble at home with their marriage, they often get a divorce.  They stay at work because they don&#x27;t want to go home and spend time with their spouse.  It&#x27;s what bothers me about SV, work for works sake, everything beyond focused on tech.  If you catch a ride on a black swan it&#x27;s a great thing, but if you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s not much good about it.",1411695205

We know about many\nof them quite well, e.g., grass mowing (the guys\nthat mow grass in my neighborhood arrive with about\n$70,000 in capital equipment and 3-4 people), pizza\nshops, Chinese carry out shops, red/white checkered\ntable cloth, red sauce Italian-American restaurants,\nauto body shops, auto repair shops, barber shops,\nkitchen remodeling, residential construction general\ncontractors, suburban paving, masonry, a dental\npractice, a family medical practice, an independent\ninsurance company, a SOHO law firm, a CPA accounting\nfirm, and, actually, many more that are B2B and less\nwell known, e.g., wholesale plumbing, manufacturer&#x27;s\nrepresentative, electrical engineering, and more\ngenerally a huge range of <i>big truck/little truck</i>\nbusinesses.<p>With this background, I come to the main<p>Point:  Now these businesses are often sole\nproprietorships, file taxes as a Subchapter S, are\nnot Delaware C corporations, do not have a board of\ndirectors, have no one with an MBA, and have never\nwatched a lecture such as Altman&#x27;s.

But\nfirst step, make it through the stage of a <i>small\nbusiness</i>, and that should not necessarily be wildly\ndifferent from running, say, a pizza shop.<p>So, since I&#x27;m eager to learn, where is this little\npoint wrong?",1411694306

Your feedback is hugely appropriated.<p>That said, a few thoughts:<p>1. The link based penalty stems from the fact the traffic drops correlate exactly with Penguin release dates. Also, the &quot;official&quot; volunteers and other good folks over at the Google Webmaster forms came to the same conclusion. Before those exact dates I had ranked on page 1 for &quot;php web form software&quot;, and page 1 or 2 for &quot;web form software&quot;, since mid-2008.<p>To that end, you&#x27;re 100% correct the market is tough, but we&#x27;re a very specialized form builder, made especially for developers.<p>As far as deserving Page 1 - Google used to think so for several years, as my product is pretty darn great if you need flexible form software. We have four versions, two of which are free, covering both self-hosted and SaaS models. No one even comes close to offering such a wide variety of solutions.<p>In short, if you need form software and you find my site you&#x27;re guaranteed not to be disappointed. If nothing else you&#x27;re able to choose between two pretty awesome free versions, something no one else offers. I&#x27;m also ecstatic to answer questions and help users out, even if they don&#x27;t buy or use my software. I would think this would be of high value to Google -- and it certainly used to be before the penalty.<p>As far as the site recommendations: I&#x27;m taking these to heart for sure, though I have to say, the previously mentioned Google Webmaster forums -- the current site is a direct result of working with them for over 3 months, making the exact same types of changes and improvements. Nothing, and I mean nothing, worked.<p>I didn&#x27;t know at the time, but it was recently stated by John Mueller from Google that a Penguin recovery is simply not possible until they refresh and release a new version of the Penguin algorithm.<p>So at the end of the day, sadly, (and please do not take this as dismissive as you bet I&#x27;ll be making changes): my problem is not content or structure, it&#x27;s that darn link penalty.<p>All the while, and again, I&#x27;m not sure who this benefits.",1411693641

If I drank one drink at the end I was physically compelled to have another. Imagine a terrible itch. You have to scratch it. Heavy drinking alcoholics have such strong physical addictions that detox without medical supervision can be life threatening. Your reaction wondering why millions of people choose AA and abstinence vs trying to &quot;cut back&quot; is misinformed but not uncommon.<p>Second and more importantly IMO the misconception that AA requires a traditional faith or GOD experience is what kept me out for years. Part of working the steps is finding &quot;a higher power&quot; and I know many atheists in the program that consider that to be Good Orderrly Direction (GOD) vs a spiritual or dogmatic experience.<p>But the true &quot;work&quot; of the program is centered around confronting your wreckage of the past and confronting life on life&#x27;s terms vs utilizing alcohol as a mechanism to check out of life.",1411693360

That&#x27;s sounds unlikely.<p>Water forms naturally given enough hydrogen and oxygen at a wide range of temperatures. Since hydrogen is everywhere, and since main-sequence stars produce tons of oxygen via fusion, there&#x27;s probably a lot of water floating around in the universe. When a nebula collapses into a protoplanetary disk, the increased density makes it even more likely that gas molecules will meet one another and form compounds.",1411693338

8370740,comment,8369734,8369734,2,0,otakucode,,,"Technology is still freaking people out.  I suppose it&#x27;s understandable.  For centuries, humanity progressed with just incremental little improvements in productivity from year to year... then automation technology and computers show up and everything explodes.  Workers are able to produce 10x or 20x or 200x as much in the same time period.  Wages were the first to go, immediately divorcing themselves from any relationship to the amount of value the worker produces for the company.<p>This sounds to me like an outgrowth of that.  &quot;Can this little bit of software really be worth THAT much?&quot;  When it sparks exponential growth and enables a company to be active in a global marketplace with a handful of employees, yes, it absolutely can be.  But with a voluntarily blinded eye turned to the actual value of software, everything looks the same.  An app to waste a few hours in entertainment, or a system to automate part of customer service?  Which one can make a ton of money?<p>He may be quite right though.  I&#x27;ve lost track of how often I read stories about a startup and then am absolutely gob-smacked at the number of employees they bring on.  They start a project that could be easily and competently handled by maybe 15 people, and they hire 1500.  What most of those people are doing is anyones guess, probably marketing and design work that should have been done by contracted remote-work freelancers I suppose.  They continue ignoring everything and pretending like this is 1975, like offices are something more than a gigantic drain on efficiency with no payoff.  And they plunk themselves down in Silicon Valley, paying $28000/mo to rent an efficiency apartment above a garage.  The actual WORK, the production of value, seems completely ignored next to the rush of &quot;playing the game.&quot;<p>If there is an invisible hand guiding the market, we will see &quot;companies&quot; as such evaporate eventually.  They no longer offer any value.  They used to offer almost all the value, by solving the problem of distribution, both of work to workers and product to customers.  Thanks to the Internet and software, distribution is a solved problem.  It&#x27;s nearly worthless because anyone can do it.  All that efficiency that companies could afford while standing between a worker and an end customer, skimming 90% off of every transaction between them, is going to become their death.<p>Hooking workers up with people who need the product of their work will be handled by software, putting together teams automatically, managing reputation and portfolios to provide good fits to whoever needs a team of a certain type.  Without companies there to take almost all of the value being exchanged, workers will find it only necessary to work occasionally.  The massive productivity improvements that have occurred since 1980, like a secretary going from being able to answer 20 letters a day to handling 300 emails before lunch, which were collected exclusively by the company owners and upper management will make it so terribly easy for people to make a decent living without working much.  And when people do work, they&#x27;ll do it from home because there&#x27;s simply no reason to gather them together in the same building which costs more and lowers their productivity.  For work that requires heavy tools and things of that nature, I expect people will open community workshops where people can lease workspace and equipment.<p>The industries where the service actually HAS to be carried out in person have proven fairly resistant to takeover by small numbers of large corporate concerns.  There are always independent plumbers, hairdressers, and restaurants everywhere.  Thanks to the Internet, essentially everything escapes from this need for fragile centralization.<p>Just ignore me, I grew up online in the 1990s...",1411693296

You have a device that takes some inputs and has some outputs. This device is usually modeled by a nxm matrix because it has n inputs and m outputs. From there, you want to build some other device to make sure that your original device does what you want it to do. Doing all this stuff requires linear algebra.<p>In general, linear algebra comes into play once the number of variables you're dealing with is greater than one. You mentioned that you've discovered that probability and statistics are important. Well, you'll need linear algebra to deal with that once the number of variables exceeds one.<p>Well, perhaps 'need' is too strong a word for it, but in the presence of multiple variables linear algebra is necessary as much as, say, integration for calculating the area underneath a curve.

As I step through my code with pdb, emacs opens up whatever file the current stack is in to the position in the stack.  I couldn't imagine debugging code without this.  This functionality also exists for gdb and rdb I think, I don't use those frequently.<p>compile-mode:  when I run unit tests and I get an error, compile mode lets me click or hit return on that error and instantly jump to that code in another buffer<p>shell:  emacs deals with my bash shell.  I can easily scroll up in the buffer to copy and paste output from previous commands.  I can search backwards through not just commands I have previously run, but through previous output from the shell.  When I open a file from the shell, it defaults to my current shell directory.<p>sql-mode:  gives all the goodness of emacs to an sql repl.

For mutual recursion, the compiler can generate a trampoline.<p>There are two problems with a trampoline ... one is that the stack-trace will no longer be accurate. And the second problem is that interoperability with Java suffers because the bytecode of the method or that of the call-site will be different from what-you-see in your code.<p>For example one way of doing it is to modify the recursive function ... fn (a) => b ... to be ... fn (a) => M[b] ... where M[b] contains either the returned value ""b"" or the reference + arguments of the next call done by the trampoline. And then the compiler modifies the call-sites to call the trampoline instead of our method.<p>About efficiency ... if you want to have a generic trampoline module (instead of many trampolines defined for each group ... which would consume permgen memory), you could implement such a trampoline on top of the new invokedynamic support in JDK7 ... this could allow for the call-sites in the trampoline to be cached and ultimately JITed. I'm not sure if invokedynamic could help here (I know little about how the call-sites will be cached) but I don't see why not.",1259946401

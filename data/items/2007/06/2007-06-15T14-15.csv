I could imagine a new user not understanding the one man, one vote property of the system, then being confused later when the votes seem not to have gone through.<p>Adding the visual effect of idempotency on the frontend is probably a two-second fix, anyway.",1181918579
28348,comment,27550,27600,0,0,ralph,,,"Yes, educational as you say.  node.href just returns an empty text/html document when fetched.  Does this happen synchronously or not?  What do browsers do when they're given text/html as the content of an image and what do the specs define they do?  When is ping freed?  Is it automatic when it goes out of scope and does that suggest that the image fetch is synchronous?",1181918408

It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ""fuck-you money"" at a glance.</i><p>I would say it's only depressing if you don't plan on working hard.",1181918270

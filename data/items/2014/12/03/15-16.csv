8694369,comment,8693954,8694291,0,0,thomaskcr,,,"To be fair -- taxing profit does encourage companies to spend their money.<p>Also, taxable personal income and capital gains are taxes on profit -- I don&#x27;t understand how that&#x27;s easier. Any money spent on personal needs is taxable (see &quot;The Situation&quot; who tried to say tanning was a company expense) regardless of whether a person or company spends it. You&#x27;re also able to write off business expenses whether you&#x27;re a company or a person just the same too. Income tax is really a tax on profit, not total income. It just happens that people tend to have mostly profit (since they save their money or spend it on personal needs) and for most close to 100% of their income is taxable so they assume big bad corporations are getting some advantage they aren&#x27;t entitled to which isn&#x27;t really true at all.",1417622383

8694344,comment,8692627,8693171,0,0,adrianhoward,,,"<i>&quot;A publisher recently contacted me to explore the possibility of me writing a book for them. The terms, which I believe are fairly standard, are you make about $1 for every book sold, or about 5% of the total revenue. A technical author can expect to make about $10&#x27;000 if their book sells well. The publishing house makes about $200&#x27;000 on this, with the rest going to distribution and book stores.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not directly in the publishing industry, but I&#x27;ve been a technical reviewer on several books and have a fair number of friends who are authors/editors - mostly in the non-fiction market.<p>From what I&#x27;ve experienced those publisher profit numbers don&#x27;t make sense.<p>Let&#x27;s assume 5% author royalties (which, in my experience, is the low end 5-15% is the normal range, upper end for track record very successful folk — more for some publishers in some contexts), so that $10k = $200,000 total sales for the book.<p>Typically the publisher will take around 45-55% of that $200k (including what they pass onto the author). The rest will go to distributers & retailers. Let&#x27;s take the upper end of that.<p>So 55% of $200l = $110000 to the publisher.<p>- the author royalties = $100k\n- 10% printing costs = $90k\n- 15%ish for pre-production = $75k<p>So absolute best case it&#x27;s more like $10k vs $75k. Then there&#x27;s marketing, the fact that most authors don&#x27;t earn out their advance, the shenanigans over book discount, etc. So the <i>profit</i> to publishers coming out of that is often significantly lower.<p>See <a href=""http://journal.bookfinder.com/2009/03/breakdown-of-book-costs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.bookfinder.com/2009/03/breakdown-of-book-cost...</a> and <a href=""http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-of-physical-book-publishing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-...</a> for some examples of real world publisher cost breakdowns.<p>(The slice taken by marketing in the first example above seems high from what others have told me. Its also a somewhat simplistic breakdown since it ignores some of the long-term costs from publishers that aren&#x27;t related to &quot;books&quot; directly. e.g. the advances to authors who never get published, etc. - so the potential publisher profits aren&#x27;t quite as large as they appear here - there&#x27;s other overhead outside the printing/distributing/selling books bit)<p>It&#x27;s also something Charlie Stross has posted about a fair bit see this collection of posts <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-misconceptions-about-pu-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-m...</a><p><i>&quot;Now compare to people like Brennan Dunn who have made $100&#x27;000 or more from their books, by publishing online and capturing 90%+ of revenue. You don&#x27;t need a publisher for distribution. You don&#x27;t need a publisher for typesetting. If you need an editor or proof reader you can hire one for maybe $10K.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s the best-case success case. Which is nice. But not common. Almost everybody I know who has gone the self-publishing route has ended up with the high-hundreds and single-digit-thousands.<p>They&#x27;d have got more from a publisher advance. They&#x27;d have also learned a lot more about how to write a good book from the publishers — since they&#x27;re in the business of helping their authors be profitable.<p>Is a traditional publisher the right route for everybody. No. But neither are they the rapacious idiots who are exploiting authors that some folk portray them as. Almost everybody I know who went the traditional publisher route felt they got value out of it. Many of them are more than technically literate enough to go the self publishing route if they had wanted to (and some of them have for other kinds of product/market).",1417622231

I&#x27;ve been involved with projects with all the major tech publishers in some form or another, and they&#x27;re all horrible terms (usually 12-15% of <i>proceeds</i> [i.e., post-costs] or less).<p>Even worse, they do almost no work for you these days.  The editors they find are 99% completely non-technical and on contract, so they&#x27;re just trying to squeeze hours out of reviewing something they know zilch about.  The publisher will stick your book on a website and put it in bookstores, but outside of that, don&#x27;t count on any marketing or sales help.  PROTIP: They don&#x27;t want big reputation authors because they&#x27;re better writers.  They want them so they can do minimal work and ride off the authors&#x27; social media and conference speaking coattails to sell copies with next to no investment.  Then they&#x27;ll sell your work to places like Safari for a pittance (on the order of the cost of about 100 print copies if I recall correctly) and give you as small of a piece of the pie as humanly possible.  I understand they&#x27;re a business trying to survive these days, but seriously, the whole thing needs to be re-evaluated.<p>As GP or someone said, self-publishing is way more profitable if you can find a niche that&#x27;s not being served.  I&#x27;ve made about 10x more money off my self-published works as I have my &quot;published&quot; works, and that&#x27;s a very sad statistic given how big the book industry really is.

For big tech companies usually they have a subsidiary in a given country, and that subsidiary charges the parent company for access to its work/innovations/whatever. The subsidiary does not itself receive payment for the global companies operations in that country, despite how unintuitive it is.<p>This is why the UK arms of these companies don&#x27;t make any profit - they charge the parent companies more or less at cost. Meanwhile people who want to buy their services sign a deal with the Irish subsidiary. But legally these are different companies.<p>Additionally it&#x27;s impossible to say how much profit is being made in a particular country. You can count <i>income</i> quite easily, but then what percentage of the cost of developing Facebook can be accounted to servicing the UK market? It wouldn&#x27;t make sense to allocate ALL the cost of creating Facebook to the US market and treat every other country as pure profit, as obviously there are costs involved with being international.<p>I&#x27;m not convinces Osborne has any real clue about the morass he&#x27;s wading in to here. It gets worse when you think about the possible future impact. Imagine Google and Facebook didn&#x27;t have any UK presence at the moment but were looking to hire people there, because of an abundance of skilled people in, say, London. But entering the UK suddenly means a 25% tax on their UK sourced income. Why would they ever hire the first employee? If they stay out entirely, they aren&#x27;t in UK jurisdiction so there&#x27;d be no reason for them to pay any tax there.",1417621771

The problem is that you can never actual verify how secure the proprietary solution is. So whether or not it is secure, you don&#x27;t trust it. (there are even some interesting arguments to be made about the security of any solution that deals with some kind of user input. my previous boss stipulated that the only way to have a truly secure email client is to have some third-party, verified library that takes all the input, and spits out encrypted data to whatever program deals with email servers, without the program dealing with email servers ever seeing that input in plain text form because who knows what it might do with it)<p>On the other hand as well, open source most certainly does not mean secure. I don&#x27;t even have to argue to make this point, I merely have to point out Heartbleed or Shellshock.",1417621201

Maybe that is the problem.<p>History shows hardware kept getting faster, but there has been no decrease in the amount of ever larger, slow, unreliable software.  Where is all the lean, &quot;instantaneous&quot; software running in RAM, extracting every last bit of computing power, instead of mindlessly consuming it?<p>What exactly is the point of &quot;programmmer productivity&quot; and whatever problems some programmers think that this justifies?<p>Is the point to advance computing?  The state of the art?<p>Or is the goal is to peddle their junk to those with very low expectations, not to mention those with zero expectations. (The later were not old enough, or even alive, to see how computing was done in the 80&#x27;s and hence have nothing with which to compare.)<p>It is unfortunate that giving programmers what they wanted -- faster hardware -- has not resulted in software that is any more creative or powerful, and truly it is less so, than the software of the past.

Although it&#x27;s common to hear the two values used to represent these two separate physical measurements, it&#x27;s just another case of explaining new tech (80s CDs) to old technical consumers (70s hi-fi types).  You can measure a reduction in dynamic range by reducing either sampling rate or bit length.<p>You&#x27;ll frequently find 1-bit A/Ds and D/A at > 5Mhz on high fidelity systems. That 1-bit signal is converted to/from a higher bitrate, lower sampling rate signal without loss of fidelity.  If you&#x27;re interested in looking at alternate bitrate encodings you should just look at the Super Audio CD format <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Audio_CD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Audio_CD</a><p>On your second point, I agree, we live in a noisy world and hearing 144dB of dynamic range would require serious isolation.<p>What most people should be able to hear with 90Dbs of dynamic range, are the harmonics created by undersampling a high frequency signal.  To quickly explain I&#x27;ll use a 1-bit lower frequency scenario. Lets say we have a 2Khz sine wave and a 1-bit 5Khz sampling rate. The 2Khz signal is going to be represented by a different 2 samples every cycle.  The result will be a signal that is no longer a sine wave and closer in frequency to 800Hz (wild approximation) than 2Khz.  Low pass filters are used to to keep those harmonics from being too pervasive but they still sneak into the signal near the high frequency range. Transpose this example to our current audio standard and you might realize that in order to accurately represent the high end we need a little more than 16bit 48Khz.",1417620076

8694111,comment,8688070,8692989,0,0,lmm,,,"> I think this is a type system limitation that every type describing side effects -- i.e. the core of every interesting program other than a compiler/interpreter -- can only be used in the context of a compiler/interpreter.<p>Well, to describe a side effect, you need to, uh, describe the side effect. Which requires understanding the compiler/interpreter, and a description of the things the compiler/interpreter does, expressed as machine-readable data.<p>It sounds like what you&#x27;re after is something like a standard library where all the effects are carefully enumerated? i.e. something like Haskell, but where rather than the IO &quot;sin bin&quot;, every effectful function would be very explicit about its effects? A bit like how Ada(IIRC) shipped with quite high-level concurrency operations as part of the language spec (which then lead users to reimplement low-level concurrency primitives on top of them, but maybe we can hope that history wouldn&#x27;t repeat)?<p>Some libraries are taking us in that direction, but it&#x27;s slow going. E.g. doobie seems to be gaining some momentum, as a principled way of expressing database access. Maybe in 10 years&#x27; time (if anyone is still using scala...) this will be &quot;the&quot; standard way of writing any program that uses a database, and the sort of thing that deserves to be in the standard library (whatever that means - IMO with modern dependency management tools a language standard library should only contain those primitives that need direct compiler support, anything else can be a regular library. But that&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother argument). But right now it would be very premature to say that the algebra doobie uses is the correct one. Often the appropriate interpreter for a particular problem depends on that particular problem; just as it&#x27;s good to construct your datatypes bottom-up, writing a program can feel like writing a succession of interpreters that get closer to your domain and capture more of the laws - basic Haskell gives you &quot;thing that does any kind of I/O&quot;, then you have a library for &quot;thing that sends complete messages to sockets&quot;, a higher-level library on top of that for &quot;thing that does database operations&quot;, and so on.<p>And honestly standardization isn&#x27;t that important, as long as the language makes it easy to let your code handle it generically. Doobie itself allows a couple of different implementations for your lower-level effect-capturing monad (scalaz Task, IO), or allows you to provide a simple adapter. So if two libraries use the equivalent of a different checker, a different &quot;type system&quot;, that&#x27;s not really any worse than e.g. two C++ libraries using two different String classes - that is to say, it&#x27;s annoying, but not impossible to work with. User-level code can do the same thing - I&#x27;ve got a generic &quot;report&quot; process that can use a doobie database call, an async call to a web service, or something else. As and when the community reaches a consensus on the right way to express a particular kind of effect, I&#x27;d expect more higher-level libraries to standardize on that. But in the meantime, as long as types are first-class values and you can manipulate them as easy as any other values (which these kind of languages get you), multiple &quot;type systems&quot; are no more of a problem to work with than multiple types.",1417619911

For which the answer is given.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not claiming 24-bit end-user audio has merits, of which I have little opinion. I&#x27;m just pointing out the flaw in the proposed experiment.<p><i>If you feed 24-bit input to headphones, there&#x27;s no guarantee that the speakers are performing with 24-bit resolution.</i><p>Not sure if you&#x27;re just imprecise in your language here or if you&#x27;re genuinely confusing things. Speaker-elements, as found in both speakers and headphones are analogue. They operate according to the law of physics, and respond to changes in magnetic fields, for which there is practically no lower limit.<p>They have no digital resolution. A quick example: Take your 16-bit music, halve the volume and voila! You are now operating at &quot;17-bit resolution&quot;. Halve it again. 18-bit resolution. Etc.<p>There&#x27;s probably some minimum levels of accuracy, yes, but it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to measure it in bits.<p>If you&#x27;re aware of this and were just trying to adjust the language to the problem at hand, I&#x27;m sorry for being patronizing, but I just wanted to make sure we keep things factual here.",1417619018

8694033,comment,8693990,8693990,0,0,valarauca1,,,"The rule of thumb that most people stick with when doing OOP is duplicate code is bad.<p>The goal is to find data that needs to be grouped, and group it. Find functions that only use that grouped data, and stick them in classes.<p>For example a query can be an object. I.E.: A database connection (in java)<p><pre><code>       public class DBconnect\n       {\n               private connection Con = null;\n\n               public DBconnect(String Ip, int port)\n               {\n                        this.connection = mkConnection(ip, port);\n               }\n\n                public Object query(String query)\n                {\n                          return this.connection.ExecQuery(query);\n                }\n         }\n</code></pre>\nThen you query specific pre-processing code can be added directly into the query.<p><pre><code>                 public String query(String query, String regex)\n                 {\n                         return this.connection.ExecQuery(query).replaceAll(regex, &quot;&quot;);\n                 }\n</code></pre>\nWhich results in code like<p><pre><code>                  DBConnect db = new DBConnect(127.0.0.1, 150);\n                  String[] quereies = { &quot;yada&quot;, &quot;yada&quot;, yada&quot;};\n                  for(String str: queries)\n                  {\n                         String result = db.query(str, &quot;\\s+&quot;);\n                         doDataScience(result);\n                  }\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know if this helps. But its a suggestion.<p>P.S.: I&#x27;ve been spending my free nights the past 2 weeks trying to throw together a javascript based data processing engine in java. It should be mostly workable by the weekend. I could throw it on a ShowHN if you&#x27;d be interested.",1417618876

You face two huge hurdles: a very thin atmosphere (average surface pressure 0.6% of Earth&#x27;s) and low gravity, which sounds great until you consider the correlated long-term health problems.<p>Even if we could somehow import massive amounts of air and water to Mars, it would rapidly evaporate away and be lost to space. We may be able to establish science stations on Mars in some kind of pressurized air-tight dome habitats, but colonization, particularly independent colonization, is practically inconceivable for the foreseeable future. Mars is simply not suited at all to human life, and the problems with Mars are not something that can be fixed with any terraforming that doesn&#x27;t involve somehow adding 2/3rds of Earth&#x27;s mass to the planet and somehow recreating a magnetosphere.",1417618833

Also ventures based around getting big partnerships (e.g. licensing deals) may require the prestige of VC backing before you can get through the door.<p>Secondly you might have an option of growing organically for 3 years and hoping that no one else enters the market and that its still buoyant in that time or growing fast with VC support. I am not saying it's not possible to grow fast without VCs but I am sure it helps. I think it just comes down to what business it is.

I&#x27;d be interested to explore to understand what the limitation is and how I (or others) might approach it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with all of your comments.<p>I find that services are relatively essential building blocks for my applications.<p>Providers are there so that you can preconfigure your modules. It&#x27;s a legitimate use case. Take Restangular, for example - it&#x27;s so useful to you because it&#x27;s a provider that you can configure for your app.<p>I can see how $rootScope could be perceived as code smell but after examining how angular uses it internally I&#x27;m ok with the way I use it.<p>Directives are confusing the first time you see them. You need to see a few examples. Though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem with the api for declaring them. There&#x27;s a lot to configure - it&#x27;s mostly optional, but you may well need all of it eventually.<p>Angular gives you a framework to build on. You can create really amazing components that are totally reusable on your other projects. Sometimes they come in the form of directives, sometimes they&#x27;re other types of module. Often when you start abstracting that out you&#x27;ll need to get a bit closer to the metal. Angular provides an api for you to work with in those cases and it&#x27;s ok to take advantage of that.",1385463307

It&#x27;s a freemium webapp for reading texts and watching videos. So far I have 2800 signed up users, 70 of whom are paying a $9.99/year subscription.<p>My marketing strategy so far has consisted of:<p>- Blog feature updates (http://blog.readlang.com)<p>- Occasional tweets (https://twitter.com/Readlang)<p>- An intro video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntVQ2L5s6FI) and tutorial screencasts (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I10qWoQEi5U&list=PLIGa-eWCssj9K_PpNGLnIs8vcENanVx3_)<p>- Posting to How-to-learn-any-language forum (http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=35462&PN=2) and Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1m5ymj/short_demo_video_of_readlang_my_webapp_for/)<p>- Uservoice page (https://readlang.uservoice.com/)<p>- Emailing every user, and being responsive to any requests<p>Apart from the above, I&#x27;ve relied on word of mouth, with enthusiastic users blogging and sharing it.<p>People advise me that I should do more marketing. But I feel uncomfortable spending more time than I already do on this stuff. My instinct is to just make the product awesome and let it market itself. I enjoy announcing new features, but it feels like having a prominent presence on online communities and social media to spread a product requires more effort than I&#x27;m willing to spend.<p>Perhaps I need to find a partner to help out with marketing and community management, perhaps there are more efficient ways that I can manage this myself, perhaps I need to integrate vitality into the product somehow, or perhaps I should just carry on as I have been.

6800381,comment,6798873,6798873,3,0,shubb,,,"The problem with 23andmMe is that genetics can&#x27;t currently tell us much about our risk of developing common genetic diseases.<p>Some diseases are caused by a single gene. These are rare because people with a dominant copy of that gene are less likely to reproduce, so they are mostly deselected. Many of these monogenic diseases have a pretty major effect. You know if you have them (and probably died in childhood). Pre-natal genetic counseling is where finding these is useful.<p>Most of the diseases 23andMe talks about are caused by multiple genes (in combination with the environment). The interactions between these genes are often really complicated, and typically the number of genes involved is huge (and the actual contribution of each gene to risk is very small). This has made investigation a nightmare - even the most understood genetic diseases, we only know about say 10-20% of the genes that make up the genetic part of the risk, which may only be 40% of the total risk.<p>So 23andMe sees you have 1 of the 100 genes that we identified as contributing to a disease. That means you have 1% of 20% of 40%, which is really nothing to get excited about.<p>I know 23andMe tries to communicate this, but they are also trying to run a buisness. If they stood up and said &#x27;yeah, we can do some tests, and they really won&#x27;t tell you anything worth knowing&#x27;, they would get no press coverage. But anything else is... carefully not lying, rather than being honest.<p>I read other commenters here, who say things like &#x27;Well it&#x27;s a nice compliment to getting a blood test&#x27;, and get the feeling they think these tests mean shit.",1385463106
6800380,comment,6799332,6800209,1,0,vidarh,,,"I can&#x27;t think of any good books of the top of my head - I&#x27;ve picked this up largely from starting out with assembly, and spending years picking apart compiler output (initially because the C compilers I had access to were junk, and I more than once would compile something, disassemble it and then hand-optimise the result...)<p>One approach is to learn to read assembly (being able to write it from scratch is optional), and understand what affects clock cycle count. On modern architectures that also means understanding cache effects, and particularly looking out for memory access patterns. Then look at lots of disassembly and learn to understand what kind of code typically gets generated from your C. Often it will be plain obvious why things are slow when you see the amount of generated code (though here be dragons - sometimes modern compilers will actually do a good job optimising, and as a result produce code that no sane human would ever write manually).<p>You can quickly get a good feel for patterns that are good and bad.<p>But in general:<p>- Profile. Profile some more, to make sure you&#x27;re actually spending your time on the code that matters.<p>- A useful rule of thumb is that for any given algorithm, the fewer function calls and memory accesses, the better it is likely to to be. Functions calls are expensive, and often (not always) reduce locality of code, and so increase the amount of time spent accessing memory that is not in cache (== expensive). But don&#x27;t start hand-unrolling/removing abstractions until you <i>know</i> by profiling that the code in question is performance critical, or you may just end up creating a maintenance nightmare.<p>- System calls are particularly nasty on any memory protected modern OS. The context switch overhead tends to be absolutely brutal. Which means it&#x27;s very often worth quickly breaking out strace (on Linux) or equivalents to quickly eyeball the system call behaviour of applications before spending much time on other stuff. E.g. one particular pet peeve of mine is the amount of time you see read() or write() with small byte counts - if that occurs often, you can sometimes get truly massive speedups simply by changing the code to do non-blocking read/writes to/from a buffer and do smaller read/write&#x27;s in user space from those buffers. (Always be suspicious of code that does read/write/recv/send or similar unless you can see it uses large-ish buffers... but profile). My experience is that odds are shockingly high that people will severely underestimate the cost of system calls.<p>- Keep data that is accessed together close in memory. E.g. cluster values by access patterns when you can, to avoid thrashing cache when you access the data. This can be tricky, and the solutions can be non-obvious because the actual access patterns may not be that easy to spot.",1385463092

I have the firm belief that Education is about encouraging curiosity and providing the tools to deal with the unforeseen outcomes of said curiosity. I also have this (possibly crazy) idea that advertising, while I personally often dislike its general commercial use, will eventually be but a step in the intelligent distribution of information.<p>The idea would be to create a form of knowledge advertising network that arouses curiosity. In very much the same way usual online ads work, it would show users banners (as an example) containing a snippet of information relevant to the page they&#x27;re visiting, their general activity and so on. Weight would be added where people take interest and as they encounter and use those &quot;ads&quot; more and more the ads would become more targetted. For instance, your first ad could be about &quot;Metals&quot;, then if you seem interested, the next ones could revolve around, say, the physics involved with metals, and so on.<p>While I&#x27;m talking about advertising, I&#x27;d like to be clear that in no way would I want this to be commercial. I&#x27;m thinking the information could be extracted from Wikipedia, and as far as the advertising algorithms go, I&#x27;m hoping someone more qualified in the subject might be able to point to some good libraries out there, ideally open-source. The whole thing would also ideally be on an opt-in basis, with websites using the system hopefully sharing the load of this advertising network.<p>I highly respect the opinion of many here on HN and I&#x27;d like to know your thoughts.",1385461941

It&#x27;s the same now in Computer Science, there are so many places where theoretical assumptions might deviate from reality that having a proof is not enough. In fact, you have to have those assumptions to make things mathematically tractable. Imagine mathematicians or computer scientists re-proving real analysis theorems using floating point arithmetic...<p>In other words, your vision of proofs being enough as long as all the assumptions are part of the theory, seems utopian to me.

I could spend the next 3 months interviewing with other startups and collect data points, but I'm thinking there's got to be a smarter (and faster) way.  Therefore, if anyone can offer any advice on what's the market price for a strong mid level developer at a VC funded ~10 employee startup nowadays, that would greatly help me out.<p>In fact, the only part I'm concerned about is the equity offer.  Right now I'm being offered ~.5%.  Is that even in the correct ballpark for a company of this size?<p>Sorry if I'm breaking any unspoken laws or courtesies by asking a question like this, but it's one of the few ways to get context for my offer within 48 hours...<p>Thanks!<p>Will Qian\nwwq222@gmail.com",1198920410

I am willing to hope that dynamic typing will make for more fun languages, although I am very used to code completion by now (which is inherently impossible with dynamic typing, I think). Sometimes I wonder if the dynamic typing advocates are just the genius people, the same ones who can also remember the syntax of UNIX shell commands by heart.<p>If the dynamic languages fail me, I guess Scala might be worth a look.",1198918893

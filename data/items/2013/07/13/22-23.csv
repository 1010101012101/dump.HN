6039126,comment,6037464,6037464,6,0,Mikeb85,,,"We need posts like this for every language.  Nowadays, thanks to the open-source culture, the ease of sharing and installing libraries, you can do just about anything with any language.<p>You can run a start-up on Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, C#, Haskell, OCaml, Clojure, Common Lisp, C++, etc...  Programmer familiarity with language semantics and tools is likely going to make a bigger difference than the language itself.<p>Google runs on Python/Java/C++, Facebook runs on PHP/C++, Twitter on Scala/Ruby, and a number of large sites run on all sorts of other crazy languages.<p>Hearing about the pros of Perl from a Perl programmer is nice, even though I&#x27;m not particularly fond of Perl.  I&#x27;m personally building apps in Clojure, because I like Lisps, Clojure has great features and a great environment, and it just suits the way I like to think about problems.  I think it&#x27;s the best language ever, but I also understand why people would think the same about Ruby, Python, Scala, JS, etc...<p>I think some people make too much out of posts like this, yes he thinks Perl is the best language, and it probably is for him.  At the very least, he gives compelling reasons for Perl programmers to continue in Perl, and not feel like they &#x27;need&#x27; to switch to Python or Ruby...",1373756250

I get sad because ideas come from experience. Not technical experience (although that&#x27;s a good source too), but <i>life</i> experience. Snowboarding. Working a part time job. Doing Krav Maga. Working for a huge, ugly corporate. Each of these is the source of an awesome idea I have (I have seven that have legs).<p>Here&#x27;s one of them. Go talk to a !good! DTP guy at a media company like Ogilvy[1]. Ask him or her about the conflict of interest between the sales guy, the artist, and the DTP guy. And then think about a SaaS job-card workflow system for media houses that uses labels for tagging jobs, tracks changes to EVERYTHING, including hours spent on a job per person and job stage, provides an audit trail, and approvals process. These guys have serious pain. I&#x27;ve got a conceptual architecture I&#x27;m happy to share.<p>[1] I choose Ogilvy in particular for two reasons - first obviously, because I know a good DTP guy at Ogilvy. Second, because they&#x27;re one of the largest media houses in the world, and <i>still</i> have problems with something as simple as getting a print ad campaign out the door for say, British Airways.",1373756185

Much like police protect one another, employees of some district attorneys are expected to cover these violations as an almost routine matter.<p>As prosecutors enjoy almost absolute judicial immunity, the regulations in the Rules of Professional Conduct are all that provide for sanctions in case of a violation. This measure has proved rather toothless as many state ethics boards, often composed of former prosecutors, are reluctant to issue sanctions.<p>Even in the most egregious violation of the Brady rule that I have seen, which occurred during the Duke lacrosse team case when ex-DA Nifong hid an exculpatory DNA report, the state ethics bar did not issue sanctions for that violation.<p>Credentials: I am not a lawyer, but I have worked as a paralegal for several years and captained a mock trial team for both high school and college.

But, if you are buying the parts used to build said servers?   generally speaking, the lowest price on the internet is pretty close to the real lowest price.<p>This is the primary reason why I do my own assembly;  assembling computers is way easier than negotiating Dell down to a reasonable price.<p>So yeah;  this is starting to shape what businesses I want to get into.    I mean, co-location only has margin if you own the building.   (I&#x27;m working on that part, but I don&#x27;t have an ETA.)  - so yeah, if the &#x27;owning the building&#x27; deal doesn&#x27;t work out... well, I&#x27;m not going to dump existing customers, but I am not taking more at the moment.",1373753740

5878770,comment,5876108,5876734,9,0,grey-area,,,"There have been several leaks from Snowdon, they are not limited to a single slide deck. I find it curious just how vitriolic you are on this single issue (direct access). We simply don&#x27;t know the full story on PRISM or the other associated programs, we don&#x27;t know how much of what the Google statement was true in a broad sense, and how much was simply legally true in a narrow sense. I would be very interested to know the real process (as would everyone here), as it could vary from highly automated with legal assistants clicking &#x27;send all data&#x27; 100 times a day at the Google end without having sufficient information to actually check requests, to highly manual, with teams of lawyers assessing every request carefully with full information (though given the cavalier treatment of Congress by the NSA, I highly doubt this). However, I don&#x27;t think it matters too much at present - what matters far more is the extensive and intrusive surveillance that the NSA feels it can pursue without informed congressional oversight rather than the details of one specific program.<p>What we do know is:<p>Snowdon leaked slides showing a Boundless informant program to catalogue data - almost 3 billion records collected over the month of March 2013 just from US sources - that&#x27;s a huge amount of data for an agency that doesn&#x27;t have a remit to surveill Americans.<p>Every phone call in the US is now being recorded by the NSA - that is almost the biggest story here, since we don&#x27;t know if they also tap email headers, which would probably be worse.<p>Oversight of the NSA and other agencies is impotent, and most of congress simply wasn&#x27;t aware of even the broad scope of the surveillance, let alone details.<p>DNI Clapper lied to congress with impunity over surveillance of Americans, the NSA lied over not having counts of records.<p>The NSA&#x27;s standards are incredibly lax (allowing this leak to happen - he shouldn&#x27;t have reached the front door with this data), and their interpretation of their remit worryingly broad (extending to collecting  at least phone (and probably more) metadata on every single American and company). If the IT tech Snowdon had access to all this data, other countries probably have it already by other means.<p>Snowdon leaked slides on PRISM claiming &#x27;collection directly from the servers&#x27; - this was presented by Greenwald and the Guardian as a claim to be verified and contrasted with Google&#x27;s denial of direct access (I feel both are probably true - the slide in a broad sense, and Google in a narrow sense). The quotemarks in Guardian articles are there to attribute, not to undermine the content quoted.<p>Snowdon claims to have had access to anyone&#x27;s email at providers like Google without obstruction at his relatively high clearance level (unverified) - I think he wanted to point out the lack of supervision of the process (hence ref. to president&#x27;s personal email), and the lack of interaction with Google staff - the truth of this claim has yet to be tested and various important points (how quickly, what supervision, what sort of data etc) are elided. I&#x27;d like to hear more from Snowdon and Greenwald (or the US gov) on this.<p>If you are truly interested in all the issues raised by these leaks, you should address those very real and serious topics, not minor quibbles over whether a journalist&#x27;s interpretation of the technical details of a transfer of records is correct. I can see why people might have jumped to conclusions over &#x27;direct access&#x27;, and do feel it&#x27;s important to get to the bottom of the real process (I&#x27;m sure Google would love to tell if only to put the wilder theories to bed), but the reality without that is bad enough - given the many other programs we know about, and the admitted details of PRISM/FISA requests. I was a bit dishearted by the initial Google response but am pleased they are now pressuring the government to release figures for FISA requests, so that people can see the extent of the program as it impacts Google, but this issue is about more than Google and Facebook and records they might return on the basis of FISA requests. That would help define the scope of <i>one</i> of the many programs.<p>That reality of broad surveillance without adequate supervision is enough to put people off doing business in the US or hosting data there, and the acknowledged facts are enough to make it very easy for an unscrupulous president like Nixon to turn the US into a surveillance state and capture all the levers of power very quickly - something that should worry all American citizens. <i>That</i> is what Snowdon was warning against (see the last part of his video), and that is the most insidious part of this sort of widespread surveillance unchecked by public law and public courts - not how it is used today, but what it might enable if it is allowed to continue.",1371196190

5878696,comment,5877853,5877853,22,0,rl3,,,"The article conducts a fairly scrupulous analysis of what politicians and officials are saying, and likely is correct in its assertions. However, it doesn&#x27;t mention (within the same post) that the NSA has been operating DPI gear at the carrier level for a long time now. Mainstream media has overlooked this fact more often than not recently.<p>DPI sitting on carrier pipes is what the Room 641A scandal in 2006 was about. Its disclosure helped kick off the warrantless wiretap debate we&#x27;re currently having. Virtually every NSA whistleblower since has mentioned the operation of Narus devices.<p>Consider the following:<p>A) NSA is confirmed to be operating Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices on internet backbone fiber-optic cables within the United States, with telecom cooperation.<p>B) The recent revelation that Verizon has been providing NSA call metadata and routing information (but not content) on a massive scale. Obviously not just Verizon, but every major telco.<p>C) Construction of NSA&#x27;s Bluffdale, Utah data storage facility is almost complete. The storage capacity varies depending on who you ask, but most conservative estimates put it at a scale such that it can hold the entirety of the world&#x27;s communications well into the foreseeable future.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science they&#x27;re already intercepting and storing the content of traffic. The Verizon metadata and routing information is certainly used in conjunction with DPI for attribution and deduplication of intercepted traffic.<p>It&#x27;s a simple matter of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.<p>---<p>Except the number of operands is more likely in the double digits. If I may indulge in speculation and conduct some quotation analysis of my own:<p>OP&#x27;s article cites many officials hinting that what we currently know, even in light of the recent debate, is only the tip of the iceberg. However, in my opinion the foremost quote in this regard occurred seven years ago:<p>In 2006, Russel Tice, NSA whistleblower, was quoted as saying:<p>&quot;In my case, there&#x27;s no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should be public ever, unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify them.&quot; [1]<p>OK, 200 years is probably a bit of an embellishment, especially if you listen to Singularity folks who suggest the human race won&#x27;t even be the human race by then.<p>However, Tice explicitly mentioned this in context of a &quot;different angle&quot; from the warrantless intercept operations just seeing the light of day at the time. [2]<p>If he wasn&#x27;t even talking about what&#x27;s currently being debated in the media, then what was he referring to?<p>My guess would be something on the analysis side of the equation. Perhaps collection and subsequent analysis of mobile device geolocation data.<p>Imagine employing the technique of geofencing on individual citizens at a national or even global scale. Non-targeted individuals entering within a certain radius of targeted individuals at sufficiently similar velocity for a specific duration or frequency could end up drawing suspicion upon themselves. Combined with other data points, individuals who are societal outliers in terms of behavior could be detected with ease.<p>Or, maybe it&#x27;s that and more. There&#x27;s all sorts of enterprise-class big data simulation products out there where you can simulate an environment in extremely fine-grained fashion using a near-unfathomable amount of data points.<p>--<p>TL;DR - The notion that NSA isn&#x27;t getting everything is laughable. Comprehensive, retroactive surveillance is already a reality.<p>---<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2006/07/10/hoekstra_blows_the_whistle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2006/07/10/hoekstra_blow...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/security/2006/05/12/5319/more-unlawful-activity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/security/2006/05/12/5319/more-unlaw...</a>",1371194152

5878663,comment,5869121,5872244,1,0,gfodor,,,"I posted it above but just to re-iterate if iOS 7 ships where background images render the status bar, text, etc, unreadable due to an obvious &quot;white on white&quot; or &quot;black on black&quot; issue, or at least if this isn&#x27;t somehow addressed otherwise, then I will (figurtively :)) eat my hat.<p>I&#x27;d argue most of my beef with the armchair commentators is they are making what appear to be deep criticisms of iOS 7 without having actually used it, and without taking into account the fact that it&#x27;s beta 1. They are shipping a new &quot;letterpress&quot; text treatment in UIKit, my guess is that they will apply this treatment to text if it is sitting on top of a similar-colored background, but probably have not worked out the details yet. I could see it being a reasonable technical and design challenge since you may need to apply a treatment to only <i>part</i> of a glyph. I&#x27;d ask the poster what their &quot;duh, so obvious&quot; solution is to their &quot;duh, so obvious&quot; observation. (Note: &quot;leave the status bar alone&quot; is not a valid answer here, since the design <i>goal</i> is to have the content in iOS 7 take up the entire screen. If you have a problem with <i>that</i> decision, argue that point, but realize it has nothing to do with status bars anymore. Even if Apple left this pretty glaring flaw in their design, they may have decided to do so because having content take up the entire screen is worth this cost, and the onus is on the critic to explain why it is not worth it, not that they are too stupid to have noticed this edge case.)<p>Basically if you see something and it&#x27;s something that 99% of <i>developers</i> would identify as a potential edge case, you can be sure Apple considered it too and at least made an explicit design decision to deal with it or punt for later betas. If they made an explicit design decision, which is assumed, then you should try to understand that decision and then critique <i>that decision and its tradeoffs</i> beyond Comic-Book-Guy-esque &quot;this is so obvious they are so dumb how could they miss my clever edge case I&#x27;ve discovered.&quot; Let&#x27;s say Apple really <i>do</i> see that white on white is an issue, and actually decided to leave it that way and ignore the case altogether. Why would they do this? At least address this question if you are going to critique the design. The OP assumes it was an <i>oversight</i>, not a <i>design decision</i> or <i>technical debt</i>, which is kind of insulting to Apple designers and engineers.<p>I would prefer if before starting a complaint about text legibility, colors, contrast, and so on, if people would include a disclaimer of if they have actually based their opinions upon viewing the design on an actual device.",1371193584

Now, if you get arrested, but they drop the charges when you go to court, that implies that somebody in the system - possibly a cop - made a mistake.

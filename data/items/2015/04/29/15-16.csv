9459215,comment,9456935,9458936,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"As a commodity good with a physical presence, gold is traceable in the sense that it leaves evidence of its passage.  The boat that carries it has a deeper draft, and burns slightly more fuel as a result, for instance.  Even the &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; method works; it isn&#x27;t necessary to follow the gold if you can find the dump trucks.  Obviously, there is an upper limit to the amount of gold you can move without anyone noticing it.<p>Bits traversing networks are more traceable, but they are less identifiable.  An encrypted packet passing through my home router could be a fraction of a family photo, or it could be a transfer of $1M worth of dark currency.

No, your management experience of managing your highschool robotics team is not relevant at a fortune 500 company. Related to this is the problem with college admissions.

Or was that crushed before hand too?<p>What you&#x27;re suggesting is very, very implausible and so I wouldn&#x27;t say that comparing it to something supernatural is all that mocking.  The point is that rational people don&#x27;t know everything about the world and to 100% discount the supernatural is pretty arrogant.  But I think the odds that there was a two-factor injury to this guy are about the same as the odds that God snapped his neck.

I am working on iOS version, after that TextNut will support icloud and dropbox.<p>* WYSIWYG - I believe this why TextNut is unique with others, it does not mix markdown delimiter with content, also provide a way to switch between markdown and rich mode<p>* Ulysses - unfortunately, after a few version upgrade, its UI more like Ulysses. Although I prefer you say I &quot;rip-off&quot; from Apple Mail most. Actually, I inherit most ideas from geniuswiki that I made since 2007. (That is why the link, image, footnote using curly bracket { to open popover!)\nI checked in first line code of TextNut in early of 2011, but I stopped only after very roughly UI code <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDxHr19UIAEVArE.png:large"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDxHr19UIAEVArE.png:large</a>.  Although UI looks more different with current, but basic design idea never be changed since then, 3 panes: doc tree, editor, help(was call `Macro` from geniuswiki), doc title is updated by content, etc.  I restarted TextNut dev since the middle of last year, I got a out-sourcing UI designer and give my first version design <a href=""http://www.textnutwriter.com/img/1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textnutwriter.com/img/1.png</a>. After I add Theme in 1.1 version, I set the default theme as current light grey as it can accepted by most writers.  In latest 2.1 version, Tree structure doc tree is supported, then final version looks like current. As independent developer, I only invest very small amount money for UI design. I hope users can more focus on core functionalities rather than colour palette at early stage.",1430322847

9459165,comment,9456190,9458483,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There is a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma aspect to office politics: the more time you spend learning the politics of an organization, the more effective you will be within that organization, but the more time that <i>everyone</i> in the organization spends politicking, the less effective the organization will be as a whole.  At some critical point, the organization collapses inwards on itself and becomes unable to react to changing market conditions, and goes out of business.  That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s resistance to teaching or even making people aware of politics: eventually it results in the destruction of <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> jobs.<p>There&#x27;s another game you can play, which is to find organizations (or parts of organizations) where there is a minimum amount of politics to begin with.  These are usually younger, high-growth companies filling a real need in the marketplace; because everyone&#x27;s so busy delivering value to the customer, they don&#x27;t have time to compete with each other, nor do they need to because the pie&#x27;s expanding faster than anyone can gobble up a piece of it.  As Eric Schmidt liked to say, &quot;More revenue solves all known problems.&quot;<p>The problem with personally optimizing for office-politics is that now you have a big comparative advantage over other employees, <i>but only in high-politics workplaces</i>.

Most other places see their mission primarily in terms of either entertainment or influence.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just old, but keeping those sources for news and following a diversity of people--including a number of mainstream media print reporters and several academics, particularly economists--on Twitter to get personal views of events and ideas seems to be working OK.<p>With regard to &quot;new content&quot;, there are only a few new ideas in the world.

Keyboard and trackpad work surprisingly well (and is highly underrated... other manufacturers are going to have a really hard time getting this right on devices this thin... use one in a store if you haven&#x27;t). Screen is great. Battery life is as expected. Size is obviously incredible. CPU performance is as expected (1.1) or slightly above (1.3, which is the one I have, is actually fairly fast). It&#x27;s a superb machine.<p>As far as actual use, well that depends on who is using it. The role that this laptop fits really well IMO is use as a secondary device for consistently mid-level computing tasks (with some burst activity) in an environment where mobility is important. &quot;webdev work while traveling&quot; is exactly this role so as long as you are OK with the form factor then you will like this laptop. If the form factor is an issue, you should consider the Air. If power is an issue, you should consider the Pro. If price is an issue, look at other manufacturers (new Surface and new XPS are both great machines, for example, though neither are really that cheap).<p>The reviews on this device have been mixed but I think a lot of reviews are acting on the premise that it&#x27;s a one-stop machine, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not perfect. It&#x27;s a bit pricey. You aren&#x27;t going to be running a new game at max settings on it. The one port thing is odd and you will need to wait for the adapter market to catch up for some of this oddness/clumsiness to disappear. 8 gig ram isn&#x27;t quite enough if you are expecting to be running big VMs on it a lot. The CPU is relatively underpowered (though, honestly, I think this is overrated and the 1.3 in particular is quite good... even with the 1.1 you will likely never even notice).<p>For me, this device is replacing a 13&quot; 2011 Air and so far I consider it to be superior in just about every way and my experience has been great. If I need to sit down and do some &quot;serious&quot; computing for a decent stretch of time (new game at max settings for a couple hours, large data crunching, long programming stretch where I really need a desk and several monitors) then, well, that&#x27;s what my desktop is for (or a powerful, bulky, docked laptop which amounts to the same thing).<p>In other words, what you are buying when you buy this machine over something else is this: the keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the efficiency of the CPU, the battery form factor, the fanless design, and the entire form factor to bring this all together in such a tiny laptop. In return, the tradeoff is slightly less RAM, slightly less CPU power, and a lack of extension ports.",1430321516

9459006,comment,9452379,9453570,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"Consider an analogy to booleans. We can <i>get</i> a boolean in many different ways (&#x27;true&#x27;/&#x27;false&#x27; constants, numeric comparisons, etc.). We can only <i>use</i> a boolean in one way: selecting the branch of an if/then/else construct. All logical connectives, (de)serialisers, conversions, etc. and everything other &#x27;users&#x27; of booleans that a language may have built-in can all be replaced using combinations of if/then/else. More formally, we could say that booleans have many <i>introduction rules</i> but only one <i>elimination rule</i> (if/then/else)[1].<p>We can easily remove booleans from a language by combining introduction and elimination into one step. In other words, we can replace introduction/elimination combos like this:<p><pre><code>    bool b = lessThan(x, y);\n    if (b) { foo; } else { bar; }\n</code></pre>\nWith a single construct, like this:<p><pre><code>    ifLessThan(x, y) { foo; } else { bar; }\n</code></pre>\nWe can do this to every boolean introduction rule; in particular, if we do it to the constants &#x27;true&#x27; and &#x27;false&#x27; we end up with a form of the &quot;Church booleans&quot;[2]:<p><pre><code>    ifTrue  { i_will_always_run; } else { i_will_never_run;  }\n\n    ifFalse { i_will_never_run;  } else { i_will_always_run; }\n</code></pre>\nIf we think about first-order programs, what effect does this transformation have? It brings together the <i>reason</i> for a decision with the <i>consequences</i> of that decision. In other words, to use &#x27;ifLessThan&#x27; we must have the numbers (&#x27;x&#x27; &#x27;y&#x27;) which &#x27;do the choosing&#x27; <i>and</i> the branches (&#x27;foo&#x27; &#x27;bar&#x27;) which get chosen, <i>at the same time</i>.<p>What if we inspect the stacks of these programs? They will always show us the <i>reason</i> for branches being taken! We&#x27;re never just in the branch of an &#x27;if&#x27; construct: we&#x27;re in the branch of an &#x27;ifLessThan&#x27; construct, and we can see what the numbers were; or an &#x27;ifEqual&#x27; branch; or an &#x27;ifPhaseOfTheMoon&#x27; branch; or whatever. In other words, to paraphrase your complaint about monadic IO, <i>booleans erase all context</i>!<p>In a language with booleans, we can write a complex, deep calculation which returns a boolean; then we can use that boolean elsewhere. Reasoning about such programs is incredibly difficult, since all of the stack information built up during our complex calculation is thrown away once it returns; by the time we hit a problem <i>using</i> the boolean, we know nothing about it other than &#x27;true&#x27;/&#x27;false&#x27; (this is also related to the idea of &quot;boolean blindness&quot;[3]).<p>This same argument can actually be applied to <i>every</i> data type (numbers, lists, etc.).<p>So, why do languages use booleans? Because <i>despite</i> these problems, this ability to split up reasons from consequences can be very useful too! It lets reify decisions into concrete values. We can manipulate these values with an intuitive, high-level algebra (AND/OR/NOT/etc.). It lets us separate <i>how</i> we make decisions from <i>what</i> those decisions are. As long as these decisions are given descriptive variable names like &quot;queue_is_empty&quot;, and we avoid the temptation to collapse everything together with logical connectives, then we can still reason effectively: &quot;we got here because the queue was empty&quot;.<p>In a language without booleans, we can regain this power using higher-order functions (passing branches around as variables); or we can write first-order boilerplate to model the same thing. But why bother when we can just use booleans?<p><i>Exactly</i> the same argument can be applied to reified (&#x27;monadic&#x27;) IO. The core idea is to represent IO actions as data, just like booleans represent decisions. Just like with booleans, this lets us separate <i>how</i> we decide on actions from <i>what</i> those actions are. Likewise, we can use (more or less) intuitive, high-level algebras to manipulate these values. Monads are one example of an algebra for doing this; applicatives, effects and arrows are other algebras we could use instead. Note that we can also manipulate boolean <i>values</i> using algebras other than &quot;boolean algebra&quot;; eg. as a ring.<p>Yes, we lose the context of what caused an action to be decided on; but it&#x27;s exactly the same as losing the context of what caused a boolean to be true/false. The &quot;solution&quot; is the same in both cases too: look at how it was <i>produced</i>, not how it&#x27;s used.<p>Booleans are either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, not matter which operations went into their construction. We can&#x27;t &#x27;inspect&#x27; a boolean to recover whether it &#x27;contains&#x27; &#x27;AND&#x27;s/&#x27;OR&#x27;s/&#x27;other booleans&#x27;, etc. Likewise, trying to &#x27;inspect&#x27; an IO action to recover whether it &#x27;contains&#x27; &#x27;PrintLn&#x27;s/&#x27;open&#x27;s/etc. is just as futile and defeats the point of IO actions.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re recreating/rebuilding things to work with IO actions then you&#x27;re DoingItWrong(TM). Trying to, for example, look for a &quot;println&quot; call &#x27;inside&#x27; an IO action is like trying to look for an &quot;OR(x < 5, ...)&quot; call &#x27;inside&#x27; a boolean.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction#Introduction_and_elimination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction#Introduction_...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_Booleans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_Booleans</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blindness/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-bli...</a>",1430321471

First, brighter-hat modders abandon the franchise to make mods to some other game that allows mods.  Second, darker-hat modders crack the game, restore the modding capability, and distribute mod-enabling patches or pre-loaders for every official release.  The black-hats will simply distribute pirated pre-patched copies, with pre-loaded mods.<p>Thanks to NexusMods, much of what I actually see when I play Skyrim has actually been created by other end users.  This includes the &quot;killer app&quot; of mods, which involves the physics engine and more detailed model skeletons.  You know which one I&#x27;m talking about.  Jiggle, jiggle.  The studio probably couldn&#x27;t create half of those mods and still sell the game on console platforms.  They would either bump up against resource constraints on the device or licensing restrictions on content (lookin&#x27; at you for this one, Nintendo).<p>The ability to mod is almost intrinsic to any game where the physics and rendering engine is separated from the content.  The only question is whether that content-loader is exposed in any meaningful way to the end user.  Even Doom had its WADs.  Unless you&#x27;re willing to completely break your world-design paradigm, motivated players can find a way to alter the content.<p>So Bethesda does not actually have that power to shut off all mods.  They only have the power to shrink the brighter-hatted mod community.  And they shoot themselves in the foot by doing so.  They couldn&#x27;t sell their own downloadable content expansions as easily!<p>Never mind the &quot;bug fix&quot; and &quot;cutting room floor&quot; mods.  Arguably, these are things that Bethesda should have done themselves, prior to release.<p>I can think of no reasonable argument why Bethesda should get a cut of any mod.  It would be like the construction contractor that built the wall getting a cut if Banksy painted something on it.  Or maybe it&#x27;s more like the original artist of a thrift-shop painting getting a cut when someone paints dinosaurs into it and resells it for more money.  It makes no sense.<p>Copyright would only apply in that instance if someone made prints from the altered painting, but if you have to buy that existing copy of the original to get the additional dinosaur, there is no copyright violation, because there was no copy made.  The dinosaur may now be inseparably attached to the original, but the original was already paid for when it was altered.",1430321317

9458977,comment,9458259,9458259,0,0,QuantumRoar,,,"I&#x27;ve heard a few times that creating a decent desktop program with a GUI takes far more skill and experience. I can see why that is, since a fully fletched desktop program can be orders of magnitude more complex than most of the mobile and web apps.<p>I&#x27;d love to see more of the bleeding edge desktop software like the Adobe stuff, Blender, all the DAWs for Audio, etc. But it feels to me that not very many programmers have the skill to pull something like that off. Also, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of an incentive left to invest into such things.<p>I would very much want that the mind set changes a little bit. Great desktop software makes a profit from selling to customers who value quality and awesome features. I wonder why that is not enough incentive for ambitious programmers. I only ever hear about developers for mobile and web apps getting a lot of money for things I seriously don&#x27;t care about.<p>I have the feeling that we use desktop computers for the same things we used them ten years ago. I can&#x27;t even remember when I had the last &quot;I need that!&quot;-moment for desktop software. So why can&#x27;t we reinvent the desktop with software, like many try to reinvent what phones and web apps can be used for?<p>It&#x27;s like the desktop computer in this day and age is slowly reduced to a platform (OS) for a platform (browser) for web apps. That&#x27;s probably why many can get by with a tiny laptop or even a chromebook, which is probably the culmination of that thought.<p>However, I&#x27;ve not lost all hope. My bet is on virtual reality. If someone can build a really awesome VR application where everybody&#x27;s like &quot;I need that!!!&quot;, I can see how the desktop could return to its former glory, considering that a decent VR needs a ton of compute. But there&#x27;s still the problem that VR is hard, GPU programming is hard, 3D is hard, parallelization is hard and optimizing is hard.<p>So are there any pioneers left with an enormous amount of skill and time who would risk to start such a glorious and uncertain journey without some VC guy dropping a few million dollars on the table? Or are we all going to end up as web developers because that&#x27;s where the capital seems to be?",1430321309

(lspci in Linux userspace just walks the kernel-enumerated devices.)  In particular, BITS doesn&#x27;t have code to handle PCI-to-PCI bridges and enumerate the other side of them, or handle any quirks that crop up in real systems.<p>We have a very tiny Python pci module, which contains a brute-force bus-walk to find devices with a specific class; we&#x27;re using that to find PCI-attached USB host controllers so that we can force them to &quot;hand off&quot; to the OS, which then causes the BIOS to stop polling them, which often causes the BIOS to stop doing frequent SMIs.  (That allows us to tell if a BIOS&#x27;s out-of-spec use of long-running SMI handlers is caused by USB handling.)<p>Simple PCI enumeration, though, is effectively just &quot;walk every possible device, read the first four bytes of configuration space from function 0, if they&#x27;re not 0xffffffff then they&#x27;re vendor and product IDs, and then read the same from functions 1-7&quot;.",1430320906

GRUB2&#x27;s memory allocator then provides malloc, memalign, and free.  (It also has some special functions for things like allocating low memory, needed for some system operations such as the CPU setup mentioned below.)<p>In the BIOS version, GRUB2 is entered in 16-bit real mode, and it transitions to 32-bit protected mode; it then has its own memory map.  In the 32-bit and 64-bit EFI versions, the firmware transitions to 32-bit or 64-bit protected mode before calling GRUB2.  (In all cases, there&#x27;s no actual protection and the segment bases are all 0, though 64-bit mode does actually require a page table.)<p>However, GRUB2 normally only runs on the boot CPU (&quot;BSP&quot;, bootstrap processor).  We have to initialize the non-boot CPUs (&quot;APs&quot;, application processors) ourselves.  To do that, we allocate an aligned region of low memory, copy some bootstrap code and data into that memory, and send each processor an INIT (to reset them) and a startup inter-processor interrupt (SIPI) that forces them to jump to that address in low memory.  We then transition them from 16-bit real mode to either 32-bit or 64-bit protected mode ourselves.  (In the case of 64-bit protected mode, we set up paging by using the same page-table address that the firmware set up on the BSP, so that they all have the same memory map.)  With that done, the AP can then run C code.  Then we put the AP to sleep using mwait, waiting for work to do.  When we want them to do something, we hand them a function pointer and a pointer-sized parameter.",1430319880

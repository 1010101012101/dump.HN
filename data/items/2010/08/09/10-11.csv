This is the God Algorithm. And a different, much faster, algorithm that given a position finds a solution with 20 moves or less - lets call it a Mortal Algorithm. (It does not always give you the optimal solution, with the fewest moves, just one with 20 moves or less.) My understanding is that they have just run the Mortal Algorithm against every position to prove that it can solve every position in 20 moves or less. Their God Algorithm is much too slow to run against every position.<p>According to Wikipedia a God Algorithm only has to be 'practical', find the optimal solution to a position with a sensible amount of processing. So it can use search and back-tracking. We could term your algorithm that works without search and back-tracking as a God God Algorithm because it is an optimal sequence of processor moves that find the optimal sequence of cube moves. A God God Algorithm would be awesome, but a much more difficult thing to create. I imagine it would run orders of magnitude faster than their God Algorithm.<p>(PS. I don't think we can entirely rule out the possibility that the God God Algorithm might contain some small amount of search or back-tracking.)",1281351555

China, France, UK, Russia, and then next 10 biggest spending countries spend less than the US when they are all added together.<p>In addition the US imprisons more of its population than any other country in the world, including totalitarian police states, and a much greater proportion than any modern western nation.<p>In addition, the US spends a fortune on education and gets very poor outcomes.<p>In addition, the US spends far more per capita on health care than any other country in the world and has far worse outcomes than most countries, with infant mortality now falling behind many third world nations, and the interesting reality that the life expectancy of an indigenous Lakota indian man living in South Dakota receiving free unlimited federal health care is now 44 years.

There's a couple reasons behind my wariness:<p>1. It's currently only running on two linodes.<p>2. I wanted to ensure I had my MongoDB session handler working properly for scale out. If you notice any problems regarding sessions, please comment to let me know. I just enabled round-robin DNS and I had to fix a few hiccups along the way.<p>3. The number of API calls made to Twitter to generate a request is quite high, it's along the lines of ~105 requests if you have over 100 friends. Due to the sheer amount of data and handshakes being transferred, I was wary of both my bandwidth and the server load.<p>Oh well, here we go. It is quite likely you guys could get my servers to a crawl. If anybody is going to stress test my server, I would prefer if it's my fellow hackers to give appropriate feedback (and snarky comments) before I go entirely public with this thing.<p>I do plan on some form of integration with the new twitter recommendation API calls as well in the near future, but for now this is my completely custom version.<p>As a side note: I would appreciate it if you didn't tweet or blog about this as the site hasn't been stress tested and I'm just looking for some preliminary feedback.<p>I enjoy any and all comments and criticism.",1281348436

But to say that, simply because our bodies were not created with the preconceived notion of digesting them, we should not eat them, is silly.<p>I'm not saying we should eat them, but 'because we weren't designed to' is not a relevant point. We sure as heck weren't intended to eat potatoes or wheat either (rather impossible to eat without cooking, which hasn't been around forever), and they leave the diet a little deficient, yet the Irish sure did survive on them, and most of Europe built up on wheat. Would you condemn them as fools for eating something that wasn't tailor made for their stomachs? I applaud them for surviving and growing where food didn't previously exist.<p>French fries and soft drinks are terrible food, but the idea that there are some small collection of 'right foods' that we existed especially designed to eat is simply silly. The only time that sort of 'right food' idea is relevant, is with some animals that can only get a given nutrient one way, or animals that can only successfully hunt one type of prey.",1281348409

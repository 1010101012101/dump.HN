2249081,comment,2247842,2247842,0,0,ajays,,,"I attended a talk by an economist, and he gave the following explanation of how things worked. The assumption is: the value of a seat goes to 0 at the instant a plane takes off.<p>For a given number of seats available, you can plot a price (Y axis) -vs- time left (X axis) curve. This curve will gently slope down and hit 0 when t=0. Now you can plot a whole series of such curves, one for each N (where N = number of seats available). As N goes lower, the curves are higher.<p>If you're at a certain point in the curve for a particular N, if a seat gets sold, then you can jump up to the curve for N-1 . Obviously, the airlines' systems aren't fast enough to do this in realtime; so they do this adjustment in batches (every Monday and Wednesday?).<p>Anyways: this was what he claimed was going on. I'm not sure how correct the above is.",1298357903

That's what we've did once for a very similar service: Provide a server using the Internet Printing Protocol (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol</a>) that clients configure as remote printer (this works fine in Windows and Linux, we didn't test OS X at this time). The things that a user has printed are stored in an ""outbox"", where the user can just click on an item and specify where it should be sent. The advantage of this method is that you don't need the upload step and that you are able to support any application (without requiring users to convert the data to PDF first).",1298357891

And analysis of students who were admitted to such elite schools, but chose to matriculate elsewhere, shows that on the basis of income alone they had very similar success outcomes. Only for very-lower-income students was there a noticeable advantage to attending the elite school, where this metric is concerned.<p>Thus, the important factor is the ""type of student,"" not the ""type of school."" This is borne out in their conclusions as well:<p>""Consistent with the past literature, we find a positive and significant effect of the return to college selectivity during a student’s prime working years in regression models that do not adjust for unobserved student quality for cohorts that entered college in 1976 and 1989 using administrative earnings data from the SSA’s Detailed Earnings Records. Based on these same regression specifications, we also find that the return to selectivity increases over the course of a student’s career. However, after we adjust for unobserved student characteristics, the return to college selectivity falls dramatically. For the 1976 cohort, the return to school-SAT score for the full sample is always indistinguishable from zero when we control for the average SAT score of the colleges that students applied to in order to control for omitted student variables.""<p>Furthermore, I would importantly mention that while these studies are valuable, they do ignore significant changes in the nature of student bodies, labor markets, and educational institutions since the original cohorts are first observed; their findings can't fairly be 100% extrapolated onto current populations.<p>I could go more into the weeds here, but I think it is not ultimately necessary.

2249001,comment,2248890,2248890,0,0,arjunnarayan,,,"Slightly more technical detail from the paper: Essentially, the paper uses the instrumental variable[1] of ""which colleges did you apply to"" to create a rough metric of applicant-confidence/pedigree. They then find that this indicator better explains an earnings gap between college graduates than simply looking at which college you attended.<p>Namely, the simple fact that you thought you were good enough for MIT (even though you may have been rejected and went to a slightly worse school) is a larger predictor of future success than actually going to MIT.<p>Where this assumption doesn't hold is for minority students though. I won't get into that because its complicated and I'm not sure I fully understand the subtleties there. But focusing on the main point; I think the conclusion would resonate very well with the HN community: that simply applying to top tier schools boosts your expected income because it reflects something innate about you --- some kind of self-confidence that helps you throughout life.<p>This seems similar to a study[2], which I believe (I am going by memory here and this was a while ago) was discussed in Steven Levitt's Freakonomics[3], where the authors found that in places with really crummy schools; where sometimes there were lotteries to get into charter/magnet/better schools; that people who won the lottery didn't have better outcomes than people who lost the lottery. The theory was that the lottery outcome didn't matter so much as <i>entering</i> the lottery: because entering the lottery signified that the student had parents who cared enough about your education to enter you in the lottery... And in the long run this matters far more than going to a better school. All in all, a cool use of instrumental variables for the inner academic-economics nerd in me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13443"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13443</a><p>[3] Going off on a tangent here, Levitt really took the study of various previously unmeasurable phenomena via the use of instrumental variables to a new level. Some people argue as to the merits of this technique and whether it actually is very insightful. Critics deride it as statistical sophistry taken to the point of being almost useless in assigning causal inferences. I'm somewhat torn. I spent a while reading tonnes of instrumental variable studies, and while there are a significant set that are confusing and probably not very useful, it does seem on average a legitimate statistical technique, albeit with very subtle problems that need to be handled well. For more on this controversy, there is [4], [5], [6]. While this is a completely irrelevant tangent to the article, I thought it useful to see and think about a side of economics that is unrelated to the recent financial mess that macroeconomists are taking a lot of flack for.<p>[4] A hit piece on Levitt in the New Republic: <a href=""http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=b654079c-3fc5-4e6b-bb03-60ab5f5fd859"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=b654079c-3fc...</a><p>[5] Greg Mankiw's (Harvard Economist) take on it: <a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/is-steve-levitt-ruining-economics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/is-steve-levitt-ruini...</a><p>[6] Levitt's reply, including mention of Mankiw's analysis: <a href=""http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/am-i-ruining-economics-or-not/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/am-i-ruinin...</a>",1298355608

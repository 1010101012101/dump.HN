There are various reasons to dislike such a model, especially for an IDE, not the least of which is that the point of a well-designed IDE like LightTable is that it's easy to use and does not require a support contract. Being a support company creates the conflicting incentive that the software should not be too easy to use. Furthermore, support is not fun; you need to be a big company to earn a significant amount of money, because revenue is directly tied to man hours. Making new and exciting IDEs <i>is</i> fun, and revenue can be more directly tied to the value you produce, rather than the hours you put in.",1336866963

It's defined as the opposite of any of the qualities that we associate with the root ""human"".<p>They're normal people except that they can't be humane, they can't show any humanity, they completely lack compassion and normal human emotion. They don't share our motivations, their motives are alien and disruptive. They are ""other"". How do we diagnose them? Each of us decides what is morally repugnant to us, then when other people don't find it repugnant, we label it as sick and speculate whether it's genetically irredeemable. Did they have a mutation in their morality gene? Or are they just the descendants of Cain?<p>It's 100% culturally bound. Some people think that profit is morally repugnant - does that mean we live in a world of psychopaths? If they were the majority it would.<p>It's an ugly, dehumanizing term, and reveals a lot of psychology as a moral system rather than a scientific one - being its equivalent of evil. Labeling a 9-year old a psychopath is part of the same cultural process that causes children to be tortured and killed as witches in Nigeria.<p>btw: support <a href=""http://steppingstonesnigeria.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steppingstonesnigeria.org</a> :)<p>btw2: this doesn't mean I believe in Xenu.",1336866919

There was a genuine and severe hyperinflation crisis in the years after World War I, but the main economic reason for the Nazi ascendance to power in the early 1930s was actually a period of _deflation_ and mass unemployment. The Nazi rise to power coincided with an inflationary policy (Germany exited the gold standard in 1931), in part supported by the Nazis, that decreased unemployment and increased economic growth.<p>This is why its kind of funny when the current inflation aversion of German policymakers is attributed to a national trauma about hyperinflation. Its true that the hyperinflationary period 1919-1923 was deeply painful for Germans and you can understand that they dont want to repeat that, but surely the consequences of the deflationary period leading to the rise of National Socialism were worse.<p>(That doesnt mean that Keynes was wrong, but a story that sees hyperinflation leading to WWII is probably too simplistic. Its more like hyperinflation  gold standard  Great Depression  deflation  Nazis gain more seats  leave gold standard  Nazis gain absolute power.)<p>See <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/06/30/197736/austerity-going-global/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/06/30/197736/austerit...</a>",1336866340

The applet to inhibit screen sleeping went away. Without it, I often look up from working on a hard problem to discover that my screens have been blanked out.<p>2. Something GNOME-ish keeps grabbing my mouse, and won't let it go until I log in with SSH and start killall-ing anything with ""gnome"" in the process name. It happens once a day or so, I haven't been able to purposefully reproduce it, and it's <i>really</i> annoying.<p>3. The settings applet was neutered. It now looks like a cheap knockoff of MacOS's system settings, except somehow with even less functionality. It also seems like the GNOME developers simply forgot about it until about a month before the release, because many features that appear to be present are barely functional. For example, Appearance -> Theme only changes gtk3 themes, and most of the gtk2 themes don't have a gtk3 counterpart, so now about half of my apps don't look like the other half. Another example: the new settings applet stores network proxy settings somewhere weird now, so neither Firefox nor Chrome find my proxy settings any more.<p>4. About half of the GNOME configuration has moved to gconf to dconf, but there's no rhyme or reason as to which half. When I discovered the new settings applet, I tried to change stuff with gconf/dconf, except I have no idea how to figure out which applications use what settings storage backend.<p>5. A lot of applications don't have key bindings any more, or had them greatly reduced. GNOME 2 was pretty good about this, but many GNOME 3 applications are completely unusable without using the mouse.",1336864094

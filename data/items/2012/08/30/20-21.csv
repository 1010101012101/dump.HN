When I loaded it the only user who had a picture had a picture of Homer Simpson - not exactly a fashion icon.  Also, many of these users had zero clothes attached to them.<p>6 - Perhaps in the side bar you can tell me about how you figured out the fashion genome and that i'm only 5 clothes clicks away from having the perfect style for me figured out?  That would definitely intrigue me and make me want to register through face book and click on images.<p>Overall great work getting something live and out!",1346360306

If the numbers showed that self-driving cars were much less likely to cause an accident, it would be considerably cheaper for them (a much more dramatic version of how anti-lock brakes can make your liability coverage cheaper).<p>Comprehensive (mainly stuff that happens while you're not in the vehicle) would remain unchanged. But it's also the cheapest part.<p>Collision is what covers repairs to your own vehicle if you're at fault or if someone at fault isn't insured themselves (you can also skip the first part and just get uninsured motorist coverage). The uninsured at-fault driver case doesn't change until there are enough self-driving cars on the road that accidents as a whole go way down, but the first case (damage to your own vehicle that was your own fault) should be much less likely and thus cheaper to insure.",1346360287

From a very mixed set of experiences, Ive concocted a set of rules which make for happy space-sharing and almost no murder.<p>1. Bitching about your investors, investment deal or remote team-mate out loud will result in gossip, tweeting and you being labelled a moron. Correctly so.<p>2. Operators of shared working spaces should discriminate heavily against loud eaters. Ideally, everyone should be screened for excessive jaw noise.<p>3. Assume that your taste in music is shit and nobody wants to hear it.<p>4. To the person who has an audio plug-in which announces Youve got mail! each time you get an email, Im coming to murder you with a blunt axe. FOR EVERY MAIL.<p>5. If youre bringing in food, make sure it doesnt smell like a dead badger. I dont care how delicious it may be.<p>6.  Learn the not-very-difficult ability to speak on a conference call without yelling and I will be your friend for life.<p>7. Dont look at me as if Im invading your space when I cross the room. Its a shared office. Deal with it.<p>8. Taking meetings in a shared space is pretty much up there with Point 1. In addition, assume that Ill also be live-tweeting it.<p>9. If you make strange mouth noises, have weird breathing or any other bodily function which is somewhat disturbing, you should probably get a private office. Preferably in Mordor.<p>10.

For most, it was just things like working with other people on problem sets (which for some courses is considered cheating), not ""serious cheating"". But still, when ""cheating"" is this rampant, the university needs to reconsider its policy.<p>Personally, I liked a grad CS professor I had. On the first day, he spend 20 minutes talking about this. He very clearly defined what was and wasn't cheating, when we were and weren't able to collaborate, and the consequences (guaranteed F in the course, for even minor transgressions, and possible expulsion from the university). It was a very strict policy. He even told us that the answers for all of our labs and homeworks were available online if we looked, and even looking up the website was tantamount to cheating. If anything seemed like a grey area, we were required to get written permission from a TA or him to do. Draconian? Perhaps a bit.

Consuming one API is meat and potatoes to most of us; with decent documentation and the REST style largely being followed, API clients can be created rather quickly.<p>However, if I asked you to consume 1000 ""REST"" APIs, this becomes problematic. There is no agreement on representation, nor is there metadata available to infer commonalities.<p>So what have people done? They've tried to introduce solutions from other ""protocols"". As mentioned in the article, HAL attempts to introduce a predictable envelope around the data, using links and embedded resources to become so HATEOAS friendly.<p>However, there still are holes. How do I know what to do with links? The rel can tell you only so much - back to the documentation we go. How about we introduce a rel to a schema, like XSD, WADL or JSON Schema? Not many have done that and even fewer enjoy working with them.<p>How about knowing if I can PUT or POST to one of these links? Well the API could support OPTIONS request, but does this suit your data intensive mobile app consuming the API? Not too snappy. We could list them out individually in the representation (thereby replicating the HTTP design through representation) but now the size of the representation is growing dramatically just to support metadata that rarely changes.<p>OData, GData and even CMIS have all tried to take a stab at data communication protocols. Yes, they bring solutions to some of these issues at the cost of complexity and verbosity. Plus, they use use discovery endpoints. And they still tend to fall back on XML over JSON because of use of Atom etc. And now we are halfway back to SOAP.<p>How about the versioning issue? Should client be aware of representation structure changes and adapt accordingly? Well WRML (<a href=""http://www.wrml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wrml.org/</a>) tried to take that one on and all the best to you if you read that through once and understand it, never mind implementing the actual clients and servers.<p>As ori_b summarized ""REST isn't a protocol, it's a protocol pattern"". REST can't fit all scenarios. But I think what's becoming clear is that no-one has found anything better, just more specialized. So the days of auto-building clients to consume APIs is far away.<p>I guess we'll just have to embrace the chaos and keep building snowflakes.",1346357975

4456517,comment,4455983,4456273,1,0,lmkg,,,"Mix-ins are a style of object-oriented design, in the sense that inheritance, or composition, or generic functions are styles of object-oriented design. They all have the same purpose: logically related pieces of code are co-located and encapsulated, and independent pieces of behavior are decoupled. Ideally, the components of your system should have low interdependency, and be easy to combine.<p>The idea of Mix-ins is that an object may have several functional components, like say a printer, a logger, maybe some access controls for user privileges, in addition to the actual class bits. Under a mix-in system, you would write a printer mix-in, a logger mix-in, and an access-control mix-in, and then any of your classes can get that functionality just by including them. Adding this functionality is supposed to be literally as easy as adding a decorator in Python, but in order to do this, they usually need programmatic access to the guts of your class in order to insert themselves. That aspect, allowing mix-ins to make programmatic additions and modifications to a class, are what separates them from other styles of OOP like inheritance and composition (those other styles see this as breaking encapsulation, while mix-ins say the components are still functionally independent).<p>A traditional (inheritance-based) object system probably won't be able to write these services as independent components without meta-programming, and you usually see mix-in libraries written on top of meta-programming systems (a more limited form is also available via multiple-inheritance). They goal is that they provide one of the more common uses of meta-programming, but in a structured and standardized form, since raw meta-programming (and unrestricted multiple-inheritance) has a reputation for going bonkers pretty quickly. Adding it to a stricter language like C# requires extending the language with a tool, not just writing a library.",1346357703

Some media types support hyperlinks, like HTML, which describe how links should be included (anchors, forms and link elements).<p>For media types that don't support hyperlinks, such as images, video etc; you can use the HTTP header Link (<a href=""http://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader</a>).<p>Both these methods support the relationship attribute allowing you to specify the relationship between resources thus documenting the way clients should interact with such linked hypermedia (e.g. the HTML media type specifies that Link elements with the rel attribute should perform a HTTP GET request to the indicated resource).<p>In the example you gave, you could use a rel attribute like ""comment"" and link to the comments.

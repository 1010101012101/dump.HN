There are solutions to that too, but they aren&#x27;t great, take up space, are expensive, etc.<p>In a game where you are strapped into a seat, you don&#x27;t have that problem.  You remain seated in your chair at home and remain seated in game, so everything works great.  The Sixense Hydra controllers, or similar, could probably be great for manipulating switches and leavers in your cockpit.",1378756773

6355752,comment,6355549,6355658,6,0,jofer,,,"First off, 2011 was most definitely not &quot;pre-fracking&quot;. The majors moved into unconventionals in a big way starting around 2006-2007, and the independents were doing it well before that.<p>However, unconventional gas resources don&#x27;t particularly play into this calculation.  Gas (as in methane) is a completely different resource in this context.  The markets are different and the reserves are very different (there&#x27;s a lot more methane).  The &quot;peak oil&quot; debate focuses on liquid hydrocarbons.<p>There are several liquids-rich unconventional &quot;fracking&quot; plays (e.g. the Bakken in North Dakota), but they&#x27;re not particularly common. Oil shale is a much bigger player in terms of volume, but again, you&#x27;re looking at slow, expensive, environmentally costly production.<p>It&#x27;s certainly more of a long-term problem, but it is something to be worried about.  It&#x27;s hard to replace liquid fossil fuels in terms of energy-density per unit volume.  It&#x27;s a problem that we as a society need to be working a _lot_ more on.",1378756720

In fact, intents are how an app launches a new screen when you press a button etc - by sending an intent to the system telling it to launch a new activity.<p>Some of the UX around intents isn&#x27;t great, but the core concept and implementation is very clever and doesn&#x27;t get the attention and respect it deserves.

I&#x27;m claiming that saccharine niceness goes WITH vicious back-stabbing.  Because people who are vicious back-stabbers are going to be inclined to overcompensate with niceness.<p>>I find that someone who doesn&#x27;t work well with emotions is typically bad at reasoning too, because the arguments they make end up expressing their feelings in obtuse ways.<p>I find the opposite.  In science, in order to assess your evidence, you often have adopt a somewhat dispassionate stance, and make judgements unclouded by emotion.  An inability to process emotion, then, can be a tactical advantage, because it doesn&#x27;t incur the overhead of compartmentalization (which taxes my brain).  And to go to the extreme, I have had had more than one friend who were extremely impaired in their ability to process human emotions (I think the in thing is to label this &#x27;asperger&#x27;s&#x27;) who were extremely good at reasoning, as evidenced by the fact that they were brilliant mathematicians, and I don&#x27;t mean number crunchers - full on propositional logic and proof-crafters.",1378756584

But nothing new under the sun: Don Knuth worked together with Hermann Zapf (e.g. on the design/development of AMS Euler). Before that legendary collaboration, Knuth worked alone on his Computer Modern Family  which is, by all means, a feat of clever programming in ways designers never could think/dream of (parameterized design variables, etc.). But Knuth eventually realised he needed the help of a vetted calligrapher and type designer like Zapf to get the best out of his software  and improve on it (Knuths account on the collaboration is a great read). A lot can be said (and has been said) on design principles, objective geometry vs optical subjectivism, quantifiability, measurability and programmability in and of type design. Adrian Frutiger probably goes farthest in this theoretical thinking.<p>Anyhow: I fully support hackers who engage in typography and type design. I fancied both the designer/developer of Hermit, as the HN community in general might be interested to hear the opinion of the type design pros. Theyve had their dedicated forum since 2000.

I think that whatever is unconscious (read: lost, forgotten, dissociated, unfelt, or unthought) ends up getting expressed anyway, in yourself or in your relationships.  Seeing this expression clearly in the world requires working with your emotions.  If you cannot do that, then it&#x27;s very difficult for any of your strongly held &quot;rational&quot; views to change, because doing so would require dealing with some pretty heavy emotions.<p>The upshot is that it gets really tiresome to argue in situations where you&#x27;ve realized this is what&#x27;s happening.  In my experience, most of the time that you see hardcore polarization on an issue, where all appeals to reason seem to fall on deaf ears, it&#x27;s actually due to some kind of emotional blockage like this.

When you initiate any action that would use an intent in Android, you get that selection popup window that let&#x27;s you choose any app that can handle that intent. So I think there is already app discovery? Unless you mean something like Play Store integration into Android itself, in which you can view applications on Google Play that can handle that intent. That is pretty interesting and should be do-able even without Google&#x27;s intervention with just a database of Google Play apps... I looked around but didn&#x27;t find anything. Might be a cool project to try.<p>2. Each app defines what intents it can handle, so I don&#x27;t think curation is necessary. The app select popup window is already curating that for you?<p>3. This context knowledge is provided inside every intent. Not all apps choose to use it, though. In some cases I&#x27;d guess the sandbox would get in the way as well. I&#x27;m not sure how much practical value this would have anyway? Can you explain it a bit more?<p>4. There is nothing stopping Apple from adopting Android intents, but obviously they won&#x27;t. This is a &#x27;pie in the sky&#x27; suggestion that won&#x27;t happen for the same reason there is more than one flavour of Linux. It&#x27;s like asking why you can&#x27;t pipe results from your unix system to a Windows system - it just won&#x27;t happen for political reasons.",1378755340

At best, I think that the WoT <i>documents trust relationships</i> between entities with keypairs.<p>I actually really like this feature of the WoT, because I think it does a good job of simulating the actual trust relationships between people in real life. In a private conversation, I might imagine a friend vouching for someone another person as trustworthy; a key signature from my friend does something similar, in a secure fashion. This is good because I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> my web of trust or social network to be able to say &quot;this key is certain to be trustworthy&quot;: after all, it can&#x27;t actually guarantee that. But I don&#x27;t mind seeing trust opinions from my friends, and their friends&#x27; friends.<p>If anything, I think the trust relationships in GPG (&quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;marginal&quot;, &quot;full&quot;) are too unclear, and I know that these numbers mean different things to different people. I&#x27;d prefer the ability to add a short note to the signature so I could say something like,<p>&quot;I know this person well and you can be confident that this key is theirs, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re careful enough to trust their signatures.&quot;",1378755246

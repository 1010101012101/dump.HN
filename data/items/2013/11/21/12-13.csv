But if thousands of people are hiding from govt routinely, it&#x27;s much more expensive for govt to go after all of them at once. See what happens with Bittorrent. Some people get caught or threatened, while thousands of others enjoy cheap movies.<p>Regarding last example: you underestimate the power of good mixing. You can swap coins anonymously so that all the &quot;tainted&quot; coins get distributed to thousands of different hands and never go back to you anymore, while you receive thousands of little coins back, from various sources, not tainted by whatever business you was doing before.",1385038090

For the vast majority that freedom would make no difference. They don&#x27;t know how to change things anyway. I remember a few months back on here when we were going &#x27;Why don&#x27;t people use PGP more? Oh yeah, the interface sucks.&#x27; And did anyone change the interface? Nope, not to my knowledge at least.<p>Did any of us make better encryption tools, despite there being available encryption libraries? Not to my knowledge.<p>That sort of freedom is tied to your capabilities as much as it is your tools. If your understanding of a computer goes something along the line of &#x27;that magical glowing box under the desk.&#x27; it makes no difference either way.<p>To get to real freedom, in the sense that Stallman seems to mean, requires more than a change to open source software, it requires a system be built from the ground up to not just enable but also encourage co-evolutionary mastery. And it&#x27;s not clear how that would work. Having the source code of the system available is probably a part of it, but you also need people to be able to start off with simple changes using the same language that the system is described in - preferably they&#x27;d use that language at least to some degree to instruct the system to do basic operations.<p>A lot of that probably has to do with how modular you can make a program - when you make changes how much of the program do you have to hold in your head to understand their effects? And I think that&#x27;s probably, ultimately, a processor architecture level decision if you want it to be how most things on the system work.<p>Looking at it from the software side: at the moment, even with open source software, sure you can theoretically go in and learn about the program and make alterations and ... but that is not a trivial thing to do. Even for people with deep knowledge of computing it&#x27;s not a trivial thing to go and learn about how the program works, and if they don&#x27;t already know the language it&#x27;s even worse. There are loads of open source projects out there at the moment where what needs to be done is essentially obvious but there&#x27;s such a lack of people with the abilities and interest to do it.",1385036562

I implemented Hashcash a couple years ago into my email wrapper and the algorithm is (in it&#x27;s essence) suprisingly similar to Bitcoin: given this data, find a hash that has a consecutive number of x zeros in it.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the 1/20th of a second though. Back in the day, the <i>slowest</i> Hashcash stamp with 5 ending zeros I could produce (with optimized code of course) was marginally above 1 second. But the good thing about Hashcash is that, much like Bitcoin - the difficulty scales. Just ask for more zeroes and it&#x27;ll take longer. Email clients could also use the number of zeroes to help email classification: 0 zeros = SPAM, 5-8 zeroes = HAM.",1385035811

People with free will exchanging money for sex is fine.  And having legal prostitution should allow better regulation - children and trafficked workers get better protection; legal sex workers get better health care.<p>But those things that make legal prostitution more acceptable make it more expensive, which is the gap filled by criminal gangs exploiting trafficked workers.<p>> Anecdotally I do get the feeling that prostitutes as a profession are mainly serving an older generation though, so I&#x27;m not sure if they remain economically viable anyway.<p>Everybody gets old.  Online dating shows there are many lonely people.<p>I&#x27;m gently surprised there&#x27;s nothing exploiting the gap between &quot;rent a friend&quot; and &quot;sex work&quot; for &quot;rent someone to give you fully clothed, non-sexual, hugging and conversation&quot;.",1385035789
6774235,comment,6771640,6771640,5,0,DharmaPolice,,,"As someone who regularly has to write SQL in 7 different dialects I much prefer VARCHAR to TEXT as the former is handled much more consistently across platforms. A TEXT column in MS SQL Server is an entirely different proposition to a VARCHAR column. VARCHAR on the other hand is treated with relative similarity between most of the systems I regularly use.<p>Additionally, one of the key benefits of more explicit datatypes is documentation. Knowing that a column is 30 characters wide is useful information to have at hand (without having to check check constraints) and often reflects a business rule. Where joins have to be performed on character columns it also helps to know if both sides of the join are both (say) CHAR(8). If every text column is TEXT then that&#x27;s much less clear. Check constraints help but you don&#x27;t always know if they&#x27;ve been applied to all current data (some platforms allow for constraints to ignore current data). If I know a column is VARCHAR(50) then I am 100% certain that there will be no value longer than 50 in it.",1385035757

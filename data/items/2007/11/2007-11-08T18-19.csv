77575,comment,77445,77545,0,0,Tichy,,,"Ok, if Facebook would pull the app,  I could add Facebook to my anti-lobby list ;-) The point is not being on Facebook especially, it is putting a number to the bad publicity. Pissing one customer off is one thing, pissing off one hundred another. It could actually be a valuable service for the targeted companies. They already have ""retention scores"" for single customers, maybe they would be happy to be able to compute retention scores for groups. <p>I don't care so much for random complaints voiced on the internet, because they are not by my friends whom I trust. <p>I am actually a bit concerned about painting too bleak a picture about some companies. For example, if a company shifts a huge number of products, there are bound to be some random problems. That way it might appear as if company X has much worse customer service than company Y, even though company X has ten times better customer service than company Y (ie if X sells 100 times more products than Y). <p>And sometimes it is really the customer who is being obnoxious. Hopefully in that case the customer's friends would tell him to let go, or at least not support the case.",1194548031

Any further breaches won't even be newsworthy, and the feds know they will role over... so any time a hushmail.com adddress comes up in an investigation, they'll just demand the info.

77556,comment,77345,77430,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Wait... which app is that income for? SocialMedia or Appsaholic or something else entirely? And they have no large infrastructure behind the scenes?<p>Going back to amichail's original comment, the implication was that making Facebook apps is really easy, and therefore a cofounder might be less necessary. The only point I was trying to make was that any Facebook app that is going to be really easy to make is unlikely to be a big revenue generator. My assumption was that any app that was going to be big enough and useful enough to generate good revenue was going to require a significant backend external website to crunch numbers and store relevant info.<p>So what's the point of what I'm saying? I was trying to counter the idea that building a revenue-generating Facebook app would be any easier than building an independent site. In both cases, you have to build the backend, anyways. So then we're merely talking about the difficulties of building the interface, and I was saying that it's not that hard to do with Apache and a script in just about any language: just print what you want the browser to see to standard output. Even if building a Facebook interface is easier, that is fraught with other complications (such as worrying about Facebook itself doing its own, official version of your app).<p>So in the end, I'm saying that building a successful Facebook app is not much different from building a successful website, so if you need a cofounder for a website, then you also need one for the app.",1194546558

They're adding a $19/server flatfee, and then increasing the hourly cost by 10c - 16c/hr..<p>Granted, they're bringing their name and reputation to the party, and you can use official RHEL packages, rather than CentOS, but it doesn't seem worth it for almost any startups.<p>From:   <a href=""http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/faq/</a><p>`
For Technical questions: Red Hat provides support for end-customer questions about the services. Technical issues be addressed by Red Hat associates working in concert with Amazon support and engineering in the event of issues with the EC2 infrastructure.<p>For Customer Service issues: All customer service issues (Billing, EC2 Account Activation, etc.) should be forwarded directly to Amazon via application-payments@amazon.com.

Minimizing time-to-market, that works probably in favor of no matter how many are the founders. <p>Thus, as the number/quality of founders decreases so the earlier your implementation should get or be feasible to get to the market.

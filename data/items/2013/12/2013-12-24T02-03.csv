Our economic system is deeply dependent on the assumption of at least stable if not growing population. Companies benefit from people who perform that basic function, and therefore it isn&#x27;t wrong to force them to pay for benefits like parental leave.

I worked in both &quot;core dev&quot; and professional services development, and have seen what comes from well-architected software design, the sort of architecture that only experienced top-line CS graduates (or several-decades-worth-of-experience autodidacts or engineers) seem capable of producing (IMHO, YMWV)...<p>...and have seen many, many 1.0&#x27;s, shelfware, etc.<p>A CS grad from a top-flight school with excellent experience is worth their weight in gold, at least on teams of multiple people developing big systems - you want at least one, they will take care of data design, software architecture, etc., and likely cause your code to be more robust, more maintainable, etc.<p>But motivated college grads (I&#x27;m Canadian, not sure what the US term would be), talented engineers, and autodidacts can crank out code like nobody&#x27;s business. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d want to built a multi-year &quot;core services&quot; library out of it, but PoCs, MVPs, 1.0&#x27;s, and demoware? Why not? And the top-flight CS grad might be wasted there.<p>I&#x27;m torn because I care about quality, but really high quality only matters for the really long-lived system, the health-and-safety-critical system, and the system that must survive on its own with minimal human intervention and maintenance.<p>Were I building a radiation control for healthcare, I would want electrical engineers and CS grads from top-flight systems. Ditto military avionics.<p>If I was building apps, apps, apps, servers built atop well-architected OSS libraries, etc., I&#x27;d want code, fast, and I&#x27;d balance quality Vs lifetime to maximize profit, and probably hire less experienced, less well trained devs who &quot;give good face&quot;, understand requirements, and code fast.<p>The libraries themselves?

Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d expand it if I had 100 hours to kill:<p>- Rename the repo to be shared and add yourself as a contributor, instead of branding it as yourself.<p>- Organize the files by src/ALGO/LANG/author-name.EXT. That way the emphasis is on the algorithm, then the language. I don&#x27;t care much about who implemented it, other than to differentiate it from others&#x27; implementations for quality, etc.<p>- Provide a common-ish API. You don&#x27;t want to stick your entire algorithm into main(), that&#x27;s not useful. You want a nice clean interface, so that the consumers of this repo can copy-paste these clean implementations into their own code. Maybe remove main() entirely, and stick it into src/ALGO/LANG/main.EXT. That way I can consume an entire file from your repo without modifying it.<p>- Provide unit tests. If you separate out main(), you could do stick all the tests into src/ALGO/LANG/tests.EXT. The value of this type of repo would be that I can grab a clean, well tested copy of <i></i><i></i><i></i>-sort and use it directly.<p>- Edit: Change from underscores to dashes in filenames. Underscores are for losers :). Use dashes whenever you can.<p>- Add lots more algorithms, not just basic ones.<p>- Get a few friends to add some algorithms, then thoroughly review them in comments on GitHub.<p>- Provide speed test comparisons of each implementation, stick them in src/ALGO/LANG/speed-tests.EXT<p>- Now that we are getting fancy with the testing, etc., provide a Makefile or some such for building the various test programs and running unit and speed tests on them.<p>- Edit: Stub out lots of potential algorithms. Even if you don&#x27;t know how to implement them, create the directory and main.EXT for them, then open a ticket so that others can implement them. Give everyone that submits a pull request committer access, so they might work directly on this repo and not deal with any friction by having to wait for you.<p>There is probably more, but the above would eat nicely into that first 100 hours. I have no idea what you&#x27;d personally get out of this on the other end. Probably nothing. On the other hand, this could become <i>the</i> repository to check for a weird &quot;2x faster with smaller memory usage&quot; implementation of a red-black tree, or a clever general number sieve, etc.",1387852552

For an indie band on a small label, record sales are all that matter if they hope to not get dropped.<p>A band like Iron Maiden has the luxury of not caring as much about recording because they have visibility, they have leverage, they have an existing market, and they already profited directly from &quot;music as a product.&quot; Smaller bands, however, only matter when they are doing new things -- releasing albums, specifically -- and the budget for that is the direct result of sales if it is coming from a label.

Adequacy and personal development mean nothing to them so long as they remain gainfully employed. These men and women also tend to be the most boring people to converse with, not because they lack passion for programming, but because they have no apparent passions at all.

That's a striking result, because ""digit span"" used to be regarded as a reliable proxy for IQ. (There are still IQ tests that have a digit span item as part of the item content.)

Josh Groban and Mozart are based on some level of ""skill"" where Strongest Man and Tour de france have a physiological or genetic component.  That may or may not be present within singing.  As mentioned in my other response, deliberate practice and coaching are what seem to determine skill level.  Also discussed in talent is overrated is the notion that deliberate practice seems to have a lifetime cumulative effect.  So you probably can't catch up with a Groban or Tiger Woods simply because they have such a large cumulative head start in their fields.<p>Genetic potential is something else entirely.  It's hard to say how much of being a strong man or winning the tour de france is genetic, but likely the effect of genetics is less than we typically think.  As an example in the book mentioned, they discuss the change in mile times since the four minute barrier was broken.  The amount of people who can run a four minute mile now cannot be due to evolutionary changes in that brief period but is much more likely to be caused by improvements in teaching and training methods.<p>Anyway again, I highly recommend ""Talent is Overrated"" by Geoff Colvin.

</code></pre>
You're actually just wrong here; liberalism is inherently an ally with the poor; and you will find more liberals in the middle class than any other alignment.<p>Beyond that, the reason I am optimistic is because I perceive a clear trend between sharing of information and 'fairness'.  In virtually all cases of inequality, a small percentage of people control, have power over, or exploit a majority of people.  The only reason they are able to maintain their regime is that when isolated instances of rebellion start to quell, they are quickly extinguished through force or other manipulation.<p>Historically, it's organization of these exploited-majorities, including efficient means of internal communication which has led to successful revolutions; and without the internal communication they are bound to remain fragmented, and thus easily extinguished.<p>The internet has completely changed the game in that regard; the total ramifications have not been seen yet; as the first people to mass adopt the internet were middle class and upwards and used it for what those people do with all their lives, entertainment and work.<p>However, that's not what poor people do.  Not having ever been poorer than an avg broke 20-something; I can't speak directly; but at least in South America I know there is intense power struggles happening between the rich and the poor.<p>The rich can 'stay on top' the poor due to their power-advantage.  They have control of the social structure, and beyond that just generally have capital, more freedom and ability to move and communicate, etc.<p>However, as the information age progresses, more and more things that used to require capital, or large amounts capital can now be infinitely distributed for free (or nearly free) as software; thus raising the power of the poor.<p>As the power of the poor, or the lowest classes of society raises, they will be more and more successful.<p>Beyond that, having an attitude of brotherly love and compassion for all humans is the best 'meta-game' strategy.  That is, if life is a game and being altruistic or selfish is a strategy, altruism is going to win in the long run.  Players tend to trend toward successful strategies as a game gets played more and more (and results of others success get more and more eyeballs), and thus I have to assume that overtime altruism will become more and more common as a life-strat.",1291567057

It is often a waste of time to slog at something you are naturally geared for when the alternate is to work on something you are better suited for.<p>Passion, drive, curiosity, ambition and mental fortitude also highly variable among people. The ""you could do it if you only made an effort""-sentiments really irritate me, even though they usually spring from the inability to understand different minds rather than any malice or sense of superiority.<p>Virtually everyone has a few talents, and the question is mostly of opportunity to discover them (which does not exist for everyone, even in wealthy societies), ""passion"" for it - which could less romantically simply be described as the perseverance to work at it through the highs and lows.<p>In other words, humbug.",1291567008

This shouldn't result in leakage to other customers although it is up to the vendor to make sure this doesn't happen.<p>Depending on the implementation, vendor-supplied encryption may or may not mitigate this risk, but customer-supplied encryption always will because the customer knows where the dividing line stands.",1291566445

He breaks it down into time spent working on the fundamentals in a specific way - called deliberate practice and coaching.  So the sheer amount of time isn't the fundamental issue, it's the amount of time spent practicing in a specific way and how good the quality of instruction you have access to.  It's a fantastic read, but it will deeply challenge many assumptions that are culturally embedded in the U.S.  It's amazing how addicted to the notion of talent people are.  It helps people make sense of the world, it gives them excuses for not being world class.

In fact, both are pieces of the same puzzle. As mechanical_fish pointed out, passionate but untalented people exist. And guess what? Talented but dispassionate people exist as well.<p>There was an article here on HN recently, discussing common creativity blocks. The article mentioned a certain study which found that, once a certain IQ threshold was reached, creativity <i>no longer</i> scaled with IQ. They became independent of one another. The same is likely true for passion and talent, with the ultimate effect being on ability. Once you reach a certain threshold for both, an increase in one will increase your ability to ultimately perform a task. This accounts for situations like those of the author, where a low perceived talent had little effect on his ability, as his passion was so great. It also accounts for situations like those described by mechanical_fish, where a person has not reached a certain natural talent threshold, and can therefore not increase his ability substantially through passion alone.<p>Most people have one in spades, and enough of the other.

And if you build more manufacturing plants here like Foxconn--which build Apple's iPhone in China--Americans wouldn't want to do those jobs. It's mindless, grunt work,"" he said."" (Vivek Wadhwa being quoted)<p>So about the comment on destructive manufacturing, I would refer to the Subaru Zero Landfill manufacturing plants - see <a href=""<a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/124147/article.html>Edmunds</a&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/124147/article...</a>; and to the comment about mindless grunt work I offer a personal anecdote.<p>I had a company of 20 employees, and we did manufacturing here in Tucson. One day I was expressing gratitude to the office assistant about her consistently excellent work in keeping the mundane office chores under control (filing, mailers, etc) and she replied ""thanks, I am an office robot - it is what I love to do"". I was flabbergasted - she loved the work! Personally I hate filing, mailers or any of the mundane things and I view it as torture, but she loved it. So I did a little survey at the next company meeting and found out that half the employees like closed ended work like filing or packing inventory and half the company liked open ended work like sales or figuring out how to make something. The closed ended group would finish their jobs on Friday afternoon and not think a single thing about work until Monday morning. The open ended crowd would send emails at odd times of the night and weekends, obviously thinking about work all the time.<p>So my experience is that people like Kat (my office robot) love the closed ended work because they know where the beginning, middle and end of the job are and if they have done a good job or not. The people who like open ended jobs like them because they are not the same every time - and I note that Wadhwa (and programmers, salespeople and writers etc) have open ended jobs. It should be hardly surprising that they don't understand the other point of view. I think there are a lot of people that would like 'mindless' manufacturing work, if they were given the opportunity.<p>PS. If anyone needs a great office person, Kat is now living in Portland OR.

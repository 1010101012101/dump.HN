Because they have so much of the advertising market, every minute you spend on the web is essentially more revenue for them, and the more pages you view in that minute the more revenue for them.  Thus they are happy if you spend more time online.<p>If that means making a better browser so people will be more comfortable on the web and spend less time loading pages, Google gets more revenue.<p>If it means making a good mobile OS so people spend time on the web from their phones, Google gets more revenue.<p>If it means their competitors improve their products to make people happy to spend more time on the web, Google gets more revenue.<p>Improvements to IE is more ad impressions/clicks for Google as people will be inclined to spend more time and visit more sites online.

850886,comment,850485,850485,0,0,bbg,,,"btilly clearly expressed a fine method for effective teaching.  I was impressed when I read the HN post a while back, and I'm even more impressed with the blog post.  I am incorporating the idea about homework divided into thirds into my own teaching.  Many of his other ideas are already there, if in slightly different form.<p>However, I will gripe about his messianic tone.  As far as I can tell from his blog post, he's taught only one class!  Even if he taught a few others as a grad student, my point holds.<p>When I first started teaching nine years ago, as a grad student, I had miraculous success with my classes.  I didn't have any grand scheme like btilly did; all I had were some commonsense observations from my father, a lifelong teacher.<p>But as a new teacher, I was really learning the material for the first time (that's the case with virtually all new teachers -- it has to do with the process of teaching), and so I could carefully observe the students' progress at every step.  If they stepped into a pothole, I stepped into it with them: I felt that I had failed to explain something clearly if the students didn't get it.  (btilly says the same.)  The students loved the class, they became very competent, and their enthusiasm for the subject attracted attention.  I was a star teacher.<p>However, as the years have ground on, I have taught the same subjects over and over again.  I'm no longer on a journey of discovery along with the students.  Instead, I know where every curve and pitfall lies.  I can see a pothole a mile before we get there.  You might think that this makes me a more effective teacher, because I can make the journey a smooth arc from beginning to end.  But it doesn't: intellectual discovery is about stepping into potholes, not sailing by on a cruise ship.<p>I'm still sort of a star teacher (evals are <i>very</i> high, and my classes are always full, in part because word gets around), but I've never had a class with the same enthusiasm and brilliance as that first one.<p>(I'm an adjunct professor, so I get paid shit wages, and I have no incentive to do a good job, but that's a different story.)<p>So I gripe about the messianic tone in btilly's post because it sounds like precisely the sort of thing a successful new teacher would say.  (BTW, not all new teachers are successful.)  I wonder if with a decade of teaching experience he would see his miraculous method as the distinguishing factor in his early success.  In fact, his early success may have been due primarily to the advantages of a neophyte, which are hard to sustain.",1254246183

He would put up a question on a projection screen in front of the class, and everyone would tap out an answer on a Wi-Fi enabled Treo PDA, which would send the students' answers to a server. Then the right answer would show up on the projection screen, so students get immediate feedback.<p>Maybe this shows that active involvement is essential, and it does not matter if students ask or answer questions.

And gifted learners most definitely need educational provisions different from typical school programs. High-IQ adults may or may not feel they have a supportive social circle, depending crucially on their paths to higher education and the careers they pursue. Gifted people in general have special needs, and depressed people in general have special needs, and there may be a special intersection of needs in gifted people who are depressed, but it is not clear yet what role, if any, giftedness has in mood disorders.",1254244082

I'm making a claim about general mac users.<p>I don't know a single person (even amongst the techies) who has uninstalled iTunes from their mac. I know few people who don't use it every single day. If you use an iPhone, or an iPod, you use iTunes. There is no supported alternative. There isn't even a widely used alternative for just playing music on the mac.<p>On another level, Snow Leopard, the operating system Apple is shipping, is not just about Mac OS X proper. iTunes ships with Snow Leopard, along with probably a hundred other applications. They come installed. They are part of the product. And to the vast majority of the computer using population, there is no distinction between those two things.",1254243978

We're a startup that just went into private beta. Until now, we've been manually approving new users and want to switch to a more automated process. We want to make sure that the people approved for our free product are qualified leads for the paid version which is coming soon. Since we spend so much time and energy getting folks to the website, I want to make sure we're doing the best we can to get them to actually sign up and use the product, but like I said, we want them to be qualified.<p>So, right now we have a 2-step registration process. You just fill in your name and email, then click submit. You're then redirected to a second form asking for more information. The more they fill in, the better we can qualify them. The problem: people don't fill it out.<p>The second approach would be to ask everything up front. I'm just afraid this will make even more people go away without even filling in anything.<p>So, what do you think? Make them fill out everything up front, or do a small ask then an additional one?<p>Thanks!",1254243924

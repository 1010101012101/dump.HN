One law for example is that each lodging facility should keep its toilets open for public. Which basically means all the 5 star hotels need to keep their toilets open for public use.<p>India might have archaic and North Korea like laws but it also has a non-functional government and police force which is mostly busy with other trivialities so even though article 377 exists, I am not aware of any people being harassed for being gay by government or authorities. Gay parties are common and have known several gay couples who have lived safely together.<p>Even though 200 people are prosecuted under this it is less because for they being gay and more because of other reasons. For example it is very common of Indian politicians to put you in jail for any random reason. In most cases, 377 is applied along with rape, domestic violence or divorce cases as the opponent seem fit.<p>Of course, India is not SF either. I think Indian liberal in their zeal to simply prove themselves &quot;liberal&quot; they are beating up the homosexuality drum needlessly in India. I think this is going to be counter productive and various political factions especially the Islam leaning parties might see an advantage in making life of Gays a bit more difficult.",1414748621

They will just hold them more quietly.<p>Finally - Eich being drilled out of the CEO position is not directly a suppression of his free speech or whatever; he is not being sent to jail for his views. The board of a company has the right to ditch a CEO for being &#x27;embarrassing&#x27;. The trouble is that this is not somehow a radical blow for gay rights: indeed, closeted gay people not too long ago would find their positions untenable for exactly the same reason if their sexuality was discovered (it was embarrassing, etc).<p>In order to get to a situation where they could go about their business <i>relatively</i> unmolested, gay people had to fight against, among other things, <i>exactly</i> this sort of kneejerk corporate small-c conservatism. The progress we&#x27;ve made on this issue was not made one non-profit CEO at a time; nor was it through individual gays having great individual &#x27;role models&#x27; (sorry Tim), but through prolonged <i>political</i> fights. I have little sympathy for Eich in this matter, but the idea that his being Mozilla CEO was a serious obstacle to gay rights was risible, and remains so.",1414747366

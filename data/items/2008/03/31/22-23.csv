It was just an explanation of what set me thinking about\nthe problem.  It's not a pillar holding up anything, so attacking it\nproves nothing.<p>(Incidentally, a moment's thought would have made it clear that I\nhave in fact ""put some time and thought into it.""  I've spent 24 years as a\nprofessional programmer, during which I've observed thousands of\nprogrammers working for all sizes of companies.  Plus I've seen\nfirst hand the transformation undergone by roughly 200 YC-funded\nfounders so far.)<p>The second half is fallacy:<p><i>But rather than pointing out fallacies, a better way to refute\nGraham's evolutionary argument is by reductio ad absurdum. ...  Our\nancestors lived in a world that was shrouded in darkness half the\nday, therefore we would be happier without electric lights.</i><p>This supposed refutation can itself be disproven by reductio ad\nabsurdum, because it could be applied to <i>any</i> explanation of our\ninclinations based on how we evolved.<p>(Bad example, incidentally. There do seem to be conflicts between\nelectric lights and human biology:\n<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/19/AR2008021902398.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02...</a>)<p>Neither of these arguments even attempts to refute the central point\nof the essay.  In case anyone wants to try it, the central point\nis that in an organization organized as a tree structure, structural\nforces tend to give each person freedom in inverse proportion to\nthe size of the whole tree.  That we work better in groups of 10\nthan 100 I feel is obvious enough not to need justification.  The\nargument from evolution is just an attempt to explain why groups\nthat size work.<p>Though on the whole my reaction is ""I want my 20 minutes back,""\nthere was one encouraging thing about this experience.  Even these\ndishonest DH5s are more civil than Atwood DH2ing\nabout my choice of metaphors.",1207004251

151455,comment,151427,151427,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that this is not the kind of thing you learn by reading a book - or sitting in front of a computer. It's a people thing. People have a knack for seeing through other people, whether they believe what they are presenting, like what they do etc.<p>These are the things I would recommend if you want to do a great demonstration:<p>- Love your product - nothing shines through like enthusiasm. Don't be afraid to show it either.<p>- Talk to people, study their reactions, smile to the waitresses, hook up with girls (or guys if that's your preference), start conversations with strangers on the bus. Like in all other walks of life if you practice interacting with people you will become good at it.<p>- Study great speakers when they do their thing - Start by looking at some of Steve Jobs keynotes. The guy is amazing. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are great at it too.<p>- Be prepared - Do your presentation until your girlfriend starts complaining that you talk in your sleep and she has heard more about you product while you sleep than she has heard about her other girlfriends sexlife. And that's a lot... Steve Jobs recites until everything is absolutely pixel perfect, and every eventuality is covered - and it shows. On their keynotes I heard that they have three independent AV systems. Just in case two of them break down.<p>- Read Dale carnegies ""how to win friends and influence people - it's much better than all the modern crap. It's from the 1930's if my memory serves me correctly.<p>Good luck :-)",1207004044

The problem with pointers in C is that the [star][varname] syntax means two different things, and they are actually contradictory from a certain perspective. In one context it means ""declare a variable that is a pointer"" and in the other it means ""deference"". Whenever my languages-brain bit looked at this it couldn't deal with it, recognised it as a contradictory positions and basically shut me down, but not in a way that let me work out what was going on. Have a look at it yourself from that perspective - hopefully you'll see what I always did. Now whenever I look at C code I instead just think ""everything is an int and pointers are all about casting ints, and a star when you declare something is your way of telling the compiler that the type of this thing is int-pointer instead of just int"". Thus I now have no difficulties at all.""",1207003749

I think even though its early the increase of signups is likely to be greater than the loss of users through confusion. Especially if implemented well using Clickpass ;-)<p>Also another answer is that it is currently not completely trivial to implement, so if you don't think the benefit outweigh the time to implement than you wouldn't.

There are a few Web sites that allow you to login to using your Facebook cridentials, and by doing so they can email you without knowing your email address.

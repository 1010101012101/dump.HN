Imagine trying to read backscroll of a chat conversation and then trying to &quot;redo&quot; this in chat vs the same in email. The chances (not saying it doesn&#x27;t happen, but the likelihood) is higher that you can have an effective email exchange. If you aren&#x27;t right there for the chat, it&#x27;s over. Some people love this, some people hate it. It&#x27;s certainly not efficient for group settings. And dear god, please don&#x27;t make and announce decisions this way.<p>It&#x27;s about shelf life. Both group chats and emails have a shelf life. Emails have a longer shelf life (probably up to 48 hours in responding and staying relevant in many cases) whereas group chat&#x27;s have shelf lives measured in minutes. Chat is great for quick one off&#x27;s, maybe even a few key people on hand, but not for extended groups. In fact, it&#x27;s rather terrible.<p>Nothing beats meetings with all the right folks, though. Meetings are much better than both group chat or email for spreading awareness. Actually, now that I write this, this might be a use of chat; a virtual meeting via chat. Though, I argue the utility is in having all the parties present and not the protocol.",1454194062

Either you&#x27;ve never seen a tempered glass surface, or you&#x27;ve never seen a road, or maybe you just have no idea why roads are built of the things they&#x27;re built of.<p>Asphalt is a pliant surface made of viscous hydrocarbons and filler that slowly stiffens up over a period of years.  You can scratch it, you can embed pebbles in it, you can heat up the center twenty degrees warmer than the edges, you can run a metal snowplow over it, you can press furrows in it until some parts of the road surface have 30 degrees of divergence from other parts of the road surface.  To some extent it&#x27;s self-leveling, balancing out physical distortion in one spot with physical distortion in another spot five seconds later.<p>The way you cut glass (at least, without a specialist sawblade) is by scratching it and then applying pressure.    The crack propagates and it shatters into two pieces.  This doesn&#x27;t work with tempered glass at all;  The surface is under so much tension that it tends to shatter into many pieces instead of two.  Roads don&#x27;t get scratched as exceptional events - it happens many times a day, with tires, steel bits hanging off, but most problematically, with quartz pebbles (harder than glass) embedded in tires.  Go look at your tires;  Rub your finger along the surface.  Now rub your iPhone along that surface.<p>Melting glass and transporting it in whole sheets is energetically very expensive.  Installation is extremely difficult.  Wear characteristics are not only unworkable, the glass would rapidly become frosted and translucent.<p>If it was economical to make roads out of glass, we would be doing it.  It&#x27;s not even economical to make them out of concrete except in isolated circumstances.<p>Roadway solar panels are a laughably bad idea.  Green inventors are condemnable when they waste our very limited enthusiasm for green ideas on obvious technical nonstarters.  I&#x27;ve been watching this space for more than a decade and I&#x27;m beginning to despair at the ratio of design/architecture student renders to even back-of-the-envelope engineering effort.",1454193742

However, bad news sells.  So, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything different.  There were some general non-negative articles (Whales dying on shores, LGBT laws gaining momentum). There was an absence of positive articles about India from a quick search.<p>By contrast, I looked at Australia in the New York Times.  Most of the articles were on sport and bushfires, so, there&#x27;s definitely a different focus and attitude.  Australia seems to be social events, India social unrest and injustices.<p>I consider the New York Times to be prejudiced at times though.  However, the article in question was well written, despite a lack of explanation of why there are less women in the Indian workforce than there were in the past.  One example of NYT prejudice I remember was about Australia&#x27;s first female PM, Julia Gillard.  The NYT described Australians (collectively) as misogynistic because we dared to criticise a female Prime Minister about her looks.  I searched at the time and found ONE media reference to a criticism from Germaine Greer - a prominent feminist - about Gillard&#x27;s fat ass (I saw &#x27;ditch the witch&#x27; after this article).  I contrasted this to other PMs: John Howard in a bondage pose with his nose up George Bush&#x27;s ass among many personal attacks on him (conveniently ignored), tony Abbott in his budgie smugglers and exaggerated lips, etc.  The NYT must have had very big blinkers (or my prejudice comment holds).<p>The reality is that India does bad things AND the media is very prejudiced.  I think the dismissal of prejudice in the media is dangerous.<p>Maybe, a letter to NYT suggesting some positive things in India may help raise awareness.",1454193341

So code that was originally a single stream of simple definitions becomes a complex mess where each line could have come from a consideration a week ago or a decade ago, and you can&#x27;t &quot;follow the train of thought&quot; that led to the current state any given function is in.<p>I think we need to think <i>very</i> differently. A truly aspect-oriented programming language, like Inform7 but not limited to the domain of Interactive Fiction, could allow for &quot;literate programming&quot; that treats a codebase as a linear narrative of feature additions, rather than a mutable graph representing current behavior. You&#x27;d actually be able to <i>read</i> a codebase from &quot;beginning to end&quot; and get a sense of what thoughts went into constructing it, in order.<p>Just reading git commit history won&#x27;t get you there. Commits aren&#x27;t the right granularity, for one thing—a log of merged PRs might work better. More importantly, git commits to a codebase are a mix of feature-commits <i>and</i> bug-fixing commits, which horribly muddies your vision of how each feature is defined. What you really want is for features to each be files, and bug-fixes to be commits to those files, such that you can read &quot;the up-to-date edition&quot; of each of the features.<p>Do note that we already have this in one particular place. This is how database migrations work. We just need code migrations! :)",1454192313

We can tax all incomes at fixed rate and be done with it.

11003999,comment,11000887,11002128,0,0,bsder,,,"> Sorry but that isn&#x27;t a replacement for Silicon, not by a long shot. You are not getting 14nm plastic transistors anytime soon.<p>You missed the point.  The point isn&#x27;t to replace 14nm transistors.<p>The point is to allow engineers to do VLSI design like PCB design.<p>There are lots of interesting things that can even be done with 5um or 10um transistors, but we can&#x27;t get there because the non-recurring expense is too high.<p>Here is an example: guitar pedals--specifically the analog delay ones.  These pedals all use an ancient MN3205 bucket brigade CCD chip.  The chip is dead simple to make, but since the volume is too low to offset the NRE, nobody is willing to make it.<p>If, however, you could design that chip with an NRE of $1,000 instead of $100,000, you could make a tidy profit.  In addition, you would probably pull all of the <i>other</i> functions of the pedal into the chip as well.<p>There are also other nice benefits to using older and larger transistors.  One of them is voltage tolerance.  Modern transistors can&#x27;t take voltages at even 3.3V in many cases, while the old 10um transistors could go to 18V (old school 4000 series CMOS was specified from 3V-18V for most chips).<p>The point isn&#x27;t to replace silicon transistors.  It&#x27;s to create a completely separate market at a different volume point.",1454191527

And you can even run DOS apps inside Windows 95, so you can have Virtual 8086 Mode inside your virtual x86 CPU (DOSBox) inside your JavaScript virtual machine, inside a sandbox...<p>Disk access here is fun through the sheer number of layers. Consider a DOS prompt inside 95. When a DOS application tries to perform an I/O operation, it will make a DOS system call. DOS, in turn, will call the BIOS. This BIOS call will be intercepted by Windows 95 which, since it has no 32-bit disk driver (DOSBox doesn&#x27;t simulate a real disk controller), will pass it on to DOS (the one underlying 95), which in turn will make a BIOS call. Everything before this point has been under DOSBox&#x27;s x86 emulation. We then go through to the C++ fake BIOS of DOSBox, which handles the BIOS call by calling the C standard library I/O functions. However, those have been replaced by emscripten&#x27;s shims, which will grab that data from the asm.js heap somewhere (or does it ferry it out to JS? I&#x27;m not sure.)<p>And DOSBox itself has been compiled to asm.js (which your browser may compile to machine code through JIT) and is running in your browser&#x27;s JS VM. Which, if the browser you&#x27;re using is on Windows, may be a 32-bit version, which is running under Windows&#x27;s WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit)...<p>The layers never end!<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/lcZZ5YU.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/lcZZ5YU.png</a>",1454191450

So you need a single-photon detector, a lock-in amplifier, a pulsed laser (50 or 60 Hz will give you a nice tone to listen for) and a reasonable size telescope. It&#x27;s a really small signal. But it could be done by a high school physics class if they were good at scrounging apparatus.<p>Edited to add: the laser power needed is a few watts average, and the telescope aperture needed is probably 30cm at least, with a tracking mount. Without a picosecond laser, you&#x27;re not going to be able to measure the distance accurately, but you could probably see a detectable line on a scatterplot or waterfall display.",1454191315

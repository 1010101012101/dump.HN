119414,comment,117949,118847,0,0,icky,,,"> It doesn't have to be entirely based on past performance - you could do some statistical analysis on the number of funds, which funds are associated with individual investors, fund returns and find whether the distribution of returns overlaps with the distribution that says ""the best funds were just lucky"".<p>Right, and as fast as you can generate that data, it immediately falls into the category of ""past performance"".  It's not a market problem, it's a philosophy-of-empiricism problem. ;-)<p>> What I am interested in knowing is whether the best investors are able to beat the market over time. And there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests this, for example (a rather extreme one, though) the best hedge funds which have generated an annualized 30% return over more than 15 years. With especially high returns when the rest of the world is tanking. Although this is an edge case, this kind of track record doesn't exactly scream ""lucky"".<p>Now, that part <i>is</i> a market problem, and for that, ""past performance"" really does come into play:  are today's best investors universally superior market animals, or are they just uniquely adapted to the current climate?",1203479242

I think that if all you teach someone is multiplication tables and long division/multiplication, then they'll be as lost without a pencil and paper as someone who doesn't know the tables is without a calculator.<p>I can see a case for learning mental math to solve small-number problems quickly, but really, anything I would want to do longhand, I (and most anyone else) would just use a calculator.<p>Really why I think long multiplication/division became popular? It's easier to grade homework. If a student hands in just the answers, who can say whether they did it in their heads or with a calculator?",1203479035

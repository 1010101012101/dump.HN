Feel like I connected people in a small way.<p>I know a few introverts who constantly connect with about a hundred contacts through Twitter (I was relieved when Twitter added the @filter)<p>Technology levels the playing field for making & building human connections (whether it is one-to-one, one-to-many, uni/bi-directional). Introverts can leverage technology to build and nurture communities. And, yes, make a living doing it.<p>And, I'm going to assume the extremely influential Daring Fireball's Jon Gruber is an introvert based on what I've read about him and his articles and the fact I've never really heard of him making public appearances.",1259081997

They are different philosophies, and solve slightly different problems. From a high-level ""I just want to use an operating system"", your basic interactions can be quite similar.<p>The most pragmatic explanation of BSD for Linux users I've seen is here: <a href=""http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/bsd4linux1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/bsd4lin...</a><p>That said, some things I like about FreeBSD that I didn't like about my favorite Linux distro, RHEL:<p>1) Ports (you can install packages, too, but I don't like waiting for someone to build one for me to download)<p>2) Clean and well-organized<p>3) Phenomenal documentation (RHEL isn't terrible here, I just feel more comfortable with FreeBSD's)<p>4) Less fancy extra features and such running out of the box (95% Personal preference, 5% security preference)<p>5) Less base-operating-system dependence on specific versions of languages (read: Yum/Python on RHEL)<p>Some things that caught me off guard:<p>1) Ports generally come with the software's default config, not a friendly config created by a packager. This ended up being better for me in the long run, but awkward and confusing in the short term.<p>2) BIND is not an uninstallable package from the base distribution.<p>3) No htop without the Linux compatibility layer, which I don't care to install.<p>I also haven't used FreeBSD on workstations, only on servers, so I am less demanding of comfort features than someone else may be.<p>I hope that's somehow useful to you.",1259081686

Apparently this is useful when engaging in various sorts of compile-time type system magic, where you have types that are used only for that magic and not because you ever expect to use a value of that type.<p>A grammar cleanup related to infix operators.<p>Add a standardized foreign function interface.<p>Another grammar cleanup: Haskell to-end-of-line comments begin with ""--"" unless that's part of a legal lexeme; it happens that colons are treated specially in the grammar, which mean that you couldn't make a symbol ""--:--"" because the ""--"" would always be parsed as beginning a comment. Not any more.<p>Guards in a pattern-match can now include their own pattern-matches; the guard fails if the pattern-match fails, otherwise it succeeds and the appropriate binding takes place.<p>Type inference is a bit more flexible (note: in practice most implementations behaved the more-flexible way already).<p>Document expected behaviour of the LANGUAGE pragma so it can be used portably to specify what language extensions your code needs.<p>Remove n+k patterns, which were always controversial.",1259081615

Quality matters, and defects can serious financial consequences (for instance, losing data can have a serious and measurable impact).  But in the trade-off between innovation and risk, I should probably position myself fairly aggressively.  Like most programmers, I'm in a position where it's probably better for me to make and recover from mistakes than to avoid mistakes altogether.<p>This is what I think the ""software is like building a bridge"" analogy is so inappropriate.  If you're going to hold software accountable for its relative lack of reliability, you should also acknowledge that the innovation from this field has been astounding.<p>Would licensing help things?  Would the space shuttle control system software become very reliable if only those software ""engineers"" were licensed?  I seriously, seriously doubt it.<p>But I do think that ""software engineers"" would slowly succeed in choking off a competitive and free environment.  In a nightmare scenario, you'd have to major in ""software engineering"" instead of math or physics to be legally allowed to write code, self study would be banned, and something like Ruby on Rails would be illegal because the people who wrote the EJB specs don't like it.<p>Look at the activities of the ABA or AMA.

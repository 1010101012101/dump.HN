The idea of a full plane ready-to-go save for a passenger who had no intention of showing up in the first place doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.<p>I&#x27;ve also had plenty of flights where I&#x27;ve timed it wrong and been sprinting to the gate with just under 5 minutes left on the clock. Sometimes you make it, sometimes you miss it. But the more common-place connection dropping becomes, the more likely the airlines are to close that gate at exactly 5 minutes pre-flight even with a checked in passenger unboarded, which makes flying overall just a little bit worse for everyone.<p>But on the whole, I despise the pricing games that airlines play a lot more than any hack a passenger can come up with to beat them at their own game. Trying to book a flight last week and it seemed like every single time I reran the search the prices were up again another $20. It&#x27;s definite race-to-the-bottom pricing strategies. I understand that as seats sell the lowest available price changes, but it seems like even existing inventory is being repriced in real time. I think the price for a specific seat should not be changing more than once per 24 hours, or better yet, once per 7 days.",1430560442

Complex financial systems are not new.<p>>I live in the UK and I am always perplex when I see how natural it is for people here to mobilise all their financial resources, bury themselves into debt through all the means possible in order to bid as much as they physically can on a house. And this is encouraged by the government who pushes for 100% LTV loans.<p>Guess who gets the government to push loans on people?<p>People take loans and buy a house because they&#x27;re told by those above them that it&#x27;s &quot;the responsible thing to do&quot;. This message is echoed around the media as well.<p>>One can blame bankers and speculators but I think this is missing the big picture here.<p>No, that <i>is</i> the big picture. <i>They</i> are the ones who benefit from an over-leveraged economy and they are the ones who are pushing for it.<p>Ordinary people certainly aren&#x27;t dying to drown themselves in debt, just as they weren&#x27;t the ones pushing for student loans.

My favorite example: a couple years ago when I was regularly flying in and out of DCA (from Kansas City), sometimes I&#x27;d take the direct flight and sometimes I&#x27;d take a connection in Charlotte. But several times when I took the connection, I&#x27;d arrive in Kansas City to find my bags waiting in the airline baggage office, since they&#x27;d taken the direct flight and arrived a couple hours earlier.",1430557239

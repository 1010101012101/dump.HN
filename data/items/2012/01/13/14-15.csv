(in the early days, Linus actually used to reboot to test the kernel, booting from floppy disks. I wouldn't have the patience)<p>Step 3: Configure and build the linux kernel from git master branch<p>Step 4: Make an initrd root filesystem, e.g. uClibC + busybox.<p>Step 5: If applicable, install a bootloader. Boot to your new kernel.<p>Step 6: Hack with the source and/or compile time or runtime kernel configuration<p>Step 7: Start over from the beginning but do something differently.<p>Steps 1-5 takes about one saturday afternoon. The faster your CPU, the less there will be waiting.<p>You have to start somewhere, so pick an area of interest and work your way around from there. Don't start in the beginning of the boot code, that's arcane magic that's not very useful for learning.<p>There are several books written about the Linux kernel, so you might want to pick one of those. Of course, printed material about the kernel gets old fast but the basic foundations have been pretty solid.",1326466736

3460734,comment,3460551,3460551,5,0,quanticle,,,"I want to make a small counterpoint. The reason it is so easy for developers to make products for other developers is that well, developers are more motivated to <i>learn</i> and <i>experiment</i> with new products. The old adage, ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink,"" applies fully here. A lot of people (maybe even the majority) simply will not invest one second into learning or trying a new thing, even if that learning will immediately translate into greater productivity for them.<p>EDIT: I should note that there are plenty of non-developers who are into learning new tools and new technologies and there are many developers who are extremely closed-minded regarding the tools they use. Regardless, I've noticed that in my personal experience, someone who develops software for a living tends to be more open to learning and using new technology than someone who doesn't. I don't think that's a controversial point.<p>For example, I know of people (and not just older people) who insist upon using only one tab in their web browsers. Keeping track of more than one tab is just ""too complicated"", and they can't be bothered. When confronted by an attitude like that, what can you do? Sometimes, it's just not possible for you to boil down a complicated concept into a simple default option for users. It's something that Apple and Google (with their multi-million dollar design budgets) have trouble with. As an ordinary developer at a small-ish firm, do I really stand a chance?<p>Another point is that I don't necessarily make software because I want to change people's lives. I make software because I like making software. It's my vocation, and my avocation. I don't always want to spend the time and research necessary to make whatever I've built easy to use. It's okay to have one-off projects. It's okay to build tools for yourself before building tools for others.",1326466287

I notice many people speaking out against SOPA on the web or on TV, that always start with ""While I do believe piracy is a serious problem,..."" - even though they don't really mean it, and they are just saying it because they are afraid of being seen as ""pro-piracy"".<p>And I agree with Tim O'Reilly that the vast majority of ""copies"" being pirated online, would not be bought if they had no other alternative. That's just part of RIAA's and MPAA's bogus claims that every pirated copy is a lost sale. It couldn't be further from the truth.<p>If you want to test this just compare a Netflix' user consumption of movies or shows, or a Spotify user's consumption of songs every month, to an iTunes user's consumption who spends around $10 per month, and you'll notice that the consumption of the Netflix or Spotify user is a lot higher than that of the iTunes user.<p>Why is this happening? Because as more content is available to them, they <i>will</i> consume more content, but they are <i>not</i> willing to spend more money on content. Limiting availability to more content, or in this case ""curbing piracy"", will not result in more sales and more money, because the user will not be willing to spend more than they were already spending.",1326465103

Restaurants, companies that sell products (online and offline), web design firms, etc.<p>These businesses impact the rest of society.  Real, everyday people buy from these businesses and often rely on them.  Your family interacts with them, understands them, knows them.<p>A startup is a game.  You play by the rules of the game.  You (traditionally) spend a lot of time seeking VC money, get enough VC money to spend the next few years working on whatever you want, regardless of the results, and then either sell the startup, get acquired, or shutdown (exit).<p>The players of the game are often the only ones involved.  They're the founders, the customers, the VCs.  The game has very little impact on the rest of society.",1326464013

Torrent files are still used to provide information on the download, they're just distributed from within the P2P network instead of TPB itself.

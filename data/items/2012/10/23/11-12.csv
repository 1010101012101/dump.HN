4687620,comment,4676505,4687387,1,0,paddyforan,,,"> thanks for asking me if I am ""familiar with the basics"" of a DHT.<p>I get the impression that you feel I asked this in a demeaning manner. I had no such intent. But some of your statements seem to contradict the fundamentals of a DHT, so I was unsure what level of explanation I needed to do. I meant only to gauge your level of prior knowledge, in order to engage you on that level. I apologise if I come off as brusque; everyone seems to be taking the fact that I did not use their technology of choice as a personal insult, so I'm growing weary of explaining why each individual technology is not what I wanted.<p>> Just to be clear, I don't think DHTs are the same as messaging systems. But, they touch on a set of related issues.<p>Agreed. To be clear: I released a DHT. I did not release a messaging system of any sort. I do intend to build a messaging system on top of it, but its uses are not limited to that.<p>> My assertion was that ""Just because software runs on multiple machines it does not mean that there is 'no SPoF'"". You seem to have read this as saying ""in all cases where there are multiple machines, there is always a SPoF"".<p>Not really. My assertion is just that any software that is built on a DHT and the principles behind it has no single point of failure. And if you were not referring to software built on DHTs, I'm not entirely sure how the comment is relevant to the discussion?<p>> In any case, I was trying to make a more general point, which is that (A) lots of cases which seem to have no SPoF, in fact do have SPoFs<p>I would argue that many of the alternatives people have proposed to me fall under this description.<p>> (B) some cases get accused of having a SPoF, but doing so is a mistake, and Rabbit is in this category because you can set up a number of multi-machine scenarios with the required redundancy<p>Redundancy does not make the SPoF disappear, it just manages the risk of that SPoF. Perhaps I am using the term beyond its meaning here (sorry!), but I think of this more in the architecture of the cluster. If traffic is routed through a small, centralised subset of machines whose specific purpose is to handle or route that traffic, I consider that to be a SPoF, no matter how unlikely that failure may be. I consider it so because rather than architecting your cluster to avoid issues, you are offsetting the issues to an ops/deployment problem. Yes, you can achieve HA, but it is not an inherent part of your cluster; it's bolted on afterwards by some clever duct-taping as you ping servers and swap them out if they seem to be down.<p>> (C) in many cases having a SPoF is not a problem anyway, and may even be a good thing.<p>A DHT is not appropriate for all cases, though I would challenge anyone to quote me on ever saying it is. I won't even say it's the best tool for the job I'm using it for; it simply is the tool that fit best with my desired approach to the problem.<p>> With all due respect this represents a misunderstanding of Rabbit.<p>This is entirely possible. I have a decidedly rudimentary understanding of Rabbit, something I tried to convey by qualifying all of my statements about it. ""From what I can see in the docs"", etc.<p>> Moreover you assert that 'there is a server' means that there is a 'single point of failure'. Because the conclusion does not follow from the premise, I assumed you must have meant something else.<p>In my understanding, the conclusion does follow from the premise: a server designates a machine that is specifically intended to handle requests. Clearly, I'm misusing the term SPoF. My apologies for the confusion caused by that. In the six months I worked on this, I never once had to explain why I thought a DHT fit my needs; I was speaking to people who worked with distributed systems, so no explanation was needed. This left me a little ill-prepared to explain myself.<p>> Perhaps you could explain why you think your system has fewer 'bottlenecks' than RabbitMQ or other messaging systems. I don't think that it does but would love to be enlightened.<p>It's entirely possible my system does not have fewer bottlenecks than RabbitMQ. Again, I'm no RabbitMQ expert. Here's why I think my system has few bottlenecks:\n* No change in code or deploy practices is needed between one server and one billion servers.\n* Unless a catastrophic event hits the cluster (an event that would leave your application non-functioning, even if Pastry continued functioning), the cluster will remain healthy as servers come and go. This is not a remedy put in place by ops, it is not a bolted on feature, it is a core premise of the algorithm. I prefer to solve my availability concerns at the software level, rather on the deploy level. This might be a virtue of the fact that my software is open source, so I try to make it simple for others to deploy. It might be a virtue of the fact that I am more familiar with writing software than I am with deploying software.\n* The messaging component is not an element in the architecture; rather, it is an embedded piece of every single element in the architecture that wishes to take advantage of it. There are no messaging servers, there are no brokers, no queues. There is simply your architecture, except now it can communicate efficiently.<p>Based on these three points, Pastry fit in with the approach I wanted to take in my architecture. It seemed like every other messaging protocol I could think of preferred to have a messaging server, instead. Even if you have a pool of these servers, allowing for HA through redundancy, that is not really what I was looking for.<p>> you seem to be saying that using a DHT is a good thing. Yes, I agree, sometimes this is the case.<p>We are in agreement, then. Examine your problem, then choose a tool for the job. A lot of people seem to be taking issue with the fact that I did not contort the problem until it fit pre-existing solutions, instead of creating a solution to the problem I saw.<p>> Are you familiar with how RabbitMQ does any of the following: clustering, HA, federation?<p>I am familiar with this page: <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html</a> In addition, I have seen this page: <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html</a><p>Both of them feel like a bolted on solution to the problem of distributed message passing, rather than an inherent design characteristic. Allow me to quote:<p>> some important caveats apply: whilst exchanges and bindings survive the loss of individual nodes, queues and their messages do not. This is because a queue and its contents reside on exactly one node, thus the loss of a node will render its queues unavailable.<p>This is understandable; queuing is pretty much impossible (as far as I know) to achieve in a distributed system. But I don't need queuing, so why should I let that hamstring me unnecessarily?<p>> should one node of a cluster fail, the queue can automatically switch to one of the mirrors and continue to operate, with no unavailability of service.<p>This does not feel like an inherent aspect of the design. This feels a lot like a deploy detail.<p>> In normal operation, for each mirrored-queue, there is one master and several slaves,<p>When I hear ""master"" and ""slave"", they translate in my head to ""bottleneck/SPoF"" and ""backups"".<p>> Clustering connects multiple machines together to form a single logical broker.<p>That sounds an awful lot like a single element in the system that is responsible for message traffic. There may be a lot of machines in that single element, but it is a single element nonetheless.<p>I am not saying that RabbitMQ is a bad solution for message passing, nor am I saying my problem couldn't be solved by RabbitMQ if I changed my architecture to fit Rabbit's needs. All I am saying is that I have a preference for architectures that does not take advantage of the things Rabbit does really, really well, and does take advantage of the things that a DHT does really, really well. So I'm more than a little confused that people are up in arms over the fact that I used the paradigm that matched my preference instead of trying to force something to do what it was not intended to do.",1350993554

My website seems to be handling the strain better than I'd expected, so I really have no excuse.<p>>$3 is also too low; you're likely to make far more revenue at $5 or $7.<p>I actually tested it at $3.99 when I first submitted it. Nobody was buying it at all, so I dropped it to $2.99 and quickly made my first few sales. It could probably also be attributed to my lack of a demo during this period, though, but I'm pretty certain the price drop had a non-negligible effect. Maybe $3.99 is just an ugly number?<p>>You also should make the intro more like 10 seconds long at most. Split the intro cutscene up and show it slowly over the levels.<p>This is honestly something I struggled with. I didn't want an overly long intro, but at the same time I wanted an intro that'd let the player know what's going on immediately. I couldn't find any other way to pace it, so I loaded it up front and towards the end with the meatiest part of the gameplay in the middle fairly uninterrupted. I probably did lose some of the customers who play games exclusively for the action, but my main goal was to make something that wasn't necessarily complex gameplay-wise, but had a decent plot to help string it along.<p>>* Shadowing is impressive!<p>Most of my initial criticism came from how I did shadows, but I insisted upon keeping them. I'm surprised I've actually received positive multiple comments on it.<p>>I wouldn't try to release quickly and barely test a project I've been working on for two weeks, let alone two years - something to keep in mind so you don't have to learn it the hard way like I (and many others here) did.<p>The main game's been extensively tested; the demo was rushed out because I didn't really plan on releasing one. Comments and criticisms will be immediately applied to the demo, but I'll slowly add them into the full game so that I have time to test them more fully. It's also a reason why cutscene skipping isn't in the full game yet--it can sometimes yield weird audio issues.<p>>In any case, great first project! Do you have a mailing list to sign up to? I'd be interested in hearing about whatever you come up with next.<p>Nope. I just infrequently update my blog. I only feel comfortable showing my work after I consider it complete, and it's definitely a problem because it's practically impossible to generate hype.<p>Something you didn't mention, but something I definitely need to work on, is my writing and organization.

Samsung and Apple have already been at this for over a year and a half (longer if you count their pre-lawsuit discussions).<p>Now, after we've been through lawsuit filings, discovery, back-and-forth over injunctions and a trial and gotten a verdict... The patent office turns around and says: ""On second thought, we shouldn't have issued that patent in the first place."", which itself will be reexamined and appealed and ... adding onto the existing pile of appeals.<p>I happen to think that the patent office's invalidation is correct, but even if you don't... this is no way to run a railroad. Successful reexaminations should be a rare, exceptional case in a properly functioning patent system. Instead, we have case after case turning on them (Oracle v Google, the Lodys reexamination requests, ...).<p>Here's a radical idea: Maybe the patent office should work harder to not grant patents it is likely to invalidate later.",1350990207

It managed to reach even at least one TED talk. Sounds to me mostly like front-end developers wanting to feel good that they're making difference when building cat-photo-sharing apps.

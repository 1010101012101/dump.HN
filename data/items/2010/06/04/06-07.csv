Lots of praise about how Google's leading the way, pushing browsers forward, and you really ought to give Chrome a try.<p>But when Apple does it? A barrage of complaints about how Apple doesn't support standards. It's laughable how transparently people are <i>looking</i> for something, anything to bitch about when it comes to Apple, no matter what they do.",1275634762

There is a good chance that everything shown there will be working across all the major browsers in a not too distant future. (Yes they have have to loose the vendor prefix -webkit first, but that is actually the recommended way to use non-finalized preview features of the emerging standards).<p>I see this as Apple pushing the html5 wagon forward, the same as the other major browser vendors do. Have you tried Internet Explorer 9 Preview demos in other browsers?<p>Finally the html standard is moving forward again after years of standstill. How anybody can complain about that is beyond me.<p>Cheers!",1275634596
1403690,story,,,5,6,apurva,"Ask HN: Addressing cold start problems in recommender systems?",,"Hi All,\nI have been working on a recommender engine for a while now and have now stumbled across the cold start problem. The problem here is that whatever data I collect is only an indicator of the likes of the user (for eg., if browsing history is taken as a source, then the basic assumption that people don't browse for what they don't like stands true)\nSo in such a case, any ideas as to how I train the system initially for dislikes?? I do know that the system will gradually tune to the user preferences with continuous feedback, but I would not like the first run to be very erratic either by choosing random dislikes...\nAny ideas folks??\nAny help in the matter is greatly appreciated....",1275634541

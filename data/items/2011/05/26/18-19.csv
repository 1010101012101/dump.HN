2588995,comment,2588185,2588924,4,0,nathanmarz,,,"Storm is a unified system. The key difference with other CEP systems is that Storm executes your topologies across a cluster of machines and is horizontally scalable. Running a topology on Storm looks like this:<p>storm jar mycode.jar backtype.storm.my_topology<p>In this example, the ""backtype.storm.my_topology"" defines the realtime computation as a processing graph. The ""storm jar"" command causes the code to be distributed across the cluster and executes it using many processes across the cluster. Storm makes sure the topology runs forever (or at least until you stop the topology).<p>(I can't say I'm intimately familiar with every CEP system out there, so feel free to correct me if there are distributed CEP systems. Those products tend to have webpages which make it hard to decipher what they actually are / do)",1306436371

These 3rd parties amass browsing habits and habits of visitors across multiple sites and topics. They use that information to build personalised profiles of an individual. This is done without the individual's consent. So the individual believes they've visited a set of independent websites, and they don't realise that some third party is watching over their shoulder.

New car manufacturers are practically impossible to build in the US (Tesla is the only new car manufacturer of note in decades, and it remains to be seen how well it will fare; Saturn doesn't count, as it's just a subsidiary of GM; AMC went under after a long struggle). Markets, in general, don't care if there's competition. Markets just insure that when a dominant player shows weaknesses, someone steps into the gap. That's happened with facebook; there are many social apps that tackle small bits of the problem (like Twitter).

Sure!<p>But be open minded: The real world is full of analytics, but for most of them you have to opt-in.

I don't want my girlfriend to know that I browsed a webstore for some medication a week ago. Analytics provider could know all that. And they can reassure that they will not use that information, but the point here is to prevent the accumulation of it in the first place.<p>What would happen if someone would hack an analytics provider, and put all this stuff online? Type in an IP address, and I give you all I know about that IP adress. Nobody is doing it, because the data is anonymous, so it's hard to cash it in.

Empty space isn't really a meaningful concept when you're dealing with field theories.<p>When you study quantum field theory one of the first mind blowing things that you learn is that an electron at rest can be thought of as a superposition of an infinite number of somewhat classical scenarios. For instance, the electron can shoot of a virtual photon, which creates an electron/positron pair, which annhilate and create a new photon, which is then absorbed by the original electron. These processes can be arbitrarily complex; just imagine substituting in the whole process we just described for the electron that was pair produced- you can do that as many times as you want. These things are all ocurring at once. This leads to the necessity of renormalization and in turn a great joke. What is positive infinity plus negative infinity?

Assembly certainly has its place, but arguing a kernel completely implemented in assembly is faster simply due to the abstraction level they're working on does not carry much weight. Of course you'll be able to find hand-tuned algorithms that are much faster in assembly than a higher-level language, but that does not follow that ""Complex software written in X is generally slower than complex software written in assembly""<p>Also, Lua is a poor example.

In recent years, the job demands have increased to the point that the hours are 60 to 80 per week plus travel, with no bump in compensation, and ever rising workload expectations.  Furthermore, the industry looks to be shedding jobs as they offshore more work.  I am seriously contemplating going independent and getting back into programming or package based consulting (I've done both), where I think there is more consistent/robust demand (vs Project Management - also, I observed that compensation is not substantially higher, if at all, for the additional responsibilities) for independents.  The average independent that I have hired has come close to, and quite frequently exceeded the compensation I was making before tax.<p>My problem is that it has been more than 10 years since I've done that sort of work.  I have saved enough funds and am very willing to quit and spend the next year or two retooling, working for low pay to gain experience.  I am not a complete noob in the IT market, but would like advice or insight on market trends and related skills (e.g. - and I am making these up to illustrate -  web design and programming are on a long term increase, and JAVA would be the right skill to pick up;  business analytics is up and coming, and SAS is the way to go)?  For context...I've spend several years mainframe programming, a few years ERP package solution consulting, and the rest as PM (certified PMP).<p>Also, I am thinking of moving from east coast to low cost city with high demand and lower cost of living (e.g. in Texas), with the intention of not traveling for work.

You learn the material equivalent to the four intro MechE (thermo, structures, fluids, and controls), but it is taught concurrently and totally integrated.

And each semester also has a culminating project which combines all of the disciplines as well.<p>That said, we call it unified because its actual course numbers are unwieldy (16.001-16.004); while the material is challenging, the real difficulty lies in having four classes thrown at you at once.

Since dict happens to be the next class in the MRO, this doesn't really matter for the purpose of this example, but I can envision a scenario where some plucky programmer inherits from both OrderedCounter and some other dict subclass, and the result doesn't work because OrderedDict does the wrong thing.<p>And OrderedDict isn't the only one.  Maybe for some reason I would like to have an OrderedCounter where all the counts default to 42.  So I do this:<p><pre><code>  class DefaultOrderedCounter(defaultdict, OrderedCounter):\n      pass\n  doc = DefaultOrderedCounter(lambda: 42)\n  doc.update('abracadabra')\n</code></pre>\nWhich results in:<p><pre><code>  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    File ""c:\python32\lib\collections.py"", line 507, in update\n      _count_elements(self, iterable)\n    File ""c:\python32\lib\collections.py"", line 63, in __setitem__\n      self.__map[key] = link = Link()\n  AttributeError: 'DefaultOrderedCounter' object has no attribute '_OrderedDict__map'\n</code></pre>\nWhoops!  Apparently defaultdict doesn't use super either.  Of course a better way to do this would be to subclass DefaultOrderedCounter and just override the __missing__ method by hand, but that's not the point.<p>The article goes into ""How to Incorporate a Non-cooperative Class"", which basically says ""wrap it up in a proxy class"".

There are two types of people that fall off the 2GB cliff.  \na) People who say ""what just happened... oh, I get it... 32-bits, memmapped files... I'll switch to 64-bit""\nb) People who say ""WTF.. #MongoHate.. going to blog about how @#$#%! a DB this is""<p>Some people understand the tools they work with.  Some people know just barely enough to throw things together and don't tolerate it when something doesn't work out of the box.  Worst of all, this second group tends to be very vocal on the interwebs.<p>I'd almost like to see 10gen not publish the 32-bit package at all.  Source is still there.  If you want 32-bit, cool, compile it.  But forcing the user to compile the 32-bit version assures at least a minimum bound of technical proficiency (an ""I understand what I'm doing, why it's not the default and what the limitations are"").",1352148994

Maybe there is a level of Mongo proficiency above MongoDB Master? I hope so.<p>1) Make sure to permanently increase the hard and soft limits for Linux open files and user processes for the MongoDB/Mongo user. If not, MongoDB will segfault under load and when that happens, the automatic recovery process works incredibly slowly.

We can get 90% precision or 90% recall, although not currently both at the same time, and it's the customers choice as to which to optimize for. We can just adjust a threshold to tune our system to their needs.<p>Companies that have high transaction amounts often use the machine learning system to detect likely fraudsters, but then have a human review each one and make the final decision to approve/deny. We have a visualization ""widget"" that shows the reviewers which signals made a particular user look suspicious. The advantage of using machine learning is then that you: a) catch fraudsters you wouldn't have noticed otherwise, b) don't have to review every single transaction, just the subset that are most suspicious, c) make it faster for your staff to review transactions since the visualization tools will help point them at what to look at.<p>Does that make sense?",1352148387

4745602,comment,4743425,4744545,2,0,mistercow,,,"So there are actually some countervailing forces at work here. On the one hand, people who have social status associated with ethical behavior tend to be more likely to act unethically (I wish I could find a reference for that offhand, but no matter).<p>On the other hand, self-image plays a pretty big role in determining behavior. Robert Cialdini discusses this at length in <i>Influence: Science and Practice</i>. He discusses several studies that demonstrate that getting someone to take an action that affects their self-image makes them more likely to make decisions corresponding to that self-image in the future.<p>For example, researchers divided home owners into two groups. Those in Group A were initially approached and asked to place three-inch signs in their yards saying ""be a safe driver"", and most of them complied. Group B was not approached initially.<p>A few weeks after that, the researchers went back to everyone in both groups and asked them if they would be willing to place a large billboard in their yard saying ""drive carefully"". They were shown a picture example showing a poorly designed billboard so large that it almost entirely obscured the view of the house. Almost everyone in Group B declined. The majority in Group A accepted.<p>The conclusion of this, and many other experiments is fascinating: people have a powerful drive to behave <i>consistently</i>. We are strongly repulsed by the possibility of hypocrisy. So if you change someone's view of themselves to fit a certain pattern, they will tend to continue to conform to that pattern in the future. So to some degree at least, giving money to a homeless person will create in you an internal psychological pressure to be <i>more</i> altruistic in the future.<p>And choosing not to give money because you think giving it to charity would be more effective may inadvertently cause you to incorporate ""cautious about donating"" into your self-image, and cause you to have more difficulty with future altruism. After all, what if you gave money to the Red Cross instead of the homeless person, and then found out that they weren't such a great charity after all? You'd look like a hypocrite for being cautious with the bum, but not with the Red Cross. Your brain is very good at anticipating ""I'll look like a hypocrite"" and avoiding it, even when the end result is worse for everyone.<p>Incidentally, if you find this stuff fascinating (or terrifying), I highly recommend Cialdini's book. But it might make you a little paranoid about salespeople and marketers.",1352147109

Its rare that PC games get slower, even if compilers change, because you don't keep recompiling it. However, if you make a JS game, that thing is interpreted from scratch every time its loaded. So if I make a JS game and ship it, the performance  characteristics have a higher chance of changing in unexpected ways on me long after I've moved on.<p>(Note: This is simply a response to this particular aspect of performance tuning JS, I am obviously not getting into the <i>benefits</i> of interpretation which may very well outweigh these costs.)",1352147100

Expensive gas is a major driver towards more fuel efficient cars, hybrids and electric cars. All brought to you (mostly) by a profit driven capitalist system.<p>The reason gasoline hasn't disappeared in favour of more environmentally friendly alternatives is that it's an insanely effective way of storing and transporting vast quantities of energy.

4745534,comment,4744393,4744393,1,0,mnicole,,,"If this post was more straight-to-the-point, I would have been in agreement with it. The problem with the metaphors here is that there are architects that are also good interior designers, just as there are developers who can implement good design. There's also resources for people that want to design their own house but need to make sure all of their bases are covered.<p>I would have phrased it more like: designers with project ideas are great, but their contribution is going to need be a lot more than just providing some PSDs and an image-only concept website. A big reason why I argue that people that design for web but don't code aren't really web designers (something I understandably get crap for) is because you need to understand the possibilities as well as the limitations if you plan on spending your time creating something truly worthwhile. Blog posts alone aren't going to keep you afloat on the state-of-the-industry, and can do more harm than good (i.e. the designer that says ""I know we can do this because there's a jQuery plugin for it!"" without understanding how it could impact existing code). The designer also needs to be able to answer questions that their mockups don't provide and be able to back up reasons why they made those decisions. You need to be able to iterate throughout the development process when something doesn't work as planned and do so alongside your developer, not just hope you're going to be able to nab one that is willing to both do the heavy-lifting on the front- and the back-end for you so long as you provide hugs and high-fives.<p>Anyone can come up with a static image of their dream app based on re-imagining favorite features from others like it. I just worry that if every designer with an idea thinks they deserve a pocket-programmer, we're going to end up with a lot more half-baked apps and services than we already have and a lot of unhappy developers who didn't know what they were getting themselves into. Something something everyone should learn to code.",1352146185

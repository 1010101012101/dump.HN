6205171,story,,,10,14,geuis,"Ask HN: Best ways to solicit donations for a free service?",,"I run http://jsonip.com. Its a free service, supports millions of daily requests, and something I really enjoy working on and maintaining. Server fees each month are only about $50 USD. I need to find a way of asking for some donations of my users or the service will probably be shut down for a while in a few days. I can&#x27;t afford to pay for the hosting right now.<p>Some important details: This has been a personal project and isn&#x27;t part of any commercial entity. In each response you&#x27;ll see a reference to getjsonip.com and jsonip Pro. This is an idea I&#x27;ve been looking at for a few months and only have been collecting signups. The server also hosts my personal blog http://geuis.com and a photo streaming site called Popped At (http://popped.at). Neither of those sites are commercial either and are just other sites I develop.<p>If it was just my blog and Popped At, I wouldn&#x27;t be posting this. But since jsonip.com is used by so many people, I don&#x27;t want it to go off air. In fact, I&#x27;m very uncomfortable writing this at all, but I don&#x27;t have any other options at the moment.<p>Can some more knowledgable folks make some suggestions for how I can go about this process? I have Paypal but have heard stories about how they shut down donator accounts. This is way too small for a Kickstarter campaign and isn&#x27;t really appropriate for that anyway. Lastly, I&#x27;d like to do this in a more or less transparent manner. I feel weird about asking people for donations that goes to run a server that also hosts my non jsonip.com sites.<p>Thanks.",1376395114

6205165,comment,6204843,6204843,1,0,shykes,,,"Here&#x27;s what I answered on stack overflow:<p>Docker is not a replacement for lxc. &quot;lxc&quot; refers to capabilities of the linux kernel (specifically namespaces and control groups) which allow sandboxing processes from one another, and controlling their resource allocations.<p>On top of this low-level foundation of kernel features, Docker offers a high-level tool with several powerful functionalities:<p><i>Portable deployment across machines</i>. Docker defines a format for bundling an application and all its dependencies into a single object which can be transferred to any docker-enabled machine, and executed there with the guarantee that the execution environment exposed to the application will be the same. Lxc implements process sandboxing, which is an important pre-requisite for portable deployment, but that alone is not enough for portable deployment. If you sent me a copy of your application installed in a custom lxc configuration, it would almost certainly not run on my machine the way it does on yours, because it is tied to your machine&#x27;s specific configuration: networking, storage, logging, distro, etc. Docker defines an abstraction for these machine-specific settings, so that the exact same docker container can run - unchanged - on many different machines, with many different configurations.<p><i>Application-centric</i>. Docker is optimized for the deployment of applications, as opposed to machines. This is reflected in its API, user interface, design philosophy and documentation. By contrast, the lxc helper scripts focus on containers as lightweight machines - basically servers that boot faster and need less ram. We think there&#x27;s more to containers than just that.<p><i>Automatic build</i>. Docker includes a tool for developers to automatically assemble a container from their source code, with full control over application dependencies, build tools, packaging etc. They are free to use make, maven, chef, puppet, salt, debian packages, rpms, source tarballs, or any combination of the above, regardless of the configuration of the machines.<p><i>Versioning</i>. Docker includes git-like capabilities for tracking successive versions of a container, inspecting the diff between versions, committing new versions, rolling back etc. The history also includes how a container was assembled and by whom, so you get full traceability from the production server all the way back to the upstream developer. Docker also implements incremental uploads and downloads, similar to &quot;git pull&quot;, so new versions of a container can be transferred by only sending diffs.<p><i>Component re-use</i>. Any container can be used as an &quot;base image&quot; to create more specialized components. This can be done manually or as part of an automated build. For example you can prepare the ideal python environment, and use it as a base for 10 different applications. Your ideal postgresql setup can be re-used for all your future projects. And so on.<p><i>Sharing</i>. Docker has access to a public registry (<a href=""http://index.docker.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://index.docker.io</a>) where thousands of people have uploaded useful containers: anything from redis, couchdb, postgres to irc bouncers to rails app servers to hadoop to base images for various distros. The registry also includes an official &quot;standard library&quot; of useful containers maintained by the docker team. The registry itself is open-source, so anyone can deploy their own registry to store and transfer private containers, for internal server deployments for example.<p><i>Tool ecosystem</i>. Docker defines an API for automating and customizing the creation and deployment of containers. There are a huge number of tools integrating with docker to extend its capabilities. PaaS-like deployment (Dokku, Deis, Flynn), multi-node orchestration (maestro, salt, mesos, openstack nova), management dashboards (docker-ui, openstack horizon, shipyard), configuration management (chef, puppet), continuous integration (jenkins, strider, travis), etc. Docker is rapidly establishing itself as the standard for container-based tooling.<p>I hope this helps!",1376395021

6205156,comment,6197823,6199714,1,0,vidarh,,,">  I&#x27;m not sure that MRI even allows for parallel processes in its green threads due to GIL?<p>The GIL has no relevance when talking about <i>processes</i>. The GIL affects simultaneous execution of <i>threads</i> on multiple processor cores. It also does not prevent concurrency for threads or fibers. What it <i>does</i> prevent is for two system/kernel threads to be executing the Ruby interpreter code itself on different processors or cores at the same time.<p>This is generally not all that big of an issue, as e.g. any C extensions that are thread safe can tell the VM to yield from the thread that calls it, and any Ruby thread that does IO etc. will also be put back in the waiting queue and so won&#x27;t hold the GIL.<p>> Other Ruby implementations might have different restrictions there.<p>jRuby, Rubinius and MacRuby are all GIL-less as far as I remember.<p>> Also, as Edward mentions in his post on reddit, speculative parallelism is a Haskell one-liner.<p>It&#x27;s a little bit wordier in Ruby, but not much. There may better ways of doing it, but this spawns the &quot;guess&quot; thread (g), then spawns an &quot;actual&quot; thread (a), that if it finishes first will kill the guess thread (otherwise the guess thread will already have terminated, and the &quot;kill&quot; will do nothing. The main thread then waits for the g thread to terminate, either with a result or because it was killed. We then just try to kill &quot;a&quot; because we know either g terminated first, or a terminated it after it had finished - either way a is not needed any more. We then return whichever thread local variable has content.<p><pre><code>    def spec guess, actual
      g = Thread.new { Thread.current[:ret] = guess.call }
      a = Thread.new { Thread.current[:ret] = actual.call; g.kill }
      g.join; a.kill
      g[:ret] || a[:ret]
   end
</code></pre>
This requires &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;actual&quot; to be any object with a call method, which includes Proc/blocks/&quot;lambda&quot; statements (or &quot;->&quot; in Ruby 1.9). E.g:<p><pre><code>   puts spec(-> { sleep(3); return &quot;GUESS&quot; }, -> { sleep(1); return &quot;ACTUAL&quot; })
</code></pre>
In MRI 1.8 this will only execute on a single core. In 1.9+ it can use multiple cores, but will be subject to the GIL. On Rubinius and jRuby etc. it won&#x27;t have to deal with a GIL. A multi <i>process</i> version would be immune to both. There are additional caveats to think about, like signals.<p>Of course this requires &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;actual&quot; to be thread safe.",1376394814
6205155,comment,6204322,6204322,5,0,7952,,,"In most practical ways Hyperloop is a train.  It has a fixed unchangeable route that can be blocked by a single carriage.  Without a massive network this will only be of  value to people who happen to want to travel that particular route.  The world has a long history of new methods emerging and they often fail in the long run.  In Britain we had a canal boom, then a rail boom, and most of those routes are now closed or obsolete.<p>It would be better to concentrate on increasing public transport in the road and air.  Build a separate road network for freight and coaches.  Make energy efficient airplanes that can fly short distances quietly and land on short runways.  Build systems to automatically route parcels to make same day delivery possible.  This would create a network that would be much more adaptable and complement what already exists.<p>Rail is like dial-up between a few key points that ignores existing networks that could be upgraded.

[2]  We could not afford to purchase or implement something larger, more garbage ticketing system, say like HP Service Manager (which has the worst interface of any web application I have ever seen mind you, but it is far more business-like for this enterprise-y world which the article is addressing).  We do, at a minimum, a Nessus scan for anything that requires FW rules inbound and/or a SSL cert in our org.  This did okay (other stories to follow).  Not soon after, many XSS vulnerabilities were found, in two versions. [3] This is, mind you, an enterprise-y ticketing system geared for people who do ITIL.  Not only could they not publicly manage the situation, they show a complete lack of change control/problem management their product and garbage webpage embue.  Now we only allow access behind our VPN; lord knows what would happen if we exposed this garbage to public Internet.<p>I give this example as one of my such tales.  Bottom-line: even some of the priciest web applications would fail even rudimentary testing.  We see it again and again, and there is always, rest assured, some marketing a<i></i>hole pedaling software to a non-IT manager, hooks them on it, and that guy refuses to accept how something so polished is dangerous to the bottom line.<p>Frankly, I wish SOX-like/HIPAA/bank/government regulations were imposed on all of us, and THEN fine any companies promising these standards for failure to comply.  The amount of garbage is staggering, and politics dictates software marketing will always target the guys sitting above the technical people who refuse when they know their product has &quot;rough edges&quot; (I say that because every company we talk to about such things downplays sec vulnerabilities; not once have I heard of one of our vendors handle it graciously, even big dogs like Symantec brush us off).<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=sridharvembu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=sridharvembu</a>

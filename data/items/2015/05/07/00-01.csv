That&#x27;s probably going to get you more money, too.<p>You could have four of these apps open at once, do you need quadruple insurance?<p>The app requires no interaction, and you perform no actions for the app until it notifies you about a pickup and Uber&#x27;s insurance kicks in.",1430960314

A part-time driver is likely to not carry commercial insurance, due to the expense and to hyperbolic discounting: I&#x27;d rather have $X more in my pocket now than protection from a possible lawsuit later. This results in cheap fares at increased personal risk to the driver, who often doesn&#x27;t fully understand that risk.<p>Also, these drivers have no ability to negotiate as a group, so they are at a disadvantage against a well-funded corporation that is quickly gaining market power and sets all of these terms.",1430960184

You have taken such a small part of what I have said and used it to paint me as someone who is taking advantage of the fact that Uber offers cheaper fares than a taxi service. And then to add salt to injury, you throw in that last line. While I agree somewhat with your point, your comment was just plain rude. There are so many other ways you could have said what you wanted to say without launching a borderline personal attack on me and trying to paint me as this horrible person.<p>Everyone can claim to be ethical, but at the end of the day whether you realise it or not, you&#x27;re supporting people in not only your own country but other countries through the purchases you make everyday, not necessarily in the best way either. That $5 coffee you might purchase every morning is benefiting people picking coffee in coffee producing areas of the world. Those same people are getting paid horribly, they&#x27;re also subjected to abusive work conditions bordering on fear tactics used to keep them working. You&#x27;re helping people support families, but it is a catch-22, you&#x27;re also not making things better either. So lets not get all self-righteous about this. Taking an Uber is no different than deciding to buy that new TV or pair of shoes.<p>That iPhone or Android device you probably own was made of components mostly manufactured in China at the lowest possible price to maximise the profits of a large corporation. The same thing, people working in those factories earning a few dollars per day (way below the poverty line) because they have no choice. The MacBook Pro or desktop computer is also made up of components built and assembled by people working in deplorable conditions for cents on the dollar.<p>At the end of the day Uber is a job. And while I do not agree with how Uber operates as a company or their misleading advertisements to get drivers, no matter if you&#x27;re choosing to take an Uber or a taxi, you&#x27;re putting money into someone&#x27;s pockets. It might not be the best way to help someone, but at the same time there are a lot worse jobs out there in the US and other parts of the world where working conditions are dangerous, the money is even lower and the hours longer.

There was only one volunteer from the rest of the conference - I think that if you&#x27;re not a native English speaker, and not familiar with American pop culture and history, Jeopardy questions can be mystifying - so I gladly volunteered to play.<p>To answer the obvious question: I lost. Badly. In fact, not only did I lose, I lost a full-cheating version of Jeopardy where the audience (participants from the conference) shouted out answers, and I buzzed in using answers I liked. Not only <i>that</i>, but some of the answers that the audience was shouting were taken <i>from Watson</i>, looking at the readout it showed of candidate answers. (Some of the people were able to immediately recognize the correct answer, even though Watson was unsure of it. But keep in mind Watson <i>came up with</i> those answers.)<p>I would have lost to even a decent Jeopardy player, so losing to Watson is kind of overkill. But I think I learned a few things about playing Jeopardy, and how the human experience differs from Watson&#x27;s experience.<p>I spent almost all of my cycles when the host was asking the question trying to figure out when he would stop talking. That is, I spent the entire question-asking period timing my buzz. I could not think of the answer and time my buzz simultaneously. The few times I thought I did know the answer, I did not <i>know</i> the answer when I buzzed in. I <i>knew</i> I knew the answer. The difference is that I did not have the answer in mind when buzzing, just that given a few seconds - which you get, by the basic protocols of the game - I could <i>come up with</i> the answer. I think other human players are the same: they spend the question-asking period timing their buzz, and are going by an intuitive feel for whether or not they know the answer. The actual answer recall does not happen until <i>after</i> they buzz in.<p>Watson is inverted. It only buzzes in when it is confident of its answer. In that sense, the game is not just about Watson winning the buzzer timing. Watson definitely <i>could</i> win every buzzer, but then it would lose the game; it&#x27;s not accurate enough to get every question correct. So if Watson won every buzzer, it would answer incorrectly many times, and ultimately lose.<p>With that in mind, I hope it restores some of the romance. During the test run, the category was &quot;Presidential Rhymes&quot; with the clue &quot;Barack&#x27;s pack animals&quot;. Watson answered &quot;Obama&#x27;s llama&#x27;s&quot; immediately. Me and the other contestant just stared at each other, slack-jawed. I had seen it done on tv, but there was something far more immediate and impressive, since the head systems designer was ten feet from me, and the Power7 systems just a few rooms away.",1430959329

(I usually read on the web or maybe do some light programming. I try to avoid heavy programming because too much mental effort tends to make it hard to get back to sleep.) When the nights get shorter, it becomes more likely that on a night picked at random that my sleep will occur in one contiguous block.<p>Most nights I sleep in a room much darker than most bedrooms because I blocked the window with opaque materials (Dennyfoil and aluminum-foil tape). That is relevant because the accounts of segmented sleep that I have seen or heard postulate that it is light pollution or in other words the invention of the light bulb that caused most people to stop waking in the middle of their sleep. Before I covered the windows with the opaque material, I probably slept right through the night even during the winter months. (I say &quot;probably&quot; because I&#x27;m not sure because it was about 18 years ago when I covered the window.)<p>I sleep one or two nights a week in a room (at my girlfriend&#x27;s place) with only ordinary blinds and consequently with much more light coming in through the windows, and I am just as likely to wake for an hour or (more typically) two there than I am in my much darker bedroom, which leads me to believe that it is mostly <i>habit</i> that decides whether there will be period of awakeness in the middle of any particular night. So for example, a person who is in the habit of sleeping through the night should not expect to shift immediately to a &quot;segmented&quot; pattern of sleep on his or her first night in a very dark room.<p>I should add that after the sun goes down, I usually employ measures (namely Flux.app and System Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts > Accessibility > Invert colors, a.k.a., shift-option-command-8) to minimize my exposure to artificial light that might interfere with my sleep.",1430959312

This was good for the company I joined as it&#x27;s a small startup.<p>I believe that the junior developers my company have hired have all been super eager to impress their bosses and learn new things while still having a huge passion and interest in coding. Whilst we have all been given some time to adjust to our project, we all quickly adjusted and were able to give be benefits very early on. I can&#x27;t speak for senior developers but these are the main advantages of junior developers.<p>With regards to relative inexperience of junior developers, I myself have only been coding for a few years now but I have a genuine passion for coding and go home and throw myself into it every night so I believe that I pick myself up there, someone else I work with has been coding since he was 10!! Whilst not having a lot of experience in a professional environment before joining my current company, in the last year or so, I have managed to learn a number of important tools for the job like: mastering linux, built a great knowledge of PHP, built a good knowledge of C, built a great knowledge of JavaScript, built a great knowledge of server administration and last but not least, improved my productivity by at least 10% by mastering vim.

That being said, is sticking cylindrical mac pros on their side into square racks really the best solution.<p>There are 2 problems I see with this design:<p>1: You are placing the Mac Pros on their side, which may lead to premature bearing failure on the main cooling fan. Apple designed the cooling fan to be as silent as possible, which means that they optimized the bearing and the fan to work in vertical orientation. Bearings designed for thrust (vertical) orientation may not work so well if placed horizontally for a long time.<p>2: You are fitting triangular shaped computers, wrapped into round cases, into square shaped boxes, resulting in significant loss of space density.<p>Considering that Apple is a huge company that owns huge data centers, combined with the fact that it would be simply stupid for a company who makes their own OS to run anything but that OS, and combined with the above mentioned problems with using Mac Pros as server &quot;logs&quot; (because you cant call them blades), I would assume that Apple has internally OSX servers designed in the traditional blade configuration.<p>They may not sell or advertise them, but they MUST have them. Given that you guys are buying a ton of hardware, and are located nearby, and would be actively promoting running Apple hardware, wouldn&#x27;t it be wise to at least approach Apple and see if they would be kind enough to sell you some of those blade form factor servers they simply must have.<p>I may be completely wrong here, but apple did brag about how Swift is the new language thats so flexible that you can make a Mobile app in it, or a Desktop app, or even a full blown social network. If that&#x27;s the case, they must have some plans for the server market? No?<p>Any way, in the end it&#x27;s a cool design, but I would seriously consider at least stacking the Mac Pros vertically to avoid fan issues. You can actually get a tighter form factor that way as well, unless space is not the issue.

I can tell you I prefer my soon-to-be-born daughter&#x27;s first kiss to my sister&#x27;s cheerful hello, but not by how much (how much &quot;what&quot;? What are the units?).<p>This has an answer, though, assuming you&#x27;re using an appropriately strict notion of utility function.  I do gather that &quot;utility function&quot; is used sometimes just to mean a function that reflects (deterministic) preferences, and making that cardinal has no obvious meaning.  But a utility function in the more strict sense reflects preferences over gambles -- and there are theorems[0] to the effect that, given <i>ordinal</i> preferences over gambles satisfying appropriate conditions, these <i>can</i> always be represented by a cardinal (real-valued) utility function, which is unique up to positive affine transformations.  In fact, the utility functions you get as a result of Savage&#x27;s theorem -- which I think makes for a better foundation, personally, as it doesn&#x27;t assume the notion of probability beforehand -- are always bounded.<p>(I&#x27;m going to ignore the notion of &quot;utility function&quot; as used by utilitarians.  That&#x27;s largely unrelated -- a fact which has caused no end of confusion -- and is truly ill-defined.)<p>Now, of course, it is true that actual humans do not have utility functions -- that is to say, they do not respect the conditions required to have one.  Any agent that somehow did, however -- not that such a thing can actually be built -- would be acting exactly as if it did have one, and it would be meaningful to speak of its utility function (up to a positive affine transformation), regardless of whether such a function were explicitly programmed into it.  Regardless, as I see it, if economists are getting decent results by approximating humans as having utility functions, well, good for them.  That&#x27;s not my area though, so I couldn&#x27;t say whether they are or not.  (Meanwhile, there have been attempts to modify utility theory to describe how people actually behave; prospect theory[1] is an example of this.)<p>But as to your question -- what do the numbers mean?  As I said, they reflect your (ordinal) preferences over gambles.  That is to say, if you have utility function u, and u(A)=10, u(B)=1, and U(C)=0, this means that you would be indifferent between a 100% chance of B, and a gamble where you have a 10% chance of A and a 90% chance of C.  Or, in other words, utility is that thing you&#x27;re maximizing the expected value of (if it existed, anyway).  Note that it doesn&#x27;t mean that you would be indifferent between some amount of A and ten times as much of B or anything like that; the numbers are purely about probabilities.  It&#x27;s not clear what that would even mean in general anyway (and real things have diminishing marginal utility, you know).<p>Note of course that no utility value is meaningful by itself -- again, utility functions are unique only up to positive affine transformations.  But if you have three utility values[2] a, b, and c, then the ratio (a-c)/|b-c| is meaningful.  Although, if you&#x27;re dealing with bounded utility functions, then you could always normalize so that the infimum is 0 and the maximum is 1, and then the resulting numbers would be meaningful by themselves (because you&#x27;d be implicitly setting c=inf and b=sup in the above).<p>This then (once we expand it a little) is the answer to your question &quot;What are the units?&quot;.  You ask this as if it were a strike against the notion, but in fact utility is more similar to conventional dimensioned quantities than you might realize.  The biggest difference isn&#x27;t, as you might suspect, that (as opposed to, say, length) it is nebulous and hard to measure -- it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s affine rather than linear!<p>Let&#x27;s examine the notion of &quot;length&quot; more closely.  Here&#x27;s the thing -- you can&#x27;t really directly measure lengths, either!  What you can do is measure <i>ratios</i> of lengths.  That&#x27;s why length is a dimensioned quantity -- when we say &quot;this has a length of 5 meters&quot;, we mean, &quot;the ratio of its length to the standard length &#x27;meter&#x27; is 5&quot;.  You can&#x27;t just measure length and get a number; you have to pick a unit.<p>Utilities, then, are similar, except that they&#x27;re affine rather than linear -- like, say, temperature, before the discovery of absolute zero.  These days of course we know that there&#x27;s such a thing as absolute zero and it makes sense to measure temperature on a linear scale, hence Kelvins; but let&#x27;s say we don&#x27;t know that yet and we just have Celsius.  This is an affine scale.  Unlike meters (or Kelvins), it doesn&#x27;t make sense to add two Celsius temperatures, or to multiply one of them by a (dimensionless) scalar, or to take the ratio of two of them.  It does however make sense to take the difference of two Celsius temperatures, and get not a temperature but a temperature difference.  (Which, again, today would be measured in Kelvins, but we&#x27;re ignoring that.)  It does make sense to add temperature differences, or to multiply them by scalars; and you can add a temperature difference to another temperature to get a new temperature, or you can take the ratio of two temperature differences to get a dimensionless scalar.<p>This is exactly how utility works.  Rather than picking one reference point (like a meter), you need two reference points (like the freezing and boiling points of water) -- these are the b and c in (a-c)/|b-c|.  If we are measuring temperature and we set c=freezing point of water, b=boiling point of water, then when we plug in the temperature a we want to measure, we&#x27;re now measuring it in... OK, not the Celsius scale, but a rescaled version that goes 0-1 instead of 0-100.  (Just as with lengths, we can only measure a/|b|; and if b is the distance traveled by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum, we&#x27;ve reinvented the meter scale.)  Whatever -- your reference points don&#x27;t have to be 0 and 1, that&#x27;s just convenient.<p>So what units are utility measured in?  Whatever you want, once you pick your two reference points.  As mentioned above, if it&#x27;s a bounded utility function, you have a natural two reference points in the infimum and supremum, but otherwise, use whatever two reference points you want.  Of course frequently this is just implicit -- you have some function, and somewhere it&#x27;s 0, and somewhere it&#x27;s 1, and those are your two reference points.  It&#x27;s just not that important a lot of the time!  A warning -- utility is often expressed in the undefined unit &quot;utils&quot;, but personally I think this gives bad intuition, because again, utility is affine, not linear; I think &quot;degrees utility&quot; might be a better term.  Of course, <i>differences</i> in utility are linear, and I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with referring to those in &quot;utils&quot;.<p>So -- while this is far from justifying the general use of the notion of utility, which, as you say, does not actually apply to humans -- I hope this answers some of your questions and shows that it&#x27;s actually on a much firmer footing than you imply (at least, as a description of abstract agents, rather than humans).<p>By the way -- notice how when I was looking for a physical example of an affine scale, I used temperature <i>before</i> the discovery of absolute zero?  (I mean, OK, I could have used position  -- as opposed to displacement, which is a difference in positions, and thus linear -- but I wanted to keep things scalar.)  The thing is that units, dimensions, are implicitly a statement of symmetry.  Before the discovery of absolute zero, temperature appeared to have a symmetry (translation symmetry) that it in fact does not.  When I say &quot;You can&#x27;t measure lengths, you can only measure ratios of lengths&quot;, I&#x27;m implicitly saying that if we scaled all the lengths in the universe by a constant factor, the result would be exactly the same.  And that was a statement that appeared to be true when we knew less about physics.  But these days, we know that&#x27;s not true for speed (because of the physically significant speed c); we know that&#x27;s not true for action (because of the physically significant action Planck&#x27;s constant, or its reduced version); and we know that&#x27;s not true for... uh, whatever the hell Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant G is.  And so by combining these we can see that it&#x27;s not true for length, either; the Planck length forms a &quot;natural unit&quot;, making actual lengths -- expressed in Planck units -- potentially meaningful, and not just their ratio.  So when it comes to physical things, what things are affine, what are linear, and what are dimensionless, well, it depends on the physics -- in a Newtonian universe things might be different -- and our knowledge of physics has changed over time.  Of course Planck lengths are not exactly convenient (and not as <i>directly</i> physically relevant as, for instance, c) so we continue to typically use meters despite the lack of actual symmetry; and in many ordinary cases the symmetry is still approximately there.  But utility really is only unique up to positive affine transformations -- you <i>are</i> going to have to pick two reference values.  (Though, once again, any utility you get from Savage&#x27;s theorem will be bounded, making for a fairly natural choice.)<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>: Just to clarify the above point about &quot;in a different universe things might be different&quot; -- if we lived in a universe where the only physically relevant constants were, say, the speed of light c, the gravitational constant G, the Coulomb constant k_C, and the Boltzmann constant k, then you could double all lengths, times, masses, electrical charges, and temperatures, and get an isomorphic universe; from inside, it would appear absolutely the same -- any actual measurement you could make would have the same result.  In fact, however, the Planck constant is also physically relevant, and since this change would quadruple all actions, it would not be a symmetry of our actual universe.  (And of course there are other physically relevant constants with yet other dimensions as well.)<p>[0]The VNM theorem: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenster...</a> -- for people who already believe in probability<p>Savage&#x27;s theorem: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/5te/a_summary_of_savages_foundations_for_probability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/5te/a_summary_of_savages_foundations...</a> -- does not assume probability, constructs it together with utility<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory</a><p>[2]By which I mean values that &quot;have type &#x27;utility&#x27;&quot;, not necessarily outputs of the utility function; for instance, a supremum of outputs of the utility function would certainly count.",1430957649

Which gives Uber an unfair advantage over the competition (regular taxis that do respect the law ). It&#x27;s like saying employer X doesn&#x27;t check if his employees are legal workers, because if he did it would be too expensive to do business.

It doesn&#x27;t even have to be a major change, but something like rearranging ports, adjusting taper or extrusions on the chassis, etc. Those kinds of adjustments happen all the time on consumer hardware, and most people don&#x27;t notice, but may be an issue if you&#x27;re trying to fit into precision machined slots.<p>> Hardware will almost always cost less than engineers.<p>For commodity, off-the-shelf hardware, absolutely. This is anything but, and still requires engineering effort to design, fabricate and assemble. And it&#x27;s not always about the immediate dollars: sometimes a fundamental reworking means sacrificing short-term savings in favor of the long-term: flexibility, risk mitigation, reduced operational complexity, and cost over successive generations of hardware.",1430956929

You still have to decide who gets what, how they get it, who works on what, how to motivate them... You just do it directly instead of detouring through the abstraction of money and prices.<p>Getting rid of the intermediate pricing abstraction doesn&#x27;t magically solve the underlying problems. Perhaps it lets you address those problems more directly, but it&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;s a better approach—as programmers and computer sciences we should appreciate the power of abstraction and indirection to make solving problems <i>easier</i>.<p>The same energy would just have been spent in committees.

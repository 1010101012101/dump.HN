2199746,comment,2197531,2197757,0,0,spiralganglion,,,"I started 3d animation as an autodidact when I was 11 years old (now 24). I've spent over a year each in about a dozen different packages, with the majority of my time and effort poured into 3D Studio Max, Maya, and a little-known Mac-only package called Pixels:3D Studio (anyone else here use it, back in the day?).<p>Just this past week, I've started on Blender. I've been following it loosely since the late 90s, but this was my first real go at becoming proficient. I first tried 2.49, but found it <i>extremely</i> aggravating. Moving to 2.5 was a tremendous improvement, making Blender's unusual workflow slightly more obvious, but there's the rub.<p>Blender, in its origins, was designed with a very different set of basic interactions than the leading 3d animation packages. In time, as they've added more features, they've slowly moved the experience to be more in-line with Max and Maya, but these alignments apply pretty much exclusively to the newer, high-level features. The core interactions for moving/rotating/scaling, viewport movement, selection, and other ""basics"" are completely different.<p>If anyone else is just picking up the program, I'd encourage you to share any good resources or tips you've found for overcoming the initial grind. Here's what has helped me most:<p>Take notes of all the keyboard shortcuts you encounter. Sure, there are existing lists and cheat-sheets, but writing them out has <i>really</i> helped me memorize them. As I'm following the BlenderCookie videos, I watch for the interactions I don't yet know and immediately jot down the details. Don't forget, many of the commands are highly context-sensitive.",1297292262

College is designed to provide you with an education both in the classroom and outside of it.  If you have the drive I definitely recommend attending one of the really great schools you mentioned above.  However if making the grades is going to take everything you have and leave no time for anything else then I recommend you reconsider even if you do get in. My take on college was that I got a lot more from the experiences you have outside of the classroom than you ever will in it.<p>I believe if you are smart enough and talented enough to attend a prestigious school like those you mentioned then you shouldn’t worry about the debt you might graduate with.  Smart and talented people can overcome their educational debt and the value that comes along with being a graduate from one of those universities in the long run will more than return.<p>In my own experience I had a chance to attend Duke, however I know that making the grade there was probably more than I was up for at the time.  So I want to a less academically challenging school (Arizona) where I could be on the west coast and excel in the classroom but still have the time to really enjoy everything college had to offer.

They may not run full power all the time anyway.<p>Regardless, it's generally the responsibility of the receiver to ignore signals in another part of the same band, and this is a different band entirely. Perhaps some receivers are built as cheaply as possible and don't have the best filters. If they all break, well, their customers should know not to trust that brand again. Any other policy amounts to no one ever being able to establish new radio service on its own part of the spectrum, on the theory that some other defective other equipment might fall over.<p>Personally, I think it's far more interesting the prospect of having a network of 20,000 steerable-beam transmitters approved for 15KW ERP each at 1.5GHz. 300MW is about half the output of a typical electrical power plant. If those were networked that could make one hell of an antisatellite weapon, phased-array radar illuminator, or maybe even an SDI-type directed energy weapon.<p>If the military isn't behind this, well they should be. <conspiracy theory>Maybe that's why the FCC is fast tracking it so much.</conspiracy theory>",1297291587

Go cheap otherwise.<p>Most of the advantage to an elite college accrues to the very top - Harvard, Stanford, MIT.  If your choice is between, say, NYU or Hampshire or BU and a state school with in-state tuition, the state school is probably a better value.  If your choice is between, say, Stanford or Amherst or MIT and a state school, going to the big name school can result in earnings that pay off the cost of it within 5 years.<p>Also, many of the top-tier colleges give very generous financial aid to middle-class families, so you may find it's not all that much more expensive than a state school.  My actual tuition at Amherst College was less than sticker price at UMass Amherst, though of course I would've gotten a full-ride on merit scholarships at UMass.",1297291219

We're asked to consider how much of a 'hot hand' is attributable to chance, and how much to skill. But what is chance in this context? Clearly he doesn't mean the likelihood of a ball launched in an arbitrary trajectory finding its way to the basket. More likely, he means the shooting average of an average basketball player in the type of game being observed (pickup game, college, etc). Clearly skill contributes to such a baseline average.<p>With basketball we have a skill that can easily be measured for nearly anyone: we just have them toss a basketball a few dozen times and we have a good gauge of how skillful they are compared to others. But what about, say, a venture capitalist? The game that they are supposed to be skilled at has so much overhead that very few are ever played, and not all those that want to play can (you've got to have a lot of money to even sit at the table). It's quite possible that success as a VC is entirely attributable to luck, with no contribution from skill at all. For these kinds of activities we have no way to generate a meaningful statistical baseline. We can only engage in a thought experiment: if hypothetically the success in question was actually due solely to chance, would the world we see look any different?",1297291140

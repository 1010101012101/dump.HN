There are way too many mediocre papers that get into conferences I care about even when the acceptance rate is low. Also, the surge in papers submitted from China has pushed everyone's acceptance rates down, and quality isn't necessarily getting better. Disclaimer: I'm submitting from china these days.<p>In computer science, if you look at low accept conferences like OSDI/SOSP (systems), you'll see some safe (uncontroversial) papers getting accepted but most of them are just good and interesting. Now, compare that to CHI where the accept rate is still competitive but the quantity is huge. The quality there seems much less consistent.<p>When I review for conferences these days, I'll get a stack of papers where one or two are obvious good, one is controversial that we argue over, and 17 get binned after 5 minutes (the rest if the time you spend on the paper is just to give the authors useful feedback).",1364633930

5464878,comment,5464311,5464511,4,0,vacri,,,"Find a friend who really knows their guitar, and buy them lunch in exchange for a run-around of the second-hand and/or pawn shops. If you have gobs of cash to spend, sure, buy an expensive new one, but you can find decent guitars for cheap in the secondhand stores. I got my guitar (a kramer zx30) this way from a secondhand store that sells on consignment.<p>If you're going to get a cheap new guitar, again, take that friend if you can - cheap guitars can have a number of problems - the first one I ever tried couldn't even hold its tuning during the six-meter walk from behind the counter to hand it to me :)<p>I'd certainly recommend the lower end of the price spectrum and not the high end - what if you buy a pricey acoustic but the stuff you want to play turns out to be electric? Or vice versa. I thought I liked acoustic more and ended up loving the electric much more. And when you're learning, you really can't tell the subtle difference between models - slapping down a ton of money to find out it's not quite what you want might be a little off-putting.

The lack of this basic key, year after, is idiotic.<p>So with the ever-diminishing value of physical media, what does Apple do? Put a dedicated Eject key on its keyboards, instead of Delete. And on the Air?  Why no Delete key?  And to make matters worse, you can't even remap Eject to be Delete, because Apple even more idiotically put a HARDWARE DELAY on the Eject key. Why? Because of all the fatal accidental CD ejections? If this is such a problem, why didn't they put Eject on some other key as a secondary function?<p>They pulled the same shit with Caps Lock: It doesn't work half the time, apparently because Apple put the same asinine hardware-delay BS on it for no apparent reason.<p>I contributed the ""F12 to forward delete"" hotkey to KeyRemap4MacBook, so you can stand using these things.

5464822,comment,5464311,5464511,1,0,sfrench,,,"First off.  You can learn on anything, so get whatever guitar you feel most comfortable playing (comfortable playing is the utmost requirement here).  You absolutely have to go to guitar stores and have the guitar in your hands and in your lap.  If you can't play, make sure to take a friend that can, as they'll be able to tell you if the guitar is ""meh"" or not.<p>Spend as much as you comfortably can, but don't kill your bank account.  If you can, $500-$1000 is a good range and you have lots of good-quality options in both electric and acoustic.<p>I'm totally biased on the electric/acoustic debate.  I've played almost exclusively acoustic for 20 years, and obviously prefer them.  So from here, I'll dive into acoustic specific stuff if you decide to go that way.<p>Size/Nut Considerations:
Two important things to pay attention to are the body shape/size (Dreadnaught/OM/000/00/ etc), and the width of the fingerboard at the nut.  These are just some huge generalizations, but if you play a lot of fingerstyle, a OM/000 with a 1 3/4"" nut may be what you're looking for. Whereas if you like playing bluegrass, you'd probably like a Dreadnaught with a 1 11/16"" nut.<p>Woods:
In addition, pay attention to woods the guitar is made of. Spruce and Cedar are going to probably be the two most common top woods, and Rosewood and Mahogany are going to be the most common back woods. Make sure to play combinations of these woods and figure out what you like.  Most importantly, if you are paying more than $500 for a guitar, make sure that the top, back, and sides of the guitar are made of solid wood (no HPL, carbon fibre, laminates, plastic, etc.)  If you are spending less than 500, make sure you at least get a solid top on the guitar.<p>Suggestions:
In the 500-1000 range check out Loar, Recording King, Blueridge and Larrivee guitars.  I've also heard good things about the Epiphone Masterbilt guitars.  Some specific models to check out:  Loar LH-250, Blueridge BR-140 (or BR-160), Recording King RD-310, Larrivee OM-03, Martin MMV (if you can find one), Martin 000-15 (or 00-15 or OM-15 or D-15),<p>In the 1000-2000 range Martin 18-series, Taylor 300 and 400 series, and Larrivee 5-series guitars are great choices.  Some specific models to check out: Taylor 312/314, Martin OM-16GT. Martin OM-18 (or D-18)",1364631113

5464819,comment,5464311,5464726,3,0,dombili,,,"I agree with some of the things you've said. I actually ordered myself a Fender Jazz Bass just yesterday and I've never even played any type of guitar in my life.  But even though I went with that ""buy the expensive guitar then it wouldn't be easy for you to give up on it"" route, I don't necessarily think that's the only way to go. I live in a small town where I don't have the option to test a lot of guitars and see whether they sound good or they're a good fit for my hands (plus I'm left handed so that doesn't help). If anyone lives in a big city where there's a big music shop, I think the safest and the cheapest way to go is to go to that shop and try as many instruments as possible.<p>Just because you pay a guitar more money than the other one, it doesn't mean the expensive one would sound better than the cheaper one and most importantly it doesn't mean you'd be comfortable playing it.<p>However, if you don't have an option to try different guitars, Fender is the way to go. Their Standard Mexican made model Strats are not that expensive, in my opinion.",1364630805

Some of the data doesn't line up with our (match + okcupid, etc) internal estimates/figures. For example, our estimates are closer to 50% of US have tried online dating, and 50% havent; significantly lower than that in other geographies.  The idea of serendipity is definitely a real issue, and a frustrating one, because just the concept in people's minds and expectations alone prevents them from trying solutions that might work for them.<p>The simple fact is that, for most people finding work is just like anything else: it takes a little bit of attention and work to find the best person for you. That's not romantic, but its real.<p>I'm not sold that the solution is having your friends help you create a profile, introduce you to their friends, or attest for you. It seems like a lot of work for them, to be honest, with very limited returns. At the labs, our minds are focused on finding the future of dating in mobile, big data, leveraging social networks, and discovering how to create serendipitous connections through the above.<p>To the OP -- if you want to chat, hit me up; would love to chat. We're in SoMa.",1364630786

Future behavior and circumstances are not predictable or controllable to that extent, no matter how good the admissions process is.<p>Regardless, the goal of admissions is not to pick the exact top students, but to create a solid class. That may involve taking some chances on kids who provide diversity or experience in areas other than pure academics. If those kids fail, it is not error, but intentional risk. Even the ""best"" (whatever that means) kid carries some risk, and may fail due to personal or incidental circumstances that could not have been known during the admissions process.",1364630738

A few years a decided to ""upgrade"" with an $1800 Taylor. It's not a bad guitar, somehow the cheaper one is just more fun to play.<p>If I had to draw a lesson from this: when you play a guitar you will have a ""feeling"" about whether you like it, and I think that's the most important thing.<p>Which also means don't buy a guitar without playing it!",1364630668

5464810,comment,5460988,5464740,5,0,c0t0d0s0,,," When i leverage the copyonwrite-ness (which is more redirect-on-write) of the filesystem to recover from a defunct state of the on-disk state to a known state, a filesystem check is just a suboptimal solution. That what i wanted to express with the article. Of course - most filesystems are not COW and can't use it, and thus the notion that  a filesystem check is needed prevails. But at the end a filesystem check is just about forcing a filesystem into a state of metadata correctness, without caring much about the data.  I wouldn't count that as a way out, when there are better ways.<p>I think the situation is pretty much similar to the ""shoot the messenger"" problem of ZFS. Some people are annoyed that ZFS reports errors because of corruption and blocks access to the data (of course without having any redundancy). However the alternative would be reading incorrect data. What's worse. Knowing that you have to recover data or processing incorrect data without knowing it.",1364630455

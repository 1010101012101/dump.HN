Good job!<p>Some feedback from someone who is also working on a subscription service based on cloud computing magic:<p>- Realistically, charging $20 - $40 a month means you&#x27;ll need a lot of customers to signup to make anything significant in revenue.<p>- Acquiring new customers might be difficult for this type of service because direct sales would be too costly to make a profit.  You would definitely need to run ads to gain a large customer base.<p>- If you run ads you&#x27;d have to position it as an up-time monitoring service since the volume around searches for automated headless browser testing solutions isn&#x27;t going to be high.  The cost of acquisition through marketing will be pricey especially since you offer a free plan that offers what most people would need.<p>- The Chrome extension is super cool and very impressive, but I think the average small business owner might be intimidated by all the javascripty things you throw at them on the landing page.  A good tagline might be along the lines of &quot;Know when something breaks on your site&quot;<p>- You will spend a lot of time answering support emails.<p>- I can see this service really taking off if you find a way to bundle it with an eCommerce shopping cart.

7641250,comment,7639214,7639907,3,0,timtadh,,,"Armin, my feedback is in the form of my own version of this library.[1] I have been working on this on and off for some time and like you have not made a release. That said, I have been using it quite a bit both in my research and at work and I think it helps.<p>The main idea behind it is make it easy to write a &quot;getopt&quot; style program with arbitrary command nesting. I have found that although argparse and sisters are nice libraries they don&#x27;t allow me to do many of things I like to do in my interfaces. For instance sometimes like options such as<p><pre><code>    foo -x a -x y -x q ...\n</code></pre>\nwhere I would process that into like so:<p><pre><code>    extras = list()\n    for opt, arg in opts:\n        if opt in (&#x27;-h&#x27;, &#x27;--help&#x27;,):\n            util.usage()\n        ...\n        elif opt in (&#x27;-x&#x27;, &#x27;--extra&#x27;):\n            extras.append(validate_or_die(arg))\n</code></pre>\nI also believe that you should have &quot;fast fail&quot; validators. So I have several in `optutils` which are like:<p><pre><code>    util.assert_dir_exists(path)\n</code></pre>\nwhich if a directory doesn&#x27;t exist on the path it creates it. If there is already a file there and it isn&#x27;t a directory it dies with an error. When it dies, I try and have unique exit codes for various errors (for testability) and provide usage information immediately. This style is nice because it provides immediate feedback to the user with no fuss. I think a lot of &quot;option parser frameworks&quot; miss the point in having lots of things for parsing ints and things. Most of the time I deal with files, directories, and &quot;string&quot; parameters which these libraries don&#x27;t help with.<p>In general, the standard libraries make it way to hard to write really nice command line tools. I like some things about your library, but I think that you need to increase the flexibitly for how options are processsed to you can do whatever you want with them. I also think that option parsing and configuration should be integrated. I am working to support that but I am not there yet.

The overwhelming majority of people (i.e. potential customers) with conditions that would benefit from stem cell treatments are old people, and thus large sections of the research community are working on understanding and manipulating the activities of stem cells in old tissues to try to (a) figure out exactly why they are not working as well as they used to, and (b) restore them to action.<p>There are some interesting experiments in heterochronic parabiosis that are worth looking into, but also many other lines of work in which researchers are identifying specific signal proteins that direct stem cells into ever greater quiescence.

If employees are expected to give their notice, and put up with their employer in the same way as they have for the normal duration of their employment, then that is a burden since the employer does not have the same social expectation when <i>they</i> are letting the employee go.<p>The employer can say <i>You wouldn&#x27;t walk out on us now, would you? That would be a dishonourable thing to do</i> (probably in a less direct way). An employee doesn&#x27;t seem to have that same kind of social more leverage.<p>EDIT: This includes the circumstance that you mentioned - the employer is being somewhat unreasonable - since they can still guilt the employee into pushing through it. Another thing to consider is that, while the employer might not be treating the employee worse than he used to, the fact that the employee feels that he has to stay for the extra two weeks may be an inconvenience to him.

Anyone can understand how one piece of code works, even if it&#x27;s fairly complex.  A good programmer can understand how one very complex piece of code works.  However, any modern codebase of any significance is impossible for <i>anyone</i> to understand as a single monolithic whole.  The key ability is to create a clean mental model of each piece, even if the actual implementation or interface of that piece is nowhere near so clean, and put those models together to understand all the &quot;between the cracks&quot; stuff.  That&#x27;s the key bit of genius behind BitTorrent, for example.  It&#x27;s not that the individual pieces are so special, but that the emergent behavior of those pieces interacting with one another is very beneficial.",1398355847

Second, it doesn&#x27;t cache the authentication.<p>Perhaps nginx might instead check all requests for a particular signed cookie, verify the signature, if the signature matches, verify that the cookie isn&#x27;t too old, and then unpack variables from the cookie that the application server might want, such as REMOTE_USER.  It seems nginx would then want to freshen-up the cookie.<p>If the cookie doesn&#x27;t exist, signature doesn&#x27;t match, or the cookie has expired, then, nginx should proxy the request to a delegate... but, it should return the results of that delegation directly to the user agent.  It&#x27;d be the job of the delegate to set/sign the cookie with the information needed when authentication succeeds.<p>In this way, the authentication agent has full control over the process (so it doesn&#x27;t have to be in nginx), and, heavyweight authentication is cached.<p>EDIT: Thanks mixedbit -- you&#x27;re correct that nginx will forward 3xx onto the client.  However, I recall patches are needed to support headers; and, without 200 going to the client, how do you support LDAP form authentication?

The idea is that it&#x27;s more productive to pay during and after a career (when one has money) than before a career (when one is broke).  Long term thinking like this built American into an industrial superpower, but short term thinking is giving us.. well, something else.<p>For example, land grant colleges were set up so that farming profits paid for the next generation&#x27;s education.  We&#x27;ve largely replaced that with student-loan debt based education, which sets graduates back for years or even decades.  Now we have a stagnant economy where most people are struggling to get by instead of making meaningful contributions that increase their wealth and ability to pay/donate down the road.  The founding fathers knew why public education was so important, yet at every turn we see people constantly attempting to privatize and marginalize it.

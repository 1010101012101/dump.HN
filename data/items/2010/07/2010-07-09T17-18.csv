Experts and mortgage companies now agree that real estate payments greater than 31.1% should be avoided at all costs.<p>She's a social worker, not comfortable with finance.  She had little desire for other life comforts other than a home.  She sat down, realized that she could make the monthly payments, and thought it was safe since the market continuously kept going up.<p>If someone had been there to tell her that the home purchase was too high given her salary, she would have thought differently.",1278698396

I considered that, but it doesn't have as much of an impact factor on the user, which is really important for getting the word out about performance (why the site exists in the first place).<p>I probably doesn't matter too much as long as you have a ~3Mbps connection or higher (see Mike Belshe's ""Effective Bandwidth of HTTP"" graph on <a href=""http://www.belshe.com/2010/05/24/more-bandwidth-doesnt-matter-much/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belshe.com/2010/05/24/more-bandwidth-doesnt-matte...</a>) because the TCP transmission rate can't ramp up high enough on each object to saturate the connection. It's possible, however that the objects will interact with each other by causing differing queueing latency and possibly loss in the bottleneck router and by changing the order of scheduler events on the client OS.

If you're a creature like, say, a human, who is pretty much outclassed by every critter out there in terms of physical prowess, then the people most likely to survive are the ones that are good at hunting.<p>The ones that hunt only up close don't need as much precision as ones who hunt at a distance (thrown spears, bow & arrow, that sort of thing), but having good depth perception will give a hunter a survival advantage over someone who does not. So, members with better binocular vision will tend to survive longer than ones who don't.<p>With today's agriculture-oriented societies, the hunting advantage isn't as critical to survival, of course.",1278698354

The only thing I can find that could cause this is that I've posted 22 comments while others have consistently posted more.  My ""average karma"" is nil, and I assume this means I haven't posted enough to begin its tabulation, and I remember recently PG said something about revamping comment ranking to include this statistic.<p>I can understand a sort of ""probation period,"" in which new users are expected to spit out solely inane things, but I have a number as low as 22 because I generally only comment when I feel my comment seriously adds to the discussion, and (I feel) not because of a lack of familiarity with the community.

1501513,comment,1499921,1499921,0,0,jmcentire,,,"People adjust very quickly and easily.  Much of the inefficiency the commenters on this thread observe are either the result of intent or indifference.  We've had the technology for years to make for ""better"" traffic flow.  Studies have been done which demonstrate local maxima which aren't adopted by municipalities.  The main barriers are archaic ideas based on felt truths and the profit motive.<p>Many city planners believe that stopping traffic frequently makes the city safer.  This isn't true, of course.  But, it seems true and it's easy to believe.  If a city timed major traffic ways properly, it's been shown that accidents are reduced.  But, facts are so inconvenient.  Rather, lights are timed poorly which causes greater pollution and tension.  The drivers, seeking a more optimal path, start taking side roads and neighbors complain.  So, the city, rather than improving the efficiency of their roads, make the neighborhood streets less attractive by adding stop signs and speed bumps.<p>The other factor is the profit motive.  Frustrated drivers who have limited options for side streets become increasingly likely to slip through changing lights or speed between signals.  The result is, of course, greater revenue for the city.  You'll note, this is also a completely unsafe situation.  Ideally, our municipalities are there to make things better, easier, safer.  Here, they're not -- yet, no one seems to complain.<p>What you can do, rather than introducing yet another optimization agent (humans do this pretty well), is organize a social movement to make your streets safer through applying demonstratively better solutions with existing technology.  For instance, why do demand lights initiate an immediate change rather than simply queuing the change durning the next light cycle?  Negligence and miserliness.",1278697764

It'll generally below the value that employers get from the workers (meaning that the employer profits from the arrangement).<p>Now it's a little more complicated than that because of imperfect information (the farm owners don't know how many people are going to come around looking for work or how little pay they'll take) and imperfect competition (Even if a worker hears that he could make twice as much 500 miles away, he might have to take the job where he is if he has no good way to get to that area with better jobs.), but that's how it works in theory.",1278695774

The App Store isn't a separate product.  It's a feature of the iOS system.  Remove the App Store, and the iPhone and iPad become much less appealing.  Yes, maybe directly the App Store contributes only 1% of the profit, but the App Store itself contributes to a lot more than just 1%.

Do you still think that she is considered wealthy?<p>- She has been employed as a licensed clinical social worker for 11 years with a county in california.
- She owned a condo for 3 years, sold it, made 100K profit.
- She used that 100K as a down payment on her current home.
- She bought the home for 500K, 400K 30 yr fixed mortgage.
- She bought the home 6 years ago.
- Today, she owes $370K, and the BPO of the home is 170K.  This is commensurate with other homes in the area.<p>- She has 30K in the bank and a pension plan with the state of California.<p>She is still employed with the county, but they are pursuing layoffs in social services.  Her job is at risk.  Technically, she is insolvent, as the 300K owed is greater than the 30K she has in the bank.  Her retirement pension doesn't count towards solvency.<p>So a set of circumstances where she used the profits from one investment, and placed all of those profits in another investment to buy a nicer home for herself has turned sour.  Her salary let her afford the 400K mortgage, but she wasn't able to save or invest in other items.<p>She didn't have tremendous wealth, but she did have skills and a job that would allow her to continue payments against a loan, at the cost of not being able to afford any other investments.<p>When this is all done, she'll have 40K in the bank from saved mortgage payments, a pension, her job (hopefully), and bad credit.",1278695280
1501325,comment,1500634,1500800,0,0,Be_Silly,,,"You say no-one will convery because your app is not fundamentally changing how they work.<p>How about you get really intimate with what they use, how they use it, and work on simplifying workflow UI, readability, all the human factors stuff which seems to be overlooked once a project gets rolled out because the painful bit of codifying processes too all the budget?<p>I mean, work out what you could overlay as a benefit, in a drop - in app. Ignore bling, save where used to flag data that needs working on urgently, and think about that old hullabaloo of the 70's consultant with clipboard: time and motion. Think how many times a UI context switch is required. Take away frustrations.<p>Obviously i've no idea if what yu're working on is the slightest bit suitable fr this treatment. But if i had a nickel for every time i've seen a support rep slam down their phone (i was going to say smashed, but we're all enlightened PC people now!) because of something as dumb as having to hit the fourth button on their machine to transfer a call, i'd be doing pretty good.<p>It's not fair of me to keep using phone use analogies, but i don't se enough info as to what other people ar trying to solve here, hope you get my drift anyhow.<p>Can you write  ""helper app""? Remember multifinder or i forget the name but whatever it was on early macs which allowed you to copy and paste to a stack? Id there something functionally simple like that you can offer which doesn't mess with the underlying interfaces, but which still requires some pretty neat writing and likely a fairly deep understanding of the existing apps to make work consistently and without snarling anything?<p>Whenever i get private project time, increasingly rare sadly, i keep sketching out UI models for a desk phone which would be complimentary to the tracking / contact apps i use, not be a awful ugly alterntive. Things like flipping a contact window from the list on the handset to my main monitor. The hard bit isn't so much now i have to work out a way to communicate that from phone to PC, because one way would be to loop the phone data to the PC and use the new USB screen driver tech. The hard bit is working out what you want to really happen. Is that, you finger flip a contact towards your main screen, and you get a fully expanded list of the discussions you've had with them? Can drag and drop work with this in a kind of wacom tablet way, so then hw does movement on the obviously smaller touchscreen translate to your main monitor? If, say, i've a preference for greyscale display on anything which cannot be usefully colored to convey real information, does the ""flipped"" window stay greyscale? Do i want the flipped window to be large, float or be even a normal window, or do i want it ""brought back"" / closed by a gesture on the phone screen? How could i do that from a cell phone?<p>That's pretty pie in the sky for a solo project, but whilst there remains good utility from desk bound objects (my favourite gripe is i can dial important customer numbers from memory faster than i can bring their entry up on my very latest processor Nokia) and these objects, like everything else, wear out, and are now nicely converging to voip protocols which are mature enough there's no reason to go for a proprietary type such as cisco, theres a market for these things.<p>Making any of this elegant is no small ambition. But consider this thought, that i remember new employees getting ""phone training"" because they needed to know how to handle the butt ugly interfaces of pbx attached phones which to this day are not often much better than a bunch of soft keys and if you're lucky those keys are customisable but still very basic features. Why can't i drag and drop a call with my finger whilst i'm on another call? The other thing is with the iphone we really have a lot of people finding new ways to use a telephone, and hat idiom i think will spread to the desk phone. Suddenly it may not be necessary to train someone how to put a call on hold, transfer and pick up the next incoming without muffing it with fat fingers. If i remember, AT&T research got quite far as to graphical interfaces, i think the device was called an I-O or something. It ran on an ATM network for the prototypes.<p>I can;t quite be apologetic about my phone obsession. Companies still buy an awful lot of desk phones, and getting those to work with even simple contact apps is often a total PITA, and not much benefit is derived. Make the right connector, and you've a very interesting straddle market, selling forklift hardware upgrades and the back - end to make them play nice. Ouch, i just remembered that awful word ""middleware""!<p>About the time they ran those Apple ads where some exec thought his staff were taking office computers home, but instead was told they were bringing their macs to work, i worked front line call center as a first job, where the productive people brought in their own phones and headsets, and went to extremes to patch them in to the corp pbx. That time, the phone of choice was a AT&T model with a 4 line VFD which we could read even in bright light and at an acute angle, and which you could ""alpha tag"" your incoming numbers, basic caller identity, but which the official office system supposedly didn't support, but did, and we hacked (nicely) our own caller groups so we could take decent length breaks and be covered by a buddy across the room. Make that stuf real simple, and - apart from the up tight ""Office the movie"" kind of echoes this gives off, yu have a lot of people in regular jobs wanting your kit badly.<p>Idle random thoughts, really. I think this pretty uncool bit of daily work is simply under cared for. Yet there are an awful lot of very big businesses for which the phone is their primary income point. Maybe if this ageing tech actually worked well, we'd not have outsourced call centers because center staff could actually be more productive. At least in that dimension. I've too many ""account managers"" at our telco who're authorized to do diddly squat to assist me, which is likely the reason senior mgmt don't care for which pbx / phones they use.<p>Outside of big ""old economy"" shops, however, this sort of thing could really help small dev shops get their customer relations under control. It's not organization per se - we can all be very controlled as to contact management - but take away just one bit of meatspace logic burden and i know i'd have considerably more time to write. Instead of contact management, i call it ""distraction management"".<p>I'm probably candidate for most boring post now, so i'll go curse at my phone's voicemail access system now!",1278695248

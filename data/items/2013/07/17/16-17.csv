If you buy a $19 charger from Apple, it&#x27;s going to be as safe as you get. If you buy a cheaper charger from a store like Target, it&#x27;ll be safe but probably worse power quality. More or less you get what you pay for. (No charger is 100% safe of course; Apple chargers have had recalls and occasional problems.)<p>I&#x27;m the author of the original post and I&#x27;ve torn apart and analyzed a lot of chargers if you want to see the differences between them: <a href=""http://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-apple-is.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-ap...</a>",1374080366

Numbers correspond to the order in which the OP lists them:<p>1.  Error Tracking.  I&#x27;d also recommend catching JS errors that are happening client side.  Whether they&#x27;re sent to 3rd party analytics or bug tools, or sent to your server for logging (what we do) is up to you.  A JS error can prevent your app from working just the same as a server side bug can, so definitely do this.<p>2.  Setup your support email.  Yes, but also include a very easy to access support form inside your app.  Even though I include our product&#x27;s support email address on our website and in account verification emails, 95% of support emails come from w/in our app through the built in support form.<p>3.  Get a few friends to test the app first.  We were fortunate to have friends very eager to do this, that also represented our target audience.  In addition to finding bugs, we also found they re-emphasized features we left out or thought weren&#x27;t important.  They also downplayed features we decided to include instead, either b/c they didn&#x27;t work as expected, or weren&#x27;t as important as we thought they were.  But use good judgement when acting on their feedback, depending on how much they represent your target audience.<p>5.  Uptime Monitoring.  OP, what are your uptime reports saying?  I test drove Digital Ocean for about a week, but their network was the least reliable out of all 5 hosting providers I tried.",1374078835

Perhaps a tutorial on first run, or don&#x27;t show the widgets unless there&#x27;s some data.<p>- There should definitely be a way to import books.  There may be a standard library format, if not use CSV.  Almost all libraries will already have a system that does this.  The only way you will convince them to change is if the migration process is easy.<p>- The rows in the catalog view widget seem to get big enough to fill the widget.  When you don&#x27;t have many books, it looks weird.  Probably better to set these as a fixed height.<p>- Make the entire row for a book clickable.  The whole row gets a cursor icon, but only clicking the text takes me to the next page.<p>- Deep linking doesn&#x27;t work<p>- When I add a book manually, the ID doesn&#x27;t seem to stick.  I entered &quot;22222&quot;, and now I can&#x27;t find that anywhere.<p>- CoverSwish is really cheesy.

6058550,comment,6054935,6056340,1,0,RogerL,,,"Okay, I name you Patent Examiner Potentate. Just a few simple questions.<p>Are wheels obvious?\nHow about a wheel attached to two logs (a cart)?\nHow about fire?\nwoven grass to catch fish in a stream?\nTaking some seeds from a plant and planting them?<p>Those completely transformed our lives, yet, for a very long time, were anything but obvious. My point is not to bicker about fire and how a patent process might have treated it, per se, but to illustrate how hard it is to recognize what is obvious or not. If no one else is doing something, in the tech field, is it because it wasn&#x27;t obvious, or because the tech wasn&#x27;t quite there yet? I&#x27;ve talked with quite a few (US) patent examiners and they are smart people, and find it anything but trivial to rule on obviousness. I&#x27;ll say more about that in relation to &quot;one click&quot; below.<p>The bigger issue, to my mind, is the ease of research and implementation. It doesn&#x27;t cost years of research to devise &#x27;one click&#x27;. After you have thought of it, you can hand it off to a mid-level programmer and it&#x27;ll be added to your stack in a few days - and a junior programmer could&#x27;ve had a prototype going in 15 minutes. Contrast that to the people rightly lamenting about investing years of work into medical device, only to have it stolen from them by a bigger (or just different) company.<p>I haven&#x27;t studied the history of one click, so I could be wrong about its details. If so, please focus on the broader ideas. The argument is simply that if no one else does something for several years when it was possible, then that idea is not &#x27;obvious&#x27;, except in hindsight.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m not crazy about extending 20 years of protection to such a trivial implementation. But how do we do that without punishing people with years of research, or just a brilliant flash of insight? I&#x27;m sure we can come up with a straw man patent (and perhaps one click is that straw man, though I don&#x27;t think so), but the difficulty is in ruling on non-strawman patents.",1374078305

If the mass of everything  including the official kilogramme  has been growing proportionally over time, there could be no way to find out.</i><p>The way to measure the increase in weight is actually described in the article itself: observe a shift in absorption/emission spectra.<p>Of course, such a shift may be infinitesimally small and undetectable over short timespans. However, this is precisely the sort of theory (like all the neutrino theories, for example) for which you set up a very long-term experiment.<p>The experiment is simple: measure the absorption spectrum of hydrogen in space with an extreme level of accuracy and a bajillion measurements (that&#x27;s the scientific term).

This was back when &quot;financial engineering&quot; was the buzzword... that worked out well, didn&#x27;t it?<p>I&#x27;m sure some firms will really like these degrees, but if you&#x27;re a company (like Google, for example) insisting on a specialized degree, why not aim for PhD level? The income differential is marginal. In Chicago, PhD quants for funds generally start out around $140-150k. I&#x27;d argue those ppl are going to be more productive researchers/data scientists than what can be produced by an online program, due largely to value of a research oriented degree versus a skills oriented degree like this one. Even if there is a project component, it isn&#x27;t the same as writing a thesis. I did an M.Eng way back, trust me: it just isn&#x27;t the same as banging your head against a research topic for a couple years.<p>Also, for what it is worth, I found the target audience for one-year financial engineering degrees (Goldman Sach, etc) didn&#x27;t respect the degrees as much as PhDs & MS w/thesis. They generally regarded it as a 5th year of university.<p>Criticism aside, I&#x27;m sure this is a great skill builder and ML is fun thing to learn.

I assure you most of us do prefer to take things in context. It&#x27;s OK to look up once instead of looking down all the time.<p>Purpose is ancillary to art. Art without purpose and merely <i>is</i> as art has been a cornerstone of creative expression since art has existed. The fact that you prefer to inject purpose behind it now has no bearing whatsoever on what people will consider artistic. You&#x27;re not the arbiter of worth or taste.",1374076886

The device would only need to ask for the password before the first backup that includes a wifi password, on the first backup after any wifi password change, and before a restore. Wifi password storage on the device itself can continue to use whatever mechanism it currently uses.<p>This can actually be cut down to just needing to ask before the first backup and before a restore. Generate a public/private key pair. Ask for the GA password and verify it, and use that to deterministically derive a key to encrypt the private key. Store the public and private keys in the cloud. Cloud data can then be encrypted with the public key before being sent to the cloud.<p>They only need to ask for the GA password again when they need the private key, such as for restoring the data.",1374076845

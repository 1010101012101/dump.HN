Just use something like /.'s ""interesting"" label/along with other labels instead of ""like"" so that users are motivated to categorize FB content. Then allow them to automate the posting of their own ""X"" label content. FB needs to stop being closed w/r/t the greater web. It's compelling people to talk about themselves and not to explore the Web or language.<p>FB can fix this by adding richness to its experience. It can only do that by making the tool actually motivate users to share knowledge instead of share narcissism (where I'm going, what I've done, what I said, what I'm wearing, who I'm dating, etc.).<p>Now FB is infecting my daily life because most people essentially only wish to talk in memes. They talk as if they were speaking from a statusbox. It's adage-like, but vacuous and insipid since these people aren't reading or educating themselves.<p>Facebooking is a cognitive disease, as they're admitting, except the point ""we want dopamine anyway"" is irrelevant. Don't fucking hack your users. Why admit that as if it were a justification? Bluntly -- you assholes. Stop wasting our time by constructing faux-justifications simply because the English language allows for them to look like real justifications.",1343094807

4283934,comment,4281722,4282540,3,0,lgeek,,,"> a car model only has a handful of key patterns for millions of cars<p>This reminds me of growing up in Eastern Europe. Story time: Under the Romanian communist regime, there was only one car factory (Dacia[1]) making cars for personal use. Their main model was essentially the same from the '70s until 2004. For the first 10 years or so after the '89 revolution, Dacia dominated the local car market (because their cars were cheap and really easy to fix).<p>Now that we have the oh-so-important context, your comment reminded me that when I was a kid, my parents bought a Dacia. What confused me at a time was that random people would periodically ask to borrow the key.<p>It turns out that for 30-something years, Dacia only used a few models of keys. In fact there were so few that if you locked your keys inside (doors were unlocked by key and they locked automatically) it was feasible to try keys from random cars until one worked.<p>To be fair, the engine key was different from the door key, and it didn't have this problem. But, getting back to your comment, if you're talking about a recent card model then that's just crazy.<p>Also, I would have thought that keyless entry systems use correctly implemented public key cryptography. Is that not the case?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution_of_1989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution_of_1989</a>",1343094676

While it's a truism that any model with enough free variables can ""fit"" a data set, this does not render the exercise useless.<p>Nor are models the only reason we think people are driving the global temperature change. There are still large numbers of plausible biological/chemical explanations for man-made global warming, and fewer that involve random fluctuations.<p>In the end, though, I think the best argument is simply caution. There's no backup planet if people like you are wrong, so it's best to proceed as if we're tiptoeing on the edge of a cliff. If 99% of scientists are wrong, then all we'll have wasted are funding dollars as effort.

So in such a case, the service that responds to the URL provided would need to support granting permission to a 3rd party (in the case of the 3rd party copying the data and hosting it), or potentially granting permission to everyone (if the 3rd party is only going to host the URL, not a copy of the data).<p>As well, you'd need to deal with abuse issues. If the 3rd party is going to host a copy, you need to make sure it can't be used as a DOS attack against the URL's original host, for example.<p>The web is chaotic by nature. That is its strength, but it's also a weakness when it comes to data longevity. Without some kind of standard for guaranteeing data persistence that reaches critical mass (such as over 80% of content hosters implementing it), this will be a very tough nut to crack.<p>Another problem I see is legal. DMCA takedowns are so easy to do that a dead URL is only a lawyer letter away, even if their claim is completely invalid.

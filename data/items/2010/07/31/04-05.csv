See his 'apologetic' email to Shaw - he could have meant what he said, but it read as if he was still pissed off at Shaw.<p>I'm thinking this shouldn't be on HN.

1563249,comment,1562982,1563189,0,0,jackowayed,,,"I think you're onto something with the region idea. All the major carriers offer nationwide plans because people expect to be able to travel pretty much anywhere and still have their phones work. That means that we all foot the bill for putting towers all over our insanely-large country because one day we may run out of gas in the middle of Nebraska and need to make a call.<p>The European nations, Japan, etc. are all much smaller and more densely populated, so the cost of covering the countries with towers is lower per person.<p>If you're really just going to use your phone in Queens, NY (and other fairly populated areas), you can go with a discount carrier like Boost Mobile, but you'll curse your frugality when you do actually stray from cities because their coverage map looks like this: <a href=""http://www.boostmobile.com/coverage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boostmobile.com/coverage/</a> instead of this: <a href=""http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/CoverageLocatorController?requesttype=NEWREQUEST"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/CoverageLocatorController...</a><p>Also, as I said in another comment, that graphic makes the difference in cost look way bigger than it is.",1280552266

It looks like most plans are still in the $20-$30 range, it's just that a lot of them are unlimited and counting as 30GB, or have an official cap so high that the carriers sell it knowing that on average <10% of the cap will be used.<p>For example, Drei in Austria is $1.31/GB.

Um, so the vision of the future from Wall*E is something to aspire to?  No reason to ever leave your bedroom again, for anything?  Not even vacation?  That's the value proposition?<p>Except, all the people there are in their bedrooms controlling their robots, so your robot is just interacting with the other robots there.  Except, the people living there are probably controlling a robot near where you live, anyway, so your robot is probably just hanging out with other robot tourists.<p>For remote work arrangements, the thing that is lacking is the massive amount of information conveyed through body language.  100% of the body language of the person controlling the robot is still not conveyed.

For larger projects, this may well not be the case, and there may be someone setting the parameters for the overall system and then a number of designers responsible for implementing the general rules in specific areas.<p>> Obviously you're the customer, but you're not getting much bang for your buck if you insist that the primary design be done by an amateur.<p>You imply a false dichotomy. I can't speak for others, but on several projects I currently work on we might outsource things like graphic design, artwork and typography to a specialist, but want to retain direct control of the overall layout and interactive elements. In one case that comes immediately to mind, that is because we have extensive knowledge of usability issues from a previous version of the software that no designer joining the project fresh would have. In another case, we have web-based access and various apps for mobile devices, and we want a consistent overall look and feel across all versions of the service, so while the designer is free to fit the branding to the natural style on each platform, they don't get to move everything around in a way that could confuse our users. These decisions are not made by amateurs, they are made by specialists whose job is to analyse hard data and make these decisions. I wouldn't ask these people to decide what kind of antialiasing to use on the web buttons, and I wouldn't ask a graphic designer without the relevant knowledge of our products to lay out the user interface.",1280549880

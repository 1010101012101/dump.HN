9411116,comment,9408881,9410515,0,0,diamondman,,,"Very well written.<p>I had no idea some companies went so far as directly making their debugger the software key. That is intense but makes a lot of sense.<p>In the case of the Xilinx Platform Cable I wrote firmware to, they have a CPLD that does the JTAG writing of data, and a Cypress FX2LP handling the USB information. They use a quad buffered USB endpoint to let the PC load as much crap as possible into USB and in my experience the buffer fills up fast and the jtag work takes the time. Of course this is only because multiple &#x27;pages&#x27; were preloaded, otherwise the delay to request more pages would be insane.<p>Are you talking about the flash driver for loading external SPI flash? If so you likely know this but you have to load the FPGA with a program to load the flash with the program you want the FPGA to load on reboot. Each of these programs have to be compiled and tested per chip. \nWhile looking through OpenOCD I found they had drivers for the actual flash, and I am not sure if this is required for the fpga flash boot strapper I just described.<p>I will look over these links. I recently started messing with ARM chips and they are programmed very differently than FPGAs so I have some stuff to learn on that.",1429567160

I personally think the war on drugs is very stupid, but the data indicates that it does not disproportionately affect blacks. Blacks use drugs at much higher rates than whites and blacks distribute drugs at even higher rates than whites. The prosecutions for narcotics crimes are by all indications commensurate with rates of criminal offense.<p>It may be dumb law, but it&#x27;s not racist. Cops and prosecutors are simply doing their jobs. If you think there&#x27;s a racist conspiracy I dare you to prove it.",1429567152

9411081,comment,9409934,9410566,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Modes of communication are just that, different modes. No less intrinsically superior or inferior to one another, merely different. Literature is just words but it has great potency in communication. It can transform one&#x27;s mind, it can lead to new vistas of understanding, perception, reason, and thought. It can serve as a bridge of understanding between individuals, cultures, eras, religions. It can evoke the full gamut of emotion and feeling, it can reveal the numinous, the extraordinary, the sublime, and the awe-inspiring. Many religions put their roots in literary works precisely because of the incredible potency such works can have. But the written word is hardly unique, many other forms of art can be just as potent and rich, such as music, painting, sculpture, motion pictures, and even teevee. Even blogs, twitter, instagram, youtube, or vine.<p>When we look at new sources of communication we often judge them based on their average use case, but this ignores the fact that the majority of nearly any form of communication is dominated by the routine and banal. When we judge literature we judge it based on its greatest successes and ignore the mountain of mediocrity underneath the pinnacle, we would be wise to do the same elsewhere. It&#x27;s easy to denigrate little glowing rectangles, but it&#x27;s easy to denigrate scribbles on sheets of pressed wood pulp too.

They will not CLOSE, but as they get closer we can learn from each other.<p>With that said, to address your point: Linux is one of the most dominant systems for servers. Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc use it for almost all of their backend systems. They use it not just because it is free but because it is proven and scalable. Open source databases and web servers also enjoy considerable (sometimes dominant) share.\nThere are companies that provide support contracts for Linux (Suse, Redhat) and that model has worked to fund other open software.<p>So I think that establishes that a company will use open software.<p>As for being scary, you are correct that is a primary decision making motivation. It is why many professionals in tons of industries still run windows XP. Often they NEED XP because the software they rely on is so dependent on that specific ecosystem that huge rewrites are necessary in order for it to work on anything else, and this work (even if done by the original distributor) will take years for the tools to be stable again. This is not good engineering on the part of the tool designers. The crippling fear of NEVER TOUCHING ANYTHING is something that the open software alternatives seem to be alleviating in corporate environments since the late 90s.<p>The lifecycles of putting a phone together is much faster than Intel designing a processor, or Xilinx designing a new FPGA. building boards in phones and laptops is a complex game of Lego and placing them around so the timing diagrams work in all expected use cases. And if the timing does not work in some cases, whatever, people get a phone a year. Hell on my Galaxy S3 Verizon said &#x27;oh yeah that is a known issue where sometimes the GPS just does not work because of loose wires, that was fixed in the S4, I think, which is only $$$.&#x27;<p>You are also correct about direct support from the company. In face make Xilinx enough money and they will share their secrets with you. But I am more targeting small to medium development. If open tools become popular and stable enough to get market share in hobbyist up to medium sized companies, it will only be so many years before bigger companies hire new engineers who grew up using open tools and have no patience for tools that have to be emulated in windows XP and have 35 nested sub menus for enabling a feature.<p>I do not feel attacked at all.

You yourself admit that it’s just a perspective, another way to say that it’s an opinion.<p>So by prefacing your perspective with a disclaimer that you know in advance that you are going to present an unpleasant perspective, what you’re saying is that you are going to be unpleasant, you know you are going to be unpleasant, and you know that this isn’t an uncomfortable but incontrovertible truth like the Bible not being literally true.<p>So what it comes down to is this: Instead of just giving an unpleasant perspective, you have given an unpleasant perspective AND told everyone that you know it’s unpleasant, know that it isn’t and incontrovertible truth, and are telling everyone any ways.<p>This drags yourself into the discussion. Instead of just thinking about your perspective, we are also asked to think about the fact that the perspective is unpleasant, why it is unpleasant, why you choose to share an unpleasant perspective, why you announce it to us, and so forth.<p>People might, for example, think that you say such things purely because you enjoy being controversial. Is that true? I don’t know! But when you tell me that you are bing controversial on top of actually being controversial, it’s certainly a reasonable thing to wonder.<p>Which is why I go back to what I suggested to you: If your perspective is worth sharing, just share it. Leave out the preparation. Don’t derail your point by inviting speculation as to why you’re sharing an unpleasant perspective if you know in advance its unpleasant.<p>I hope you understand that I’m trying to help you share your ideas--whether I agree with them or not--in the best possible and most constructive manner.",1429564543

Blacks have always decided what kind of culture they want to have and they will continue to do so.<p>This is so clearly untrue that I wonder if it&#x27;s worth pointing out the obvious. In fact, black-skinned Americans rarely have had the option of self-determination, and mostly that is due to white-skinned contemporaries who enslaved them, forced them into ghettos, segregated them in public life, and denied them political rights, and social and economic opportunity.<p>More concretely, in the southeastern United States, blacks were slaves (something local whites fought a war to try to preserve; take a step back and think how bizarre that is) and after that oppressed: They couldn&#x27;t eat in the same restaurants, go to the same schools work the same jobs, live in the same neighborhoods, sleep at the same hotels; talking to a white-skinned women could result in a black-skinned male being lynched. Even today, there is much discrimination; consider whether they can join certain college fraternities in Oklahoma, for example, or walk the streets without being harassed or worse.<p>To suggest social segregation is due to the choices of black-skinned Americans is absurd.",1429563996

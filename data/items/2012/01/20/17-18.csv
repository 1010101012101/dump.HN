Those employees probably took a pretty significant pay cut to work at this startup.<p>Let's say a programmer who could make $120,000 a year joins the startup at a $70,000 salary. The next year it gets bumped up to $85,000, and then the year after $95,000.<p>After three years that programmer has now forgone $110,000 in income. If the company sells the programmer has to earn at least that much back (and we're ignoring lost opportunities from not having the money). So the company has to sell for $5.5 million dollars.<p>And of course, the programmer may have worked <i>way</i> more hours than she would have at that $120,000 hour job. Let's assume she average 50 hours a week. In any sane world she would earn 25% more for that amount of work. So if we value her time based on her possible $120k salary, the sale needs to deliver $200,000 to her to be worthwhile.<p>Now we're looking at a $10 million dollar sale.<p>Oh, and that's assuming that the company doesn't have investors with preferred shares who will take a 3x return. So maybe the sale really needs to be $15 million just to get that $200,000 back. And of course many sales are not all in cash, so maybe she just gets stock in some other company, and that stock may not even be liquid.<p>All of this assumes that there is an exit as opposed to a bankruptcy.<p>She's gambling on an amazing exit (not necessarily Google, but something like VMWare buying Zimbra for $100 million. That happens, but it's pretty damn rare.<p>All of this is compounded by the fact that for the founders, a smallish ($5-20 million exit) is entirely worthwhile. They walk away with a few million dollars each.<p>Early startup employees get completely and utterly screwed. I'd never consider being one of these employees again unless I was offered a lot more than 2%. I think a fairer number might %10.

The instrument is one of a kind, on a spacecraft, so we are limited to figuring this out from whatever telemetry is available and there is no option of replacement with a different unit. Now I'm a software guy with no prior training or experience in hardware, and certainly not with this kind of thing. This problem had been given to other people but nothing came of it, so he gave it to me. Knowing nothing, I learned whatever seemed like it could have a bearing on the problem. I thought about it. A lot. I asked questions. A lot. The problem was sporadic, so I tried to find correlations. For two solid weeks I had <i>nothing</i> to show for my time but I kept at it, and then I found a 100% correlation, leading to the instrument people finding the problem and correcting their firmware. I'm not one of those prodigy polymath people. I grasped nothing about this instantly. The only reasons I succeeded were that I kept an open mind, kept thinking and learning, asked for and used any help I could get, and determined to see this through until I had an answer.<p>I'm sure the process of getting money out of VCs is exactly the same, except all the details are different.",1327081407

Start job hunting now.  Don't sign it unless you have a good reason (e.g. guaranteed compensation at then-current pay level, plus normal raises as determined in some fashion, for the full non-compete term -- and paid COBRA or equivalent benefits that perhaps extend beyond the non-compete term (because you still need coverage until you actually land the next job); health care insurance can be as important as anything else -- also not forgetting the value of pension plan participation and/or 401k match, and the like).<p>No, you may not get all of that.  But those are all factors to consider in making a personal decision.<p>From your superficial description and my own personal experience, it reads as if this organization may be turning into crap.  I'd suggest seriously exploring moving on.<p>P.S.  Also know the geographic limitations, if any are specified, of the non-compete agreement.  In some jurisdictions and/or employment domains, absence of geographic limits effectively makes the non-compete illegal or unenforceable or a judge may modify the agreement to impose such a limitation -- probably the maximum geographic limitation allowed under local law.

By your logic, if Toyota's price was suddenly 0.5 * price, then stealing just got two times better! What's wrong is wrong.<p>Second, your equation does not do justice to math. If your definition of X is the same as mine (i.e. average likelihood an individual will buy this item, independent of the world population) then you're saying Toyota's lost income can potentially be GREATER than the price of the car.<p>In clearer terms, if<p><pre><code>  dX / d(world population) = 0\n</code></pre>\nthen<p><pre><code>  lost income = X * world population * price\n</code></pre>\ndoes not have an upper bound! With the explosive nature of the world population, it would seem that theft gets exponentially worse as the years go by.<p>Where does the logic break down? Well it seems you've modeled the world's purchases of A SINGLE CAR as independent of each other. (In other words, you've modeled the lost income if Toyota had a car stolen by every human in the world.) What you really want, for n people, is<p><pre><code>  X*P + (1-X)*X*P + (1-X)^2*X*P + ... + (1-X)^(n-1)*X*P  = P*[1-(1-X)^n]\n</code></pre>\n- and there's our upper bound at P.<p>So now the comparison is between (1 - (1-X)^N) and X. In the case of software like Windows 7 where relatively few people will go for a free alternative, X is pretty damn high. I won't argue that it's greater than (1 - (1-X)^N), but it's nowhere near your estimate of 7 billion.<p>In all seriousness, I definitely agree that the ""relative virtue"" of digital theft is better than other forms.

In the late 90's it was difficult to avoid using a Microsoft OS. First, the commercial operating systems available were mostly niche products with relatively little software available. What was available was not compatible with what most of the world was using.<p>Linux was gaining popularity, but it was difficult to install and use. It lacked the quality desktop apps that are available today. It lacked a coherent and usable desktop. I think it was around 1998 or '99 that I installed RedHat 5.2. It came with fvmw2 or something. It was hideous, and that was only after I spent hours trying to configure X in the first place. There was no free MS Office-compatible word processor. StarOffice came out around then, but it was commercial and pretty lousy. It was years later that there was decent office software that was compatible with the rest of the world. Netscape 4 was pretty much the only game in town for web browsing. Fonts looked like total crap. Oh, and that's if you could even get your modem to work in the first place. Winmodems were everywhere. I went out and bought an external 56k modem for like $75 and spent weeks getting it to work. I could go on, but I really don't like thinking about the bad old days.<p>Basically, you were stuck with Microsoft back then. They may have only lost %5 market share or some small number, but there are very good alternatives available. Market share hardly matters at this point for end users. Whether you choose MS, Mac or Linux you can expect wide support.<p>It's a very different landscape for end users, as well as Microsoft.",1327078943

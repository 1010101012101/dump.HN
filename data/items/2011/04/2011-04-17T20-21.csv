There just aren't enough people who have been there/done that before that are investing in the next generation.

2456997,comment,2456379,2456682,12,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"I've been a false negative several times, I'm sure.  Here are some of the reasons why.<p>1. Poorly defined questions.  One time, the interviewer kept referring to the browser as ""the server"" (in the context of a web app), despite my questioning him about it several times.  After 5 or 10 minutes of trying to figure out what he even wanted, I told him I didn't want the job and ended it.  From his perspective, he'd successfully weeded out an incompetent.  From my perspective, I avoided working for someone with terrible communication skills.<p>2. Unclear objectives.  One interviewer asked me to extend a small language by adding string support.  No problem.<p>""OK, I'd start by modifying the parser.""<p>""That's not what I had in mind.""<p>""But that's clearly the first step.  This isn't even a real language.  What's the point here?""<p>""To get a feel for how you approach a problem in the real world.""<p>""Well in the real world I'd modify the parser.""<p>""Well just don't.""<p>3. Pointless questions.  ""List some design patterns.""  Seriously?  Sometimes my mind blanks on such questions.  There's GoF over there on my bookshelf, and I could talk about the nuances of when and when not to use (almost) any particular pattern if they'd mention one, but from their perspective I know no design patterns at all.  From my perspective, I'm glad I didn't end up working at a place whose screening process selects for rote memorization.<p>4. Insulting questions.  ""Write a for loop.""  I mean, I just told you I've been coding for 17 years.  You're basically calling me a liar.  I don't respond well to that.  Enough of these and I might turn you down and walk out.  A professional relationship (like any relationship) requires a certain amount of trust, so an interviewer this jaded/distrustful casts doubt on my ability to be accepted  and productive there.<p>5. Trick questions.  I hate them and I might have to count down from 10 if you ask me how many square manholes are in Beijing or whatever.  You'll probably think I'm googling the answer.<p>6. The ""figure out on the fly what I learned by reading a paper"" question.  Frequently I'll respond with a working but sub-optimal solution, then they'll prod me with hints until I come up with (or more often don't) the <i>exact</i> algorithm they had in mind.  Sometimes they can't even explain what I need to improve about my answer, they just tell me to try something else.  Sometimes this is the first question of the interview, and if I don't figure out the clever trick it becomes the only question, because they let me spend an hour banging my head against it without moving on.  From their perspective, I answered zero questions and might not know anything at all.  From my perspective... well I have no perspective by the end because I'm so tired and angry from being put through such a process.",1303073848

2456993,comment,2456379,2456858,6,0,geebee,,,"Fair enough.  I think this is an important thing for developers to understand about themselves before taking a job.  Do I want to work with a large existing code base?  Do I want to work for an organization where I need to build political capital to gain autonomy?<p>For some people, the answer will always be ""no"".  For others, it's complicated, and potentially impossible to answer without trying out the company for a while.<p>Suppose the code is well organized and understandable.  The bugs are not the product of bad design, they're just the inevitable side effect of any real software project.  The programmers who created these bugs are largely still with the organization, they are highly competent, and are more than willing to help a new dev get up to speed - and the documentation (and code quality) is so good that it usually isn't necessary.  Lastly, the team and management is eager to give autonomy and flexibility to a talented, proven dev, so it's not a problem to build up that ""political capital"" you mentioned.  Well in this case, what you said is reasonable and more than acceptable to many good devs, even if it isn't right for everyone.<p>Then there's the nightmare scenario - the team is not highly competent, and the reason you were hired is that the good programmers keep quitting and there's nobody to help you. The code base is a mess, and documentation doesn't exist or is useless.  Even getting a build to work is difficult and painful.  The reason the management is giving you bug fixes is that they don't really know what to do with a new hire, so they assign some bug fixes, that'll keep you busy for a while.  Lastly, they're aren't interested in listening to new suggestions, so political capital won't get you anywhere.  O course, in this case, I suppose it doesn't really matter what your assignments are.<p>By the way, there is another way to get political capital. In my first real programming job, I had an almost ludicrous amount of autonomy.  Like, ""find something that might be useful and write software for it"" levels of autonomy.  This was the dot com boom, and there was enough money to hire people for this kind of thing.  Of course, they didn't give me high impact assignments, but they did give me broad flexibility in meeting (and even determining) my assignments.  This can be an alternate way to build up the political capital you mentioned.  Instead of having a limited role on a high impact project, you have a broad role on a low impact project.  That can work well for some people - however, these jobs are very rare.  Usually, you have to trade the stability of a paycheck for that kind of freedom, especially early in your career.",1303073738

By making the import feature so mediocre, the browser vendor would pretty much ensure that the user would not switch browsers without paying a high price for it.</i><p>This simply does not hold up.  The high price for a shoddy import feature is paid by the vendor of the browser the user is switching to.  There might be a valid point if the discussion were about a shoddy <i>export</i> feature.<p><i>And yet, bookmark sync is yet more silo behavior: you can sync your bookmarks from Opera to Opera, but not from Opera to Firefox.</i><p>But the converse doesn't hold true.

Sometimes a non-tech cofounder can bring good expertise in something you're not very good at.<p>I'm not a developer, but I am doing a high-tech startup. My cofounder is extremely good at the overall backend work of our product. He's also very good at talking (sometimes I can't get him to stop) and understanding the overall UX the product should have. How have I helped? Well, for starters we established what he's good at and figured out where the gap is. He hates frontend work, so I have designed the site and learned some HTML/CSS to expedite the frontend development. We're also both taking on 500 hats a minute. There are things he's good at (the technical speak) and things I'm good at (the non-technical speak) and things we're both good at (client meetings, processing feedback, making sure the product is working quickly). We're working on a security problem.

2456952,comment,2455793,2456215,3,0,cmurphycode,,,"""checkout and reset do completely different things when given files or when not given files.
reset on files should really have been called unadd. reset on refspecs should really have been jumpto, moveto or something else indicative that the current branch ptr is moved to a new refspec. --soft and friends could have been --no-update-index or --no-update-files.""<p>I can understand your confusion, given the seemingly separate use cases for reset, but in fact, it makes perfect sense. Reset always does what it says it does. Let's break it down:<p>git reset --mixed <commit> will make your current HEAD point to <commit>, reset the index to <commit>, and leave your working tree alone. This is useful for ""uncommitting"" the last commit, e.g. so you can split it up into smaller commits. Example:<p><pre><code>  git commit -am ""lots of changes""
  # realize you should really do better
  git reset --mixed HEAD~1
  git add myfile.py
  git commit -m ""implemented feature x""
  git add yourfile.py
  git commit -m ""bugfix #3182""
</code></pre>
Handy. Now let's look at the ""unadd' scenario:<p><pre><code>  git add dontstage.py
  git reset HEAD dontstage.py == git reset --mixed HEAD dontstage.py, since --mixed is the implicit default
</code></pre>
git doesn't touch your commits, since you are already on HEAD. Git does reset the index to HEAD, which is before you added dontstage.py. If you had other changes that you added, it won't reset those, since you provided the limiter of dontstage.py. Git does not touch your working tree, so dontstage.py stays modified. The end result?

2456951,comment,2456535,2456684,1,0,nkohari,,,"I think your idea of throwing away a prototype is a great one. We essentially did that when we launched our startup, although it was just a major refactoring rather than a complete ditch-and-rebuild effort.<p>Beyond that, oh man...<p><i>Even if the non technical cofounders sit on their asses and do absolutely nothing while you code all day, you'd be sitting on 33% equity in an already successful startup, when they took all the cash risk up front to prove the thing works.</i><p>It's this mindset that makes a lot of would-be technical co-founders see non-technical people as a threat. I don't care if you're a technical or non-technical co-founder, if you're not going to pull your weight somehow, I don't want to be in business with you.<p>Also, to be honest, the ""cash risk"" is essentially irrelevant to me because I have the skill set to build and validate the MVP myself. There's also a large enough market for my skills that I could sell consulting services (yes, at north of $100/hour) to cover any financial costs to test an MVP.<p>All you're really bringing to the table is the first 3 steps, and asking your technical co-founder(s) to handle the next 617 or so. It's better than just a ""big idea"", but not by as much as you're thinking.<p><i>All you've got to do now is code and build on existing success. And you think that's an offer that you should scoff at?</i><p>Oh, is that all?<p>Here's a hypothetical scenario: let's say Toyota builds a concept car and takes it to an auto show to demonstrate it to customers. They get fantastic feedback and decide to take the car to market. So, you'd be willing to take the concept car design and find a way to manufacture it in an efficient and cost-effective manner? I mean once the customer validation is done, all that ""engineering"" stuff must be simple, right?<p>Metaphor aside, an MVP is vastly different than a truly sustainable product. If it's a true MVP, there will be a myriad of unsolved problems (scalability, maintainability, etc.) that only a skilled engineer can solve. Not to mention, what happens when the market inevitably shifts, rendering some or all of your customer validation effort useless?<p>The most important aspect of any startup is the dynamic of the team. The most important part of that (in my opinion) is to have clearly delineated roles, roughly equivalent in workload and importance. The best teams have members with complementary and supplementary skills, and everyone respects the skills and contributions of everyone else.<p>My attitude puzzles you because you're assuming that 90% of the risk comes before the MVP. Launch is very different than break-even, which is very different than sustainability or a liquidity event.<p>I'm a huge believer in the lean startup (I launched and sold one myself) but you have to recognize that the initial customer validation is just the first step down a very long and arduous road. It's hard enough to walk that road in the first place, let alone if I have to carry you on my back.",1303072664

And not just patches but patches with dependencies. This set of patches describes how the current state of the repository is constructed. So when you merge you're really just adding new patches to the repo and it knows exactly what to do to make it work.<p>The interesting thing is that git <i>has</i> all the information there... It <i>could</i> go through the relevant history, diff everything and put the resulting patches in a darcs-like data structure and then commute patches with darcs' patch theory.<p>But in the end I'm not sure I'm ready to call darcs' style <i>right</i> and git's <i>wrong</i>.

Close your laptop, open it, how long did the LCD take to come on?<p>• When the children stop watching, why does it sit there burning 300 watts all night long displaying a blank screen.

I'll work on that when they get the difference between a computer and a monitor.)<p>• Why am I seeing a movie letter boxed in both dimensions for an image that is smaller on my 42"" LCD than it was on the 26"" Trinitron I replaced? (Why are none of the zoom modes right to keep the aspect ratio and make it fit without losing chunks? Isn't there a computer in there with a digital frame buffer that should notice these things and take care of them?)<p>• In my letter boxed movie, why are the subtitles drawn on top of the action instead of the black areas?<p>• Why is my TV unable to remember the volume I use on the U-verse, the Apple TV, broadcast, and the video game?

I want ""on/off"", ""volume"", ""input select"", (and channels for when I watch broadcast).

It's her private diary which she's using to plan works of fiction.

One could conceivably interpret her sentence to mean that, but I think the only reason anyone <i>has</i> is because Michael Prescott ellipted the quotation in his article. It is vastly more likey that Rand was still speaking generally, and it reads that way more naturally.<p>Thirdly, she does indeed have many (other) negative things to say about the mob in this specific instance, but they are reasonable criticisms. For instance the enthusiasm of the newstand boys crying 'they're going to hang him!' It's when mass-approval crosses the line into unhealthy mass-<i>relishment</i> of a situation. And people coming out of the woodwork to associate themselves with the moral highground.<p>Basically she saw this case, saw the public reaction, and detected something in that reaction which wasn't motivated merely by the crime itself, but the criminal's open defiance of the social order. It inspired her to write a story about someone who also cared nothing for the social order, who wanted his own success above all alse, but was not a phoney or a hypocrit in any way, <i>or a danger to others</i>, and committed a crime for which he was widely hated: not because of the crime itself, but because he refused to acknowledge its wrongfulness.

Particularly when it's a really tricky bug I've been bashing my head against for days.<p>Then again, when I've been after a given bug for days it can get really frustrating, and I don't enjoy the frustration.<p>And it's not like my dream job is doing nothing but fixing bugs.  I also enjoy architecting new systems, learning new concepts, and applying them during the quest to complete a project.<p>I suppose a healthy mix of tasks, from architecture, to writing new code, to fixing bugs is ideal.<p>But what I really hate is writing documentation.  I know it's necessary.  And my (non-throwaway) code has quite a lot of comments in it because I know it's necessary and good practice.  But it can get quite tedious.<p>I'd much rather bugfix than write documentation.",1303071230

I believe you should take some time for yourself, doing the thing you like other than working, and thinking about/doing that. Being relaxed and not thinking about problems is the best way for me to get a good night of sleep and be refreshed for the next day. Ofc, there are points where thinking about work before sleep is necessary and/or unavoidable.<p>Thinking about work all the time, especially before going to sleep, makes me feel like I am living to work, instead of working to live.

When merging B2 into C1+B1, you'd effectively un-merge C1+B1, merge B1 and B2, and then merge C1 and B1+B2.<p>But how would that work if C1+B1 had a conflict that had to be manually resolved? Assuming merging B1+B2 into C1 has the same problem (a fair assumption) will I have to do the same manual fixes again?<p>Or are they smart enough to look at the failed automatic C1+B1 merge, and generate a patch to that from the manual fixes I did, and then try to use those to resolve the merge of C1 and B1+B2?<p>I suspect there will be cases where this is just not going to work well.",1303071114

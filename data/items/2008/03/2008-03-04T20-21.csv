The expense of moving is only worthwhile if you intend to take a very long time  to build your product. Most web applications should only take a few months, right?<p>If you do go to India, consider Goa. I am told it is very beautiful, very European, and the Goans speak English.",1204664286

129106,comment,128816,128856,0,0,Electro,,,"Probably not, but I'm used to living way more north than Montana and actually more northern than London where the time change is based on for the UK. I have to say it is needed no matter the economic effect, when for over 2 months you see no sunlight what so ever during a working day it has an abysmal effect on worker efficiency.<p>I have only observations to base this on, but workers start dropping off well before 'flu season'. I do a lot of work outside and I find the comments about DST harming farming to be irrelevant; the main one is that harvesting labour becomes in efficient as crops have to be harvested after the dew. If I didn't need workers at 6am I'd tell them to come in at 7 or 8am when the crops are ready to be harvested. That's just common sense; if I'm working outside, I'm not going until it's safe for me to do it and if its too dark I'll tell the customer I'm coming later, if they don't like it lump it.<p>Although, on my more hackerish note: 2 million candela torch + power inverter = sun rise at 3am. I believe it's supposed to produce sunlight-like brightness over some 450m^2, although it isn't always useful and without it being hooked up to some form of power it's out of batteries within 15 minutes.",1204663480

... where the hours method of the Today class would check the date and return the right number of hours would fix that right up.<p>Of course, it may not really be that simple, but tons of operating systems and other software handles DST just fine nowdays.

129087,comment,128873,129029,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Higher profits and cash accumulation are an understood macro-economic symptom of credit expansion.  Consumers buy stuff with money earned from business production (mostly wages), so consumption is constrained by the amount of production going on.  Cut back on wages and production on a macro level and then demand sinks and businesses make less money.  But introduce heavy spending on credit and consumption is no longer constrained by aggregate production outlays.  People spend money they didn't earn.  Businesses can cut back on wages and still find themselves making large paper profits.<p>The problem with this picture is you're looking at a transfer of wealth, by way of inflation, from currency holders to those positioned to leverage credit on the best terms.",1204661826

That doesn't mean we don't care about differentiation-- it just means that we have an army of excited users with GREAT ideas and that's what we need to focus on...  Almost exclusively, for the time being.<p>I think you're spot on with your compare/contrast.  RT is a ""knowledge"" tool with a bit of behavior modification/feedback thrown in.  8aW is a ""behavior modification"" tool with a bit of knowledge thrown in.  We're both making people more productive-- we're just taking different paths.<p>I would add that one of big differences I see is that RescueTime focuses on online and offline activity.  We're even playing around with the idea of data from phones and calendars. 8aWeek focuses on the browser, and honestly does a much better job at shaping browsing habits (and always will).<p>""A rising tide raises all ships""-- I think competition raises awareness and that's a good thing.<p>FWIW, I've never heard anyone say, ""I'm leaving 8aWeek for RescueTime"" or vice versa.  I think they scratch fundamentally different itches.",1204660828

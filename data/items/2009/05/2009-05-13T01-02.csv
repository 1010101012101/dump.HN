606371,comment,601967,603166,0,0,boucher,,,"No, setting a variable to undefined doesn't delete the object contained in that variable (and I never said it did). Neither does calling delete. Delete gets rid of the variable itself, not the object it contains, which is precisely what I did say.<p>JavaScript is a garbage collected language. As such, you, the developer, have no control over when an object can be ejected from memory. When a reference to your object no longer exists, it can be considered for collection. Until then, it can't.<p>In your example, the number object (123) is eligible for collection in both cases. The difference has nothing to do with 123, but instead relates to the test object.<p>In the first case, test will still have a foo property, which won't point to anything. In the second case, the property itself will be removed from the test object.<p>It's (most likely) true that leaving the foo property intact means using more memory than if you delete it, but the memory used is less than actual object, and whether or not this qualifies as a leak is debatable. Which leaves my original statement:<p><pre><code>    delete's only purpose is to remove a property name from an object
</code></pre>
This is particularly relevant when you iterate over the keys in an object for some reason. In the case of a global variable, this is just an implicit removal from the global/window object.",1242178668

The ""piercing the veil"" doctrine disregards the LLC and allows someone to go after the owner if the LLC is not sufficiently separated from your personal assets and control.

First, much of the content of on the web amounts to echoing, filtering, and distorting high-quality source data.  If you can tap that source data, are the gains you realize from what's been derived from it worth the extra cost of going out and doing the work to acquire it and then separate out the noise?<p>Second, there is a lot of real or perceived value in knowing where your data is coming from.  Tons of companies pay tons of money to get data and statistics from sources that they can trust.  Until Google's willing to vouch for these results beyond ""we tried"", the bespoke curatorial approach is going to keep capturing these dollars.",1242178604

They'll help you far more than any HN advice will.<p>Going against that suggestion, my next suggestion is don't register in California, as you'll pay the $900 LLC tax each year just to exist.  The $900 varies based on how much the corporation earns each year, but that's the minimum.<p>That said, you don't have to live in the state where you incorporate, but it does make things easier, as you have to have some place with a physical, non-P.O.Box-like address to send corporate documentation to.  If you are not located in the state of incorporation, you'll need to have a registered agent.  This agent will receive your corporation documents and forward to them for you.  Most agents charge about $200 for the service -/+.<p>Since you move frequently, having a registered agent will probably work just fine for you, as your corporate mailing address wouldn't change unless you change agents.<p>You file taxes in the corporation's state, then apply the profits to your own taxes, as a pass-through.  Note that, if you set up the corporation with pass-through taxes, you'll pay taxes on the corporation's profits, even if you don't pay yourself the money (as in, if you end up with $20k in a savings account at the end of the year, you'll pay taxes on that $20k, even if you aren't paid the $20k).<p>Hire an accountant, too.  And a bookkeeper who can show you the books at any point (say, using a site like <a href=""http://netbooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netbooks.com/</a> ).<p>I've used <a href=""http://mycorporation.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mycorporation.com/</a> a couples times in the past for incorporations, one S corp, one LLC.

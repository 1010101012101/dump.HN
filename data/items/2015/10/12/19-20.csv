One concern that was brought up I mentioned in the article--it could be a big distraction to uproot the entire team and move to California for three months, when we already had some traction and a team in New York.<p>The team&#x27;s complete support and unanimous decision to do YC made us more confident that rather than be a distraction, living in a house together in California would immensely improve our productivity and motivation. To commit ourselves to that, we decided as a team that we would work 13 out of 14 days during YC--we only took one day off every two weeks. In the end, we worked really hard but had a LOT of fun, and we accomplished so much more in those three months because we were living and working together.

No one would argue that this is not a massive risk. It&#x27;s risky, and there are lots of regulations that make it safer.<p>But just because it&#x27;s risky doesn&#x27;t mean it should be illegal, which is what OP seems to be implying. It&#x27;s a risk, but ferry pilots do a lot of smart things to mitigate that risk.<p>Aviation in general is a risk, which is why we have massive tomes of rules [0] that make it safe. And even if you follow every rule to the letter, bad things can still sometimes happen that are completely out of your control. Weather could go south in a hurry, or you could have a mechanical issue and lose an engine. How you deal with those issues will decide whether you live or die.<p>It&#x27;s risky, but it&#x27;s not illegal. With a properly trained pilot and a properly maintained airplane, those risks can be controlled. Part of being a good pilot is about minimizing risk wherever you can and being ready for anything that can possibly happen in the sky.<p>FWIW, I would not even dream of doing a flight that long over water, and I have massive amounts of respect for those who do. Hell, I never fly further from shore than I could glide if I lost my engine. The thought of being alone in a Cessna over the North Atlantic without being able to see the shore scares the hell out of me.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/FAR-AIM-2015-Regulations-Aeronautical/dp/1619541475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/FAR-AIM-2015-Regulations-Aeronautical/...</a>",1444679752

The first example I can think of off the top of my head is in MVAs. Modern cars are designed to absorb a lot of the momentum from collisions and minimize injury to passengers, but that isn&#x27;t always enough to save lives.<p>You&#x27;re not a solid body. You are basically a big blob of salt water that happens to contain some hard bones and ligaments mixed in with vulnerable organs. Even if you can protect the blob, those organs can still move around inside it.<p>Let&#x27;s say you slam into another car head-on. The frame of your car absorbs a good bit of the energy, but your body still &quot;wants&quot; to keep going forward. Then your seat belt stops your thorax, but your heart and major vessels keep going and slam into your ribs, sternum, etc. Best case scenario, you&#x27;ll walk away with a minor myocardial contusion and possibly develop a dysrhythmia, but if you&#x27;re not so lucky, your descending aorta may actually be ripped by your ligamentum arteriosum and you&#x27;ll mostly likely bleed out.<p>Your head isn&#x27;t as restrained as your thorax in a car, but even if it were your brain can still move around and slam into your skull (which can lead to traumatic brain injuries like concussion, diffuse axonal injury, cerebral laceration, etc.).",1444679570

If it&#x27;s 1:1 and the problem is bound by memory latency, the pre-runner is going to go no faster than the working thread.   If it&#x27;s N:1, why not simplify the architecture by doing the computation in the pre-runner?<p>I think the only case it would make sense is with a heterogenous architecture where you have unlimited small cores available, but in this case there may be better solutions.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with spreading this work across multiple cores, but in most cases every core will have underutilized memory operation ports.  What we need are compilers (and languages) that are smart enough to make effective use of these.<p>I think this is much better solved by small batch processing and more effective use of software prefetch.   Instead of having each core handling one &quot;request&quot; at a time, batch them so that it&#x27;s handling about 5 at a time (which happens to be half the per core limit of outstanding memory accesses).   As a batch, issue all the lookups (with prefetch or directly to registers), then as a batch process the now in-cache results of the previous requests.  Magic --- by keeping the request queue full, you&#x27;ve increased your throughput 5x[+] at the cost of a small additional static latency while you build your batches!<p>[+] This would be theoretical for a memory-latency-bound pointer-chasing scenario.

I have link (below) with both a long video and a brief summary in numbered points. I think the arguments against using it <i>today</i> are solid and conclusive if you&#x27;re not forced to for some pragmatic reason.<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/UAQaWuWG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/UAQaWuWG</a><p>Nonetheless, C got a lot of use via network effects. There actually <i>have</i> been many C dialects out there: compiler variants, extensions for specific systems, safe/secure versions of it, parallel/concurrent versions, hardware languages... the list goes on. Probably dozens of C variants appeared and mostly failed. The main reason is legacy: whatever replacement exists must support the existing C language usage and codebase. Any fixes that break apps or require rewrites are rejected. Marketing and community effects are another issue.<p>Now, we have to ask what is LISP. I think Graham said it best in that it&#x27;s an axiomatization of computation itself:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html</a><p>So, LISP is that concept and core. Its nature lets you express various constructs however you want to. You break the problem into smaller pieces while simultaneously modifying the language to better express their solution. What&#x27;s best way of expressing a problem naturally varies from programmer to programmer. The LISP variants therefore are the many ways different people (or communities) looked at solving a problem within the LISP core and philsophy. Some stay purely in it, some diverge wildly from it, and some are in the middle. The fundamental concept and approach, though, with many interpretations on expressing it are why there are so many LISP&#x27;s, though.<p>Clojure, a new expression of the LISP concept/core, has advantages expressed well in the first paragraphs of the rationale:<p><a href=""http://clojure.org/rationale?responseToken=894e644e3f4488b17953fe43bbd586c0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/rationale?responseToken=894e644e3f4488b17...</a><p>This philosophy and use of DSL&#x27;s for expression is no longer unique to LISP. One can see it in REBOL/Red quite directly with some takeup in languages such as Haskell and Julia. Forth also does this sort of thing with stack operations. So, we&#x27;re seeing uptake of the idea even in mainstream with them recognizing the benefits. All started with McCarthy&#x27;s reducing all computation down to some primitive, consistent elements that were shown to express or adapt to anything.",1444679265

Do you classify the two failed Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (of four) as an engineering failure, or a scientific one, or both?<p>For that matter, what is on your list of ambitious scientific projects, and how many of them have a success which is not primarily due to being a well-run engineering project? That is, the success of the Large Hadron Collider surely is due mostly to being a successful engineering project.<p>My experience is that the high-end science projects like what you are talking about (eg, the so-called &#x27;Grand Challenge&#x27; projects), are constructed so they <i>cannot fail</i>. They lack a solid, measurable goal, and any advancement is counted as a success. This failsafe means they are more likely to get political backing.",1444679237

HIV for example is &quot;worst case scenario&quot; but with combination therapies we&#x27;ve managed to make HIV a treatable disease.<p>At the end of the day it all boils down to one hard fact. An organism can&#x27;t evolve if it is extinct. Selection works by causing deaths in a population (ex selecting those which live on). If you raise the &quot;cost of selection&quot; so high that an organism can&#x27;t pay the cost in deaths, the population goes extinct.<p>As a rule of thumb, to fix an adaptive change, it takes 20 times the population in deaths. So if the current population is 1000, it&#x27;ll take 20,000 deaths (and by deaths I mean removing an unfit allele from the population) over many generations to fix that adaptive allele.<p>>Of course I don&#x27;t even know what &quot;combined therapies&quot; is, so I&#x27;m probably wrong. What am I missing?<p>Therapies or methods that employ more than one independent mode-of-action. Ex: Two drugs given at the same time.<p>This forces the organism to adapt to two things at once, doubling the cost of selection. As you increase modes of action, the cost rises to the point that it is impossible to adapt before the population goes extinct.",1444679130

10376497,comment,10375283,10375877,0,0,Steuard,,,"Partly it&#x27;s a matter of culture. Generations of physics students grow up seeing Feynman presented as an ideal, and in so very many ways (not just scientific!) he&#x27;s a great person to emulate. But if his &quot;rakishness&quot; is lumped into that package as part of your vision of &quot;an ideal physicist&quot;, that actively does harm: it encourages male students to treat the women around them like meat[0], and it gives female students a yet another signal that &quot;physicist&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; are incompatible. This culture is pretty clearly one reason that physics lags behind almost all of the other sciences (including pure math) in approaching gender parity.<p>And partly it really does feel like Feynman literally thought less of most of the women in his life. (On some level, that&#x27;s par for the course: Feynman was an asshole to just about everyone.) Just for instance, the conclusion of that &quot;You just ask them?&quot; story (from memory, again) includes the observation that female college students are &quot;no better than&quot; women who hang around in bars, whom he had already called &quot;whores&quot; (and seemed to mean it). See also [0], again.<p>Some of this is a reflection of the era when he lived. But it&#x27;s a particularly vivid reflection, and it was a pretty thoroughly sexist era. When Feynman is held up as an ideal without keeping that context in mind, it can tend to propagate the shortcomings of that era into the present.<p>It does indeed take two to tango. But nothing about that guarantees that both dancers are <i>equals</i>. When I tango, just for instance, tradition insists that as a man, I get to lead, and my partner&#x27;s job is to do what I tell her to as gracefully as possible. It&#x27;s stretching the metaphor to apply that directly here, I know (though it <i>is</i> unquestionably a manifestation of our society&#x27;s invisible background sexism). But I suspect that most of Feynman&#x27;s many lovers did not think less of him in the ways that he very explicitly learned and practiced thinking less of them.<p>[0] Just for instance, in one of his stories, Feynman was clearly delighted by the description of a local woman in Brazil as &quot;a sleeping dictionary&quot;, since he didn&#x27;t speak Portuguese well.",1444677926

The interesting thing is that a large number of other providers in the Linux space has started to agree with their design decisions—effectively unifying on the &quot;systemd platform&quot; rather than on the &quot;Posix platform&quot; they were focusing on previously.<p>I think this has been coming for a long time; the large OS providers already think of Desktop Environments as the GUI equivalent to a &quot;platform&quot; rather than as application software for the OS; thus why Ubuntu, for example, has a separate distribution for each GUI software suite.<p>In a discussion of systemd history held here previously, it was pointed out that back in 2007-or-so, there was a large amount of interest expressed by various distro makers in adopting OSX&#x27;s launchd as the basis for a new platform standard, if only it had been FOSS at the time. Early systemd was a launchd clone; upstart also started as a launchd clone before mutating.<p>I have a feeling that although RedHat was the one to step up and <i>create</i> a platform, <i>all</i> of the major distro providers were actually waiting to hop on the first available FOSS &quot;OS platform&quot;, no matter who it came from. If, for example, Apple had created &quot;Apple Linux&quot;: a version of Linux that runs the OSX GUI and OSX apps—then I can bet you right now that every other distro would have standardized on whatever &quot;platform&quot; gunk was in-between that GUI and the Linux kernel; CoreFoundation et al would have become to Linux distros as WebKit is to mobile web browsers.<p>As it stands, it&#x27;s only an accident of history that this didn&#x27;t happen with the <i>Android</i> platform. (If the Android Runtime ran native-speed binaries from the start, and the GUI was developed five-or-so years later such that it was developed from the start with Win8-like unified desktop/mobile support in mind rather than getting type-cast as &quot;only for mobile devices&quot;, I could bet that Linux would &quot;be&quot; Android now.)<p>---<p>With all that said, while all the <i>big, commercially-backed</i> Linux providers have been waiting on tenterhooks for a &quot;platform&quot; to latch onto, all the little distros are looking to remain Unix-y, and that&#x27;s a wonderful thing.<p>Think about it: when you&#x27;ve got the POSIX platform &quot;for desktops and servers&quot; and the Android platform &quot;for mobile&quot;, and nary the twain shall meet, it makes little sense to care about cross-compatibility; why would you want to run Android apps natively on your desktop? But if you add in a third platform that&#x27;s <i>also</i> for desktop—the systemd platform—suddenly kernel developers and distro makers and whatever you call the FreeDesktop people start thinking about how to create a Linux-based OS that natively supports <i>multiple</i> platforms, so that it can run code targeting systemd, <i>and</i> code targeting Plain-old-POSIX, without making a mess. And once you have that infrastructure in place... why not let it run code targeting Android too? Why not first-class Wine support? Etc.<p>One thing Windows has had forever (though lately in a degraded state) is multi-runtime (or, given the above discourse, multi-&quot;platform&quot;) support. Windows can be Win32 to one program, OS/2 to another, and POSIX to a third. OSX had the capability for multi-runtime support back when it was called Rhapsody (the &quot;Red Box, Blue Box, Yellow Box&quot; architecture) and also co-supported Cocoa and Carbon apps for about a decade. And these are just single companies trying to meet small needs. Linux, the OS with a kernel that supports every device a nerd ever cared to packet-probe, could easily become &quot;the multi-runtime OS&quot;, if we care enough to make it that way.<p>If we don&#x27;t, though, at least systemd is decent. :P",1444677869

Teaching to me involves a give and take of some kind, some form of productive conversation or line of questioning rather than just inserting data into brains in a linear fashion.<p>I did find the unapologetically mechanistic perspective here interesting though, since I just got done teaching St. Augustine (&quot;City of God&quot;) to a class of very bright students at an Ivy League university. They hated it and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why at first. To me its a treasure trove of fun minutiae about weird Roman deities, a deep meditation on why empires rise and fall, and an example of one of the greatest rhetoricians in history at the height of his powers. To them it was boring - even more boring than Aristotle&#x27;s Nichomachean Ethics which I personally find dry as dust.<p>The reason, it became apparent, was that St. Augustine was doing something similar to what this blog post outlines - following a didactic line of argument intended to dissuade potential disagreements rather than provoke them. (I personally don&#x27;t see Augustine that way, but they did - in the words of a student, &quot;it felt like a lecture and not a conversation.&quot;) Or, perhaps, they thought Augustine was selling his ideology rather than teaching it?",1444677483

10376449,comment,10375085,10375085,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"While I think this sheet is a great reference, the level of opinionatedness is a turn off. It strikes me not open to people that might bring a point of view that challenges the author&#x27;s orthodoxy. Some of the opinions expressed seem to indicate a lack of understanding of successful patterns from outside of the mainstream JS world. I would not use as a filter in hiring.<p>For example, I might agree that composition is better than inheritance if I&#x27;d never experienced the joy of algebraic data types. Pattern matching doesn&#x27;t work out so hot without some concept of &quot;is-a&quot;. Languages that support type-classes also tend to avoid the brittle-class problem. I agree that Java style single-inheritance hierarchies are a recipe for disaster, but that&#x27;s not the only type of class-based inheritance. Scala, for example, has a much better story.<p>While Javascript&#x27;s prototype system is really powerful, I&#x27;m not at all convinced anything more than a small number of library writers should be interacting directly with it. CoffeeScript and ES6 have class stories that are vastly more productive in most cases, in my opinion -- and by the way, are pretty thin layers of prototypes, if someone needs to really hack on that level. In my experience, most people spin monstrosities when they try to hack together their own prototypal logic, when all they is something pretty basic. The author&#x27;s stamps [1] are very cool. They&#x27;re more powerful than `class`. But they still expose a level of variation and control people don&#x27;t generally need in reality. To analogize with functional programming -- sure you can solve almost every problem with `reduce`, but that doesn&#x27;t make it better than `map` in all cases. There&#x27;s huge value to using a tool with just the power you need for the task at hand.<p>In general, I&#x27;m suspicious of anything that tries to establish some kind of knowledge quota for new hires. How much time would it take to acquire this knowledge? If the answer is &quot;not that long, just read all the links on this page&quot; then why not evaluate your candidates on skills and knowledge that aren&#x27;t so easily acquired, and then assign the reading those links you want understood as orientation homework? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I want people on my team capable of thinking at the level of depth some of these questions explore. I just think it&#x27;s more productive to find ways to let the applicant expose that depth through descriptions of their past experience, not by adhering to my preconceived list. I wrote a piece [2] when I worked for HuffPost that explored ideas for evaluating potential hires, with out being overly prescriptive regarding their specific knowledge at the time of interview.<p>[1] <a href=""https://medium.com/javascript-scene/introducing-the-stamp-specification-77f8911c2fee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/javascript-scene/introducing-the-stamp-sp...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alanjohnson/were-hiring-engineers-all-wrong_b_7973484.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alanjohnson/were-hiring-engine...</a>",1444677302

It went on. I was rather amazed. I didn&#x27;t realize the female mind was capable of understanding analytic geometry.<p>She went on and said, &quot;Suppose you have another line coming in from the other side, and you want to figure out where they are going to intersect. Suppose on one line you go over two to the right for every one you go up, and the other line goes over three to the right for every one that it goes up, and they start twenty steps apart,&quot; etc.--I was flabbergasted. She figured out where the intersection was. It turned out that one girl was explaining to the other how to knit argyle socks. I, therefore, did learn a lesson: The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. Those people who have for years been insisting (in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary) that the male and female are equally capable of rational thought may have something. The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it.</i><p>That&#x27;s almost 60 years ago that he went on record saying that pedagogical issues may be affecting women in mathematics and he had lost faith in the assumption of their inferiority.  This wasn&#x27;t just anybody saying this and this wasn&#x27;t just any physicist saying this - this was <i>Feynman</i>.  This was the guy the other physicists looked at in awe and it was the year after he won his Nobel Prize for Quantum Electrodynamics.  Few physicists have ever earned so much respect from their peers.<p>If that&#x27;s not convicing then read how he was the one who encouraged his sister Joan to pursue science against the wishes of their mother who thought women lacked the cranial capacity to do science.

Richard presented her with a book called\nAstronomy. “It was a college textbook. I’d start reading it, get stuck, and then start over again.\nThis went on for months, but I kept at it. When I reached page 407, I came across a graph that\nchanged my life.” My mother shuts her eyes and recites from memory: “‘Relative strengths of the\nMg+ absorption line at 4,481 angstroms . . . from Stellar Atmospheres by Cecilia Payne.’ Cecilia\nPayne! It was scientific proof that a woman was capable of writing a book that, in turn, was quoted\nin a text. The secret was out, you see.”</i><p>Richard was 23 or 24 when he gave her that book.  Keep in mind this was the 1940&#x27;s and it was the same year he received his PhD - so he wasn&#x27;t just a kid and supporting women in science wasn&#x27;t the popularity contest it is today.  When 24 years later he made the other quote in 1966 he knew women were capable scientists because his sister had already become one.<p>This is all to say that before you take one chapter from one book out of context and extrapolate across his entire life make sure you get a few more data points to see if the extrapolation makes any sense.",1444677287

10376410,comment,10375796,10376007,0,0,zeveb,,,"> Because Lisp doesn&#x27;t have a flat memory model, you can&#x27;t directly produce a binary array suitable for direct copying to output device memory (ex. network card, GPU, etc) by simply expanding expressions using the built in syntax.<p>What are you talking about?  Common Lisp has built-in support for vectors:<p><pre><code>    (let ((vector (make-array length :element-type &#x27;unsigned-byte)))\n      ;; do stuff with that flat array of bytes\n      ;; …\n      (replace ext:gpu vector))\n</code></pre>\n(In this example, EXT:GPU is a chunk of memory which is overwritten by VECTOR; one might conceivably use COPY-SEQ instead of MAKE-ARRAY, and one might of course just operate on EXT:GPU)<p>> Doing so is also contrary to the ideals of functional programming<p>Lisp isn&#x27;t about functional programming; Lisp is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative, functional and OO programming out of the box (and can of course be extended to support aspect-oriented programming, table-oriented programming or what-have-you).",1444676799

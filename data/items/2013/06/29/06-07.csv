And on the 7/8th day I had what I would call a strange dream. I was practicing Vipassana on the bed as I could not get to sleep. Suddenly I&#x27;ve fallen asleep and dreamt of being someone else on a distant past. After some time I woke up not knowing where I was and what was happening.<p>For anyone &#x27;spiritual&#x27; enough that would be a &#x27;past life experience&#x27;. But the thing is. I don&#x27;t know why, but while there, every dream seems a lot more &quot;real&quot;.<p>I think it has something to do with all the silence involved. You can&#x27;t speak, and the center itself is very quiet (far from any urban center).<p>On the 11th day (when you are allowed to talk with other students) I&#x27;ve found out that it was very common indeed.<p>So I think, yes, with enough practice every one will have similar experiences.

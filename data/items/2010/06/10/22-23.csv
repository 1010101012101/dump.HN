The British seemed to have some pretty useful statisticians during WWII.\nSee this also : <a href=""http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm</a><p>EDIT : So there's about a fifty fifty chance that the second observation will be bigger than the first.\nAfter the second observation the range of possible future observations will be divided into 3 zones, 1 below the lowest of the previous 2 observations 1 above the higher and 1 between the two previous observations, so there is now only a 1/3 possibility of the next observation being above the higher of the 2 previous observations. Next time that drops to 1/4 then 1/5, so that's how the standard deviation decreases proportional to 1/n",1276210698

Most display drivers today can use the color sub-pixels to carry spatial as well as color information, so that would bump the performance of this display comfortably over the detection threshold of the human eye.<p>Second, the throw-away comment that ""magazines are printed at 300 dots per inch"" is incorrect and mis-leading.  Dots are not the same as pixels, a printed dot is either ""on"" or ""off"".  A magazine printed at 300 dpi has a substantially lower actual resolution than a 300 pixel-per-inch display that can render 18-24 bits of color at each pixel.<p>Finally, as others have mentioned, the slamming of Sharp's Quattron technology is wrong-headed.

1421920,comment,1421398,1421752,0,0,dkarl,,,"I think his main point vis-a-vis C and C++ is that the kernel has a unified C culture and adding C++ would import a bunch of different C++ cultures.  As a C++ developer in a C++ shop, I can appreciate this.  Our shop has a very solid and consistent C++ culture.  We can read each others' code because we all use the same language features and coding style.  You can't do coherent C++ development without having this unity.  The only way to develop a unified C++ culture for the Linux kernel would be for it to be grown slowly over time, starting from a small group of developers, the same way the kernel was.  That can't and won't happen.  If C++ is allowed into the kernel, a bunch of extremely skilled C++ programmers from different C++ cultures will start to contribute kernel patches written in C++, and it will be a tower of Babel.<p>However, I don't buy his argument that C++ is unsuitable because it's linguistically a high-context language.  Part of this problem of context is solved by having disciplined, humble coders who know the limits of human intelligence.  (I do not think these are new requirements that would exclude existing kernel contributors.  C has, and the kernel uses, <i>macros</i>.)  Part of the problem is solved by having a unified culture.  The rest of the problem of ""context"" in C++ is really what would be called ""state"" in C, and of course you can't read state in the text of a C program.  If you could magically create a unified and disciplined culture of C++ usage in the kernel, it would be fine.  But that can't happen, so C++ is out of the question.",1276207638

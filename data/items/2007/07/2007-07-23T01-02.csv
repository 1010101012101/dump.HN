36002,comment,35787,35919,0,0,euccastro,,,"The question is a strange one. If you need to have fought tooth and nail to get emotional investment, how do you get the emotional investment to fight tooth and nail in first place? Or put another way: by that line of reasoning, won't you have the required emotional investment after the first couple ""highs and lows""?<p>It's true that we're prone to attach emotionally to stuff that we've suffered to get, and you may use that to your advantage. Most of the time, though, you'll have to fight <i>against</i> that instinct. Otherwise, you'll be unable to see bad early ideas for what they are, and you'll resist rolling them back even when it's the rational thing to do. All because you have invested too much of your time, effort, and ego in them.<p>Did the author's motivation on Open Source Food come from having fought tooth and nail to start it up? He took a week to build OSF. One week is nothing to fight tooth and nail over. His motivation comes from building something he'd want to use. <p>Now, he never got told what to build in first place, so he could have made Open Source Food instead of 8apps and Pikki, and have the emotional investment <i>and</i> the money.<p>I don't think his initial setup was a good one, but the reason is not that their beginnings were too easy.",1185153389

5.  The original is photoshop text (scalable), but saved as jpg because the gif with transparency had terrible aliasing.<p>8. Hmm, this one I don't know how to respond to as you object to using meaning for the fonts.  Facebook and Google, do they have cohesion between the meaning?
9. One color fonts are used a lot in logos. (Our prior version had 2 colors)
11. Cheap is definitely bad.
12. Hmm
13. The kerning is easy to fix
14. We are fixing that
15. ok
16. I had no idea about the focus-brand logo.  The Ottawa font is my favorite font - I use it for all of my firm's correspondence.  I found it in 1995 actually - it is beautiful and very easy to read.  The font used for the Focus brand logo is quite different - definitely not as elegant as Ottawa.

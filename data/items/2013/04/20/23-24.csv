5583288,comment,5581733,5583069,7,0,alecjw,,,"Agreed. Electronics hackery, especially making sense of someone else's circuit, takes a lot of acquired knowledge. Knowing common circuit topologies and being able to identify them when you see them, knowing that if you see a component in a TO220 package there's a 95% chance its either a transistor or a linear reg (usually you can guess more specifically just from its location on the board), having a mental list of components you can use to design a certain circuit (hmm, an audio preamp? I wonder if an NE5532 would be suitable?), knowing that a yellow bipedal surface mount thing is almost certainly a tantalum cap, knowing that a number of connectors near a SoC is probably JTAG etc. All of this just comes from experience and recognising patterns! Although I imagine dealing with code is somewhat similar? Perhaps there are certain things which you come to notice by instinct? Eg maybe you can look at some assembly and, just skimming over it know that it's supposed to be a time delay?",1366502344

At which point it can provide a simple, non-intrusive hint.<p>And going further up the wishful thinking tree, into more difficult territory, Excel should be able to grasp what you're attempting to do by understanding, say, the top 10,000 (arbitrary number) tasks commonly performed by people using spreadsheets. That 'understanding' could then tip Excel toward deciding whether there's a problem, and whether it should leave you a nice little illuminated icon at the top right of the program with an exclamation mark.<p>Microsoft should have insane amounts of data on everything people do with spreadsheets, and they should be able to make it radically more intelligent (without being obnoxious or intrusive - it should be optional and highly passive).",1366502268

If you imagine a world where you have all the data at your finger tips: let's say you obtained every camera's footage, every phone's phonecalls,etc for a mile radius for a month before,during and after some disaster. Shouldn't be too hard to imagine.<p>The problem is: what are you looking for? How do each of the moments that you detect link to each other? What patterns are indicative of someone who is plotting something?<p>Those are very difficult questions, and that's what makes the problem difficult. Tackling a problem like that requires knowledge of voice recognition, NLP (Natural Language Processing), ML (Machine Learning -- If you don't want to put in every possible scenario yourself), and much much more. The rate of data creation (and thus data processing) would also be very high.<p>How to do this well is the difficult part.<p>If you still don't believe me: boil it down to just one source. Phones. Lets say you had a wiretap on every home in which a hitman was hired to (and succeeded in)killing a neighbor. It might be a good thing to run a simple text search on the word ""kill"", or ""hit"", and you'll catch the low hanging fruit (by this, I mean the people who are bad at hiring hitmen/commit crime), but it becomes more complex when you get more serious about catching people who aren't stupid enough to say exactly what they want to do, then you have to find patterns, assuming they are there.",1366501563

As a result, people think that Excel is a great solution to a myriad of problems. You and me know it is not. But try explaining that to a multi million business that grew to that size whilst using Excel. Sure, they need something better, yet will almost never understand why.

If they register an agent with the copyright office, and follow a procedure for disabling and re-enabling access to materials they distribute based on certain notices, they then cannot be sued for having hosted that specific material in the past.<p>The DMCA does not require that anyone register an agent and follow those procedures, it only offers a benefit if you choose to do so.",1366500063

In fact, he likened what they do to creating mine-fields.  To make it really, really dangerous for other companies to even try to compete with you.  And to make sure that no challengers will get uppity with you.<p>In any case, what stuck with me was what he said about his next startup; in his next startup he would spend most of the money on patent lawyers.

Speaking as a musician, ten years ago we were all about Myspace. These days we're on SoundCloud, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. We don't use Myspace because nobody else does either. We use YouTube, FB, and Twitter because everybody else does, and we use SoundCloud to share new music with hardcore fans and with each other.<p>If you're looking to share your music with as many people as possible, you put it on YouTube, not SoundCloud. If you want people to go to a show, you talk about it on Facebook or Twitter, not SoundCloud. If you want to get a label to sign your new track, or you want your hardcore fans to be able to hear your newest music right away, that's when you go to SoundCloud. If you're on SoundCloud, you're either a musician, a hardcore fan, or, more often than not, both.<p>What I'm basically saying here is that a social network for musicians gets something very fundamental backwards, because of the four social networks musicians use, SoundCloud is the least important, the least promoted, and also the only one which was actually built for us.<p>I'm not trying to denigrate SoundCloud, it is in fact awesome and incredibly useful, but it's so much more important for a musician to be where the fans are. Also, if your goal is to occupy a smaller niche like SoundCloud does, you're still more likely to succeed building tools which make it easier for a musician to graduate their fans from the ""hitting Like on YouTube"" level to the ""downloading everything on SoundCloud"" level.<p>I think this is kind of like, ""I want to make a social network, what's a topic, musicians, ok go."" Rock on, it's good to stay focused and keep shipping, but it's better to make stuff people want, and believe me, what musicians want is to be able to make music as much and as often as possible, and that means making money from music, and that means either fans or students.",1328568494

A concept would be more like imagining an attribute or a description.<p>For example, look at this line from Alice in Wonderland:\n""The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way"".<p>This could be considered as 4 ideas, or 'thought-units':<p>The rabbit-hole<p>went straight on<p>like a tunnel<p>for some way.<p>You would look at the phrase, ""The rabbit-hole"" and imagine a rabbit-hole.  And this doesn't have to be a very exact or detailed picture, but just the act of picturing it forces you to use the visual part of your mind rather than the verbal part.  This makes what you read more meaningful and therefore improves your comprehension. It's only by improving comprehension that you can ever read faster.  I mean, if you aren't comprehending something, you aren't really reading it, are you?  You're just sounding out words.<p>The next phrase, ""went straight on"" is an action, but also more of a concept. You would imagine the concept of something going straight.<p>This idea of concepts is a bit harder to explain. It's just thinking about what something really 'is'.\nOne exercise which helps understand 'conceptualizing' is to try to look at things, and understand what they are, but without naming them. This can be surprisingly tricky to do because we are so used to naming things. But try to look around you, and think about what things 'are' without thinking of their names. What's left in your mind when you don't say words, is the 'concept'. It's getting this 'idea' or message across which is the goal and purpose of language. The sounds or text are just the messengers.<p>Anyway, likewise with the next two phrases. ""like a tunnel"" can be imagined as a tunnel or the concept of 'tunnelness'.  And ""for some way"" is another concept. You imagine the concept of something being of a considerable distance.<p>The idea of reading in word-groups has been around since 1879, when it was discovered that this is how fast readers read. Instructors began teaching exercises for students to try to increase their 'eye span', but really what was needed was to 'understand' more words at a time, not just 'see' more words.<p>The key to understanding groups of words at a time, is to take 'meaningful' groups, which form whole ideas. And the key to reading groups of words, is to visualize the ideas. This is because you can't really 'say' multiple words at the same time, but you can 'see' one whole idea at a time.<p>If you think this sounds hard to do or strange, then think of how we read compound words as single ideas all the time. We think of cupcake as one idea, not as 'cup' and 'cake'.<p>That's all this is, reading a group of words as the one idea they represent together. Fast readers have always done this. In fact they often describe how they read as ""reading in pictures"".<p>Sorry for such a long answer, but I hope it's been helpful.",1328568154

It is ideas like this that give people very unrealistic expectations. In my experience there are 2 main types of people who are hurt by the ""30 day app"" idea and others like it.<p>The first is the Instant Millionaire type. They think they just thought of the next Facebook now all they need is someone who knows how to use a text editor to build it! So they get it done by an outsourced company in India or they hire their nephew who ""is good at computers"" or they hire the local ""web developer"" in town that just finished reading ""HTML for Dummies"" and charges $100 for a website that looks like it was converted to HTML from a Word document. Inevitably the idea turns out to be crap, it fails, and it ends up being someone else's fault somehow.<p>Then there are the legit hackers who are super passionate, have a great idea, and have the skills to execute. They see all the stories of the quick hack app that seems to be blowing up online and they feel like the only way to compete is to keep up with the guys who are doing this stuff. But the reality is that if you really want to make a business out of your idea there's a lot more to it than just building version 1 and sending the link to your friends. It's sad because these people fail and get down on themselves never realizing that they had unrealistic expectations to begin with.<p>These stories of the 30 day app and others like it are the exception. They're so rare that when they do happen it gets massive amounts of attention. But those stories are the exceptions with the rule being that even well planned businesses default to failure. I site around HN and read stories of all these incredibly talented people doing stuff that's incredible and it makes me feel like I suck unless I keep up. It promotes the idea that success is quick and dirty. I hope everyone remembers that all the trends and fads in business are either bullshit or you really need to adapt them to fit your situation and have realistic expectations from the beginning.",1328567726

When we were about halfway, an Middle eastern man passed us; when he was out of ears reach, the French guy said, while nodding to the man, 'we should bomb all those f<i>ckers, they don't deserve to live'. People who say this kind of crap to total strangers have no qualms posting it online either; these people were not online before in the numbers they are now.<p>How would they know that if you are logged in with Facebook or Gmail that your name/profile link automatically appears next to the post?

You cannot prove it, nor does your reference even address the issue.  It is a claim wholly unsupported, and if you will think about it objectively, you'll find you cannot prove it without getting all investor to give up their entire trading history, and then evaluating them over the course of that history.  Nobody has access to that information so they publish spurious nonsense in order to talk people into investing in their funds.<p>Your statements about the fees charged by mutual funds is inaccurate.  %2 is appropriate, and in some cases it is %2.50 or %2.75.

If you're not a liberal, at least this shows the motivation for people spreading the idea that stocks are complicated and that teaching people about investment is dangerous.)<p>But, at the end of the day, having so many people completely giving up on investing simply means there's less competition for the outstanding deals out there, and the market is even more inefficient, which leaves me with more opportunities to profit.<p>So, for that, I thank you.<p>I've learned that, you cannot talk to people about investing-- for many of them it is like a religion.

On the one hand I do think there are many concerning aspects to shutting down a city for law enforcement purposes, even if much of that happens more or less voluntarily. On the other hand this was a rather unusual situation where the suspects were at large, well armed, known to be in a specific area, and their names and faces were known. I can't think of many other equally comparable situations.<p>What I do know for certain though is that there's far too much emotion in this discussion right now. This is an important topic that deserves thoughtful, relaxed discussion, but I don't think that's happening or even possible at the moment.",1366480676

Crimes and disasters may play out very differently from expectations, and may therefore require careful after-the-fact analysis of every available shred of information, before they're actually understood.<p>On the other hand, certain events can be fully and clearly understood right as they happen.

5582196,comment,5581422,5581743,3,0,drostie,,,"Saying ""NP-complete problems remain so in the quantum world"" is a bit imprecise because NP-complete is simply defined as a set of problems which can be solved by classical nondeterministic computers. Of course it ""remains so"" in the quantum world; it's a mathematical definition, it remains so in any world.<p>What's very interesting is that Scott Aaronson proved that normal quantum computers could have solved NP problems (in fact, something stronger: BQP = PP) if quantum mechanics allowed nonunitary linear operations or was based on the norm<p><pre><code>    norm = lambda vec: sum(abs(component) ** p for component in vec)
</code></pre>
for p > 2 (quantum mechanics is based on p = 2, classical probability is based on p = 1). So if it were any larger, the quantum computer could do brute force with ease.<p>Right now it's not known whether BQP contains NP-complete or not; it might very well contain both problems in NP and problems not in NP while deftly evading NP-complete.<p>It is known that PostBQP = PP and therefore contains NP-complete. PostBQP is the set of quantum algorithms which are allowed to destroy the universe when they fail, under the anthropic principle reasoning that ""humans will only live on in universes where the computation succeeds.""",1366480034

So I don't believe it's tautological.<p>I do agree with your statement that intelligence is difficult to describe.  And for the record I never claimed the rational agent approach will achieve ""true machine intelligence"".  Frankly, I don't even know what ""true"" machine intelligence is or would be.  What I am very interested in however is how to create an AI that is capable of fooling a person into thinking it's intelligent, in other words an AI that can pass the Turing test.  For that purpose I find the concept of a rational agent to be very helpful, in that it provides a solid foundation to work from.<p>I'm also not worried about Godel's theorem at all.  The statements that are undecidable are very obscure and basically never come into play in human decision making.  I think Godel's result has very little practical application, if it has any at all; I certainly don't think it's relevant for AI.

Belmont, Waltham, Newton, Cambridge, Watertown and the Allston/Brighton neighborhoods of Boston -- which was the original cities/neighborhoods suggested to stay at home -- is 375,000 people.  When you add the rest of Boston in (8AM Friday), you're at about 900,000 - 950,000 people.  5 million would be nearly the entire state population.<p>Moreover, I still went grocery shopping on Friday -- I live in one of the most northeastern parts of the city (Charlestown), which was about 5 miles away from the active dragnet.  There were people about.  Some businesses were open, as was the case in East Boston and many other neighborhoods.<p>The real work closures were on account of orders by property management companies.  Private security firms, from what I heard from several folks, are who refused entry into their buildings in the Financial District to any one, probably on account of limiting their potential liability.  Even then, most folks I knew had received reverse-calls from their employer even before MBTA service was suspended (which wasn't until 5:30AM).<p><i>>""Four victims brutally killed"" goes by other names in other cities.  In Detroit, for example, they call it ""Tuesday"".</i><p>I'm not sure about fatalities, but Boston called it Tuesday as well.  There were 6 shooting across Boston on the evening of Tuesday the 16th (which is a very abnormal amount for the city).  Most are thought to be gang-related.  No one thought anything of it.  Even when I listened to the police scanner starting around 10:45PM on Thursday evening, I simply assumed that it was a rash of gang-related or usual criminal activity (especially being a convenience store robbery).<p>However, gangs don't usually tote around the equivalent of giant fragmentation grenades.  There are plenty of guns in Boston, but folks using explosives aren't like gun owners (legal possession or not) -- they're psychopaths.  By the time Tamerlan was recovered, law enforcement was aware the guy was wearing an explosive vest and they had already used a fair number of IEDs that evening.  I doubt it was a call that commissioner Davis and governor Patrick wanted to make, but there was probably a very legitimate concern that more mass casualty events were a possibility.  It was clearly a very defensive action -- after all, after 7 hours they still had a suspect who had managed to evade hundreds of police.<p>Another factor for the decision may have been that both attacks were on curiously popular dates for attacks: The bombings were on Patriots Day (on which Columbine, and Virginia Tech shootings also occurred), and the 19th is also the anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombings and the Waco, Texas Standoff.

A SQL database solves that problem by doing the concurrency control for you (possibly with locks, possibly not). That's what allows a developer to quickly and easily make a reasonably complex application that scales to many concurrent queries.<p>(Sure, it sounds easy to add in a couple locks, or use STM. But then you need to make all of that work efficiently and also enforce unique constraints or something, and it starts to get a little more complex. Pretty soon you'll want secondary indexes, and a buffer pool, and checkpoints, etc.)<p>Postgres even added in an efficient version of True Serializability[1], which eliminates SQL race conditions.<p>So, can this all be extended to help with parallel execution of a single query? Yes. Some systems have had parallel query for a while, and cluster systems are also a different form of parallelism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/transaction-iso.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/transaction-iso.ht...</a>",1366478507

5582085,comment,5552504,5561858,1,0,rbranson,,,"First, let me concede that Cassandra has had a storied history of terrible read performance. However, if the last time anyone looked at Cassandra for read performance was 0.8 or used size-tiered compaction, I'd encourage them to take another look.<p>The p95 latency issues were largely caused by GC pressure from having a large amount of relatively static data on-heap. In 1.2, the two largest of these: bloom filters and compression data were moved off-heap. It's my experience that with 1.2, most of the p95 latency is now caused by network and/or disk latency, as it should be.<p>I'm not going to compare it with other data stores in this comment, but I'd encourage people to consider that Cassandra is designed for durable persistence and larger-than-RAM datasets.<p>As far #4, this is mostly false. Tombstones (markers for deleted rows/columns) CAN cause issues with read performance, but ""issues while GC'ing large number of tombstones"" is a bit of a hand-wavey statement. The situation in which poor performance would result from tombstone pile-up is if you have rows where columns are constantly inserted and then removed before GC grace (10 days). Tombstones sit around until GC grace, so effectively consider data you insert to live for at least 10 days, unless of course you do something about it.<p>Usually people just tune the GC grace, as it's extremely conservative. It's also much better to use row-level deletes if possible. If the data is time-ordered and needs to be trimmed, a row-level delete with the timestamp of the trim point can improve performance dramatically. This is because a row-level tombstones will cause reads to skip any SSTables with max_timestamp < the tombstone. It also means compaction will quickly obsolete any succeeded row-level tombstones.<p>Here's a graph of P99 latency as observed from the application for wide row reads (involving ~60 columns on average, CL.ONE) from a real 12-node hi1.4xlarge Cassandra 1.2.3 cluster running across 3 EC2 availability zones. The p99 RTTs between these hosts is ~2ms.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/WRdps3B.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/WRdps3B.png</a><p>This also happens to be on data that is ""ephemeral"" as our goal is to keep it bounded at ~100 columns. The read:write ratio is about even. It has a mix of row and column-level deletes, LeveledCompactionStrategy, and the standard 10 day GC grace.",1366478114

I will write an article on the flaws of anonymity.  Opportunity cost means trade-offs exist, but the internet already has plenty of anonymous conduits for sharing information.<p>Addendum to the JS thoughts:<p>As people saw with RSS after reader went down, the data structure isn't consistent across the RSS world either.  That makes the reader problem more complex than first perceived.<p>Rather than try to distill complex content and fit it into a para-structure, nwzPaper is designed to be a transparent third-party to standardize article format in the publishing form:<p>1) title
2) abstract
3) location pin
4) article body
5) media<p>Each article includes the journalist's name--not to be confused with the new legal distinction of blogger--and a link to his or her content inventory and a link to a structured ""perspective"" to interpret the journalist's information product through.<p>If a search engine or aggregator organizes third-party content there will always be an indexing/crawling delay.  That makes traditional search brands only useful for non-news, historic information query and analysis.<p>Search was a big deal ten years ago because it got rid of categories, but it is insufficient for solving the news problem.",1366477602

It's also a major field of research, and in many ways, much more sophisticated than other kinds of optimizing compilers.<p>In particular, it doesn't just optimize your algorithm, it chooses better algorithms for you.<p>It does this by collecting statistics about the data (and keeping them up to date), and using those statistics to estimate the inputs to each operator in a candidate plan (a combination of algorithms that answers the query), and then estimate costs, and choose the candidate plan with the lowest cost.<p>(The above explanation is simplified and not entirely accurate. It discards most candidate plans before they even really become a plan. And ""candidate plan"" is not really the right terminology, but I thought it was more descriptive at a high level.)",1366477583

What do they have to lose?<p>Money? Time? It wouldn't make any sense for them to litigate the cases they would obviously lose when they could choose the subset of cases where the take down issuer clearly has no copyright in the material in question -- which is the whole idea.<p>You're also giving the money to the wrong party. It doesn't make any sense to give YouTube or Tumblr the right to sue for bad take downs, if they thought they were bad they could just not execute them. The right for redress should be for the user who posted the material, not the intermediary. Which solves your problem with torrent sites filing frivolous claims. Do you honestly think release groups are going to get into the business of filing frivolous lawsuits against content owners?

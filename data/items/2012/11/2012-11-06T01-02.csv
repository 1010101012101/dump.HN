Even today I think the form factor makes up for the lack of a Retina display. I happily switched from the 3rd generation iPad to the iPad Mini. I'll miss the Retina display (temporarily) but I won't miss the bulk of the 9.7"" iPad. My iPad Mini has already left my house more times than my iPad 9.7"" has. It may not seem like a big difference but being able to pocket the iPad Mini in a jacket actually makes it a lot more like a big iPhone than a small iPad IMO.",1352167124

Our current system has no interest in building or finding solutions that help everyone, but instead in pushing their own agendas in the assumption that once ""we"" win, ""they"" will have to admit how right we were!<p>He's saying that our subjective opinions of what the facts SHOULD be (often our very notion of what is in our best interest,) should be investigated until we come to an objective reality of what is in our best interests. He's saying science provides those answers if we can get beyond ourselves.<p>He says we should not elect people only to chastise them for being both too smart, or too dumb. How, from that, do you get ""he's saying we're dumb!"" He's not saying someone is dumb, and someone is smart. He's saying as a scientist, it's his job to hunt for objective truths, and that as an educator, he seeks to teach everyone to find those truths.<p>Should scientists and educators not... Educate and seek objective truths? Isn't that kind of the point in those professions? What's arrogant about that? What's EXTREMELY arrogant about that?",1352167102

Imagine this: ""Pennsylvania-One"" is an AI. Every day, from their smartphones or another device, PA citizens vote on issues, ranging from small to big. Using this data, ""Pennsylvania-One"" creates a model of what its constituents want, and then, using its vast knowledge of political theory, history, economics, etc., makes a decision. This decision can be double-checked by constituents or by some other ""watchmen""-like individuals.<p>Of course, this would never happen (people trust people much more than machines), and it's more of a sci-fi idea, but it's an interesting thought nonetheless.",1352166936

4746858,comment,4744201,4746584,2,0,D_Alex,,,"As I read it, in the proposed system the heat generated during compression is stored, and then recovered, hence the advantage over the plain old air compression.<p>But I'm going to be that guy who says it will not work, and cannot work, based on fundamental thermodynamic theory. Here goes:<p>1. The best efficiency of a thermodynamic cycle is 1-TL/TH, where TL is the temperature of heat rejection from the cycle, and TH is the temperature of heat addition to the cycle. TL and TH are ABSOLUTE scale temperatures.<p>2. In the proposed system, TH is necessarily low, no higher than the temperature generated during compression. Efficient compressors work at low temperatures, usually no higher than 450 K (certain INEFFICIENT compressors, eg gas turbine compressors go as high as 700 K, the mechanical inefficiency gets converted into heat).<p>3. If <450 K assumption is correct... and if TL is the local ambient temperature (what else?) of around 300 K the MAXIMUM efficiency of the heat recovery cycle is 1-300/450, or about 33%. At least 67% of the heat energy would be lost, leading to a very low overall cycle efficiency, far less than you would get with say pumped water storage, or batteries.<p>Dani Fong, please comment on the above. I would be most happy if there was something wrong in my analysis, and the new technology was a success.",1352166812

4746825,comment,4746349,4746551,6,0,rndmize,,,"> Voters are not too ""dysfunctional"" or ill-informed to make reasonable decisions. Approval of the US Congress was at %10 in August, the lowest in 38 years. The electorate isn't smiling through the failures of government.<p>The 10% approval with Congress is only half the story. Those same people will tell you that they're 80-90% satisfied with their own congressional representatives. The reason the electorate is so dissatisfied with Congress as a whole is because they think either things aren't getting done, or they aren't going their way. Both are true.<p>And yes, voters are ill-informed and unlikely to make reasonable decisions. One needs look no further than Glenn Beck and the conspiracy material he peddled for several years to see how far the news has gotten from reporting actual news. I remember the ""cash 4 gold"" advertisements being prominent during his show; do you think that informed people were the ones making that business viable enough to advertise like they did?<p>A media that relies more on data, that provides context and scope; this is what we need to have to get informed voters, but a lot of people aren't smart enough to place value on that when they can get a daily dose of things to rage about and blame for their issues with the world.

Apple and Microsoft, however, deserve every kind of patent abuse they are getting (and then some).<p>This isn't patent abuse at all. The patents in question involve sophisticated, complex technologies (Wi-Fi and video compression). It's not the type of thing you accidentally stumble upon--these were technologies created by a consortium, including Motorola, at substantial cost. Licensing the underlying patents, and litigating if those patents are infringed, is how the members of the consortium recoup those costs. The situation presents the classical case of applicability for patents--you want the technology to be openly disseminated, so it can be used as a standard, but don't want people to be able to use it without paying.<p>As much as people kvetch about standards patents, they're an example of the patent system working well. You have an industry consortium (of specialists in a specific area) which develops complicated technology then standardizes it for everyone to use. Companies who want to be compatible with the standard then license the patents underlying the technology. The patents are just the legal glue that facilitate that transaction. Patent litigation is the mechanism by which the terms of that transaction are enforced--just like litigation is always the mechanism by which the terms of transactions are enforced.",1352164671

Now they've become Yelp 5-star and the place gets great business but wait times are always an hour.<p>Sometimes I'm in a new city and I just Yelp for the latest and greatest. This can lead me to some of the best food I've had, complete with menu suggestions and tips from other users. This is where Yelp really excels. It gives great businesses the business they deserve.<p>Where Yelp fails me is when restaurants get hurt by harsh and poorly written reviews. A few one stars will even make people avoid a business. I've been to a ton of 3 star restaurants personally recommended to me by a friend and they've been fantastic. When I read the Yelp reviews people will rate 1 star for entirely subjective reasons, even worse for poor service when the explained situation seems completely one-sided. It's one thing to give a highly rated place a second opinion, saying it's overrated. It's another thing to harm an innocent small business and in a way preventing other people from giving the place a chance.<p>And even with well-reviewed places, for large cities there are hundreds of great places buried in the 4-star <100 reviews list.

Should that set be all blogs hosted with WordPress or Blogger than yes, normal becomes having comments, because that's the default option.<p>But, if you use a different set, say a group of people who use Jekyll or another static site generator, than normal turns into no comments.<p>Do we include all sites that consider themselves to be a blog inside of this set? Should there be a number of readers over time and a number of posts over time requirement? Should the content being delivered be of a certain category? You can't say that a ""normal"" blog has comments without defining those, you can't even define ""normal"" without defining the set.<p>----<p>Definitionally, a blog does not require a commenting system. I said it before, and you seem to be refuting that. [Wikipedia says that](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog</a>)<p>> Although not a requirement [...] blogs are interactive, allowing visitors to leave comments<p>Yes, I took out the  ""most good quality"" part, because it shows a bias.<p>Princeton WordNet defines a blog as ""a shared on-line journal where people can post diary entries about their personal experiences and hobbies"", making no reference to comments at all. The Wiktionary also has no references to comments. [WordPress' Codex](<a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog</a>) likewise makes no reference to comments inside of it's blog definition. Same with [Blogger](<a href=""https://www.blogger.com/tour_start.g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.blogger.com/tour_start.g</a>).<p>There are many people called bloggers who's sites don't have comments, Gruber's Daring Fireball, Marco Arment's blog for a few.<p>----<p>You just proved my point about nobody needing comments. You use the term need, but imply want. Your blog has no commenting requisite, you just enjoy having them. Functionally it would have very few differences if it didn't have comments.<p>And, I never said nobody wants comments. There are many instances where people may have a site built like a blog where comments are meant to be a discussion board of sorts where some BBS for forum software would suit them better. There's no commenting requirement for a blog to be a blog.<p>Some people may enjoy discussion inside of a comments section of a blog, and some people may operate their website in a manner dependent on a comments section, but I would argue that in such cases they're the ones who aren't operating a ""normal blog"", and are instead operating a discussion forum of sorts.<p>Likewise, trackbacks, pingbacks, and refbacks are not required for a blog either. None of those are official ""web features"" as specified by the W3C or the WHATWG the two organizations considered to be the ""keepers of web standards"". And it requires additional work by the publisher as it isn't something that can be implemented by generic server software (note the generic part, server software created specifically for serving a specific piece of software could very easily implement them).<p>Plus, comments and all of the *backs require some form of a database to run, even if it isn't your own database. Are you saying that a database is also a requisite for a site being considered a blog?",1352164100

110542,comment,110489,110489,0,0,ballred,,,"Finally something I'm qualified to comment on! Like you, I'm not a coder but I read Hacker News frequently. I have started 2 web-based businesses, so I like talking to coders and finding out what they're working on. It's a great source of inspiration for the next idea. \nI also have to admit that there's a part of me that wishes I would have learned to write code so that I could do more prototyping on my own. I have a lot of respect for a software programmer that designs an elegant solution to a problem that we've identified.",1202342021

110525,comment,110017,110444,0,0,apathy,,,"When I worked at Cornell, we had a habit of naming pairs or groups of machines that were related (eg. as failovers, or multimasters, or whatever) so that the grouping was obvious enough to stick.  Hack/slash, itchy/scratchy, homer/bart/marge, etc.  My officemate and I had Indigo2's named squish and squash, for example.<p>I've done the same thing ever since, and if you look at truly huge deployments, you end up developing a lexicon that exists solely to indicate where and what a machine is.  eg. ""what's wrong with pyj121-200?  the whole rack is flapping!""  ""oh it looks like a bad blade in pyextbr2"" ""well open a ticket to swap the blade tonight then!  it's hanging index transfers!""  Datacenter, rack, machine.  Simple.<p>Meanwhile, at some of the smaller deployments I've done, there are machines named after porn stars (lovelace/holmes were a couple of onsite/offsite RAID monstrosities; bildo/remsen were hot and cold firewall nodes), musicians (mingus/parker/coltrane/monk), and so on.  Functional or physical relationships as indicated by lexical relationships are a relatively convenient shorthand, and if one machine turns into a farm, you have lovelace1, lovelace2, lovelace3...<p>Just some musings.  Thank god I don't work ops anymore.",1202339194

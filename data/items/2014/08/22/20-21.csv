As the gravitational wave passes through, particles in the material oscillate, producing their own gravitational waves.  The combined gravitational wave from the original gravitational wave plus the secondary gravitational waves is broader.  The increased wavelength implies a decreased speed.  An idealized equation for this index of refraction can be found in Eq. 18 here:<p><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00891464#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00891464#page-1</a><p>The paper calculates the index of refraction for the Earth and finds that n - 1 ~ 10^-17, so it&#x27;s a very small effect indeed.

If that&#x27;s too much for you, try one of his talks on the same topic[2].<p>When I first encountered the idea that we do not get fat from eating too much and that calories weren&#x27;t responsible, I thought it ludicrous—the body can&#x27;t disobey the laws of physics! Thermodynamics! But after seriously thinking about the idea, I realized Taubes was providing a far more complete understanding of metabolism. The human body doesn&#x27;t run on calories, it runs on food. Yes, we can easily learn the caloric content of food, but that&#x27;s largely irrelevant. What&#x27;s important is how food affects the body, not its raw energy content. I see this misconception time and time again, especially among smart people who like to reduce the human body to merely a physical machine, often ignoring the whole biology thing.<p>I think the hormone theory of obesity is correct and I think these studies will prove it.

This works because demand for food is predictable, fungible, and relatively constant.<p>Now imagine a natural disaster is expected and suddenly everyone needs to stock up on water and food. Retailers can basically inflate prices to whatever they like and people will pay, because  they desperately need that water and food and it&#x27;s not like a new retailer is going to set up shop and dramatically undercut them before the disaster hits.

This can take many forms, such as overwhelming media appearance in political campaigns/attack ads, large companies using litigation against smaller entities that can&#x27;t afford to fight regardless of their message, to &quot;laundering&quot; money through super PACs or funding think tanks and research groups whose sole purpose is to publish findings to the funding entities&#x27; benefit.

It&#x27;s about how computers work in general, and why this &#x27;blame the programmer&#x27; mindset is just dumb.<p>As you admitted, the API could have been designed better. That&#x27;s my point. Things that break things for users, especially those that take down entire systems, should be difficult or require more awareness to do, such as by naming it killall() like suggested in this thread. The human factors approach recognizes that operators aka programmers aka humans will not just make errors, but predictability so. We can incorporate those predictions into our domain and change design patterns to match.<p>There are many known patterns of errors that programmers make: edge case errors such as off-by-one, null dereferencing, etc.<p>Using the return value from a function is a common pattern generally. Having a return value that mixes an actual result (PID) along with an error code (-1) is problematic in that they&#x27;re both integers so there&#x27;s no obvious handler for the error case, and thus this cascade can happen. Then you add the fact that fork() rarely fails and that compounds the issue in hiding it into obscurity.<p>Generally when a system is maxed out of resources all kinds of things break and fail in weird ways; it just so happened that this particular cascade was super bad and needlessly so because of API design choices that have never been addressed.",1408740354

What happens often (but not always) is that drivers rush to the areas which are surging, creating a glut of drivers in the area, but, in most cases, because of the short window when the rides are needed, it creates an uneven redistribution of drivers which may no longer be appropriate.  It&#x27;s reminiscent of financial markets which have self-reinforcing feedback loops where the pricing system can creates mini-bubbles (I suspect, as kindleberger, bigger bubbles are caused by aggregation of mini-bubbles, that are the result of other, non-market, forces at play).<p>Really more than the pricing algorithm the competitive advantage of Uber and, more so, Lyft, 1) is aggressive rating of the drivers, which is a way of harnessing the community to police itself, and 2) being able to transparently watch the drivers come and get you and have the entire trip logged.  Both of these create accountability and reliability.  While taxis may be able to implement 2), I don&#x27;t see how they will be able to easily implement 1).<p>[0] an aside:  Spoke to an uber employee, typically when uber gets complaints about pricing due to surge, the response is, well, did you check uber black car?  Because it was usually cheaper to take an uber black car during that surge.  (The prices for each of the subsets on the uber system are modulated independently).",1408740225

When American introduced dynamic pricing, it framed the 21-day advance-purchase requirement as a chance to buy “super-saver” fares. And happy hours at bars are, similarly, framed as a markdown from the regular price. These framing devices don’t change the underlying economics or price structure, but they can have a big impact on customer reaction.<p>The difference between Matinee / Happy Hour (Discounts) and Surge Pricing (Gouging) is not a framing device, it is a fundamental difference.<p>One says, &quot;There is a basic price for this product or service which is fundamentally part of our business plan and represents the cost of doing business and some reasonable profit, but when the resource is under-utilized or we want to generate business, we will offer it at a discount - a price which we could not afford to offer at all times.&quot;<p>The other says: &quot;We are going to charge more when we can get it.&quot;<p>I do agree that Uber would be better off not taking a cut of the surge pricing, that would make it a clearer incentive directly to the driver, but in that case why not offer a bidding arrangement?<p>It is fundamentally about allocating scarce resources only to the wealthy, and creating an economy where people who are not wealthy rely on that, rather than a simple and fair wage.<p>I&#x27;m usually pretty soft on Uber compared to Airbnb, I am no friend of the Taxi industry, but surge pricing is shameful.",1408740177

My University offered them.<p>Now what I am about to say is &quot;unfair&quot; but realistic: Many people within the technology world won&#x27;t respect a Web Development degree as much as other similar degrees. They&#x27;re seen somewhat as an &quot;easy&quot; degree where you learn &quot;soft&quot; (non-transferable) skills.<p>So you might graduate and be great at PHP/MySQL/etc web-apps, but ten years later you need to learn some new language, and how flexible will you be? A Web Development degree only marginally adds to your flexibility.<p>My University offered the following courses: Computing, Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Web Technologies. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of them:<p>- Computing: Computer Science without the Maths (it is actually fairly theory heavy in programming, software engineering, and computers in general). Just CS if you took out the maths and put in other generic computing courses in their place.<p>- Computer Science (same as Computing but with a lot of maths classes and less generic filler)<p>- Software Engineering: &quot;The business of software development&quot; (this has all of the 101s from above, but is more business focused and management focused, it is a software project from the top down for medium to large-ish teams).<p>- Web Technologies: Same 101s as all of the above but in the final years you don&#x27;t do maths OR heavy theory, but instead do actual practical web development (using Java, PHP, and similar).<p>CS is the most well respected, then I&#x27;d say Computing and SE are similar, and finally Web technologies is last. SE has a nice niche for people who already have the industrial experience but lack a degree (essentially turning them into a future manager). SE is quite popular at Masters level after people do a CS at degree level (again, for manager credentials).<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of Game Development degrees around now, and some fledgling &quot;Mobile Development&quot; ones. I have no knowledge of how respectable Game Development degrees are in that industry but I will say a Mobile Development degree suffers some of the same pitfalls as a Web Development degree (no flexibility, just platform specific knowledge).<p>So decide wisely. As a final thought: Whatever degree you pick make SURE it is one you&#x27;re going to be able to pass and finish. The most important part of a degree is frankly a piece of paper that you spend $30-60K on, everything else, including actual learning is almost secondary. There are far too many CS washouts who couldn&#x27;t cope with the maths and who should have just done Computing or heck even Web Development (since a &quot;lesser&quot; degree beats no degree at all).",1408737977

Sticking to that dress theme, what were financial analysts talking about when Facebook was doing its IPO road show two years ago( <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/zuckerberg-takes-heat-for-hoodie-on-ipo-road-show"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/zuckerberg-takes-heat-for-hoodie-on...</a> )?<p>While some <i>unbehagen</i> is felt with these sartorial changes, the real threat to traditional Wall Street comes from hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies, which hires no financial people, yet has spectacular financial returns, pushing Jim Simons up to #34 on the Forbes richest list.  Renaissance hire astronomers as well as people like Peter J. Weinberger and Leonard E. Baum, but no traditional financial Wall Street people.  Tossing the usual nonsense has led to spectacular success, meanwhile banks like Lehman Brothers go under.<p>Other companies of a similar model have sprung up such as D. E. Shaw.  Many of these hedge funds are under the radar.  I noticed Andy Lutomirski of AMA Capital Management on stage at Linuxcon this weekend along with Linus Torvalds, Andrew Morton, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Shuah Khan.  These hedge funds are popping up and well-financed, and the traditional investment banks are beginning to build out in-house clones of these successful hedge funds.  But the culture hurts it - at Renaissance the quants and computer scientists are the profit centers, at traditional Wall Street investment banks they are still considered cost centers who take orders from the &quot;financial people&quot; in other departments.  How many people who start as programmers or systems/network/database/etc. administrators in the IT department at investment banks versus those who start off in sales or investment banking?  It&#x27;s a sign of how things are that so many of these hedge funds are popping up outside of investment banks.  It&#x27;s not just due to regulations.<p>One nice part of working at a large bank is they are global, and a software change you push out can go to London, New York and Tokyo, and be used by people worldwide, within a massive software, systems and network architecture and IT staff.  But you can get that experience working at Google or Facebook or Amazon as well.<p>There&#x27;s not much going for you if you work IT at an investment or commercial bank.  There are sinecures here and there, but usually you&#x27;re better off at a technology company where you&#x27;re seen as part of a profit center, not as part of a major cost center.  Banks are being forced to change due to outside pressure, but they are resisting the change from within.  If you like dealing with bureaucracy more than technology, working at a bank may be for you.  Otherwise you&#x27;re better off working at a technology company - or at least a hedge fund.",1408737900

Major crypto breakthroughs created there (in either breaking something/creating something) would be kept secret for years, so it just bogs down innovation.

As nardi and others have said, think of water splitting as a battery... or a way to store energy as a chemical fuel (i.e. hydrogen gas). Because your energy input can come from any source, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Agree that hydrogen isn&#x27;t an ideal fuel though. They&#x27;re overselling that point. But the science is about how to split water efficiently. It&#x27;s outside the scope of this research to address how to handle and use hydrogen after that.",1408737877

They provide maps to troops on the ground, determine what the NRO satellites should be looking at and merge all they produce (optical, IR, etc. imaging) and merge it with their geospatial and cartography data.<p>CIA, NSA, DIA along with NRO and NGIA are the big five.

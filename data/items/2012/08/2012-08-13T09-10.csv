An API that uses a naming-convention that emulates namespaces (e.g. as in Emacs Lisp) removes that problem. This also makes good harder to follow when reading, especially when C++ things like SFINAE are around and suddenly everybody is calling everything fully qualified again to make code look and be unambiguous.<p>Of course, that can be solved with proper tooling, but some people are just averse to using something more heavyweight than necessary.",1344851935

That master password should be passed through a key stretching function ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching</a> ) prior to use as the encryption key for the master encryption.",1344851795

It is also <i>very</i> expensive.<p>* The Olympus OM-D has a nice small body and classic shape, but it feels kind of cheaply built, and it has one of the <i>worst</i> electronic viewfinders I've ever used: very low res, and very flickery.  [I find the horrible viewfinder on the OM-D particularly depressing because the market has recently seen a number of cameras released with <i>vastly</i> better electronic VFs, e.g. the Sony NEX-7 and Alpha A77, and the Nikon V1.  Clearly there's no technical problem with making a good EVF these days.]<p>The appeal of those classic little SLRs was that they were small, light, and quite simple/straightforward to use, but also highly capable and very high quality (and ... beautiful).  They omitted gee-gaws without skimping on essential features.

My lifetime earnings will probably be a little lower, but the flipside is I'm now equipped to take on much more interesting jobs than I was beforehand.  If the timescale had been closer to 6 years I would be more inclined to think twice about it.<p>edit:  I don't mean to imply that a PhD is for everyone - I have friends who dropped out who made absolutely the right decision: they didn't want to become academics and had lost interest in their subject.  If anyone is in that position they absolutely <i>should</i> drop out.  The uninformed supposition that skills gained during a PhD are useless is frustrating to me, though - I really honed skills like the ability (and motivation) to investigate a topic area, present my work clearly, and learned a whole load of new technologies along the way.  These have all been invaluable to me - far more so than a little extra time in industry would have been.  I was certainly at a disadvantage at 0 years in industry compared to someone else with 3 and a bit.  A few years later, though, and I feel at an advantage.<p>I guess I'm also quite defensive about PhDs because mine holds a special place for me - it was during that time that I discovered how much I love to learn.  As a result I'm far more motivated to improve my knowledge than I ever was before.",1344851349

Often you'd end up with X.rpm needing Y.rpm v1.1 and Z.rpm needing Y.rpm v1.2, and you had to be really cautious not to screw up your system.<p>Now the argument that with BSD and ports you have no library problems because you compile everything from source and the ports are all centralized is, well, wrong. Say you install X and Y which depend on libZ; you then upgrade Y, which pulls in a new libZ, which breaks the unchanged X (since it has been built against the earlier libZ). That is, unless you rebuild X to link against the new libZ. Even heard of Gentoo's revdep-rebuild? Hopefully this is mitigated on FreeBSD (and conversely made comparatively worse on Gentoo) because <i>base</i> components do not get bumped like that, so most things link against the seldom moving <i>base</i> and you're done (whereas on Gentoo, you have fun bumping libc or libxml).",1344850122

However I did meet some people during my time at the methadone clinic that had what you are saying - a steady job, etc - but if you have a job and have to be at a clinic every day, which opens only from 8-1, and only serves 1 at a time, you better have an understanding boss...<p>with regard to 2, I don't know about methadone withdrawal being worse than heroin; worse here is perhaps relative; you are exactly spot-on regarding the aspects of both of them in terms of length - heroin withdrawal only lasts around a week, and incredibly you can't die from it, although it may feel like you will!

However within a short period AC increases leading to cAMP returning to normal levels, and thus the return of pain; amplified by sudden withdrawal of the opiate - now AC acts uninhibited, there is a massive increase in cAMP and thus the 'pain' of withdrawal is experienced as physical pain, as real as being cut open",1344849566

The main thing that I have to reconcile currently is the fact that BSD isn't on the bleeding edge like, say, Arch Linux. To give a specific example, until recently, mesa lacked full support for the Sandy Bridge mobile GPUs, and so I couldn't play Minecraft on Linux. Pretty much as soon as a version of mesa with support for Sandy Bridge was released, Arch had it in the repositories where other distros would have lagged weeks behind.

If you are really working 80 hour weeks then you are being incredibly foolish and wasting a lot of time being completely unproductive due to exhaustion.<p>But, of course, you don't really mean 80 hours, you were just exaggerating a bit to make your point.  Fair enough, lets say profs are putting in (I'm assuming a proper research university where tenure track professors teach 3-4 classes at most) 12 hours lecturing each week, for 30 weeks per year.  That's (at most) 360 hours of teaching, per year.<p>Lets say you spend 2 hours per week preparing for lectures (you should know this stuff already, but lets say you just need time to get organized).  That's 60 hours, yearly.<p>Now, lets say you spend 4 hours every day working on research.  Everybody probably would like to spend more, but some days you have to see friends or your wife/husband or kids or get your car fixed or whatever.  That's 4 * 365, which is probably a huge overestimate for most people, but that's 1460 hours per year.<p>Now, as for writing grant proposals, or mentoring students, or whatever else, nobody believes you are spending any serious time (more than 5 hours a week) on that.  I don't know how long you really spend on it, but I'm going to assume that you aren't writing more than 1 grant proposal per month, so I'm going to just say that I gave very optimistic and too-high estimates for everything else, so this will get rolled in as overhead.<p>So you're doing (drumroll) 360 + 60 + 1460 = 1880 hours of work per year, all but 420 of which is just thinking about the problems that interest you most.<p>If you work in industry, you are spending 220 * 9 = 1980 hours per year working on stuff that are not the things that most interest you, and almost none of it is blue-sky thinking of any kind.<p>Want fries with that?<p>Edit:  With my really crazy overestimates on how tenure track profs spend time, averaged over a regular work schedule it is 42.72 hours per week, of which 9.5 is anything at all besides pure 'research'.

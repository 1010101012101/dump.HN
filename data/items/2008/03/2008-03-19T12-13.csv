None that I'm aware of.<p>If SOX was working according to how its authors intended, we would have seen the warning signs much earlier.<p>As it exists now in practice, SOX is just a paperwork albatross.",1205931464
140770,comment,140651,140686,0,0,suboptimal,,,"I think in the right sort of corporate environment, a bit of initiative can give you a lot of opportunities the less-motivated might not have (or want). You also can learn how to work in a team, and probably have better hours than your startup counterparts, giving you more time to work on outside projects--such as your own startup--or in general to just have a life, meet people and pursue hobbies.<p>I like having some distance between me and management when I'm working as an employee, because then it doesn't grate on my nerves that I'm not working on my own startup while watching someone else run theirs, with the knowledge that they're using me to make their own dreams come true. I'd rather not see that, and in a large organization you don't have to because they're somewhere else, in a different building perhaps, or political appointees, for example.",1205931376

140763,comment,140651,140711,0,0,suboptimal,,,"""It depends.""<p>Taking a contrarian point of view, at the major corporation you might find yourself on a smaller team not unlike a startup, with supportive management, opportunities to work on diverse projects and a clear path for career growth and advancement.<p>I worked at a company with several thousand employees that was much like the above. I bailed after a few months to go back to doing my own thing, but in retrospect it would have been a great company to continue working for. Several managers asked me to stay, not because I'm Mr. Wonderful but rather because they genuinely cared about keeping people on-board. One day after I left I had a voicemail from someone at the company, and I never returned the call because I figured it was some HR flack doing a survey or something. I later looked up the person's name and learned it was the Senior VP--that's how much they cared about losing an employee.<p>I also worked at a small startup that kept us working 7 days a week, including holidays, for several months, then made a bad deal and dumped us all.<p>""It depends.""",1205930813

It doesn't mean you don't have to work, but it pays for just about all of the things you end up working the first 15 years of your life for - house, furniture, ""stuff"".  Once you've purchased all that crap, any money you make over and above that actually seems like a lot more because it's not going toward buying couches and bedroom sets.<p>I made my first million when I was 22, and though it didn't keep me from working ever again, it basically paid for all of the things I needed.

Put the million in a savings account, move to an affordable area and rent, or purchase a living space and bank the rest, then live (modestly) off the interest.

We went to an immunologist who sat on his hands and waited for several months for her thyroid to get enough out of whack before he ordered more testing. We've had several incompetent doctors who failed to diagnose conditions that harmed her health and the health of our son. On the other hand, since we've moved and had to find new doctors, we've gotten some really helpful doctors who really know their business and have been clearing up longstanding immune problems.<p>The right doctors have really been great for us, the wrong doctors have really been bad.<p>The first close citation I found for your argument was here:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/03/AR2007120301771.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12...</a><p>There was a study that most doctors have high standards, but they would fail to report colleagues who didn't meet those standards. However, they appear to claim that reporting would not solve the problem, just lead to its own set of headaches.<p>I would say that America needs to follow the money to get to the bottom of this problem. The prices of medical care just aren't commensurate with the costs anymore. Ease the financial pressure and the whole system will probably improve.",1213893735

Eat 5-6 small meals throughout the day, every 3 hours or so, avoid refined/simple carbs, aim to get your calories from 40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat, all from a variety of sources, aim for 25g fibre a day. This is right because it's what humans evolved doing. The <i>difficult</i> part is doing it in the modern world.

I am a voracious reader, with normally 3-4 books on my reading stand at any point that I read at different points during the day.

I have found myself going back to several books over the years, because some are _that_ good.<p>Having said that, there are a lot of crappy books out there (I have commented about that earlier) and invariably you will get one that is despite checking it out (amazon reviews etc). That has not prevented me from continuing to find good books, and it should not deter anyone else either.<p>A quick cursory glance over amazon's best-seller lists will give you a good overview on the types of fictional books, and you will quickly see that almost every kind of curiosity can be satisfied - technical, mystery, espionage, war strategy, sci-fi, you name it...<p>And yes, staring at a tube-light all day cannot be a good thing...",1213892866

A high-quality, nutrient-dense breakfast is vital. Coffee and a pastry doesn't cut it for me any more. A big bowl of porridge with a handful of berries and a little maple syrup is just about perfect for me, a few simple carbs to kickstart my metabolism and complex carbs to power me 'til lunchtime.<p>When I have the opportunity I like to make it the old-fashioned way, soak the oats in warm water and a drop of vinegar overnight, then heat it up slowly in the morning, add a pinch of salt and a little butter (NOT margarine or ""spread"" or any of that modern rubbish).

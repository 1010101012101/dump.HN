The DOS TSR model they have pushed since the 80's could only go so far.  UNIX models are now, we know with 20-20 hindsight, the only viable long term OS model.<p>And what did M$ bring to the table, exactly?  Everyone says ""They made the desktop a reality when Apple were charging too much!"" - maybe so, but did you NEED that desktop?  No, really, seriously, did you need it?<p><i> PC's were incapable of running serious apps simultaneously until about the time Linux's X started to really work.\n</i> Word 5 for DOS was probably the last decent version of Word.\n<i> OS/2 was a near-perfect OS for small scale applications\n</i> There were others, nearly all forgotten.<p>So what was Windows?   I'll tell you.\nA backplane that allowed Word and Excell to be run at the same time.<p>I'll re-iterate that.<p>Windows was only ever: A backplane that allowed Word and Excell to be run at the same time.<p>All the hard work is done by the application writers.<p>AND - before you squawk ""Driver Database!

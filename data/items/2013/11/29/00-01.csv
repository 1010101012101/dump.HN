(And &quot;softens the stigma&quot; is a honest way to describe that part of the rationale, as well... because some listeners will consider the stigma a good thing, while others see it as a barrier to the policy&#x27;s intended effects.

I am now 100% node.js and python, but I probably would not have made it in the door if it was not for C# when I was starting out. The job market heavily favors devs, and the tooling makes it possible for self taught people to gloss over the fundamentals until they have enough time to go back and learn them. Also, if you think Stackoverflow is useful as a dynamic language dev, you would not believe how much more useful it is as a C# dev.

I&#x27;ve had the javascript blocked around in my general web browsing, never installed the phone app, etc.  All I&#x27;ve ever received is the occasional email saying that someone has tagged me in a status/photo.  These annoyed me a little, as I wanted to avoid FB as much as possible, whilst still being sociable with my friends.<p>I came to a sad epiphany a few months ago however.  I realised that even if I weren&#x27;t aware of all the photos/tags being posted of me, I&#x27;d still be tagged by my friends regardless.  Even if I completely cancelled my account, the photos are still going up because I still meet with my friends and have an active social life.  This is when I realised what I needed to do.<p>It is the exact same situation as when someone makes a small jest at your expense at a party.  If it&#x27;s a friend, you know they&#x27;re just messing around and taking the piss, you laugh it off, not offended.  If it&#x27;s not a friend however, you might get a little offended by it.  &quot;Were they insulting me? Trying to embarrass me?  Should I laugh it off as a joke?&quot;  It&#x27;s potentially annoying, just as a violation to your privacy is.  Inevitably, you have only a few choices:  Laugh, insult them back?  (guess it depends on your culture/how rude it was!)  Some people might even just punch the guy...<p>You can&#x27;t punch Facebook. (I wish)<p>It isn&#x27;t gonna go away just because you&#x27;re upset.<p>So the question here is:  Why do we laugh these little embarrassments off?  The little invasions of our private self that we find annoying?<p>Because it&#x27;s a way of owning the situation.  You can&#x27;t be offended/embarassed by something you laugh off and apparently don&#x27;t care about. &quot;Yeah, my Karaoke is terrible, but I love it!&quot;, &quot;Yeah, I do have a habit of giggling in a funny way, hahahaha!&quot;.  \nIt&#x27;s exactly the same when you look at highly confident people, they never seem embarrassed by anything at all.  They just smile and carry on.<p>Well I made a decision a couple of months ago to take the exact same approach to Facebook, so I&#x27;m on it properly now.  I can&#x27;t punch FB in the face,  but I can take ownership of my own public persona.  My friends/aquaintances are going to be posting about me regardless, might as well take control of the situation and make sure I <i>know</i> everything is good.<p>PS:  And hey, there are still plenty of good uses of FB anyway, might as well enjoy the perks too.<p>PPS:  I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s a shitty situation.

It leaves me with the financial stability to play around with ideas in other languages at home, without having to fight for a relatively small job market comparatively.<p>REALLY learning C#, understanding what happens when you drag and drop the aforementioned gridviews and sqldatasource objects onto pages, is also super important, but I do wonder what percentage of other platform developers really know what&#x27;s going on in framework calls they use?",1385683758

I think there are a lot of people out there who just want to quickly grab some Bitcoins and hold them for the long term.

The risk is obviously that as the exchange operator you become a bitcoin speculator because you&#x27;re holding bitcoins that may not end up being paid for by a customer, so not a good idea with the volatility we are seeing, but I think that&#x27;s the only way credit cards would work.",1385683263

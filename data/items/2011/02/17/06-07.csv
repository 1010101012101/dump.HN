WTF?",,"<rant>\nI noticed a few days ago that search wasn't working on my Posterous blog, so I dropped an e-mail to their help desk notifying them of the issue.  Later that day, I got the following response:<p>""This is a known issue and should be fixed soon. Stay tuned!""<p>Uh, ok.  So based on this e-mail, Posterous would have me believe that this is a temporary bug and one that should be fixed pretty quickly.  After all, search is a core feature, so it seems reasonable to expect they'd have this problem resolved in no time.  To have such a core feature go down is embarrassing to say the least, and does not inspire confidence in the platform or the company.<p>Well, here it is several days later and search is still broken.  So I drop them another e-mail asking them what's up.  The response this time absolutely blew my mind:<p>""We're working on a new search system and hope to have it deployed in a future update. This shouldn't affect searching using google or other search engines.""<p>Really, Posterous?  You have got to be fucking kidding me.  That's the best you can offer?  What company in their right mind takes an existing feature offline that users have come to rely upon while they develop a new version of that feature, especially one with no release date attached to it?<p>And what is even more galling is the suggestion that I point my users to Google or ""other search engines"" to search my content.  How irresponsible and unprofessional is that?  What's worse is that they have not made any announcement (that I can find, at least) on the matter, either on their blog or on Twitter.<p>On the flip side, they did just release a new feature giving readers a ""new way to like"" posts.

There's a lot of attraction there, especially given that the alternatives (i.e., Android) not only aren't there yet, but aren't even close to getting there.<p>So right now, if I had to choose where to put my budget, I'd put it into iOS without a second thought; sure, Apple's going to get a cut, but the reduced overhead and relative ease (if I want broad exposure on Android, how many app stores do I have to market my content in?

Buying a non-dividend-yielding stock is a bet that the price of that stock will go up, while selling a share is a bet that the price will go down. (yes, that's simplified)  Doing all that research is like counting cards - you have a lot better information than the average investor, but you can't know for certain whether you should hit or stand on that 16, just what the best play is.  So the GP's argument is that banks didn't actually know the securities would go south, but they knew it was more likely than the buyers thought.<p>The information that the originating banks had that many investors didn't was that the loans were lower quality than mortgage loans had been in the past.  So the investors were making their pricing calculations based on historical default data, which would obviously underestimate the default risk, causing them to think that the securities were worth a higher price than they would be if priced with a more realistic default rate in mind.  And it wasn't a small difference.  It was like a 10x difference in the default rate, which would have made lower tranches nearly worthless and really cut into the value of higher tranches.<p>Let's use a car analogy.  I want to sell my (hypothetical) 2005 Prius, and you're interested.  You take a look at the car and it appears to be in good shape, so you're willing to pay roughly the Blue Book value for it.  However, I know that the car is actually in need of serious maintenance costing thousands of dollars, and will probably break down on you before it's gone 10 miles.  Obviously, I just withheld crucial information and sold you a lemon, with major penalties.

When you get into a car, you are placing a lot of trust in the 'professionals' (i.e. the engineers, the safety inspectors, the government regulators, Consumer Reports, etc) that the car is safe, why is a mortgage that much different? To many in our society the inner workings of mortgages (and personal finance in general) are just as transparent as how their car works. You can claim that if they should have educated themselves until you are blue in the face, but (1) we live in a society that doesn't exactly promote/reward that very well, and (2) the mortgage brokers probably pretty heavily tried to convince the consumers that there was no need to even 'shop around' to other brokers let alone spend the time to educate themselves on how their mortgage was going to work (hell, I'm sure some of the mortgage brokers probably didn't even know this; just how to fill out the paperwork to get the mortgage going).",1297923440

They got the results that they had aimed for, but reached it by means that they hadn't expected (or even wanted). The implications of this are the effects it has on the potential applications and projects based off of it. Using brute force to solve these projects will not always work - at some point, this method will have to be replaced by another one. Instead of bringing computers closer to the human brain, these projects are revealing the large gap between them.<p>In my opinion, the ""Next Big Thing"" should be a proper merge of the intelligence between computers and humans. Each has their own strengths, and trying to recreate and incorporate the complexities of the human brain into our computers may not be possible. Instead we should put the efforts into finding a way to connect the two and discovering a common interface between them.",1297923262

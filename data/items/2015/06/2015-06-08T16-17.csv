That&#x27;s not very long for a kid that&#x27;s seriously into a game.<p>Is it possible that you are also going through non-rechargeable batteries reasonably fast, but don&#x27;t notice because, say, the kids can change those without your involvement, but with rechargeable batteries you are the one who handled recharging so saw every battery swap?<p>Another thing to watch out for is that alkaline and NiMH have very different discharge curves. Alkaline starts at 1.5, then falls steeply to around 1.3-1.4, then drops at a more gentle rate down to around 1.1, and then plummets.<p>NiMH starts at around 1.3, drops to 1.2, and then stays close to level until near the end, then starts dropping faster for a bit, then goes over a cliff.<p>If a device was not designed specifically to allow for NiMH, it is going to assume a discharge curve that follows the alkaline profile. When it uses voltage to estimate how much battery life is left, it is going to get confused by the NiMH curve.<p>If you put fresh NiMH batteries in a device, use it a while, and check the battery level, it will be reported as much lower then it really is. This can fool people into replacing the batteries early, because they figure it is falling fast and they don&#x27;t have much time left.<p>I had one device where it would report not long after I put fresh batteries in that it was down to 60%, and if alkaline had fallen to 60% that fast, it would be time to put new batteries on my shopping list...but in reality with the NiMH it would actually stay at about 60% for weeks.",1433782435

Ultimately you want your mentor to guide you as much as possible and the client to understand this relationship.  It shields you from unreasonable expectations.<p>Doing this, a) you get to work on a real-world project (it pushes you forward faster with issues that a side project usually doesn&#x27;t... if for nothing else you&#x27;re interacting with others on their schedule, their whims), b) you get on-hands training, and c) you get access to the networks of your mentor/client if the relationship is fruitful.<p>I did this back in 2012 - the only work I had done prior to this was going through the Hartl Rails Tutorial.  The initial project lasted for 4 months @ ~20hrs/week and I was paired with someone who was an early engineer from Gilt Groupe.  During this time I continued to work my day job.<p>Toward the end of that project my mentor brought me the opportunity to bid a long-term gig.  I quit my job the day the that contract was signed w/ about 3 months of financial runway.  A few months later he brought me another, and that work kept me going for over a year at an overall cashflow greater than I had made at my enterprise job.  Toward the end of these engagements I started consulting for a local startup which converted into a FTE situation for a year and a half.   Now I&#x27;m back consulting on another long-term project by way of a recommendation from the design team on one of those earlier projects.<p>The one thing I will say about consulting is when you&#x27;re starting out communication is more key than technical skill.

But I&#x27;m not sure overwhelmingly is accurate either, especially for back pain.  With carpal tunnel, it&#x27;s clear based on the plethora of cures with random success that calling psychogenic may often be right.  But back pain has alternative, and seemingly better explainations (weak muscles, poor flexibility).  So while TMS may be the diagnoses for some with back pain, and a contributor for others, I would not go around slapping it on everyone who says they experience back pain.<p>That said, Dr. Sarno&#x27;s book is worth the cost of reading.  It&#x27;s very staunchly in the pseudo-science camp, and Dr. Sarno spends a lot of time bemoaning his ostracization from the medical community, but his theories are ultimately interesting, hold some weight, and have been helpful to many.  For example, I haven&#x27;t worn a wrist brace to bed since I read the book (about a year ago).  And, even if it hadn&#x27;t helped, it brought more awareness to just how stressed I was.

It is a dreadful job that they do, an almost superhuman job by the standard of an ordinary person. For they are not only shifting monstrous quantities of coal, they are also doing it in a position that doubles or trebles the work. They have got to remain kneeling all the while--they could hardly rise from their knees without hitting the ceiling--and you can easily see by trying it what a tremendous effort this means. Shovelling is comparatively easy when you are standing up, because you can use your knee and thigh to drive the shovel along; kneeling down, the whole of the strain is thrown upon your arm and belly muscles. And the other conditions do not exactly make things easier. There is the heat--it varies, but in some mines it is suffocating--and the coal dust that stuffs up your throat and nostrils and collects along your eyelids, and the unending rattle of the conveyor belt, which in that confined space is rather like the rattle of a machine gun. But the fillers look and work as though they were made of iron. They really do look like iron hammered iron statues--under the smooth coat of coal dust which clings to them from head to foot. It is only when you see miners down the mine and naked that you realize what splendid men they are. Most of them are small (big men are at a disadvantage in that job) but nearly all of them have the most noble bodies; wide shoulders tapering to slender supple waists, and small pronounced buttocks and sinewy thighs, with not an ounce of waste flesh anywhere. In the hotter mines they wear only a pair of thin drawers, clogs and knee-pads; in the hottest mines of all, only the clogs and knee-pads. You can hardly tell by the look of them whether they are young or old. They may be any age up to sixty or even sixty-five, but when they are black and naked they all look alike. No one could do their work who had not a young man&#x27;s body, and a figure fit for a guardsman at that, just a few pounds of extra flesh on the waist-line, and the constant bending would be impossible. You can never forget that spectacle once you have seen it--the line of bowed, kneeling figures, sooty black all over, driving their huge shovels under the coal with stupendous force and speed.&quot;",1433781710

For example, in the Netherlands, all business-to-consumer contracts must follow the principle of &quot;reasonableness & fairness&quot;. I can&#x27;t give you an exact definition, but a &quot;gut definition&quot; is that if the judge looks at it and his gut feeling is &quot;this is bullshit&quot;, then the contract is probably not legally binding. For example, as a consumer, you cannot agree that you have to sell your house to the other party for $10 if you fail to pay for the $30 service within 20 days. That would be an unreasonable claim.<p>Business-to-business transactions are however not subject to such protections. You can put anything you want in a contract (including unreasonable clauses) as long as it doesn&#x27;t violate any laws.<p>The US is a common law country and as far as I know doesn&#x27;t have this &quot;reasonableness & fairness&quot; principle for business-to-consumer contracts. In contrast to civil law countries, where judges tend to look at the spirit of the contract, common law country judges look at the letter of the contract.

Google never gave any information on who searched specific terms, but after some attacks on their servers in an apparent attempt to get this information, Google announced they would no longer filter searches for China.  Talks on how to accomplish this broke down, and Google redirected their China site to Hong Kong, which has no censorship restrictions, but the Great Firewall seems to be filtering results.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google#China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google#China</a>",1433781207

Nothing like communing with the mac faithful once a year- back when being a mac developer meant having trouble finding jobs where you actually got to do mac development.<p>Seriously, I got hired more than once to work on a mac product, only to be shifted over to windows soon after.

Many of the other commenters are pining on about how nothing has been done about the state of surveillance since the Snowden/Binney/Drake/Risen leaks, but what everyone is either not saying or ignoring is that the buck stops with the Executive branch.<p>I keep wanting to cheer for the exec. It should have some of the best intelligence in the world on subversive actors at play in the beltway and wallstreet, so I often expect a power play against those interests. Given that the exec repeatedly fails to do so tells me one thing:<p>The executive is already compromised. Uncomfortable conclusion to say the least. I mean more than just monied interest making donations too, as should be obvious.<p>I have two main questions: was continuity of government (aka shadow government) put into operation on 9/11, and does it still continue? I haven&#x27;t found anyone but Peter Dale Scott asking these questions, and I never hear any answers.<p>&quot;What is the first step out of this current state of affairs, in which the constitution appears to have been superseded by a higher, if less legitimate authority? I submit that it is to get Congress to do what the law requires, and determine whether our present proclamation of emergency “shall be terminated” (50 U.S.C. 1622, 2002).<p>As part of this procedure, Congress should find whether secret COG powers, never submitted to Congress or seen by it, are among “the powers and authorities” which Bush in 2007 included in his prolongation of the 2001 emergency.<p>This is not a technical or procedural detail. It is a test of whether the United States continues to be governed by its laws and constitution, or whether, as has been alleged, the laws and constitution have now in places been superseded by COG. &quot;<p>What I would say is that as a former Marine and a combat vet who tried to understand the &quot;why?&quot; behind the war(s), I consistently return to Smedley Butler and the attempted facist coup known as the business plot and Butler&#x27;s testimony to the committee.

Hence the business class owns both parties.<p>All these are tough and complex issues and many of the answers are dirty and unpleasant. The American people are propagandized into the ground by the same interests, which is my main quabble with those who just want to blame the American people for their ignorance and apathy.

Open source developers working at a company would be loyal to their open source projects first and foremost, but would accept direction and feature prioritization from the sponsoring company.<p>Just because something isn&#x27;t a company doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not valuable and doesn&#x27;t deserve compensation for services rendered, but in the current environment that&#x27;s the only way forward until more fundamental change appears.",1433780441

9680056,comment,9677758,9679731,0,0,pron,,,"> Why then do you think at a certain point they start hurting<p>Oh, it&#x27;s just a guess, but partly because of Haskell and its success at being continuously rejected by the industry for two decades now (it was touted as the next big thing when I was at university over 15 years ago). There have been few if any languages of Haskell fame that have clearly tried to break out of academia and have had so little use in the industry.<p>And the problem is less with types themselves but with the referential-transparency-everywhere and non-strict-evaluation approach. The result is that Haskell allows -- nay, demands -- a lot of reasoning about the program upfront <i>at the expense</i> of reasoning about it as it runs, with a debugger and a profiler (because of the complicated execution model). I also think Haskell places an unreasonable burden of thinking about the types vs. the algorithm an domain.<p>As to Scala, because it&#x27;s such a &quot;multi-paradigm&quot; language, it&#x27;s pretty hard to know exactly <i>how</i> it&#x27;s used in the industry. There are certainly those that use it anywhere between Haskell-like with scalaz to Java-like only without having to write constructors and getters (in fact, Spark is written, I believe, closer in the latter style). But even if Scala is to be counted as an advocate for rich typing, its success record is pretty spotty (and, again, I wouldn&#x27;t blame that necessarily on the type system).<p>I could, of course, be very wrong. One thing is certain: <i>what</i> a type system can do is a comp-sci question; how useful it is is a psychological question, and trying to argue about the usefulness of type systems (or any programming approach) as if it were a mathematical problem is just silly.<p>> We&#x27;ve certainly never reached that &quot;certain point&quot; where they start hurting.<p>I think Haskell is beyond that point, although I still believe a language with a type system <i>as sophisticated</i> as Haskell&#x27;s might not be (because getting more for the same price might be worth it). By that I mean that Haskell types -- just like the article said -- waste a lot of mental power in the wrong places (i.e. on proving trivial stuff). I don&#x27;t know what that imagined language would look like, but it would probably have some effect types (and like the author of the article has noted, there&#x27;s a huge difference between being able to simulate effect systems and effect systems controlling actual effects).",1433780354

A better way to look at strength is to look at who has been winning the battles. If you look at the past 50 years, the left has won most of them.

There&#x27;s a certain amount of relativity to it... we&#x27;re post-singularity for a cave man, for instance. AIs that are smart enough to program themselves will result in a world so radically different that there is no meaningful way to plan for what to do from here in 2015.<p>In the future before then, which for all we know may well encompass the entire lives of everybody here, and assuming no major civilizational hiccups (which may not be &quot;singularities&quot; but are also fairly difficult to predict around), programming will be one of the few fields that probably will continue to grow more or less indefinitely for the forseeable future. More stuff is going to be programmable, and the advantage for a company to have better programmer better than its competitor will likely also grow.<p>In fact I think there&#x27;s a decent chance that demand for programmers, and especially <i>good</i> programmers, is likely to rise beyond the base level of people who are even theoretically capable of becoming that level of programmer. I suspect we have not actually seen peak salary in this field for good programmers.<p>(Interesting tidbit... programming has the tendency to &quot;eat&quot; other fields, as others have noticed. Even if genetics and biology manage to do everything that they&#x27;ve ever promised... the top level of biological designers are going to look an awful lot like programmers, moreso than biologists, precisely because the only way we&#x27;ll ever have that level of control over biology is to abstract the issues away until we have a programming language on top. Nobody can work at the raw gene level, at scale. Oh, it won&#x27;t be C or Haskell or Python, but it&#x27;ll still be a programming language. Probably declarative.)<p>I&#x27;m not just trying to say good things to make us happy; this has been my assessment of the field&#x27;s prognosis for a while, even since before the bubble pop, and I&#x27;ve seen nothing to make me change it, even the bubble pop and the 2008 crisis. Even if we are in another bubble now and <i>it</i> pops, it would have to <i>epically</i> pop, like, the entire country, person by person, decides this whole &quot;Internet&quot; thing is a total waste of time forever for all things, for me to change my mind.<p>The fact that I feel this way about this field and that I work in this field is not a coincidence. Per my comment [1], when in 1996 I mentally did what I suggested in that post and &quot;computer programmer&quot; popped out in my second slot for Jobs I&#x27;d Like To Do, I was pretty grateful, and, again, have seen nothing to make me change my mind since.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9667145"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9667145</a>",1433779982

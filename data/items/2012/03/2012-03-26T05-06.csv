Something in which I can develop large scalable systems. I've read Mark Jason Dominus's Higher order Perl and used many functional techniques in Perl. I've watched SICP-MIT videos a while back and I'm completely convinced of the technical merits of lisp.<p>So my question on learning lisp is more on 'making a living' reasons. I want to give sufficient time and learn clojure as a primary language in which I want to spend time working on in the future. So the questions are.<p><pre><code>    1. How will learning clojure help me in job/career areas?
    2. Will learning clojure be helpful to switching to other Lisp dialect if they come up in the future.

But everyone lives in a bubble, there's different kinds, sizes, and geographical dispersion levels of bubbles, and there's nothing wrong with living in a geographically concentrated one. Capitol Hill gets you to either U District or Lower Queen Anne with an easy 20 minutes transfer-less bus trip, it's 15 minutes to Belltown, and so on - it's really far from a teeny tiny bubble.

Go through the list of biases and think of specific examples from the past few days for as many of them as possible, and check if they've been affecting you. Keep repeating this so you learn what it feels like when those biases are affecting you and so you can avoid it in the future.

3755108,comment,3753856,3753856,4,0,jes5199,,,"I had an idea to write Clojure parsers for the standard unix command line tools that translates the output into s-expressions.<p>I got too frustrated - on the one hand, Clojure's slow start up time meant it was no fun to use in a simple pipe<p>and on the other hand, even the simplist unix util has surprisingly complicated behavior. Like `wc` - it outputs three columns of numbers, right? Well, unless it knows filenames, which go in a fourth column. Or unless you pass it flags, which can turn any set of the number columns on and off. And then I thought, wait, what happens if you make a file which has leading whitespace in the name - it turns out it only outputs a single space in front of the filenames, so any whitespace after that is part of the name.<p>Which lead me to the conclusion: unix tools aren't actually simple - they are actually really complicated, but you can construct a happy-path of simplicity for most use cases<p>and functional languages are still monolithic when it comes to interacting with the outside world. Maybe someone will make a service I can run in the background that will run my command-line clojure scripts in a pre-warmed JVM, but that's not a piece of technology that <i>I</i> want to try to write.",1332738631

There is absolutely an opportunity in 3rd world countries to leapfrog credit card systems, which for a variety of reasons don't work in these environments.<p>There's a mobile phone currency company in Kenya called MPesa which is currently processing 20% of the countries GDP!

I'm curious to benchmark the implementations and see the performance difference.<p>Maybe you or someone else knows the answer to this though: it seems like they are processing 4 bytes of the string at a time. If they read over (i.e. the NULL byte is in byte position 1 2 or 3), isn't that technically undefined behavior? They are only reading in the memory, but I feel like valgrind or another tool would spit out an error if that happened. It's aligned, so it won't trigger a page fault, but it seems like an unsafe optimization.",1332738092

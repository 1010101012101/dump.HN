Wearing a cap with a peak/a visor/similar (it&#x27;s all about shading the eyes) & turning the brightness of the screen up also helps.<p>To the OP: if you want to combine work and being outside and have everything that&#x27;s necessary - basically a laptop which won&#x27;t immediately overheat and whose battery is still doing alright (+ a WIFI stick if you need internet[1]) - go for it!

On GMOs particularly, there are a ton of malnutrition problems we could potentially solve with this technology, and sacrificing that for political expediency does not seem reasonable.<p>Edit: And we&#x27;ve only begun to scratch the surface of what GMO is capable of; even if banning it were worth it now, what future applications are we preventing? It would be like deciding the internet wasn&#x27;t worth the child porn it facilitated, but <i>in 1996</i> (certainly banning the internet then would be simpler and more expedient that trying to figure out how to monitor it for that kind of thing). So more generally: killing technology because of it can be misused destroys not just its current utility but all sorts of unimaginable future potential.

7866491,comment,7862973,7863224,2,0,turingcar,,,"For the record, AppleScript is not “natural language programming”; it is merely more similar to English than most programming languages. As with most mainstream programming languages, human terms (usually English) are used for keywords like “if”, “then”, “else”, “while”. It still has a very limited and structured grammar, like most programming languages.<p>In deference to the expressive flexibility demanded by humans, it does provide a few alias terms (“=“, “equals”, “is equal to”) and a few places where something can be written either left-to-right or right-to-left (“name of document” vs. “document’s name”), but even that is common in other languages. e.g., document.name vs. name(document), foo(bar.baz()) vs. bar.baz().foo(), and C’s support for both ”! && ||” and “not and or” operators.<p>Obviously, tastes vary, and I’m not trying to convince anyone that they should like something they don’t, but often people who complain that AppleScript is unlike languages they are more familiar with have only taken a cursory look at examples of AppleScript and are unaware that it has a syntax that is in fact similar to other languages. The primary differences are that it is very light on punctuation and prefers using descriptive words over abbreviations, because its goal is to be approachable for first-time and casual programmers. Even for AppleScript experts, this often helps make understanding or maintaining code easier.<p>Personally, I’d like to see AppleScript support some more “compact” syntax, like square brackets for array references, but I do not think it’s reasonable for AppleScript’s target audience to have to learn the meaning of “a ? b : c” before they can read simple conditional statements like “if a then b else c”.",1402274541

If marketers are abusing it, users will very quickly deny their future pushes (after the fact, Safari -> Preferences -> Notifications).  If email had such a built-in opt-out feature, I doubt spam would be what it is today.<p>Beyond that, we&#x27;re definitely aware that there needs to be a steward of the channel.  If people abuse it, we lose.  There are things that can be done with throttling that we hope to implement soon.  Hasn&#x27;t been necessary to this point.",1402272415

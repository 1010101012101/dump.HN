A normal boot of an Amiga system would typically result in over twenty processes running in the background. In fact, its particular style of multitasking (static absolute priorities) was well-suited to real-time operation. Back in the days when CD writers could create coasters from buffer under-runs, I had more success writing CDs using my 25MHz Amiga than my 400MHz PC. Also, it was a microkernel system with things like device drivers and filesystems as separate processes, which had some fairly nifty consequences. For instance, it took Linux ages to lose its single kernel spinlock, which was a problem because of the huge amount of stuff done in kernel space. The thing the Amiga didn&#x27;t have (mostly because of lack of hardware capability) was memory protection.",1385376600

If you want to claim taxation is voluntary, stop paying taxes and see how voluntary it actually is. But as mentioned before, you already know full well it&#x27;s not.<p>>> However, there was a hell of a lot of death there; in a society like that, if you screw someone, they may kill you.<p>You may have noticed the vast majority of people not being savage animals? Why would this be any different without a government?<p>>> Why would capitalism be the default system with no state regulation?<p>The word &quot;Capitalism&quot; has been tainted by Marxism/government propaganda, but what it actually entails is property rights combined with people making voluntary exchanges, agreements and investments. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s important to realize that capitalism is not some kind of &quot;system&quot; that would be imposed on people - it&#x27;s what we do <i>in any case</i>.<p>Saving and investment is the basis of all human wealth, because without savings, there can be no productivity improvements.

Money alone is not a problem, even if someone has shitloads of it. People can be enslaved only through coercion, through the initiation of force. You need to threaten someone with violence if he doesn&#x27;t obey you. Sure, you <i>may</i> be able to hire an army of mercenaries to help you <i>force</i> people to do something, but then people can just organize against you and <i>kill you</i>, if necessary.<p>Even if you&#x27;ve got ten trillion dollars in your bank account, you still don&#x27;t want to die, right? Your actions have consequences, and one of them might be your own personal death, so you&#x27;ll want to avoid making <i>that</i> choice.<p>>> It works pretty well for the people at the top.<p>Huh? Enslaving other people works well for the people at the top? As in, the sociopaths in government who went there for that specific purpose? Well yeah, that&#x27;s about right.<p>>> We use fiat currencies, so many people would begin producing their own.<p>People wouldn&#x27;t use fiat currencies anymore, they&#x27;d use a currency that can&#x27;t be manipulated by anyone, and that would be great for everyone. Have you got any idea how much of the dollar&#x27;s purchasing power has evaporated during your lifetime? That shit wouldn&#x27;t happen in a free market. Who does inflation hurt the most? -The poor, of course.<p>>> Lot&#x27;s more people would lie about their product&#x27;s efficiency, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry.<p>There would be independent, third party quality assurance services, and so on. And they&#x27;d all be <i>responsible to their customers</i>, unlike government agencies. The government is not responsible to anyone for what they do, and that&#x27;s a massive factor in how fucked up everything is.<p>>> Some people would seize all the valuable land and resources<p>Or not? That&#x27;s just a scaremongering assumption, like just about everything else you&#x27;re saying. But even if that were true, would it be better to have a group of sociopaths (=government) seize anything and everything at will?<p>>> In a slave scenario, I not only take 100% of the product of a slave&#x27;s labor, but I also choose what they labor upon, if they can marry or have relationships, what they read or watch, where they can go and what they can do.

In other words, the only thing they care about is maintaining their tax farm. Any time there&#x27;s a threat to this model, they do everything they can to neutralize it. If a specific regime completely loses its credibility and &quot;legitimacy&quot; in the eyes of their tax cattle, then they have a choice: 1) step down, or 2) set up torture camps etc and rule by sheer terror.<p>But we&#x27;ve been through your pseudo-argument already.

E.g. the cult may decide the explanation for the failure of whatever event they are waiting for is that they have not been devout enough, or that more believers are needed, and redouble their efforts to bring about their goal.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think the Heavens Gate site should be taken offline, mostly because there&#x27;s plenty of worse material online, and unlike most extant cults Heavens Gate is pretty much entirely extinct, so they are not much of a danger to anyone.<p>But don&#x27;t assume a &quot;failure&quot; in predictions mean anything to these cults, even if a failure can be objectively proven.",1385375882

This should be built into the law though, not into unions.<p>And no because the existing unions don&#x27;t really protect people. If you look at RMT, Unison and NUT they regularly pop up just to cause trouble. From a perspective of people having to consume services offered by their staff regularly, they want masses of additional pay and do not improve standards along the way <i>at all</i>. They are simply allowing the incompetent to be propped up by the good staff. Also, the professional minority who agree that this is the case are forced to be dragged into union ballots and vote with other staff in favour of strike action regularly in fear of retaliation from their colleagues.<p>Also let us not forget a much greater threat of exploitation: being forced to work with no pay under the guise of &quot;training&quot;. This is happening a lot in the UK a the moment as the Job Centre has been pushing for people to do this by threatening to cut their benefits if they don&#x27;t do it. The result is people being forced to work for no compensation and having to pay for travel expenses out of their own (literally destitute) pocket. The employers don&#x27;t have to pay the staff either. The result of this is a dangled carrot of &quot;if you do this, after 6-12 months we&#x27;ll give you a permanent paid position&quot;. This inevitably results in being laid off as not needed immediately when they agreed to take you on.<p>There are even posters going up in Job Centres telling people &quot;try staff for free&quot;:<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/SdWpgvx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/SdWpgvx</a><p>Edit: Also I&#x27;ve spoken to some business associates (the sort who worship the fully paid up Lord Fuckwit Sugar himself) and are applauding this as a great way of building their businesses.

You can&#x27;t attack the cryptographic function or the keyspace, but you can attack the original passphrase that is hashed, via typical hash cracking methods (rainbow tables, bruteforcing, dictionary attacks, etc.). All you need to know is the hash function; most brainwallets use a single round of SHA256.",1385374086

None of these things are compatible with Christianity as it has been understood for most of its existence.<p>&quot;Incompatible&quot;? No, those things are perfectly compatible. Don&#x27;t believe everything the fundamentalists feed you. Christianity is not first and foremost about the sex stuff; it&#x27;s about the love stuff. True, gay marriage is new and controversial, but contraception has not been much of a problem outside the Vatican.<p>Also, you make it sound like Ireland is somehow very progressive, but they&#x27;re actually extremely conservative on these things. There are other countries that were Christian long before the 800s that have no problem with any of these things, nor with euthanasia or abortion (within reasonable limits).",1385373896

That CS grad could be working on very difficult problems... or he could be pushing web apps for the next four years because his interviewer promised him cool toys and tough problems and then bait-and-switched. Not all of the school programs are top notch. Not all of the students that pass those programs will remember half of what you mentioned in your post or even recall the solutions when a typical problem is staring them in the face. His confidence will be misplaced, and now you&#x27;re back to where everyone else is: assessing actual skill instead of guessing with credentials.<p>Frankly I&#x27;m alarmed that you&#x27;ve placed so much faith in that credential. For America in particular it really doesn&#x27;t mean that much on its own unless you went to a well-known school. Not all CS programs are created equal. I&#x27;m certainly not going to burn cash and time because of spooky predictions of developer armageddon. People with four years of actual experience will be just fine.<p>Personally I&#x27;d be more interested in security-oriented devs. That&#x27;s more important than knocking a few thousand cycles off of your algorithm.",1445565597

JWTs aren&#x27;t in OAuth 2.0.<p>If the author had realised this, surely when looking for libraries to assist with the project he would&#x27;ve looked for an OIDC or JWT library instead of something specific to Google.  There are plenty of library recommendations on the JWT website[1], including .NET.<p>It&#x27;s not like OAuth 2.0 or OIDC are trivial to use, but these aren&#x27;t easy problems to solve.  OpenID Connect is young, and there&#x27;s still a lot lacking in terms of library support and (probably more importantly) documentation.<p>I&#x27;d rather deal with the rough edges of OIDC than use SAML any day of the week.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jwt.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jwt.io</a>",1445565583
10436397,comment,10430627,10433511,0,0,geofft,,,"Why do you want both processes to accept? That sounds like a bad thing, since you can&#x27;t test to make sure the new server came up right. You have no way to make sure you&#x27;re hitting the new process, until you tell the old to stop accepting. And you want to be able to recover if the new process doesn&#x27;t work.<p>What I&#x27;d suggest is to add a &quot;stop accepting&quot; and &quot;start accepting&quot; signal, maybe a URL route that checks that it came from localhost or something and sets/clears a flag. If the flag is set, the mainloop skips all calls to accept().<p>So the full set up is, first the old process stops accepting, but keeps the listening socket open, so new connections queue in the kernel. Then you start the new process and make sure it works. Then you shut down the old process. If the new process doesn&#x27;t work (e.g., accepts connections and returns 500s or something), then you&#x27;ve lost some requests, but the old process is still around. So you can signal it to start accepting again.<p>Maybe this is overengineering, but the case I&#x27;m worried about is where something in the state of the old process is important (it has an open database connection, it has a module loaded into memory that got corrupted/deleted on disk, etc.). So if you shut down the old process before you test the new one, you have no guarantee you can get the old process back up if you need it. You may have lost the node entirely.",1445565581

10436388,comment,10432704,10435777,0,0,lloyd-christmas,,,"From the student side, I&#x27;d say the admissions were crap. I was wait-listed simply because they lost my application. Our class ended up with 15 people who lived and breathed code for 3 months, along with a few nine-to-fivers who treated it as a work vacation. Shockingly, they were the ones who were allowed to control the pace. I ended up with one of them as a partner on one of the projects. His only contribution was a single line of &quot;code&quot;... his name on the README.<p>Admission gripes and crappy students aside, the rest of the learning environment was great. The teachers were always willing to give more outside work if we wanted more. It was invaluable having classes overlapping and students at different learning stages sitting next to each other in the community workspace. Most people were happy to provide help. I even had the dumb luck of sitting next to Ryan Dahl while I was learning node (I had no idea who he was at the time); now I use node all day every day.",1445565464

It really adds nothing to the discourse.<p>Having a family full of conservatives (mind you I can&#x27;t speak for all), I can tell you that for them, it comes down to how big the system is and what benefits should be provided by the government or not. The difference in where the line is drawn and why it&#x27;s drawn is the difference between conservatives and democrats.<p>They think that outcomes would be better with a smaller federal government, that it is not the responsibility of the government to take care of everybody, and that everyone would be better off for it. They think that the federal government should deal with defense, foreign diplomatic policy, and inter-state issues, not insert itself into every aspect of policy making nationwide. They think that governments closer to the people can respond better to the needs of the people.<p>So yes, that does mean that it shouldn&#x27;t redistribute wealth, at least on the federal level.

The lower layers of the Internet don&#x27;t care about names; why should the lower layers of a computation system?<p>To be practical, though, I think the point here has to do with the idea that languages come and go, and their package namespaces along with them, but VMs stick around as long as useful libraries run on them... <i>unless</i> the VM is tied in some way or another to a language that has gone out of fashion.<p>Think of the JVM: even if you&#x27;re writing Clojure, you call Java functions by their Java names. Effectively, you have to know a (tiny) bit of Java to call those functions. Why? Because Java syntax assumptions are baked into JVM&#x27;s module/function naming rules. Clojure functions end up with Java-like names too, after compilation. Clojure hides it from you, but to call a Clojure function from Scala, you can&#x27;t write a tiny bit of Clojure; you have to write a tiny bit of Java. Naming rules have made Java the only first-class JVM citizen.<p>Nock, on the other hand, defers the concept of naming up to the language/platform level. Effectively, each language running on Nock needs to make up a naming rule, and decide the canonical name (canonical to the <i>language</i>, not to the VM) for every available function itself. This means that there would be no de-facto &quot;Urbit library ecosystem&quot;; there couldn&#x27;t be, as a particular arrangement of Urbit functions—a taxonomy—wouldn&#x27;t be guaranteed to survive in any sensible manner between languages. Not all languages would have the concept of a &quot;module&quot;, or a &quot;package&quot;, etc.<p>This could be seen as bad: every Urbit-derived language would need to effectively create its own ecosystem of &quot;library taxonomies&quot;, manifests mapping from its module system out to function-space, making each language maintainer roughly like a Linux distro maintainer, consuming functions from &quot;upstream&quot; and packing them.<p>But this lack of forced naming also has the potential to be very good: it creates the opportunity for taxonomies to be created <i>separately</i> from any particular language, and then <i>consumed</i> voluntarily by multiple languages. A taxonomy becomes its own first-class object, above &quot;runtime&quot; but below &quot;language&quot;, where languages can pick a runtime+taxonomy to support. This, further, moves the creation of a &quot;standard library&quot; from the language authors to the taxonomy authors; languages &quot;on&quot; the same taxonomy become thinner bundles of syntax and compile-time features, while sharing all their stdlib algorithms, &quot;primitive&quot; data structures, and language &quot;features&quot; like GC (because that&#x27;s mostly up to whether the data structure &quot;primitives&quot; provided by the particular taxonomy are implemented that way.)",1445563822

I suppose you do something like:<p><pre><code>  where(what: &quot;year&quot;, max: 1985)\n</code></pre>\nbut you still have to invent a standard set of parameters here: min, max, eq, notEq, lessThan, lessThanOrEq, like, etc. Again, totally ad hoc.<p>GraphQL, not being a language, also doesn&#x27;t support variable bindings. So you cannot do self-referencing queries like &quot;find all movies with a director who also acted in it&quot;, because that would require some kind of variable support.<p>(This is not a criticism of GraphQL, by the way. It&#x27;s great at what it&#x27;s defined for.)",1445563339

It emerged much earlier in the 20th century, from a mix of electric-powered organs and various other early electronics, with many of the inventors working independently. The boundary between &quot;organ&quot; and &quot;analog synthesizer&quot; has a gray area, and there were some unique pre-Moog instruments like the Theramin. Moog&#x27;s contribution was to make programmable synthesis more affordable and standardized for professional use - but many of the &quot;synth-like&quot; sounds used in 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s records are organs with effects pedals put on them; small electronic organs had become affordable in the post-war era.<p>The distinctive-yet-samey sounds of the 1980&#x27;s aren&#x27;t entirely attributable to presets; the presets are a symptom of the underlying appearance of digital technology in music. Digital simultaneously opened up new realms of affordability and privilege - at the same time you got cheap tone boxes like the Casio VL1, you also had monsters like the Synclavier, used on &quot;Thriller&quot; and in many movie soundtracks, with high-end configurations billed in the ballpark of $500,000 dollars(1980&#x27;s money). Digital gear also changed mixing in favor of extensive production, leading to the heavy reverb washes and gated snares everywhere. Using a &quot;high end&quot; sound was a status symbol, so it was flaunted even if that meant you were using the same orchestra hit as everyone else.<p>The reappearance of analog is attributable to the same backlash seen in every media market that has experienced a race-to-the-bottom in price points: Synth designers have decided to do an end run around the piracy/DRM/price-pressure issues by going back towards manufacturing. The sounds are &quot;classic&quot; now, and marketed as such, with a few new tricks added to keep up interest. Musicians often get into very idiosyncratic workflows and for some of them, working directly with knobs and patch cables is the right way to go.",1445562299

I don&#x27;t consider that correct encoding, as &quot;&lt;&quot; is not a special escape sequence in JSON, and expecting API consumers to either blindly trust you did their escaping for them, or HTML-decode JSON strings to use in another context, is silly.  It is probably another symptom of something HTML-escaping the title when it shouldn&#x27;t be.",1445562098

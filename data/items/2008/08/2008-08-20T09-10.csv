Why should I care what investors care about - I'm trying to make a product for users, and not for investors. A few thousand people following my product is EXCELLENT, because out here in RL, a thousand people are not following me.<p>You have the wrong attitude if you are only focused on what investors want.",1219226288

281332,comment,280544,281214,0,0,Tichy,,,"You have to be careful with ""explain"" - sure you can ""explain"" anything with a presumed genetic disposition. That is in general not really a proof, only yet another theory. I just wanted to point out that there are alternative explanations.<p>For example, Europeans tend to be really good at soccer, whereas Americans suck at it. Is it genetic? I highly doubt it, since the European genes are readily available in the US. It has a cultural reason (simple statistics - popular sports - higher percentage of kids trying it - higher percentage of talents being discovered).",1219225042
281331,comment,280015,280737,0,0,ralph,,,"You used `md5' in your pipeline, I assumed you meant md5sum(1) as I'm not aware of an md5 command.  md5sum gives a 32 character string that's the 128-bit MD5 digest in hex.  Therefore it uses only characters 0-9a-f making the password weaker.  I'm sorry that you find this criticism ""silly"" but others reading your pipeline may not, like you, realise its flaw, you got an upvote after all, and use it.",1219224347

It's like that old qoute about democracy from Churchill (I think it was him) ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others"" I've heard so many horror stories about ISP's that I kind of think they all stink like dirty socks. Might be some really nice smaller ones though, dunno.",1208325514

164904,comment,164093,164890,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I have to agree there. Fatdoor raised themselves enough to be able to try something else when Idea A looked to be a dud. And exit strategies don't even come into play yet.<p>Also, their new idea seems to be a logical extension of (and possibly an improvement on) the old one. If Idea B works they will be fine. If not, they'll be no less or no more bankrupt than if they raised less money earlier.<p>If some omniscient person told me my idea was going to turn out a dud, I'd want more money rather than less.",1208324676

164891,comment,164560,164560,0,0,jonah,,,"Data integration is a big factor. Basecamp doesn't use my LDAP directory. Nor does GMAIL.<p>That's a big problem I see with the uptake of Web 2.0's SAS model in the corporate world - each app is a data island. Initiatives like OpenID or OpenSocial are great within the sphere, but doesn't do much for interoperating with the legacy systems companies have in place.<p>I see that as a market opportunity as well.  I have some ideas and wish I had the time to do something about it. ;)",1208323123

He has no knowledge that those things are true for FatDoor and nothing even anecdotal from other companies.<p>He does have a point that if they didn't execute well the first time, that doesn't bode well for the next try. However, that's not a problem with capitalization, that would be a problem with the team.<p>I was on the Odeo team that became Twitter. We were overcapitalized for a podcasting startup and that's exactly why we ended up with a bigger hit. We had the runway to experiment and the knowledge that we hadn't hit on anything big enough, so we kept trying new things.<p>In that case overcapitalization wasn't a problem in terms of being successful.",1208323116

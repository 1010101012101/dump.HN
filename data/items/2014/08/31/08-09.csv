8248812,comment,8248609,8248609,4,0,eemax,,,"Are there really people other than philosophers who are actually  &quot;Bayesians&quot; or  &quot;Frequentists&quot;?<p>Frequentist statistics are just a special case of Bayesian statistics with certain implicit, built-in priors - if you pick these priors using Bayesian statistics you&#x27;ll get the same answers.<p>The frequentest toolbox is just a collection of these useful special cases of Bayesian statistics with priors that usually make sense in practice. The advantage is this greatly simplifies the statistical analysis for many problems. Sometimes these methods fail though, when the priors they rely on implicitly are far off from the actual, and so a Bayesian analysis is needed.<p>Of course, sometimes it&#x27;s difficult or impossible to use Bayesian methods.<p>It&#x27;s analogous to classical vs. quantum/relativistic physics. For many cases, you can get the right answer to a problem using classical physics. But under certain conditions, classical physics breaks down, and you must apply quantum or relativistic physics to get a meaningful answer. On the other hand, for many problems it would be silly or impossible to use quantum or relativistic physics because classical is perfectly good.<p>So you might get into argument about whether a specific case can be adequately handled by frequentest statistical methods, or whether a bayesian analysis can/must be applied.<p>The philosophical debate about the different approaches to the nature of probability is just that - a philosophical one, and one that has no real bearing on the usefulness and correctness of bayesian or frequentist statistics in practice.",1409475562

However, it will screw you for certain use cases.<p>In my opinion, it really boils down to how much global interaction you have in your app. If you simply render a lot of models that can only be changed trough the view, then I don&#x27;t really see a reason for a Flux like architecture. Two-way databinding is perfectly fine there. (React vs whatever then boils down to performance vs toolset)<p>If you do a lot of graphical stuff that allows for heavy interaction, filtering and other kinds of stuff, I believe that two-way databinding will be your downfall. You need to clearly and explicitly map out on how data flows through your app. That is the time where an architecture like Flux shines.<p>So ask yourself this question:<p>&quot;How often can a user do something in your app, and a lot of Views need to rerender?&quot;<p>If the answer is &quot;often&quot;, then you should consider something like Flux.

8248775,comment,8248609,8248721,24,0,keithwinstein,,,"Don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite what the author was getting at. A &quot;frequentist&quot; who makes a decision based on a p-value or confidence interval, and a &quot;Bayesian&quot; who makes a decision based on a posterior or predictive probability distribution, can both be viewed as making a decision according to a procedure that minimizes some statistic of a loss function.<p>Both of these broad families of methods are diverse, but to generalize broadly, decisions informed by &quot;frequentist&quot; tools are often concerned with the worst-case value of the loss function within some universe, and decisions based on &quot;Bayesian&quot; methods can be viewed as caring about the expected value of the loss function given some prior.<p>Both of those families (and many others) are &quot;the ground truth,&quot; in that they both make statements that can be proved as theorems of mathematics. A &quot;frequentist&quot; confidence interval will always achieve its guaranteed coverage no matter what, if the likelihood function is true. A &quot;Bayesian&quot; credibility interval will include the true value of the parameters at exactly the advertised rate, when averaged over each possible value of the parameters weighted according to the prior, and assuming the likelihood function is true.<p>The author says, and I agree, that the thing worth arguing over is the &quot;norm we use to choose our optimal procedure&quot; and the nature of the loss function. Whether you care about controlling the worst case or the expected value or something else depends on what matters. (The author points out that in an adversarial situation where your strategy is known to your opponent, minimizing the worst case may be advisable...)<p>Some days, we care about the worst-case performance of QuickSort, and some days we care about its average-case performance (given an assumption that all input orderings are uniformly likely). It&#x27;s ok to care about different things depending on the application; we don&#x27;t have to split into warring tribes over it.<p>More here: <a href=""http://blog.keithw.org/2013/02/q-what-is-difference-between-bayesian.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.keithw.org/2013/02/q-what-is-difference-between-...</a><p><a href=""http://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/a-fervent-defense-of-frequentist-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/a-fervent-defens...</a><p><a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/stats-essay.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/stats-essay.pdf</a>",1409473761

As the costs for this is just so obscenely high that no private company would be involved if they had to pay for it from the meager profits they&#x27;d made from the electricity they&#x27;d produced.

8248748,comment,8248300,8248722,2,0,throwaway5752,,,"AMAZING. That $2000 bottle of Margaux takes over 600 times as much energy to produce as Three Buck Chuck. I knew it tasted better for a reason.<p>edit: and fine, be a pain. Let&#x27;s make it apples to apples and make it an ROI comparison.  So $500 you can keep the panel, but I keep the retail power cost of $.15/kWh and will also increase retail prices by 4% over a 25 year period. I&#x27;m going to use 10mWh again. So 400kWh/yr, or $60 in year 1. In year 1 dollars, that is $1500 over the life of the system. However, using a handy compounding interest calculater, the 4% annual increases in power cost increase the lifetime cost of non-solar power by a factor of 2.5, so that&#x27;s $3750. So we have a 600% financial ROI. That&#x27;s unrealistic for solar and I&#x27;m ignoring the NPV, but I&#x27;m just working with the numbers you handed me.",1409472499

This is, of course, philosophically ridiculous, since they proceed to ground <i>rational</i> belief <i>in</i> Bayesian statistics.

There is a huge difference in the level of teaching at compulsory schools and universities in Finland.""</i><p>Actually the opposite. The university system follows pretty much the same paradigm of equality and fair quality. There really is no shitty universities (at least within the institutions which claim the label...) nor spectacular ones. You get average quality. The university rankings tend to have an apex-fallacy (we are only interested on the ones at top), whereas the primary-education studies focus on national averages.<p>E.g. US has some spectacular private primary education facilities and some amazing higher education. But the quality varies highly across institutions. Finland has a very few private schools and even the best ones do not really perform significantly better the worst ones. The same is apparent in higher education. You get about the same degree from any university willing to give the education.<p>And whereas I used to think like you guys on catering for the individuals and the talented: I'm no longer quite sure on how it should be done. I've seen a fair share of different systems and products of those systems - some of which claim to address the problem of the gifted better than others. Yeah, you could do better to give greater challenges for the gifted. But there are so much other good and useful stuff people-who-get-bored-in-math-class could be doing. If you got the capacity, usually you end up using it, despite on how you are instructed to behave. You could be doing vector-calculus on the first grade: or you could be assisting your friends with the standard calculus. You could qualify for deeper math in high-school, but you could also spend your extra-time with arts, philosophy, student activities or just living your life if you don't have to worry about your school performance.",1318787997

The tradeoff is that you have to think through the various dependencies at a detailed level, which can be difficult.

3117780,comment,3117099,3117315,25,0,CoreDumpling,,,"Story of my life, Ed.  I am your poster boy who lives ""cheap"" and not ""frugal"" by choice.  I clip coupons and browse slickdeals before committing to a purchase.  I never buy anything at MSRP.  I monitor airfare prices for weeks before booking a ticket.<p>This is a difficult problem to escape because it's one that <i>I behaved myself into</i>, and that it's self-reinforcing for a variety of reasons:<p>- When you're already on a fixed salary, the opportunity cost of spending time on being cheap is not obvious.  You're not taking time away from that $500/hr side consulting gig that you don't have.  Instead, you're at a situation where the marginal rate of return on clipping coupons (say, $10/hr) is significantly better than spending the next hour working on that iPhone app that is months from release and has no interested buyers (how long is it going to take to recoup the Apple developer fee?).<p>- Some people get a rush out of saving money, a feeling of <i>""Ha! I beat the system.""</i>  To them, saving money is a form of entertainment [1], and there's certainly far worse hobbies to have from a well-being perspective.  Unfortunately, there are people who take this too far and end up as total misers or compulsive hoarders.  I'm not a pathological case, but I've done things that would make some people cringe.<p>- Seeing people successfully live frugally can be a motivator to follow in their path.  My parents are immigrants who worked hard and saved for 20 years before they were finally able to afford a house in an expensive neighborhood (and nearly paid for it all in cash).  They drive Toyotas, shop at Costco, and cook at home.  They are basically the epitome of the ""millionaire next door"" [2].<p>- There's also a moral justification for this.  <i>""Why do I have to keep up with my spendthrift neighbors?  So what if I don't drive a Maserati or carry a Hermès bag?  No thanks, I shall be comfortable in my own skin, since envy and greed are evil.""</i>  This is now an identity statement [3], and while it's a good position to take from a financial perspective, it can be crippling in the way it makes some people closed-minded.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily stop them from pontificating about retirement at 30.<p>I do still think that my years of being cheap are starting to pay off, mostly because I'm finally getting comfortable with the sort of ""discretionary"" expenses you mentioned in your post.  The difference is that it probably took a much larger bank balance for me to consider them ""affordable.""  I just flew across the continent purely on a whim to visit some friends that I hadn't seen in years, I no longer cringe at expensive bar tabs if they were time well spent with buddies, I can afford to make an impulse electronics purchase just to see what it's like, and I'm preparing for that self-funded sabbatical [4] to reboot my life.<p>Was it worth it?  Well, it was really, really hard to re-orient myself this way, and it took much more sacrifice than necessary, but the good news is that aside from lost time, most of the rest hopefully can be recovered.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-sex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-se...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/dp/0671015206"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/d...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html</a>",1318786662

The people I've seen in yacht clubs were mostly successful on Main Street, and there wasn't a penny of VC equity in sight.<p>My mention of a pizza shop is dead on the center of the target:  Now a Web site serving a few dozen Web pages a second takes much less in capital equipment to get started than a pizza shop.  And the Web site has some advantages, e.g., once the site is up, mostly just lean back and let the servers do the work, 24 x 7, and that beats the heck out of all the food handling, kitchen cleaning, floor washing, worker supervising, customer interactions, etc. at a pizza shop.<p>I and likely nearly all of us have neighbors in big truck, little truck businesses, fast food, gas stations, rental property, various trades, etc.  They make it, buy houses and new cars, get their kids through college, etc. without a big failure rate and without VC.  A Web site can be a better business, still.<p>Since on average, as reported by Mark Suster, VCs are not making much if any money, I have more respect as businessmen for a guy running a pizza shop, especially a guy running several, than I do for VCs.<p>For technical expertise, maybe in all the US a dozen IT VCs have some significant technical qualifications, and otherwise they would be at best just dead weight in an IT startup.  So I can't respect VCs technically either.  VCs commonly have a LOT of trouble handling their e-mail; NOT good.  VCs commonly want others, lawyers, CEOs, bankers, etc., to 'filter' entrepreneurs for them; NOT good.  VCs commonly assert that they have wide 'networks' -- mostly not among well qualified technical people!  Nearly none of the VCs are anything like the people I respected in math and physics in school or like the people I respected, say, at Yorktown Heights.<p>VCs need entrepreneurs more than entrepreneurs need VCs.  So, I'm not here to suck up to VCs.  For what PG wrote, I call BS.  So be it.  There's nothing wrong with that.  HN is for 'hackers' who should not be sucking up to VCs.",1318786602

Chef lacks a remote trigger mechanism.<p>Issue one starts to kill you once you have a large number of nodes. Dedicating a quater of the available memory to configuration management seem like a poor financial choice. We've come up with work arounds at my company(generate files centrally, and distribute with chef remote_file syntax), but I still feel they are hacky.<p>Issue two is more serious. Reindexing on chef only occurs after a node has submitted its node object back to the chef server. This results in incomplete searches until a node successfully completes a run. If you wish to remove a node from a particular role or attribute from a host, you may have a hard time doing so until the next chef run completes.<p>Problem three is really a result of the expense of running chef. If the memory and CPU costs were lower, there wouldn't be any real issues running Chef more frequently. Some changes I need to go out immediately, some don't matter.

Imagine B sleeps through the first decade but then takes off and has stellar growth during the second decade. What sort of investment patterns would you expect to see in that second decade? Clearly, you would expect investment from A to be declining, and investment from B to be rising. But A probably built up some impressive production facilities back when it was doing well, and it can coast on those production facilities for awhile. It can continue to produce large amounts of units, without investing a lot more in new facilities.<p>My point is, one has to be careful when drawing a relationship between present levels of investment and how many units a company can build. Past investments in production can allow a company to coast a long time. Building up production facilities is more expensive than maintaining them.",1318785277

Their grades were always low because they rarely completed the assigned homework. They had no social life in football season, literally no social life. I had a friend who would be grounded if he got an after school detention, because it meant he missed an evening practice. He didn't get punished because he'd done wrong, he got punished because his dad wanted him playing sports.<p>I played video games. I had lots of free time to socialise with friends, my grades were always excellent. Me and my friends would get together for gaming parties, 8-player C&C games, Halo 4 player deathmatch tournaments, etc. I spent most of my time interacting with people. Even when I was at home playing games, half the time I was online with my high school friends.<p>Why is there a line drawn in allowing parents to forcibly confine their children into organized sports because a very slim minority that don't get serious injuries and manage to play in the top 5 percentile <i>MAY</i> be scouted and then <i>MAY</i> get picked to play for a professional team. If not, they're just a loser that spent way too much time playing a game and achieved nothing.<p>At least video gamers tend to lead a life because they need money to buy games.<p>It may be true that video games are addictive, but so are cigarettes and alcohol and the majority of addicts lead normal productive lives because these minorly addictive substances require money. This money requirement means people work, which mean people socialize.<p>Most gamers I knew as a kid had paper routes or mowed lawns for money. Why? Because money bought games. The kids playing sports didn't have paper routes, they didn't have the time. They never did a job until they graduated highschool.<p>Myself at 15 was working as a video game reviewer.

2926192,comment,2925292,2925447,14,0,lotharbot,,,"I suspect at least a part of increased tribalism is that, without visible comment scores, people aren't being shown as clearly that ""that's not the HN way"" and ""this is the HN way"".<p>On the rare occasions that a tribal comment gets downvoted to gray, this is often misinterpreted as ""tribal downvotes"", and therefore the tribe responds by upvoting (a power even new users have).  As long as the comment gets back to 1, it appears the same as comments at 5, 10, or 100 -- so the tribe doesn't see how differently tribal and non-tribal comments are treated, and therefore doesn't learn the community standard.<p>I think visible comment scores would help.  I also think it would help to aggressively flag such comments, and to respond to such comments with ""this sort of tribalism doesn't belong on Hacker News"" (especially if that response was, visibly, upvoted to 10 or 20 points!)",1314302392

There's a meme developing where people treat Jobs like he lived a charm life of constant victories but that really isn't the case.  When I started High School people were telling Steve Jobs jokes in Usenet.  He was the fallen genius who never lived up to his potential (the Mac was all but dead at this point and Apple was licensing the OS in a desperate attempt to save it)<p>In that way I think the story of Steve Jobs is one of the most inspirational for people.  Almost everything people associate with Jobs today are things he did after his 40th birthday.  Even the Mac (OSX is really NextSTEP repackaged)<p>In an industry that obsesses over people in their 20s there's a lesson to be learned there.",1314302131

People like ""hackers"" that are interested in learning how things tick from young ages, who are constantly trying to learn new things, who have that thirst for knowledge. I've met people throughout my short career who have asked how they can do what I do. The easiest answer is you can't, if you don't have the inherent ability to search out the answer to that question on your own, and figure it out on your own, you aren't fit to be a programmer, or..a hacker...<p>Also this may be off topic but colleges are businesses, and a business has one goal - to make money. I do not believe in the higher education system that the U.S. has. I believe that higher education should be a not-for-profit industry and that our current system is highly corrupt and is quickly becoming unnecessary. The amount of $$$ that will be spent to go to college is rising while the amount of $$$ you will make after college is going down. The end result will be college costs too much to be a viable option.",1314302126

You can ship bug fixes and there's a tiny amount of title update space you can shove content into, but large amounts of content are meant to be deployed through paid DLC. In part, this is because MS pays for the bandwidth, but it's also because many of the vendors who use their platform would get angry since it would destroy the level playing field they've got going right now.<p>Part of the reason Sony gives you more freedom and control is that they do way less than Microsoft does. They charge you for bandwidth for the services they do offer (like demo downloads from the store), and you have to do a lot more of the work in terms of netcode and servers. Microsoft also runs XBox Live games/services behind a VPN while PSN stuff runs out on the open internet, so a PS3 game can hit a regular HTTP server but a 360 game can't.",1314302109

It's a real pain to be at a university without free (as in beer) overloading.<p>I had an enlightenment about a year ago and realized that being well-rounded is supremely important. As a citizen of the world I ought to understand more than the basics of economics, philosophy, biology, art, history, music, etc. On one hand, it allows you to appreciate all the hard work that other people do in these subjects. On the other hand, this knowledge helps you make educated decisions when your democracy presents them to you. It's not stupidity that hurts us as a society, its lack of knowledge. An easy way to get knowledge is at a University.<p>Personal enlightenment and politics aside, conversing with well rounded people is more satisfying for both parties because a well-rounded individual often can offer a more sophisticated and interesting opinion than someone with little background and little ability to make connections between disparate fields.

2926116,comment,2925292,2925978,5,0,w1ntermute,,,"> Reddit solved this problem, kind-of-sort-of, with subreddits. If all you care about is programming, visit the programming subreddit. Unfortunately, the comments on Reddit are extremely low-quality (even on /r/programming), so it's not actually worth visiting. But maybe this could save HN for a few more months.<p>I think there's a very simple solution to this problem.<p>First of all, I feel that Reddit has an excellent codebase - for example, it is much more feature-rich than Arc (HN's codebase). So I'd recommend using the Reddit codebase for a site that fixes these issues, but that's a minor concern and can always be changed later.<p>Now Quora has taken the approach of removing anonymity, which I feel isn't correct because it can stifle discussion. A better approach would be to simply charge a nominal fee (a few dollars per month) to enable posting, which would make it much easier to keep track of and ban trolls. Moreover, if the community were to grow large enough, this money might actually be useful in terms of maintenance costs, etc.<p>Of course, just like Quora, viewing the site should be possible for anyone. The aim should be to set a high enough standard for discourse that people are willing to pay requisite few dollars per month to access the site.<p>Edit: I don't know if this would be a good idea (haven't really thought about the repercussions), but perhaps adding a ""penalty fee"" to the next month's monthly fee if one accumulates a large number of downvotes would be another way of stopping trollish comments. And perhaps doing the opposite as well - reducing the monthly fee for users who generate a large amount of insightful discussion.",1314301193

I did many of the things that Dave suggested (BA in Math, very few required classes for that one), and definitely lived by that policy. A prime example was that I never took a class just because it was a pre-req for another class that I wanted to take. There were some really hard classes that I did not enjoy doing the work for, but I had signed up because they covered interesting topics, and for the most part I was glad to have completed them.<p>As I said, I pretty much followed Dave's advice on course selection, not because I didn't think CS was necessary, but because I didn't yet know I wanted to do development. There are some things I feel I missed (like learning how a computer actually works), but on the whole the most useful programming skills I've gained are ones I've learned on the job or hacking on my own projects in the middle of the night.",1314301167

On the one hand, given that he's a passionate scientist and educator, I take Clifford Stoll's opinion seriously when he says that he believes computers don't belong in classrooms. I think that the effects on developing brains of large amounts of time with computers is undeniable at this point. And, as an observer, I do not see that the greater and greater application of computers in classrooms is resulting in more intelligent students. (More informed, possibly.)<p>On the other hand, a very long time ago, I had a cousin who was visiting and was having trouble with some physics homework about the Doppler Effect. Being a proper nerd, I quickly whipped up a simple animation of an aircraft at varying speeds across the screen, with concentric circles at regular intervals. I thought I understood the Doppler Effect and sonic booms and all that; when I was done, and I saw it in action, I realized how poorly I'd actually understood what was going on.<p>So ... in the lower grades at least, I think there's a chance that computers could help with mathematical understanding. Younger students seem to have a lot of trouble with things like mathematical association and commutation, which seems to lead to a longtime discomfort with things like the mental math described in the article.

I am responsible for IT security for a large organization.<p>I don't have a CISSP, although most other ISO's I know do. I've worked in security for about six years. It's a real mixed bag. Some ISO's are just high-level managers, while others are much more hands-on and technical. I do have several SANS GIAC technical certifications, although I don't consider those better or worse than a CISSP. Certs are really just a requirement if you want to work in IT security.<p>Like all certs, the CISSP is not a good measure of practical knowledge. I've met hundreds of people who hold various certs and various degrees. And none of that really matters.<p>What matters is prior computing experience and interest. Have they coded? What languages? Do they have a real interest in general computing. Can they show code they have written? Do they have github accounts (or similar)? Have they been a sys admin or network admin? Do they know OS fundamentals (file systems, user accounts, IPSec, firewalls, logging, shell scripting, etc).<p>If you find someone who has that past computing experience and a keen interest in general computing, and who has a college degree (major doesn't matter) and who holds a CISSP or SANS GIAC certs, then they'll work out great. But you don't want to hire the guy or gal with an MBA and a CISSP who has never administered a system unless you're only looking for a manager and you have security analysts/engineers to do the heavy technical lifting.<p>And I think this is where the problem comes in. These kinds of people (MBAs with no experience) are hired, then when the sys admins and other technical staff meet them they are shocked and amazed at how little they know about general computing and wonder how on earth they're going to ""secure"" systems when they've never installed an OS or configured iptables/pf or brought up a SPAN interface on a Linux box running snort or sent a PGP encrypted email message. In these cases, you have to have analysts and engineers to do the actual work and the managers can do the policies/documentation/audits.<p>So it's important to be very clear on the technical requirements and expectations (if any) of the security positions. You don't want to find out later that your ""security guy"" doesn't know what a bit or byte is and has never heard of IPv6 and thinks it has something to do with car engines.<p>Just my experience.",1314300654

I can simply tell you the vibe is far far better and you get stimulated to take risk when you see people around you taking far more risks (in seattle you are more likely to encounter people who say job is fine, buy house,have kids,etc).

There should start to be someone who gets in trouble for that.""<p>I think it's right that startups will be acquired earlier and earlier, but that makes me wonder: might those earlier acquisitions (which sometimes decrease productivity to 1/13th what it was) sabotage the success of the startup either because once acquired the founders don't have to work as hard to keep their heads above water or because when not constrained by a tiny startup budget the founders won't worry as much about finding efficient ways to do things--which in the past made them better startups/companies?\n",1191546190

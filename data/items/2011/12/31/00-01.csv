3409659,comment,3409539,3409539,0,0,kijin,,,"> Samsung’s ad is unashamedly similar to your typical Apple ad.<p>The two ads seem to tell completely different stories. The Apple ad showcases how you can take pictures with your iPhone and instantly share it with others. The Samsung ad showcases the educational and home entertainment capabilities of the Galaxy Tab. Which is probably a good idea, since the ad seems to target South Korean parents who are famously obsessed with the educational qualities of everything they buy for their kids.<p>A link on the page leads to another thenextweb article [1] where the author claims that Samsung is ""taking leaves out of Apple's book"" by making ads like this. The article compares the Galaxy Tab ad in question with a previous Samsung ad in the South Korean market [2]. The other ad is indeed quite different from the new ad, and perhaps closer to what American viewers expect Asian ads to look like. Hot chick in scanty clothing doing cute things, etc.<p>But guess what, Samsung has been running family-oriented ads in the South Korean market for over a decade. The old ad with Yuna Kim was for young singles. The new ad is for families. It's not a copy of an Apple ad, it's just another in the series of ""IT can be family-friendly"" ads that Samsung has been doing all along. The only difference is that now they're using Western actors in a Korean ad.

You would be so cut off from the infrastructure you know and depend on, and so i'll-prepared for the alien culture you landed in, that your knowledge of the future would be useless.<p>But 1975? That is taking it too far. I was alive in 1975! It was different from today, but not so different that you couldn't figure it out.<p>Yeah, you might be hard pressed to build an iPhone. But do not underestimate the awesome power of hindsight. The great thing about hindsight is that you know which ideas are likely dead ends and which are likely to pay off. Just knowing, say, that mammalian cloning is physically possible would make it a lot easier to do. You know that if you keep trying the reward is out there.<p>I think a lot of web technology could have been built earlier if people had only known it was worth building.",1276921278

Then its another 30ms to get from the game server to the onlive server. Then its ??? 5ms ??? to get processed and converted to video. Then its 30ms to get sent from onlive to your desktop.<p>So thats 95ms as a best case scenario. More than likely, it would be closer to 200-250ms most of the time.<p>And that is under absolute ideal conditions. I remember I frequently got a ping of 50-80 when I played TF2- It was quite rare to get near 30.<p>Also, just thought I would mention that the frame rate has nothing to do with the latency.

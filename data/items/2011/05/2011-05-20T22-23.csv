First, I'm not sure why I got so many downvotes, I believe my response was quite civil and appropriate, my intention was to be helpful.<p>Clearly many people here do not view ""USAian"" as an offensive or derogatory term.  I'll try to explain why I believe it to be inappropriate and hope I can do so in a polite and effective enough manner to avoid more downvotes.<p>""USAian"" reads to me as someone who, under the guise of disambiguation, is intentionally being diminutive.  Very rarely does a situation occur in which ""American"" as a term for the people from the US actually result in confusion versus the entire continent.  It seems most likely that the speaker is using it to intentionally point out the unimportance of the USA to counter an implied American self-importance.<p>You're using a term for a group of people that they would never use for themselves, which is a strong indicator it may not be a desirable label.  Further, given common themes in current global culture, it is very easy for the term to be taken as an intentional insult, as if the speaker is ""putting them in their place"".<p>Whenever I see something like ""USAian"" I assume the speaker views Americans as self-centered, imperialistic, unworldly or similar and is using the term to intentionally remind the reader of the significance of the rest of the Americas, with the implication they need this reminding.<p>But, based on the responses, maybe I'm an outlier.  Hopefully the above clarified my original response.",1305932202
2569718,comment,2569253,2569614,2,0,wtallis,,,"The market share argument implicitly rejects the idea that OS X is significantly more secure than Windows, by saying that when OS X gets more popular, the amount of malware for OS X will catch up and be more comparable to the amount of Windows malware. It postulates that there must be some threshold level of market share that Macs must exceed before this happens.<p>The current fact that Mac malware is still rare puts a lower bound on that threshold. Whatever that number is, it is larger than the current Mac market share. It is also safe to assume that 50% is an upper bound on that threshold.<p>If you assume that OS X is not only as insecure as Windows, but significantly less secure than Windows, then the threshold should be lower, because fewer Macs should be needed to reach the same level of successful attacks. If an attack on Windows is twice as hard as an attack on OS X, then OS X should only need 33% market share in order to reach malware-volume parity.<p>Every advance in Windows security that is not matched by Apple, and every increase in Mac market share, narrows the conditions under which the market share argument can be considered true, and narrows the range of predictions that can be made in accordance with that theory.<p>While there is not enough evidence to totally reject the market share argument, we do not have the crucial evidence necessary to prove it true, and all the evidence that <i>has</i> been accumulating over the past decade counts against it.",1305932197

Big question is: where? For some things, the answer seems clear (sometimes after a couple of decades of experimentation). For example:<p>- there seems to be consensus that pluggable file systems are a good idea. But even there, there is no consensus on the interface, as shown by the VFS vs ZFS discussion.<p>- Pluggable printer drivers? I have never heard somebody argue that was a bad idea. On the other hand, there may be room for consolidation here, just as has happened on the terminal front (how many different terminal protocols are in active use?)<p>- Pluggable windowing systems? On Linux, it appears that X has won (for now).<p>For others, there is no agreement:<p>- Pluggable schedulers? At least a few years ago, there was disagreement about the question whether that was a good idea.<p>- Pluggable window managers? From what I read on the internet, these seem popular, but I think there is some selection bias there.<p>- Pluggable GUIs? I think that is a bad idea. You can build a system where, say, gnome apps and KDE apps and Java apps all look more or les the same, but I have never seen one where the Lego bricks did not shine through.<p>- Pluggable character sets (aka code pages)? Unicode has won that battle (because it is the best of all the abominations we can choose from :-))<p>In summary: I like flexibility, but I also think you cannot get a nice coherent system without limiting that. Designing is making choices. If I wanted to create a Linux system for the general public, I would probably have to sacrifice a lot of flexibility to get such a system in a reasonable timeframe.",1305931304

These effects had already been measured by other experiments and were found to agree with general relativity to much more accuracy than the GP-B measurements. What GP-B brought to the table was a direct measurement, as opposed to indirect measurements used by the other experiments.<p>However, because the way they measured it pushed the limits of engineering, if GP-B had NOT agreed with GR there is good chance the results would have been dismissed as most likely due to equipment flaws.<p>While it is in general a good idea to confirm measurements, especially using different techniques, in a case like this where the confirmation will be much less precise than the other experiments and will likely be rejected if it fails to confirm, you have to wonder why this was funded over other projects.<p>The answer to that turns out to be simple: politics. When space scientists ranked all the proposed missions under consideration, GP-B came in dead last. However, its proponents went to Congress, and got Congress to override the normal process for prioritizing missions, forcing NASA to move it to the front, ahead of more scientifically worthy missions.<p>There are a lot of very worthwhile scientific missions that we can't fly due to budget limitations.

But, the odds of outside developers joining a non-developer-centric project, without some sort of incentive, are slim. So, developer tools tend to attract a lot of help. End user applications rarely do (look at GNOME for an example; it's the most important piece of desktop Linux, and yet 90% of the code is being written and maintained by people who are employed full-time to work on said code; volunteers make up a tiny portion of the project).<p>There are other good reasons to develop software under an Open Source model. But developers working for free is not one of them in the majority of cases, and you'll probably spend more time herding cats than actually getting work done, if that were your primary goal.",1305929422

Something like node, python twisted/tornado or Go-lang. Same idea for databases.<p>Using the right stack will usually get you up to a few thousand users without major headaches, after that you'll have to know what you're doing.<p>There are startups that fail to scale to a few thousand users, who are easy enough to find for a free service. It's not a nice problem to have when you're not making money solving it. A little scalability planning ahead helps, gives you more time to work on the product.<p>The general advice on HN is to ignore scalability at first. It's vague advice to a vague question.",1305929402

It was kind of long so here's a tl;dr for anyone wondering about them.<p>The terms prohibit using the service for any illegal purposes including copyright infringement. They then waive any liability for damages but also state that doing this is prohibited in some jurisdictions so this might not apply. Then finally under Indemnification they state that a user agrees to be monetarily responsible for any liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorneys fees, that arise from misuse of the service.<p>The privacy policy states that personal information will only be shared with the consent of the user or if required by law.<p>The dmca page states that they will comply with requests but asks for them to be snail mailed to Hong Kong.<p>I wonder if there are any jurisdiction issues with them being located in Hong Kong. Maybe this was a carefully chosen location for legal reasons; does anybody know anything about this? My other initial thought after reading this is that they're going to have a hard time tracking down the users responsible for submitting torrents in some cases. I can submit a torrent for a movie while at a coffee shop using a fake email address, post the link online somewhere, and then go home and watch it. Then the only crime that I've provably committed is downloading copyrighted material which is less of an offense then uploading. If the site were to get sued for uploading while downloading the torrent then they have nobody to pass that blame on to.",1305929271

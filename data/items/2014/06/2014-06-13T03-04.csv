I&#x27;ve had a total of 7 sleep studies and multiple sleep latency tests (narcolepsy, cataplexy and mild apnea solved via a tonsillectomy), and I am constantly dismayed by how poor the space for optimizing sleep is. So much so, that I may seriously consider exploring the space in a year or two to find startup opportunities. Everybody sleeps and everybody would benefit from better quality sleep.",1402631897

7887367,comment,7887046,7887046,5,0,Eliezer,,,"My intuition would be that functional startups are visibly functional; they <i>feel</i> awesome.  If you have to ask whether your startup is dysfunctional, then the key fact is that it&#x27;s <i>not awesome</i> which I would expect---someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong---that your equity is substantially less likely than usual to be worth much.  Sure, there are non-awesome companies that succeed, but maybe they&#x27;re just the rare examples from the very wide pool of non-awesome companies, or maybe they have founders who were good or lucky at obtaining venture capital or had some other special advantage.  What&#x27;s your company&#x27;s special advantage?  Do you have enough equity, or enough pay, to make it worth more than all the other startups you could join can offer you?  Did you graduate from MIT or from Nowheresville college, and are they paying you $60K/year or $110K/year?

We understand the potential for influenza to mutate rapidly and since there&#x27;s no reason to believe the Spanish Flu was anything other than the result of this natural storm of mutations so we can conclude sooner or later influenza will hit the mutation jackpot again. We have to do everything possible to prepare for this in advance because once it hits there is precious little time left to save people. By most accounts the vast majority of deaths from the Spanish Flu occurred over a shockingly short period of about 12 weeks. Maybe modern public health standards can slow the next mutation down but I think we have to assume the worst is possible.

I have a couple of thoughts / suggestions for you.<p>I got the impression that the underlying motivation for writing the post, and tactic you used for justifying your positions was largely in response to what I would consider the overly myopic hacker news user base. That is, disproportionately white, male, curmudgeoney programmers. I sympathize with your frustration, but urge you not to let their world-view cloud yours, or cause you to search for complicated answers to simple questions.<p>An example of what I mean:<p>> I believe the current skepticism around Silicon Valley&#x27;s &quot;Make The World a Better Place&quot; mentality is deeply rooted in historical anxiety about institutional capitalism.<p>On this point, I urge you to consider a much simpler explanation: that people are skeptical because there is much to be skeptical of. People like Musk are a rare breed in Silicon Valley. Today&#x27;s tech &quot;entrepreneur&quot; rarely looks like Elon Musk, someone who genuinely seems to want to do good things for the world. The skeptisism exists because there are a lot of startups doing plain silly things, masked in global do-goodery marketing narrative.<p>Startups are the new gold rush, today&#x27;s investment banking. But the west coast has much different cultural norms towards opulent wealth than does the east coast. Put simply, we like to hide it out here, they like to flaunt it out there. Thus, &quot;we&#x27;re making the world a better place&quot; instead of something like <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>.<p>Still, I enjoyed your post and your choice of using macro-economic theory as a lens through which to view this.

7887320,comment,7886266,7886266,13,0,yomritoyj,,,"The author is seriously mistaken about game theory. The Nash Equilibrium requires every player to be maximizing their payoffs given what the other players are doing. But game theory itself does not say what the nature of the payoffs are: there is no problem in modelling altruistic players who attach a high payoff to outcomes which are good for everyone and low payoffs to outcomes which benefit only themselves.<p>The Pareto Optimal is not an outcome which is best for both, since the whole point of this concept is to avoid giving a definition of &quot;best for both&quot;. Rather it is an outcome from which no player can be made better off without making some other player worse off. So, for example, for two greedy people sharing a cake, any division of the cake, including one which gives the entire cake to one person, is Pareto optimal.<p>Anyone seriously interested in understanding what game theory really says and avoiding superficial mistakes in its interpretation should read at least the first chapter of Binmore&#x27;s &#x27;Playing for Real&#x27;.",1402630102

Yes, there&#x27;s a grab bag (but, in my opinion, not much more than that) of important technological innovations which have come from large companies, but so what? You still have corporations with large amounts of disposable cash for R&D in a world without monopolies and intellectual property. The handful of innovations you can mention don&#x27;t really have anything to do with monopoly or intellectual property, they just happen to have come from big companies - and there&#x27;s really no evidence that those companies would simply collapse by being slightly more cooperative.<p>The majority of important software innovations have come from the open bazaar, not the cathedral. The Internet; The Web; Firefox, WebKit; GNU/Linux, Unix; HTTP; SSH, SSL, AES; Python, Ruby, C, C++. Thousands of humble open source projects which have been distributed to and changed by millions of users.<p>And even when large corporations do spawn projects, those that succeed are those that encouraged at least some degree of openness. Android from Google, Java from Sun. Open standards for computer hardware architectures and software have lasted and stood the test of time.<p>Open code, projects, and standards have more than stood the test of time. We are actually living in a time of unprecedented open source success. The majority of computing systems run on significantly open source code. Millions of Android phones running Linux. Every serious server on the planet running on Apache or NGINX on Linux or BSD. A landslide percentage of users accessing them using Webkit, Blink, and Firefox. That&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg! Millions of lines of code are being updated publicly, in real time, by thousands of people across the world in collaboration. More so than ever before!<p>Sure, maybe <i>some people</i> are a bunch of VC-backed business-savy Steve Jobs-worshipping iPhone mobile app developers now, but it&#x27;s still sad to see someone say that tech innovation &quot;happens in periods of monopoly&quot; on <i>HackerNews</i>.",1402629938

In life, you don&#x27;t know the outcomes since the game has no end. So you <i>never</i> know if you&#x27;ve ultimately chosen the right solution.

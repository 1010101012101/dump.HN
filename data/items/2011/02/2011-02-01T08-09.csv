This is why the internet as we know it is doomed. There has been over the past 50 years a real push where we assume that private industry can solve anything. And now here is an example of someone who would actually go so far as to ""trust"" an industrial monopoly to continue to act in a competitive fashion. Why would it do that? That's not what monopolies do. They are uncompetitive.<p>No system is perfect, capitalism included. I know the libertarian brigade around here can have trouble sometimes wrapping their brains around this, but capitalism actually has structural flaws that need to be mitigated. The best way to do that we know of so far is by regulation enforced by a democratically elected government. This is a really simple concept and one that anyone 75 years ago would have intuitively understood.

Mayor Bloomberg and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announce first of its kind partnership to keep New York City at the cutting edge of technological innovation while saving taxpayer dollars.</i><p>Long term licensing of proprietary software somehow does not seem like the best way to save tax payer dollars. I wonder how many thousands of IT departments and millions of computers exist across federal, state, and local levels? It seems likely that either the Department of Energy, NSA, or DoD already maintains their own Linux or BSD distribution that could be used to run open office on every government computer in the country for free. Even if you are a Windows fan, it seems hard to justify spending tax dollars on that many licenses for government use.",1296548056

2164854,comment,2163228,2163851,0,0,eggnet,,,"You are describing peering arrangements between ISPs quite well.  The ISP that is sending the traffic will ""hot potato"" the packets to the closest peering port, so the ISP receiving the traffic is responsible for backhauling it.  This is why there is a convention of charging for traffic sent between tier 1's.  If it's a wash, then it's a wash.  Otherwise, whoever sends more pays more.<p>However, this is not how peering arrangements look between a CDN and an ISP.  In that case, the CDN is responsible for the backbone traversal, because the CDN is proxying requests or delivering them from cache, at the local peering point relative to the consumer.<p>In your example, if you are in boston accessing content with an origin in california, your ISP will receive the data in boston, and will not have to backhaul the traffic from california.  The CDN will take care of that.",1296547630

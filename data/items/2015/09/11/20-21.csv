Obviously so – there&#x27;s 60 years between here and there. The point is to compare the minimalist approach, and point out that there is precedent for it. There is no absolute, guaranteed, 100% &#x27;ideal&#x27; user interface, and it&#x27;s something that we are still working on – iterating on design is how we do that.<p><i>it becomes harder to separate interactive elements from non interactive ones and harder to tell &quot;on&quot; from &quot;off&quot; (I STILL can&#x27;t tell if iOS&#x27;s shift is on by looking at it). The desire to present information in a modern/minimalist way is at odds with this.</i><p>The iOS shift key is a good example of where this had failed  (and I do hope it is fixed). But here&#x27;s an alternative take – presenting information in a minimal fashion can help to draw attention to interactivity, rather than distract from it, thanks to the elimination of visual noise. The point is, it&#x27;s far from clear what the best approach is.<p><i>My personal opinion is that what you call &quot;wider design context&quot; is pure fashion. Yes, flat is fashionable, but it&#x27;s just not as good at the job of communicating the nature of UI elements to the user.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a case, or that such design can be called a &#x27;fad&#x27;. Design is still an evolving field – devices and the way we use them is changing, and design is no different. I won&#x27;t deny that there&#x27;s an element of fashion, in the sense that the popularity of design styles can influence other designers. But isn&#x27;t that equally explainable as a desire to avoid completely &#x27;off the wall&#x27; interfaces that will be unfamiliar to users?<p>FWIW, I don&#x27;t find flat interfaces to be an issue. Metro, for example, was simple and elegant, while allowing for useful approaches to clearly displaying and exploring information. And the iOS approach, though it has inconsistencies, actually makes a lot of sense, with the &#x27;content is king&#x27; and &#x27;depth through translucency&#x27; approaches. Most of the problems with the latter appear to be to do with the expression of state.",1442004953

I make a habit of whitelisting sites that I find valuable and don&#x27;t engage in sketchy advertising practices.  I even pay for Newsblur as my RSS reader so that I can pull the actual page up in the viewer and allow for the site to get my clicks.  The rules laid out in TFA would go a long way to easing my blocking even further, and when I used Ad Blocker I enabled the acceptable ads list.  In the past few years, though, I&#x27;ve also started to see advertising networks as potential malware threats and think advertising standards should incorporate security standards, as well.  When I go to a page that NoScript shows has 30 or 40 scripts with unrecognizable names, I&#x27;m less likely to go back to the site at all, much less whitelist any of the blocked domains.  If I was running an enterprise IT department, I&#x27;d be more likely to blacklist advertising domains than timewaster sites because of the threat of malicious payloads through those advertising networks.<p>TFA lays out ways to make advertising more humane for viewers, but I am curious how aware or involved with technical approaches like VRM or Kantara Initiative&#x27;s User-Managed Access (UMA) to making permission-based advertising more feasible.  In the past year I bought two new high ticket items--a new car and a new laptop.  I had to do two phase of research for each of them--what is even out there as far as features and then who offers the features I think are interesting.  I would expect that a highly qualified lead would have made any advertising much more lucrative during either of those phases (advertising that I would have actually welcomed) than a bunch of simple broadcast ad views (which I mostly blocked anyway).  I would love to see advertisers and browser developers work with groups like those to make advertising not just less obnoxious but something that I could actively consider useful.",1442004276

10206068,comment,10203842,10204312,0,0,briandear,,,"That isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s a law that insurance companies must have the money to pay claims. That&#x27;s what reinsurance protects insurance companies against. People don&#x27;t get paid because they didn&#x27;t suffer a covered loss. I was a catastrophe insurance adjuster for Farmers insurance during Katrina and Hurricane Ike and the unpaid damages where often for damages not caused by a covered event: for example a destroyed wooden floor with no evidence of roof leakage would often be denied unless they had Flood insurance. We also have massive amounts of attempted fraud. People attempting to claim full value on a roof that was 20 years old. The amount of fraud in the property insurance business amounts to literally billions. Also denied claims are easily challenged with a public adjuster. I had plenty of debates with public adjusters and there were time when I did legitimately underpay a claim. Damage estimating is a very inexact science. There are dozens of variables such as material cost fluctuations, damage area material cost gouging, contractor shortages they lead to out of state contractors coming in charging higher than the prevailing rate for a given piece of work. The meme that insurance companies are evil is simplistic. The amount of regulation in that industry is astounding. I had to get separate licenses in 18 states. A few other states has reciprocity agreements but generally I had to pass exams just to step foot in a state in any official capacity. I am definitely not referring to health companies though.. Can&#x27;t speak to that, but the property and casualty side of things isn&#x27;t as terrible as it&#x27;s anecdotally portrayed. During Ike, I wrote 12 checks per day which meant 16 hours a day on rooftops wading through debris and occasionally coming across human remains.

Stacked cards, the paper-layers-sliding-motion as you scroll down an app&#x27;s page in the Play Store on your Android, and especially shoving all your Chrome tabs (my friend [...has problems, ok, but still...] regularly rolls with >50 chrome tabs open on his phone) into the Recents switcher (and poor guy isn&#x27;t smart enough to figure out how to disable that feature in Chrome)...<p>anyways, my opinion is that tacit knowledge trumps nearly any level of design you can come up with. Users never look at the label or the picture of what they&#x27;re interacting with, they remember it&#x27;s spacial location in relation to the screen borders. For that reason, a good design should be chosen, and iteratively modified-- occasionally, but things should roughly always be in the same spot as before. This business of rewriting the entire presentation layer every year (Youtube app for example) is very mentally taxing and I have given up trying to learn how to use the new one. I suppose I&#x27;ll figure it out eventually, but I can more productively spend my energy learning a new language. It is, literally, too hard for me to relearn everything to care about figuring out whatever the hell their UX engineers most recently pulled out of their ass.<p>The thing that really, really angers me is I used to have a keen perception of how a fluid, clean, efficient UI behaved, but as I&#x27;ve been forced to interact with poor designs I&#x27;ve lost that talent.<p>It&#x27;s not just google, other products aren&#x27;t designed as well as they were when I was younger, either. About half of my suggestions for usability improvements in google apps (&#x27;Send Feedback&#x27;) have been implemented after I suggested them, and several within 2-4 weeks. This makes me cry at night. I had no idea what I had, and lost...<p>So anyways I basically don&#x27;t update any apps anymore (they&#x27;re always removing features or moving them anyways, why would I update if this one works fine?), and if I do and find the new interface too confusing I just track down an older APK online and make a mental note to never update that until I have the time and energy to learn the new layout.<p>bonus mentally-stimulating material: Windows XP&#x27;s Explorer (likely back from the NT->2k days, and probably entirely thanks to IBM&#x27;s role in NT development) had a great feature. You changed cursor focus in Windows Explorer with F6--but there were so many panes, so you would hold down F6 till you hit the one you want. Inevitably you were using List View, your hands were on the keyboard, and you were ready to start typing the name of the folder you wanted. The problem? There were so many panes that you&#x27;d always miss what you wanted due to the keyboard repeat rate. IBM&#x27;s (or some other hero at MS) solution? Focus goes to main folder List View pane, to Link bar (ctrl+F6) above the folder List View, and then <i>back</i> to the List View pane. But why? \n...because whoever made that decision knew that you were always going to miss it the first time, so they placed it twice so that you&#x27;d always hit it...genius...<p>As far as I can tell, these people don&#x27;t exist anymore.",1442003856

10205940,comment,10203953,10205874,0,0,AlexandrB,,,"> I think we saw the same process of design evolution with modern flat designs. There was certainly a perception among some designers that it was difficult to build modern interfaces in part due to the cruft which had been accumulated over the years. Look at an iOS 6 device, for example; even though it&#x27;s been only a few year, it looks utterly baroque to my eyes now.<p>It&#x27;s funny, the more time goes by the more I miss iOS 6 and company. Comparing flat UI design to Swiss design from the 50s is missing the obvious difference that minimal Swiss design was about presenting information, not creating an interactive interface.<p>As the linked article points out, discarding affordances has a very real cost to someone learning the interface - it becomes harder to separate interactive elements from non interactive ones and harder to tell &quot;on&quot; from &quot;off&quot; (I STILL can&#x27;t tell if iOS&#x27;s shift is on by looking at it [1]). The desire to <i>present</i> information in a modern/minimalist way is at odds with this.<p>My personal opinion is that what you call &quot;wider design context&quot; is pure fashion. Yes, flat is fashionable, but it&#x27;s just not as good at the job of communicating the <i>nature</i> of UI elements to the user.<p>[1] Edit: Just to add, Apple&#x27;s difficulty with making the state of the shift key obvious is a microcosm of this overall problem. The expressive power of flat design language is <i>so limited</i> that indicating the state of a single element is problematic despite several attempts. iOS 9 finally solves this by changing the case of <i>every letter on the keyboard</i> to make it obvious.",1442002727

When the block device is saturated and starts queuing, I guess one benefit would be that the block requests with the smallest waiting time would be served first, and improve responsiveness, but unless some kind of deadline is added you might have long tail where certain block requests don&#x27;t get to be serviced.<p>But since the paper assume there&#x27;s an opening time, perhaps then is not applicable for the block device example I gave above, maybe a more comparable example would be a traffic spike to a web application after some announcement, and how an http framework/library might &#x27;choose&#x27; http requests to service.

Lots of use of minimalism, bold colour, simple typography (Helvetica, even!). It&#x27;s remarkably similar in some senses; one of the reasons it became popular was because of the perception that design had become fussy and overburdened by ornamental detail.<p>I think we saw the same process of design evolution with modern flat designs. There was certainly a perception among some designers that it was difficult to build modern interfaces in part due to the cruft which had been accumulated over the years. Look at an iOS 6 device, for example; even though it&#x27;s been only a few year, it looks utterly baroque to my eyes now. Needless lines, textures, gradients and shadows that obviously served a functional purpose at one point, but with that purpose gradually diluted as the functionality and interaction patterns of software evolved. Building to modern requirements – with things like touch-oriented interfaces and responsive applications – can become much more complex with these constraints.<p>The thing is, design approaches will evolve over time. Designers, developers and UX folk will continue to tweak and adjust designs to offer a better experience. It&#x27;s not always going to be right, or even visually appealing, but it&#x27;s also a field that experiences constant change. Look at Google&#x27;s Material, for example – it&#x27;s not simply flat, but involves the use of animation, subtle gradients and shadows.",1442002017

Network equipment has supported IPv6 for a while, IPv6 does <i>not</i> break sites for IPv4-only users, and there&#x27;s no reason to believe that slow IPv6 tunnels are a significant problem.  The performance and reliability myths were entirely debunked by the highly successful World IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day in 2011 and 2012, which is why forward-thinking companies like Google and Facebook have permanently enabled IPv6.",1402883985

The majority of the people I know went to a public state school, aren&#x27;t abnormally intelligent, didn&#x27;t work abnormally hard, or do particularly well in school (2.5-3.5 GPAs), and all have little problems getting jobs paying 75k+ (only 25% are in software).

It&#x27;s a supply and demand problem.  If you get a degree with no demand, you shouldn&#x27;t expect to find employment.<p>In the past, the limit to economic growth was knowledge workers and a simple college degree guaranteed a middle class lifestyle.  Today, the limit is entrepreneurs and companies creating value.  We need to hold up guys like Elon Musk as heroes.  They&#x27;re the ones creating the jobs and industries of tomorrow.

As you know, ASU is a New American University uniquely committed to the simultaneous achievement of excellence, access and impact. As we move forward, we will continue to balance scholarship, discovery and the development of real world solutions on a grand scale, while remaining true to our vision of inclusion and student success. Institutions of higher learning have a responsibility to go beyond imagining change and instead bring workable answers to fruition. ASU has demonstrated its ability to do so successfully and we will maintain that trajectory.  On Monday, June 16, we introduce the world to the Starbucks College Achievement Plan.<p>The Starbucks College Achievement Plan is the combined vision of Arizona State University and one of the world’s most trusted, innovative and socially conscious companies. Together, we will offer leading education delivered online with world class faculty and personalized instruction to students who would like to continue their journey in higher education. This model is a unique partnership designed to increase access for more students to earn and finish a college degree, and is based on Starbucks’ and ASU’s shared values.<p>On June 16, we will join Starbucks as they host their first ever Partner Family Forum in the U.S. to announce the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with hundreds of their partners and family members in New York at the Times Center.  Watch the webcast on June 16 beginning at 7:45 a.m. PT, 10:45 a.m. ET by visiting starbucks.com/collegeplan. I also encourage you to watch the video of what this means to Starbucks partners by visiting starbucks.asu.edu.<p>The Starbucks College Achievement Plan is supportive of our vision to be measured not by who we exclude, but rather by who we include and how they succeed and moves toward our goal of enrolling 100,000 online and distance education degree seeking students.<p>This is a program we can all be proud of, and I look forward to your support as together we continue to increase access to world class higher education.<p>Michael M.

I have been working as a full-time ios developer for almost 2 years now and I still have to consult fuckingblocksyntax.com on a weekly basis. And fully understanding objective-c&#x27;s &quot;message passing&quot; idea is hard because it&#x27;s so radically different from other languages.<p>And sure you can whip together a simple app using all the documentation and tutorials out there for objective-c. But objective-c has a lot of gotchas that make it easy to do bad things as you start to build a larger app. Like retaining self implicitly because of an ivar in a block... Can&#x27;t tell you how many times that is bitten us.<p>That being said, have you tried to use Swift with the core foundation framework? Yikes. I spent hours yesterday trying to understand how to simply pass a pointer to a function. The type was something like CMutablePointer<Unmanaged<SecKey>?>. Hopefully it&#x27;ll get easier as the documentation improves though :)",1402880445

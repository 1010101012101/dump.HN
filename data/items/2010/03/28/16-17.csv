The limiting factor in doing this is likely the energy consumption (and in many other ways as well). \nThe cheapest energy source by far is the Sun, consequently we will need to build Dyson spheres, thus pushing us off the Earth. Once we are at that stage the only way to get more energy (to support further fidelity or population growth)  will be the other stars and similar mass concentrations, which will eventually lead to colonization of the galaxy and beyond to galaxy clusters/super clusters.

If there is anything to be called the Eternal, The Highest, God, etc, then true religion will get you right with it.<p>An ethics, or the most important part of one, relates a human being to <i>other human beings.</i>  If there are other human beings (there are!), then a true ethics will get you right with them.<p>This definition, which is more or less traditional, is broad enough to allow egoism, Hobbesianism, etc. as forms of ethics - so that it would be intelligible to say that one gets right with others by taking adequate advantage of them.<p>Your suggestion that ethics (or the part of it that relates people to each other) must be some form of religion is in fact a reductive claim about religion. But it also threatens to destroy the specific character of the ethical.<p>It entails, for example, that one person does not wrong another by, say, killing her or lying to him, but only ever wrongs God, or the Eternal or the Most High.  Killing someone on your account (supposing Christianity as the background religion) would not be formally different from, say, not going to church on Sunday; they're all just cases of going wrong by God.<p>Every human experience of grievance and anger at someone is a rejection of this nonsensical idea. The content of these passions is ""He done me wrong"", not ""He done God wrong"".  The distinction was always been maintained in classical theology.

I'm sure only half a dozen people through the United States were actually upset about Janet Jackson showing her breasts on television, but politicians around the country reacted with outrage. Fortunately this trend will be short lived.<p>In Scott Adams' book The Dilbert Future there is an anecdote about why all politicians seem to be crooks. The possible reasons he gives are<p>1. Crooks are the only ones who run for office<p>2. Politics turns people into criminals<p>3. All politicians are being framed<p>4. Every person on Earth is a crook, but only the only people we check out carefully are politicians<p>There is no reason to believe the first three are correct, so probably the best explanation for this phenomenon is reason four. Now clearly not everyone is really a crook, but it is true that we have all done both good and bad. The problem is that a scatter shot of everything that each person in the translucent generation has ever done is available online through a quick Google search. This is a great tool to find out if a potential employee has committed a felony. The problem is how should one react when reading logs of that person's online chats from when they were ten?<p>No matter how stupid, racist, offensive, or pathetic ones comments were as a ten year old it is unlikely that they would have a statistical correlation with job performance at age thirty. When everyone has dirt on everyone else, it won't be about the number of failures, it will be about—within reason—the number of successes. Instead of being judged on your gravitas, you will be judged on your ability to act appropriately in any given context.""<p>If I were to rewrite it today, I think I would add that reputation is more important today than in any other point in history, but that what constitutes good and bad karma is rapidly changing.",1269792951

I've done a bit of CL and, lately, Clojure hacking and I do think that learning Lisp is an enlightenment that no good programmer should deny himself.<p>However, I'm also less and less convinced that the one really killer feature that Lisp allows, macros, really makes up for the downsides of the s-expr syntax. Modern languages with closures and first-class functions and easy, powerful metaprogramming facilities give you enough flexibility without macros and history has shown that s-expr prefix notation is just not something that many people enjoy.<p>A previous poster's claim that Lisp makes a good extension language because it's scriptable is a good case in point. Dealing with the s-expr syntax in a capable editor like Emacs isn't a problem but entering complex, ad-hoc s-expr expressions on a command line is just gross. I'd <i>much</i> rather use something like Python or Ruby or Lua for that purpose.<p>I'm not sure that any of the existing statically typed, type inferencing languages have really found the sweet spot yet but, as much as I enjoy the current crop of dynamic languages, I'm still much more inclined to believe that the next step in the evolution of highly productive languages is going to involve reintroducing static typing in a less cumbersome way, not revisiting the Lisp paradigm in a new context.

Or, if the smarter company can figure out how to avoid the former, it can have higher profits (which attracts competitors).<p>Insurance companies like to make money.

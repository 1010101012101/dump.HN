Yaswi is probably just a wrapper to SWI-Prolog. There are a few of those, and I'm tempted to write one for Lua.<p>I think designing a Prolog-like language <i>primarily</i> for embedding, rather than wrapping a standalone Prolog, will have an interesting effect on the design though - Lua, for example, benefits tremendously from being able to leave certain issues to C. An embedded logic language could likewise focus on what it does best.<p>* Somebody is probably going to pop out of the woodwork and say that my impression of Perl is based on Perl 10 years ago. They're right, as that's roughly when I switched to Python. It'd be tough to convince me to switch back, though.

If they are getting well paid, happy with business and are honest about their own negative performance evaluation, I doubt if the problem is on their side, unless they were technically not upto the mark to begin with.<p>Even if thats the case, where they are lacking in technical competency, if I can afford, I would love to have such a honest team and would rather work with them to help them reach higher levels of performance. It can  result in an inspired and loyal team - please note, it is 'can' and not 'will'.<p>Even the best team will fail, if the system and expectations in which they work is not set up right. By 'system' I would also include, the goal setting, delegating of responsibilities, method of checking accountability, the method and tone of communications, etc.<p>I consider its the leader's personal responsibility that the 'system' is set up right and keeps getting fixed and mended when required.<p>Though I would prefer a non-telecommuting team as I think it has some strong inherent advantages, a successful telecommuting team is not impossible. I have been running a telecommuting team (programming team + testing/requirements team) for around 8 months and am very happy with the way they work. Now I don't even have to intervene, just tell them what feature to work on, and they coordinate with each other and get it done real fast. (Partly, luck is involved, was able to get some really good programming lead and testing lead)<p>But, there was this instance soon after the testing lead came in. There was this exchange of emails between him and the programming lead over some misunderstanding and they were going on back and forth on whom to blame between the two. I could foresee it screwing up rapport between them with long term ramifications for me, stepped in right away, took the blame for the misunderstanding ( I think I did have some responsibility for that), so that they can focus on fixing the problem and move forward. It worked.<p>A bit later, I wrote up and sent some philosophical crap to both, about all of us being imperfect and all the great things in the world getting built by imperfect people and systems. ( I do believe that crap though :) ). Its been more or less smooth sailing since.<p>If the problem is indeed with the people then firing may be a good solution. But if the system is the problem, you will be having the same problem again. So do check if the problem is with the system.<p>If you do have to resort to firing, try one at a time but for a definite and solid reason and communicate that reason to others. That single firing itself can bring about positive changes in thinking, actions and performance for the rest, provided the system was not the problem.<p>Mass or in-explained firings will bring down the morale and can also bring down your credibility with your remaining and new employees.

Your customer has a problem, it's lots of work to map that problem onto code, it's hard to explain to the customer just how much work it is to turn the ""simple"" activities performed by (say) their administrative assistant into algorithms, and the result tends to be expensive to document, deploy, and maintain. So, yeah, it's the problems that seem to be hard, not the ""programming"" -- though, in fact, there is no hard-and-fast distinction there.<p>But then there are problems in programming that are difficult to impossible, all by themselves.

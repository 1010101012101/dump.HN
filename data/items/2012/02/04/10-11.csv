3550794,comment,3548824,3550323,2,0,adgar,,,"> Git is used as a local cache for perforce where a branch roughly corresponds to a CL. Only subtrees of interest are checked out.<p>That's a common use for git at Google, but not the only one (I'm a SWE). When I do use perforce I've got enough rhythm that it doesn't get in my way, but I really like git at Google for local branches on rapidly-changing subtrees. A lot of time I'll work on a branch to submit as a CL, but then realize I should do something else that depends on it. Perforce is a mess at this situation if the tree is changing much, and git is perfect if you just make a new branch.",1328353108

3550779,comment,3550415,3550415,5,0,yason,,,"I wish MAFIAA would realize one day that I've never bought a cd, vhs, or dvd product (or a game or application, for that matter) simply because I couldn't have been able to copy it from somewhere.<p>Everytime I've bought something has been because I've realized that it's a good album, movie or game that I want to <i>own</i>. Emphasis here: I want to own the release. This means it doesn't matter if I can get it free because I want to buy it. It also means that subscriptions or DRM remove me from owning what I want to own. I pay for the ability to own what I bought, and for that only.<p>Now, getting to know what I want to own is a tricky question. I may have read a game review and known that I want to buy tht game. Perhaps a movie was made by someone I know makes good movies, and I know I want to own his next film. Or I hear music at my friend's place and decide that I want that album too. Or I ""pirate"" releases from a friend or Piratebay or usenet and realize hey this is good stuff, why don't I look up a collection box or greatest hits album somewhere.<p>However, what has changed is that I no longer want physical cds, dvds, or game boxes. I want what Piratebay offers: downloadable .avi files well-transcoded or flac files without DRM. And I want it easily, from the same unencumbered source instead of hunting for online music stores and trying to figure out if they offer what I want in the right format.<p>I wonder what happened if Piratebay offered a Pay button on top. You could, if you wanted, pay an amount you think it's worth for what ever downloads  you liked. There would be no minimum or set prices because you can get what you want for free anyway. The money would go to the production company or whoever owns the copyright to the song/film/game in question. It would be absolutely net-positive for the copyright owners because the worst that can happen is they get nothing which is exactly what they have now. If you have enough channels that people can use to pay you, a number of them actually will do that, because it's easy and people like to pay for what they want to own.",1328352382

Could you not archive it?<p>Or is the sheer number of files the problem, even ignoring history?<p>This is not a ""git is perfect, fix your workflow"" post, but I'm genuinely interested in what you have to say.

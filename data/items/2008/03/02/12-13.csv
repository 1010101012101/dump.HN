So PG's opinions/thoughts are not relevant here, since obviously this particular ""bored developer"" is straying from that view.  For example, PG said you don't even really need a good idea - just get started.  But this ""bored developer"" apparently can't start without the good idea, so he apparently is experiencing a different reality at the moment than PG.<p>Seriously what does my response to ""bored developer"" have to do whith what PG says/thinks/does/where he goes on vacation?  If PG writes an essay that says he thinks oxygen is useless and somebody next to you has an asthma attack, are you going to turn around to them and tell them, ""Well, didn't you read PG's latest essay where he tells you he thinks oxygen isn't that important?""",1204462798

127319,comment,127157,127201,0,0,NSX2,,,"I don't see how most of your post has anything to do with what this post is about.<p>This post is not about a ""pithy homily"".  It's not intended to ""inspire"" anybody with platitudes.  This is about understanding the underlying reality of what makes people care enough about your ""experiment"" to pay you money for it.<p>I was under the impression that people here were starting startups in the hope they they may one day become successful businesses.  To make that transition all the questions above need to be answered.  I thought that might be relevant to some people as being able to answer all those questions is something lots of startups, Y-related or not, have trouble answering.<p>> The point of a scrappy startup tends to be that of \n> experimentation, not a sophistacated execution of a great idea.<p>Well, that may be the point of <i>your</i> startup, but this post was for people who want their startups to be about good enough execution of an idea that paying customers think is great.<p>That translates into financial transaction which translates into a functional business.<p>Experimentation should be the points of students still in school, major corporations with money to support it, and people who are tinkering while having another source of income.  If you quit all that and ""dropped out"" of the system to start a business, well, the <i>only</i> point is to figure out how to start making money.  Especially over the next 4-5 years.<p>To the extent the tinkering strays away from that and becomes absorbed in itself for its own ends, you'll wind up with an interesting experiment, not a startup that becomes a business.<p>That's not me ""attacking"" the delicate egos of any programmers, that's cold, hard economic reality.  Whine if you wish but people still won't hand over their increasingly scarce money to you as long as you pout instead of figuring out how to answer all the above questions.",1204461455

So while a poll doesn't add a huge amount to the community, the way people upvote polls reflects this if and only if the polling is separate from the frontpage upvote.",1204461109
127317,comment,126981,127231,0,0,NSX2,,,"Okay, notice I'm saying ""great business"", not ""startup.""  There are millions of ""startups"" working on cool technical challenges, of which almost none will become great businesses.<p>When all those things you described were happening, almost nobody cared = no business.  When they turned to meet needs of a much broader audience then the few technical people who were interested in such a narrow range of issues, they took off as businesses.  In my mind, ""startup"" does not equal a business.  Business means lots of people pay you money for selling them your thing.  So to a limited extent, for example, Woz had a ""business"" selling computers through ads to computer enthusiasts in the back fo Scientific American or whatever.  But that was nowhere near as successful a business as when Jobs visited PARC and realized the research they were doing on GUIs based on the human mind could be significant for a lot of people.<p>The Yahoo folks may have started with a list specific to their interests, and students may have found it cool, but that was not a business. It became a business when they broadened to general idea of an organized list to the needs of a larger audience.<p>I've come across quite a few programmers over the last year who turned me down because they said they were busy working on their own startups, all of which were based on solving a problem only they seemed to care about.  They incorporated, had a ""company"", etc.<p>But that doesn't equal business.  Business means people pay you money.  For that to happen you have to broaden your considerations to what those people want, not what you care to/can build.  I won't, nor will anybody pay any of your startups a penny because somebody wrote really cool code that everyone on Hacker News agrees is awesome.  But I'll pay you money if your code solves my needs.  You don't care to solve my needs?  Fine. You may have a technically awesome thing.  I won't pay you for it, though.  And neither will anyone else.",1204460637

127315,comment,127234,127234,0,0,cawel,,,"Do we need a sophisticated theory to describe ""herd behavior""? And does it really challenge the ""efficient markets"" theory? I would say that an individual is making a _rational_ decision even if it is based on the behavior of others. I see that as valuable information before making a decision. If I understood it correctly, the author sees it as irrational.",1204460401

To your response:<p>1) I am not trying to say that he should have stayed in the country to begin with necessarily because his act could obviously be construed as treason and be silenced immediately if jailed. I was also not trying to suggest that he is not a hero to this country (because by many accounts, he is) but rather I was trying to suggest that a patriot does not abandon the country to which he claims patriotism [because that would be completely illogical].<p>Now, Snowden is a very public international figure. If he were jailed, people would be watching his case very closely.  Snowden&#x27;s situation is different from Bradley Manning&#x27;s because when a judgement is made, everyone will care because he did in fact give himself enough time to find refuge in another country and spread a full story and reveal himself to the world. He is now a popular culture figure for many countries.<p>However, the reason he invites claims of espionage is that he claims refuge in other countries. A patriot does not need to turn himself over to the government but must turn himself over to the people of the united states. By running he only makes himself appear more guilty in many people&#x27;s minds. And by running he also opens himself up to a lot of conjecture as to why he&#x27;s running.<p>2) The government is doing damage control by charging him. They have an unanswered opinion that can be broadcast to most of the country because he is fleeing (this old adage still applies to many people: An innocent man has nothing to hide). He is ruining his patriotic reputation by running from the country because he is giving everyone a chance to step back and insight any opinion they may about his patriotism, mental stability or really anything.<p>As a patriot I would agree he is justly afraid. But what I meant to suggest that by running, he is proving himself as a saboteur or spy to people who agree with many media streams and is leaving many things up to justifiable question.",1371988795

5927192,comment,5924160,5924160,2,0,iSloth,,,"Your problem is the countries network infrastructure not the physical location of the servers, for example here in the UK basically all websites will load quick, it&#x27;s hard to tell just from page load speeds if a server was located 10 miles down the road from me in the UK, or across the pond in the USA. However Haiti is closer to the USA than the UK, so it&#x27;s really not server location that makes the difference.<p>Building a server farm in Haiti isn&#x27;t really going to improve the speed of web services, what you would need to look at is getting better network infrastructure around the country and back to the main internet exchanges within the US.<p>Normally the problems you face here is the price of sub-sea cable bandwidth is greatly dependant on the economies of scale; they typically want massive investments to drive the prices down to reasonable levels. Then when you have the off-island bandwidth sorted you need to build faster local infrastructure to get this bandwidth to your users.<p>Once you have faster internet connections with decent global connectivity you will naturally start to see service providers build data centers out there.",1371988708

For the past 10 days we have been hearing non-stop reports of the infamous extradition process that will drag on for 10-15 years in HK, providing asylum to Snowden. Turns out a mere day after espionage case was filed Snowden is allowed to leave HK. Do you seriously believe Snowden thought, wow it was great living in HK for 10 days but now I need to go to Venezuela or Cuba (via Russia) since they are havens of freedom and human rights? Snowden put HK in a very tough position this is literally the best way they could get the US off their backs. The strong language in the press release is all show, look at what people do not what they say.",1371985962

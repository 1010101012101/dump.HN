It's such a relief that there was no nuance or complexity in history, now I won't have to do any of that nasty ""thinking"".<p>Sarcasm aside, you present an entirely simplistic view of history perfectly tailored to the point you're trying to make. The only people who are going to believe anything you're saying are the people who already agree with you, because people tend to be less than critical when it comes to their pet theories.<p>As a counter-point, here are some of those grey-suited company-men from the post-Teddy Roosevelt era:<p>Henry Ford<p>Alfred Sloan<p>Thomas Watson<p>Walt Disney<p>Will Kellogg<p>Warren Buffett<p>William Boeing<p>Gordon Moore<p>Henry Kaiser<p>There are more. So what exactly is your point? There were clearly self-made men after Roosevelt. Are you arguing that there were more self-made men before Roosevelt? I'd like to see some evidence to that. Or maybe you're arguing that the general ""sentiment"" was against self-made men. Again, I'd like to see evidence of that, and good luck finding it. First you'll have to define just what the national ""sentiment"" is, then find scientific studies of people both before and after Roosevelt that tried to discern it.",1293379134

Windows simply isn't natively compatible with what I need, and Ubuntu is a pain with consumer apps (Office, Adobe CS5, Mathematica, etc.) My cheap solution?

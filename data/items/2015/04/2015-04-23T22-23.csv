9430450,comment,9430259,9430259,0,0,brudgers,,,"Not getting paid sucks. Sorry to hear you&#x27;re dealing with it.<p>My advice, for what it&#x27;s worth, is if you have more productive things to do with your time than pursuing a lawsuit, then do those things instead of pursuing a lawsuit. And on future contracts:<p><pre><code>  :require a retainer to be applied against *final* invoice.
  :require payment to be due on receipt of invoice.
  :have the right to stop work immediately on nonpayment.
  :follow through on all those terms. 
</code></pre>
My heuristic is that complaints about fees before and during a project are a tell that people who dont intend to pay provide as a way of rationalizing nonpayment. Context of course matters, e.g. a person whose role is just negotiating and not paying is just doing their job and some people just like to wheel and deal. But generally, anyone who expresses a problem with writing me a check never owes me money...instead, I owe them work.<p>The tl;dr is manage the issue of payments during the honeymoon don&#x27;t wait for the divorce.<p>Good luck.",1429829931

9430448,comment,9423545,9426883,0,0,coliveira,,,"Types exist to help you organize your code. Const (for classes) just promotes the misguided idea that you should design objects with mutable and immutable parts at the same time. The main objection to this is that your objects should be either value objects (therefore immutable) or reference objects. There is no need for const if you design your classes in this way. On the other hand, the const idea requires you to spread &quot;const&quot; everywhere you might want immutability, otherwise the compiler will fight you at each line of your code. Either way, it is a loss-loss proposition.",1429829914

Yes, I am interested in that kind of thing.<p>Also a coincidence: me and my brother used to do cooperative 2-player speeed-runs of Doom/Doom2 as part of a thing called &quot;H2HMud&quot;. We had a setup which consisted of a fast 486, and a really slow 386. It ran <i>really slowly</i> - about 1/4 normal rate when you woke up a room full of entities. The 486, however, rendered every frame, which meant the person on the fast machine could happily pick every off pixel-perfect, while the slower machine player would do &quot;support&quot; stuff (flip switches).<p>I wondered what the &quot;limit&quot; would be if you could slow it down arbitrarily, and re-stitch, and I guess that&#x27;s what it looks like in the video you posted.

Every player&#x27;s host machine has identical state. That&#x27;s not as superficial as things like score, who is alive/dead, etc - it&#x27;s exact positions or all entities, their metadata... all the way down to <i>the next number to be picked by the random number generator</i>.<p>This is updated every tick (30Hz? can&#x27;t remember) and every machine needs to synchronize with every other within that tick, or the game <i>slows down</i>. If you&#x27;ve ever played Doom over a modem, you know what it&#x27;s like when someone has bad settings which result in high latency - in this case, poor frame rate. The data sent between machines consists of the <i>inputs</i> - e.g rotation, movement, fire, talk - and not higher level constructions such as motion vectors.<p>So it&#x27;s entirely necessary that the &quot;random&quot; number generator is not so random at all.

My biggest gripe with him is that he tends to conflate &quot;the world&quot; or &quot;the West&quot; with what often seems to be Paris and its environs, when you look at what he&#x27;s actually citing. But then again, that&#x27;s a complaint you can lob against many 20th century French historians.<p>On the other hand, he really is an excellent historian of ideas and of early modern science; maybe a little less empirically grounded than historians from the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; world like me might prefer, but you can&#x27;t deny the usefulness of his ideas. He&#x27;s also quite a good prose stylist in many passages, much more lively and original than the other names (like Derrida, who I find opaque and boring) with whom he&#x27;s often lumped together. His opening description of Las Meninas by Velazquez in The Order of Things is one of the passages that made me want to study what I do.<p>To get a little pedantic though (because I&#x27;m enjoying this discussion), more recent historians of violence and executions basically support the specific claim you call into question (that executions typically didn&#x27;t frighten early modern audiences). People like Edward Muir at Northwestern have done great original work in Italian archives to show just how different attitudes toward public violence were in the premodern world. [1] An execution was literally something you&#x27;d take your kids to and buy refreshments at, like a play. I don&#x27;t see the conflict between that claim, which is quite robust on an empirical level, and Foucault describing gory details that shock his modern audience - just because we find it frightening doesn&#x27;t mean our great-great-great-great-grandparents did.<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=zlULqJ70bDUC&q=executions#v=snippet&q=executions&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=zlULqJ70bDUC&q=executions#...</a>",1429827888

And this is how most of the world operates.<p>Programmers spend all of our day pointing out flaws in each others&#x27; work, we simply do not allow each other to be wrong and correct each other at every turn... this takes time to get used to when you&#x27;re starting out (or come from a non-tech background), and would drive most people crazy and bruise their fragile egos (If this behavior has ever accidentally bled into your non-tech social life, you know this <i>does</i> drive most people crazy).

Notice that after the Flash Crash, most prices came back to basically where they started within a few minutes.<p>At the micro level, the problem is uncertainty. The &quot;true&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; price of a security isn&#x27;t something you can just calculate: it&#x27;s uncertain and subject to change when new information is introduced into the system. So theoretically, when the price gets very far from the fair value, market makers should become more and more eager to trade, since they&#x27;ll make a large profit when the price comes back. But in practice, they never know whether the person on the other side of the trade is just panic-selling and moving the price farther from equilibrium, or if they know something the market maker doesn&#x27;t and are moving the price closer to a new equilibrium. As the price gets farther from its previous stable value, the probability that the counterparty is informed grows, and eventually no market maker is willing to trade and the market dissolves.<p>This failure mode is related to the &quot;Market for Lemons&quot; problem: asymmetric information causing a market breakdown (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons</a>).",1429827762

That it makes it easier for companies to find investments in some cases is a beneficial impact of this, not it&#x27;s main focus.<p>It is a particularly HN bias to think of the market as a place to go fund a company, but that is largely a by product for most people.

9430275,comment,9426422,9426422,0,0,bane,,,"Since I started taking photos in earnest during travels in late 2004, I&#x27;ve collected around 120k photos. I don&#x27;t really shoot very often, but when I do shoot, I take tons of photos. For example, on a 10 day trip to London, I took around 9,000 photos. I&#x27;m not a great photographer, but somewhere in that pile will be some great photos I&#x27;m pleased with.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be stuck with one software&#x27;s way of doing things, so here&#x27;s how I organize them:<p>- Each trip is organized in a folder with a sortable date down to the month and general placename: &quot;2014-05 London&quot;<p>- Inside that folder, at the end of every day of shooting, I dump all the photos into a folder with the name of the day of the trip: Day1, Day2, etc. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use the date for the day instead. It doesn&#x27;t really matter much.<p>- Since during the course of a day, I might shoot at several locations, inside each &quot;Day&quot; folder, I organize the photos by location of the shoot or a short description of the event I was shooting, &quot;Walking Around the Shard&quot;, &quot;Tate Modern&quot;, &quot;East Dulwich&quot; etc.<p>- I also use a couple different cameras, so inside each of those, I have a folder for each camera: Nikon, Lumix, etc.<p>- Inside each of those I separate out pictures I took of my family or of me with pictures of sites. I usually upload the &quot;personal&quot; pictures to Google or Facebook so I can access them anywhere.<p>- So if I want pictures of us from Picadilly circus on the 3rd day of our trip to London (and not the 6th day when we went there again), I go to 2014-05 London/Day 3/Picadilly Circus/Nikon/Us<p>- If I want Pictures of Bernini&#x27;s <i>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</i> from the Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, I go to 2011-04 Italy/Day 5/Rome - Santa Maria della Vittoria/Canon<p>- In each of these, I make a folder called &quot;top&quot; where I copy the photos I think are the best. As I process the photos I make a final selection and put the results in a folder called &quot;done&quot;.<p>- So the best, finished and processed, shots from my last example are 2011-04 Italy/Day 5/Rome - Santa Maria della Vittoria/Canon/top/done<p>out of maybe 200 photos total at that church, only 2 or 3 might make it to &quot;done&quot;.<p>Even if I can&#x27;t remember exactly which day I took a shot, the descriptive names are searchable in the file structure and I can usually find a specific photo in a few seconds. It&#x27;s also self documenting so when I need to update my CV or remember when I took a trip somewhere, just navigating the file system provides all that information.<p>There&#x27;s often 1 more step, an agency also buys some of my photos, and their acceptance process is even more stringent than mine, so out of 20 or 30 &quot;done&quot; photos, I might only get 6-10 accepted for professional publication. I put those in a &quot;published&quot; photo under &quot;done&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve started a new system as well. On January 1st, I take the previous year&#x27;s photos and put them in a folder with that year. Only the current year&#x27;s photos stay in my root photography folder. This makes things much tidier even if a little harder to find. So all of the above examples would have one more folder with just the 4 digit year before it.<p>I make a global backup of my entire collection after every trip or shoot onto a couple other disks, one of which stays disconnected most of the time and in a drawer.",1429827698

I do think that there is, generally speaking, a heartfelt desire to develop the tools and data needed to gain insights that Berman is talking about.<p>I think there are two challenges to unpack. One, though I wasn&#x27;t insinuating it, I could have been. I do believe that regulators are more lawyers than physicists. Berman is the exception rather than the rule.<p>Two, Berman, in particular, makes a fundamental error that I think is very easy to make. There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;complex&quot; in the sense that something has a lot of parts, and interactively complex in the sense that parts of a system are fundamentally unknowable and it can experience wild and unexpected dynamics. I think Berman doesn&#x27;t distinguish between those two types of systems (repeated analogies to cell phones give some indication of his thinking), and more generally, regulators don&#x27;t understand the aggregate cost of complexity.<p>In my view, things like Midas are orthogonal to some deeper issues facing the markets. Regulators have created a quasi-competitive market that breeds this sort of interactive complexity. Then, when something goes wrong, they rely on punishment and enforcement actions [1] to target individual firms that have made &quot;mistakes.&quot; This not only does not address root causes, it creates a culture of silence around technology risk issues within firms and across the industry.

The humanities are, collectively, our imperfect attempt to define a consensus of what happened, what it meant, and why a new perspective might be important (or at least interesting) to modern people. (And since humanities people are happy to trigger off of other humanities people, we wouldn&#x27;t even need any new events, history, or art to keep the machine going; it would just endlessly rehash it&#x27;s own interpretations endlessly.)",1429827257

We learned the lessons when developing our outboard motor battery pack, but the batteries we&#x27;re using are the same cells used in laptops, and the same chemistry as used in cellphones, tablets, etc.<p>There is no specific charge level at which battery use becomes costly. It&#x27;s just more costly to charge the higher the voltage to which you charge. Of course, overcharging (over the rated voltage) is extremely costly (and dangerous). Under that level, the device maker has to make an arbitrary choice about how to balance cycle life with calendar life, and that choice is usually near (but not at) top voltage.<p>Our tests have found that charging a cell to 80% instead of 90% can extend its life by more than 50% under the same conditions of use, sometimes much more (lots of factors: charge/discharge rates, temperature, time between cycles, etc.). I&#x27;m sure no cellphone/tablet maker is limiting charge to 80%.",1429827231

Socialism is also known to have very severe problems in application, particularly how to incentivize socialist managers to behave like capitalist ones in most circumstances, driving innovation and maximizing productivity. Socialist managers have somewhat different contstraints on them from capitalist managers, and nominally different long-term goals, but they are more similar than you might think.<p>The thing is: we know how to make capitalism work in a range of varieties, from the Scandanavian social democracies to the mess that&#x27;s Texas. We have never seen a successful system of public ownership of the means of production (which is what socialism is, and nothing else). It has been tried in a variety of places and times, and it has always run up against fundamental problems of managerial incentives and political corruption at levels that make most capitalist political economies look pretty good (which is saying something!)<p>So looking for non-socialist means of distributing wealth in a society that is unequally post-scarce is a good idea. Today wealth is distributed almost exclusively through paid work, but that is a relatively recent invention. I&#x27;m not suggesting a return to feudalism or anything like it, but think we should be willing to consider variations in social order that are at least that large-scale, because the difference between what is coming and industrial capitalism is going to be at least as big as the difference between industrial capitalism and the semi-feudal societies that preceded it in many places.",1429826542

It reminds me of the story of Eleanor Longden [1], a psychological researcher who has heard voices for years and has come to learn to live with them. &quot;Mental illness/health&quot; is a powerful meme that isn&#x27;t always for the best.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/08/ted-talk-eleanor-longden-schizophrenia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/08/ted-talk-e...</a>",1429826493

The wording wasn&#x27;t clear to me even though I reread it a couple times.<p>Though people <i>do</i> talk about their experience on phone screens so that gives an indication of their age.

Probably when you&#x27;re younger newer things seem more established than when you&#x27;re older and looking at a longer time horizon.   No offense meant to haskell.  :-)",1429826434

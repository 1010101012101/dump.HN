If these state actors were sufficiently powerful, couldn&#x27;t they instead press ahead anyway with obtaining the developer&#x27;s private keys, account data, etc., while publicly parading either the real developer (or an actor) in front of the spotlight briefly enough to claim that this was all a mistake? Next, release another series of new versions (with backdoors) that are fully controlled by the state actor under the guise that they&#x27;re perfectly okay.<p>Of course, this would itself be easily defeated by either examining the history of the individual who claims to be the developer (if applicable) and through some scrutiny of the new binaries, although I&#x27;d imagine the latter would be anticipated by the actors behind the charade.<p>The closest thing in my mind that this resembles is a warrant canary as someone else pointed out earlier today. I suppose that in effect the DMS and canary achieve roughly the same goal so perhaps I&#x27;m just splitting hairs at this point.

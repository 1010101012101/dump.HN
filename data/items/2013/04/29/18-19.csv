It comes up a lot in back of the envelope type debates about overall system / stage design and performance.  Note that 6% of the way to orbit sounds pitiful for a first stage but it actually has a pretty big effect on available payload and nozzle design of the second stage and reusability of the first stage and all that.  SSTO is tough, but sticking something close to a SSTO on top of a 666 booster helps a surprising amount.<p>On the other hand in aerospace its unusual to bolt the first prototype together then just punch it and see what happens, like a drag racer driver.

You'll have a cleaner, crisper picture looking through the eyepiece<p>- Most cameras tend to have a refresh rate which is laggy.<p>- Eyepiece optics tend to have a wider field of view, making it a lot easier to find interesting areas to focus on<p>- Especially for fluorescence, using the eyepiece helps block out background light, letting you focus on faint details.  Some details are just really hard to make out on the computer screen, without fiddling with contrast/brightness settings<p>- You may have the computer settings at a particular level where ""browsing"" the field is impossible.  E.g. your ""picture taking mode"" is set to long exposures, or very quick exposures with high contrast.  These settings make it difficult to actually use the computer for anything except taking the picture.<p>- You are taking pictures in fluorescence, but selecting/focusing with bright-field.",1367260881

You could easily write assembly code that maps directly onto JS semantics:<p><pre><code>        ;;; invoke getContext(""2d"") on the canvas object\n        .data\n    sgetContext: .asciz ""getContext""\n    s2d: .asciz ""2d""\n        .text\n        mov $sgetContext, %eax\n        call GetProp\n        mov $s2d, %edx\n        call InvokeMethod\n</code></pre>\nThat's more code to write and read, but only by a linear factor.

I've used Android for years (SGS2 and Nexus 7) and many of the apps are poorly designed and have even poorer implementations.  Many of them feel like they are just 5 standard UI widgets put together on the screen is just bland.  This can be seen by how many Android applications use Holo but don't try to give it their own personality.  Small changes to the UI can lead to a personalized and tailored/polished feel (Starbuck's green standard navbar, Netflix's logo on their own red navbar, etc).  Also, iOS apps seem to experiment more with gestures and UX concepts.  Using apps like Clear, Google Maps, Haze, etc. really shows you how well thought out an app could be.  It just seems like many of Android's apps look the exact same and lack that attention to detail, I guess.<p>Also, please remember that ""more powerful"" doesn't correlate to ""best.""  I would rate Clear much, much higher than most Android apps.

I'm not sure those early year numbers are quite spot on.<p>2) The initial offers are set for the middle of the L59 compensation range/band. As those bands went up, so did all of the others - I guarantee the L59 band is not above the L60 band. If you got hired in 2006, you're at least L62 by six years later (or you would have been managed out, in any non-disfunctional org). Even if you'd been camping and never made L63 (which is a big bump), you would get raises as the midpoint for the band moved over the years. Otherwise, it raises very serious issues with your group's HR generalist about why you have a L62 who's being paid outside (below or above) the acceptable range around the salary band and the manager would have been encouraged to either motivate or manage out the employee, if they really didn't deserve raises to take them back into the correct compensation range.<p>Microsoft is disfunctional about many things, but the HR generalists were pretty good at tracking and running numbers and asking very hard questions about people who were over/under-compensated or stagnating at a low level (sub-L63).",1367259484

Solve problems, figure out solutions, self teach continuously and knows how to use google search with a proven successful track record?<p>Or are you looking for a Redhat admin who uses mac minis and codes sysadmin stuff in python and uses puppet for systems administration and the play framework under Java?<p>I'm not looking for work, I'm cool where I'm at.  Under criteria #1 I'd be be your dream candidate.  Under criteria #2 I, along with 99.999999% of the tech population, would never make it past the HR filter...<p>Lets see I've only got 15 years experience with Debian of which 11 is a Debian Developer, you and I know I could figure out Redhat almost instantly but HR will filter me out by keyword.  I shut off my last mac mini last month although my wife still has one intel one running so that's probably not going to make my resume, you and I know that's not a huge issue but HR will filter me out for not having current mac experience (last booted 2 months ago or so).  I mostly code little sysadmin scripts in Perl (CPAN, really) or just shell script and you and I know that a guy who understands Perl, Ruby, C, and a couple other languages will figure out how to use the tab key and a couple google searches later I'll be productive in python, but HR will filter me out.  Shockingly enough we both use puppet so we'll get along famously and HR won't filter me out, at least for that, unless they do something stupid like filter on version number, I'm using 2.7 here at work so if you're still using 2.6 I'll get filtered out by HR.  I've been fooling around with the Play framework but I've been using Scala, really as a tool to learn Scala, that and project euler puzzles in Scala, so you and I know that someone who knows Play can probably transition from Scala to Java with little effort, but HR will surely filter me out.  By criteria #2 in this paragraph I'd be amazed if you find even one fully qualified applicant in the entire world, as you claim is happening.<p>At my current job while talking to tech people I can say that any middle to high end LAMP jack of all trades guy with some DBA and some systems analyst background could do the majority of it, and/or figure out the rest on their own if they are smart and have google handy, just like I did.  But you know HR would describe my job as an insane laundry list that virtually no human being in the world other than myself actually simultaneously knows.<p>Or you might have pay issues.  I don't live in a sand state so I don't make much compared to SV or Manhattan, but depending on if you use suburb, county, or state income I'm making somewhere around 90th to 95th percentile family income and expect to continue to be rewarded at a similar level.  I talked to an employer in Mountain View who offered substantially more money, unfortunately not enough as that would literally mean moving my family from a (small) landed estate in the 2nd wealthiest suburb in the region to, unfortunately, something like chef boyardee every day in a cardboard box under an overpass in silicon valley.  So its possible you might have salary issues.  If no one applies maybe you're offering $15K for a $150K job.  There's a local network admin position that hasn't been filled for years advertising $60K for a CCIE, which means they're paying a H1B $50K/yr and using the non-response to the ad to ""prove"" they have to import.  That doesn't mean there's a shortage of network administrators in the area.",1367259345

EA isn't good enough at step 1, and while they haven't screwed ME over, there are too many people crying and screaming for me to ignore it.<p>Who else could diversify the digital-distro ecosystem?

No matter how we improve it, in the end, programming is just instructing a machine how to conduct itself. Which is an activity that attracts only a few people who are intrinsically fascinated by that, and some others that learn the craft because it is good for its money.\nWe can improve the state of programming to make it more fun or easier to learn or understand, but whether you are writing a process scheduler or programming LEGO Mindstorms, the activity in itself doesn't change. You are still interacting with machines, not humans, you are mastering a creative process, which doesn't always sit well with working as a team, and the end result of your work is machine behaviour.

There is an inherent risk that comes with using them; that risk is so high (comparative to other every-day activities) that we have megalo-insurance companies covering them and laws demanding we wear seat belts.<p>I'm uncomfortable with agreeing with this analogy, because it implies that, where seat belts address the risk of operating a car, these bulletproof backpacks address an <i>everyday</i> risk of being shot while attending school.<p>I'm not versed in statistics on either; my uneducated gut says that the risk of getting in a car crash is huge compared to the risk of being shot in a school. If I'm wrong, that's troubling, terribly so.<p>I get the need to address fears in every way possible, but I think calling these products ""no different than seat belts"" is possibly maximizing fear where it's not necessary.",1367258708

The common sentiment here seems to be that there's a shortage of highly talented developers. If this is true, then their salaries may in fact be rising at a higher pace.<p><i>""Starting salaries for an entry-level software developer (with a bachelor's in CS) are roughly double the starting salaries for non-programmer entry-level positions that require a bachelor's degree--and employers don't like that.""</i><p>That's also true, but it's also interesting to consider from the perspective of a talented student considering CS. If he believes everything he reads, (a) he'll start with a decent salary but probably hit a glass ceiling relatively quickly (a much lower ceiling than, say, a doctor or management consultant or trader), (b) his skill set is in constant danger of becoming outdated due to the unusually high pace of skill turnover, at which point he'll be replaced by an H-1B holder or new CS grad, (c) he'll be expected to move to Silicon Valley (or NYC, apparently) where the cost of living will negate his higher salary. If any of these things actually come to pass, the relatively high starting salary he made the first few years out of school won't be much consolation.",1367258401

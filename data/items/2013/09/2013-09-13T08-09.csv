It is a fundamental flaw in the way food calories are measured. To measure the calories of food you put the food in a sealed container under a vial of water and burn it, the food has 1 calorie for ever degree centigrade it made a liter of water rise. ethanol obviously burns extremely well so by this test it has high caloric content but that does not mean your body can convert ethanol to fat, sugar, ATP or anything else useful to the body.

I&#x27;ve yet to meet an octopus I can&#x27;t convince to play with me for a while, for the cost of an Australian gold coin or two.<p>Another thing that I love about these creatures is that they are intensely playful.  I once watched an octopus playing with the sandfish around his hole .. he dangled an old crayfish head, long since hollowed out, at the end of a long string-like tentacle, luring the stupid little fish into his lair .. I watched him for hours, just lazily casting it out, bringing it back .. it didn&#x27;t seem like he was fishing (although he&#x27;d have been quite capable of it) but more like just entertaining himself by watching the stupid little fish fall for the trick, over and over again ..<p>Lovely creatures.  Be nice to them, you might make a reef friend.  (Watch out for the blue-rings, though, you don&#x27;t want to play with them too much, heh heh..)",1379062359

This is easy to set up (using their email as user id, and the internal cms includes that in the form submission) and doesn't require any additional services, just using the https connection that's already there.<p>On the other hand, you could do some AD integration. Not sure about the specific details here, but it could be a more solid, secure solution. More work would be required for this.\nThis would also provide for easier maintenance of user accounts (adding/removing users).<p>I'm sure there are several solutions in between.

But, he says, the job most students are really trying to get done ""is pass their courses without having to read the textbook at all"". These companies were trying to help students do something that they were trying <i>not</i> to do. He imagines a hypothetical ""cram.com"" would be more successful.<p>Most people (not all) find self-study extraordinarily hard - how many things have you, dear reader, set out to study but not completed? I think the only ones I have managed are when I'm using a textbook to help me achieve something specific - write some code, build a business,  solve some problem. I wonder, is this really ""study"" or just ""use of references""? e.g. Looking a word up in a dictionary is not really ""study"", to comprehensively master a topic.<p>It would be incredibly disruptive if someone found a way to make study - giving useful skills - enjoyable and easy.

Of course this could be purely be down to signalling effect, but if so it would imply signalling has as strong impact across all industries not just a handful of professional ones.",1302516921

MS wants marketshare, Google wants marketshare, faster internet for everyone is just a means to an end: more people using Google services. I'm sorry for not buying into the Google-hype, but keep in mind they're a business like everyone else and they are in it to make money. If you ever need proof that Google is doing this for money like everyone else, just take a look at the history of their advertising services.",1302516871

Suppose someone blind has never touched a cube. However, he knows that a cube is an object with 6 sides of equal dimensions and 8 corners. Then his blindness is suddenly cured. If he sees a cube would he be able to associate it with the description of a cube that's already in his head?",1302516795

As soon as Apple could, they dropped DRM on iTunes audio files by switching to iTunes Plus (and before that, you could burn the songs to a CD and import it back).<p>You'll find a quite different story when Palm made the Pre compatible with iTunes through reverse engineering.

The thing is, that people who don't hire people usually don't understand, is that programming experience that organizations are interested in is only experience of programming to external requirements under external constraints, because that is what working programmers do, e.g. ""write a program to do X on system Y by time Z"", where none of those things are what you would have chosen yourself.

They lost their design mojo - anyone else here remember the dark days of all of the performas, and quadros and powermacs with impenetrable model numbers after the names?  Beige boxes without any style running an increasingly creaky OS.<p>Jobs returned in 1997, and immediately the design chops came back, and the Mac's marketshare has been steadily climbing ever since, until today the Mac has enough presence in the US market that the platform is once again well supported by software and hardware vendors.<p>This time around, with the battle between iOS and Android, Apple is not as likely to drop the ball, like they did in the late 80s, early 90s.  The end result, in my opinion, will be a market with two dominant platforms.  Over time I would expect Android to become the budget choice with Apple picking off the high margin segment of the market. Indeed, this is the current market configuration that we see in the PC / Mac market.<p>Of course, the day is coming when Steve Jobs will no longer be at the helm of Apple.  I would hope that the board has understood the lesson from the first Jobs-less period, by choosing a successor that understands the primacy of design for Apple.",1302516121

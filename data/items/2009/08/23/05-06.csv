Many of them would just not work ideally, unless it were some open (as opposed to retracting into the device) system to just wind the cable around - and at that point, it is just marginally neater than wrapping the cable around the iPod in the first place.",1251006970

The main way you want to use these techniques is to show that a simple algorithm fueled by some bit supply of randomness (at least at the first time step to initialize some protocol variable) will then at some point in time hit a ``good''  state with high probability, and then you want to show that this convergence happens very quickly. Off the top of my head, i can't think of any slick examples, but if you want to do clever algorithmic hacking, this is the sort of math to know!",1251005431

The most notable fact about that company was that every single employee had a different version of what their product was actually doing. It was really bizarre. They had substantial funding, they had a brand, they were marketing the product and even managed to sell it, but every time they tried to explain the technical side of things it came out trivial. Don't know if they are still in business, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are.",1251005299

780225,comment,779505,780216,0,0,ghshephard,,,"If Facebook thought there was value, then $5mm for the company + founders, particularly in a stock deal, wouldn't have caused Facebook to make a decision not to buy.<p>The reality is that Facebook has a fairly large engineering contingent, and that writing a tipping application for the Facebook platform, will likely be a ""from scratch"" exercise - so there is little value in the codebase IP from TipJoy.<p>The actual architecture/algorithms associated with a tipping application are probably not so complex as to make Facebook believe they needed to purchase a company to get that knowledge.  TipJoy has no patents that I could find on online tipping.  And, Facebook wants to leverage its own social network - TipJoy just never really established enough momentum to develop their network and traffic volume to the point at which other organizations saw value that they wanted to acquire.<p>But, with all that said - it's true that _one_ of the reasons why Companies will purchase other companies is to acquire their engineering staff in one fell swoop.  In the case of TipJoy, their small size worked against them.  There wasn't much of an engineering staff to be acquired.<p>At the end of the day, this story probably repeats itself more often than you would imagine - as PG implied when he noted there are other YC alumni working at FaceBook - the only reason we're noticing it right now is that TipJoy is relatively high profile, and it became public knowledge that at least one of the founders is now working there soon after the startup shut down.",1251005071

780222,comment,780124,780136,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I agree. The law is really just reflecting unwritten rules already adhered to there.<p>I disagree that legalization would bankrupt the cartels. While a good portion of their operations involve non-essential tasks like smuggling, transportation, and security (and bribes, I suppose), the cartels are in the best position to capitalize on legalization. They have the growing and refining operations down on a scale large enough to support the (supposed) increased demand due to legalization. The smuggling portion of their costs will be substituted with marketing and supply chain management costs.",1251004795

I am not asserting that (a) and (c) are directly connected. It is perfectly possible that the people who looked at the acquisitions aren't the same ones who made the hire and the two sets of people may not even have talked to each other.<p>However the one thing no one outside Facebook can <i>really</i> know is <i>why</i> they passed on the acquisition. My reasonable guess is that they figured it would be cheaper to hire (<i>some</i>, not necessarily the same) developers and do it themselves. Are you asserting that it is outside the realm of possibility for them to have thought that way? Or that future acquirers, facing similar choices, would not calculate that it would be cheaper to hire developers after they run out of money?",1251003823

The problem is that <i>random phrases are emphasized for no reason</i>.  Is his readership so dumb that they won't be able to extract the main ideas from his article with them being <i>in bold</i>?<p>Anyway, it really annoys me.  I wish Steve Yegge would blog more often and drown Atwood out :)",1235134555

You must write test code for your test code before you can write your test code.<p>Test code for test code is code. You must write test code for your test code for your test code before you can write your test code for your test code.<p>TDD is trapped in a loop of infinite regression.  This means that TDD never produces actual application code.  In fact, it can't even produce test code.  How do you define a test of a test of a test .... of a test ... of a test ..... so you can write it?  You can't define it so you can't write it.  You have no starting point.<p>The answer must be that you really cannot do TDD.  You just call it TDD.  At some level you rely on the old standby of clean simple design, incremental implementation, inspection, and manual testing.  Why not cut to the chase and do that on your application code?",1235133395

488607,comment,487686,488481,0,0,mileszs,,,"That was completely unnecessary.  Never did he mention ""marketing asshats"" exercising some amount of control over any git developer.  He mentioned that GitHub acts as free marketing for git.  For git users, git getting increased attention is a benefit.  More projects using git is a benefit.  More hackers hacking on git is a benefit.  More tools built around git is a benefit.<p>Your anger is grossly misplaced, and really lacks any use in this conversation.",1235133070

Personally I can't really stand them, for most of the reasons mentioned elsewhere in this thread. The only excuse for them that I could see would be that they'd be easier to put together than a well-written article with appropriate code clippings and images, but I'm skeptical of that.",1235132445

Interesting to see that the individual productivity of the other team members was affected less than 2% each, which suggests that the larger the group, the less effect the ""bad apple"" has - it's not the case that the behaviour spreads out of proportion.",1235131696

Instruments have served as adequate ""observers"" for some time now as far as I know, so I don't think there are any philosophical implications to having a human observer as opposed to any other kind of observer.",1235131298

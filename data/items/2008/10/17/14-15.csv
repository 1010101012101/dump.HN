It's definitely comparing apples to oranges, and thus this article can't really be said to speak to freemium MMOs. The market is different, the products are different, just about everything is different. I am wondering if anyone has done any in-depth research about MMO business models; working for an MMO company, it's obviously something I'm very interested in.<p>Most 'freemium' MMOs are Korean. I don't mean to make a generalization, but is the Korean gaming culture much more serious than the US/EU one, and thus this model is much more successful in Korea? Many (if not all) of these Korean MMOs are available in the US, but I have no idea if the nonpaying/paying gamer ratio is better or worse, and those figures might unfortunately be private.",1224254038

This mostly isn't even due to the protocol itself but in the way that torrent sites tend to present the torrents chronologically.<p>Plus there is no bandwidth wasted on sharing content other than what you are interested in. Almost every other client wants to make you share all kinds of other stuff to even use the network: emule, freenet, tor, i2p, gnutella, etc.<p>Finally, pure luck has allowed the laws to progress in a way that hasn't resulted in the immediate shutdown or blocking of popular torrent sites. It should be noted that in certain countries this isn't the case and bittorrent has been a total failure there.<p>Also, on the majority of American college campuses today, bittorrent is a huge failure because it is easily fingerprinted and will get you banned from the network. Maybe they have finally added some stenography to protect against this but not that I know of. Then, there are the large ISPs that are degrading or blocking bittorrent now.<p>Of course, everyone knows that the real reason bittorrent beat freenet is because bittorrent was python and freenet was a big steaming pile of java:)",1224252798

So if your business requires the network effect (ie, any social network, etc) then losing those users makes your product less useful to people on an exponential scale.<p>The fact is, I don't think its a business model either. Its more like large scale marketing.

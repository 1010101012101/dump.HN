It's certainly the case for start-ups that smaller is better. Smaller is more nimble, more creative, less politics-driven, and forced to focus on what matters (because you can't afford anything else).<p>I'd say a team of 2-4 technical founders/early employees is ideal, though it's certainly possible to do it with just 1. More than that and you'll spend more time managing staff that building things.<p>Of course, it all depends on what you're building, too. However, to reduce your lead time, reducing the team size is a good thing for start-ups.",1254307486

852149,comment,851315,851315,0,0,yardie,,,"As a high school and college graduate I've got to chip in say this is gunk. The author was motivated and ready to go to college. There are a lot of motivated high school students as well. They've navigated the curriculum successfully and got out unscathed.<p>I've talked to college admissions officials on this. Like so many before me, I was smart and ready to jump off the carousel. Fortunately, someone steeped in the game stopped me before I made a pretty bad decision. I could have dropped out, got my GED and started to apply to universities. And I would have been summarily rejected from the good ones.<p>Instead I stayed, finished up all my highschool requirements by sophomore year (and most were done by freshman year). Leaving me 2 years to take college prep, AP, and dual enrollment courses. All of this was done on the school board's dime.<p>The blogger speaks about the author like everyone has the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, enroll at an American University, and do extensive travel. Unless something changed, AU is seriously expensive and is usually full of the countries' elite. Having access to money buys you tons of things. One of them being a good education anywhere.<p>Highschool may have its failings but atleast everyone is given the opportunity to go. At this point, you're old enough to make choices and young enough not to feel the consequences. I always hear of how bored people were when in highschool. I rarely hear of anyone saying I took it up a notch and took the harder classes.<p>I was awed when I set foot on campus. I met people that were much smarter and much more accomplished than me. At home I was a a local hero for getting into a good uni. Now I was in a class of local heroes. Some did major scientific work (Intel, Westinghouse, ISF, etc.) before arriving. And others started their first dotcom while in highschool.<p>While I understand the idea of unschooling, I'm not impressed with the attacks on the public high school. I'm equally unimpressed with attacks on homeschooling. Both require motivation, and homeschooling requires a bit of sacrifice. I have friends that were homeschooled. None were socially awkward, naive, nor ignorant. They understood that their parents made huge sacrifices (loss of income and career) to provide that education.<p>The fact is, colleges, and now the military, are looking for smart, motivated people. Just dropping out and getting a GED doesn't prove any of this and might give the impression of the opposite.",1254304988

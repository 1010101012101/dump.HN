6652569,comment,6651704,6651704,2,0,tluyben2,,,"Like many have said already; how do you vote with a wallet when there is not so much choice. I need a new laptop; my macbook, after many (by apple and by myself) repairs, is falling apart. It&#x27;s fast enough, but just broken. So I was going to get the 13 inch retina, but now I&#x27;m rethinking my position. But what is the alternative... I haven&#x27;t seen much yet. I want long battery life, i7 4th gen, 13 inch and at least retina resolution. So Pixel, Ativ 9 pro, Yoga 2 pro, ... ? But I also don&#x27;t want Windows; I don&#x27;t want to pay for it. Problem... I know the thinkpad t440s  has long battery life, i7 4th gen, linux can be installed(still pay for windows), but the resolution (& GPU) are simply too depressing.<p>The tablet + phone. Firefox phone; I&#x27;ll get one of those. Tablet? Are there any which you can buy <i>now</i>?<p>I really would just like to see Ubuntu on everything; tablet, phone and laptop, but I guess that&#x27;s not really an option. I say Ubuntu because it&#x27;s the most obvious; when Ubuntu is on there I know I can replace it with another Linux and I can customize it at least.<p>Like someone said; we cry here, but we all buy macbooks anyway. While a lot of us have the power to actually change things. If 100.000 people ask Lenovo for a Linux laptop, it&#x27;ll probably come. Besides MS pressure (which is probably 100% of the reason) I wouldn&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t all offer the choice. It&#x27;s just not popular enough; check any video on any startup site on HN: everyone has macbooks.",1383296368

If that something is good and provides more value to some people than the popular alternative, then it will take off. That&#x27;s how the free market works, that&#x27;s how Android became popular.<p>Patents lawsuits on the other hand are a loophole of capitalism, preventing the emergence of competition. I haven&#x27;t been worried in a long time that Windows is still king of desktop operating systems, because Windows is no longer relevant because of technological disruption. I&#x27;m not worried if Facebook eliminates all forms of privacy controls, as teenagers are already preferring other platforms precisely because of privacy issues (e.g. who wants their grandma to see their drunk-at-party photos?). But what if Facebook will acquire enough patents as to nuke all alternative social networks?<p>Now that&#x27;s a reason to worry. And this outrage is entirely justified. I also don&#x27;t like your apathy and your cynicism. All the freedoms and luxuries you enjoy today come either from technological disruption, or from people that were outraged and that decided to do something about it.

I knew it was a bad idea but I was at the point where I was past caring and figured why not see what happens. Turns out, in order to uninstall glibc there&#x27;s a confirmation prompt, and instead of just &#x27;y&#x27; or &#x27;n&#x27; you have to type a whole sentence that&#x27;s something like &quot;yes, I understand this is a really bad idea&quot;. Well, I did that, and it was a really bad idea, the system was, unsurprisingly, basically unusable after that.",1383293883

It sounds like that last point of contention, Google may have just fixed for me.<p>Personally, I like all the changes that I read about today.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that Chrome as the default webview is a natural fit with the direction Google is taking Android. For some time now on Nexus tablets, there has been no Android browser, only Chrome. Also, you can now save &quot;web apps&quot; as applications, not just as bookmarked links. I think it is only natural that by the time Android 5 is released, you might even be able to install Chrome packaged apps just as you do with regular APK applications.<p>Android and Chrome are merging, and ChromeCast, a lightweight Android kernel that only runs Chrome, is the proving ground.",1383293418

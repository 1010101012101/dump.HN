10001872,comment,9994653,10000253,0,0,nbadg,,,"Some clarifications: first, I need to be clear that I&#x27;m not saying three protocols (one for each), I&#x27;m saying a single protocol that does all three. Approaching the problems separately leads you to something quite similar to the mess we&#x27;re already in. Second, security is a necessary but insufficient condition for privacy -- just look at Facebook. You can access it with https; that doesn&#x27;t make it private. And third, the problem is one of agency (tangent: good recent article re privacy vs agency <a href=""https://medium.com/message/mark-zuckerberg-s-personal-news-shows-why-privacy-is-the-bedrock-of-an-open-and-connected-world-e0a1acea89bd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/message/mark-zuckerberg-s-personal-news-s...</a>). The root goal of decentralization is divestiture of agency.<p>Now, for the sake of argument let&#x27;s say everyone who wants to host something online has a button that automatically deploys an SSL cert and an https server with domain name, etc. Let&#x27;s say they throw up a blog on that site. How do they create private posts? That&#x27;s the critical part, and that&#x27;s where https isn&#x27;t just unwieldy, but downright inadequate.<p>The goal of a network is to facilitate connections between agents, not between topological nodes, and https only provides confidentiality between those topological nodes. If you want everyone to be able to host their own stuff on their own servers, and still retain the ability to have a private post, you need a defined way to share things between those agents. And you could, in theory, write a decentralized protocol for that kind of sharing mechanism, but that requires a sense of who you&#x27;re sharing things with -- an identity protocol. So you need all three.<p>Now as you mentioned, identity validation is a very complicated, highly variable problem. Facebook has much lower physical verification requirements than your bank does. There can never be a perfect guarantee that this digital entity is the same as the person you have in your head, in much the same way that you can never truly guarantee that the person sitting next to you at a bar isn&#x27;t, in fact, impersonating your best friend. You just mitigate that risk as much as possible, which is best done with a protocol that allows people to implement as strict (or nonexistent! can&#x27;t rule out anonymity) a verification as they need.<p>And yeah, you could definitely write some protocols that, along with https, accomplishes the above. Arguably that&#x27;s exactly what Facebook has done (in a closed, sleazy, really not private way). But even if you wrote an open copy of facebook, it&#x27;s impractical for every single user, or even a large percentage of them, to have their own servers (this, I think, is the fundamental failing of Diaspora). So now you&#x27;re describing, almost exactly, email over https -- and it still doesn&#x27;t stop gmail from reading your messages.<p>Sorry if that&#x27;s a little meandering, it&#x27;s been a very long month and I&#x27;m exhausted right now, but I wanted to give you at least some kind of response.

10001863,comment,10000926,10000997,0,0,trhway,,,">> probabilities may not be well defined if the mechanism or method that produces the random variable is not clearly defined.<p>i don&#x27;t agree. Because it is too vague and contradictory. If you defined probabilities it strongly implies that you defined Borel algebra of sets in the space. This is what meant by the &quot;mechanism or method that produces the random variable&quot;. Without well defined Borel set (implicitly or explicitly) there is no probability at all, not just &quot;well defined&quot;.<p>To illustrate - lets take our example of random chord. One would think - take the set of all possible chords and assign equal probability to each. As the number of chords uncountable, one can&#x27;t really do such assignment and still obtain an additive measure (one of the condition of something to be a probability). We&#x27;re forced to go more coarse grained. Find or choose a set of subsets such that we can assign numbers to them such that there would be additivity when the subsets are combined and other properties making that assignment of numbers a &quot;probability&quot;, ie. we need to define a Borel algebra. The way one builds such set of subsets, an algebra, is the actual definition of the probability and it is &quot;the mechanism or method that produces the random variable&quot;.<p>So, in the Wikipedia article, for example, taking random endpoints means that we&#x27;re using, as the basis for the algebra, the open sets in the space  x S1, while taking random midpoints means that we&#x27;re building the algebra on the basis of the open sets in the space of the 2 dimensional sphere. It is pretty obvious that these 2 algebras are completely different and thus the probabilities they define are completely different, and one can&#x27;t talk about probabilities without specifying the Borel algebra defining it.",1438666847

It might look like other writers can bust out beautiful seamless prose without breaking a sweat, but what you don&#x27;t see are the hundreds of little revisions and rewrites that happen, sometimes just inside their brain.</i><p>That is so true.  I read somewhere once that a big reason many people don&#x27;t try writing is because they read <i>their</i> favorite writers, and then try to write something, and when their words don&#x27;t come out like, say, Stephen King, they give up.  And the thing I was reading (sorry, don&#x27;t remember the exact source now) was basically making the same point you just made.  So, if you want to write like Stephen King, or Dean Koontz, or Haruki Murakami or Ernest Hemingway or whoever, you have to realize that their works didn&#x27;t just flow from their fingertips in one continuous stream of perfection, from beginning direct to end.   The great writers revise and revise and edit and revise and rewriter obsessively. Or so I hear.  Koontz is notorious for saying that he only writes one page at a time, and he keeps rewriting that page until he&#x27;s happy with it.<p><i>Because writing, at its most fundamental level, is the art of making your own ideas more clear to yourself.

A lot of what you&#x27;ll find on the shelf at, say, Barnes & Noble is about fiction writing, but then again, to some extent you could say that good writing is good writing regardless of whether it&#x27;s fiction or non-fiction.    I don&#x27;t claim to be a great writer, but I can share a few titles from my own bookshelf on writing:<p>1. <i>The Elements of Style</i> - Strunk & White<p>2. <i>On Writing Well</i> - William Zinsser<p>3. <i>NLP For Writers</i> - Bekki Hill<p>4. <i>A Certain &#x27;Je Ne Sais Quoi&#x27;</i> - Chloe Rhodes<p>5. <i>A Manual For Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</i> - Kate L. Turabian<p>6. <i>The Elements of Technical Writing</i> - Gary Blake & Robert W. Bly<p>7. <i>The Art of Scientific Writing</i> - Ebel, Bliefert, Russey<p>8. <i>Writers Digest Handbook of Magazine Article Writing</i> - Michelle Rubert (ed.)<p>9. <i>On Writing</i> - Stephen King<p>10. <i>Zen In The Art of Writing</i> - Ray Bradbury<p>11. <i>Eats, Shoots & Leaves</i> - Lynne Truss<p>12. <i>Where Do You Get Your Ideas</i> - Fred White<p>13. <i>The Complete Guide to Article Writing</i> - Naveed Saleh<p>14. <i>HBR Guide To Better Business Writing</i> - Bryan A. Garner<p>15. <i>Make A Scene</i> - Jordan E. Rosenfeld<p>16. <i>Beginnings, Middles, & Ends</i> - Nancy Kress<p>I&#x27;m also a big believer in having a strong vocabulary, even though I don&#x27;t try to write in a pretentious, sesquipedalian fashion very often.  But sometimes it helps to have that &quot;just right&quot; word available.  To that end, I recommend:<p>17. <i>Big Words You Should Know</i> - David Olsen, Michelle Bevilacqua and Justin Cord Hayes<p>18. <i>The Words You Should Know To Sound Smart</i> - Robert W. Bly<p>19. <i>The Dictionary of Difficult Words</i> - John Ayto<p>20. <i>Rogets Thesaurus of Words For Intellectuals</i> - David Olsen, Michelle Bevilacqua, and Justin Cord Hayes<p>21. <i>The Thinker&#x27;s Thesaurus</i> - Peter E. Meltzer<p>22. <i>Fiske Word Power</i> - Fiske, Mallison, Mandell<p>23. <i>The Well Spoken Thesaurus</i> - Tom Heehler<p>24. <i>They Have A Word For It</i> - Howard Rheingold<p>and remember, as Aldous Huxley said &quot;<i>The proper study of mankind is books</i>&quot;.  And on that note, may I recommend keeping a couple of books of quotations around.  A good quote can be quite useful.<p>25. <i>Mark My Words - Great Quotations and the Stories Behind Them</i> - Nigel Rees<p>26. <i>The Giant Book of American Quotations</i> - Carruth & Ehrlich<p>as for websites and blogs and what-not, there is a technical writing subreddit:<p><a href=""http://technicalwriting.reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technicalwriting.reddit.com</a><p>and <a href=""https://writing.reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://writing.reddit.com</a><p>and<p><a href=""https://writinghub.reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://writinghub.reddit.com</a><p>You also can&#x27;t go wrong studying the essays of George Orwell<p><a href=""http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en</a><p>And I think that&#x27;s about all I have to contribute, except to reiterate &quot;write a lot, read a lot&quot;.<p>Source:  I have no particular distinction as a writer, but I have managed to get a few articles published at InfoWorld: <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/author/Phil-Rhodes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/author/Phil-Rhodes/</a> and I&#x27;ve written quite a few blog posts for my full-time employer, like:  <a href=""http://mammothdata.com/big-data-open-source-risk-managment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mammothdata.com/big-data-open-source-risk-managment/</a>  and I have written most of the content on the Fogbeam company blog:  <a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com</a>  I like to think that if I keep reading and writing, I might actually acquire some skill at it some day.<p>HTH, YMMV, IANAL, WTFBBQ, ETC.",1438665412

Depending on the type of packaging, a certain lid on the bin (among several) will open so that sorting is automatic, and a refund for the packaging can be either donated to a chosen charity or aggregated until a certain dollar value is accrued from future recycling deposits and paid in bulk on the spot.<p>Biggest limitations: getting a country to alter its packaging requirements to include an advanced bar-code system and a schema that is internationally recognized (ISO certified). The hardware side of things would be trivial, and when concentrated in the inner city you have fewer bins capturing a greater number of people&#x27;s waste.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m overthinking it - with machine learning the bin could determine the type of bottle/can/container, open the appropriate lid, and watch as the item is surely and safely deposited. A mid-tier smart phone could do this - use similar parts including modem to connect to a server to log a credit for the user/donate to charity.

That huge sucking sound you&#x27;ll hear are more jobs leaving the country.<p>The cynic in me thinks some politicians actually want more disparity, poverty and suffering.  Why?  Because those are the people who vote for them and keep them in office.<p>The only people who are nearly always OK despite wars, recessions, poverty and national disasters are the political class.  They exist in virtual isolation from reality.<p>It&#x27;s a really sick feedback loop:  In order to stay in power you need people who are UNHAPPY with their lives, not happy.  The unhappy masses will vote for whoever promises to improve their standing.  Their &quot;champion&quot;, if you will.  Therefore, as a politician, you talk about doing things for them and after elections you drop them on their heads, pretend to do a few things when, in reality, you didn&#x27;t make it better for anyone except yourself.<p>There are great examples of this in South American politics.  They&#x27;ve been suffering from this problem for decades on end.  This is like a virus that is hard to eradicate.  Why?  Because it is hard to make the masses vote for anyone but the person who tells them they are going to solve their problems and give them things.

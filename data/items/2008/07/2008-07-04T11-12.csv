Successful and humble.<p>""The three of us invented Intel’s flash memory business...We had to make projections of the revenue we would generate. We were so wrong it’s embarrassing to talk about it. We never envisioned this whole market that has come about with memory in cell phones. We were only looking to replace an existing chip. That’s the way we thought. It was a linear extension. You don’t think about the things that can be created with it.""<p>""I don’t want to come across as some smart ass guy who knew how to do a $1.2 billion start-up. Sometimes you get lucky. Sometimes you are unlucky, like with the Pentium bug.""",1215172791

236154,comment,235947,236132,0,0,lesslucid,,,"If the people of a country are in serious danger of being enslaved by an enemy, chances are that many people will voluntarily join the army. An unpopular war of choice, on the other hand, may struggle greatly to raise as many voluntary troops as the government desires, and this is a circumstance where conscription is both most likely and most questionable. In WW2, British men not only ""signed up"" but were conscripted, but in this case I think you rightly allude to the fact that it was called for under the circumstances; there was a real danger of much greater evils than conscription being visited on the British people if the Nazis were to triumph. But since the thread started with a question about Vietnam, I think it's worth considering the smallness of the possibility of the Vietnamese achieving the enslavement of the American people or anything of the kind at the point in time when conscription was instituted for the prosecution of that war.",1215172254

This was a year ago, so maybe they've improved, but my detailed bug report was anwered with a dumb question that showed the person had hardly read it, and then when I asked whether they could let me know when a version without this bug was released (the issue was completely blocking Opera support in my system), I was completely ignored.<p>To their credit, they did eventually fix it.",1215170759

236140,comment,235233,235924,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Most of the time the things that go wrong have little to do with individual languages. The issue with unicode is that you must be consistent across all layers of the application and there is no way to abstract it away in a general fashion.<p>For a Java based scheme implementation the primary issue may be the internal representation of scheme strings. java.lang.String is immutable whereas scheme strings are mutable. It's probably still the cleanest route to stay with some UTF-16 representation internally. Maybe StringBuilder would work but what do you do about regular expressions? I'm glad I don't have to solve that one.<p>You might also want to check out what the jruby guys say about this issue. I think I remember they made the switch from Java Strings to some other mutable representation, I believe UTF-8. They must be using some regex implementation that you might be able to reuse. Also look at SISC.<p>Another issue is the source code character escaping stuff. I don't know what the scheme standard says about this but in any event you have to think about it.<p>The last and easiest thing is to just make sure you always correctly translate back and forth when reading and writing files and network/database connections.",1215170506

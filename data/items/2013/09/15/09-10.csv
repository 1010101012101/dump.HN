6388586,comment,6388329,6388511,4,0,Perseids,,,"> But for many user input data, there is a point at which a longer value is complete nonsense.<p>The reason I still prefer arbitrary length fields is that I otherwise have to determine the limit myself. And finding reasonable limits isn&#x27;t always that easy. For example, quite a few sites have about 20 chars as maximum password lengths. Using xkcd&#x27;s correct-battery-horse-staple method (or formerly most commonly known as diceware) this assumption already fails. Also, what is the correct maximum length for a surname? (See Janice Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele.) And then there are these ridiculously short text fields for complaints or questions on sites like UPS that only allow like 400 characters (how these are encoded into bytes raises other questions about how reasonable that limit is). I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s more work to find out the right limits than to implement arbitrary length fields.<p>In the case of PBKDF2 I would say it&#x27;s the primitive&#x27;s (PBKDF2&#x27;s) fault for allowing a DOS on long passwords. I do not blame the designers though. I have read its definition several times and have never though about DOS attacks, too. Like with padding oracle or length extension attacks this should go on the check list for future designs and PBKDF2 should be phased out.",1379238886

6388583,comment,6387051,6387051,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yet another example of how schools are more about incarceration and control than education. Right now with public schools in the US we&#x27;re at the edge of spending less per student on teachers than on administrative staff and other expenses. So many forces keep telling us to increase spending on education. And we have. Whether at the K-12 level or at colleges and Universities total spending on education has more than doubled (per student, adjusted for inflation) since the 1970s, while education outcomes have generally been flat. What has increased at a pace with spending is non-teaching staff, which, not surprisingly, don&#x27;t seem to accrue any benefit in learning to the students.<p>The only way to solve the problem is to wrest control of the system away from the powerful interests that dominate it today. Unfortunately, a lot of legitimate educators are part of the machine and don&#x27;t see any other way to make things better other than to continue to feed the machine with the hope that maybe a little bit trickles down to them and the kids.",1379238606

With Common Lisp/Scheme, so much time is spent reinventing wheels due to smaller communities that they&#x27;re not worth using for larger projects, in my opinion. Also with Clojure, you always fairly easily port to Java if you decide things aren&#x27;t going as planned a couple of years down the line, as CodeHaus did with Scala. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think Clojure is by far the best Lisp to choose out there for a product, but that&#x27;s mainly because it has its big &quot;Java ogre&quot; brother standing behind it.<p>edit: And also, you don&#x27;t need to write Java in a factories on top of factories style just because some choose to do that.

The best funded candidate wins because your political parties are very weak. One of the core reasons behind this is that in 1948 you nationalised your political parties. In no other country in the world is the internal &#x27;elections&#x27; of a political party - the way you select your candidates/primaries - run by the state. In only 8 of the states (I think!) are candidates selected by members of the parties only. Membership has no meaning - which means parties have no meaning - no collective existence. This lets private money rule the day in all your parties. When I was selected as an SNP parliamentary candidate in Scotland I was forbidden to spend ANY MONEY on my selection campaign. Only paid members of the party can select a candidate - and the only way to get selected is to be known the members personally and to do the work.",1379237851

6388525,comment,6387284,6388212,2,0,FreakLegion,,,"<i>As a historical point...</i><p>All fine and good, but your claim was &quot;academics...would consider him more of a &#x27;crackpot&#x27; than Rand.&quot; That&#x27;s what I replied to, because it&#x27;s not true.<p>You asked the parent commenter &quot;have you actually read Nietzche?&quot; Well, I have, cover to cover, including the <i>Nachlass</i>. More importantly, I&#x27;ve read exhaustively in the tradition that descends from him. Nietzsche had an enormous influence on Heidegger, Gadamer, Deleuze, Foucault, Blanchot, Derrida, and just about every other important continental philosopher of the last century. And then there are all the critics, novelists, poets, painters, sculpters...<p>There&#x27;s simply no point comparing Nietzsche&#x27;s reputation to Rand&#x27;s. No one credible has ever really considered him to be a &quot;crackpot.&quot; Even analytic philosophers like Searle appreciate Nietzsche.<p><i>He was widely (wrongly) viewed as tin foil hat (nihlist, etc) for 100 years.</i><p>No, not widely, and not for 100 years. Nietzsche&#x27;s impact was already being felt both philosophically and in the arts by the 1910s.<p><i>PG&#x27;s great essay on the history of philosophy doesn&#x27;t even mention him</i><p>A few things, here.<p>1) It&#x27;s not an essay on the history of philosophy, though it does have a section titled &quot;History,&quot; which limits itself to a cursory discussion of Aristotle&#x27;s <i>Metaphysics</i>.<p>2) Much as I respect pg, I&#x27;m not sure why I should put any stock in the selection of thinkers in this essay or credit his views on philosophy. He was a philosophy major for &quot;most&quot; of college? Nifty, but like most humanities disciplines in modern universities, philosophy, at the undergraduate level, just gets you caught up with where you should&#x27;ve been when you finished high school, had high school actually done its job. Even from this short treatment, it&#x27;s clear that there are huge gaps both in pg&#x27;s knowledge and in his understanding of, for example, Wittgenstein and Aristotle. Which leads me to:<p>3) The essay is simply wrong in many of its assertions. For example:<p><i>&quot;The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is how little effect they have. No one after reading Aristotle&#x27;s Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.&quot;</i><p>If you&#x27;re interested in just how off base this is historically, here are a few things that might interest you:<p>[-] Any of James Joyce&#x27;s novels, or any criticism exploring the philosophical undercurrents of his work, e.g. <i>The Aesthetics of James Joyce</i> by Jacques Aubert. Joyce had a Jesuit education. Aristotle&#x27;s influence is immediate, palpable, and bears incredible fruit.<p>[-] A fair bit of Ezra Pound&#x27;s poetry and criticism (<i>ABC of Reading</i>, <i>Guide to Kulchur</i>, <i>The Spirit of Romance</i>, various essay collections like <i>Machine Art and Other Writings</i>, and so on). Pound was influenced not only by the <i>Metaphysics</i> but by the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> and the <i>Rhetoric</i>.<p>[-] <i>Medieval Theory of Authorship: Scholastic Literary Attitudes in the Later Middle Ages</i>, by A.J. Minnis. I mention this in a last-but-not-least way, as Minnis traces a clear path from Aristotle to how we read today.<p>Now, does <i>the average</i> person do anything differently as a result of reading Aristotle? Of course not, at least not as a <i>direct</i> result. The average person doesn&#x27;t do anything differently as a result of much at all (that&#x27;s what makes them average). But the people who set the terms of culture, the influencers? You bet your ass they do -- if not as a result of reading Aristotle, then as a result of reading some contemporary equivalent, e.g. Plato -> Baudrillard -> The Matrix -> Average Person.<p><i>Sound familiar? Slightly Nietzshean?</i><p>Not to me, no.<p><i>in the sense of not being formalistically relevant to Academic philosophy</i><p>For analytic philosophers maybe, but continental philosophers decoupled rigor from exactness long ago. Lack of exactness wouldn&#x27;t stop them from reading Rand, if they thought there was value there.<p>But you don&#x27;t need to defend Rand to me. I&#x27;m indifferent, not hostile. I only popped into the discussion to point out that Nietzsche&#x27;s place in the philosophical canon is secure.",1379235864

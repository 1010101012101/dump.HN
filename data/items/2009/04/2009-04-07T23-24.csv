How less rabid would your users become by such a change?  These are important questions that would need to be answered to gain market share.<p>My gut is that the fact that you have to hover over the image to see the price is detracting.  By comparison, you could show the price slightly more prominently, without having it be an eyesore (show in a light grey under the item picture, that maybe highlights to black when hovered over).

He easily bought a house in a great neighborhood in San Francisco.  On our street, there was a retired cop and a firefighter, and a Communications Professor at SF State.  A good friend of mine's father was a physics professor at SF State, and they owned a nice, spacious house in the Sunset.

He decided against renting his own 1br (too expensive), so he rooms with a buddy from high school (who teaches high school math).<p>So these two guys in their early 30s, one of whom is a success story out of his PhD program, rent with a roommate -where their parents easily bought and supported families.<p>You can say ""well, that's the market at work"", but then you lose your right to fret about the shortage of Americans in PhD programs in the sciences.<p>Back when it meant you'll never be rich, but you'll be able to afford a modest house in the western half of San Francisco"", I could accept the argument that it's not about the money.

Your site is pretty-- but it fails a lot of design tests if your goal is to sell stuff (IMO).<p>Selling stuff online isn't an artistic exercise-- it's an analytics and psychology exercise.<p>To be fair, that PG article is pretty ancient and commerce was a different beast back then (i.e. you might have needed high production values to overcome people's fear of online purchasing where you don't today).  ""Make your site easy"" obviously still holds true.  Are you contending that your site is easier than the competitors?  It'd be interesting to write down a few use cases and then time user success on your site versus your competitor.<p>Related: part of good commerce design is SEO.

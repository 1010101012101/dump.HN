It just means continuity of technological development. It doesn&#x27;t have to mean steady progress either; our civilization hasn&#x27;t had that, yet in ten millennia or so we have progressed from basic agriculture to space travel. For this planet, we&#x27;re talking about two million millennia, or 200,000 times the time we&#x27;ve had.

I&#x27;ve received emails that still had the template variables in them or had wrong names.<p>Having followed up on recruiter emails a couple of times I have to also state that it is a less pleasant experience than going through the employer directly. All your communication is through the recruiter and you get no feedback at all. In the case you have done an on site interview and you got to meet people, having be the recruiter telling you that the employer wasn&#x27;t looking to move forward, with no explanation whatsoever, makes a bad experience even worse.<p>In other words, these aren&#x27;t lists that I think anyone would want to be on.

And to that end, it uses an alphabet close enough to English&#x27;s that, yes, you can learn enough of to pronounce street names.<p>Here&#x27;s how you spell Beijing in Chinese: 北京.

But even if it&#x27;s theoretically possible to resolve 13 AU separations at 1400 ly, in practice the light from the star is so much brighter than the planet that it bleeds all over the image and completely washes out the reflected light of the star.<p>To do direct imaging you really need to look at systems near the Earth, maybe a few tens of ly away.

Then we just assume that other species have discovered how to create a ton of energy with Dark Matter as the by-product. We haven&#x27;t been able to observe them for the same reasons our telescopes can&#x27;t see the New Horizons spacecraft out by Pluto, just too small. And as far as observing communications.

And yet the license is worth billions.<p>Patents were created - and the US Patent Charter still states this - to encourage and enhance the economic stature of the nation.  Instead we use patents to throttle it.  Imagine if this patent were only good for a few years or up to license fee commensurate with the incremental investment needed to produce and validate the research (even if this fee were 3x, 5x, 10x, etc. of the costs).  Everyone could contribute to the work and the pace of innovation accelerates.  Instead we&#x27;ve got a couple universities (and, inevitably, follow-on corporate licensors) locking it down for all but the publicly funded and litigous.<p>There is so much opportunity out there, there are so many brilliant minds, eager innovators, and great startups.

About 6 years ago, at the end of undergrad, a technical friend and I started  working on a project. I had made websites, built computers, dabbled in minor coding, but really wasn&#x27;t <i>that</i> technical. I had no clue what to do and he probably wasn&#x27;t comfortable giving direction. I left the project when I felt I couldn&#x27;t make an equal contribution.<p>Working for six years made it obvious how valuable it is to be able to get things done offline, in a nontechnical way by planning, finding resources, etc.<p>Now I&#x27;ve become a lot more technical, the programmer of the office (VBA, ugh) to a programmer without caveats. Non-technical friends ask me to be their tech co-founder, but they have no clue how much work the technical side entails -- they probably still think freelance programmers should cost them $20/hr.<p>Also, non-tech friends will ask if they can help with my project. I can see what I would need in a non-tech founder, but a lot of times its hard to convey that to people. It&#x27;s especially hard convey to someone how much effort you expend maintaining a codebase or implementing features to a non-technical person.<p>Best luck with Genghis and your co-founder search. I hate to be a downer, but personally, I&#x27;d never take a non-technical founder that I didn&#x27;t know beforehand. It&#x27;s hard enough to gauge the skill/reliability of a tech co-founder/freelancer (with structured, defined abilities and past projects). I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable assessing someone as a cofounder based on soft-skills. It&#x27;s not a statement on their relative contribution, but more on my confidence in my own estimation.<p>*By technical, I&#x27;m also including people with domain knowledge.",1437685999

9938505,comment,9928657,9934448,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Basically if we would look at the wave function of the whole universe it would always behave in a Unitarian way. Non-unitarian behavior (such as qubit readouts) are the result of coupling our -initially isolated- quantum system with an external system that has many degrees of freedom and causes decoherence in the individual components of the original system&#x27;s wave function. A measurement operation in that sense is an entanglement of the original system with an external quantum system, followed by decoherence of the wavefunction due to the coupling of the external system to another one with a large number of degrees of freedom (which destroys the interference in the components of the wave function and thus turns a quantum state into a &quot;classical&quot; state). The role of decoherence and entanglemenr was not well understood for a long time and led to many of the seeming paradoxes of quantum mechanics, but today the theory of &quot;open quantum systems&quot; explains that behavior quite well and one can even simulate such systems using e.g. a so-called &quot;Master equation&quot; approach. What&#x27;s important to remember here is that the whole system (so initial quantum system + environment) is always behaving in a Unitarian way, but this must not be true when looking at individual parts of the wave function in isolation.",1437685498

Actually computing and searching for all strings with an edit distance of X away from the query is an incredibly poor way (Guess how long their strategy takes when you increase the edit distance to 5?) of of solving the alignment problem that throws out 40+ years of research on the problem of sequence alignment. The actual solutions to this problem solve it in tenths of a second in vastly superior ways.<p>BLAT[0] is the most obvious and preferred solution designed for alignment against a reference sequence- a 20 BP search against the human genome should essentially be instantaneous. BLAST [1] is more versatile and a bit slower than BLAT, but would also align these sequence sizes against the human genome in ~1-2 seconds, and is a traditional solution to the alignment problem, and has no license restrictions. BWA [2] and Bowtie [3] default settings could also be modified for the task (they&#x27;re optimized for performing this task with larger strings on the order of thousands of times per second).<p>More generally, it would not be difficult to re-implement any of the algorithms behind these software implementations if the authors really wanted to. It&#x27;s weird, this is the second post I&#x27;ve seen recently when software folks who are now working in the bioinformatics space have seemed completely unaware of both the basic algorithms we use in computational biology and their common implementations, like Smith-Waterman and Burrows–Wheeler.

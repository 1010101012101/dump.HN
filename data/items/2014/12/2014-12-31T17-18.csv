The audience seems to be college students.<p>I have been an avid learner since I left high school but my college experience was more understanding closed systems of teacher/professor goals and requirements (3.8 computer science graduate). I really didn&#x27;t learn anything except to be exposed  to ideas. The real learning always starts after school. What I find is we as human beings are incredible learning machines and learn efficiently already. What the OP seems to really be saying is a watered down approach to making another person happy with what they think you need to learn. AKA, express results within that system.<p>Goals, curiosity and discovery are tools to learning.",1420048783

I probably shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;engineering resources&quot; --- what I meant was total headcount: technical writers, people to do the userspace tools, test engineers, engineers to do the performance tuning, etc.   I mean the total headcount to get a fully functional, enterprise-ready production file system.   What was the total number of person years?<p>And when you say &quot;paid for itself&quot; in terms of the new line of products in 15 days of sales, were you talking about revenue, or profit?   And did you subtract out not just the BOM costs, but also the costs of designing the new hardware, the costs of the commissions for the sales people / sales channel, the support costs (both the help desk and the sales engineers), etc?    Given that I suspect (from doing research about how many PY&#x27;s other companies have needed to get a fully production-ready, enterprise quality file system) it was at least 100 person years, and knowing what the typical profit margin on hardware tends to be, even a high-margin NAS box that was intended to compete with NetApp, please forgive me if I&#x27;m finding it a little hard to believe your numbers.",1420048770

8820267,comment,8820108,8820108,0,0,chrisball91,,,"This article has an interesting angle to it but some of the points made are more opinion than actual objective issues.<p>Uber being the new and disruptive company that it is, is of course going to have some kinks and issues along the way. However like any unicorn tech company it&#x27;s about establishing themselves in the market first and clearing up some things as they go along or at a later date. Name me a breakout tech company that hasn&#x27;t had some sort of scandal or major issue at some point.<p>Some Of The authors points:
&quot;It requires you to let Big Brother track you, with a portable phone.&quot;
Phones can be traced and pinpointed by big brother regardless of what apps are installed, as long as you&#x27;ve got signal you&#x27;re not anonymous. Tracking is an integral part of the uber value proposition and experience.<p>&quot;Uber requires you to identify yourself, both to order a cab and to pay.&quot;
I can&#x27;t speak for other cities but here in London people do taxi runs, dispute fares just to take the piss and drivers can face racism from passengers. Identification and thus accountability through Uber is refreshing.<p>&quot;Uber also records where you get the cab and where you go with it.&quot;
So if an Uber Driver was to take a lone women somewhere unrequested, the fact the journey is tracked could only help this women and the police. By law here in the UK cab drivers have to take the quickest route possible, again the tracking provides safety and security for the passenger from being over charged.<p>&quot;Drivers are starting to complain that they’re left with little money for their work.&quot;
Uber is not for all drivers. Here in London every Uber driver I talk too who has a hybrid electric car loves driving for the company. They make more money from Uber then they did driving for tradition cab companies. If it doesn&#x27;t work for a driver with a petrol intensive engine, nothing is keeping them tied to the company.<p>&quot;Its practice of identifying passengers enables drivers to find out who the passenger is. This makes some women scared to use Uber.&quot;
It&#x27;s practice of identifying cab drivers and their car registration details enables users to have an arsenal of information to hand to the police should a driver be rouge.<p>I cannot help but think that bot the tracking and identification that&#x27;s so integral into Uber actually creates a safer and more enjoyable experience for users and for drivers. Uber drivers here in London tell me that the people who use Uber tend to be a higher quality and more pleasurable person to drive. I once left a driver with a 1 star rating and someone from uber got in touch with me right away, to say they don&#x27;t really care about who&#x27;s driving for them is nonsense.",1420048506

8820261,comment,8819115,8819738,0,0,staltz,,,"> How does one go about doing non-string parameterized intents?<p>From yesterday, it&#x27;s now possible to have stateful custom elements, as if they were Web Components: <a href=""https://github.com/staltz/cycle/blob/fbae9c6610043ef6e46941a9865c52751728486e/examples/livevtree/livevtree.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/staltz/cycle/blob/fbae9c6610043ef6e46941a...</a>
This brings Cycle a bit closer to React, in that a &quot;component&quot; can handle its own events. The overall approach is still different than React, because in React you are encouraged to use components for anything, while custom elements exist in Cycle only when a pure component (i.e. a function returning a virtual DOM element, in React terms, props-only component) is not enough. Hence TodoMVC could be rewritten to use <todo> custom elements.<p>Using DOM attributes to register IDs is just one technique. Things are evolving fast, and I haven&#x27;t myself tried to publish/share Cycle just yet, because it&#x27;s not ready.<p>PS: I have a lot of respect for Mithril.

Here are my reasons for choosing the stack that I did:-<p>1. couchdb: it was the obvious choice for me one because I know it well and second because it is document oriented. Most of my data is JSON representation of real world documents  like the rent contract, the monthly bills dues etc. And lastly because I feel that couchdb is an excellent server side JavaScript environment. I am using it to render templates, validate data and even for user accounts management. Lots of easy wins for me there. Plus who knows I may decide to add an offline component to my app in the future :)<p>2. Openresty: I discovered openresty from a hacker news thread (thank you HN :-). I already used nginx but I was a bit frustrated with it when I could not do some slightly complex things. Couchdb  has an http api and I just needed some tiny bit of scripting to make it suitable for my application. I think that openresty + couchcdb/elasticsearch/oritentdb/ any database with an http api is a great combo.<p>3. Jquery: old and faithful. I have worked with knockout in the past and while I really like it I feel much more productive with jquery.<p>4. simple grid: a very small css grid framework.

8820171,comment,8819620,8819620,0,0,jwmerrill,,,"The common core Mathematics standards are available for anyone to read here:<p><a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/Math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/Math/</a><p>I would encourage anyone who is really interested in this issue to spend some time reading, or even skimming just a few sections. I find the standard is generally quite readable (conceding that it&#x27;s a non-trivial commitment to read more than 1 grade level, but then again, there&#x27;s a lot to know about math...) and I also tend to agree with many of the ideas in it.<p>I&#x27;ve been disappointed, but in hindsight not very surprised by the anti-intellectualism in the public response to the common core. I&#x27;m more surprised to see similar anti-intellectualism here. I expect better from you, HN!<p>It&#x27;s true that the common core places more emphasis on critical, analytical, and sometimes even abstract thinking than the &quot;traditional&quot; math curriculum (whatever that is...). But as people who read hacker news, doesn&#x27;t that sound good to you?<p>It&#x27;s also important to know that the Common Core standards are a set of expectations, and that&#x27;s actually all they are. They are not worksheets or standardized tests. If you see a bad &quot;Common Core&quot; worksheet, it is a bad response to the Common Core, but it isn&#x27;t actually the Common Core itself. If you want to criticize the Common Core itself, choose a part of the document above and criticize it. Or failing that, criticize the process that led to its creation and dissemination. But criticizing a few oddball problems is not a powerful argument.<p>My own criticism-in-hindsight is that the Common Core is trying to do two things at once. Maybe it would be succeeding better if it only tried to do one of them at a time.<p>The first is to provide a nationally standardized set of grade level expectations. Many people have an interest in this goal because it makes it easier to prepare teaching materials for a large group of students, and to compare education effectiveness across regions. In an alternate world, this could have been done descriptively instead of prescriptively. The standards could have simply described what was happening in the largest fraction of the country&#x27;s classrooms.<p>The second goal is to improve math pedagogy in the U.S. and bring it up to the best international standards, including tying math more strongly to critical, analytical, and abstract thinking skills. This is a prescriptive goal.<p>If the standard was a process, we could have started with 1, and moved to 2 incrementally. But I suggest this only half-heartedly, because I think 2 is a great goal, and I think the Common Core (as a document) does a pretty good job of it.<p>Now to be clear about my own biases:<p>I don&#x27;t have any children (school age or otherwise). If my first exposure to the Common Core was seeing my child assigned problems that looked unfamiliar, unimportant, or even that I didn&#x27;t know how to do, I&#x27;ll concede that I might have reacted negatively too.<p>I do have a physics Ph.D. (i.e. math background), I do think and care a lot about how people understand math, and I do work on a software tool that tries to help children think about (part of) math more powerfully.",1420047142

Examples: If 8 + 3 = 11 is known, then 3 + 8 = 11 is also known. (Commutative property of addition.) To add 2 + 6 + 4, the second two numbers can be added to make a ten, so 2 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 10 = 12.

A kid does not have enough pre-existing knowledge of any ancient calendars for that association to help rather than confuse.

Almost every game is written in C++, and libraries are designed accordingly.<p>Also, I would not recommend learning both server-side Python and Node. Node is not objectively better so there is no real reason to switch over just because it&#x27;s &quot;hot.&quot; Python has much more mature libraries and modules.<p>Large projects are not good for beginners, they cause sunk cost fallacy and probably repel a lot of people from new disciplines. Better to adopt a series of smaller, exploratory projects rather than reaching towards a momentous goal from the start. Beginners will only find themselves refactoring the same code over and over and over as they learn how to be idiomatic and efficient.<p>I <i>would</i> second the no CodeAcademy-style tutorials advice, and recommend picking up a good book in whatever language you wish to learn. Not a &quot;For Dummies&quot; style book, but one that is respected in the language community.

It isn&#x27;t really a good way to learn programming: 90% HTML/CSS work that doesn&#x27;t involve control flow and 10% string munging.

Introducing new standards, means a new curriculum and a new curriculum means a lot of unpaid personal time from teachers if you want them to really adopt it and teach it well.<p>I just don&#x27;t see a new curriculum working well unless it comes with the notion of paid extra-time that you know teachers will have to put in to succeed with the new curriculum. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a lot, but simply 5-10 more hours each week and a bonus equal to 10-25% of their salary to make up for the additional time would probably work. The only key would be that there needs to be a way to measure that teachers are putting in the extra time to really learn the new curriculum and apply it instead of collecting the bonus for putting in the minimum effort.<p>At the end of the day, it you don&#x27;t budget both time and money to learn any new curriculum, it&#x27;s either going to fail or be met with resistance from teachers who feel like they already have a system that works for them and their students.<p>[0] either in the same semester or school year because you teach multiple groups the same material or after 2-3 semesters or school years of teaching the subject to one group at a time",1420045336

All it requires is that there be some concept of a &quot;store&quot; whose changes can be subscribed to, and the view and its children update automatically. That &quot;store&quot; can be a huge imperatively-driven series of Backbone.Collections, or it can simply be the end of a chain of compositional events using whatever structure or programming model you want. In many ways, it&#x27;s a way for an application to decouple its view logic from its <i>choice</i> of event processing model. So you can start with a very simple view structure, and then with minimal refactoring you can swap out your event processing model for FRP as you need it. And it doesn&#x27;t require your programmers to start thinking about type systems and immutability at the very beginning.<p>Do I have some gripes with React&#x27;s API? Sure. But it&#x27;s a good start.",1420045293

In math it&#x27;s very simple for a kid to get hung-up on one simple thing and then they have this hole and cause things build on previous knowledge later things are now trouble as well.<p>For example one of my children could not factor in the way I was taught with the trees, but another way was presented and it totally clicked for her. For one of my sons he could not do long division in the manner I was taught, but another method worked for him instantly. He showed me and I even liked it, cause I remembered how hung-up I had been about getting the correct digit at each step myself.<p>I also like how it seems to have this component about reasoning. To many people math is arithmetic, but it really is not that. The problem is that there are kids where requirements were different. So for example now a third grader is supposed to have memorized multiplication table, but there were schools that never did that before. Or a sixth grader is now already supposed to have done some geometry, but the school only did it in 8th grade or HS before. There is no route to fill in the gaps during this transition in many schools it seems.",1420045203

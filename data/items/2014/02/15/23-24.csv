Of course they tried to raise the price on me once but I was able to call and get it back down. The next time they raised the price, there was no 19.99 internet only option. The customer service agent checked and checked and checked, but &quot;couldn&#x27;t find it available in the system&quot;. There was, of course, a 19.99 deal for the same speed internet AND basic cable + HBO/HBOGo. So I&#x27;m riding this promotion out for as long as I can. Although they were required to send the set-top box, I asked them not to send out a tech to hook it up. I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less about basic cable. The HBO Go on the other hand, I enjoy thoroughly. I was finally able to get around to watching Sopranos =].<p>Eventually they&#x27;ll learn that story-telling isn&#x27;t meant to be interrupted by advertisements. The content is gravely diminished when this happens. I find myself not caring about plot after so many commercial breaks. Made worse by the terrible, &quot;coming up next on blah blah blah&quot; hook.<p>I can see some sports fanatics enjoying the &#x27;luxuries&#x27; of basic cable, as I don&#x27;t believe there are any fool proof options online yet - I also don&#x27;t care.",1392508788

7246046,comment,7245175,7245809,2,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"Sure.  First of all some context.  Mankiw wrote one of the main textbooks while I was doing economics at university.  I was one of the few people who also took philosophy and the like, who came to economics because I found the area itself fascinating rather than wishes for employment/riches, and who discovered economics as a subject relatively late (after philosophy and IT) so you might say I contrast Mankiw, Marx and Megabytes :P (and don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not a communist :P)<p>My opinion of Mankiw, and the work of places that have hired him, is not particularly high. I don&#x27;t think their work is intellectually very rigorous (not to be confused with &quot;academically&quot; rigorous via referencing lots of papers, using models and language the layman doesn&#x27;t understand, and hiding behind institutional status).  It doesn&#x27;t deal with many of the questions and complexities and outcomes that people actually care about, and they clearly push an agenda behind a facade of legitimacy.<p>The &quot;rich pay more taxes&quot;, specifically, is just such a juvenile, dumb, populist thought terminating cliche.  &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; probably funded more parks than the average man, but what the hell does that mean? &quot;The pope&quot; built more churches. If you redistribute money from the rich to the poor, now the poor pay more taxes!  And what does that mean now? NOTHING! Should we do it? I don&#x27;t know!  &quot;The rich pay more taxes&quot; is a regular throw-away line from those who generally wish to lobby for the wealthy, reliant  upon the idea of &quot;agency of money and those who hold it&quot; in our current society rather than analysing money and its relationship to actual societal outcomes, beliefs, structures and social power.  Queen victoria and the pope, of course, didn&#x27;t actually build those parks or those churches (Viccy wasn&#x27;t very good at bricklaying for a start), but they had the social power to get others to do it for them.  But does that in itself legitimize their positions, power and actions?<p>So you read Mankiw&#x27;s editorials, and they contain a whole bunch of cheap appeals that are easily dismissed, and not much content (and that goes for his work as well).  Why did wages and the like suddenly take off in the financial sector compared to how it used to be historically in relative conservative banking?  Is this because they weren&#x27;t worth much or very competent before? How does debt, power imbalance, informational asymmetry, and turnover enter into all this? Why are remunerations so volatile if their wages are meritorious? What about when these golden-handshakes aren&#x27;t connected to their actual performance?  How do boards measure the worth of CEO&#x27;s when everyone else can&#x27;t? What about intercultural/temporal/national differences in pay/situations? Would we actually be better off if we took money from the rich, distributed it, and had a more even distribution of both wealth and taxes? What about heirs?<p>No one intellectually serious or competent would ever spout such lines if they genuinely wanted to discuss the issue.  But Mankiw, and the institutions that hire him, generally don&#x27;t want to seriously discuss the issue.<p>Hence, complete sham.<p>/my, that sounds really harsh.",1392508758

The $50/month I&#x27;m saving by not having cable included isn&#x27;t really going toward savings, and we could certainly afford it.  It&#x27;s just that it had a detrimental effect: we&#x27;d watch things that we weren&#x27;t all that interested in, we&#x27;d sit through hours of commercials.  My wife and I were generally annoyed with the whole experience, but because it was available and easy we were sucked into it.<p>We cancelled the cable and we are less annoyed.  We spend an extra 15 minutes downloading what we want, and we spend less time as vegetables just passively accepting what&#x27;s coming down the pipe.  Less time spent watching commercials that annoy us.  It&#x27;s very much worth it.  (Although I miss watching live sports in HD... but not enough to pay for it)",1392508744

I&#x27;m untroubled by any contradiction there.<p>The best piano player in the world may capture 95% of the album sales for Schumann&#x27;s Concerto in A minor, without being twenty times better than the sadly impoverished second best. Stuck with number two, the empire would hardly crumble. Some markets, including patent races, just funnel all returns to first place. Aside from first past the post effects, we also have a market containing inheritance, unregulated monopolies, and the swings of fortune to name a few others. Not all of wealth is luck, but some seem to insist it never plays any role. Thomas Gilcrease comes to mind. Great philanthropist and wonderful businessman, got his start by essentially winning an incredible lottery.<p>Progressive taxation can serve as a headwind to correct some of these excesses without scrutinizing desert[1] on a case by case basis (a monumental judicial task with suspect gains). The downside of a blanket solution is that you end up mixing the sheep of deserving rich in with your goats.<p>To protect the noble wealthy that end up unfairly persecuted by such a headwind, we should just fight to make sure that tax policy doesn&#x27;t suddenly beggar anyone, make sure that the ranking of wealth isn&#x27;t significantly shuffled, limit how much markets are distorted, ensure a simple code that&#x27;s easy to comply with and difficult to cheat, and make sure government expenditures are constrained wherever feasible. These areas could use significantly more work even if our tax structure went largely unchanged.[2]<p>We can also take some comfort in the knowledge that a rich man in a progressive society is still, at the end of the day, a rich man, and may somehow muddle through. That&#x27;s not to be too dismissive, I do think social justice is important for every individual. But I admittedly struggle to give equal weight to the problems of the rich when thinking of other social issues, like racial disparities in incarceration, or the treadmill to homelessness for those without access to mental health care.

For creatures like humans -- born with helpless young -- the person who has two children and lives long enough to ensure that they can pass on their own genes is more evolutionarily fit than the person who procreates like mad but lets all their children die.<p>In our evolutionary environment, post-procreative individuals played vital roles in ensuring the survival of the young: taking care of children while their parents were off hunting and gathering; preparing foodstuffs; passing on lore about which plants were dangerous to eat, etc. In this way, the presence of elders facilitated the propagation of genes -- right up to the point where the care and maintenance of said elders becomes such a drain on resources that it begins to diminish rather than enhance the survival and procreation prospects for the young.

There are reasons to believe this would be more difficult than attacking any of your normal passwords individually though:<p>- The database for your passwords is not stored on a server they&#x27;re likely to have been compromised, (it&#x27;s a local file on your machine unless you place it somewhere else or your machine itself is compromised.)<p>- By having only one database, you can use an approach like a long diceware pass phrase. Which would allow you to generate a password for the database that&#x27;s likely to be far harder to guess than any individual password that you might otherwise have used for the sites in the database.<p>- It&#x27;s plausible to direct more processing towards making dictionary and guessing attacks against your database&#x27;s password harder than a server would be likely to direct towards each individual user&#x27;s password.<p>In case<p>2) If you mean could they crack the password for the website that you keep <i>in</i> the keypass file, by attacking the hash that they got from the server attack:<p>Theoretically, yes. However, again, there are several qualities in favour of the keepass approach:<p>- Generation is automated. People are usually bad at generating hard to guess passwords. We think that we&#x27;re making something hard to guess by inserting letters and numbers into a few words and then going &#x27;presto!&#x27; but in reality we tend to follow fairly common patterns in what words we pick, what letters we replace, and so on. We also tend to duplicate them across sites.<p>- Remembering and entry are automated. (We tend to be bad at remembering things that don&#x27;t follow common patterns.) Thus making these generated passwords more practical to use.<p>Those two factors combined address the main weaknesses of passwords. It&#x27;s not something innate about the database that does this, mind. You could do much the same yourself if you had a perfect memory, or a notebook, and were willing to sit there throwing dice to get a good entropy source. However, I&#x27;ve yet to meet a human who remembers a significant number of dice-generated pass-phrases for all their accounts, and writing your passwords down represents its own potential problems (loss, compromise, speed of entry when reading the things.) The way to bet is that this is going to give you a harder to attack password than you&#x27;d come up with by yourself.<p>They also reduce the impact of a compromise. If a password for a site is compromised, then that compromise is limited to that website, and relatively easily rectified as compared to a more general breach if you reused your passwords.<p>For instance, my hacker news password until shortly before this post was:<p>4ea3a70a8361ab5d2006fbe0f98b52f2bcc6512a866e9ddaf2e9ea951d01dbed<p>But that&#x27;s worthless information now. I told my password prog to generate another string, and now it&#x27;s something else. Took less than a minute.<p>#<p>Of course, if your keepass vault itself is compromised, then you may be dealing with a worse situation. However, considering the general weakness of passwords, and the degree to which they get duplicated, and the additional security features around things like banks that protect some of the more vital stuff, I&#x27;m not sure that even putting all your eggs in one really well guarded basket makes you significantly more vulnerable if it is broken into.<p>But regardless, the cost of attacking an individual user goes up dramatically, whereas the rewards don&#x27;t seem to scale in line with that. If someone thinks you&#x27;re interesting enough to attempt to compromise your computer, get the database, and then invest resources in guessing your database password... you&#x27;ve probably got more serious problems anyway.",1392507806

Then you pay %35 federal (or is it %39 yet), + 8% state + 5% city on income, for a total of %48 income taxes. If you are an employee, you have to add SS, employment tax, fica and whatnot on top of that, which easily gets you past the 50% mark. But that doesn&#x27;t actually include any kind of health coverage, and when you go to university (or your kid does), you&#x27;re going to pay 5-10 times as much. To an american, it seems reasonable to borrow $200K at age 20 against your future earnings to go to college, even though 40% don&#x27;t get to the finish line (student loans, so not even dischargable by bankruptcy). It would be considered insanity, if it was even a possibility, everywhere else.<p>Oh, and you still have the 8.5% tax in NYC. not 20% VAT, but not that far - and the VAT is not as simple as it looks - if you run a business, it often doesn&#x27;t affect you as much, because in many countries, only the &quot;last mile&quot; pays it.<p>Finally - US tax law regarding domestic finances might be comparable to the UK one (I would guess not, with the US federal code standing at >70,000 printed pages, and IIRC the UK code standing at <20,000). But if you have another nationality, or a significant investor of yours does, or you have anything resembling a bank account outside the US - then US tax laws become ten times more complex, and you are assumed guilty at any point of the way.

A customer in western Illinois calls you out; you drive over the Mississippi River, service the customer&#x27;s refrigerator on-site, and then drive back home. You have clearly engaged in a the sale of services in Illinois. You can&#x27;t really argue this service call legally took place in Iowa, since neither the refrigerator nor the customer nor the physical location of the activity was in Iowa (not even if the customer mails you a check to your Iowa address rather than paying cash in Illinois). If Illinois has regulations on servicing refrigerators, or taxes related to this occupation, you&#x27;re responsible for following them. If you want to follow <i>only</i> Iowa law, you need to service only refrigerators within Iowa&#x27;s borders! That follows from the principle that Iowa has no authority to dictate the rules that govern servicing Illinois refrigerators.<p>Similarly, if you&#x27;re a computer consultant who lives in Iowa and you drive to Illinois to service a customer&#x27;s mainframe or install a software package on their workstations, or whatever else it is you do, you&#x27;re engaged in the service business in Illinois.

They claim it had vaccination one day before at the same hand.<p>2) Doctor makes xray, finds hand is broken and fixate it.<p>3) Hospital calls SS and police. Couple is escorted by police to court straight from hospital with baby.<p>4) They get advocate assigned from court and the hearing starts at the same evening (5 hours after they come into hospital)<p>5) Their defendant is arrogant, tell them to shut up and does not explain anything. Plus he does not speak slovak and their english is not adequate for this stuff<p>6) Court postpones decision into other hearing. They are free to leave. At outside police is waiting to seize baby, officers do not believe court did not made decision.<p>7) At 11 PM they finally arrive home from hospital with baby.<p>8) At 4 AM they decide to leave country, at 6 AM they are on airplane to continental europe.<p>9) At 7:30 AM police came at their london door with order to seize baby<p>10) 2 days latter they contact slovak police, disclose their location and ask for help. They also contact media.<p>I am really not going into more of those shit. I know several people who fled UK because of fear for their baby.

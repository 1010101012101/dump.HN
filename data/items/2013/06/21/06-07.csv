Hiring for low wage jobs doesn&#x27;t necessarily raise financial status, but gives access to social services and prevents side-effects like detachment from the job market, petty crimes, mental illnesses and addictions. Or to put it more simply: do you prefer an unemployed who&#x27;s got cash for booze and nothing to do, or would you prefer him to be at work like all his peers and family?",1371797880

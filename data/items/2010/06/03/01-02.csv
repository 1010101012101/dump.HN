I'd say that it does help in a number of ways.<p>For one, it is an excellent way to hone the practice of focusing your mind on your immediate activity. In Buddhist mindfulness practice you will focus your mind not just while sitting meditation, but also while walking or doing chores.  Eventually you will be able to bring this focus to every activity you engage in during the day.<p>So in a way you move into the zone on a semi-permanent (or even permanent) basis.<p>The broader Buddhist philosophy is also an excellent way to eliminate distractions from your mind. In that philosophy, thoughts and feelings arise almost exclusively due to internal processes, and an important aspect of mindfulness meditation is letting those same thoughts and feelings go.  So instead of distracting you like normal, the thoughts and feelings will ""run their course"" and dissipate much more quickly.<p>This is how the practice has benefited me the most.  I now know that my normal distractions (e.g. checking HN compulsively) are not going to provide anything for me -- they are not a source of happiness or contentment.  The mindful focus is my source of that happiness and thus preserving it is what I naturally want to do.<p>All that said my practice is far from perfect, as I do find myself here reading and answering questions.

Consequently, it is really difficult to diagnose. My primary symptom was iron-deficiency anemia, for instance, but the traditional answers that start with that symptom would have been wrong. Also, despite malnutrition, I was also obese. (Not ""clinically obese"", but obese no matter how you slice it.)<p>There are two things going for this diagnosis (even as I tip my head to the ""don't trust internet diagnoses"" crowd). First, per chasingsparks' excellent point, you shouldn't look for something rare when something common may explain it. In fact, Celiac is not a rare disease; estimates are now hovering around the 1 out of 133 people in the general US population, which is not really a ""rare disease"". The odds of at least one other person reading this message having Celiac without knowing it is actually virtually 100%, because of the second thing: It is <i>known</i> to be underdiagnosed due to the difficulty of diagnosing it correctly. It appears to match everything you've described, up to and including a known correlation between Celiac and other autoimmune diseases (especially when left untreated) and raised IgA. Testing for IgA is a standard first step of a screening: <a href=""http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/celiac-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/celia...</a><p>With this you should be able to find a doctor who can help you confirm or deny this diagnosis, assuming you have not yet tried a gastroenterologist.<p>If there are money issues, the ""don't eat gluten"" test rksprst mentions is actually as good as the medical tests, if not better. Stop eating gluten for two weeks, or preferably three. If you feel better after that, then you may be on the right track, but wait, it might be placebo. To be <i>really</i> sure, have yourself a big ol' bowl of pasta or pizza. In about 5-7 hours or so, if you're suffering from Celiac... <i>you'll know</i>. And I apologize for that night. But at least you'll know after that.<p>Be aware you can not do both. Celiac tests only pick up ""in progress"" Celiac, if you cut out the gluten for three weeks, <i>then</i> go to the doctor, you will quite likely test negative even if you have it.<p>At your age, full recovery could take 3-4 years, but you'll start feeling better right away.<p>I feel your pain. My father was diagnosed in the nick of time for me to figure out what my problem was. I too was starting to lose enough cognitive power that I fear I would have lost my job.<p>Edit: Also, if this does turn out to be the problem, start taking a multivitamin. Many people say that multivitamins are not helpful for normal people. This may be true, I honestly don't know. Celiac is not ""normal people"" and I've found it helpful well beyond what ""placebo"" would cover. You may be able to stop when recovered, I'm just barely getting to ""recovered"" myself.<p>And yes, this could be me having a hammer and seeing a nail. Still, it does fit, right down to the difficulty of getting it properly diagnosed.",1275528488

Given that Python's implementation (CPython, with a GIL) was started in December of 1989 (<a href=""http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/brief-timeline-of-python.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/brief-timeline-of...</a>) I'd say that it worked fabulously at the time, and pretty much until multicore/multiprocessor architectures really became the topic du-jour.<p>Think about that; CPython's internal are old - sure, they've changed and been cleaned up and fixed up here and there, but it's still old. Obviously if it was written today, it might be done differently knowing what we know now.<p>So, yeah - it <i>is</i> excusable, given that it meets the original design goals of making C extensions dirt simply to write (really, they are dirt simple) and making the common, single threaded/single processor use case fast ""enough"".<p>Given the hindsight everyone has now - yeah, the GIL as it exists today is grossly suboptimal, and I don't know of anyone of rational mind or body who doesn't want it to go the way of the dodo, or at least be replaced with a cleaner, simpler and faster implementation. The latter is in progress in Python 3 - the former is a lot more difficult despite a lot of hand waving from non-committers and armchair interpreter designers.<p>Python's performance can (and is, and will) be improved over time, but as I said originally, it was never advertised as ""the fastest"" or ""the most concurrent"" language, those two things have never been a core ""feature"" of the language.",1275527104

I thought it was slow, but wrote it off as a limitation inherent to the Datastore. I moved a lot of things to the Memcache level, mitigating (mostly) the slow queries. That being said, I am glad it was actually a real problem.<p>I'm also impressed that they are not charging anyone until the problem is solved.",1275527092

1400016,comment,1399450,1399450,0,0,icey,,,"Of the symptoms you've listed, I've had these problems:<p><pre><code>  severe fatigue\n  non-refreshing sleep\n  memory loss, inability to concentrate or focus\n  muscle pain\n  dizziness\n  nasal congestion, always having to clear my throat\n  heat intolerance\n</code></pre>\nI am still working on resolving some of these, but the biggest 2 culprits were:<p>1. Chronic dehydration. Even though I thought I was drinking plenty of water (probably 64 ounces a day), it turned out it wasn't enough. Now I drink at least a gallon of water a day - drinks containing caffeine don't count, and most days I drink 1.5 gallons or so. This helped almost all symptoms to some degree.<p>2. Food allergies, corn syrup specifically. I can eat it and not really notice any effects immediately, I assume that's because it's been in my system since a very early age; but cutting out all food and drinks that contain corn syrup has resulted in <i>significant</i> improvements with regards to fatigue, sleep quality, muscle spasms, memory / focus and nasal symptoms.  Regular corn on the cob doesn't seem to have nearly the same effects on me as corn syrup does. I don't know if it's a glycemic index thing or what. What I know is that it's easy to replicate the problem, I can go have a soda or a bunch of white bread that uses corn syrup and I get so exhausted I feel like I'm going to pass out. But if I try Mexican Coke, for example, I feel fine.<p>I'm not a doctor and have never played one on TV, but my personal guess is that your problems may be diet related. You could try a divide and conquer diet to see if you feel any improvements. Worst case scenario is that it forces you to have a healthier diet while you're figuring out the real cause of your problems.<p>I would also recommend seeing an actual allergist instead of your regular doctor. I started allergy treatments with my primary care physician and he loaded me up with a bunch of drugs that didn't do me any good. I went to an allergist and have a plan that seems to be working in the long term war against allergies.<p>Good luck to you, I hope you find out what the problem is (and come back to tell us about it).",1275526985

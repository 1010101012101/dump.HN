I wish I could have come up with cold hard data to get rid of them. Instead the best I could do was move them around.

Feinstein is part of the US ruling class and has been for decades. She now has more in common with foreign leaders than US citizens she supposedly represents. Once you understand her mindset her views make perfects sense.<p>Unfortunately these paternalistic views are pervasive with our leaders so I doubt replacing her would help.

So just because something is not close to toxicity, does not mean it is actually having a net benefit on your health. With vitamins, take the recommended dosage, or preferably slightly less, as it is likely you are getting at least something from your diet, not matter how poor. Anything above that is likely to start having negative effects that start to outweigh any benefits. Most adults get sufficient vitamins and minerals from their diet, even a poor western diet.

People won&#x27;t do it.  They&#x27;ll take the POLR: fake accounts.  Kicking them out also won&#x27;t help: they can attack the brand and also if they succeed, the service looks like the bad guys.  Furthermore, it builds stats by having more accounts registered on the platform.  Whether those fake accounts get killed off is up to the business owner.  Is padding stats worth the liability and cost of junk accounts?<p>We&#x27;re still talking about DistroKid, so it just bought them free PR.<p>The point is everyone can make more money by taking a calculated gamble on positive ROI giveaways.  The unit cost of an app is often pennies.  Any concern about mass defection of paid users to unpaid is unlikely if the service is good and shows trying to take the high road.  And that adds goodwill valuation to the brand.  These intangibles make the service of higher value than a formulaic subscription service that thinks short-term only.  It&#x27;s not quite the same as selling gym memberships.  :)<p>The meta is that when a service is small, keeping CAC low and getting as many users as possible while maintaining cool is hard.  The churn between paid, unpaid and closed accounts is also a delicate dance to keep satisficing toward $.  Sometimes giving accounts away in exchange for something non-monetary is a way go (real friends or not).<p>And also, don&#x27;t forget gangster marketing: <a href=""http://youtu.be/t73Q3f4YjwQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/t73Q3f4YjwQ</a>",1383011642

In the demo, we had a specialized retina which was faster and gave a few percentage points more accuracy on reCAPTCHA; the downside being it not working well on the checkerboard pattern. (Or any pattern where some portions of the letter are black and some portions of the letter are white). Its just like putting on sunglasses being specialization we add to our eyes for going out in the sun, which causes us to see some other patterns not as well.

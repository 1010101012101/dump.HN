2682039,comment,2681554,2682019,1,0,bad_user,,,"You cannot re-frame when shooting moving subjects - kids playing, sports, birds, cars, motorcycles, boats - there's all kinds of instances in which your subject doesn't stand still and even has unpredictable moving patterns, so keeping your subject in the center of the frame and/or re-framing is in many instances not feasible.<p>Nikon DSLRs have this 3D tracking feature in which you select an object to keep in focus and it refocuses based on its movement inside the frame when it hits the focus points. And when the subject exists the frame and re-enters, auto-focus comes back. 51 focus points may seem like feature creep, but as I said, it's freaking awesome when shooting moving targets like birds.<p>Even for subjects that are still, like for portraits, you have a lot more freedom for composition as you just select the person's eyes and then you can move around while the eyes are kept in focus.<p>Of course, you can do a good job with a single focus point, but professionals and amateurs need predictable results, because good moments for taking photos are rare and you don't want to screw up because your camera wasn't properly focused.<p>That's why I can see partly the utility of this technology here, but on the other hand I can see serious problems with it too, the biggest one being that for most people quantity of photos trumps quality. Another problem that I can see is the one I mentioned above; precise and predictable focus is not that much of a problem with modern cameras. And yet another: mega-pixels and quality of optics count a lot. Well, maybe once passed a certain threshold, the there's less ROI from a higher MP, but still, under 6 MP a camera is only usable for publishing on Facebook.<p>My consumer DLSR has 4 FPS and I don't worry about focus as I just continuously shoot like 20-30 pictures in a row to make sure one of them is good, and usually one of them is.",1308725314

They all have a huge depth of field due to their small sensors, so you have to try really hard to put something out of focus. Smudged pictures on point and shoots are usually not a result of lack of focus, but something else (e.g. shaky camera).<p>Even with DSLRs you usually only need one focus point. You can focus at the center and re-frame. It is very simple to do, and is much simpler than choosing a focus point (and much safer than trusting the camera to automatically choose a focus point for you). Multiple focus points can be very useful in certain rare circumstances: when shooting something really fast off of center without being able to pre-focus or when your camera is bolted down on a stand. Even then I cannot possibly imagine one anyone would need 51 points. This is obvious feature creep.<p>But yeah, I am really not sure who the intended market for this camera is. Focusing is just not a pain point, in my opinion. This camera could be used by artists and professional photographers to play around with the depth of field to get a great artistic shot, without making their subjects wait.

It is definitely a weakness for bitcoin that a shady exchange has captured 90% of the market, but this problem isn't inherent to bitcoin. It seems likely that in the wake of news like this, new exchanges will be created to try to capitalize on MtGox's misfortune, and the exchange landscape will broaden.<p>As long there is someone, somewhere willing to put up products or state currency in exchange for bitcoins, bitcoins will have their value. The best case scenario for bitcoin could be for MtGox to go down in flames because if it bitcoin held its value, it would prove that its fundamentals are sound, and its price is based on legitimate demand for an anonymous medium of exchange, not pure speculation.<p>If a MtGox collapse <i>did</i> cause a bitcoin collapse, it would show that bitcoin is not the real deal, just the result of a speculative frenzy. This may be hard to stomach, but it's better than continuing to ignorantly pile money into a bubble so fragile it can be popped by the guessing of a single password.<p>In my opinion this guy, if he really wants the best for bitcoin, should sue MtGox hard if he honestly thinks what they did is wrong/illegal/breaks contractual agreements.

     all over  but what fun is that?
</code></pre>
With DSLRs that have huge lenses with large aperture sizes, the depth of field varies a lot and those lenses also have a sweetspot in focal-length / aperture for which images produced are the sharpest. Lowering the aperture size increases the depth of field, but then you've got another problem as the shutter speed also has to be adjusted and you end up using a tripod.<p>Getting a picture that has everything in focus and is tack sharp can be seriously challenging.<p>To tell you the truth, while these photos with adjustable focus seem cool, focus is not my pain - what I want is to be able to take great photos (the kind that 35mm cameras can do) for reasonable prices, preferably with something that fits in my pocket.<p>And to expand on the point above - focus is not painful when the camera has enough focus points. I played with a Nikon D3s that has a whooping 51 auto-focus points; let me tell that it's freaking awesome, as it can track your subject as it moves. The problem is that consumer-level DX DSLRs only have like 11 focus points, which is still cool, but point&shoots suck badly in this area, most of them focusing only in the center of the image.<p>Another problem with this project that I can see - people don't like playing with their images on the computer. When you take 500 photos in a single day, and another 600 photos the next day (like when going on a trip), it's really painful to carefully adjust each image, not to mention that the RAW formats are huge and seriously cuts in the number of photos you can take ... yeah, making adjustments is great, but I prefer making more photos, that's why I shoot in JPG and don't regret it.",1308723063

2681957,comment,2679769,2679769,8,0,jacobolus,,,"In a quite similar example of a bad convention, I find it extremely frustrating that many programming languages do not have a modulus operator (%) which behaves as modulo in mathematics. To be explicit, there are multiple choices of the sign of:<p><pre><code>  x % y
</code></pre>
When either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> is negative, or both (the full details are described at Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation</a>). In common mathematical notation <i>x</i> mod <i>y</i>, the result always shares the sign of the divisor <i>y</i>. For example,<p>14 mod 10 = 6<p>6 mod 10 = 4<p>The same is the case in python:<p><pre><code>  >>> -14 % 10
  6
  >>> 6 % -10
  -4
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, in JavaScript (and various other languages), a different convention is chosen. The result instead shares the sign of the dividend:<p><pre><code>  > -14 % 10
  -4
  > 6 % -10
  6
</code></pre>
This is really annoying because we quite frequently want to use the modulus operator to do things like normalize an angle to the range [0, 360). To perform this normalization on an angle <i>a</i> in JavaScript, if <i>a</i> < 0, requires a computation like:<p><pre><code>  a_prime = a % 360 + 360
</code></pre>
I end up usually defining a function like:<p><pre><code>  var mod = function (x, y) {
    var js_mod;
    return (js_mod = x % y) && (x > 0 ^ y > 0) ? js_mod + y : js_mod;

277734,comment,276959,277437,0,0,olavk,,,"BTW. the HTML is not valid XML so your example is a bit misleading. The P-elements contain the paragraphs rather than delimit them. The XML would be more verbose since it needs end-tags for P:<p><pre><code>    <p>Note that you would also need to gzip your 
    s-expressions if you are concerned about size.</p>
</code></pre>
The s-expr OTOH would be more confusing, because there isn't a clear distinction between element-name and content:<p><pre><code>    (p Note that you would also need to gzip your 
    s-expressions if you are concerned about size.)
</code></pre>
You might want to choose a different syntax to make the distinction clearer:<p><pre><code>    (p ""Note that you would also need to gzip your
    s-expressions if you are concerned about size."")</code></pre>
or:<p><pre><code>    ((p) Note that you would also need to gzip your
    s-expressions if you are concerned about size.)
</code></pre>
In the end, you have to make some of the same trade-off decisions that the designers of SGML and XML did. Just saying that s-expressions are simpler than XML is like saying ASCII is simpler than s-expressions: True, but kind of missing the point.",1218897906

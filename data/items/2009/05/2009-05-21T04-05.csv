619924,comment,619326,619326,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"I've been an IEEE and ACM member for over 20 years.  Although I've cut back on the number of publications I subscribe to, I still find reading them very informative. I can read them on the train/bus/beach.  They provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art.  
Consider the subscriptions to be part of your on-going professional development. In Australia, the subscriptions are tax deductible so that helps too.
As for the myIEEE, I find Google Scholar more useful.  But that's when I'm trying to follow a specific topic.
The permanent e-mail address on acm.org has been excellent for staying in contact as I change jobs, ISPs, etc.",1242881824

619921,comment,618881,619710,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Yeah, but ""saturation"" as you're using it is arbitrary, based on HSL or HSV, which are extremely simple transformations of RGB space, which means that it's based on the (arbitrary) choice of R, G, and B primaries for your screen. HSL/HSV were developed because computer hardware of the 1970s couldn't do large lookup tables or complex math with any kind of reasonable performance.  There is really no excuse for them to persist to 2009, and that they are still being baked into specs is something of a travesty.  They're essentially pre-20th century color theory pseudo-science, resurrected because anything better was too computationally expensive 35 years ago.<p>What you're looking for (to be perceptually meaningful, based on real psychometric data) is something like the ""chroma"" of the Munsell Color System.

619889,comment,619110,619828,0,0,bokonist,,,"1) Read ""Gang Leader for a day"" or watch the Wire and then compare it to a first hand account of the slums of the 1900s.  We are richer now thanks to technology.  But the pathologies and decay of the slums is much, much worse.  The progressive movement replaced a highly functional system of private and city government charity with a bureaucratic system that creates dependency, has no interest in actually solving the problems of the people it serves, and leaves housing projects to rot away.<p>2)  Credentialism.  From the Pendleton Civil Service Act to laws giving monopoly rights of practicing medicine to the AMA guild, the progressive movement towards credentialism gave government subsidies and monopolies to a class of people who could pass the civil service exam.  These artificial barriers to entry result in a direct transfer of funds from the poor and working class to the college educated elite. For one example of many: <a href=""http://libertariannation.org/a/f12l3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libertariannation.org/a/f12l3.html</a><p>3)   The Fed/Bretton Woods/Fiat currency.  The progressive movement turned our financial system from a bottom up system (loans and banking happened at a community level) to a top down system ( all banking originates out of Fed guarantees and a government printed currency).  This has resulted in insane profits for Wall St.  At the same time, because the USD is the reserve currency of the world, the U.S. exports dollars, and then gets back real goods at a very cheap price.  This is great for the civil service and for Wall St.  But it sucks for those in manufacturing jobs, as they cannot compete when the currency is artificially priced so high.<p>4)  Griggs Supreme Court case.  The Griggs case basically banned the use of IQ tests by employers.  So now bright young kids must spend lots of money on a 4 year long IQ test proxy, rather than getting a job directly.<p>5)  Taxes.  Overall tax burden has increased enormously since the early 1900's, even on the working classes.  The working class has by no means received a corresponding increase in benefits.  For example, poor people must now pay heavy education taxes.  This is despite that after seventy years of massively increased taxes and longer hours at school, rates of vocab and numeracy have been <i>flat</i> (<a href=""http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/does-education-really-make-you-smarter-349"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/does-education-really-...</a> ).  The ROI on this education spending was zero.  Yet we all continue to pay. Worse, progressive judges in the 1970 eliminated the ability of teachers to effectively discipline students.  Now are schools have become Lord of the Flies hell holes, with the inner city schools being the worst.  Taxes on the rich are bad for the poor too, if the government does not use the money any more effectively than the rich do ( as is often the case).  The rich often invest in charity ( like Rockefeller, Carnegie, Gates or Buffet), or reinvest in companies and growth ( like Paul Graham or Marc Andressen).  Either way, it increases the prosperity of the nation much more than government spending has.<p>6)  Lax crime policies of the late 60's were primarily responsible for the dramatic increase in crime.  This crime hit poor people the worst.  It also drove the middle class, and the jobs, out of the inner cities.<p>7)  Immigration.  Whatever the other merits of immigration may be, it no doubt drives down the price of low skilled labor.  Thus it is bad from the point of view of the American poor and working class.<p>8) Democracy promotion abroad.  The U.S. has had the insane idea that simply by forcing elections in countries with 20% literacy rates, no judicial system, no institutions, no heritage of civic participation, and highly combustible tribal relations, that these countries would magically turn  into replicas of America.  In reality, the result has been civil war, coups, bad government, and corruption.  U.S. imposed anti-imperialism and democracy promotion has been an <i>unmitigated disaster</i> for the third world.

I realize that your mind is made up, and since I'm (finally) starting to learn how hard it is to change a mindset, I'm not even going to try to change yours.  I actually agree with much of what you're saying, and we can agree to disagree on the few other parts.<p>As I said before, I invested in this industry because I hated it and because I thought the incentives were misaligned.  I definitely have a different background than any other agents or brokers I know, which puts me at odds with most of them.  That being said, I think there IS a role for a (much smaller number) of good, honest real estate agents if the incentives are realigned and consumers can be made to understand more of the process and what they're actually paying for.  As with any industry, SOME intermediaries do create value.  To think that no intermediaries create value is, in many ways, just as ignorant as trusting agents too much and paying the 6% ""like everyone else does.""  I just want consumers to be able to separate those that do create value from those that don't, and to pay a fair price for the value they receive.  Those seemingly small goals will probably not happen industry-wide in my lifetime the way things are going, but I'm slowly working on it...<p>I initially tried a more revolutionary attack on the real estate industry (and MLS), and was severely beaten by the experience just like so many that came before me.  One of the main obstacles is the entrenched players in the industry and their power over the regulations, etc.  Even more powerful and disturbing, for me anyway, is that most consumers simply don't care if the industry changes because they don't even understand financial basics.  Most alternatives to the status quo fail because of consumer inertia, not competitors.<p>I think the industry WILL change, but not die.  I've looked at where I think the industry is going, and right now I'm satisfied to educate consumers and to save them a substantial amount of money.  A website can't replace an agent in all cases, on either the buy-side or the sell-side.  Of course, in some cases, it can. I believe my company is doing better work by operating in the customer's interest on the leading edge of the industry, versus working on an idealized version of where we or others might WANT it to go.  This is probably the least lucrative company I'm involved with, but it is very satisfying when some people do get it and we can help them out.",1242878601

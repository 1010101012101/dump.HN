I've read quite a few threads on HN and respect this as a news source, and I haven't felt fit to contribute until now.<p>I've been talking with Julie about her experiences as a like-minded professional and I also remain baffled why her extremely sensible business plan continues to //receive tepid interest// (EDIT: originally wrote ""go unfunded"" here but I'm speaking inaccurately and out-of-line) despite an aggressive half-year VC campaign while the most harebrained ideas in the world (founded by prep school dudes) seem to effortlessly accumulate resources provided by others... including free press from many of the news sources that get shared here frequently. I believe business leaders in our industry play favorites and manipulate us into believing their partners are somehow better and more deserving than the rest of us... and that it fattens their bottom line and increases their domination of the culture of this industry. I think more of us need to take a stand against this... if not just on principle, but because it's good business and certainly a better plan than the lengthy boom/bust cycles this VC ruling class keeps leading the rest of us through like lemmings, leading to capital shortages and employment drop-offs that starve families and stifle innovation.<p>So, let's use this as a forum to discuss what may or may not be wrong about this view of things.",1361127358

5236199,comment,5235992,5235992,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">As I've argued elsewhere, obscuring your login service via non-standard ports or even a requirement to try several ports in sequence really only buys you security equivalent to lengthening your password by two characters per port. After all, TCP and UDP port numbers are limited to 65536 distinct values, within the scope of a 16-bit value. Moving your service to a non-standard port means that the would-be intruder has to guess a two-byte value. Introducing a sequence of ports buys you the added obscurity of two bytes per port.<p>It needs to be pointed out that it is actually worse than that. Guessing a password is O(2^n) on the length of the password. Making the attacker guess a random m bit value before starting to guess passwords is O(2^m + 2^n). To put numbers behind this, a password with 32 bits of entropy has ~4 billion possible combinations, 16 bits of random port + 32 bits of password has 65536 + ~4 billion possible combinations (also known as ~4 billion), while a 34 bit password would have ~16 billion possible combinations.",1361126942

I've never done any Plan9 driver development, but my understanding is that Plan9 has userspace equivalents of most of the internal driver API calls, so that a driver module can almost seamlessly be developed as a userspace driver and then (if it turns out to be performance critical) run as an in-kernel module in production.<p>Once you've got good userspace APIs for the kernel APIs you need to use, then all kinds of rapid prototyping possibilities open up.",1361124822

To see if your IP address is listed in PBL, for the example IP address 192.0.2.200, do<p>dig 200.2.0.192.pbl.spamhaus.org<p>Here, the octets are reversed and prepended to pbl.  While you're doing this, you may as well also do<p>dig 200.2.0.192.zen.spamhaus.org<p>Again, replacing the above IP address with your own.  This checks the Zen list [1].<p>For a non-end user IP address you'll most likely need a datacenter machine, a business line, a VPS, or a machine hosted at a large organization.  A home Internet connection won't cut the mustard for mail.<p>Second, you'll need FCrDNS [2], or at least rDNS.  rDNS is just short for reverse DNS, which means having a PTR record in DNS for your IP address.  It could be anything, but something non-generic is best, such as mail.example.com, or puffy.example.com.  wireless-cust-0-200.example.com is generic and will score ""bad"" points on some remote systems.<p>It's best if you can do FCrDNS, which is trivial.  All that entails is matching PTR/A records.<p>This is all you need for Gmail or any other serious mail provider to accept your mail.  Unfortunately it makes self-hosting from home more difficult, but the upside is a huge reduction in spam.<p>Last thing, you should check <a href=""http://dnsbl.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnsbl.info</a> or a similar site to see if your mail server's IP address is listed in any DNSBLs.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/</a>

When we were first starting out, we used a lot of these services and they were absolutely instrumental to get us going, allowing us to focus on what mattered at the time.<p>But the more we developed our rhythm and workflow, the more we started constantly running up against small idiosyncrasies with each service that we were powerless to fix (we always submitted feedback, sometimes they'd implement our idea, sometimes they wouldn't). Maybe this app had an awesome interface, but their status labels were odd given the usual workflow. Maybe this other app was perfect in every way but had no API to allow us to tie it into the rest of our process.<p>Anyway, we started switching from services to open-source products, which really allowed us to take our process to the next level and optimize everything specifically for our flow.<p>For example (<i>italics are open-source</i>):<p>---------------------<p>Project Management:<p>Email => Basecamp => Pivotal => <i>Redmine</i> (and tried Asana but went back to Redmine)<p>---------------------<p>Issue Tracking:<p>Email => Github Issues => <i>Redmine</i><p>---------------------<p>Continuous Integration:<p><i>CruiseControl</i> => <i>Integrity</i> => TDDium (<a href=""https://www.tddium.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tddium.com</a>) / Semaphore (<a href=""https://semaphoreapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://semaphoreapp.com</a>)<p>---------------------<p>Error/Exception Tracking:<p>ExceptionNotifier => Airbrake => <i>Errbit</i><p>---------------------<p>Time Tracking & Invoicing:<p>Harvest => Cashboard (<a href=""http://www.cashboardapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cashboardapp.com</a>)<p>---------------------<p>Group Chat:<p>Campfire => [currently looking into] <i>Kandan</i><p>---------------------<p>Code Collaboration:<p><i>Self-hosted SVN</i> => Unfuddle => Github<p>---------------------<p>Design Collaboration:<p>Pixelapse => ConceptShare<p>---------------------<p>You'll notice the only non-open-source services we still use are Github, Cashboard, TDDium/Semaphore, and ConceptShare. For the open-source services, we're able to host most of them on Heroku and rarely ever have to worry about maintaining them, other than security patches and whatnot. And we've been able to do some pretty cool things internally as far as connecting the different apps, since we have control over the APIs and underlying code, allowing us to add and change as needed.<p>You'll also notice that for CI, we actually went in the opposite direction from open-source to service-based. I have an entire writeup (not yet published) on why I actually found CI to work best for us as a 3rd-party service.",1361124621

If IQ testing were purely scientific (as opposed to being partly political), all those involved in IQ testing would allow a large set of test scores in a standardized test to produce the mean and sigma values on which everyone would need to agree. In other words, an empirical outcome.<p>> I'm not entirely sure what you think I'm arguing, but so far you've been talking about something quite different the entire time.<p>Apparently so. My point is that IQ test scores must be collected on an absolute scale based on testing results, before any of the adjustments you're describing. If this weren't the case, if test outcomes depended on something other than the direct performance of the subjects measured in a uniform, reliable way, the testing procedure would be fatally undermined.<p>Bottom line: I doubt that changes in mean and sigma can produce two different IQ scores in a standardized test as you're claiming. For this to be true, the relationship between the population statistics and the analysis result (mean, sigma) would have to be reversed -- it would put the cart before the horse.<p>Imagine this conversation:<p>Q. How do the statistical results derive from the test scores?<p>A. By a straightforward procedure -- the test scores are subjected to a classical statistical analysis, resulting in a mean and standard deviation.<p>Q. How are the original test scores arrived at?<p>A. They're derived from (a) the test results, but (b) adjusted by the the mean and standard deviation values of the population created above.<p>Q. (after a long pause) But ... but ... doesn't that create an example of circular reasoning, in which the scores rely on the stats and the stats rely on the scores?<p>A. What? I'm not following you. Can you draw a picture?<p>Q. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ovRvYQE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ovRvYQE.jpg</a><p>A. Okay, I get it.

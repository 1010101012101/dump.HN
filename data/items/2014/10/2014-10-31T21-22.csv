8541307,comment,8540845,8541267,0,0,maratd,,,"> Wages rise in bigger cities, too, but not as fast as housing prices.<p>If you want to lower housing prices, get rid of rent control policies and ease up on the zoning. Developers will create more housing units and you&#x27;ll see a substantial increase in supply, leading to a lowering of the price level.<p>The problem is that those already living in the city don&#x27;t want this. They are against new development and they&#x27;re all for rent control. They want to continue paying artificially low prices, while keeping anyone else who may want to live there out.

Speaking just for myself, I moved from a mainly-driving area to a small urban center residence some years back, and the walking aspect was great. I mean, walking to the library for the first time, I almost cried tears of joy.<p>At my previous residence going to the library meant a ten-minute drive, which wasn&#x27;t so bad, and now it was a three-minute walk. (Interestingly I just realized that I usually lived about a ten-minute drive from the libraries near where I lived, back in Japan) I guess I could say I felt more liberated, almost like I was part-owner of the downtown space, and it was no longer a destination that I felt I had to plan to visit. The car no longer felt so necessary-though I still used it--and riding my bicycle felt like more of a natural fit.",1414792705

He helped create the Mission Control organization at NASA.<p>&quot;Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work.<p>Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, ‘Dammit, stop!’ I don’t know what Thompson’s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.<p>From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: ‘Tough’ and ‘Competent.’ Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect.<p>When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write ‘Tough and Competent’ on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.&quot;<p>Video re-enactment by Gene Kranz: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zjAteaK9lM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zjAteaK9lM</a>",1414792596

8541287,comment,8539917,8541163,0,0,lsiebert,,,"I&#x27;m not sure who pays for them.  I think that paying for an assessment that actually tells you what you need to improve to get work might be useful for people.  I know there are plenty of people who either are too confident, or too insecure about their abilities. And if it&#x27;s a better assessment of ability then what HR currently uses, then isn&#x27;t that worth some of what a company pays for HR?<p>Probably it&#x27;s something that would need to be worked out by the market, hence my idea of one company that comes up with the assessment and then licenses it, and multiple licensees that use the assessment, experimenting with how to pay for it.<p>You could also assess existing employees, and figure out ways they could improve, or why one employee does better than others.  In fact that might be a good way to begin research, albeit with some clear biases based on existing hiring practices.<p>Also such assessments would arguably be less biased by things like unconscious sexism/racism, which could be useful for figuring out raises.<p>I don&#x27;t think that such tests would necessarily replace in house interviews.  The goal isn&#x27;t to create a perfect assessment, the goal would be to improve assessment.  Let another company do the equivalent of a phone screening.<p>As for generic tests... there are things that companies assess.  knowledge of big O for example.<p>Also such assessments could be used to assess more then individuals, things like the relative benefit of training programs.  And eventually you could assess particular assessments based on performance, so you could improve the testing itself.<p>It just seems silly to me to have every company do ad-hoc assessments on their own, when the whole industry could benefit by reducing inefficiencies.",1414792362

Initialization is always linear the number of objects unless it&#x27;s just not done, but generally speaking even in C or C++ you will still need to perform some kind of initialization on those elements. But really, this has nothing to do with the allocator, which is at a lower level.<p>Malloc is linear to the number of allocations. Automatic tracing garbage collectors are linear to the live set (because they tend to only explore live objects, and there are techniques to make disposing of the non-live objects happen in less than linear time[1]). This can really go either way as to which is better, depending on your allocation rate, which is why this is a point of contention.<p>But none of that has to do with how long it takes to initialize the objects.<p>[1] Semi-space and variants, which are usually used in the allocation-rate-heavy young or nursery generation.

There are also leftists who <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe that.<p>(The same is true, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, with libertarians vis-a-vis economic power by way of its divorce from control by formal political power in many modern states.)<p>> The position that the state has a complete monopoly on the use of force is an example of this.<p>The position that the State is <i>defined as</i> an entity that has a monopoly on the <i>legitimate</i> use of force is a concept which predates the existence of leftism as a distinct offshoot of classical liberalism (and probably predates classical liberalism as well.) This definition of what the State <i>is</i> is not an example of <i>anything</i> in <i>any</i> ideology, since its not a value statement.<p>Insofar as some leftists (though neither hardcore left libertarians nor communists in the vein of Marx and Engels, both of whom believe in the ultimate abolition of the State) hold that the existence of a State as so defined is desirable, this indicates that there are <i>limits</i> to how much those leftists believe that centralized political power should be limited by reducing the power of institutions instead of distributing control over institutions, but even that is different from demonstrating an absence of a belief in &quot;distributing political power at all&quot;.",1414791699

In which case, are these companies really going to hire and pay engineers competitively to be recruiters/evaluators? And even still, 1. their evaluation would only be for the specialization that was evaluated and 2. Depending on the amount of time spent evaluating, to predict a candidates average performance over time, through stressful times and through calm times, rather than just their perhaps peek or perhaps low performance over the stressful evaluation period, will be exceptionally hard.

8541111,comment,8538208,8538208,0,0,codeshaman,,,"Interesting that while the brain is interconnected the way it&#x27;s depicted in the article, people report having mystical experiences (eg see God), traveling vast distances through galaxies and strange worlds, see spirits of plants and objects, see themselves as a small insignificant part of the large organism that is Earth and at the same time, realise that they are immortal and that this life is one of an infinity of others and that they are God.
The larger the dose, the deeper the experience and I would speculate that the number of brain parts interconnected is even higher and the connecting lines even thiker.<p>Why is that ? What would happen if 100% of the brain would start exchanging information like this?
What if we could connect only the blue or green areas?<p>Psychedelics are the new unexplored frontier in science.<p>Imagine a technology (or drug) which allows selecting which networks in the brain to interconnect (temporarily). This could be used to design new mental abilities, train or enhance existing ones.<p>I&#x27;m really pleased that the taboo regarding these substances is slowly being lifted.

I agree that it&#x27;s bad and contributes to the confusion, but I&#x27;m not sure why Xbox can get away with &quot;Xbox 360&quot; or even &quot;Xbox One&quot; and have everyone know it&#x27;s a different thing, but &quot;Wii&quot; can&#x27;t do &quot;Wii U&quot;. I guess people just expect letters to be modified versions of the same thing, not incremental new releases.<p>I don&#x27;t think the issues with the GamePad&#x27;s usefulness turns people off too much. I agree that most games just use it as a mirror or inventory quick reference, but I think the GamePad is an overall minor part of a great system. Part of the marketing failure is making everyone think the GamePad is fundamental to gameplay instead of complementary and that the Wii U is some weird hybrid tablet-console thing. They&#x27;ve even failed to communicate this to some game developers who apparently feel like they <i>have</i> to make some contrived GamePad level.<p>I agree it was a somewhat slow start out of the gate with games, but at this point it should be selling like hot cakes.

Hiring is hard in early stages, less known, no time to dedicate on choosing candidates, fear of recruiting the wrong person etc.<p>Employees define the culture and a few key employees do change the scene for the startup at least on execution which is critical. Many of them might not be inclined or equipped to be CEO's but they are great contributors in the system. A relation/connection with the investor can easily convince these excellent talent to bet on less known startups at early stage.<p>Edit: rephrased",1283893181

Then you get more lift from one part of the rotor cycle and less from another.  That causes the plane of the rotors to tilt, and then the helicopter goes off in the appropriate direction.<p>For example, having more lift in the rear portion of the cycle and less in the front means the helicopter gets tipped forward, effectively like lifting one part of a plate.  The down-draft now has a significant rearwards component, so the rotors get pushed forward, taking the helicopter with it.<p>If you then change the cyclic to ""flat"" so there is identical lift everywhere, the weight of the helicopter dangling from the rotors causes it come come back upright (after swinging a bit)<p>It's a weird experience sitting in a helicopter when it's doing this, especially if you're mostly accustomed to ordinary aeroplanes.<p>I don't see any contradiction in any of this, and it really doesn't seem to have any bearing on the fact that contra-rotating disks have no net gyroscopic effect.",1283891422

I've salvaged C++ horrors that were virtually all basement code, intricate and fragile and dating back to Win16 code written in 1993.<p>Here's a recipe that may help you get started on your adventure:<p>1. Work incrementally. Never try to fix the whole program at once. Overhauling the whole program inevitably introduces lots of disruption for users and delays the addition of new features. This will not be appreciated.<p>2. Make sure you have tests. Lots and lots of tests. Any time you touch a module, write some tests for that module.<p>3. Build better module boundaries. This can be a mechanical process. For example, to separate disk I/O code out of a checkout register, declare a RegisterIO class. Every time the GUI code touches the disk, add a new method to the RegisterIO class and move the code there. You'll wind up with a _really_ ugly RegisterIO class containing a lot of ad hoc IO functions. But the RegisterIO class will improve with time.<p>4. Reimplement small modules one at a time. You may want to run the old and new versions of a module in parallel for a while (I once had a program with two different text rendering subsystems), or run the same unit tests against both the old the new module.<p>Eight years of work later, you'll have a reasonably shiny new program with some odd architectural decisions and a really ancient logging subsystem.:-) But at least you will have been shipping new versions and earning revenue every step of the way.",1283890930

Now I need to think about it a bit more.<p>Suppose we have a scalar field.<p>For Galilean relativity, a sphere expanding at a given speed will remain so after a boost, but will have a net velocity.  Densities will remain the same.  A moving source shouldn't matter -- any material will itself will set the rest-frame, and must to have a non-infinite propagation velocity.  Whereas, emitting particles, these will have the velocity of the source.  Ah! if it's a complex wave equation, you can put a varying phase on everything encoding the velocity.  But moving to a complex field is in some sense putting more degrees-of-freedom in.<p>For Einsteinian relativity, a sphere expanding at light speed remains a sphere in any reference frame, but the density along it changes.  A moving source should have that same pattern, so it would seem that local differences (i.e. derivatives) could ""point out"" the velocity of the source.  This behaves the same for particles being emitted.  Is there a first-order Lorentz invariant scalar wave-equation, or only second-order, using the d'Alembertian?  And that seems to introduce another degree-of-freedom as well.<p>I'm still really confused.  How do pions behave?

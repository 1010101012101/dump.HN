Your time and effort is going towards making someone else rich and their priorities are more important than your own.<p>I feel exactly the same. I&#x27;ve been in the game for nearly 8 years now, and it doesn&#x27;t get any better. At the end of the day, as you say work is work, I don&#x27;t think I would feel any better working in another career. I like programming, I just don&#x27;t really like working as a programmer :D<p>For the last two years I&#x27;ve been contracting which helps as I get to pick and choose projects a bit more, and if I get bored, contracts are only usually a couple months at a time so it&#x27;s easy to get out (&quot;I can&#x27;t renew, I&#x27;ve already got another contract&quot;). I&#x27;m focussing on saving to buy a small property outright with no mortgage, so once I am living there my living expenses will be greatly reduced and I&#x27;ll have more freedom to explore my interests outside of work.",1454313537

Compiling your own system from scratch without the aid of a distribution makes it easier to appreciate the automatic defaults that usually gets installed.<p>I personally do not want to be forced to know all the hazardously settings that exist in the kernel and base system. I want sane defaults, defaults that are set automatically when I install my Debian packages. If I disagree with an automatic default, my options are to either utilize the control (freedoms) that FOSS software provides, or issue a bug report and try get the community to agree with my views.<p>If &quot;rm -rf /&quot; is a valid use case/concern, send up a bug report.

I&#x27;m a little over 3 years into my career programming and I&#x27;ve just started at Google which has been a goal of mine for awhile. The challenge is pretty immense (in terms of having to learn so many new languages and pieces of tech) and the compensation is unbeatable. Years ago I never would have imagined I could make such a good life for myself programming.<p>I have also met some wonderful friends and intellectual peers through my programming jobs, and I&#x27;m even trying to write my own language now for laughs.

It has always been the case the price setter has assumed they were bigger than the market and it has always turned out the opposite. It is also because the market can stand the test of time. This combined with today&#x27;s use of leverage & derivatives is an even more dangerous combination.<p>Markets always assume the correct rate, because if not there is something that can be profited from.<p>None of what I say precipitates bias, I&#x27;m not against China&#x27;s rise. I even believe the GDP numbers out of China, as I mention in another comment on this page. This is just the basis of how markets work. The predicate of your assumption is the PBOC is bigger than the market for Yuan trade and this is incorrect. In something as liquid as a currency a counter party will always be available.",1454313416

With a large pre-existing C++ codebase you have a choice of writing SWIG wrappers, embarking on a quixotic task of rewriting core libraries natively in your language of choice or just going with the flow.

Now when you visit the site, google still can track you, because you make request to them.<p>The only weakness with this approach is that it only works for urls known to the author.

I&#x27;ve tried to transition out of consulting and into 100% product company, but have not so far been successful. There&#x27;s a significant short-term revenue hit in that.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of recurring product licencing and support revenue, but not enough to break me even, so it gets supplemented with consulting. And you know how lopsided that distribution is; 75% of the work for 45% of the revenue, or something like that.<p>Amidst that kind of schizophrenia, it&#x27;s very hard to hire someone, both for financial reasons and because the hiring decisions that would need to be made are very different in those cases.<p>3. I&#x27;ve hired numerous people over the years, back when I was doing consulting/project work full time and not engaged in this productisation effort.<p>The people I could afford were mostly entry-level. In the niche vertical I&#x27;m in as well as the high-expertise business model I&#x27;ve created for myself, customers expectations are specifically for domain knowledge and multifarious skill sets. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t scale out much beyond me and other folks exactly like me, so I couldn&#x27;t find ways to bill my employees out.<p>Being a conscientious person who largely blamed himself and chose to view it as an entrepreneurial & management failure on my part rather than on theirs, I kept them on far longer than I could afford to, effectively working 2-3x as hard to keep the lights on and subsidise their salaries.<p>Clearly, the solution is to hire non entry-level people. But the folks with the expertise to be able to do the work are definitely a high-salary proposition, and I can&#x27;t afford it.<p>4. Hiring is very much a question of cash flow.

I don&#x27;t think I want to talk about exactly why publicly while I&#x27;m still in this job, but to give you an idea of how bad the situation is, literally all of my friends have been trying to get me to quit for months, with the exception of people who have given up because they think I must be insane.<p>On the other hand, I have a decade of full-time experience and I&#x27;ve been happy for about seven out of ten years. All things considered, that&#x27;s not too bad. The other way to look at it is that I&#x27;ve had maybe five roles at one company, two another another, and one at a third, and I&#x27;d say four of those have been good. That&#x27;s only 4/8, but it&#x27;s possible to bail on bad roles and stay in good ones, which is how it&#x27;s worked out to being good 70% of the time. Considering how other folks I know feel about their job, I can&#x27;t complain about being happy 70% of the time.<p>In retrospect, some of my decisions have been really bad. If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d bail more quickly on bad roles and stay in good ones for longer.<p>My dumbest mistake was the time I was in an amazing position (great manager & team, really interesting & impactful work), except for two problems: an incredibly arrogant and disruptive person whose net productivity was close to zero who would derail all meetings and weird political shenanigans way above my pay grade. When I transferred, management offered to transfer the guy the guy to another team so I&#x27;d stay and I declined because I felt bad about the idea of kicking someone off the team.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard, the problematic dude ended up leaving the team later anyway, so not having him kicked off didn&#x27;t make any difference, and the political stuff resolved itself around the same time. The next role I ended up in was the worst job I&#x27;ve ever had. And the one after that is my current job, which is, well, at least it&#x27;s no the worst job I&#x27;ve ever had. Prior to leaving the amazing job, I thought that it was really easy to find great jobs, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to just go find another one. Turns out it&#x27;s not always so easy :-). If I hadn&#x27;t bailed on that and just fixed it, I&#x27;d be 4/6 and I could say I was happy with my job 80% of the time. Oh well, lesson learned. Looking back, I was incredibly lucky to get the roles that I did, but that same luck blinded me to the fact that it was luck and that there are some really bad jobs out there.",1454312537

The core language did not really change from 1998 to 2011 and that was showing. That said, I cannot really see what the complaint is about, since you can still program in C++ as if it&#x27;s C++98 or C++03.<p>(I share most common critiques of C++ and think Rust is probably its replacement.

I&#x27;m less than 3 years into my career, but I think I&#x27;ve worked for some of the best companies with great pay, benefits, environments, etc, including a tech giant and two startups. End of the day though, work is boring. Its always work. Your time and effort is going towards making someone else rich and their priorities are more important than your own.<p>The only things I really look forward to are vacations and events outside of work. Learning things is always exciting and sometimes its extremely rewarding getting a project (or even a feature) off the ground and seeing a company rise and beat projections. But then a few weeks later, its just back to work and nothings really different. Its a temporary victory at best, then expectations just get higher and more grind.<p>The best you can possibly hope for is enjoying the people you work with and getting a couple good exits. I&#x27;m never married to my work and I would be incredibly depressed if I allowed it to define me as a person. It pays the bills, and generally pretty well.<p>Even compensation wise, it peaks very early and probably won&#x27;t get most rich without a ton of luck. Its depressing to make comparisons, but 99.9% of developers will never make half of what a specialized MD or successful lawyer or someone in finance might make. Granted, the barrier to entry is much lower in CS (sometimes nearly nonexistent depending on the line of work).<p>edit: Reading some of the other comments made me realize how dissatisfied I am with this line of work. On average, the people really are incredibly boring, especially at large companies. It is true that it is dominated by men and many are socially awkward. Its even worse that I think being on a computer for so many hours a day for years at a time makes everyone a little less socially adept, at least compared to the sales folks who spend most of their days on the phone.

Consider the following Go code:<p><pre><code>   type Foo struct {\n       sortedSlice []Bar\n       // ....\n   }\n\n   func (f *Foo) sorted() []Bar {\n      return f.sortSlice // Outside world can break invariants.\n   }\n</code></pre>\nNow the outside world has access to internal state and can break invariants (make sortedSlice unsorted).

Suddenly, knowing from the signature what the ownership is and having the compiler fail on violations, looks pretty useful!<p>Tony Hoare once called the null pointer his one billion dollar mistake.

Wireless, of course, with something like WiDi.<p>You talk about the watch like it&#x27;s inherently got to have a slow CPU and short battery life.  But it&#x27;s the display that&#x27;s the single largest consumer of battery, and the CPU is relatively weak in an effort to compensate for that.  On top of that, a leather or plastic band is a complete waste of wrist real estate that could be put to use as batteries or sensors or anything else.<p>A device like that could be your watch, phone, tablet, laptop, TV, smarthome remote, fitness tracker, and wallet.  The wrist device shouldn&#x27;t be an accessory, everything else should be an accessory for the wrist device.<p>Your comments about cloud storage and data centers is no more relevant to this topic than it is in any other.  There&#x27;s nothing mutually exclusive about &quot;headless&quot; wrist computers and the cloud.  Obviously with a data connection, your wrist device would in fact be your always-present connection to that remote data center.",1454311481

I pulled most of the heavy-duty, hardcore all-nighters during my teenage years; I grew up writing C, and was hacking on socket code and compiling kernels when I was 12-16. So by the time I was 20, I was utterly burned out. Most of my peers discovered the crazy, hyper-caffinated, 24/7 techie life in university years, and still have a few years of this insanity left in them. I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m 30 now, and feel like I&#x27;ve been running on fumes ever since. I am still interested in software architecture at a conceptual level, of course, but suffer from immense fatigue at the keystroke-based deliverables aspect. It&#x27;s always a motivational struggle to write even a little code, with few exceptions. I procrastinate horrifically, because I find it tedious.<p>Some of it may be because my work entails dealing with fairly uninteresting and unexciting things, and some of it is the cash flow schizophrenia of constantly operating at the very margins of economic survival, but above all else, it&#x27;s just psychological, cognitive and physical fatigue. I&#x27;m also fairly extroverted and have always been interested in the social and political dimension of what I&#x27;m doing, but, through eight years of self-employment, have pigeonholed myself into a solipsistic role without a collective--rewarding to those who crave peace, quiet and code, but not at all catering to my particular reward centres. I love selling what I do, but the dreaded implementation of what I just sold is like pulling teeth. Deprived of a collective, recognition, the competitive aspect, and any sense of larger purpose, it&#x27;s a real challenge to get myself to work on code.<p>In retrospect, I probably would have been better off sticking it out in corporate America and tracking myself into technical management. However, I left the employment world at age 22 and decided to hole up in a business model where I&#x27;d be most economically rewarded if I could get myself to write more than a few lines a week.<p>I am deeply specialised in a niche vertical that can pay well, so one would think the money would keep me going (I can easily bill $250/hr for what I do), but it doesn&#x27;t. Some of that is a business and life problem, but some of it is that I just don&#x27;t care enough to pound code anymore at virtually any price--though, of course, that&#x27;s not to say that taking the bricks of economic stress that come with a bootstrapped eight-year consulting-turned-product death march off wouldn&#x27;t help.<p>I still do it, but it&#x27;s taken me five years to write a slightly half-assed software suite that an energetic and motivated programmer could have done in far, far less time.",1454310486

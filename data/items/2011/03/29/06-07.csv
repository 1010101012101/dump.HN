Mostly they concern the absence of recurring costs.<p>* How do you intend to pay for hangar space?<p>* What is the time between overhaul for the engine? My uneducated guess would put it at not more than 1000 hours, and quite possibly much less. When this is needed, how do you plan to pay for it?<p>* Generally, when something breaks (and it will) how will you pay to repair it?<p>* How do you plan to insure it? How much will this cost?<p>* How do you plan to hire mechanics to check the airworthiness of the plane? How frequently will this need to happen, and what will it cost?<p>These are all things that should be addressed from the start. As you do not address them, I get the sense that you have not properly considered just how staggeringly large these costs will be. Or are you just counting on nobody being able to get certification for it?<p>That said, I think it's vaguely doable if all you want is a non-flying display piece, though hangar costs still need to be addressed. Additionally, I personally am more inclined to give $10 to any of my local air museums which have more planes, now, than to give $10 so that I may someday be able to share a plane in Denver with 4999 other people.<p>P.S: If you do plan to pull it off, what variant are you planning to get? One of the twin-seat U variants to make training easier?",1301381177

2381682,comment,2381351,2381658,7,0,matthewslotkin,,,"I mean I'd hardly consider the original iPhone a minimum viable product.  Smart phones had been around for years, and what the iPhone did was redefine the smart phone.  I guess in some weird sense you could say that it was a minimum viable product for the future of other products that were like it, but you could say that for any product.  In general, I would definitely not typify Apple as a company that gets to the fight first, but rather one that changes the fight when it gets there.  That was true of the iPhone in the smart phone market, true of the iPod in the mp3 market, true of the iPad in the tablet market, and will likely be true of whatever special sauce Apple is planning for mobileme in the virtual locker market.  My point is that Apple is not a company that throws out a product into consumer space with the knowledge that it is incomplete and seeking tons of consumer feedback.  They release extremely polished products to a market, often with what I would argue is an unparalleled mastery of minimalism in their features (in terms of leaving a lot out of their products and only keeping in what they deem absolutely necessary to most users), which could be confused for minimum viability if you didn't know better.  I would suggest Google as a better example of a big company that often releases products with the intention of quickly updating them once they start getting feedback.  Facebook might be another less convincing example.",1301381126

2381667,comment,2380316,2380316,12,0,JacobAldridge,,,"The fatal flaw of this project, methinks and is especially relevant here on Startup (sorry, Hacker) News, is mixed interpretations about what a 'Startup' is.<p>On HN and in the broader tech community, a Startup is almost exclusively a tech-based, scalable, early stage business. It requires entrepreneurial skills.<p>In the broader business community, a startup is just an early stage business. That cafe around the corner from your server-filled garage? It's a startup. The guy who washes Zuckerburg's porsche? Startup.<p>So we see a site like 'Startup Britain' and, combined with the whole Silicon Roundabout push, think it's exclusively about our type of startup - tech entrepreneurs, and no doubt the government here wants more tech startups. But the government will gain maximum roi from this project by targeting the broader definitions of startups - ie, all, early business.<p>By going after all early businesses, unemployment is reduced (at least by the founders, and some of them will hire staff), tax bases will rise etc. I still feel this project has been a waste of time and money so far BUT claiming that 'startups' don't need advice on logos and renting offices and buying MSFT software until they've developed an MVP and a revenue stream misunderstands the fact that a vast majority of startups are the local hairdresser, estate agent, or handyman, not the next Google.<p>(See also the E-Myth for a basic explanation of how this confusion affects businesses down the track.)",1301380573

Also, the basic sciences are also lacking in many areas as well. Scientists know that basic science drives future innovation.

We weren&#x27;t able to identify why it fails dramatically on the plaintext test, but I suspect it&#x27;s a combination of the two unique characteristics of that test: the use of HTTP pipelining and higher client-side concurrency.  My guess is that the pipelining in particular is causing problems.",1372802397
5981023,comment,5973896,5978577,1,0,vacri,,,"<i>Again</i> you fail to understand what was going on at the time, falling back on pop-culture memes. France and the UK were both hastily remilitarising and were buying time. Everyone knew war was coming, but the UK and the French needed more time to prepare, and it wasn&#x27;t just the US that was suffering from economic depression in the 30s. They knew for 20 years that there would be another war - Marshal Foch said of the Treaty of Versailles &quot;This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years&quot;. He was only two months out.<p>I mean, come on. You have <i>just</i> said that Iraq was a war that &#x27;called for intervention&#x27;, but you say the same is not true of the Nazis? This is despite nearly 10 years of a steady exodus of Jews from Germany to the US and other countries? It&#x27;s not like no-one knew that the Nazis were oppressive, it&#x27;s just the depth that they would eventually get to that was unknown.<p><i>You can call that isolationism but it&#x27;s not like any of the European powers stuck their neck out when it wasn&#x27;t in their interests.</i><p>I never said the US should be faulted for isolationism, though it is odd you cheer both their early isolationism and their later interventionism. I said that you were mischaracterising what was going on and engaging in double-standards.<p>For example, given that the French were intervening <i>this year</i> in Mali, as &#x27;France&#x27; and not part of the UN, how does this stack up against your claim of &quot;Europeans don&#x27;t intervene in Africa and haven&#x27;t for 200 years&quot;? Where are the US ground troops intervening in Africa? The US navy, along with European ones, are intervening against the Somali pirates, but that&#x27;s to protect shipping, it&#x27;s not to help the people. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were some, but I&#x27;m unaware of any.<p><i>Look, all I&#x27;m trying to do is refute the idea that it&#x27;s somehow the responsibility of the US to step in and intervene whenever a war breaks out somewhere in the world.</i><p>The US bills itself as the &#x27;world cop&#x27;, which was exactly its rationale for invading Iraq. It&#x27;s natural for people to expect it to live up to its own rhetoric.",1372802370

I completely gave up on their Android app for that reason.

5981002,comment,5978088,5980876,2,0,electrichead,,,"The single biggest thing for me was the framework for deploying &quot;apps&quot; through azure. You can create webparts or other bits of functionality that can be reused but hosted externally on Azure. There is a self-hosted option where the URL is a generated one but has a trust setup already; but there is also the option to use your own azure hosting but you need configure the trust yourself. One other thing I liked is that there is no more need for a SharePoint Designer - there is a new method of designing sites that is way more configurable than in the past. You can configure almost everything, but as it always is, you will find that you need to do quite a bit of research on your own to get things 100%.<p>All in all though, it is a very solid offering from MS that nobody really talks about. One of the main pain points from the past is that everyone thought it was a CMS when really it was a document management system. Now it actually can be both.

Go let&#x27;s me fiddle around with the goroutines on my computer, but that&#x27;s it.  With Erlang, I can natively talk to the routines on any of the computers in my cluster.  Just prepend a function call with an IP address and I can call a function on a completely different computer.  While you could emulate this with XMLRPC or JSON, it&#x27;s not backed into the language and it&#x27;s not treated as a first class function the way it is in Erlang.<p>Also, Erlang&#x27;s basic libraries were built with hot code loading in mind.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to stop and restart your software just to fix a bug.  Now, I&#x27;ve seen discussion on how it&#x27;s possible to do this with Go, but Erlang keeps the idea so pervasive that almost every beginner&#x27;s guide include how to do it.

Because we love it when we see and hear each other laugh at silly things we watch together.<p>Of course this gets really tedious when we want to watch several short funny cat videos and have to count each time to be in sync - hence I got the idea to make a site to simplify this task.<p>My idea was to create a simple page with a field to paste your YouTube link and a button to share it with your friend. Once your friend joins in, you simply hit the play button and the video will automatically start for both of you (or everyone who you shared it with).<p>I even purchased a catchy domain name for it: sync.yt<p>My question: Are you interested in using such a site?

5980883,comment,5979766,5979766,20,0,neya,,,"An honest confession from someone inspired by these comparisons. I&#x27;ve been following these benchmarks very closely right from round one and ever since I&#x27;ve been waiting to see my favorite framework, Ruby on Rails perform decently to some extent. I waited till the last round to see some improvements and while I DID see some marginal improvements, it wasn&#x27;t as expected.<p>This then provoked me to do some basic math. Imagine a real world startup scenario wherein you need to your application to deliver API responses (JSON) or even ordinary HTTP responses. If you use a framework from the bottom of the list (like Rails), then you may be able to serve, say, &#x27;X&#x27; customers on your site using your application at a time. Now, if you use something from the top of the list, you may be able to serve roughly about 20 times (20X) more number of customers on a single server. This not only means less cost, it also means you can worry about scaling and stuff much much later than you would have to, unlike on a low performant framework.<p>For this reason, I decided to conduct an experiment for myself. Pick up a framework from the top of the benchmarks and experiment with the learning curve and the language. Well, after carefully evaluating, I decided JAVA wasn&#x27;t for me (too much of a beast). But Scala seemed to hit the sweet spot with excellent language (1 line of Scala = 10 lines of Java on an average) features along with the trust of the JVM.[1]<p>So, I chose Scala and started experimenting with it. I started with the play framework and was not fond of certain decisions that were made within the framework. Also, the play framework is nothing like Ruby on Rails (but it claims to be so) and was more of self-serve and also quite heavy for my taste. Hence, I went even farther up the list and chose Scalatra. Generally, framework selection is a matter of personal preference and each one should choose whatever aligns with their philosophy. For me, it was scalatra.<p>Frankly, I haven&#x27;t been able to ship out features at the speed at which I used to, with Rails, but there was something very important that I learnt too - Don&#x27;t get comfortable with full stack frameworks without understanding what goes underneath. Rails suddenly seemed like an enemy to me because it was doing everything so magically that I literally had NO IDEA until I had to implement them myself with Scalatra. For example, do you know what AES-GCM is? Do you know HOW the secure cookie store in Rails works? What algorithm it uses?? Do you know you have to change the secret pretty often??? Do you know how authentication in Rails (Devise) works??? Can you build it from scratch???? I knew none of these, until I had to implement them myself for my application on top of Scalatra. It was seriously a pain because for the first one week, I did absolutely nothing, in terms of progress with features. But later, I started loving this way of development rather than relying on &#x27;magic&#x27; frameworks. Now &#x27;magic&#x27; seems scary for me because I cannot actually see what&#x27;s happening underneath.<p>So, to cut a long story short, Should you choose the fastest framework? Or should you follow the &#x27;ship it first&#x27; policy with an average framework??<p>My advice - Start with a full stack framework, something like Rails or Django, but also in parallel, try to understand how every bit of your framework works and try to implement it into a micro framework based on something from the top of the benchmarks (like Go, Scala, etc.). Most importantly LEARN. Something new everyday! And slowly shift your development towards these high performant frameworks as and when you see fit.<p>This is just based on my experience :)<p>[1] 1 JVM = 10 Thins, Source: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/pcalcado/from-a-monolithic-ruby-on-rails-app-to-the-jvm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/pcalcado/from-a-monolithic-ruby-on...</a>",1372800758

5980792,comment,5977922,5979572,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>On the other hand, if you do web development work professionally (and I appreciate that you personally might not), you should seriously consider running at least the beta versions of browsers on a day-to-day basis, and consider testing in something even newer. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much more likely that a browser change/bug will regress your site for tens or hundreds of millions of users.</i><p>Again, I appreciate what you&#x27;re saying, and it seems a reasonable request. However, I think it&#x27;s unrealistic for a lot of developers.<p>For example, I work on multiple web-based projects in various capacities. Right now, just to test changes on one of my sites before releasing them, I run manual tests on about half a dozen desktop browsers and several mobile devices. (Automated testing is great, but there is only so far you can get with scripting, particularly when it comes to things like rendering glitches and responsiveness.)<p>If I put a change live on one of my sites, or worse, hand it over to a client or ship a web app embedded in network-enabled hardware, I shouldn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be constantly checking for blatant regressions in basic functionality every few weeks. In fact, I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have to, until the teams behind various popular browsers and plug-ins decided that the kind of major/minor/point releases the entire industry had been using successfully for decades weren&#x27;t sufficient and pushing out whatever was ready at an arbitrary six-weekly interval was a better idea.<p><i>As for the rapid release cycle, my feeling is that process dramatically decreases the bug count. It forces everyone to keep the code in a roughly shippable condition all the time, and provides early feedback if a problem is introduced.</i><p>That&#x27;s an admirable intent, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t always work in practice. For a vast and complicated piece of software like a modern web browser, slipping in an occasional regression in a corner case is all but inevitable, but there have been your-browser-doesn&#x27;t-work-at-all scale howlers that have been pushed out sometimes too.<p>I suspect what this really exposes is an over-reliance on automated tests and a false sense of security if all of the tests pass. With development at this kind of pace, and with the distributed and partly volunteer-led development model for these browsers, perhaps there just isn&#x27;t time for more comprehensive reviews and high-level planning/architectural work and so on, but there is a reason those things have value.<p>As for decreasing the bug count, I fear that what is actually happening is that there are so many now and the target moves so fast that many of us have just given up on reporting them. Certainly for our project bug trackers here, Chrome used to be worse by a factor of several for browser bug issues, but Firefox spiked after going to rapid releases and has held the dubious honour of being the worst major browser for quality more often than not since that time. Several of these projects use modern but mainstream features from HTML5 and CSS3, but I&#x27;m not talking about bleeding edge or obscure features here.<p><i>It is, however, unequivocally false that no one cares about the quality of browsers or that all the focus is on features.</i><p>Please notice that I was very careful not to claim that. I do, however, feel that as a matter of priorities, quality of implementation often takes a back seat to ticking feature boxes and to performance at the moment.<p>Again, this is based directly off our own bug trackers. I could have described canvas and SVG issues not far from the kind of things simonsarris mentioned earlier in this thread, for example, and others in CSS3 backgrounds and borders, CSS3 animation, HTML5 media elements, and so on. In contrast, while the pace of development for IE is slower, it has <i>far</i> fewer blunder-type issues in basic functionality these days, in our (obviously anecdotal) experience.<p>As a final comment, I&#x27;m interested in these W3C tests you&#x27;ve mentioned a couple of times. I had no knowledge of anything like that before this thread. If you can share some sort of authoritative/definitive link to how that works, I&#x27;d appreciate that, as it sounds like I should learn about it.",1372799835

This is why it&#x27;s used so commonly in benchmark that want to produce a single number.<p>Of course this very property is what makes geometric-mean-based benchmarks so gameable: a 20% speedup of an already-fast operation (say eliminating a single instruction) is worth as much for purposes of the benchmark as a 20% speedup in something that&#x27;s really slow.

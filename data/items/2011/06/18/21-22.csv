2669631,comment,2667486,2668272,2,0,Goladus,,,"I don't think he meant monetary value, he just meant value.<p>The gold in the plating on my headphone jack has intrinsic value to me, measured nebulously in its quality and reliability.  It has value to me, but it has no value to the market.  My demand for gold-plated headphone jacks is currently zero and my headphones will never be a part of market supply.  Supply/demand cancel out, so the market ignores me, and I ignore the market.  But the value is still there.<p>Intrinsic value can indirectly affect the market by increasing demand.  Obviously, at some point in the past, I had demand for a gold-plated headphone jack, and the market supplied it at a specific rate of exchange.<p>The question is, how does the value of intrinsic properties of gold, such as its ability to conduct electricity, compare to the value derived entirely from social factors, like its history as a medium of exchange and its current status as a trading commodity?<p>Social value is not intrinsic value, but it's still real value.  The fact that everyone agrees something has value means I can trade it.  We're getting extremely close to monetary value but not quite there yet.  In theory, the socially-determined value of a currency could be measured in the same abstract life-enhancement unit as real intrinsically-determined value, and this unit still doesn't have to be money.<p>Monetary value isn't necessary until you actually participate in the market.  And so I guess there is a couple of questions:<p>(a) If you could come up with a unit to measure all value, how does the intrinsic value of gold compare to the social value of gold?<p>(b) How does the intrinsic value of gold's effect on its market value compare to the social value of gold's effect on market value.",1308434328

2669618,comment,2669450,2669563,2,0,prodigal_erik,,,"In San Francisco, major bus routes are notoriously unreliable. It's not at all uncommon for one to just not show up, and the next one to literally be so full they can't let any more people on. There have been some complaints about the NJudah turning back before completing its run to the outer sunset, but light rail in the city is much more reliable overall.<p>As with other suburban sprawl, the valley doesn't have enough density to pull off good service. Buses are infrequent and you may have a long hike to and from the nearest stop. Caltrain is fast and very reliable (IMHO, even fewer delays than BART) if you happen to be travelling between a handful of city centers (some stations have housing nearby), though they haven't decided yet how much service to cut due to budget problems (the worst case was going to be 85 commuter-only).",1308433856

Maybe the shape of the 0.1m region wasn't important to whatever you had in mind, but then I'm really unsure what your point was since I'd already said I was assuming an area of 0.1m.<p>You can get very bright $500 business projectors. They aren't emitting laser light. If they were, they would have serious problems getting non-scary laser safety classifications. Part of that is because the rules governing laser safety classification are kinda paranoid. Part of it is because coherent light really is specially dangerous. (A 100W light bulb has a luminous efficiency of about 2.5%. A 2.5W laser is really, really, really dangerous.)<p>Anyway, you could do your eyes some serious damage with that $500 business projector.

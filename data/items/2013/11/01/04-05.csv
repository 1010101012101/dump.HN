6651730,comment,6649467,6650413,2,0,Bluestrike2,,,"Utilities such as electricity, sewage, and water are natural monopolies; mainly due to the significant capital costs involved with each, a sole competitor represents the most efficient long-run production costs. Though the capital costs are lower compared to the others you listed, most economists would also consider garbage collection to be a natural monopoly.<p>In each case, additional competitors would increase average total costs for services by lowering economies of scale. But there&#x27;s a far more significant characteristic: there&#x27;s no differentiation between services. Combined with their being natural monopolies, you have the primary reasons for their status as government-granted monopolies.<p>Broadband services, on the other hand, have seen an explosion in product differentiation. We&#x27;re using one word, but what we&#x27;re actually referring to are a variety of separate services with significant differences (speed, quality, manner of delivery, etc.) that offer different degrees of utility relative to each other. Whether a municipality grants exclusive or even just preferential rights to a provider, the end result is that the service provided is isolated from competitive forces outside the service region.<p>Even if Google Fiber is in the next town over and offering an indisputably better quality service (such as endless speed and a free magical Genie with every install, wishes included), it has no consequence on the service available in your town.<p>That&#x27;s one of the sticking points when you&#x27;re dealing with coercive monopolies. When you&#x27;re talking about other utilities, the negative consequences of that coercion (in an economic sense and not the pejorative) pale by comparison to the efficiencies stemming from lower production costs. The analysis for broadband, however, isn&#x27;t nearly as static.<p>Municipal broadband certainly isn&#x27;t a silver-bullet. Some have knocked their rollouts out of the park; others have bungled them. But dx4100 is missing the point by comparing municipal broadband to private firms. The status quo doesn&#x27;t consist of competitive markets; it&#x27;s a collection of non-contestable markets. When entry to the field is effectively closed with no competitive forces, municipal broadband and other alternative ideas represent some of the only real options available to us.<p>In other words, what a sad little fucked up situation we have on our hands.",1383279245

6651718,comment,6650344,6651649,2,0,glenra,,,"If there&#x27;s any contention at all, the state health agencies typically &quot;determine need&quot; by holding a <i>hearing</i> which gives an opportunity for &quot;the people in the community&quot; to weigh in.<p>The way that works in practice is that at the hearing any hospitals in the surrounding area that care to do so will have someone show up to testify that it would hurt their business (and is &quot;unneeded&quot;) to let a new place be built or expand near their area. The agency doesn&#x27;t HAVE to take their word for it but in practice tends to do so - after the hearing, a committee that heard one voice FOR the new place and five or ten voices OPPOSED to it decides that &quot;based on the weight of the testimony heard&quot; there&#x27;s no need for the new place. Unless a new lower-priced competitor can somehow generate the impression of a huge groundswell of support for the value of something new that <i>hasn&#x27;t even been built yet</i> and thus can&#x27;t sensibly be judged - in the face of really well-funded opposition - it never gets the chance to compete. So in practice, the status quo operations have a veto, even if the law doesn&#x27;t explicitly say that.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of an existing hospital requesting a need hearing so they can make their case to stop a potential competitor from getting some of their business:<p><a href=""http://wvuhealthcare.com/wvuh/Content/Media/News-Releases/2013/SEPT/WVU-Hospitals-requests-hearing-on-Mon-General-Cert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wvuhealthcare.com/wvuh/Content/Media/News-Releases/20...</a><p>And here&#x27;s an FAQ/description of the hearings:<p><a href=""http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/FacilitiesNewReneworUpdate/CertificateofNeed/PublicNotice/HearingFAQ.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/Facilit...</a><p>In most private sector businesses, if I think I can run you out of business by selling a lower priced product next door, I can just go ahead and DO that. There&#x27;s no hearing at which you get to testify that there&#x27;s insufficient NEED for my new restaurant/auto repair shop/what-have-you and thereby deny me a permit to build. Health care is <i>special</i> that way. In essence, hospitals belong to a government-maintained cartel.<p>UPDATE: in some states there do exist &quot;objective standards&quot; for what constitutes need...but it seems like what really matters is whether your Certificate Of Need application is UNCONTESTED (and might just sail right through committee) or is CONTESTED (so there&#x27;s a hearing in which a bunch of lawyers challenge your right to compete - and probably find against you). Where there exist official standards determining how much supply is allowed in a given area, they tend look kind of like the documents here:\n<a href=""http://www.tennessee.gov/hsda/con_standards.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tennessee.gov/hsda/con_standards.shtml</a><p>Note that if you use those exact standards, starting a new hospital in order to undercut existing ones and drive them out of business due to your better/cheaper service is basically impossible. For instance, you can&#x27;t start or expand a long-term care facility unless ALL the other facilities in your area have >85% annual bed utilization.",1383279102

It’s probably much easier and more reliable to measure the accumulation of single-base mutations (SNPs): DNA repair is faulty and such mutations accumulate with age. By comparing the genetic material of several cells across a sample this can be estimated.",1410350384

8296108,comment,8290283,8292785,2,0,tarruda,,,"> My proposal in the tracker was to allow such host-plugins to define the equivalent ex commands and viml functions instead of hardcoding them in neovim itself<p>Defining methods via msgpack-rpc and calling through vimscript is already possible(send_call will block until the connected plugin returns a response). Here&#x27;s what Neovim still needs:<p>- A way to spawn plugins through vimscript. This was fixed [here](<a href=""https://github.com/tarruda/neovim/commit/acf17dbefef379ecb8e8d95da0fb39d2d12acfc4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tarruda/neovim/commit/acf17dbefef379ecb8e...</a>) and will replace the initpython/initclipboard options. This alone will be enough to implement the golang proposal.<p>- Modify vimscript to enable definition of lower cased functions and commands, and commands that accept heredocs. This will let us move the knowledge about other languages/interpreters from the C core to vimscript, though it has the disadvantage of introducing  incompatibilities with vim in the future",1410350297

Another reason, is that Scott and his four died carrying his joke letter back (the both one rubbing in and proving that Amundsen arrived first.) Lastly, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s influenced by Amundsen taking almost the exact same route as Scott had previously announced.<p>At the time, I think he was seen as a heel that pretty effortlessly ended up as champion.

Its been 20+ yrs since I&#x27;ve sailed but for the landlubbers that means the sails are hanging off one side of the ship or hanging off the other side of the ship.<p>Tacking between them is quite hazardous you can get whacked in the head and knocked out and swept overboard or if lines are not handled correctly you could tangle a foot and get tossed overboard etc etc, and thats before operator dangers like improper line handling hurting you or rope burns or who knows how else you can get hurt while mode switching.  I suppose if you screw up the guying of the mast you could shatter it while tacking and that just isn&#x27;t good.<p>So yeah, to a landlubber, a sailboat that can only deploy sails to starboard is obviously a huge UI win because its modeless.  Of course that makes the boat uncontrollable and useless most of the time.  This is how sailboats would be designed if landlubber UI professionals designed sailboats.<p>If you&#x27;d like an EE analogy of modes, look at multimeters.  You&#x27;re not going to get away with selling dedicated ammeters or dedicated hardware voltmeters other than specialized apps (clamp on current meters, safety inspection high voltage voltmeters, thats about it).  People would rather switch modes than pay twice as much.

8296020,comment,8294539,8295748,34,0,omegant,,,"Sorry but you are wrong, it´s not a religious issue, it´s a clear IU mistake by Airbus.<p>I´m currently flying A-320, I´ve also flown B 737(300 and 800), and MD88. It´s true that at the beginning the new airbus received a lot of heat from pilots. After all they were trying to reinvent cockpits UI from 0. This led to a series of design accidents (due to initial design mistakes ) like the one on the article.<p>The initial idea it´s not bad: reducing weight (removing all mechanical and hydraulic controls), inventing the glass cockpit, simplified system management, etc..<p>It took over a decade to polish the cockpit (and the whole airplane, that had tons of electronics related failures all around) to it´s actual safe and workable state. Those issues, plus the idea that pilots had to readjust your whole idea of a cockpit, were the ones that created that opposition. The opossition it&#x27;s almost gone now, although in  general we pilots still prefer Boeing aircraft (at least in Europe). Airbus airplanes fly very nicely and are great too.<p>But now that we are used to the new IU, the concept problems are still there.<p>Main diference between flying normal fly controls and a moving auto-throttle and airbus fly-by-wire:<p>-Airbus throttle levers don´t move while the auto-thrust is changing the power setting. All the other airplanes as far as I know do it.<p>-Airbus side-sticks don´t move when the autopilot or the other pilot is giving an input. Also as somebody explained above, the inputs are added, you can end with a double (or zero input), if you forget to push the priority button (in stress situations like last second corrections to land it´s easy to forget it).<p>Why this is a mistake? because when flying a modern airliner you have an excess of information to process, all at once. A moving auto-throttle let´s you know what the engines are doing through your hands, without having to look at a tiny indicator at the instruments. Also it let´s you override the auto-throttle briefly because you need more power or less power at a given moment, without having to disconnect it. With airbus auto-thrust either the airplane or the pilot has the control, and you have to manually takeover. This may be dangerous at an approach that it´s already hard enough with cross winds or heavy rain.<p>The same apply to the side-stick. Normal autopilots move the fly controls at the cockpit while actuating them. This let´s you know what the autopilot it´s doing. And of course when a pilot it´s flying manually, the other pilot knows exactly what he is doing ALL THE TIME. He can slightly correct a maneuver without having to take over the controls from zero.<p>Airbus has wiped a layer of fundamental information available to the pilots, increasing the information overoosd through the vision. It´s the equivalent of driving a race car with a playstation control. Most of the time this information it´s not used(like in cruise), but you really, REALLY need it when things become hairy close to the ground. In fact I routinely disconnect the auto-thrust to land, with the Boeing and MD88 I kept it engaged.<p>Airbus knows this, but it´s too late to change 20 years of airplane development. They´ll need to change too many things (systems, procedures, certification, instruction), also right now it´s easy to change from flying let´s say a A320 to a A 330, due to having very similar cockpits and systems (that´s a great idea). The conversion course it´s short and relatively cheap. Changing the controls would make this fleet changes much more expensive and time consuming to Airlines.<p>Edit:  overall small changes to improve clarity.",1410348475

So yes, feature extraction from other domains should be on the horizon.<p>We are specifically trying to make it easy to say: I want to transform an image (or audio, etc.) using a pretrained net. Download the weights, extract the features for me, and give me the feature vectors so I can do something with those. This seems to be really, really, really hard in <i>all</i> the tools I have used and usually involves training yourself, which is not very useful for things on the level of ImageNet.<p>Of course, having nice examples and good docs is one of the great parts of scikit-learn, and is actually one of the things I have been working on most recently. Our docs aren&#x27;t to that level yet, but I hope they can be one day.<p>DeCAF (precursor to Caffe) and OverFeat binaries were really kind of the first in this regard (about 1 year ago now), but IMO one of the limitations is that they lose interaction with the rest of the Python ecosystem for data munging, and simple algorithms for exploration.  By wrapping the weights, we hope to leverage the support of the Python ML ecosystem easily, while still being able to use the power of these networks.<p>Right now the most compelling use case is as part of a scikit-learn pipeline i.e. make_pipeline(OverfeatTransformer, LinearSVC) or whatever. Feed images in, get predictions out.

If we can leverage their work, it would be a very nice way for people to immediately play with SOTA architectures in different applications.<p>In any case, just loading in weights and extracting image features easily is nice, and was a benefit for both Michael and myself in a research project this summer.",1410348424

8295989,comment,8295264,8295264,3,0,jdietrich,,,"A lot of detractors miss the fact that the Knowledge is about much more than just memorising routes.<p>The Knowledge is a very egalitarian way of hugely increasing the value of a taxi permit to the holder, creating a strong disincentive against any behaviour that might jeopardise their license. If you&#x27;ve spent four or five years working to get your Green Badge, you&#x27;ll think twice about cheating a passenger or taking liberties with traffic laws.<p>The exams (&quot;appearances&quot;) are conducted in person, and are deliberately intended to be highly stressful. Examiners want to see not only that the candidate knows the routes, but that they can remain calm and courteous under pressure. By design, the Knowledge is a long and arduous test of character that happens to impart practical skills.<p>If your interest has been piqued by this article, there is an excellent (albeit slightly dated) BBC documentary on the subject:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvFKh_3evC8&list=PL759B26B057F30955"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvFKh_3evC8&list=PL759B26B05...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007796l/modern-times-streetwise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007796l/modern-times-s...</a><p>It is also worth noting that the iconic black cab is a perfectly designed tool for the job, not just a kitsch symbol.

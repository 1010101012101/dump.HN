Optimization is inherently limiting -- your product will probably be completely different in three months, and you will most likely find yourself having to reverse or work-around unnecessary decisions that you made early on.  I know we did, and now our engineers probably curse my name for it.  It has probably cost us dozens of hours (and thousands of dollars).<p>""Developers acting on their own accord must be allowed to be inspired by their hopes and dreams and not always take the straightest path to the goal.""<p>If your goal is to make awesomely scalable software and learn a lot, then, yeah.  If your goal is to build a company, however, you should shed every non-essential and worry about potential problems when they're real problems.",1294592274

If they aren't interested in you yet, it's unreasonable to ask them to visit your LinkedIn profile, Facebook page, or even your personal portfolio without giving them something first.<p>My resume lists my relevant qualifications, experience, and then educational background, and if a recruiter decides after seeing this to do further research, I've included links to more information about me (LI, FB, and my personal site). The reasoning here is to decrease any friction on the employer's end. Make things easy for them when they are initially screening you by providing them with a 1-page resume, and make things easy for them when they want to do more research by providing the information to them.<p>Don't be lazy about it (recruiters can smell laziness from miles away), but LinkedIn does provide a resume printout pdf of your work experience, recommendations, and education. I would not recommend submitting this, but you can use LinkedIn as I do as sort of a 'Master Resume'. From there, I can pull the work experiences and recommendations that an employer would like to see the most.",1294592244

IBM Research did everything from semiconductor research to databases to virtual machines.  IBM was the hottest stock in the market in the 1960s, passing $600/share.

Searching with the old-school Google syntax is asking the question ""what documents contain these words X Y Z?"".<p>It's not that hard, in fact very easy, to wrap your head around that. It's easier than looking up a phonenumber in the phonebook, or a business in the Yellow Pages. It's even easier than using the term index in the back of a book.<p>While asking a question might be easier than that still, it also has disadvantages. It's impossible to ask an exact question on a very specific subject. Try it in real life. You'll find you need context, or at least a series of back and forth questions to arrive at the answer you want to have.<p>If a search engine would implement the same method, any advantage from using questions over a conjunction of terms is negated. People would get tired of typing long question phrases, and unless the natural language processing of the search engine is absolutely perfect, they'd get pretty frustrated quickly because the search engine would interpret some of the questions wrongly.<p>For simple queries like ""where can i find a recipe for blueberry pie?"" or ""what is the capital of Denmark?"", we already have seen search engines can do this pretty well. For anything more complicated, they fail sometimes, if not most of the time.<p>It's not that hard for people to search ""recipe blueberry pie"" or ""capital Denmark"" as you think, either. People can get used to barking commands like this quite easily. Look at Star Trek (""earl grey, hot"") or many other scifi series featuring a semi-intelligent computer. People almost expect it to communicate in terse phrases like that.<p>The big advantage, also for the layman, is that a conjunctive term query will nearly always yield the result they were expecting, because it doesn't leave much room for ambiguity. And if it does, it's when query terms hit a range of documents that weren't intended, but still match, again I refer to scifi, as well as fantasy, it may be frustrating, but it's also somewhat endearing (putting the user in a position of superiority) in the sense of an intelligent robot taking a request too literally. Or a genie in a bottle. Or an ET alien. Or commander Data. Or whatever.<p>On the other hand, if the computer interprets a full question in the wrong way, people get more annoyed, because the ""too literal"" explanation doesn't work here, after all, you typed a complete sentence, it should be obvious what you meant, right? So instead, people get the idea that the computer is simply not listening. And that makes it a lot harder to come up with a ""better"" question that would give them the answer they need.<p>Now, of course, as soon as search engines are able to do perfect language processing, as well as guessing a whole lot of additional clues from whatever bits of context they can get, typing questions into a search engine might be the better and easiest way. But natural language processing isn't really going there any time soon. Just look at the search engines that try this, how well they are doing now compared to how well they were doing 5 years ago, and there's not much progress made.<p>On the other hand, in the area of text-query processing, organising of data, cataloguing data, we have made tons and tons of progress. There's tagging, social network friends recommendation, and vastly superior methods of indexing large amounts of text documents for logical queries.",1294589108

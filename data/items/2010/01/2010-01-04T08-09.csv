Since I am over 30 now, it probably is a lot cheaper too - not only in terms of my hourly wage, but also if I multiply the odds of getting a lumbago with the costs of treating it.<p>I know moving is supposed to be the occasion where true friends are revealed, but doesn't it make too much sense to simply pay? Also, maybe true friends wouldn't ask their friends to help moving, if they could afford to hire movers?<p>As for charities, I admit I also have problems to donate or ""invest fairly"": it seems a ""fair price"" is probably the market price, to investing fairly seems alien indeed.

Usually you can avoid a legal fight by backing down and doing what the other side wants.<p>That said, still probably the correct course of action. They didn't have any real brand equity built up in Haystack, so moving on now means they don't run any risk of getting shut down later. More importantly, they've got a small team and no legal department, so making this not on the minds of their team is very valuable.<p>That said, Haystack was a very catchy name, and I don't dig on Sortfolio as much. Still a decent name and important to not run the risk and waste the brainpower of their team though. I like to think I'd have made the same decision, but I wonder if I'd have gone on an ego trip and gotten ready for war.

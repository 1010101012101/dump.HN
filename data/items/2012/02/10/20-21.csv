3577461,comment,3576604,3577189,2,0,evolvingstuff,,,"Agreed. To elaborate:<p><i>Saccades to an unexpected stimulus normally take about 200 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, and then last from about 20200 ms, depending on their amplitude (2030 ms is typical in language reading).</i><p>Saccades of 20ms in duration are ones that are very near to the current center of focus (e.g. moving to the next chunk of letters while reading the words of this sentence). This just means that detailed rendering needs to extend to a slightly larger radius, but this is still significantly cheaper to render than an field of view. For larger jumps there is ~200ms during which the computer can attempt to predict the final destination of the saccade, and thus begin to do some preemptive computations. Once the saccade lands at the new location, assuming a rendering speed of 100fps, there would be at most 10ms before the high-res version kicked in, but again, with some degree of preemptive/predictive computation, perhaps a slightly better version could be available immediately.",1328907588

For example, many, if not most, implementations of multiple inheritance rely on different values for the 'this' pointer depending on the type of 'this', where that type is somewhere up the inheritance graph. For a class C : public A, public B {}, the physical value of A * = new C and B * = new C will usually be different. The way this is often implemented is by having the addresses of the various vtables for different ancestors stored in the object data, and the conversion from the descendant class to one of the ancestor class returns an interior pointer to one of these vtable locations inside the object data.",1328907489

3577453,comment,3573694,3576408,1,0,gojomo,,,"I think some rats also benefit: their adventurousness and increased sexual activity isn't <i>always</i> penalized with death, and even when it is, <i>female rats prefer the infected male rats</i>. So even if they live fast and die young, they may leave more offspring.<p>Whether this is a net benefit at any one time probably depends on lots of things, and especially relative rat/predator populations. Just as human reproductive preferences seem to change in relation to wealth, population density, and life-expectancy.<p>Regarding semantics, I do think something can be both a symbiote and parasite. When I first learned of 'symbiosis' it was in the context of mutually-beneficial relationships, but it seems the term can be more general. Wikipedia says scientists sometimes disagree whether 'symbiosis' should only be used to describe 'mutualist' relationships (where both benefit) or also 'parasitic' (one benefits and other is harmed) and 'commensal' (one benefits and other neither harmed nor helped) relationships.<p>I should have used the word 'mutualist' in my above post, as that's what I was intending to imply. But the conjecture is intentionally fuzzy about whether the benefit is to the individual (it perhaps sometimes is) or the species (it perhaps always is, as long as both infection and non-infection are well-distributed).",1328907487

3577451,comment,3576734,3577332,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"I personally don't use Foursquare (or any other geo-location app or feature) primarily for privacy reasons. I'm pretty open about most things on the web, but my location is not something I want people know about.<p>That being said, I think socialized geo-location is a feature. Not an app. Clearly, there are a lot of people who disagree with that position and Foursquare is using it to create great value for people and businesses. Aside from mass adoption, Foursquare doesn't have a lot of market advantages that justify their continued success with their current business model. All it would take is some ""Me-too"" to provide a better experience in a stand-alone app (I can't think of any that have gotten adopted in the mainstream) or even bundle it with some other value proposition (ahem, Facebook and Path). There's nothing particularly compelling about what Foursquare is doing anymore (as far as I can see, though I'm open to enlightenment) that can't be recreated more easily or better.<p>I think they were in the right place at the right time and unless they shift their business model in the near future, I'll bet that during their market decline (within 3 years) they will be absorbed by some other company to include Foursquare as a feature in their own app.<p>Whether this is ""failure"" or not, that's a religious question that I'm not prepared to answer. It's certainly not the word I'd use.",1328907464

From what I've heard, the interviews at the companies there allow only recent CS grads from top tiered universities who have been programming for fun since 12 to succeed, let alone excel. After casually programming for the past few years, I'm pretty sure I could probably figure out Ruby basics and bang out some half decent web app/data analysis tools (which I'm planning to do if I switch careers in the near future). From the sounds of it, that's about what they're doing in this program. Does that make me hire worthy to any companies in the Bay Area? (Honest question)",1328906760

(-1 * a.) So, you could have -4^2 is 16 because the - would not associate to the nearest constant, but rather be part of the 4-value.<p>The reason for this is that -a^2 is super confusing, and I believe it should be treated as invalid.  I do <i>not</i> think that promoting the order of precedence of unary - is the best solution because it leads to the common confusion of thinking ""well, a is already negative, so there is nothing to do"".  if instead this was explicitly -1 * a ^ 2, then you can always ""plug and chug"" with simpler rules.<p>Essentially, the confusion is because unary negation is the only operation that is confuse-able with the value definition.<p>Final qualm against unary negation:  what does --4 evaluate to in ruby?  3?  No. 4.<p>If I had my way, then --4 would clearly be invalid because the inner -4 could not receive the unary negation.<p>In more programming stuff, I think that mixed-type operations should be illegal (no implicit casts!)  adding an int64 to an int32 and storing the result in an int32 should be a compiler error!",1328906593

I do have a couple of criticisms though.<p>The first criticism is perhaps more of literate programming, the concept, than this example.  I personally find it difficult to read when each line of code is disjointed by comments.  I guess I prefer the chunk size to be larger; a coarser granularity.<p>Some of these comments really seem unnecessary.  for example:<p><pre><code>  # Export `Cell`\n  _.defaults exports, {Cell}\n</code></pre>\nI think that is obvious enough that the code is ""exporting"" 'Cell'.  I couldn't tell you why though.<p>My second criticism is that it seems comments are all too often of the ""what"" variety.  Simply translating the code to english.  That's not really very helpful.  Once someone has some grasp of the programming language being used, the ""what"" is right there in the programming language.  No need to restate it in another language.<p>What <i>is</i> helpful is the ""why"" of a chunk of code.  I can read plain as day what it is doing.  But <i>why</i> is the code doing that?  Why was it written?  Why is it necessary to do this particular thing?  To me, at least, that seems much more helpful.<p>I feel my commenting has gotten much better since I started paying attention to when I was writing a ""what"" comment, caught myself, and wrote a ""why"" comment instead.",1328906413

Personality plays such a great role in the whole issue that I've begun to think that there is no way to fix education.  I think it is a hugely complicated issue and that positive results are local to a classroom and the personality of the students/teacher.",1328904327

The book ends with England in chaos. The book hints that a figure like V is always needed, no matter what kind of government you live under.<p>The movie V is an outlaw, but he's still more of a liberal reformer. He gets rid of the bad leaders, while leaving the state intact, and then gathers people together to witness a symbolic action. In the movie, it's clear that being V is only necessary when you have a bad government, then you can get on with your normal life.<p>Nevertheless, Moore believes that truly iconic characters take on a life of their own and become humanity's ""gods"". And in some ways the V-figure is evolving beyond the media portrayals. Not as prickly and disengaged from humanity as the book, while jettisoning the 9-11 truther nonsense of the movie. Maybe heading for true ""trickster god"" status; a friend of humanity that destroys structures that constrain natural developments.",1328904231

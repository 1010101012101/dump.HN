(Unless you can prove that the other car stopped with the intent to cause an accident.  Good luck with that.)",1243299505
626071,comment,625498,625505,0,0,Kadin,,,"Why wouldn't you?  Most laptop batteries -- with the exception of some of the most recent ones that use LiPo packs, or some very rare designs using prismatic cells -- are just plastic cases built around commodity cylindrical cells.<p>Here's a photo of the inside of a Dell:
<a href=""http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lithium-ion-battery1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lithium-ion-battery1.ht...</a><p>It's pretty trivial to build the charging circuit into the device and let the end user swap out the cells directly, but doing that gives up the obscene margins that manufacturers charge for replacement batteries, and (although I don't buy this as the actual reason) might conceivably lead to more damaged devices due to users swapping cells improperly, reversing the polarity, or mixing cell types.",1243299445
626070,comment,625818,625893,0,0,raintrees,,,"For me, taking SCUBA lessons are an example.  I spent the first, what, 10 lessons? getting to know the equipment, doing the math, etc. before we ever got close to the pool, let alone the ocean.  In return, after a few real dives, dealing with the equipment became a background process that I no longer focused on.  Instead, I focused on the experience (and my remaining air).<p>Same as operation of a car, especially a manual transmission.<p>Meditation, I'm told, is just the ability to reign the mind back in, as its focus wanders.  Which can eventually be redirected to bringing the mind back to the task at hand...<p>Ooh, look, new programming language...",1243299400
626068,comment,625742,625943,0,0,dgallagher,,,"My hunch is that computers won't suddenly outdo humans and overtake the working world.  Rather, I'd imagine that technology will meld with humans.  We'll eventually ""technologically-evolve"" into hybrid human-machines, eventually leading up into being completely machine.<p>Pieces of our bodies and minds will slowly be replaced with enhancements and superior components as technology evolves.  I have no idea what we'll end up as, but it's probably going to be different than what we are now.  Evolution didn't reach perfection when humans evolved.  There are plenty of area's that can be improved.<p>The beginnings of this are already happening.  Computers are an extension of our social existence.  Technology is getting closer to ""jacking in"" to the mind, Matrix-style (<a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/07/researcher-claims-to-read-thoughts-from-neuronal-activity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/07/researcher-claims-to-read...</a>).<p>So will there be a human vs. robot war, Skynet style?  I'd bet probably not.  Skynet turned on, became self-aware unintentionally (AI's one hell of a ""glitch"" to code up!), was plugged into the military, and did its thing instantly.<p>AI of that magnitude probably won't come-about suddenly.  Rather, gradually, like in evolution.  It'll probably be built into us as it evolves.  So if Skynet-level AI does develop, each human mind will probably already have its own copy running locally.  It'll be pretty tricky for 1 instance of Skynet to outsmart 10 billion other instances and take over the planet...",1243299015
626067,comment,625935,625935,0,0,patio11,,,"Interesting, but it seems to me that virtualization probably accomplishes all the goals, cheaper.<p>Instead of getting 100% of a cheap sipping server, get 12.5% of one that has economies of scale on manufacturing and operation.  (You can use the other 87.5% for other projects.  If you don't have enough projects to justify use of one full commodity server, you don't care about this discussion anyhow, but renting a VPS might work out for you.)",1243298997

And I think he’s right in this respect. The thing is, I don’t really see how this differs from many professions where the rich and elite are given heavy media coverage while everyone else toils away in obscurity.""<p>Maybe not, but it's a lot different than developing for the web or Facebook, where you can continuously iterate on your product, get better over time, attract a few loyal users and expand from there. The difference between iPhone and other software platforms is like the difference between trying to become a pop star or starting a software company.",1243298873

I actually had a CueCat, which read URLs in the form of barcodes.  It was a real bust.  I dont see the future they see in the article.  Reading UPC codes to get product information or price comparisons?  Sure.  2D codes to phone downloads?  It's seems so 20th century, compared to GPS based inquires and the like.",1243297859

Camino is the last remaining actively-developed non-XUL Gecko browser left (it predates FF!), and even they are pondering a switch to WebKit.<p>XUL is the only supported way to interface with Mozilla, and it's a monster -- you don't embed a view in your app, you embed your app in XUL!<p>I had previously written off Clutter as freetard foolishness, but Intel's Moblin project looks pretty fantastic -- miles better than the ubuntu or nokia projects, much less the bundled taiwanese crapware.<p>It might end up being the first XULRunner app that wouldn't be better off as a mediocre firefox extension.",1243296227
626045,comment,625342,625598,0,0,jlouis,,,"I don't think so. Most modern webapps or user interfaces strives for simplicity rather than just piling feature upon feature on top of each other. HN is a great example of this.<p>Efficiency can often be won by choosing the simple data structure or algorithm. There are numerous examples of the simple choice beating the complex one for all imaginable problem instances (although the advanced datastructure is faster in asymptotic behaviour). Another very important modern player is the cache. Simple and small often wins because it has better cache behaviour.<p>Note that I am not advocating for ""outright dumb"". ""Outright dumb"" is when your search of 100.000 elements is done via a linked list. Fortunately, such blunders can often be corrected with a bit of code that does not impair the readability of the whole thing.",1243296125

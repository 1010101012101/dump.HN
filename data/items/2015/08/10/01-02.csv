Meaning that overeating isn’t the cause of obesity, it’s an effect. If a room has a maximum occupancy of 20 people and the fire marshal gets upset and wants to know why it happened – you’re not going to say “well, it’s because more people came into the room than left.” Well duh, that’s what happened but that’s not the cause, the reason for the overcrowding. Rooms get overcrowded when more come in than leave and I get fat when I eat more than I burn; but that isn’t the cause.</i><p><a href=""https://www.thebairs.net/series/ketogenic-soylent/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thebairs.net/series/ketogenic-soylent/</a><p>We get the thermodynamic argument, really we do... but if you&#x27;re ignoring the metabolic effects of the insulin cycle upon weight gain in the modern diet, you&#x27;re not really grasping the important details.",1439171968

People (especially techies) <i>love</i> to ignore willpower. They&#x27;ll say, if you want to lose weight, just eat less. Completely ignoring the fact that &quot;just eat less&quot; is an enormous challenge for many people.<p>By calling into question the importance of calories, Coke is basically undermining people&#x27;s willpower, which is a precious resource even under optimal conditions. Promoting exercise as a substitute is useless. On its own, exercise will do nothing to help you lose weight, because the extra calorie burn will just make you hungrier!",1439171839

CombinatoryLogic? I can&#x27;t find any code here that would suggest you&#x27;re interfacing with a theorem prover, much less the incredibly amount of machinery that must be involved in taking two correctness proofs and producing a correctness proof for their combination.<p><i>> Then do not combine these things in the unsound ways. As simple as that.</i><p>I think this pretty much sums up the contribution here. It&#x27;s a framework that doesn&#x27;t face any problems with compositions <i>because you&#x27;ve chosen not to write down things that don&#x27;t compose well</i>.<p><i>> If the source language is sound, each of the target languages are sound, and all the transforms in between are sound, then the result is sound and robust.</i><p>To repeat myself once again, your framework doesn&#x27;t force <i>any</i> of these to be true. It&#x27;s just as easy to write down unsound things as to write down sound things. The fact that you <i>choose</i> to write down sound things is nice I guess, but it&#x27;s not a demonstration of the capacity of the framework or methodology to preserve soundness. It&#x27;s just a demonstration of your own capabilities... we hope.<p>That works fine and well when DSLs don&#x27;t get inter-leaved in unexpected ways and are only developed by a small set of developers. But then, we&#x27;ve known how to design DSLs in those cases for a long time. There&#x27;s no REAL composition going on -- just the sort of combination that&#x27;s always happened.<p>The actually interesting question is how to support an <i>open world</i> of DSLs. Where composing DSL1 with DSL2 won&#x27;t break some guarantee that the writer of DSL2 worked hard to achieve. And where even changes to DSLA, which DSL2 depends on, also won&#x27;t break those guarantees. And where the authors of all three languages never even know each other exist. And not just &quot;if you don&#x27;t write down the wrong thing&quot;, but &quot;because the framework prohibits it&quot;. You don&#x27;t solve this problem. In fact, I can&#x27;t even figure out how to <i>state</i> some specification of a DSL, much less that it&#x27;s preserved under a transformation...<p>Again, your framework might be a great setting for doing DSL engineering. And I don&#x27;t doubt that you designed a tool that&#x27;s useful for you. But you&#x27;re making some pretty extreme and apparently over-stated claims beyond &quot;nice framework solving a few practical implementation problems&quot;.<p>(Which is a shame because your tool seems nice, but your comments come across (to me) a bit snake-oily, so I&#x27;m not sure how seriously I should take the tool / approach. I think if you re-stated your claims so that they&#x27;re a more accurate representation of the problems you do (and don&#x27;t) solve, you might get a better reception.)",1439171755

10032259,comment,10030927,10032225,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Interesting. I do know that some BPUs can disable branch prediction if it fails a few times (to say, given i % 2 == 0, it would disable branch prediction on the third or fourth iteration). I wasn&#x27;t aware that they would actually go and find continuity in non-continuous branch behavior based on modulo alone, which isn&#x27;t that common.<p>So let&#x27;s run an experiment, shall we. Given Count = x.Length = 10000000 in C# (.NET, but the GC will never run):<p>Code:<p><pre><code>        for (var i = 0; i < Count; i += 1)\n          if (i % 2 == 0)\n            x[i] = 0;\n          else x[i] = 1;</code></pre>\nTime: 55-80 milliseconds<p>Now the same functionality in two non-branching loops:<p><pre><code>        for (var i = 0; i < Count; i += 2)\n          x[i] = 0;\n        for (var i = 1; i < Count; i += 2)\n          x[i] = 1;\n</code></pre>\nAbout 25-28 milliseconds. Now, to make it interesting, we do zero for the first half and one for the second half:<p><pre><code>        for (var i = 0; i < Count; i += 1)\n          if (i < Count / 2)\n            x[i] = 0;\n          else x[i] = 1;\n</code></pre>\n40-42 milliseconds. Definitely, a coherent branch is much faster than an incoherent one, while no branching wins the day as always. (ok, not true, see edit).<p>Edit: so I was probably running into some jitter problems. Running the tests 20 times gives me 41 for the first, 21 for the second, and 39 for the last. So the first and last are comparable in time. Sorry for the sloppy benchmarking!<p>Edit 2: so if I take the Count/2 out of the loop, my numbers for the third test become fast again: 42 for the first, 19 for the second, 26 for the third (average time milliseconds for doing the loops 10 times). The comparison is still hardly fair since I&#x27;m not lifting the modulo out of the first loop, however. If I use a boolean that is continuously negated instead the modulo, the results are 29 for the first, which is much closer to the third.",1439170530

It almost seems as though this new kind of &quot;DevOps&quot; (to use the same air-quoted term as you) is being used as a band-aid for companies to be able to accomplish traditional sysadmin goals, without having to pay for people with depth of knowledge. Things like Docker and cloud services make it easy to think that one does not need the knowledge a sysadmin needed to have ten years ago, but that&#x27;s not true. What&#x27;s happened is that applications like Docker have obscured the need for that knowledge by making things easier to accomplish. And then when those companies run into problems, nobody on the tech team knows how to put out the fire. Now, I suppose that&#x27;s not such a bad thing if you&#x27;re outsourcing all that work to a cloud services provider. Then it&#x27;s a matter of opening a support ticket. But then again, you&#x27;re at the mercy of those providers. I can see why Docker is so attractive for companies, which implies one can self-host these cloud services and save a ton of money, while also appearing to not need that raw knowledge because of ease-of-use provided by applications like Docker. It looks like an attractive way to cut down on quite a lot of cost. But what happens is that the cost is actually offloaded from needing the knowledge to build and maintain the infrastructure, and onto the moment of failure. And the thing about that cost offloading is that this cost could kill your business. Just picture a tech team with red status pages and buzzing phones, but without the knowledge to dissect what&#x27;s happening. It&#x27;s a ticking time bomb. Also I should mention I&#x27;m saying this as a huge, huge fan and user of Docker, but also as someone with twenty years in the industry, watching the &quot;new DevOps&quot; crowd.",1439169901

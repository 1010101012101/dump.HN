545896,comment,544828,545699,0,0,sho,,,"Oops, sorry for the faux pas - I thought that it had a capital T - and no idea why I wrote libraries either. I meant VM, or even better, implementation. Sorry, I was tired, and now I've wasted your time defending against something I didn't even mean to say. I was also trying to agree with you about the unreliability of specific benchmarks.<p>I'll try to restate. You said this:<p><i>""There are Lisp and Smalltalk VMs out there that are something like 70X as fast as Ruby 1.8!""</i><p>That is what I was trying to argue with. I have never seen any proof, beyond a few cherry-picked examples of Ruby at its worst and Smalltalk at its (presumable) best, where anything like a 70x speed difference is observable. On average, ST (is that ok?) seems to be a mere 5x as fast (or so), coming in at somewhere between 5 and 10 times slower than C.<p>Ruby 1.8 is in the average case around 30x slower than C. So if Smalltalk can be 70x faster than <i>that</i>, then it is generally twice as fast as C, on average, in everyday use. This is not the case, as far as I am aware. I see this ""Smalltalk is SO fast"" meme again and again but it just doesn't seem to be grounded in reality.<p>Sorry for my idiotic error earlier, and for sounding like a PHB ..",1238806442

You don't need much help from external libraries.  (Perhaps you need a compiler compiler, but that's about it.)  When you are writing a web app (or something similarly ""useful""), you aren't going to have much time to do your thing if you are reinventing an HTTP server, a request dispatcher, a component loader, an event handling system, a persistence layer, and so on.  The reason the author's C++, Java, and Python colleagues were getting more done than him is that they were all building things on top of each other's work.  The author was starting with nothing every time.<p>0 + 1 person's work is almost always going to be less than (everyone in the company's work) + 1 person's work.

Definitely - but let's also be clear that government influence through GSE's like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and poor government regulation played a central role in this.  Further, as for leverage, high corporate taxes give companies large incentives to borrow to fund growth.  What about the role the Fed played in keeping interest rates low and the credit bubble going?  Sorry, I really can't see how this summary can be considered even remotely ""good"".",1238804870

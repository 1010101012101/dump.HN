If you are a consultant, really a trifold brochure is far, far better than a resume and cover letter.<p>While I cannot guarantee response of any sort, to the very best of my ability I _will_ reply. If I don&#x27;t think we could possibly extend you an offer, I may be able to suggest someone else who could.<p>I won&#x27;t ask you to do any coding outside your interview.  I myself regard coding challenges as unpaid labor.  My decision to pursue this startup had a lot to do with my decision to boycott coding challenges.<p>Wish us luck: most new business fail within the first five years.",1371892596,1449189400

Funding is key as part of the success will be the marketing strategy which with second tier investors the site will be able to have 1 million subscribers within 7 days from official launch. Strategy in place to have the platforms generate instant returns with potential of USD 1 Million in the first year with projected revenue of around USD 1 Billion by year 6. Its not in competiton with twitter, facebook, foursquare etc. Our idea coners the smart phone and internet market but our focus on development is 70% mobile phone and 30% web. I feel we have come up with a strong idea for which there is a mayor market growing daily and have the right marketing plan in place. We have our whole strategy in place from starting up to first and second tier funding all the way to the exit strategy.

7092017,comment,7091260,7091260,4,0,vitovito,,,"Hi!  Researcher and designer for a US-based healthcare company, here.<p>To a layperson, this probably sounds awesome, but the red flags to me are:<p>- &quot;So I&#x27;ve came up with the design&quot;  Industrial design?  If so, are you an industrial designer who has worked on AEDs before?  Designing something that jumpstarts a heart that can be used by someone with no medical training is hard.  Software design?  Do you know what sort of hardware AEDs are built on and the software they already run?  Service design?  Are you mostly focused on the &quot;cloud server&quot; part?<p>- &quot;of this smart defibrillator&quot;  All defibrillators that go into business and homes (AEDs) are &quot;smart&quot; in the sense that they figure out your heart problem and then jumpstart you automatically.  What else is &quot;smart?&quot;<p>- &quot;that uploads&quot;  Many AEDs also require EM/RF shielding, and minimum distances from RF-generating equipment.  On-board GSM/3G/LTE/Wi-Fi hardware might be very difficult to accomplish.  Browsing around, I see one that has wireless transmission of log data... via IrDA.  I see another one with serial or USB ports.  So, this is something that may already be possible with a tethered computer with a cellular data connection, which makes me wonder, why isn&#x27;t already being done?  Is it because it&#x27;s not an actual need by EMTs/doctors/etc.?<p>- &quot;the patient data&quot;  What data?  The heartbeat readings that the defibrillator got that caused it to shock your heart?  Is there anything else?  Is that useful?<p>- &quot;to a cloud server&quot;  And suddenly you&#x27;re in the world of HIPAA and other patient privacy things.  Who has access to this data?  How?  Why?  For what?<p>- &quot;so that doctors have access to it&quot;  Unfortunately, &quot;doctors&quot; are not a homogenous group with identical privileges and information access, nor are hospitals all using identical hardware and software systems.  To require admitting nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, hospitalists, residents, etc., to access a data silo for a tiny snippet of information about a heartbeat from 30 minutes ago may not be worthwhile to anyone.  To integrate &quot;somehow&quot; with hospital software systems when they don&#x27;t have a record of you yet (because you haven&#x27;t arrived) and may never (because you aren&#x27;t formally admitted) will also be a challenge.<p>- &quot;even before the patient arrives&quot;  A doctor is probably treating patients who are already there.  They&#x27;re not just sitting around, waiting for an ambulance to roll up, at least not in the US.  They&#x27;ll look at your data eventually, maybe, probably.  Is there documented usefulness of old data in this case?<p>- &quot;at the hospital.&quot;  I may not be going to a hospital.  I may assume I am fine now that I&#x27;ve been resuscitated.  I may go to my GP first, three days later.  How does that affect usage?<p>But other than those things, it doesn&#x27;t really matter where you launch the product, Kickstarter or IndieGoGo or wherever, because with crowd-funding, it&#x27;s not really random people who fund your work.  You need a large enough social network yourself, already, to get something like 25%+ of the way there in your first 24-48 hours, to even have a chance of word spreading widely enough to get the rest of the way there.<p>So, assuming you have answers to all of the above, do you have a personally-reachable, financially-solvent-enough social network large enough to do that?",1390255138

In general when I’m reading a technical paper, it’s the same challenge. I’m trying to get into the author’s mind, trying to figure out what the concept is.

Based on the author&#x27;s experience and the example from Donald Knuth, it seems like the best way to read code is to go through it multiple times to the point where you could reimplement it or provide complete documentation for it.<p>The literary analog for code reading might be a writing a scholarly reader&#x27;s companion to a book.<p>You can&#x27;t write a secondary source for a work of literature by reading it once through like a drugstore thriller or romance. A literary analyst would read the book through completely >3 times and spend hours on certain key passages. They would take extensive notes reconstructing the innerworkings of the characters, the relationships between them, and key themes. Once the work has been comprehensively understood, the scholar can write out in an expository manner what is going on in the piece of literature, the same way that a thoroughly digested piece of software can be rewritten based on the mental model that develops as you read.<p>Obviously software and novels do not map completely one onto the other. I think the key similarity is that they both can be created with sufficient complexity to require taking multiple passes and following along with the author, building something similar yourself in order to truly understand them.",1390254756

At large scales it is quite difficult to get robustly efficient behavior out of a parallel system that is batching things on 5 second intervals if the data flow is anything but trivial.<p>For geospatial and graph analysis, Spark appears to retain the same limitation of Hadoop in that it cannot deal with data models and operations without an <i>a priori</i> optimal partitioning function.

Most folks aren&#x27;t aware of how drastically energy efficiency can save money for building owners and improve the built environment. It isn&#x27;t unusual, for example, for one apartment building in a development to consume 4x in utilities per square foot as the other similar buildings around it, without the owner of the buildings even realizing it (despite the fact that they&#x27;re paying the bills).<p>We&#x27;ve made excellent progress in this space, but better financing mechanisms for energy efficiency are still required as a next step. Even though the returns can be huge, building owners still need to get money to invest, and utility programs can&#x27;t keep pace with the level of demand.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how this effort progresses. Solar has been taking off in the US largely because of better financing mechanisms, and I think there&#x27;s ample opportunity for the same thing to happen in the efficiency sector.<p>I&#x27;d love to chat with you about what you&#x27;re doing at Spark, as I suspect there could be some areas for collaboration.

Both have their use cases, and I love Arch for desktops, but it&#x27;s not a particularly great match for situations where rapid, near-constant change is unwarranted, unnecessary, or problematic. Arch is also a distro that requires a fair amount of love and care--failure to do so, as a friend of mine learned last year when I had to help him update a year old install, can result in an upgrade path that&#x27;s nearly impossible. Fortunately, ARM was still up at the time.<p>There certainly is something to be said for stable distros with a strict upgrade path.<p>> I wonder if the advantages could have been accomplished without the binary file format.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll be honest: I can&#x27;t think of a time when I&#x27;ve actually made use of the filtering features of journalctl and systemd&#x27;s binary format. Nearly all circumstances that have required me to examine the log are usually done by observing the last few entries or manual searches. To that extent, I&#x27;d agree that it bears a certain sense of overkill.<p>That said, it is still possible to feed syslog-ng entries from systemd. So I can&#x27;t think of a reason to fret much over specific tooling or the likes that expects text logs.<p>IMO, the udev/systemd relationship, repo, etc. is probably a much more valid complaint, especially for distributions that aren&#x27;t planning on using systemd in the near future as it likely has some impact on developer/maintainer workload. Although from a sysadmin perspective, the benefits of systemd are very real and material, at least in my experience.<p>Service introspection could probably use some work to simplify, so that&#x27;s another complaint.

They&#x27;re just doing what they like and leaving a byproduct of doing so (links, social signals) that Google can use to tell you which sites people consider valuable.<p>But that means that once people realize what Google is using to rank, they can mimic those signals, and sway the algorithm in their favor. The problem Google is going to run into is that once spammers can closely (and at times programmatically) mimic what is happening &quot;organically,&quot; Google&#x27;s algorithms cannot tell the difference.<p>Right now Google&#x27;s approach seems to be ignoring or highly devaluing portions of the Internet that have been overrun with spam. Article submissions, blog comments, and now apparently guest posting, which sucks for people that do really high quality, organic guest posting; for Google that has to be collateral damage. Spammers will simply move on to the next portion of the Internet, mimicking what Google still uses as a ranking signal. It&#x27;s an endless battle.<p>One of the big things I see happening now is entire website hijackings (I&#x27;ve been meaning to email you about that, Matt). I did a quick little report on the search engine results for &quot;Viagra,&quot; and 81 of the top 100 are hijacked websites, including a client I have to upgrade to a newer version of Drupal, as the older one has been compromised. I don&#x27;t know if or how Google will win this battle, but it&#x27;s far from over. I honestly feel like the new way we gather data to rank websites, and what will be successful in 25 years, will have to be completely unrelated from what Google is doing now, and much harder to manipulate than spreading links all over the Internet.",1390253707

Whichever thread manages to grab the lock for being able to pick up an item is the winner, and actually gets the item. The world is modified so that the item no longer exists. When the other AI gets the lock and tries to pick up the item, it will get some kind of error letting it know that the item no longer exists. Or it can double-check for the existence of the item, and abort the pick up attempt before an error can be generated.<p>2) The other resolution I can think of is to have a queue of state updates. Basically, both AI broadcast to a queue that they wish to pick up an item. Whichever AI queues first, gets the item.

Scala for example can do specialization for primitive types and because the type-system is much stronger, coupled with an awesome collections library and pattern matching, the flow of the types is much better.

7091751,comment,7081405,7082672,1,0,ryanSrich,,,"Really? I mean consider this scenario.<p>A developer works for an agency that builds websites. The agency sells a job to a client for $150k (an average size job). The project entails building an application that can sort tasks a user inputs. These tasks have certain data associated with them that are automatically pulled in from a resource the client provides. So as a developer you&#x27;re thinking: &quot;ok I can use Rails as the back-end and Angular on the front-end because I know it works great for that type of interface sorting&quot;.<p>For the sake of this post let&#x27;s leave it as a high level example. From here the developer and a PM devote 10 hours to research the idea. A designer gets the client&#x27;s brand guidelines and spends roughly 10 hours putting together some style tiles for the client to look at. From here the designer and developer work on some wireframes together and have something useful after another 10 hours. After some back and forth between the client the small team of 3 has come to a conclusion on architecture and design style in just 40 hours of work. The designer then starts mocking up the design in flat HTML and the developer starts building the rails app. Fast forward 50 hours each plus 30 from the PM and we arrive at 170 hours total at the end of the project.<p>If we go back to our $150k figure and divide it by the 170 hours spent we should arrive roughly at $900/hour. If the developer makes $100k per year that&#x27;s $48.08 per hour. If the designer and PM both make $85k per year that&#x27;s $40.87/hour. Add those three up and we&#x27;ve got $129.82/hour. That means the cost of production is roughly 14% of the total cost of the project.<p>So in what world is six figures too high for a developer with these very relevant skills?",1390252132

And in a lot of ways it&#x27;s completely fair! Not many tools actually do anything that improve ROI, if anything they&#x27;re time and money pits.<p>Furthermore, Realtors don&#x27;t often trust people who aren&#x27;t because they don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; the problems they&#x27;re facing. Our CEO is a broker of 27 years, and I will say, without his insight into the industry we would be missing a big portion of the problems they face. Engineering isn&#x27;t the hard part, problem recognition is...<p>Real Estate is really for people already in the industry who are aware of what problem&#x27;s its facing.

I think there is a bit of nuance here that is missing in the discussion.<p>Should Wikipedia use a contextual bandit system? Assuming the cost is equivalent, I say yes, for the following reasons:<p>- they have a shedload of traffic, and then some; and<p>- they have a limited time in which the campaign is running.<p>Let&#x27;s address these in turn.<p>The regret bounds on contextual bandits are O(d sqrt(T)), where d is the dimensionality of the user profile you&#x27;re using and T is time (see e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3352</a>). In contrast, the standard stochastic bandit has regret bounds of O(log(T)), which is much tighter. The summary is you need a lot more data to explore the bigger range of possibilities you&#x27;ve created. So I&#x27;m not sure contextual bandits are viable for smaller sites, but Wikipedia definitely has the traffic to make them work.<p>If your test is running for a limited time you can just delete the code when you&#x27;re done. This has several advantages. People running A/B tests typically want to answer the question &quot;what is best?&quot; (To crush your enemies, obviously, but you can&#x27;t usually say that) under the assumption that you&#x27;ll then display the best variant forever. Contextual bandit algorithms don&#x27;t answer this question; instead they minimise regret (equivalently, making you the most money) which makes more sense in the limited time setting. In fact there is no &quot;best&quot; with a contextual bandit -- the best variant depends on the user profile. This means you need to run the algorithm forever: good if you&#x27;re collecting monthly subscriptions based on algorithm use, but bad if you&#x27;re trying to manage a site with an exploding number of variants under test that you can never delete.<p>Ob plug: If you&#x27;ve found this post interesting you should consider signing up for the bandit course I&#x27;m running: <a href=""http://noelwelsh.com/data/2013/08/16/free-bandit-course-draft-outline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noelwelsh.com/data/2013/08/16/free-bandit-course-draf...</a> It will cover contextual bandits, and a whole heap of other interesting stuff.",1390251693

Since so little software is packaged, you end up having to install most software manually, which means <i>you</i> become responsible for monitoring that software for security advisories and upgrading it in a timely manner when there&#x27;s an advisory.<p>Here&#x27;s my advice for a secure public-facing server: use Debian Stable, set up automatic upgrades every night, install <i>as much as possible</i> from the official Debian repository, and be sure to upgrade to the next Debian release before your current release loses security support.  This way, the Debian Security Team is responsible for monitoring security advisories and rebuilding packages instead of you having to do it yourself.<p>Source: I just finished transitioning to Debian after 10 years of Slackware use, in large part because I found it too difficult to keep my Slackware installations secure.",1390251673

I wear pants in public and particularly to work because that is what professionalism looks like in my industry and society.  When I&#x27;m at home, when nobody is paying attention to what I do, I kick off the pants and put on some gym shorts (even if I&#x27;m working from home).",1390251633

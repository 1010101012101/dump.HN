From:<a href=""http://ragoninstitute.org/hivcontrollers/patients/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ragoninstitute.org/hivcontrollers/patients/about/</a><p><pre><code>  Studies have also shown that people with higher viral loads are more likely to transmit HIV to others. Lower levels of virus are thus beneficial to the individual, because they predict longer AIDS-free survival, and to overall public health, because they may reduce the rate of transmission. Some HIV controllers are able to maintain levels of virus that are so low that they are termed “undetectable,” these individuals have been described in the literature as elite controllers or elite suppressors.\n</code></pre>\nHIV is already non-fatal due to antiretroviral therapies. So, this vaccine won&#x27;t necessarily result in an increase in the number of HIV+ people (who are alive). But even if it does, I still believe it&#x27;s better than no vaccine at all. Curing HIV (as in, eliminating it completely) from a controller is no harder than curing it in a non-controller. Right now both are impossible, but that may change.",1390528722

The purpose of the Path type is for safe and platform-agnostic path manipulation... but that&#x27;s really not necessary here. Say you provide a string containing an invalid filepath to the constructor to Path: you&#x27;re gonna get a runtime failure. This is the same failure mode that you&#x27;d get just by providing the string to File::open directly. So ideally the open function would allow you to provide either a Path or a string directly, without forcing you to jump through the hoop.

So sure, the future pipeline gets slimmed because of lowered expected returns.<p>There might even be further decreases to productivity of the research pipeline due to economies of scale (investigating one drug may make you stumble on a cure for something you weren&#x27;t even looking for).  Or there might be significant diminishing returns to more pharm industry research, because of the dependence on advances that only come through basic biology research.  So it is hard to say which outcome is optimal.<p>Nothing in economics says that the money generated through monopoly prices due to patents is an optimal amount for drug research and development.  And why chose 20-year patent terms rather than 30? Or 10?  It&#x27;s just kind of a system we&#x27;ve thrown together haphazardly.<p>Through NIH we fund more than half of drug research and basic biology research largely outside of the patent system.  India funds research as well that we take advantage of, and India provides the early education for a very significant proportion of our graduate-student/pharm-industry-researcher population.<p>In practice, any monopoly (which is what patents provide, though in reality upwards of 20% of pharm research is just wasted on researching patent workaround processes and drugs to break the monopolies of competitors, adding no new functionality) will try and price discriminate.  E.g. low-income people can get coupons for prescription drugs in the US and pay way less than high-income people, though it will be less relevant once we have near universal insurance coverage.<p>So, in the presence of patents and import/export restrictions/tariffs, the companies would end up charging much less on average per-pill in India and other low-wage countries than in the US in order to maximize profit.  This means that though we give India a subsidy, it doesn&#x27;t cost us much in lost revenue relative to the number of people in India who get a benefit.",1390526753

The BigCo advantage is that any decent salary will seem like a lot to people who&#x27;ve never had one before.<p>However, they are not the only players in the game, particularly recently. Y-Combinator itself started as a recognition of this paradox: while recent grads may be &quot;struggling&quot; to make rent (and in need of income), they are <i>good at struggling</i> (scrappy, risk-tolerant etc) and therefore ideally suited to starting a startup.<p>That said, I believe this particular lawsuit is more relevant to &quot;proven&quot; talent than students.<p>2. I think &quot;hackers&quot; will generally retain the &quot;hacker&quot; ethos, which I don&#x27;t think is particularly <i>tied</i> to how they behave as founders or executives. I don&#x27;t see &quot;hackers&quot; as any more or less benevolent or idealistic than the general population in the long run. In the short run, however, they are more likely to feel empathy since they were in the same shoes as their early employees more recently. From a more pragmatic standpoint, they realize more acutely that it will take a lot to get the best people to stay and contribute to <i>someone else&#x27;s</i> dream.<p>Finally until they are formidable enough to engage in strategic discourse with the likes of Google and Apple, they don&#x27;t have the ability to attempt such collusion.<p>3. Perhaps, but not necessarily. Acquihires might be a particularly good tool for talent discovery. There&#x27;s also the <i>potential threat</i> that acquihires represent (if you treat us (engineers) too badly we&#x27;ll just leave and you will have to buy us back 10x).<p>Your argument here is a good one, acquihires may reduce information available to all parties. However, this information asymmetry may work against the acquirer more than the acquired (or vice versa). I don&#x27;t think there is enough data to confirm either possibility.<p>4. It depends on what you mean by compensation. In many cases (not all), the work may be more interesting and more importantly you (may) have more freedom in choosing what to work on. I qualify these statements because to get all the way to this utopia you need to get tenure, which is hard.<p>Regardless, you get to work with the best and most interesting people, which is a form of compensation. Also, plenty of startups come out of academia simply because it&#x27;s like an extension of student life* (particularly grad students, post-docs and other non-tenured people).<p>* discussed in #1",1390525470

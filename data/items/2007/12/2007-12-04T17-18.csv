I get the impression that NetFlix, for instance, is a pretty good place to be a developer, because the company sees logistical software (for optimizing DVD delivery) as a critical components in winning against blockbuster (they also do video downloads, from what I've heard, but that's so close to an actual software product that I'm not sure I'd call it ""in-house"").  I gather that Amazon is also pretty innovative, but I don't know anyone who works there.<p>On rare occasion, product companies are clueless enough to treat their developers like typists - I've been at exactly one.  The difference, of course, is that these companies don't really last long.  A textiles company with crappy software management practices can survive anyway, whereas a product company with that attitude will almost certainly fail, and quickly.  <p>So in general, I agree - though there are some notable exceptions.

Just to give you a sense of what taking the exam is like, it has ten questions worth ten points each with the median exam taker scoring 0 or 1 point depending on the year. This was my favorite question from the first exam I took (partly because it was one of the few I felt like actually had a shot at getting right).",1196789898

Seriously, if you're not interested in building something to last, you might as well go into another fields such as financial derivatives or hedge fund trading.  As a consumer, I would be less inclined to do business with a company run by folks whose goal was to 'exiting' as quickly as possible.",1196789311

If you NEED to sell, then you will most likely accept any offer, no matter how bad, from the buyer.

Power users block them with AdBlock Plus, anyway, so if you cater to savvy users you'll get shit clickthrough rates and annoy everyone else.<p>Are people making $40-100k a year really too cheap to pay $9/month for something they use everyday?

85988,comment,85671,85751,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Web 2.0 sucks, I agree. Its suckage does not preclude bug tracker suckage, though. The GP had a point, which is that boring software is boring, and really, it would be better to read stuff about interesting software, by people who regularly write interesting software. There is interesting software floating around; the problem is, most of the people who write it don't have time to blog about it. They sometimes do write about it, but usually in that case it comes in the form of either patents or academic papers, both of which are unnecessarily hard to read. ",1196787982

there is a difference between making money and making money doing cool things. Joel makes moeney by doing really boring things really well. Web2.0 stuff makes me want to yawn. <p>The interesting future lies more in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, 3D graphics, Bioinformatics, and what not. Things which are not trivial to do and for which now slowly and steadily we have the computing power to make it happen on the standard desktops.<p>trying to make money using web2.0 type stuff is like lottery i think. There are so many people trying to do it.",1196787912

I have studied for exams and worked on long projects this way.<p>A former office mate and I would often run through all the options we had for coffee.  The coffee maker in our office and the beans my office mate ordered from Hawaii.  The sludge in the lounge coffee maker.  Walk down the hall to the department's espresso vending machine (which makes surprisingly good latte's).  The stand selling coffee and espresso one building over.  Or walk about a block to the two coffee shops across the street from each other (Starbuck's and a local place).<p>Is coffee culture taken to such extreme in other places, or is this a Pittsburgh thing?",1250099975

There was a credible coffee shop on the first floor, and the library allowed drinks. Free wi-fi. Desks. For meetings, we could book private study rooms for 1-2 hours on almost no notice.<p>The only real downside to the library was that you couldn't get on the phone during the day without going outside.<p>The nicest thing about the library is that it works well exactly up to the point where you need and can afford an office.<p>Unlike the coffee shops, which mostly lose out by being packed full of people who buy one cup of coffee per hour, the library basically exists for the purpose of providing a quiet space for knowledge work. You fund it with your taxes. Library architecture in most metro areas is excellent. You should work out of the library.",1250099905

758719,comment,758278,758282,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"My thoughts:
1. Like most people here I didn't really like to have to login to see anything, especially with the bait-and-switch approach. I think you either need to show a random result for people to see, or let them do a single search and log an IP address to something (difficult as I guess multiple people from one company can have same IP). Another option would be to show a reduced set of information maybe show 1 or 2 of the test results in full and all the rest just have the % without clarifying what is good and bad?<p>2. Site looks really nice. I like the blurb and the site makes me want to put a URL in and find out more<p>3. Personally I think it is pricey. I would have thought perhaps a per domain model or the like might work better - $10 to track a domain for a year - with alerts when it goes down or up in score etc? $20 a month might work for some design/development agencies because they can test loads of sites, but I think you are limiting to your target market majorly if you do that.<p>I've never heard of Amazon payments before so I'm pleased I took a look at your site - I learnt something! I think a lot of business people will prefer that over google and paypal etc.<p>Good luck!",1250099872

In addition JavaScript's asynchronous nature and the extensibility power that prototypes provide make it a very easy and useful language, capable of creating very impressive applications. If you add into the mix the fact that it's standardized, supported by a vast amount of documentation online and powerful frameworks, known by millions of developers, and backed by corporations such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft then it becomes hard to dismiss it as a 'not a good language to develop in.'

Users of the internet should be made aware of the stakes.

Your quality of life decreasing due to memory loss is enough of a concern to justify getting it checked out. Issues w/memory that I've experienced at different points in my life were related to diet, sleep deprivation and thyroid problems.<p>Are you experiencing any other issues? How's your mood stability? Do you get enough to eat/drink/sleep (7-9 hours) each day? Memory issues can be tied to a lot of issues, but some things may not be the root cause. Sleeping/eating disorders could be affecting your memory, but the disorders themselves could be caused by other underlying issues.<p>Personally, I had memory issues related to chronic sleep dep (driven by a ""sleep is for the weak"" mentality and a firm insistence for years that I only needed 4-5 hours a night). Getting onto a regular sleep cycle fixed the memory problems and a host of other issues. Having sleep deprived myself from age 14 to 25, the impact it had was incredible. I became much more creative & productive.<p>I started having sleep/memory issues again in the past year (along with mood issues and irregular appetite) with increasing frequency. I've got a currently undiagnosed (waiting on blood work) thyroid issue, but started taking synthetic thyroid hormone a few months back. The fact that it's resolved all problems points to hypothyroidism, so now I'm hunting down its cause.<p>Thyroid issues can be notoriously difficult to diagnose, since (I think) all tests could come back inconclusive/negative & most doctors use the TSH test to rule it out. The TSH test usually only reports thyroid issues in extreme cases, though, which is why there's a growing movement in medicine to educate doctors against using it as a thyroid litmus test. As my mom puts it (thyroid problems run deep and wide in our family), ""it pretty much just tells you if you're alive"".<p>If you suspect a thyroid issue, you'll want all thyroid blood tests run, especially thyroid antibody tests. If a doctor isn't willing to order them all, find another that will. I saw an endocrinologist who repeated incorrect thyroid information related to my test results that I've both read about and have been told about by my GP & a dermatologist friend of the family (both are excellent diagnosticians & doctors). I won't be seeing the endo again.<p>One thing that makes thyroid issues difficult to pin down is that it requires the patient to be knowledgeable & assertive about their own treatment in order to properly gauge their doctors. Here's a collection of links w/info on different thyroid aspects: <a href=""http://thyroid.about.com/od/gettestedanddiagnosed/Get_Tested_for_Thyroid_Disease_and_Properly_Diagnosed.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thyroid.about.com/od/gettestedanddiagnosed/Get_Tested...</a><p>Sorry to go a little offtopic on thyroid stuff. That little gland has plagued my family for generations, so I'm pretty adamant about pointing it out as a potential cause of things.",1326846379

(And there's often even better money in not helping them, but instead just making them feel special.) Plus, a lot of the benefit from particular practices depends on the existing code, the business conditions, and the people involved.<p>I think the right way to deal with Agile techniques is the same way one deals with new tools or new languages: try 'em for a while and see. E.g., I tried out TDD for a while and ended up liking it a lot. As does the rest of my team, such that they all were specifically looking for test-driven shops when I hired them.

To the extent users are aware of Wikipedia as a cohesive unit, they probably assumed that its highest value was to inform people, always working through controversies/technical-problems/legal-problems/etc. to achieve that goal. Wikipedia has been granted credibility via that understanding.<p>In a way, it's a bit like a doctor's duty, to treat even those they dislike. Or a lawyer's, to defend even criminals.<p>The blackout sends a message that, for at least 24 hours, lobbying on one topic is a higher duty than informing people about everything else.<p>Of course, as an entity sovereign over its own operations and property, Wikipedia has the ""power"" and right to do what it wants.<p>But Wikipedia has earned another dimension of ""power"" that's been freely granted to it by readers, based on their estimation of its mission. <i>That</i> power is somewhat conditional, and it's that power that even a well-intentioned blackout could be seen as abusing and undermining.<p>As of the day of the blackout, Wikipedia is no longer providing information like air, free to all. It's rationing information as power, to be withheld occasionally for political advantage.",1326845676

They all liked what they had done, but discovered they had commonalities that were worth talking about. They got together for a long weekend and came up with the Agile Manifesto (2001).<p>Having lived through the transition, I promise not all the good practices were ""well known and often used"". Frequent releases were generally considered dangerous, and weekly iterations were seen as heretical. Unit testing was done by a small number of projects, but mainly in safety-critical areas. Test-driven development was unheard of. Continuous integration was certainly rare, as was using refactoring (supported by high test coverage) as a way to manage change.<p>Personally, I think the Agile movement is irredeemably doomed at this point.

And Bootstrap's CSS file is nearly 2500 lines, unminified with a 47K minified file size. That's a lot of overhead if you only need grid, typography and pretty forms.<p>It makes a lot of sense to keep the full CSS file linked while iterating the design/layout, but once it's in production, the grid classes can be replaced with semantic names and the extraneous styles removed.

269382,comment,269151,269195,0,0,tptacek,,,"You probably want to be careful about how you word ""we've added HackerSafe"" to corporate customers. I will say the following things:<p>* ""Off-the-shelf"" scanner-based certifications are not held in uniformly high esteem by companies with IT security groups.<p>* HackerSafe just won the Pwnie award at Black Hat for ""Lamest Vendor Response"".<p>* Talking about how you have a security SDLC, code reviews, and secure architecture will offer much bigger warm fuzzies to customers.<p>Also, avoid blanket statements like ""so the data is secure"". Marketing 101. If you're going to invite objections, make sure they're objections you want to deal with, not ones where you'll eventually have to concede.",1218085175

If you blew air through a 4m x 4m radiator at 30 m/s, 43 megawatts would generate a 68 C temperature rise.<p>Those sort of energy densities aren't strange. A hair dryer dissipates 1000 watts in, say, 10 x 8 x 6 cm. So a cube of hair dryers 2.7 meters on a side generates about 43 megawatts.",1218084575

269374,comment,268633,268801,0,0,tjr,,,"After finally conceding the demise of the Commodore Amiga around 1996, I started using a mixture of Windows NT and GNU/Linux.  I loved the Unix way of doing things, especially for software development.<p>But I am not only a programmer; I also spend a lot of time doing music arrangements and production.  I hear that things have improved, but last I tried, music-related applications for GNU/Linux were fairly woeful.<p>I ended up getting a Mac in 2002, largely as an experiment, and have bought three more since then.  I would likely prefer GNU/Linux systems for software development, but MacOS is plenty adequate for my needs there, and I can run my music/sound applications.<p>I do think Macs look pretty spiffy, but when it gets right down to it, they just proved to be the best option for what I need my computer to do.  They might not be the best option for everyone, and that's okay too.",1218084115

I had one of those guys going door to door asking for donations, so I just told them I donated $2,300 to Obama already and they left me alone. I got rid of them within 1 minute, and they didn't feel awkward by trying to persuade someone to give when they don't want to.<p>I actually don't plan to vote this election, my state will go Democrat no matter what, so if I do go to throw my vote away, I'll just throw it to Liberterians.",1218082730

567603,comment,567278,567454,0,0,10ren,,,"I think it depends on how integrated vs. modular the business is.<p>Disruptive business ideas usually require many deals between different parties - there's the business integration, and the technical integration that you mention (as video ads become more common, technical and business standards will probably emerge, making it modular).<p>But some business ideas are more modular, in that customers can just slot the produce/service into an existing business role, and into an existing socket in their system. They are plug-compatible, in both senses.<p>This plug-compatibility also applies to partners. If you need to interact with content providers and hardware manufacturers (e.g. as Apple needed for the iPod and iTunes), some kind of Pond is essential, not just for access to those parties, but also access to helpers of the connection (e.g. lawyers who understand the issues in these kinds of deals). I think this is probably true whether you have a novel disruptive business, or just an ordinary one: if you need to make deals, a Pond makes things much easier.<p>But if you can modularize (systematize) your interactions with your ""partners"" to such an extent that they become ""customers"", you don't need to be in the same pond. An example is the ""partners"" of Google Adwords - there's a standard interface that people use all over the world, and it works well even though there's no customer service.<p>New ideas tend to not be modular - standardization comes later - so a Pond there.",1240000674

That's why there's a movement in the Ruby community to kill alias_method_chain for one.<p>Nor is this a problem that scales with community size.  There are bad programmers everywhere.  If using their libraries causes your project to explode, don't use their code.  Rails is fully admitted to be too clever for it's own good, which is why the push to Rails3 and cleaning out the kludges in the Rails code base is so important.  That's why the Merb project was getting so much attention in the first place.<p>Never the less, this is still about getting numerous different packages to work together.  It's a package dependency problem.  Granted Ruby's ability to reopen classes anywhere it likes makes this problem more difficult, but i hardly see this as an indictment of any use of the language.<p>So yes, package management is hard.

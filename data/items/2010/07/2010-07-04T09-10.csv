1485444,comment,1485322,1485322,0,0,bpourriahi,,,"Give yourself 6 months without any other goal but to learn everything you can about computer science, ad hoc, with a project in mind. I say this because it's demotivating and dis-empowering to be a position of no power, especially when you don't have a lot of cash parked. If you're a smart entrepreneur, I think you'll figure it out, and then you won't be a slave anymore. This may be overkill, but if you're passionate about what's possible in technology, you definitely won't regret building something yourself and giving it all you got.<p>Just one way to look at things.",1278236747

1485442,comment,1484149,1485170,0,0,mbateman,,,"I got it based on the number of active users, not registered users. Everyone who has registered for Skype ever counts as a registered user. I got my numbers here:<p><a href=""http://aaytch.com/borderless"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaytch.com/borderless</a><p>You're right that you can't tell when the iPhone will catch up purely based on those numbers. I'd say it's a smart bet, though, that it won't be long. We know that Apple has already sold a few million iPhone 4s, and I'll bet that it sells somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 million before the next iPhone comes out.<p>You're also right that you can Skype on the iPhone. We don't yet know how good Skype video chat will be on the iPhone, how it will compare to FaceTime, or how many people will use it instead of FaceTime. We also don't know who else (if anyone) will use the FaceTime protocol.<p>However, we do know that every iPhone 4 comes with FaceTime enabled, that it is trivial to use, and that it is integrated in the phone and contacts at the system level. All of this softens the significance of Skype's apparent head start.",1278236590
1485441,comment,1484308,1484489,0,0,aditya42,,,"Blame that on the time I posted the question (2 in the morning). But it's not FUD. This was just a question, not a statement. By irrevocably, I had a deeper meaning:<p>Android is shooting for share, and they will get it eventually, because of the number of devices it ships on. Once they have that, most (if not all) developers will follow. Missing APIs can be added, but users are hard to convert back — Apple and we know this from the PC vs. Mac days. My question was, has this shift already been set in motion fast enough that Apple will not be able to catch up.<p>(Of course, tech news on the Internet is very US centric, but those of us who are outside the US can see how non-existent Android is here. I haven't been able to factor in the whole ""Android for world domination"" theory just yet.)",1278236491

I have outsourced some development, and in the development of some ideas, taught myself to be a pretty sufficient programmer, just roll with it.<p>Your lack of technical ability is just one constraint of many that you will face, constraints are good, they shape your decisions.<p>And of course the benefit is that getting out their, with your hacked, outsourced, barely-holding together prototype, selling your ass off is going to go _along_ way in impressing those people with complimentary skill-sets that you might want to partner with.<p>Shit, if your a good entrepreneur, you will work it out as you go, learning, hiring and partnering with whoever you need.<p>As Mark Suster says, JFDI<p>And good luck",1278235973
1485432,comment,1485277,1485277,0,0,yewweitan,,,"A tome like SICP takes time to get through it, and I think it's more because of the way our brain functions more than anything else.<p>My strategy when working through the book was to slowly chip away at it, sometimes non-sequentially, and let the ideas slowly stick. When I say, non-sequentially, I mean to say that I would look at all the chapters, think about my current knowledge base, and then try to attack as many chapters at once.<p>Many will disagree with this style of learning, and the initial confusion lasts longer than I'd like, but eventually, all the thoughts just suddenly click.<p>That said, SiCP was a totally different beast, where the knowledge had to be accumulated and used throughout the book.<p>I think the most efficient way, would be to read each chapter multiple times first, trying to get key ideas (not everything) to stick.<p>Then proceed on to the problems, but set a time limit for each problem. Seriously, this book is so huge that one will never get all the problems done (i haven't, but that's part of the plan). Go search for some answers to easier questions, tackle those of roughly the same level of difficulty, then move on to more difficult questions, never obsessing over the fact that you couldn't solve a problem.<p>Because many of the ideas are one step removed from ""everyday programmer"", investing heavily (you be the judge) in the problems alone won't be worth it.<p>The best thing that I did however, was to ""leave some questions in the tank"" and re-read chapters at fixed intervals (say on every Monday), and attempt problems that I previously needed assistance to solve.<p>Oftentimes, I realise that I managed to solve it far more efficiently and with much cleaner code (and am constantly surprised by the difference in code quality compared side by side). Rewriting code in a different language also helps (eg: I'm doing Project Euler in python and Common Lisp)<p>Finally, I think you'll enjoy the journey much more if you pace yourself and give it at least a year to work it's magic.",1278235936

Or perhaps to the people who actually feel like they are a mess, and will identify with what he is saying?""<p>I have lots of problems, but I don't feel that I'm a mess. I'm overall quite happy. I still really appreciated the article, and it made me think that meditation might be a good thing for me regardless. There are certainly lots of things in my life that I could be better at dealing with, and probably some things that I'm not aware of.<p>And let's say that something terrible happens in my life. My family dies, I lose my job and get cancer. Would I be sad and unhappy? Probably. Would meditation help me in that situation? It might. Even though it wouldn't revive my family, get back my job or cure my cancer, it would perhaps help me deal with the situation in a better way.<p>If you spend your programming life never looking at your old code to see if you can improve it, always making the same mistakes and always getting a headache by supporting your old code, there's something you could do (code reviews, refactoring) - but you might not realize it or be motivated enough to do it. I think it's the same with the rest of your life.<p>That said, there is no point in spending all your time refactoring your code if you don't learn anything from it and if you're not shipping working code. And there's no point in meditating if you don't feel it has a positive impact on your life. :)",1278234770

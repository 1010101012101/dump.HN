According to them, whisky (and alcohol in general) is nasty stuff, and you drink it to get drunk. To which I always reply: why wouldn&#x27;t every strong drink consist of vodka, then?<p>As an alternative, cocktails had a small resurgence in the 90s that continues today. But most bars make their cocktails with different proportions and different ingredients. So not only could the number of possible cocktails reach infinity, but the number of possible locations to find a &#x27;well made&#x27; cocktail increases. If you want a good (or new) cocktail you&#x27;re always on a search for that new special drink.<p>It used to be that drinking the cheapest beer you could find in as high a quantity as you could find made for a fun night out [for young folk]. But new drinking establishments are tailor made to provide you a new product which costs more money, with the promise of a more sophisticated (or at least variable) flavor palette; the availability of flavored spirits in every bar and club shows how hard the industry works to try and gain new customers.<p>All of this comes at the same time that wine is probably as cheap as it has been in centuries. The increase in new markets such as China, Brazil and India have created a giant global marketplace for wine, which New World growers such as Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States have happily provided for. We&#x27;re awash in wine that is not just cheap, but tasty, too, growing the market even more.<p>We have more products than ever, more choice than ever, more customers than ever, more availability than ever, and a lower price than ever before. And they wonder why we drink more?",1446044278

At the time Palm&#x27;s website was horrendously bad security and usability wise.<p>While waiting for their website to accept my upload I was poking around and decided to see what I could get into. I found that the addresses were something like /user/<sequential id> so I wondered &quot;could I look at another user&#x27;s page by changing the ID? Na, no way that would work&quot;...but it did work. In fact I was able to see and theoretically control app submissions for all 500 developers at the time. This set of pages even included tax IDs.<p>So I immediately went to Palm and told them about the issue and how to reproduce. After about two weeks they finally reported that the issue was fixed...except it wasn&#x27;t. What they did was change the way the pages were accessed from a standard GET with the ID in the URL to using JavaScript to accomplish the same thing but kinda sorta hide the ID (so basically fetch content via JavaScript versus page loading via direct browsing). So naturally I was able to change the ID and still get in.<p>It would take them another month to finally fix this issue. I was never able to convince them to let developers know their tax IDs may have been exposed along with all of their other information.

I am honestly surprised at how happy I&#x27;ve been using Kotlin as the baseline server language for my current project (the backend of a fairly intricately orchestrated SaaS). I was not prepared to like it as much as I have; it&#x27;s still very, very Java, but it blunts the worst parts of it from a syntactic and, where it can, a semantic perspective. Like--List<T> is readonly, but retroactively applied to java.util.ArrayList, similar to IReadOnlyList<T> in .NET. It&#x27;s pretty nice. I am a Scala person, or I&#x27;d like to be but I find I write unmaintainable junk in it; Kotlin provides many of (though not all; I desperately want real traits, interfaces are not sufficient) the features from Scala that I <i>need</i>, without many of the negatives of Scala.<p>The biggest downsides I&#x27;ve encountered are around the deeper-magic Java interop, with stuff like Dropwizard&#x27;s HK2 dependency injection system getting a little messy--especially around non-nullable parameters--but that stuff is, all things considered, a small part of the application.",1446043784

Firstly, you should never outsource in order to save money. The author kind of assumes that is why you&#x27;re outsourcing. That doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The main reason to outsource should be to buy in expertise. Many companies do not really know how to document software requirements, or what a non-functional requirement is, or how to design user interfaces, or what makes good UX, or what a good test plan looks like, or how to run user acceptance testing.<p>Some companies don&#x27;t even realise that those things are important. They just think that if they just hire a few Ukrainian Java Devs, they will get good software out the other end.<p>Some dev shops don&#x27;t even realise that those things are important either. They just act as a middle man. Connecting you to the Ukrainian Java Devs.<p>Even if the customer does understand what&#x27;s involved in running a software project successfully, sometimes it just has no desire to employ developers. Maybe they are not the kind of company that can attract and retain good technical talent, maybe they just prefer to stick to what they do best. Either way, using a dev shop offers an attractive alternative to contractors because the team doesn&#x27;t disappear the moment you stop using them.

Your argument is fallacious because it sits on a false premise.<p>I do not think I got scammed by university (as the guy below me said), but rather was gifted by it.

You&#x27;re absolutely right that it needs disruption, specifically the &quot;buy here-pay here&quot; (BHPH) model.<p>BHPH sales are when people with no/terrible credit get an overpriced used car financed by the dealership where it was purchased at 29% interest and $300 bi-weekly payments (for example). The dealers bank on the fact that these people will probably default in a couple of months. Then, the dealer repossesses the vehicle (easily with starter interrupt and GPS devices), and then it can be resold at the exact same price (and the dealer can sue for deficiency balances owed by the previous owner if they so choose). The people who have to resort to this way of car buying are already desperate, and the BHPH dealers are designed to profit off of them.<p>The FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are slowly starting to catch on, but the lobbying by groups like the National Independent Auto Dealers Association is very strong -- they have A LOT of money, and they&#x27;re always looking for ways around the law.

Let me fix some of it:<p>This is true of outsourcing generally, not just outsourcing to lower cost offshore regions. Back in 2000 I left my secure dev job with a large US bank to join a startup and chase the dotcom boom with a startup.<p>The crash happened, I got laid off, no one was hiring, so I ended up joining a boutique &#x27;consultancy&#x27; doing dev for banks. Over the course of the next three years I learnt a brutal lesson in the consultancy development business model.<p>As this post points out, there&#x27;s a fundamental misalignment of interests. The client wants the project done, and the consultant resources gone. The consulting firm wants maximum headcount on the project for maximum duration, and therefore maximum billing.\nThis misalignment means the consulting firm can&#x27;t speak the truth to the client. The consulting firm can&#x27;t speak the truth to their employees either, and will usually give them some flim flam about how consultancy is the best of all possible worlds as it combines the security of permanent employment with the variety of contracting.<p>In fact it combines the worst of both - the insecurity of contracting with the lower pay of permie work. Consultancy firms run on one key benchmark - utilisation level.<p>Most, like ThoughtWorks or IBM Global Services, will aim for 65 to 70%. That means 65-70% of employee hours must be billable to a client. If you drop below that rate you have to fire people.<p>At the &#x27;boutique&#x27; consultancy I worked for they ran at 95%. Folk would roll off a client assignment at 5pm on a Friday, and get a phone call firing them at 5.10pm!<p>So far, so simple. As the original post made clear, it&#x27;s all about margin. And, as the original post also made clear, the result of this business model is one disastrous project after another.<p>So why does it keep happening? The fault there lies on the client side. The clients hiring the outsourcing and consultancy firms are usually large corporates looking to manage costs down. The project sponsors are senior managers with long term careers in these highly political organisations.<p>When their projects fail they can&#x27;t make a fuss about it as that would draw attention to their own management failures.\nInstead they have to pretend the project is a qualified success, and jump to another team or silo in the corporate environment so some other sucker is left clearing up the fallout.<p>So the consequences of failure are repeatedly eluded, as Mr Pointy Headed Manager slips off to another team, and the consulting firm moves on to the next billing opportunity. I was a little shocked when all this became apparent to me, back in 2002/3, when I saw a $25,000,000 project get canned by a large US bank without ever getting into production.<p>Now of course I understand that it&#x27;s just how orgs like EDS and IBM Global Services make their money. And the upside is, as the article points out, that it enables wealth transfer from developed economies in North America and Western Europe, to developing regions like Eastern Europe and India, by means of rising developer salaries.<p>The conclusion I draw is don&#x27;t ever work for a &#x27;consulting&#x27; firm like ThoughtWorks.

We&#x27;re all tech savvy people here; go into Best Buy and start looking at computers.  4 out of 5 times you&#x27;ll receive a sales pitch with, at least, a few elements of utter bullshit.<p>Meanwhile, the younger generation are becoming more and more comfortable with buy things online, sight unseen.

10464467,comment,10463205,10464282,0,0,grandalf,,,"> within a few decades, negotiating over prices would end<p>It&#x27;s interesting because often the trade-in value is mostly what is being negotiated, but the customer doesn&#x27;t realize this.  Or perhaps financing rate games are being played which the customer is unaware of.<p>I think many of the limitations come down to the way the car business is financed.  Ford Motor Credit, for example, uses lease rates as an incentive to get more vehicles manufactured.  So while the market rate for a customer might be 3.5%, there is 1% financing available for a limited time.<p>Similarly, Ford Motor Credit may prefer to incentivize leases vs purchases (or vice versa) because both look different on the company&#x27;s books.  There is arbitrage going on because the financing rate on a lease is partially due to the credit risk of the customer, and partially due to the residual price risk of the make/model/trim.<p>So the company may be happy to offer 0% financing on a sold vehicle, but only 2.9% on a lease, because the company keeps the residual price exposure.<p>This makes lease/purchase financings difficult to transform, because the accounting is only done relative to &quot;new&quot; vs &quot;end of lease&quot;, so doing it on a vehicle someone rented for a month which has 2560 miles on is much more challenging, and the result of this is that the market value of the 1 day old &quot;used&quot; vehicle is often significantly below invoice, since when it is sold as used none of the new car incentives apply, lowering the value of the vehicle significantly, and disproportionately to miles driven, wear and tear, etc.<p>So I think it&#x27;s ultimately that there is insufficient sophistication on the finance/accounting side to allow OEMs or dealers to have any incentive to keep 1 month old vehicles with 2560 miles on their books.  With a small adjustment to price and warranty, the customer should be completely indifferent to this vehicle vs a new one.<p>I think this is a legacy of the car business as an assembly line where everything coming out of the &quot;finished&quot; end needs to be sold ASAP before it goes stale.  Consumers likely want a much more services oriented approach b/c cars are typically more of a long term asset.<p>I think these are legacies of the core reason why the car companies went with the franchising model in the first place: It takes tons of capital to bring cars to market and sell/distribute them nationally, and there is a fair bit of risk too.",1446040941

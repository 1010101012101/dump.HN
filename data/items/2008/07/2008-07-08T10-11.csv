Go around to hosting companies and price out servers with 1TB drives, and keep in mind that you need some sort of RAID to avoid losing data when a drive dies... you might get down to $0.10/GB/month, but I doubt you can get below that.<p>In the long run, any company which is selling you storage for less than what it costs them is either going to go bankrupt or throw up TOS roadblocks (like dreamhost).  There really is no free lunch.",1215513897

The problem is I can't find a solution for my own needs:<p>* 200 gigs of data across 10 computers.<p>* Would prefer simple shell/cli access (scp/rsync/etc.)<p>Here are the major suggestions from browsing old discussions and why they don't work for me:<p><i></i>Amazon S3<i></i> - Would cost too much at $.15 per gig.<p><i></i>Mozy<i></i> - No cli, costs too much at 5.95 per computer. Would also rather blur distinctions between computers.<p><i></i>Dreamhost<i></i> - Pursuing those breaking TOS.<p>A solution such as Dreamhost would be perfect for me, but I can't find a shared host that allows using their services for backups/persistent storage. And Slicehost doesn't support expanding hard drive space (although I'm sure it would cost too much if they did.)<p>Am I stuck with my brick at home I currently use to do backups?",1215512920

Why can't I know what the fields of my struct are? Even Python knows how to do <i>that</i> one.<p>I want my macro code, expanded here, to be aware of that other bit of macro code expanded in that other function.<p>Yeah, there are work-arounds. I've got my own defstruct, my own defun, my own everything. And this morning, I started writing a code walker. With anguish in my heart over a lifetime of debugging the monster that was born today.<p>Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp, indeed.<p>(1) That would be Common Lisp and what I know of Scheme.

He just did something that helps him, just like exercising or listening to music or having sex. To take the easy way out as you put it probably means to give up higher/future goals for an immediate rewards. His point is that he didn't give up anything. If you want to attack him, do it there, we're more then eager for good arguments here.",1215512021

They're the YC company I think has the biggest commercial potential because it looks like something businesses would pay for.  Many (many) other YCs look like M&A targets for bigger companies.",1202763578

The problem was early developers simply trusting that Active Merchant would be problem free.<p>We ended up having to disable the internal credit card validation tests to keep the system from rejecting valid cards.

I never challenged the ""general consensus"" of Marks involvement with Mosaic - I even explicitly stated this in a prior post if you bothered to read.<p>Second, one email signed by two students doesn't mean anything.  He never says anything in the email you cited other than he and another person are looking for feedback.  For all you know his professor could have given him and that other guy that task as an asignment.  Nowhere in the email does it say anything to the effect of, ""Oh and BTW, I'm the guy who wrote all the code for this.""<p>Third, for all you know there could have been plenty of responses to the effect that you said.  One out of context email doesn't ""prove"" anything, especially if it was written by the guy in question.  Not to mention if he had the balls to run off with his professor's work, I'm sure he was smart enough to leave a paper trail, or in this case, an email trail.  Give me your personal email - I'll send you a pre-dated email ""proving"" that I invented YouTube..  There you go - I just sent you an email, nobody on the internet is contesting my email, so according to your logic, this is ""proof"" that I invented YouTube.<p>Third of all, I'm not ""changing my story"" - since I doubt you've ever been in an academic environment where somebody took your stuff and ran with it, I was trying to cite something that was more likely in terms of people taking credit for other people's work - something I thought you could better relate to.<p>""Also, please cite a source"" - if you bothered to check my other posting I cited 2, and if you google ""Lawsuit"", ""Netscape"", ""University of Illinoise"" you can find plenty of evidence to this effect. I just did and plenty of stuff comes up relating to this.  If you're too lazy to find any info on this yourself, well I'm not going to sit here and argue with you.<p>They got sued, the lawsuit involved theft of intellectual property, copywrite infringement and license violations, which would suggest that it was not 100% open-source - it was available conditional to the license, which Netscape clearly violated when they decided to release it for free over the net without compensating U. of Ill. with royalties.  They settled out of court for millions, which is similar to saying, ""We're wrong, we just don't want any legal judgements against use for being wrong, so here's a bunch of money to go away.""",1202762308

I wasn't talking about the hope as in ""I'll sit down and do nothing and hope that it fixes somehow"". I'm talking about hoping somewhere along the path you'll figure out how to fix it. And indeed an entrepreneur needs courage, but courage imho requires hope in that you secretly hope that what you are about to do will change things. Maybe both virtues are intrinsically related :)<p>You should post your comment on the blog so more people can discuss it ;)",1202762015

That worked OK, but it was obvious that we'd be more productive if we both worked in the same place.\nRecently we stared hiring more developers (3 so far), and it became clear that we just have to have a central place where everybody spends at least some of the time. We keep the hours flexible, and anyone can work from home as much as they want, but still, getting face time with each other a few days per week is priceless.

You lose biodiversity, I guess, and I suppose people miss the megafauna and they have to adjust to the change in the food chain, but beyond that, I don't see why an anoxic food chain is categorically worse than an oxic one.<p>I also disagree with a more-evolved/less-evolved view on ecosystems.  Don't evolutionary biologists prefer to think of things as more adapted or less adapted?  Isn't the view that evolution is always progress passé?  It's like people confuse ""more evolved"" with ""bigger"" because of the focus on the evolution of humans as k-strategists.",1202761098

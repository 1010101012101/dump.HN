(I don't know if the article was aimed at web startups, but it's relevant here). Each time, the crappy version 1 was shown to a large segment or some key players in the market (film critics, a huge number of mobile phone owners, and the sole client), and put them off the product.<p>I have a friend who is worried about this for his web startup.

957413,comment,957304,957304,0,0,mdasen,,,"The uncomfortability with the dollar right now seems to be a combination of a short memory and political sentiment.<p>The Euro has been strong over the majority of the past decade.  Yes, less than 10 years time.  Remember that from 1999 to 2002, the Euro was falling with decent consistency.<p>The US Dollar has been a stable currency for a lot longer and the US economy has done well for a long time.<p>People are worried about debt, but it might not be that much of a risk.  If the banks pay back the money that was lent to them, the treasury can take that money and destroy it and there's no expansion of the money supply beyond a short stop-gap.  Likewise, if they pay back the money with interest (and there's little chance this won't be the case), the US government can gain funds as well as not expanding the money supply.<p>The perception has changed a little, but not drastically with those devoid of political intent.  Sure, part of it is that the Bush administration played loose with the currency and, in fact, sometimes argued for a weaker dollar and the current wars make the US look less of a good investment, but part of it is definitely political.  I mean, if you're China you sure want to create the perception that the US won't be the continuing standard.  If nothing else, it's like having two parts suppliers even if you don't consider one of them to be a serious option - you can always use them as a negotiating chip with the supplier you do consider a serious option even if it's a hollow threat.  Likewise, many European politicians would like to consider their power rising; Iranian officials love to blast the US; people opposed to the wars want to play the debt card; etc.  And some of it is legitimate, but some of it is FUD.  I mean, if I came on here and said, ""Linux just doesn't do graphics"" there's a bit of truth there in that graphics card drivers might not come out as quickly or be as optimized, but it's not like you can't have a nice GUI or use the GIMP or whatnot, but I can say ""truthful"" things that are completely misleading because I want to advance an anti-Linux agenda.  And the same is true here, one can say that the treasury (doubled|tripled|whatnot) the debt and not talk about how most of that is being repaid and it doesn't look like there's much of a chance it won't be repaid.  It's the ""truth"", but it's still misleading.  And if you have an agenda, those truths are your friend.  Again, not to say that there aren't problems, just to say that some people might be pushing those problems out of proportion to advance an untrue agenda.<p>Oh, and one thing is important to note: government debt doesn't need to be financed.  It does in the long-run, but not in the short term.  A government with its own currency has the option to print money.  When a government just prints money, it can cause inflation since if each dollar is a fraction of the economy as a whole and there are now more dollars, each dollar is a smaller fraction of the economy.  Now, I say ""can"" there, because there isn't some automatic mechanism - it's based on people's perceptions.  In fact, inflation can happen even without an expansion of the money supply simply based on people's fear that inflation should be happening.<p>And it looks like the ""exploding debt"" will only be short term as many of the banks have already repaid their loans.<p>You can try betting on hoarding food or whatnot, but you're most likely going to turn out wrong.  It's not that other nations are ""tied"" to us so much as the US is still a very good economy.  Plus, US debt isn't so bad.  As of 2008, it was at ~38% of GDP.  Compare that with Japan at ~172% of GDP and you can see that many countries do live with a lot more debt (Italy 105%; Greece 97%; Egypt 86%; Israel 76%; Canada 63%; France 68%; Germany 66%. . .).  And as long as all the TARP money comes back to the government, there hasn't been any real expansion of the debt - it was a short term loan that looks like it'll be repaid quickly if it hasn't been repaid already.<p>Now, there are challenges.  Rising healthcare and third level education costs in the US don't look good for long-term competitiveness, but one of those looks to be on the docket at present and it's easy to forget many of the problems that European countries have when one isn't resident there.  But the US economy is far from a tale of doom.  Challenges will be ever present - what matters is whether you address them or not and whether you do so consistently.  And the US has faced up to challenges over a long period of time.<p>//That said, bonds are a terrible investment as you can usually get better rates in a CD from a bank.",1258987630

957358,story,,,3,3,cool-RR,"Ask HN: A start-loading button for videos?",,"(Reposting.)<p>I thought of an idea: Online videos should have a button, ""Start loading"", which makes the video start loading.\nPersonally, when I come across a video I want to see, I usually hit play and then immediately pause, then go read something else, so the video will be completely loaded when I start watching it. And it's annoying to do that, especially because sometimes it takes time until the pause button shows.<p>So I suggest a ""Start loading"" button that will cause the widget to start downloading the video. It will disappear the moment it is pressed or ""play"" is pressed.<p>What do you think?",1258985779
957357,comment,957192,957192,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"From my experience, seed money from an angel generally doesn't take that much equity from you in return for giving you the ability to confidently work on your project (ie: pay yourself a micro salary, hire a person or two full-time, etc.). In most cases equity is going out the door -- you either give it to your angel in return for cash to make hires, or pay early-employees with more generous equity since you lack cash.<p>One thing that is particularly important to me is finding an angel that meshes well with you/the company, that you can learn from, and that can do a lot for the company once the product launches such as VC introductions, pull strings for marketing, product advice, etc. The right combination + luck may mean you can avoid VC money all together, or retain a lot more of your company during a series A. To summarize: someone that brings more value than just cash, therefore also deserves a decent equity position because of the additional value they'll return to the company in the future.<p>So to follow the advice already given, yes raising money late can be good but it can be a timely process. If you're picky about your angel then it will take even more time to find the right person, so you should start talking/networking as soon as possible. It took us almost 8 months to close angel money because of the ""interview"" process.",1258985765

957352,comment,957266,957266,0,0,davidw,,,"> Twisted and EventMachine are hampered by the existence of a large number of blocking libraries for their respective languages. Part of the difficulty in learning those technologies is understanding which Python or Ruby libraries you can use and which ones you have to avoid.<p>This is what's interesting, I think.  The reason Erlang does so well at this is that stuff written in Erlang basically just doesn't block because a scheduler sits under the whole thing.<p>> Node creator Ryan Dahl has a stated aim for Node to never provide a blocking API—even filesystem access and DNS lookups are catered for with non-blocking callback based APIs.<p>So that's the tricky bit, I suppose, especially as your language/environment grow, and people start doing random stuff with it.<p>BTW, it's also worth mentioning that Tcl has had a nice event system since well before Twisted came out, built into the language.  However, like Python, you can't count on random commands not to block, so you have to be careful.",1258985671

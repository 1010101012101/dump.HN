Stripe's API documentation is about the best I've seen in recent years.<p>They get bonus points for making the 'cut and paste' examples <i>actually</i> cut and pastable, as they don't have instances of ""stripe.com/method/<your_api_key_here>"", and instead of have ""stripe.com/method/my_actual_api_key"", which is super convenient.<p>Perhaps the only thing that good documentation can't trump is unreliability.  This includes (obviously) an API that doesn't always return the right values, or that sometime's fails, but also includes rapidly changing API protocols.<p>Take the time to think about your APIs early, and try very hard to keep them from changing once they're established.

Bonus points for using everything we know about wireless sensor networks to monitor patients' conditions and predict when something catastrophic is about to happen, rather than relying on a person to physically examine each patient.<p>I have seen one patient who developed sepsis while in a nursing home.  She had an expressive aphasia, so she wasn't able to tell us that she was feeling ill. I wonder if we would have been able to test for it earlier with better monitoring and mining.<p>I realize it sounds obvious to say ""going to the hospital is bad"" but they have a bigger impact than you'd think. Upon return to a nursing home from a hospital, patients will have been moved to a different room. Or moved from a single-occupancy to double-occupancy room. Which has a cascade of implications in terms of their care. Often this kind of thing is a function of how much the patient can afford, which is significantly decreased after a hospitalization.

Browsers make money every time you use that little search box in the top right corner of Firefox. People have a right to be compensated for their work.

Panda doesn't care if you're solving a problem for users and giving them the eye candy they want. It apparently just wants your site to be a ""unique, well-written"" news site. People come to my site to browse vintage items and find stuff that they didn't know existed in the niche. They usually visit during work hours and late in the evening. Reading ease for these items is on a college level (Which Panda doesn't like). They don't want to read a 1000 word article, they usually just want to hear it, see it, maybe ask question or two about the item and see who may be selling one.

It is an argument in favor of it being a positive thing overall, irrespective of it working. It provides selfish incentive for caring about the fate of future generations. Since we are trying to establish betting odds and what is a fair price for cryonics, all the externalities need to be taken into account. A world with cryonics is better off than a world without it.<p>I disagree that company failures or war are unrelated to education levels (or quality). A well educated populace should be more resistant to and capable of avoiding war, and more capable of solving and preventing financial problems. One specific thing for cryonics trusts to do is offer scholarships to those pursuing peace and financial stability as educational specialties.<p>Natural disasters can be avoided to some degree by careful selection of location. Alcor is based in Arizona partly because of the lack of earthquakes. Hurricanes and tornadoes be protected against by using a monolithic dome. LN2 shortages can be protected against by having a large bulk storage tank on site, and using efficient insulation.<p>That said, the most desirable solution (because it addresses all the different sources of risk simultaneously) is to accelerate the development of revival technology to whatever degree is possible. Maintaining high education levels is critical to this, as is spending money on brain and body repair research. This produces a very large positive externality.<p>The strategy that works best is to make sure that multiple things have to go wrong in order for a critical failure at each critical point. That is how disasters are prevented in e.g. nuclear facilities. It's expensive and painstaking, but it is a case where throwing money <i>and competent engineers</i> at the problem actually works.<p>Your argument for cryonics having a low probability of working apparently assumes no one has done or will have done this, despite the obvious fact that they have an extremely strong interest in so doing.

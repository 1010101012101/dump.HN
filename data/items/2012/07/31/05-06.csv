4315920,comment,4312097,4315441,3,0,btilly,,,"It does follow.  If you're hiring people who are equally attractive to you, and one is attractive in part because of the degree, then for them to be equally attractive they must be worse on your other desired qualifications - such as demonstrated competence.  My claim is that demonstrated competence is more important than the degree.  Therefore of those two candidates, the one without the degree usually turns out to be better.<p>This is actually true about any discriminated against group (which people without degrees are).  On average the discriminated against group may be worse (for whatever historical reasons), but the ones who are good enough to become seriously considered despite that are actually <i>better</i> than the ones you would consider equally desirable.  Therefore if you're on the fence about a decision, you should prefer the one who lacks the most obvious signals like degrees, etc.<p>This may sound like an abstract and weird hypothesis.  But it is a testable one.  For example see <a href=""http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6498.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6498.html</a> for evidence that being willing to hire women into management in a culture where women are discriminated against results in better financial returns for the company that is willing to do so.<p>As for your hypothesis that people with a degree are more likely to have the required skills, that depends heavily on the job.  Certainly if you're going to hire someone to work on a compiler, you'd prefer people who know how compilers work.  Which gives a big edge to CS grads.  But for general software development I'd prefer someone who can quote <i>Code Complete</i> back at me than an average CS grad.<p>(Disclaimer, I have a masters in math, and almost finished my PhD.  If you are looking to hire me, and you have an alternate candidate without my academic qualifications who you think is a tossup compared to me, then yes, I am saying that you should hire them instead.)",1343713901

I figured there would be gaps in user ids mostly because of massive deletions of spammer accounts, and a quick sample estimated the gaps to be on the order of 20%. So I generated 1.25M unique user ids in the range 0-637M, and tried to fetch the profile details for them.<p>[...]<p>After fetching the 12,500 batches I was left with 1,039,556 Twitter profiles. This means that there must exist approximately 530 million Twitter accounts: 83% of 637M.""<p>The problem is that Twitter account IDs used to be sequential - every integer would correspond to an account, unless that account had been deleted. Then in 2011 Twitter introduced the Snowflake update <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-ids-json-and-snowflake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-ids-json-and-snowflake</a> which changed the way IDs were generated (for scaling reasons - it's much better to have separate machines able to deal out IDs rather than rely on a single point of failure).<p>This means that if you were to create a pool of random IDs between 1 and 637,000,000 you'll find that the IDs below a certain number (the highest ID at the time snowflake kicked in) almost all correspond to an account, whereas the IDs above that number have a much higher number of misses.",1343713820

4315913,comment,4312731,4312731,2,0,saurik,,,"Out of curiosity, I just went back to a campaign I ran last year with Facebook to see if I was affected. I spent $2k on CPC advertisements with a filter targeting people related to phones, Cydia, Apple, etc.; the result was that I caught enough people that some smaller blogs reported on my ads.<p><a href=""http://www.givememind.com/saurik-advertises-cydia-tweak-on-facebook-youmail-visual-voicemail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givememind.com/saurik-advertises-cydia-tweak-on-f...</a><p>So, this campaign lasted one day, just over a year ago, on July 22nd. During this time, Facebook claims I got 5229 clicks. According to Google Analytics (which will only log users whom have JavaScript working and enabled), I got 5057 hits to that landing page.<p>Finally, working from logs, I have managed to find 5643 total requests for the URL. If I filter for those that explicitly sent a referer from facebook.com/ajax, I see 4644; of course, many people have browsers that do not send referers due to various reasons.<p>Therefore, I feel safe concluding that, for my website, a year ago, I was not having ""80% of ad clicks from bots"". I present this evidence in order to help people attempting to understand this issue to provide the possible clue that this is either ""user-specific"" or ""changed in the last year"".",1343713761

Would you find much value in advertising there at all?</i><p>You've actually brought up a very valid point; I kind of hinted on this in my OP but it deserves some clarification: has Facebook proven so far that these ad clicks are in some way spurious?  Granted, knowing what motivated the clicks is an impossibly tall order; however I don't see much difference in what you've proposed versus the many Pages that encourage users to promote more followers in promise of some sort of a rebate/discount/incentive with a brick and mortar establishment.<p>The primary and most obvious difference here is that there isn't a cost simply for putting up a Fan page.  However and ultimately, my original premise I think deserves just as much consideration as incentivizing ad clicks to boost leads: unless Facebook can show that these clicks originated from a source and can sufficiently extrapolate evidence that these sources are motivated to disrupt the platform, I do not understand the author's complaint.",1343713731

Degrees, of course, have almost nothing to do with this; companies need a consistent philosophy to produce consistent results, and a CEO you hire off the street isn't going to do much unless your company is in full automation mode by that time. Apple definitely did the right thing to style Tim Cook as a Jobs protege. I'm not really worried that Apple is just going to lose its material edge overnight, but I think some may perceive things that way, and for Apple, it's all about perception.<p>Something like McDonalds, Wal-Mart et al was established as a cookie cutter, repeatable thing. People go there because they want consistency; they know what to expect. Their patrons aren't looking to have their minds blown or to become excited about their interactions; the most successful companies in the world are much maligned externally because they're seen as dry and exploitative, but most people still patronize them. It's not cool to like them, but they do very well precisely because of that predictability, that blandness.<p>Apple, however, lives and dies by its reputation as a visionary, an entity that is constantly breaking new ground. This is because owning a Mac is as much about the cult of Mac as it is about the actual benefits of the product. Apple isn't a cookie-cutter franchise; it needs to bring controversy and produce products that are radically different from the rest of the industry to maintain credibility. If that credibility as a visionary is lost, much of Apple's userbase comes into jeopardy, because believe it or not, it's still less effort for most people to use Windows. That will never change until OS X approaches 50% of the market.<p>For companies like this, the keystones of their cultural identity are the most important business assets to protect. Unfortunately, Apple chose to heavily exploit ""the genius of Steve Jobs"" angle while he was around (perhaps because it's much more difficult to propagate a narrative about the vision of a design committee than the vision of one amazing man), and now they're paying a price for it.<p>Apple may recover, and they have some usable momentum, but it's definitely going to take some oomph out of their sails because Apple's dominance is not based on the superiority of its products, but the culture and attitude around them. I think Cook is well-qualified for the CEO position, but imo the way to put this Jobs stuff to rest is to present Cook as a regularly ordained successor, tutored by Jobs, and to have him assume some very Jobsian habits that would make this externally visible (for instance, give Cook the same veneration and mystery that Jobs received while presenting at Apple conferences, make him the human focal point and the apparent origin of all innovations). To the people closest to Steve Jobs, this may seem a grotesque mockery, but if your whole company is based on the dog and pony show, you have to keep up appearances.",1343712893

I taught myself programming as a teenager, worked at a tech startup through college (getting a degree in a non-CS engineering field), worked as a software engineer after college, then headed off to law school.<p>There is no substitute for the skills you'll develop early in your career hacking code at a startup. At the same time, after years of working as a programmer, I feel unbalanced. I've had a lot of success at my previous jobs, but ran into challenging problems where I wished I had a few more formal analytical techniques in my toolbox. I can ""just pick up"" a new programming language, but I haven't been able to ""just pick up"" type theory.<p>After three years of education in law, I've come to appreciate what formal education brings to the table: an appreciation for the big picture principles of a field that are hard to grasp when you're neck deep in code working at a startup. Any auto-didact could be a lawyer. With practice, doing similar things repeatedly, they could be a very efficient one. But even a mundane corporate bankruptcy can bring up a novel point of law, and its when you encounter something totally unfamiliar that a formal education really proves useful. I think someone who can draw on the broad principles of the field is at a huge advantage when dealing with a complex novel problem than someone who has just seen the pretty specific areas that they've hacked on.<p>Now, if I could choose between an auto-didact with no degree and someone with a great degree and no ability to self-teach, I'd choose the former, most of the time. But if I were doing a startup that involved designing the next TCP/IP, I'd probably pick the PhD without any programming skills to speak of.",1343711936

Maybe that's why some of the folks are so offended at it.<p>Like it or not, even the Mac is a complex combination of hardware and software, and while much of this is obvious to those of us who spend 8+ hours in front of a computer, its not obvious those everyone else. While perhaps poorly executed, I think the ads do point out the difference between Apple and Everyone Else; When you buy a Mac, there is ALWAYS an expert standing by to help you solve your problems, someone who knows everything about your hardware and software, this is something the PC world does not have.",1343710963

That company's UI code base was 3 MM SLOC or so and we used perforce and silk though we didn't use any build accelerators as I had the UI down to under 1 hour from scratch and the backend was under 3 hours if I recall and this was 8 years ago or so.<p>That codebase was a beast and there was code from 1979 floating around in some of the core Fortran routines.  The scary part was the app ostensibly had backward compatibility to files created in the 80s though it was well designed enough to have anticipated most of cases.<p>I'm sort of surprised their build takes so long without accelerators but then again I'm not as without using precompiled headers I think our build was several hours longer.  If they could not structure their projects to take advantage of pch files and if the source is very #include heavy I can see it.  How external code references are handled is another reason interpreted languages rock and Java/.NET are superior to C and C++ build systems in my experience.",1343710913

Cache. The memory in your CPU? Cache. The memory in your hard drive? Cache.<p>Your filesystem has a cache. Your browser has a cache. Your DNS resolver has a cache. Your web server's reverse proxy [should] have a cache. Your database [should] have a cache. Every place that you can conceivably shove in another cache, it can't hurt. Say it with me now: Cache Rules Everything Around Me.<p>First you should learn how web servers work, why we use them, and how to configure them. The reason your Apache instance was running slow is probably because you never tuned it. Granted, five years ago its asynchronous capabilities were probably haggard and rustic. It's gotten a lot more robust in recent years, but that's beside the article's point. Nginx is an apple, CloudFront is an orange.<p>Next you should learn what CDNs are for. Mainly it's to handle lots of traffic reliably and provide a global presence for your resources, as well as shielding your infrastructure from potential problems. Lower network latency is just a happy side effect.",1343710905

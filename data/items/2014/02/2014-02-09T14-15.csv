7205637,comment,7204988,7205525,4,0,dalke,,,"> I think this proves the point that you would have to try pretty hard to get the false conviction.<p>Is that all you&#x27;re worried about? This article points out some of the problems of being arrested, like concern that others in the jail will find that the arrestee is accused of being a terrorist. There&#x27;s also the social taint of being so named, which may make employment more difficult.<p>Even without arrest, there&#x27;s still the stress of knowing that one is being observed. See what happened to Steven Hatfill, a &quot;person of interest&quot; in the anthrax attacks of 2001, who was never arrested.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue that some huge majority of convictions (95+%?) are plea bargained, and where the prosecutor&#x27;s strategy is to give as many charges as possible, so it&#x27;s in the interest of the defendant to plead guilty to a few of the lesser ones rather than the much more expensive trial needed to defend all of the charges.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a strong desire to not question a judgement, keep the case open, and preserve information which might otherwise lead to a reversal. Quoting Wikipedia: &quot;In the case of Joseph Roger O&#x27;Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O&#x27;Dell, &quot;it would be shouted from the rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man.&quot; The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.&quot;<p>We know there&#x27;s, what, over 300 overturned convictions based on DNA evidence (meaning, that&#x27;s limited to only those cases where there was physical evidence that could be used).<p>All this should be evidence that 1) using court judgements is ignoring a large part of the issue, 2) the trial must not be the final checkpoint, and 3) the legal system is not set up to help aid post-trial exonerations.",1391956494

7205615,comment,7205136,7205515,4,0,Lazare,,,"Kinda.  A few points to help clarify things:<p>All funds that go into the business will either be debt or equity.  Debt gets a guaranteed rate of return, and needs to be paid back.  It gets first claim if you go under, but gets no &quot;bonus&quot; if you do well.  Equity is an ownership stake; last in line if you go under, but with a claim on all future profits if you do well.  The most obvious type of equity stake is your own, but you might say to a friend hey, go halves with me on buying a new lathe, and I&#x27;ll split the profits from the furniture I make 50/50.  That&#x27;s another example of an equity stake, as old as the hills.<p>All a stock market is, is your friend saying &quot;look, I&#x27;ve got the note saying I have a right to 50% of the profits of Zac&#x27;s furniture business, but I&#x27;m broke right now; anyone wanna give me $50 for it?&quot;.  And because in practice this sort of thing is fraught with risk, this is incredibly regulated, but that&#x27;s all a stock market is; people trading the right to some uncertain future profits.  (Well...kinda.  There&#x27;s also the question of control.  Some shares give you a say in how a company is run; some don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s rarely a factor though.)<p>Notionally, incidentally, the value of a company&#x27;s stock is the discounted sum of all future cash flows.  If you owe 100% of Amazon, obviously you have the right to 100% of all future profit they make.  If you owe 0.0001% of Amazon, you have the right to 0.0001% of all future profit they make.  That&#x27;s the core driver of stock prices; the market&#x27;s ever-changing estimation of a companies future.<p>As for HFT...no, you won&#x27;t make huge profits.  The entire HFT industry, globally, makes chicken feed, but they make for VERY entertaining news stories, so you read about them a ton.<p>Anyhow, as to &quot;why HFT is good&quot;, the answer is basically that we all benefit when markets work better, and one way markets can work better is if they are deep and liquid.  In simple terms, that means that if you want to buy or sell something, there&#x27;s always someone there offering to take the other side of the trade for more-or-less the market rate.  Conversely, housing is a very shallow, very illiquid market.  If you want to sell your $400k house, it might takes weeks or months, and you may find yourself happily paying significant fees to the broker, and maybe even selling it at a discount, just to get the damn thing to sell.  If you want to sell your share of Apple stock, it will take microseconds, and you&#x27;ll get <i>very</i> close to the market rate (ie, low commission/low spread).  And while HFT doesn&#x27;t have a huge impact, to the extent it has <i>an</i> impact, it is to make the market deeper, more liquid, and more efficient.  HFT benefits the HFT traders, but it also, and this is really, really, important to grasp <i></i>benefits every person who trades with the HFT traders<i></i>.  The losers are the &quot;low frequency traders&quot; who <i>would</i> have bought your Apple share from you a little slower and for a little less money, but lost out.<p>But again, this effect is minimal.  The drive for HFT is the race for pennies in an increasingly efficient and competitive market.  Small time investors, honestly, aren&#x27;t the victims here.  (Unless they&#x27;re doing the day-trading, &quot;I can pick stocks because I read a book on trend analysis&quot; thing, in which case...they&#x27;re absolutely screwed, but no more so now than before HFT.  The stock market is not a game.)<p>And no, I wouldn&#x27;t say the market is becoming &quot;more one-sided&quot;; that presupposes there being two sides.  There aren&#x27;t; there are seven billion sides.  HFT does not profit at the expense of pension funds or entrepreneurs; it profits at the expense of everyone <i>else</i> who wanted to profit from them.<p>And I think the sports analogy is especially inapt.  We want markets to work as efficiently as possible.  We want sports to provide a spectacle.  These things are not similar.",1391956050

He told them that to gain competitive advantage you cheat. Games are mostly random so you can get ahead without getting competitive advantage. And you don&#x27;t even need to get ahead to have almost all benefits of playing the game or even some other benefits that you can&#x27;t get when you have an advantage.<p>I think that attitude towards cheaters is pretty much an american (maybe british?) cultural thing. Lot&#x27;s of people were successfully taught to be honest, and if they can&#x27;t be honest to defend the ideal of honesty by teaching honesty and never admitting their dishonesty. People who are honest about their dishonesty meet exasperation and disbelieve.<p>> If a company sold hedge funds an early look at their earnings, it&#x27;d be insider trading. But when a third-party like Business Wire sells hedge funds an early, albeit split-second, look at corporate earnings, it&#x27;s perfectly legal. It&#x27;s nuts.<p>Nuts is the fact that insider trading is illegal. It&#x27;s unenforceable idea of how to make intrinsically unfair game appear sort of fair. It comes from the fact that shares are not as attractive as they need to be on their own. Possessing part of some company and getting dividends when the company decides to pay them is not incentive enough to shell out your cash and give it to the company that needs the cash to develop.<p>Since people love to participate in lotteries (before taxes it was the way money was gathered for expensive projects, people were just voluntarily were giving their money away in hopes of winning the big prize) they attached sort of casino to the idea of shares. The game is mostly: guess future ratio of supply and demand for pieces of paper. But people don&#x27;t like to play in the casinos that are known to rig the games and despite the fact that price is random as it depends on so many different pieces of information some information can have some predictable influence. So casino (exchange and companies) pinky swear to prevent anyone from acting on the knowledge that gamers didn&#x27;t have chance to familiarize themselves with. It works. I makes the game look fair.

7205589,comment,7205520,7205520,1,0,aflaisler,,,"Is China the first (ever) Growth Hacker\nThe situation<p>I am not a big fan of thinking. To be perfectly honest I am not even sure I am good at it. So I will go straight to the point. Yesterday evening, whilst enjoying my 2nd (or 5th) rounds of shots with some friends, I realised the glass I was using was “made in China” (for the record, I should precise I am a French man working in startups in London for 3 years now as a Web/user/marketing analyst and more recently as a Growth hacker).<p>Anyway that’s fair enough, there are no cutting edge discoveries here. However starting next week my first day as a full time Growth hacker for an email app (<a href=""http://wizzmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wizzmail.com</a>), I somehow kept thinking all day about it (along with, “is taking a 4th x 500mg of paracetamol a good thing to do”). Cleverly (or not), instead I decided to write my thoughts about it.<p>Why is China so obsessed about putting its fingerprint on every single things they are manufacturing? I mean seriously, I am pretty sure that 80% of the products around me have been manufactured there and actually have a mention proving it, starting with the computer I am writing with at the moment.<p>Please, don’t take me wrong, I really like my laptop, and I believe China is quite good at what they are doing (eg: manufacturing very good value for money product that company can scale easily).<p>So why do they still feel the need to put that “made in China” sticker everywhere? I mean who else does that? And on EVERY products?<p>Time for the first argument<p>Let’s take an example of two friends of mine that needed a GPS receptor able to communicate with the GPRS French network (<a href=""http://mapetitebalise.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mapetitebalise.com</a> ). Guess their first sourcing destination choice was?<p>If you have India in mind, well sorry to tell you but you are wrong. It was (TaDam…) China! If you are still reading, I bet you are thinking those dudes must (at least) have searched for such products on Alibaba.com (which by the way is saving Yahoo.com from going out of business).<p>And you are right, yes they did.<p>In fact, Alibaba, is really amazing for helping any company in the world sourcing products made primarily in China. For example, let’s say you need a JCT graphite nuclear reactor. Well, they have it : <a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/1188259098/JCT_graphite_nuclear_reactor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/1188259098/JCT_graphite_nu...</a> (I don’t even know what that is).<p>Now, let’s say you just need an olive oil extractor, they also have it: <a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/877079592/cold_press_oil_extraction_machine_sesame.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/877079592/cold_press_oil_e...</a>.<p>The list is actually so long I am not sure my computer’s memory can hold it. The fact is Alibaba.com will provide you the best deals for almost everything you need to manufacture.<p>2nd argument<p>Since the new government of Francois Hollande was elected in France (May 2012), the country got itself a full-time minister, nominated for the “productive recovery” of France : <a href=""http://www.redressement-productif.gouv.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redressement-productif.gouv.fr/</a>.<p>I should warn you, this is when you might be mind blown: guess what was his first move?<p>Yes, he created a lot of advantages for products made in France and also strongly advised companies to show that their products were made in France (by “strongly” I actually mean mostly financial advantages).<p>Third and last small argument<p>Finally, the other day, I found myself downloading an app called Frontback. This was in fact, just because a friend posted a cool personalized picture on facebook with the mention (“via frontback” - <a href=""http://frontback.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://frontback.me/</a> ).<p>So, lets sum up:<p>- China is writing down “made in China” since at least the 90s (before that I wasn’t able to check)<p>- This mention, seems to make people/company looking for sourcing products, firstly search in China (just like the high CTR for the first ad on a Google search)<p>- The French government decided to try it - to make people buy more french made products<p>My conclusion:<p>Writing “made in China” on all products manufactured in China is a growth hack. In fact, I am tempted to say that China was one of the first Growth hacker using this method.<p>Want to interact?<p>Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/aflaisler"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/aflaisler</a>",1391955488

But we still get the characteristic slowness of government. Without a strong event to do so, it will be hard. The Snowden leaks seem to be a good trigger for a Church committee-style event, but it won&#x27;t be instant.",1391954599

But I don&#x27;t think there is no probability processing anywhere in the system (we do conscious probability if not else). My thoughts were that it can&#x27;t be the main or important driver behind it all. I think the memory itself (storage and &quot;soft&quot; retrieval of information .. my theory on models that we make) plays much more important role in our function than any special or complex algorithm.

Massive public protests are now far less effective than they were, because the authorities are using new technologies, such as mass-surveillance, to suppress them.<p>The result is an ossifying system of government, that is slowly, but surely diverging from consent of the people.",1391954443

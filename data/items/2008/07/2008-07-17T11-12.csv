Multiple view points would help the computer figure out the full three dimensional object, but then again, object recognition comes into play, which object is which?<p>This system works with humans because we have good 3D object recognition and a huge database of experience with which to compare it against, all of which is calculated in an instant.<p>Replicating that behaviour in a computer is still a long way away.",1216295850

The iPhone has a resolution of 480x320, at 3.5"", for 160dpi;  the Neos have a 2.8"" 640x480 resolution screen, at 280dpi.  It's <i>really</i> nice to look at and read text on. :)",1216294998
248401,comment,248168,248400,0,0,ajross,,,"Your implication seems to be that Cairo doesn't work on an accelerated backend?  That's not correct.  It is correct that the primitive assembly happens client side in Cairo, which I'm not sure is a misfeature.  The IPC overhead of DPS was always one of its biggest problems.",1216294741

248392,story,,,18,17,DanielBMarkham,"Ask HN: Anybody outsource their startup?",,"So here's the deal:<p>I'm a consultant. One of my large customers is having a problem with X. So I wrote out the database specs and a few screens around how to fix X. The customer is interested in trying out my program on a few users.<p>Now I don't have bandwidth to both finish the program and hand-hold the users AND continue consulting with this customer. Needless to say, in the customer's eyes the consulting part is what they want. In my eyes I'd rather be working on this small start-up opportunity. If I leave the consulting part, I'll lose my first customer as my start-up.<p>It just occurred to me that since my data model, my DAL, and my screen framework is complete, I could hire out the rest of the coding. After all, I could pay somebody to work full-time on the project. Even if they weren't as effective a coder as I was, there would always be sombody on the other end of the phone for the customers (in addition to having me personally on-site from time to time)<p>Anybody else do something like this? I know as hackers it's best to be close to the solution, but isn't there a point where you can hand off things like bug fixes and trivial data entry screens to somebody with more bandwidth?<p>Interested in your opinion.<p>And BTW -- anybody with C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and Telerik experience who wants in on the action is welcome to respond.",1216293920

248390,comment,248168,248361,0,0,ajross,,,"Cairo can, and does work that way.  There are current cairo backends for X11, Postscript, PDF, flat image buffers, OpenGL, SVG, win32, quartz, and no doubt a bunch of others I'm forgetting.  The whole point of the thing was to have a robust, path-based imaging model that works everywhere.<p>This is now 4 year old technology.  Please flame with more current criticism. :)",1216293811
248389,comment,248168,248244,0,0,ajross,,,"It's a little apples-to-oranges, but it's not ""wrong"".  Lots of IPC problems really are solved fastest using a socket or pipe.  Writing to a shared memory buffer doesn't clue the kernel in to the fact that there is new data available, which means you need a syscall anyway to transfer control.  And it makes the application responsible for all the buffering that occurs, and applications don't have a ""big picture"" available to properly optimize things.<p>Don't diss the pipe.  It doesn't do everything, but if you're going to pick just one IPC mechanism, it's the one.",1216293495

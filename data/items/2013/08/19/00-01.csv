But that created confusions because you can&#x27;t end a number with a space.  For example, 1 and 100 would look the same if you just used a space in place of zero.  They eventually created a symbol for zero, but never used it by itself or at the end of a number.<p>Similarly, the Incas used a space for a zero, but it creates the same reliance on context to deduce the meaning of a space.  And since the Incas represented numbers differently in the ones place, that was their marker for the end of a number, which means it can&#x27;t be nothing.  I imagine they could leave a space at the end and use the context of the numbers above or below since numbers were vertically aligned in the quipu.<p>So no, Incas did not have a proper zero.",1376873411

The answer is yes, absolutely. But there&#x27;s more to it than that -- each CW (continuous wave) transmitter had different characteristics, in the days when most of them were built by their operators -- some of them changed frequency slightly during each dash, some of them had noticeable clicks caused by too fast a transmitter activation and deactivation around each Morse element -- these helped one identify a specific operator along with his personal sending style.<p>A few years ago, about the time that the FCC abandoned the code sending/receiving requirement, I assumed that CW was dead. But lately, listening to the ham bands, I see there&#x27;s a surprising amount of CW activity still present.<p>> Were you able to hear full words or phrases &quot;natively&quot;?<p>Over time one begins to hear entire words, especially at high sending rates.

They&#x27;d have plenty of ways to fail besides not knowing how to read a manual.<p>>Do you think that someone who is smart enough to do Java development for 10 years isn&#x27;t smart enough to pick up a new Java-based environment in days/weeks?<p>Weeks, maybe. Days: It depends on what you mean. Start tweaking Java code in an existing app? Sure, why not. Architect a non-trivial app from scratch? Extremely unlikely. Again, talking statistically.<p>95% of Java developers are NOT as sophisticated as probably half of C++ developers. There&#x27;s a higher minimum threshold of skill to work on the problems that C++ developers work on than the ones that MOST Java developers work on.<p>You can be a 100% competent Java developer, and yet not have the right skills to do most of what I do on a regular basis.<p>And this isn&#x27;t about YOU; I&#x27;m only talking statistically. Most Java developers work on server code, enterprise code, private company apps, and other things in very different domains that thinks that I work on. These things are important, skilled work; and they&#x27;re VERY DIFFERENT than Android development. Or game development. Or low-level C development.<p>>Your attitude reeks or arrogance, elitism and lack of empathy. I&#x27;d never want to work with people like you in any capacity.<p>I do believe I&#x27;m a better developer than most. I feel like that&#x27;s based on objective facts, but it certainly can come across as arrogance or elitism. Truth is I&#x27;m happy to work with developers of any skill level, as long as they have the skills to do the tasks they&#x27;re assigned to do. I spent years working as developer tech support for a popular API, and I helped hundreds of developers to use it correctly, and to find the bugs in their apps -- by the end I had a nontrivial fan club, and a lot of people contacted me later to see if they could work with me. But have it your way.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you glean lack of empathy from my post. I empathize with people just fine; if I&#x27;m hiring someone, though, I have to make a business decision that makes sense, and I&#x27;d have to be stupid to hire someone who can&#x27;t get the job done, as much as I&#x27;d love to give everyone work. Too often I&#x27;ve <i>not</i> been ruthless enough; someone with years of experience in Android AND Java and tons of great references must be good enough to get my project done, right? Wrong. See: Mythical Man Month, some programmers are 10-20x better than others.<p>If you tell me who you are, though, I&#x27;ll be sure that we don&#x27;t accidentally work with each other in any capacity.

IIRC, the workaround  however &#x27;leaked&#x27; due to a browser bug (which Google themselves submitted a fix to WebKit for) which causes other cookies to bypass the filter. Google also stopped doing it, and removed all the cookies that had been set.<p>So what do the people pushing this suit want to happen? The loophole got closed (IIRC, the webkit fix by Google happened prior to the WSJ story exposing the loophole, it&#x27;s just that Apple doesn&#x27;t update its browser that frequently), the cookies were removed, the behavior has stopped.<p>There is still the need for federated, secure, login, whether it is cookies or some other mechanism, it is a problem that has to be solved, I worry government interference can actually inhibit progress here.<p>And why isn&#x27;t Apple included in the case? Shouldn&#x27;t they be suing for a faulty implementation as well? If someone sells a door lock that doesn&#x27;t really work, and your house gets robbed, the robber gets charged, but you can bring a civil case against the lock manufacturer too. After all, even if Google&#x27;s behavior is changed, there are lots of other blackhats who can leverage bugs, so going after a single exploit isn&#x27;t actually solving the problem, the single point of failure was the Safari implementation.  <conspiracy theory time> I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical that this is an organic case. I mean, I do think people have a right to have their day in court if they think they were actually harmed by this, but could it be that Microsoft&#x27;s byzantine array of &quot;attack Google&quot; organizations is behind this case?

I&#x27;m anti-drone because I believe they&#x27;d be used for indiscriminate surveillance or to gather specific evidence the police want. I would find it implausible that they&#x27;d be used to vindicate a civilian or to &quot;watch the watchers&quot;. The presumption is different with body cameras. If standard practice is to wear them and record at all times, they should be used as evidence of the truth either way - whether that condemns the police of justifies their actions. I&#x27;m okay with anything that would prove the truth neutrally and impartially, as long as it respected reasonable bounds of privacy. If body cameras could only be used when the police chose to, I would be against them as though they were drones.",1376870662

I&#x27;d assume after one direct hit against ones&#x27; person a more careful approach would be indicated. That&#x27;s still an assumption but I really can&#x27;t imagine anybody that has been the subject of a targeted theft like that to carry incriminating data on their person across a border.",1376870519

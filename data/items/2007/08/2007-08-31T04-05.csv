For instance, it is very hard to find people who are good with audio/video signal processing in the USA. The good ones are all in Europe.  We have guys in France, Spain, London, and Estonia.

I, too, will never do a startup alone, as it's just too draining to do so.<p>At the same time, it's exactly what someone should do who's starting out, if they can't get funding or a team together.

Fortunately, the stat is a load of crap. <p>He talks about how the average outcome of widely differing situations isn't useful.

Still, it's always more enjoyable to read something new.<p>One problem is that I've re-read (and re-listened) to everything PG and Pmarca have ever posted on the damn internet, many times over. Now I just re-read the best ones for the 20th time. I read/listen on the train, at lunch, and at the park so my appetite is insatiable. Need. More. Content.

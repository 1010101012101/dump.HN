The United States is the only G7 country that doesn&#x27;t have straightforward, non-lottery ways to obtain permanent legal residency and work status. In most developed countries the idea of a non-immigrant work visa is extremely limited; once you are in the country you are accumulating time toward obtaining permanent residency.<p>The US immigration system is a series of exceptions and loopholes, if you investigate the process for immigrating to any other G7 country you will find that there is a general &quot;skilled migrant&quot; category with some basic requirements (such as education, language proficiency, good health) that more or less guarantees eventual citizenship once obtained.",1416898781

If these explanations sound unscientific, I think it is more likely that it from the author simplifying the explanation of his problem, and perhaps he is confused about or is miss-communicating what his doctors have told him.<p><pre><code>  One person, who I was living with to shorten my commute to the hospital, which I was visiting three days a week for treatment ...</code></pre>
Getting treatment at a hospital implies that doctors identified some known medical condition they could treat.<p><pre><code>  My body retains toxins—and not, like, generic “toxins” that health nuts talk about, I mean real toxins, like benzene and mercury.</code></pre>
If there are tests for benzene and mercury, this could indicate a medically detectable problem. He also seems to dismiss the pseudo-scientific explanation of toxins.<p><pre><code>  My body rejects things it should keep, like magnesium. Especially magnesium. Also zinc.</code></pre>
Again, if there are tests for this, there might be some truth to this.<p>It is unclear how much of his description of his medical problems is known for certain, or how much of this is speculation. He admits that he &quot;barely understand&quot;s it. I would like to hear a medical explanation for why his explanation is impossible or problematic before concluding that it is simply pseudo-scientific gobbledygook.",1416898491

8656662,comment,8656028,8656164,0,0,millstone,,,"I&#x27;ll try. A shortage is when supply is sufficiently low and inelastic that consumers cannot satisfy an (appropriately defined) base level of consumption.<p>For example, in 2008, the supply of food dropped in Haiti. Prices rose to clear the market, but there was literally not enough food for survival. Many people ate dirt instead, what might callously be called a &quot;substitute good&quot; in purely economic terms. Of course this was a very serious and tragic food shortage.<p>What would a labor shortage look like? Specialized labor has an inelastic supply: you can only train workers so fast. In 2011, Georgia passed an anti-immigration law, and saw a huge drop in skilled agricultural workers that they could not hire enough. When $140 million worth of crops are left to rot in the fields, you&#x27;ve got a labor shortage.<p>I&#x27;d call it a serious shortage if, say, there were not enough IT workers to maintain the Internet.

Can you name the company or provide a link?<p>Investing in employees only makes sense if the company thinks the investment will pay off. Let&#x27;s say a company views the expected value of an employee at $100 000 a year. Instead of trying to hire someone at that rate they decide to train someone. Training costs money and doesn&#x27;t always result in someone that can fill the role. Let&#x27;s say it takes $20 000 to successfully train someone. To break even on their investment the company would need to pay below market rates for some period of time. If they pay $90 000 a year for the next two years we plans to bump the person&#x27;s salary to the full $100 000 afterwards what are the odds the person will stick around for the full two years? In a hot job market why wouldn&#x27;t they leave and start getting the full $100 000 earlier?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the current system works well but I&#x27;m not convinced this approach makes sense for most companies.",1416898038

Aside from that, there&#x27;s probably more of a shift in what the author now considers an important idea than anything: the humanities and sciences address different subject matters. Scientific discoveries often serve to restrict the realm of viable philosophies (e.g. cognitive science&#x27;s impact on the any theory of innate knowledge a la Plato), but if it ever says something positive on a philosophical subject, that subject is no longer philosophy proper—and there&#x27;s plenty of room for philosophy still.<p>The rest of the humanities, from my understanding, is about communicating ideas about human life—often times about the experience of living it—using a different set of techniques than the sciences, and the utility of those techniques has not diminished.",1416897786

There is no STEM shortage, there&#x27;s a shortage of a particular subset of STEM-related skills, most notably software development (which btw is a skill barely even taught even in CS, and certainly not filtered for, leading to people with CS degrees that can&#x27;t code their way out of a paper bag). Even within just IT, software development stands out by a mile in all stats when it comes to the imbalance between jobs and candidates.<p>2. Wages are being artificially kept down despite the shortage. Migrant visa&#x27;s are one of the things being abused to depress wages. The fact that this is happening during a shortage is remarkable and confusing, but can be explained by fear (wages will explode sooner or later, and this terrifies many employers) and by the low social standing of software developers (even within IT software developers have for the longest time been known as the code monkeys at the bottom of the hierarchy, just above the support people) which leads to even developers themselves not questioning their salaries.

In addition, by choosing to enroll in the class or in the college the students have agreed to invest a portion of their time learning. Completely ignoring the class and doing something else on a laptop or phone says that the student in question believes the course or college is a waste of their time. While that may be a valid point to make, I feel it is cowardice to make it by ignoring the people around them. It could just as easily be made by letting everyone know they think the course is a waste of their time and then leaving the course. Even better, they can stay and try to improve it.

8656566,comment,8653416,8656362,0,0,joycey,,,"Sure. I found some fun stats you can look through. With regards to women dropping out of a software development role, it looks like women are dropping out at higher rates than men because they either want to pursue a non-technical career or they drop out of the workforce entirely because women are expected to be the primary caregiver. And when kids come along and a couple has to choose between sacrificing a husband&#x27;s career or a wife&#x27;s career, usually the wife will choose to leave.<p>> On women dropping out of CS at a higher rate
I can&#x27;t seem to find any hard numbers on how women are more likely to drop out of CS in college, but I imagine it is because if a woman gets a lower grade (such as a B) in a class she is less likely to major in it than her male counterpart [0]. While that study only refers to one professor&#x27;s economics students, in my experience the effect holds very true. Women who receive C&#x27;s (which are like harvard B&#x27;s) are much less confident in their technical capabilities than their male classmates who receive C&#x27;s.<p>> On women dropping out of tech after getting a technical degree
After 10 years of experience working in high tech, 17% of males will quit and 41% of females will quit. These women will either take on a non-technical job or take time off the workforce (presumably motherhood). But at some point after 10-20 years of experience, around 56% of women will drop out. [1, page 18] It&#x27;s a pretty well-documented phenomenon that women are perceived as the primary caretaker, and are thus more likely to sacrifice their job to care for children but here&#x27;s how that, in conjunction with the fact that technical women leave for non-technical jobs, plays out.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/catherine-rampell-women-should-embrace-the-bs-in-college-to-make-more-later/2014/03/10/1e15113a-a871-11e3-8d62-419db477a0e6_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/catherine-rampell-wom...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/ncwit_thefacts_rev2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/ncwit_the...</a>",1416895688

Not generally fixable despite people trying crazy things like blowing hair dryer down the headphone socket etc.",1416895526

Absolute bottom-of-the-barrel cesspool traffic trying to probe for vulnerabilities, commit fraud, scrape content, avoid IP blocks, and generally abuse your site in ways that the attacker wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable doing with their own IP address. It&#x27;s really tragic - given the potential of the network as a privacy tool - that it&#x27;s mostly used for evil, not good.",1416895442

Going beyond that would involve knowing about system-specific things that C is explicitly designed to abstract away, to make programs more portable.<p>So, no, the struct hack isn&#x27;t valid C, but you <i>can</i> make huge arrays and, within those arrays, simple increments and decrements <i>do</i> work reliably, because the standard says so and the OS and the compiler will together contain enough code to <i>make</i> it work if they&#x27;re any good at all.",1416895310

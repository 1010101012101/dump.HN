The scheduling, reporting, and flexible alerting has been well worth it to us.<p>Before PagerDuty we were using Nagios with a modem dialing out to pagers. Later we went to Nagios with email to SMS gateways. We had ""problems"" with email to SMS delivery and no way to tell if it was a bad employee or flaky cellco gateway. We also had problems with scheduling on call rotation & overrides for vacation.<p>The escalation/accountability & reporting let us weed out a bad employee that was ignoring pages. We suspected it but phone call delivery with confirmation in Pagerduty ensured there weren't any plausible excuses.<p>Most importantly it makes scheduling oncall rotations painless.<p>Yes, you can do all this in plain old Nagios with enough time or hackery. We reached a point where we couldn't waste time on that kind of hackery (changing alert schedules & escalation every time someone went on vacation, google calendar to nagios config scripts) and needed it to just work.<p>These APIs are just icing on top. I have two projects that will benefit immediately: \n1. Our customer service manager has been asking for a easy way to tell who is on call and we didn't want to give her a pager duty login. Now I can make a simple ""who is on call?"" dashboard so the call center knows who to call if there's a problem monitoring missed.\n2. With the Integration Triggers we can open Jira tickets for incidents. This will streamline workflow.",1346992694

To be fair, I'd say the Chinese here generally don't consider dialect groups to be major divisions any more - it's more a point of curiosity, a minor variation for most people. Among the older generation, perhaps, but the time of actual conflict and distrust between the groups is essentially long gone, steamrolled by government language policy. It was hard enough for me to learn to speak Hokkien, because my circles are English-dominated.<p>This is all to say that it could be argued that Singapore is a Chinese-majority nation, but it doesn't take away from the fact that there are many Malays and Indians here, and many foreigners of all stripes (Indians, Europeans, Americans). Foreigners make up 2m of our 5.2m people (38%), which is pretty shocking really (500k of them have become permanent residents, though).<p>I'd say that in the context of primary schools here, diversity isn't at a true melting-pot level. Furthermore, education among Chinese families is pursued in the same aggressive way as in other East Asian nations - the majority of students have supplementary tutoring, sometimes from the early grades. The culture of academic emphasis among parents is in line with the government's pedadogical efforts, which results in high achievement levels.<p>This is not to take away from the success of the Singaporean mathematics curriculum, which is quite outstanding by most measures - probably because it was designed by mathematicians and teachers in tandem, drawing on the best practices in the world known at the time (the late 70s/early 80s).

You should make it clear that should someone win you will go full forensic on them.

You can do investigation with humans which makes attacks harder, and also scales (you only need to investigate the limited number of winners rather than all participants).<p>As 0xEA mentioned you can go network effect on them too.  For example you can require that winners had Facebooked/Tweeted something at the time of their entry.

It's only ""zero"" because you're greatly overestimating the cost of intercepting the traffic at all.<p>To do dragnet surveillance you need an optical tap, an expensive phy, and a fairly modest number of gates to apply a stateless filter purely from onchip memory to capture 100% of interesting flows and grab some small fraction of all other traffic, and some modest switch fabric to carry captured data to a modest amount of storage and processing to deal with it. Programmed correctly commodity network processors for switches have all the right logic already, we're talking in the <$200 per 10G port parts-cost level. Detailed analysis of the sample data and the known-interesting data gives tells you about new hosts you should be matching for detailed inspection (and you update the can filter with 50ms latencies or so).  The cost of maintaining a cheap military aircraft gets your terabits of sampling capacity.<p>Adding a MITM attack on top of the model used for dragnet surveillance currently, which involves intercepting 100% of the potentially interesting traffic at all times, performing a costly public key operation per every single connection, and then reencrypting the results is insanely expensive by comparison.

4487673,comment,4485767,4486894,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"What's interesting is that the senior leaders of Singapore were often trained in engineering, and some have attributed their technocratic and unpopulist approaches to the engineering mindset. For them, it's all about making things that work, but the secondary/knock-on effects sometimes don't get considered or noticed until it's too late.<p>Funnily enough, in our media it was reported that of late, students receiving top-level government scholarships to the US/UK/elsewhere hardly ever choose engineering any more, but study economics instead (probably influenced by the dominance of the financial industry). So the next generation of Singapore leaders may very well be dominated by economics trainees - I wonder what sort of government we'll get, then? Certainly a more diverse one, but also one lacking in engineers and scientists.",1346990710

[edit: crap now I can't do that the buttons gone]<p>I also tried to look into the behavior and it turns out what we're running into here is a 'gap lock' necessary to support ranges in statement based replication (the default).  You can change the behavior if you're using row based replication its just not the default.<p>For instance if the second transaction in your example was ""BETWEEN 7 and 10"" then both transactions would run concurrently no problem, its acting like row+1 level locking.<p>Here's a much more detailed explanation: <a href=""http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/03/27/innodbs-gap-locks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/03/27/innodbs-gap-l...</a>",1346990669

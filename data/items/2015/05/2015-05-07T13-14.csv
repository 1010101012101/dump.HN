It&#x27;s stuff like distributed failover, exotic driver support, SAN, management etc. that they are missing. Big data center stuff, the kind of thing companies like Red Hat make.<p>Those kinds of products are huge investments. Sure Apple might be able to market towards the enterprise, but they simply don&#x27;t think there is any money to be made. They used to have for instance Xserve that tried to stay afloat in that market, but which made little money. Since they canceled it, Mac OS has only been developed as a small to medium server (which it isn&#x27;t half bad at). But big time data centers are a different world.<p>For instance, as a very basic example, does Mac OS support Infiniband or the more exotic high-speed ethernet network interfaces? For Infiniband, the answer is no and in the other case the answer is &quot;kinda, but not really.&quot;",1431007098

But the kind of problems that lead to Heartbleed aren&#x27;t likely to be a problem in low-level crypto implementations. This is because they tend to operate on fixed-size buffers using algorithms with little or no conditional logic. While there could certainly be mathematical flaws (i.e. producing the wrong output), something like a buffer overrun is not likely here.<p>If you look in basically any crypto library, you will find important primitives implemented in assembly.

There&#x27;s this thing called a &quot;radio&quot;, and this other thing called a &quot;telephone&quot;. Quoting from <a href=""http://www.troopers.ny.gov/introduction/History/1930s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.troopers.ny.gov/introduction/History/1930s/</a> :<p>> The most important development of the decade was the initiation of modern communications systems. In 1931 the Division inaugurated its teletypewriter system, the forerunner of the New York Statewide Police Information System the Division operates today. The significance of this was clearly recognized by Superintendent Warner, who wrote in the 1931 Annual Report, &quot;The most forward looking step since the organization of the New York State Troopers was the installation of a modern system of communications.&quot; The impact that the teletype network would have on interagency cooperation was likewise recognized. <i>&quot;The system coordinates the efforts of all police departments, State and municipal,&quot; wrote Superintendent Warner, &quot;and unites them in one solid organization for the prevention of crime and apprehension of offenders.&quot;</i> [Emphasis mine.]<p>Somehow in the 1930s the police were doing what the author says isn&#x27;t currently possible.<p>&quot;However, since law enforcement agencies do not share information, other local law enforcement officers and agencies were unaware of the threat, as was the Texas DPS.&quot;<p>As a blanket statement, also utter BS. Law enforcement agencies have shared information for a very long time.<p>Nor is the analysis complete. The account of how Melvin Hale shot and killed Randall Vetter is used as if it&#x27;s representative of how officers get killed. There are many reasons for the shooting. Others include Hale&#x27;s anger over increased taxes, Hale&#x27;s anger over the seatbelt law, and Hale&#x27;s possession of a .223 Mini-14 carbine.<p>Had there been no seatbelt law, or had there been strict controls on weapons, or had Hale been arrested earlier for not paying taxes, then it&#x27;s also likely that Vetter would not have been killed. I personally suspect that stricter gun control laws would lead to fewer dead police officers than throwing more technology at the problem.<p>There is also the problem of stale and incorrect data. How long is information kept in the system? How do citizens know if they are being incorrectly targeted? Who has the ability to add special flags? We know this is a problem with the No Fly lists, when a Stanford University doctoral student was added to the list because an FBI agent didn&#x27;t follow the instructions and checked a box by mistake. It will certainly be a more frequent problem for any less well curated list.",1431005190

Second, DS gets the lock-in <i>and</i> &quot;commoditizes&quot; Twitter&#x27;s offering, by putting it right beside a dozen other &quot;sources&quot;.

DataSift had a time-limited contract and it ran out. Their competitor (Gnip) apparently delivered a useful product by spending far less money.<p>(Of note is that FB&#x27;s new sentiment analysis data product is being trialed via DataSift. This feels like a similar thing, with the added benefit that if it goes sour (&quot;omg FB is literally selling our data/feelings&quot;), they&#x27;ve got a slight degree of separation.

The university professor had the security of tenure and was looking forward to a defined benefit pension starting six years from now. The corporate attorney was finishing up a prosperous career. The engineers who’d chosen to work in industry, however, were a varied lot. A woman who’d taken a job at a defense contractor was still there, 30 years later. The super-wizard Lisp Machine programmer was now in a senior technical, but non-supervisory role, at a multi-billion dollar dotcom (not necessarily getting paid more than a competent 30-year-old, however).

There are people who prefer using things like mq (patchset queues), which until recently also was Mozilla&#x27;s recommended workflow.  Queues are a novel way to organise your work in progress, but is quite different from what people are used to coming from svn or git.<p>More recently bookmarks were added (also as an extension you have to opt-in to), which are  reminiscent of git branches.  They make it possible to have a HEAD-based workflow where you rebase frequently, much like you would with git, only that the defaults of `hg log` and various other commands don&#x27;t interop very well, which means you have to memorise a lot of flags and arguments.<p>There are also many strange defaults in hg that you simply have to get used to, for example that `hg push` by default pushes everything.  I have a hook in place on the remote end which prevents me from doing that.<p>By far the most frustrating experience with hg is that you cannot expect the default installation to come with sensible defaults.  The argument is that keeping &quot;advanced&quot; functionality out of core prevents new users from accidentally using it.<p>An unintended consequence is that it sometimes makes it difficult for other people to help when you&#x27;re stuck because more often than not their environment won&#x27;t match yours.<p>One frequently lauded aspect of hg is that the user interface is easier to understand.  Whilst I appreciate difference in taste, my experience is the opposite.  If you follow the HEAD-based bookmark-style workflow, I find many cognitive dissonances in how the bookmark feature interacts with other commands.<p>At Mozilla we use hg for the canonical repositories and we have many Mozilla related extensions, but whereas I use hg every day now and it&#x27;s a fine experience as long as I stay within the marked lines, I would return to git in a heartbeat if I had the chance.",1431003783

We know many major vendors (HTC, Samsung, Sony) ship OpenCL drivers on their latest hardware. We also know that Google does not ship the drivers on Nexus devices.\nWe are trying to generate a consolidated list of devices that have OpenCL support. If you guys can install the app from the bottom to test it on your phone and provide us some feedback it will be great. The following information will be useful.<p>- Device Name<p>- OpenCL on GPU: Yes / NO<p>- OpenCL on CPU: Yes / NO<p>- Android Version<p>- Roms you are using (e.g. touchwiz / Sense / Cyanogenmod)<p>App: OpenCL Info(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xh.openclinfo&hl=en)\n<i></i>This app was not developed by us. We are using this for testing because it is simpler than the alternatives<i></i>",1403812772
7951342,comment,7950598,7951311,1,0,jacquesm,,,"Yes, definitely. I think the .com thing is an anomaly, I would not be surprised if we think of .coms as fondly as we think of rotary telephones attached to a wall today.<p>Having a &#x27;nice&#x27; phone number was really important at some point, easy to remember. Now we all have address books.<p>The DNS is nice, it works well and I&#x27;m sure that it will continue to work well for a long time. But gtlds are the same as area codes and I have absolutely no idea what having an area code of &#x27;1&#x27; would mean for a business that is not in the United States.<p>.coms used to be pretty much the standard, I see many more people launching more and more successful businesses on non .com domains. Given enough time (ok, probably a lot) the weight of a .com will likely reduce to the point where it is just another identifier. Maybe we&#x27;ll all be scanning QR codes, maybe browsers will in fact hide the domain, maybe at some point you&#x27;ll never type on in again.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the DNS will die completely, I just think that the length of a domain will not be as important any more. But if you brand happens to be LL then you&#x27;d better have LL.com, that probably is a given for the foreseeable future. Weight Watchers, World Wildlife Foundation and World Wrestling are obvious contenders but even they were not interested. So now some Chinese company will run with it, I&#x27;m curious how they will fare and what they will do with it.",1403812758

This is the standard way of managing dependencies, and would mean not having to manually upload scripts to a folder restart the bot every time you need to add or change the scripts.<p>The maintainer shortly thereafter attempted to do it himself his way, ended up with a bug-ridden and memory-leaking implementation that barely worked, and sits languishing in a lonely branch.<p>Don&#x27;t make assumptions about the code you didn&#x27;t see and the attitudes involved coders might have. We would have been (and still would be) more than happy to help maintain it had the bot turned out useful for us, but because it was a new project and the structure was changing constantly, attempting to fork and integrate upstream changes would have been a nightmare, so we decided to go a different direction.",1403812603

It&#x27;s easy to donate money to a charitable organization or volunteer  somewhere.

Why do you think you need additional tooling?<p>If you have a health check that checks that php-fpm works, it should need no or minimal adaption to handle the new scenario. The only &quot;new&quot; thing is that the processes have a different parent process than usual and is running in different namespaces. If you didn&#x27;t care about healthchecks for php-fpm before, there&#x27;s no reason to care about them now.<p>> For every single service in your architecture you are adding an additional level of redundant complexity because it &quot;helps you scale&quot;.<p>You see it as adding complexity, I see it as <i>reducing</i> complexity: By wrapping each bit in a Docker container, I gain:<p>- Explicit documentation of the dependencies necessary for each components. I know it covers at least what is needed, because otherwise the component will fail; as opposed to documentation which easily becomes obsolete.<p>- Each container is limited in what it can access, ensuring that <i>interdependencies</i> between the containers are documented and explicit.<p>- Versioning of e.g. system packages can evolve separately for each component, without needing separate (heavier) full vms.<p>> I can spin up as many app containers as I want, as often as I want without a second thought or a moment&#x27;s consideration<p>That&#x27;s great, as long as all components of the app use sufficiently few resources, and are easy enough to run in parallel. E.g. have fun if one of the components of this container is a Postgres install and all the instances needs a consistent view of the database. Or if one of the components needs tons of memory and you end up running out of memory even if there was no need to run more of that component in parallel.<p>For some apps that&#x27;s not an issue. For others it is, and even starting a second instance of the full stack becomes a huge waste of resources or a huge added complexity vs. starting more of a specific component.<p>> The scale you are talking about is when you need more than just a couple load balancers...and you aren&#x27;t going to need that for 90% of projects.<p>The scale I&#x27;m talking about is anything from a single, small home server, where you may want to spin up more web servers for experimentation but not need more than a single database server, to large clusters.

7951228,comment,7950102,7951031,2,0,Joeri,,,"I&#x27;d like to comment on this remark: &quot;Tools that are &quot;just JavaScript.&quot; Not tools where you describe your app in a DSL (no Sencha). This is to avoid requiring too much knowledge of the framework itself before being able to contribute. Focusing on JavaScript also offers some protection against investing too heavily in framework-specific knowledge.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been using ExtJS since 2008, so I can give some experience here. What he says is absolutely true. The DSL of ExtJS does slow down ramp-up for new developers and requires an investment in learning the framework before you can use it.<p>However, I would like to point out there is a reason for the DSL. The DSL abstracts away the low level details of HTML so you can think at the level of ui elements. HTML&#x27;s controls are very basic. Instead of comboboxes it has selects, which are quite inflexible. Instead of grids it has tables, which are also quite weak. The date field is minimal and in fact missing in older browsers. The list goes on and on. HTML is simply not rich enough to express desktop-level ui&#x27;s elegantly. You can deal with that in two ways: embrace it and dumb down the ui (hence the trend towards minimal ui), or work around it and build a DSL on top of HTML. The core theory behind the rich DSL of ExtJS is that by bumping up the abstraction level developers can be more proficient. It is OO encapsulation at the UI level.<p>That is the theory. In practice it is a mixed bag. You have the same problem with ExtJS on top of HTML as you have with an ORM on top of a  SQL db. You need to understand both what happens underneath and what the tool does on top of that. The cognitive load is higher, not lower. Some people thrive in that and are more proficient in the DSL than they would be in a raw templating view-driven environment. Others struggle with the larger amount of layers involved and are slowed down by the approach, and then some people fall in between and see no productivity difference. YMMV.<p>Update: one additional thing that I&#x27;d point out is that being opinionated and investing deep with a framework is not a bad thing when you&#x27;re building a large long-lived codebase. If you&#x27;re going to be living in a codebase for years, it makes sense to have as much application backbone (pun intended) as possible before you start building code on top of that. If you assemble a hodge-podge of smaller modules you&#x27;re essentially constructing your own big framework anyway, so you might as well bite the bullet and choose a consistent one. The notion that you&#x27;re ever going to switch js frameworks on a large single-page-app codebase is silly. The cost will always outweigh the benefits.",1403811189

However, let me stress that the message is <i>not</i> &quot;you&#x27;re using Docker wrong unless you&#x27;re using it our way&quot;. I see how it can be read like that, but the real message is much more technical, complicated and nuanced. The message is fourfold:<p>1. Your <i>Unix system</i> is wrong unless it conforms to certain technical requirements.<p>2. Explanation of the requirements.<p>3. One possible solution that satisfies these requirements: Baseimage-docker.<p>4. Does your image already satisfy the requirements? Great. If not, you can implement these requirements yourself, but why bother when you can grab Baseimage-docker? And oh, it happens to contain some useful stuff that are not <i>strictly</i> necessary but that lots of.<p>As you can see, such a complicated message becomes waaay too long and hard to explain to most people. It probably only makes sense if you&#x27;ve contributed to the Linux kernel, or read an operating systems book. If I explained it in a way that&#x27;s too technical and nuanced, 99% of the people will fall asleep after reading 1 paragraph. So the message was simplified. I apologize if the simplified message has offended you, and I am continuing to finetune the message.<p>As the for the PID 1 issue: I genuinely thought you guys didn&#x27;t include a PID 1 <i>on purpose</i>, because running one isn&#x27;t that hard. Last time I talked to Jerome, he had the opinion that, if software couldn&#x27;t deal with zombie processes existing on the system, it&#x27;s a bug in the software. With that response in mind, I thought that the Docker team does not recognize the PID 1 issue as really an issue. So please do not mistake the lack of a bug report as malice.<p>Later on, you told me that you guys are working on this, and I was glad to hear that.<p>I get the feeling that you feel bitter about the fact that I chose to write Baseimage-docker instead of contributing a PID 1 to Docker. Please understand that I did not do this out of any adversarial intentions. My Go skills are minimal and I am busy enough with other stuff. This, combined with the fact that at the time I thought the PID 1 issue was simply not recognized, led to me write Baseimage-docker.

The simple fact is, that I was able to build a site in ONE NIGHT after work using bootstrap as the basis for my design. Using anything less featured (and less familiar to me) than Bootstrap would have added enormous amounts of time before I could release. The site in question was able to get some traction because of its timely release and I am iterating on that now and growing.<p>The idea that using Bootstrap cost me time is objectively wrong, as is that of it costing me money. Currently, my minified CSS and javascript from bootstrap is not affecting the page load time in any significant way. For me, using Bootstrap for MVPs has proved supremely useful, time and time again. I would not be as bold as you and claim my experience is applicable to everyone, but it is obviously very beneficial for me.<p>Something not often considered by the haters is that most of the time, the customers that the MVP is directed at have no clue about Bootstrap. Unless I&#x27;m building something for developers, it&#x27;s usually not something they have seen before. I&#x27;ve actually gotten many compliments on design, when it was largely just Bootstrap&#x27;s CSS.<p>Further, putting some structure in for SASS typography isn&#x27;t the same as creating good typography. I&#x27;ve found it extremely difficult to create readable, custom typography in the past and I&#x27;m quite sure I am not alone.<p>Your &quot;framework&quot; gives me some kind of grid system, some structure that I can go out and create my own typography system inside of and some kind of functionality to &quot;reset&quot; forms.

I&#x27;ve used Amazon&#x27;s AWS, Rackspace and Azure. Azure is hands down the best. Nadella was formerly in charge of Azure, so it&#x27;s no surprise that Azure is coming to the forefront of Microsoft.

The UI library they used to make the website above is open source (WinJS <a href=""https://github.com/winjs/winjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/winjs/winjs</a>). They are making obvious efforts to engage the developer community.<p>* Whilst everybody else is scrambling to create walled gardens and closed platforms, Microsoft is going in the opposite direction. All of their recent open source releases have been on Github, not Codeplex. You can provision linux virtual machines, mysql database, redis caches on azure - as well as the Microsoft equivalents. They just announced they&#x27;re making an Android handset after acquiring Nokia, as well as Windows Phone. They&#x27;ve announced that they will start supporting officially supporting Mono (open source version of their .NET clr) with new releases of ASP.NET, allowing ASP.NET applications to run on open source platforms.<p>* Their share price is the highest it&#x27;s been in 15 years<p>EDIT:<p>* And as much as I hate to admit it (I haven&#x27;t personally switched browsers or search providers yet...) but they&#x27;re actually fixing the problems with Bing and Internet Explorer, and seem to be rapidly catching up with the pack.

That&#x27;s a problem, though, if you want to create new randomness, because you put into the game two random bits and you get out less than two random bits!  If you want to get out more randomness than you put in, you need to be a little more clever and more stingy with using random bits.<p>(If the players are honest, the first player&#x27;s output is uniformly random, but the second player&#x27;s output is ~85% predictable given the first player&#x27;s output.  Measured in terms of entropy, this means you are getting a fraction more than 1 bit out.)<p>The standard 50/50 CHSH is still useful for generating randomness, though.  Even though it uses up more randomness than it creates, the output randomness can be of higher <i>quality</i> than the input randomness.

On the other hand, it&#x27;s impossible to deliver criticism in a way that doesn&#x27;t tear at the relationship at least a little, and easy to deliver it in a way that tears at the relationship a lot. It can be hard to let go of the thought that: &quot;if he/she just did X, Y would be better.&quot; But in many cases, fixing whatever our partner is doing wrong doesn&#x27;t justify the stress of the criticism. As my wife says: &quot;being right isn&#x27;t a defense to the charge of being an asshole.&quot;",1403809720

Different people use Docker for different purposes, that is normal and a fundamental goal of Docker.<p>I do have criticism for your <i>communication</i> around that base image, starting with the link-bait blog post &quot;you&#x27;re using Docker wrong&quot;. Your message is that anybody not using Docker <i>your</i> way (full-blown init process, sshd, embedded syslog) is doing it wrong. That is not only incorrect, it contradicts Docker&#x27;s philosophy of allowing and supporting more than one usage pattern.<p>My other criticism is that you point out a known Docker bug (the pid1 issue) and use it as a selling point for your image, without concerning yourself with reporting the bug let alone contributing to a fix. Meanwhile many people hit the same pid1 bug and have reported, suggested possible fixes, or contributed code to help implement that fix. If you want to be taken seriously in the Docker community, my recommendation is that you consider doing the same.",1403809687

But most leads won&#x27;t give you friction if you mention that they need to log in to receive access to your secured investor area - it&#x27;s not hard to understand that your company material cannot be out in the public; and the tracking part is not ever mentioned from experience.<p>Our primary goal with this product is to give the presentation owner a full background picture on their leads. There is no email + password sign up possible to evade that process as a conscious choice - no escape routes. If it&#x27;s a big friction for an investor - by all means send him the PDF.<p>About frictionless sharing :\n A) We believe the business owner would like to know who sees his presentation, which areas they are interested in, and when they see it ( and PDFs don&#x27;t provide any of that )\n B) We are planning to add &#x27;invite links&#x27; in the future, so leads can simply share to other leads by typing in their email address.

7951073,comment,7951071,7951071,9,0,Sean-Der,,,"fail2ban is one the most under appreciated tools on small to medium Unix servers. I was first introduced to it when administering some web facing Asterisk servers (FreePBX) and was quickly impressed with its effectiveness/simplicity.<p>However, one of the issues I ran into was that people in the field were really frustrated by it on a day to day basis. They were accidentally getting themselves banned, and instead of unbanning themselves they would just turn fail2ban off all together. Some people didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using fail2ban-client and others just felt like it took to much time.<p>And so fail2web was born! Fail2web gives you basic fail2ban administration abilities. You can manage bannedIPs, fail regexes and a few other per jail settings, with a lot more stuff planned in the future.<p>While building this I also ended up building a Go library that abstract aways fail2ban communication (<a href=""https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2go</a>) which is used by the REST server that powers fail2web (<a href=""https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2rest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2rest</a>). The fail2rest server could also be used for other cool projects, I am in the process of using it to distribute bans across multiple servers and using it for health checks.<p>The tech stack for this project also was a lot of fun using. For this project I am communicating with a long running Python process that exposes information via a socket that gives pickled output so I used the awesome library (<a href=""https://github.com/kisielk/og-rek"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kisielk/og-rek</a>) I also had a lot of fun building the frontend in angularjs, angular-ui with browserify.

As someone who doesn&#x27;t use containers or virtualization heavily, but maintains multiple systems (servers, desktops, phones, etc), I can unequivocally say that SSH is practically a hard requirement. And just having it as the way to get to a container seems like a no-brainer, in that you don&#x27;t have to learn yet another tool, that might not work, and even if it does, won&#x27;t cover all the use cases of SSH. I use SSH for remote admin <i>and</i> automated backups of <i>everything</i> (phones, tablets, servers, desktops, etc). Adding another thing to be backed up via SSH is easy, no matter if it&#x27;s virtual or not.<p>EDIT: I <i>do</i> really like the separation of concerns and modularity that are brought about by the approach advanced in the article. <i>But</i> I would argue that the arguments against SSH apply many times more strongly against alternatives to it: security upgrades? You&#x27;re going to have to do that much more often with whatever you use to replace SSH. SSH has proven track record for security and authentication, it&#x27;s well known, lightweight, and generally doesn&#x27;t break on its own.",1403809223
